M	i did query this and at_least by me calling he has assured me that it will be sent by courier tonight so as long as it does arrive tomorrow will only have been 0days to return and in this period prices have been decreasing on the other_sites , they also do not return any accessories that may have been sent with the phone regardless to whether you take the new offer or not as these are " recycled as soon as the item arrives " i can only_assume i will now have no charger for the phone when it returns
F	didn_'_t turn_up within time took 00 weeks .
F	i think the return_policy should be longer .
F	!
M	are not due until next week .
F	have new and better cover policy with lv and will be cancelling columbus policy
M	i subsequently booked a return with p_& o with no problem at all although of couse this cost me extra money .
F	i have used event_tyres now at_least 0 times both at home and at work and have found the tyre_fitters amiable , efficient and trustworthy .
F	bigger is not always better value .
M	no_hassle put my order in straight_forward and no_problems with the delivery first_class nothing else i can say
F	they were quick with the delivery and the website is very user_friendly and easy to navigate .
M	i subsequently received a call from the shop saying that there had been a delay at the suppliers and they expected the stock " imminently " ( though i give them credit for getting in touch ).
F	we can intervene if an advertisement seems likely to be in breach of the uk code of non - broadcast advertising by , among other things , being likely to provoke serious or widespread offence , risking causing significant harm or being materially misleading .
F	when my friend booked with chilli - sauce she specifically_requested the ibis hotel at explore lane bristol and we '_d stayed there on mine and loved how close it was to prism which was in our event .
M	i asked_him what it means " young driver " and he said : " you have to have your driving_licence for at_least 0 . or 0 . years , otherwise you pay 0 euro_per day ".
M	as stated above there was a message from microsoft stating that there was a security certification problem with this website and strongly advising not to proceed with use of this website .
F	yodel are terrible with delivery , as they won_'_t leave the box if your not in not even with a neighbour my poor cat had to wait nearly 0_weeks !
F	they also weren_'_t delivered until 0 . 00pm on the day of my mum '_s birthday , which is why she was out when they were delivered .
M	we have found our orders can easily be forgotten and collection and delivery is an additional 0 days due to an outside contractor collecting the order .
F	0st_class service .
M	i am still trying to come to terms with the new glasses which seem to be taking a while to adjust to my eyes .
F	i had also bought a shower_head that was too small , so i ordered another one .
M	first_class product - brilliant price - brilliant delivery .
M	this was not the first time i '_ve had stuff thrown over my wall by their drivers .
M	delivery was fine and everything seemed good until i attempted to put the flush together and realised the refill tube was missing which meant i could not install the toilet .
M	ordered a ram_upgrade from mr_memory and received it within a week . and i live in new_zealand :-))
M	the villa_itself could be excellent , but is in dire need of a thorough clean at the very least but ideally a refurb .
M	orca promised to prepare my order and they did , and very efficiently .
F	sadly they arrived aferwards .
M	succulent products which are hard to match and priced at a reasonable cost .
M	going to see if i have anymore now
M	the order was effortless and they delivered when they said they would .
F	which was fine just wished they would have told be before hand .
M	just go to dabs or amazon .
F	i don_'_t recommend this company what so ever !
M	thank_you vanillamart
M	so if i returned the item , i would no_longer have it ( obviously ) and i would be more out of pocket than if i kept it , ( and obviosuly still had the item !)
F	total illegal sales_techniques and from the look of it on here is not in any way an_isolated case !
M	a couple of sleeves had storage / handling wear including bends , but nothing too serious for 00 year_old records .
M	recently_purchased a htc phone , received a tv 0 days_later !
F	our friend comes round and he , with a clear , unhindered head , sets it all out , and he says – ' its all the roof .
M	just what you want .
M	great service !.
F	normally great on delivery front , however do not update their tracking website very well so you could be sitting in for a delivery that wont turn_up
M	an email received a phone_call next_day and the part the day after .
F	ordered 0 pairs of glasses .
F	the sink has a ' dip ' ( not a damage dent ) on one side on the top .
M	very good quality , and fit in beautifully in their new surroundings .
F	although my sister rang to thank me for the flowers i get the impression that the flowers were a lot smaller_than i expected as i up - graged to deluxe also the vase i purchased was described to me as being very small .
M	on friday i received a letter saying they had tried and failed to contact me by phone and email ( yet i had had no emails from them , no missed calls .) and that there was a problem and could i call them .
M	anyway 0 hours_later we_boarded the next one , and then ate the worst fish and chips i have ever had .
F	customer service was very difficult to get through to and when i did eventually , promised to call me back and failed to do that .
F	the price of this product was best by far !
F	i purchased the super hooded parka jacket . my partner bought me this for christmas in a size medium ( size00 ) as i am a size 00 / 00 and i could not move in the jacket at all .
F	myself and a friend booked a spa day through this company .
F	shocked at the cost of postage ?
F	needless to say i waited in all morning ; nothing arrived , called up at 00_noon only to be told that no delivery had been booked !!
F	watch shop have great products and i have never_experienced any_problems with them .
M	so the sailing date was put back to friday the 0th of july .
M	once booked the service is great .
F	the curtain packaging quoted one size but the curtains were another !
M	the tv arrived 0 days_later , which was good , however i noticed that the tv had been shipped from france , which seemed odd .
M	the hotel is sited well for airport and bus 000 from airport goes reasonably close .
F	slightly_disappointed .
F	at 0 . 00 i called the support number and was told that mechanic would be there " within the hour ".
F	the site was easy to view . so tempting to buy more than wanted .
M	a replacement pair arrived the following_day .
F	this was 0_weeks after i raised the issue .
M	ordered before 00 : 00 .
M	use a superb courier , delivered on time to the exact minute !
M	i wish all companies behaved like this one does .
M	fortunately i had also contacted edimax before emailing kikatek support and had everything sorted_out so i didnt require an rma .
M	it was all done very professionally and as though it was all no bother to them - i was treated to great service and cannot recommend them enough .
F	to your reply 0_days before the event is taking the mick as i know the person selling the tickets will already have them in they were released months_ago how do i know to trust the person_who is selling the tickets , have you not noticed the other reviews you have here stating that people have had problems with getting tickets in the past i do not see many happy customer reviews
F	i had an order turn_up with a product missing ( the top of the package had been sliced , i assume at the courier depot ) and i was refunded straight_away as a replacement could not be sent .
M	when i first phoned , i spoke to tony who was excellent in helping_me understand and at the appointment chose the ring that i wanted .
M	once again , please_accept our apologies for the inconvenience or frustration that has_been caused on this occasion .
M	use travel_republic as they are cheaper and send you to the correct hotel
M	i would always recommend the company for price , quality and service .
F	while it does_state this on the website it '_s not very clear and would ideally be on the paperwork when the item is originally sent , to avoid_confusion .
F	if i hadn_'_t noticed it i doubt they would have as the first customer service representative i spoke to was insistent that i had only registered with the site and not actually ordered anything .
M	received the next_day .
F	i only liked one pair of the ones i trialled so i took a risk on the second_pair .
F	i am so please i found this site and would highly_recommend .
F	i rang up to say how disappointed i was but they just said i could have the colour of the tint changed but couldn_'_t have the colour made stronger .
M	you can have next_day delivery , but that '_s at a cost of another £ 0 .
M	but beware of network_coverage
M	despite my communication requesting the change of an item to one in stock , nothing was sent .
F	when you want a quality product at a reasonable_price from a company whose customer service and order fulfillment are top - notch , choose zazzle !
M	i found fonebank via a comparison site ( moneysavingexpert . com ) and for the two phones i was getting_rid of ( a 0 year_old noka and a 0 year_old_htc ) the prices were the best offered .
F	delivery was free which was a huge_bonus .
M	top_marks
M	when the replacement was sent out by amazon it was sent by citylink again .
F	bought 0 pairs of shoes .
F	i used floraqueen to send some birthday flowers to my sister in south_africa .
F	improvements
M	i have been using ' strings_direct ' for all my guitar_strings and plectrums for a number of years_now .
M	i happened to telephone father who was in some distress over the incident and the threat of further_action_against him embodied in the text of the chit .
M	so i got setback for a super shitty car like vw_polo by 000 € plus the 00 £ i paid already .
F	i finally_managed to get a phone_call from a supervisor who acknowledged that there had been an_error on the app .
F	i haven_'_t treated either pair badly , so am very disappointed that i now have a useless pair of glasses after such a short_period of time .
F	i really don_’_t want anyone to have to go through what i did so please don_'_t use this company !!!!!!!!!!!
F	regards
M	i '_m moving provider .
M	easy to order easy payment_methods and prompt delivery
F	le service clientèle n ' est apparemment qu_' un intermédiaire sans aucun pouvoir concernant le suivi des commandes et / ou des réclamations !
M	however , with the fact that i got the refund i will give them 0 extra star , no more .
M	each time i clean my glasses , the lens pops in and out of position .
M	sometimes i am reluctant to leave a feedback but here i am now leaving a positive_feedback due to how samantha deal with me today and that represent and galvanise how the company works , i '_m impress , very happy .
F	she then told me that the delivery company had lost it and it would have to be delivered the next_day instead .
F	we ignored everything as i felt i had used up enough time dealing_with an incompetent company .
F	bitterly_disappointed and the florist was extremely rude
F	i had phoned around a few companies for quotes , but this was the best by far !
M	this has to be their decision .
F	she telephoned more handles for product advice & was very impressed with their knowledge & service .
F	on trying to switch they have produced an £ 0000 bill after we have paid every_month and they now claim the meter never worked . what and you never thought to tell us , and why was it irractic amounts which were dressed_up to look like it was an actual reading ?
M	i have contacted the 0 times by email and have not received one reply
M	at stonehenge there was time to walk around and view .
F	the service we received was extremely responsive , informative , reassuring and helpful .
F	concerns abound . if hot_water isn_'_t available for paying guests ?
M	i would give no stars if it was permitted .
F	it arrived very quickly and is perfect .
F	would definitely recommend , happy to use again .
M	i had the misfortune of dealing_with this company after buying a groupon_voucher for some banksy prints back in march .
M	when we rang dom & gen they were not surprised we were cancelling the ao offering .
M	flight bag arrived promptly , very well_packaged and was a fantastic price .
M	the delivery is very fast too !
M	how great to have a service that allowed_me to order a custom cut work top so close to christmas and have it arrive on time as promised without_any hassles or difficulty . its good to know there are businesses out there that can harness the internet to provide a service that is still personal and reliable .
F	until i found simplysupplements i was suffering regular periods of ibs , in fact it had started to happen 0 - 0 times a week which curtailed my life no end .
F	the shed was delivered on the day they said it would be .
M	three_times !
F	i didn_'_t receive my items until the following thursday !
M	i bought two things online both from croydon .
F	all i encountered was a stonewall - my questions were ignored ; they suggested that the flowers had arrived ; they prevaricated , and offered no constructive points at all .
F	i called immediately and was advised that for whatever_reason they were not able to change the card over .
M	i have placed orders with 000 blinds twice - very recently and about 00 months_ago .
M	i checked the tracking on the 00th and it had not even reached their delivery depot which was only 00 miles from their hub .
M	the choosing process was easy and the website easy to navigate .
M	i wish i could attach a pictuie of the arrangement i purchased verses what actaully arrived , along with the fact that i also paid for chocolates which weren_'_t delivered .
F	almost every time i had to call to find out the status of transaction .
F	great service as very quick delivery thanks !
F	their range of goods is different and the product i ordered , waxidoodles , appears to be good value for money , well_packed and presented .
F	they have assured me i had been changed to correct single rate tariff as i used to need economy 0 but after ringing to confirm this i was told it actually hadn_'_t been done at all , despite telling them to 0 times .
M	a great service giving extensive product range at a good price .
M	aways on time the drivers are plight and always helpful .
F	i just love it and would recommend it if you want to feel sensual and feminine .
F	completely_unacceptable , i will never be using this site again and advise you not to .
F	the qualitie and the lay_out are excellent will certainly use photo_world again .
M	for the first couple of years everything_went well .
F	bit bored of flyers , mugs and pens so googled this product .
F	neither when the wrong fabric was delivered , or the right one , was i sent an_email to tell me the order had been dispatched - pure_luck i was in each time .
M	i had a few questions before i ordered apex handlebars for my falco by e_- mail .
F	this business thinks it is perfectly acceptable to mislead their customers when ordering , then charge them £ 0 . 00 for a second class royal_mail delivery ( which it '_s worth_noting is their company policy ) to be sent out whenever the item finally becomes in stock .
M	the product was delivered very quickly
F	on the 00th_april i ordered 0 nars products from hq_hair .
F	found this company very good reasonable_prices , was kept_informed of my product by email , was changes made and made to how i wanted it .
F	my partner had to stay in the following_day which was annoying , but thankfully the faulty cot was collected and a replacement cot was delivered at the same time which was great and cot was fine .
F	i had difficulty paying with my bank cards online and finally had to use paypal when neither my debit_card nor my credit_card would authorise the transaction without_any good reason .
M	will be using again .
F	not happy as i wanted to take on holiday .
M	its an_absolute travesty and we are seriously_considering switching providers .
F	there was no need as everything went to plan and was excellent .
M	i arrived at the store was asked if i where taking the washing_machine away with me .
F	there was a secure checkout , a text_message the following_day to say it had been posted and then it '_s prompt arrival and well_packaged .
M	two prescription orders placed - quickly delilvered
F	i was recommended to switch tariffs to save money . and then was charged_£_000 for the set_up of it - their error they said , but they took the funds out of my account without my knowledge anyway , then to get it back was a nightmare !!!
F	i was really impressed with the drop box delivery service , easy and convienient .
M	i couldn_'_t be_happier .
F	wait_til someone_else is having a sale .
M	after 0 separate conversations , and growing frustration they eventually delivered the missing parts thursday .
F	if i dared to do that it '_s due their complete specifications about their machines ( you even have videos ). and also all things are very clear ( delivery , price etc .).
F	what a time saver :_d
F	it just so happens it '_s the higher value items seem to be missing .
M	.
F	its an appaulling service to start with , and the after care and customer service is even worse !
F	it does go amber with time and exposure to light and is meant to be still effective . but i have received very dark ambered serums from other_companies i have bought from in the past which has put me off from using them again .
M	and it is for this reason this service does not receive 0_stars and it could so easily have done .
F	an_apology bouquet was sent to the recipient .
F	i have looked through the manual - looks very complicated .
F	to summarise , a mostly negative experience .
M	they expected them in the middle of january .
M	it took the gloss off an otherwise good service .
F	after arriving home from work i checked to see status of my order via_amazon then was shocked to read that yodel had delivered my item today to porch ??
F	the order took over six_weeks to arrive after they had taken my money .
F	good value and quick delivery .
F	would have been better to know that you use a ' signature_required ' mail delivery before the order is placed ( apologies if i missed that !).
F	i needed some more information on our meet and greet_parking and an_email was sent back to me with all the info i needed within the hour ( and that was on a sunday_evening after 0pm ).
M	i had the option of a purchase from ebay or from an established company .
M	they '_ve been out 0 times over the last 00 weeks in winstone , glos to install a phone / internet line .
M	many_thanks
F	their customer service line is free for three customers , if you want to spend a long time on the phone explaining to them why having your phone fixed right away is important as part of the customer service then do sign up with three !
M	from that alone anyone with any education would be able to deduce was something not to be playing rugby with .
F	the box was sodden , wet through but my boots were ok . rubbersole have said they will give me a 00_% refund so thank_you
M	this has caused me so much stress and is still not yet resolved , two_weeks after i requested the return .
M	we lost the diamond after just 0_weeks and thank our lucky stars as we found it .
M	i asked for a delivery to another address but paid by paypal but nothing warned me that this would mean it was sent to my home address and the one i had asked for would be ignored .
M	had to use my card instead which was disappointing .
M	two prepaid cards , neither worked , cannot get any reply from seller .
F	it all turned_out well .
M	whilst paying for a flight for my dad to return to spain , this seemed to be the cheapest one way deal but turned_out to be anything but the cheapest .
M	during friday we received an_apology for not getting back on thursday and told that a senior technician would be with us between noon and 0pm this thursday to finish installation and rectify issues .
F	however he did tell me that as this was an online account it was my responsibility to check to see if a reading was required !
M	very disappointing first time experience .
F	my biggest worry when delivery takes a long time is the condition the chocolates are in when they arive as i do intend these to be a gift , hopefully , all will be well .
M	need a special present for a 00th b ' day and hendicks gin have a gift pack , so oredered it and it arrived the next_day , all very happy !
M	the shop wouldn_'_t release it to the website guys .
F	it was despatched very promptly .
M	!
F	quick delivery , i was kept_updated with progress of my order .
F	still_waiting .
M	i was looking for cricket_helmet spare_parts and struggling , but not only did barrington have them , they were the cheapest !
F	great search_engine !
M	all they did was cancel my order with them .
M	contacting bt to report a fault is next to impossible and call_centre staff , although polite enough , are no help at all .
F	fast , easy , reliable service .
F	bought costume paid £ 0 . 00 for speedy delivery £_00 . 00 all paid in full on 00th_october_0000 still no costume to this day and escapade are ignoring there phones and have not responded to emails .
M	wasn_'_t chasing the order but some 0 days after i received an email asking about there service i emailed them saying hard to review when order has not arrived .
M	a great firm to deal with .
M	she said nothing and walked_away .
M	however over the last 0 - 0 months the reception has got to be more patchy , giving them 0 last chance as i have just taken out a new contract , then i may have to reconsider my options despite the excellent packages offered by this company .
M	i am really pleased with my vehicle .
F	yes i was very angry and made sure they new it .
M	but it had pull - cord start .
F	because the didn_'_t get an answer they left the flowers at the back of the house which was worrying for me because the lady does not go out to the back of her house .
F	i am pleased with the overall quality too .
F	having made my order on monday i was very upset when on tuesday i went into the order to add another item to find that 0 items were now highlighted as ' not available '.
F	is that why they want us to call and clarify , so they can leave us on hold and charge bsurd rates ?
F	i visited canada and my unit on wednesday , 00 february_0000 and questioned my bill as this increased by 00_% without notice .
F	there were also some large spools of thread for the overlocker included which i was not expecting .
M	i don_'_t normally like recommending friends to suppliers just in case of bad service .
M	however this is not the problem .
M	in addition the delivery was quick and free so one happy customer here
M	really personable .
M	i am totally confused as to why i have actually been declined by cpw / o0 and quite_frankly am discusted with the service i have received from them .
F	picked my delivery slot to suit my arrangements .
M	purchased a blu_ray on 00 october .
M	dfs was excellent and i would recommend hem as they went that extra_mile to ensure that we got the right item for us .
F	good price .
F	which i guess would be fine in most_cases , but in our case they couldn_'_t type the special character in the middle of my name .
M	on the 00th_june i call and actually speak to the md , who seems like a very nice man , who_apologised for the delay in the delivery , and that they would definitely be with me within 00_hours , by saturday .
M	despite the bracing it is still wibbly wobbly .
M	the flowers were not delivered on the day or on the following_day .
M	i haven_'_t smoked a cigarette_since it arrived and the experience of using the e_- go is very pleasurable , far more than i would have expected .
F	i made several calls and sent several emails .
M	good for some products but found some items were cheaper in high_street_shops after buying at what claimed to be hugely_discounted prices !
F	the web_site was easy and intuitive to use .
M	order placed at 0pm . delivered nearly 0pm .
M	i received an email in the morning informing_me when it would arrive -- and it was on time - but being the middle of the day i just couldn_'_t go to work .
F	the plaque received such high accolades from my very fastidious husband , it has remained indoors at present , and hasn_'_t quite made it to its allocated spot , and all our visitors have stroked it , held it , commented on how perfect it is , and all that from i think 0 lovely chats and an e_mail .
F	delivery guys were first_class .
F	i have to say i had a horrendous_experience using viagogo and will never use them again .
F	brilliant , fast service .
M	perfect service .
F	i have purchased supplements from several different suppliers in the past but none compare with simply_supplements .
M	turned_out not to be in stock . the advised 0_weeks turned into 0_weeks . then 0_weeks - we only found out by calling to check each time - so we had 0 call at the start and 0 right at the end , but nothing to keep us posted as the delivery date kept slipping - poor after sales service
M	ordered on friday , delivered on saturday .
M	i would rate this supplier most highly !
M	all in all , i '_m very happy with my purchase from them .
F	you '_d think my husband would be apoplectic by this point .
M	i would recommend shopping from wineware to anyone who_wants high_quality goods at low_prices .
F	ive got to be honest i was dubious_about using these phone company but im_glad to say im plesently suprised excellent service very quick to send the cheque would deffinatly reccomend .
M	haven_'_t put my winter_tyres to the test yet .
F	i was only assisted once from
M	most of my shopping is done on e / bay and the discount 0 %_off your next purchase !
F	so a good value for money .
F	was told it would be painless , that they would do all the work .
M	!
M	immediately after payment , realised there was a one - character mistake in my surname .
M	it passed with no sign of the chairs .
F	we ordered on a friday and paid the extra for next_day delivery however on the monday i still had not received them and called litecraft to find out where they were .
F	really quick delivery , fast responce when emailing question .
F	will use again .
M	it is a dissapointing that i have been laboured with a postage charge that i believe should be refunded as it is not my fault the product failed and should not be held_responsible for delivery charge .
M	well pleased
M	i can '_t fault the glasses , they seem to be well made and the prescription spot on .
F	i would expect much_faster delivery for ordering online .
F	ive not had a problem with pharmacy0u before now , but on this occasion i ordered some important goods which were shown as available yet i have had an_email from the company saying that they are awaiting stock .
F	i never received a reply from them .
F	thank_you !
F	order delivered on time , goods as_described .
M	i was then told that the items were delayed and that they would not be delivered as expected on the 00nd_june .
M	i booked online for the monday as i had no plans only to be called two_days_later and told they had no fitters available as they gave them 0 days off for a 0 day bank_holiday i asked why the date was avail and they said the date was available for the uk and not location based offered me 00 quid to say sorry which still_haven_'_t received will not be using again
M	by the time they turned_up it was too warm to make good use of the fleeces
F	i received the wrong charm with aother customers purchase details enclosed and i presume that customer got mine .
F	i received an e_mail on the day it was due to be delivered to say the courier couldn_'_t deliver and it would come the following_day , as it was heavy and they needed a different vehicle .
M	subtract a further two hours at the depot for sorting and scanning the stock , loading the van , printing out the paperwork and completing van checks and daily / weekly / monthly company sheets and you '_ve only four actual hours to deliver or collect at around 00 locations , thats if you can average driving speeds of 00mph of course ( which you can '_t because of the vehicle limiter @ 00mph ).
M	been out for delivery since monday 00 st oct ( i '_m still_waiting ) i '_ve been on the phone 0 times with more promises of it will be out again tomorrow for delivery !!!!
F	als_je niet teveel geld kwijt wilt dan is dit een goede optie , waar je toch jaren plezier van kan hebben
M	they were good quality with all the fixings , including bolt through screws and fitting_instructions .
F	all seemed well as i selected the free card and wrote my message , money then taken but i noticed they had charged me for a £ 0 . 00 card that i didn_'_t order .
M	would i buy another vehicle from jennings_ford ?
M	i had a dispute that ran for months regarding someone_who bought something from me then mistakenly charged back when they didn_'_t recognise the purchase on their credit_card statement .
F	total_cost for 0 prawns and 0 steaks and 0 drinks came to 000 . 00 euro !!
F	the thing wit liberty_flights is speed . they are so quick and don_'_t charge too much for postage . i likt the xo supreme too , it give good hit and a nicotine supply whilst tasting good .
M	ordering was easy adn delivery was prompt .
F	as the day drew nearer , it became_clear that the order was not going to arrive .
M	problem_solved - what a good service !
F	however a day later i was then informed that they were no_longer doing this and had to review my photos with the manager , they refused to refund unless they took all the items back and then decided if to refund .
M	i thought they were very good at communicating the status of the delivery .
F	easy to do the ordering , i like how you get notified of delivery and kept up to speed , however , the delivery wasn_'_t great . sent some to my mum and the box was literally chucked over her fence into back garden . and my friend didn_'_t receive hers till gone 0pm which i thought was far too late , no wouldn_'_t appreciate someone knocking on my door at that time , kids in bed etc .
M	from speaking to someone on web chat about the memory i required to turning my request into an order .
M	as i was not in a hurry and it was a newly_released item i was happy to wait .
F	i was then sent an_email that said i had put in a new order for the tablets and would be charged accordingly ( again a second time ).
M	if they are that concerned_about the furniture needing waxed i think a bottle should be priced in to the furniture .
F	after hours of fruitless calls and e_-_mails i went to their depot .
M	they replied by telling_me that i cannot cancel !!
M	i turned_up out of the blue with a set of new alloys needing 0 new tyres and i got a great deal - i was really looked after by the staff at kwik - fit on spring bank , hull namely lewis and scott .
F	luckily all items were still inside and nothing had been damaged .
M	the towing electrical upgrade supplied for my 0000 vw_passat is of the highest_quality .
M	if you don_’_t use the internet for anything more than web browsing then one of the cheaper packages would perhaps be suited for you .
F	we waited a while and then decided that the awful parking distance from the airport and general disorganisation was not good enough .
M	not my best experience and will not be top of my list next time .
M	what does ' stock allocated ' mean ?
M	i bought a sidelight bulb_holder , weighing about an_ounce in old currency , or about 00 gramms . it arrived in a simple jiffy_bag , for which i was charged £ 0 postage .
M	when we moved and received the talktalk box i realised i had been swindled .
F	thanks cosmetics now !!!
F	i have ordered a lot of my wedding extras from this website , they cater for every_eventuality .
M	once dispatched delivery was quick and the product was well_packed .
M	but if other_companies offer significantly more i might risk sending my expensive phone to some random company and cross my fingers that they don_'_t just steal it .
M	vervolgens heb_ik de_klantenservice gebeld die mij de boodschap meegaf ' soms is er_een storing bij betalingen via ideal en dan duurt het een_dag '.
F	goods arrived very promptly .
M	it '_s easy to enrol and order .
M	excellent !
M	go - electrical made the process more personal and friendly .
M	however the time taken in initially completing the paperwork was long_winded , although the staff were pleasant .
M	having ordered a lovely - looking bunch of roses and lilies for my sister '_s 00th_birthday , i had expected that i would be able to add a second gift , a pot of bromeliads , in a straight - forward way .
M	the lense on my nikon_d000 performed well , at time i also added my nikon 0 . 0tc which gave_me 000 at f0 .
F	i was really impressed .
F	she shoes themselves are okay - a little bashed but they ' re acceptable !
F	some nitrite - free beef_jerky would definitely make me a customer for life :)
M	amazing topcashback everyone should be using this service thanks
F	i have rated this one star because i have to , not because i wanted to .
M	some other_companies offer higher prices then give you lower amounts , but they paid exactly stated and £_00 . 00 for a destroyed bb torch was amazing thank_you pleasure !
M	however , that being said , the whole purchase to delivery experience was excellent !!
F	there was no_pressure on me to accept any of the deals .
F	contact with the villa_plus staff was very easy , and it was soon sorted_out .
M	now all is well and i am pleased with the result .
F	i would recommend serenata to anyone
M	ordered ipad charging stand and received email update the following_day saying that it had been dispatched .
F	because i was having to leave a key out for the new cleaner , i was a bit_concerned_about the security side of things - would i have any comeback if i got home from work to find that the house had been cleared out and not cleaned ?
M	this feature needs to be specifically explained to users , together with an explanation of what the aic is supposed to do .
F	i didn_'_t like the material of two of the dresses .
F	i have already_recommended this company to others and will_continue to do so !
F	return collection of car was also long_winded , will probably try another firm next journey .
F	i would certainly use this firm again -- if they don_'_t pester me too much meanwhile as some firms seem to do !
M	seemingly parcelforce expect people to collect parcels from their depot which in my case is about 0 0 / 0 hour journey ( one way ) - if you have means to get there .
M	i will_certainly be using them again .
M	i placed an order for new customer super lean pack and ordered 00 packs of protein_crisps as on special_offer for 0 pounds instead of 00 .
M	it is now late september and multiple stalling emails from vd reveal they have lost my glasses in hong_kong .
M	they arrived within days without_delay and once fitted and oiled they look better_than any of the others ive bought before !
M	pourquoi piscine - center n ' a pas repondu a mon demande sur ligne ?
F	a one of a kind website with really reasonable_prices .
F	despite sending a second email requesting some response i have still not heard from them .
F	would definitely recommend this company for quality , value for money and service .
F	this is a really fast & trustworthy service !
F	would definitely recommend .
F	the company was for some time after still operating , as the website was still active .
M	shame you have to shout about your bad_experience on here before they take things seriously .
M	within a couple of hours fonesunlock sent the code to me and it worked with no_problems .
F	xln then hammered me with lots of charges saying i hadn_'_t paid my bill as the bank has to cancel the whole payment .
F	on board they will charge you for everything .
F	should have left an update sooner , finally did receive a full_refund .
F	service very fast , communication excellent , good range of frames , but . when i first received my glasses , the arms were obviously faulty - they flared outwards at an alarming angle , making the glasses far too wide for any normal human head , including mine .
F	i then tried to discover how much the cost of adding baggage would be and am still in the dark .
M	very plesed with the speed of the early part of the process and i hope the rest of the claim goes as quickly .
F	0nd week of march comes and goes . no ladders .
F	furniture ok , but the process of delivery needs review to ensure customer messages are taken_seriously .
F	went ok .
M	had to query charges made by hire co as there was an initial overcharge for rental .
M	when you book , you don_'_t clear_instructions of what happens when you get there .
F	dårlig kundeservice når varen skal sendes retur og påstand om ikke modtaget varer retur .
F	ended_up having to collect from depot so seriously out if pocket !
F	brilliant service very prompt deliver item as describe very happy thank_you
M	ordered friday before 00 . 00 , it came the next_morning .
M	free delivery / half price product / prompt next_day delivery / i would recommend using total_computing without having to try any other company dealing_with computing purchases .
F	delighted with table and sideboard . beautifully made lovely wood . service was excellent . before and after delivery . very polite and helpful staff . i have been recommending to family and friends . anyone that has visited has_commented on the quality and the beauty of the furniture .
M	we use them quite regularly on trips from palma_airport to port andratx and , historically , the overall experience has_been very good , particularly for the price .
M	in all probability i will be going down this route again in the not too_distant_future .
F	the parcel itself would have easily fitted through the letterbox and nothing was ever received .
M	good service , quick delivery , genuine product at reasonable prices .
M	the website was easy to navigate , and i have always opted to collect , although one time i forgot to select that option , the team were very quick to answer my emails and to change the order over to collection and all this to enable collection that afternoon .
M	placed order only to be told that they were out of stock in my size of 0 items .
M	all contacts with first furniture were a disaster , nothing happened as promised in numerous phone_calls
F	received the flowers 00st_may and roses have died before they had a chance to bloom .
M	i missed that soda very much , i '_m quite addicted .
M	because i took a copy of the web_site when it was showing 00 / 0 and now 0 / 0 that now makes the
F	when i made the booking it was a little_unclear as to whether the package would be collected and whether it needed to be dropped_off at a local collection_point .
M	some of their products are lower priced than other_places , but not all the time .
M	crap service x0 , crap eye_test x0 , crap everything . avoid .
F	i was besides myself with worry for the rest of the day with the thought that the tickets were destroyed and wondering how i would break the news to friends who had paid for flights to travel down to london .
M	sometimes their lower priced product combined with the high shipping rate is still cheaper_than the competition , but again , not always , it depends on the product .
M	thanks a million from
M	we use skyparksecure most times that we fly , and will_continue to do so in the future .
M	i ordered my tickets on a saturday_evening .
M	with mypareldelivery . com i selected ups they absolutely first_class .
F	but il keep at it for a few more weeks .
M	the transfer service is very frequent even in off peak hours , i got the coach within five_minutes both_ways .
F	still_waiting for my order
F	so thank_you so much craig and the drum_stop team - you deliver the best customer service ever and you gave matthew such a boost - smiles all around !!
M	i have generally been happy with o0 service , no major issues , they have replaced faulty handsets without issue , but they are let_down by their email / web support , which is outsourced to india and as usual they do not read your emails properly or do not understand and you end up having to repeat yourself several_times only to be told they cannot help you and you need to call support .
F	afterr 0_hr with my voucher and reference_number nobody know about the damn car , so i hire directly from hertz which was excellent .
F	i am sure bedkingdom are a good company , they just need reliable delivery company
F	what happened to the text_messages you usually send
F	i should have known better - still_waiting for the free matress protectors from my previous order 0_months_ago !
F	the flowers were lovely but now do not match
F	from beginning to end the process was quick , easy and hassle_free .
M	victim of their own success ?
M	not the best tbh .
M	telephoned mattress world , who were less_than helpful .
F	reasonably swift shipping .
M	ordered 00 june .
F	there is a microwave for us to use .
M	in a nutshell and much like other reviews i have just read here the flowers received were worse than you can pick_up at a supermarket or petrol_station forecourt , just a whole lot more_expensive , most of the flowers were way past their best and i was very disappointed and slightly_embarrassed .
F	i have not had my order yet .
M	then they sent another email_saying they couldn_'_t send the adapter but give a £ 0 refund if i returned the old adapter ( at whose cost ?)
F	why not make it mandatory ??
F	it is the first time i have sent flowers via the internet .
M	disappointed to have had to remind about refunding my postage and not offered any sort of discount for future orders .
F	i am in no way suggesting that anyone_else uses my personal opinion as a deciding point on whether or not to trust this method of buying and i am in no way intending to slander or cost profit for any business involved in my personal experience . i would like to state however , that £_000 less in my bank_account and no successful deals to date says i personally resent doing so and regret not doing enough research . my conclusion is that i am only in control of spending the money , i have no control on whether a booking is taken or kept .
M	my second order was chucked over my 0th garden_fence with no leaflet through the door to tell me this .
F	but that '_s fine if they think that , so i rejected the offer to get the phone returned to me .
M	also there were 0 leaflets , 0 displaying how to care for the rose , and one about caring for an orchid ???
F	goods turned_up well before estimated deliver date , well_packaged & exactly as_described , disappointed ?
M	why so ?
M	maybe a wee look at the i . t .
M	the service from nationwide was very good and they made sure that everything was perfect for a smooth_transition to leasing .
M	this has_been delivered .
M	we followed the directions we received on the confirmation_email , we were told to go to a certain bay on the car_park were we would be picked_up by a meet and greet service .
M	i spent an_hour on the phone they never even picked_up , what a joke , no reply to my emails
F	they accepted my cancellation & organised the collection of what i cant eat for the next_day with a refund .
F	would much rather have sprung for a delivery charge and had it delivered and unpacked and the packing taken_away ( like dfs or furniture_village ).
F	' customer service ' were rude and unhelpful and my letter of complaint has_gone unanswered .
F	so much_cheaper_than_anywhere_else .
F	the company were a find via an internet_search so we had no personal recommendation .
F	so i emailed their sales_department , and after about an_hour and a half , i asked my husband to phone .
M	they have a big product range and fair prices , but two out of three_times i '_ve_used the site , they have had to ring to say that they don_'_t have stock of an item , despite the site showing stock .
M	rimless turned_out to be weak and easily broken .
F	so i waited and waited .
F	i have to admit the service was great in the sense my order was here in a few_days and the website had great choice and was fun to use , but it was very disappointing , the quality of the costume i had ordered .
M	ordered it , arrived within 00_hours , nicely_packaged , lovely instrument .
M	.
M	they are almost_impossible to contact ( it took me many many hours ) and they have no idea where the goods they claim to have dispatched may be .
M	i would do the same myself .
F	it was in excellent condition , and when i posted it back lenses for hire sent an_email acknowledging its receipt .
M	i called in this week and just wanted a slide but i was greeted and treated exactly the same as when i have spent several hundreds of pounds .
F	my original seat_allocation for these tickets were block 0 row a and seats 0 and 0 .
M	rubish , won_'_t be re - insuring my car with them out of principle and shop there rarely now ( before i spen approx_£_000 a week + £_00_-£_00 on fuel ).
M	far easier then most services at a low price .
F	if you have small children the pool_fence is a must .
F	i found my statement , showed delivery guys but apparently it wasn_'_t enough .
M	chris b ( staffordshire )
F	i had my voucher_code - i ticked redeem .
M	the item didnt arrive until the following_monday at_0000hrs a full 0 days after ordering - hardly next_day is it partmaster ?
M	no recompense for insured / recorded return delivery even_though this had been promised !
F	i would like to know why have l not received 00 per_cent discount when l mentioned this over the phone before the job was done here and my email is being ignored .
M	product looks good and is cheaper_than other_sites but same product works out same price on other_sites once include delivery .
M	they replied immediately , to their credit , to explain the use of parabens and offered a refund etc ,, etc_., otherwise i have been very satisfied with their service .
M	they said they didnt have the right tyre and where waiting for two to arrive by taxi .
F	the flowers delivered were lovely and greatly_appreciated by my friend , however the words i had written which i expected to be typed into your delivery card was blank so she didn_'_t know who they were from .
M	to add to that the personalised card was ripped and torn .
F	well_done .
F	emailed over three_times took a week for a response which basically states some rubbish about high email volumes and the email received showed no interest or_inclination to look into or deal with my query .
M	only had to xfer account .
M	you can '_t ask for more than that .
F	although when enquiring_about what had happened to the phone mazuma were very pleasant .
F	so i was extremely surprised and impressed when i called rubersole , was greeted_by a very helpful young_lady , who told me there would be no problem with returning them - even_though i had worn them for a few_days , and a replacement was available but could take 00 days - due to christmas posting .
M	excellent service , will_definitely use again
M	it needs fixing
M	i would like to add your amazon agents + internet sellers all post this virtually free and you are the major importers of the product , why ?, the postage added 00_% to the cost .
F	reported to customer_services who can ’_t replace faulty machine but have arranged for an engineer to visit mon 00rd_dec to repair rather_than replace brand_new machine .
F	when asked why this was she told me that the order number changes .
M	fonebank offered the best price on my phone .
F	super_fast delivery & free too , just what you want !
M	considering you were kind enough to respond , i thought it was fair to reconsider my review .
M	the website works well enough when dealing_with barcodes but is slow dealing_with clothing and arbitrarily rejects items without stating a reason for rejection .
F	the cat_food has_been easy to order .
F	chocolates were very good quality , very tasty .
F	had to contact 0 times to get my discount_code applied and there was a delay of over week in dispatch as they were out of stock on one item , but only found this out when i contacted them .
M	can these be sent ?
F	i have to say that the wardrobe i bought looks as it was worth twice the money .
M	overall extremely happy
M	never again .
M	porque sera uma propaganda enganosa no site tem a foto do mesmo quando comprei meu fone ( 000 ) 000 0000 0000
F	to say delivery would now be 0 / 00 with reconfirmation on 0 / 00 .
F	so my rating has_gone from 0 to 0 .
M	as instructed by a camerabox rep .
M	you will be the first_port of call in future .
M	delivery is always within two_days even when you order for five days .
M	cost to return too high so i am stuck . not sure if i will order again because of this .
M	since the various changes of ownership , less_than 00_% of the households around here remain connected to the abysmal cable " service ".
F	thank_you
F	despite 0 hours on the phone , they refuse to cancel .
M	software needs to be a little_bit more finite / accurate for the pros that use this service .
M	pricing was competitive including delivery , but it was the positive customer comments that sold me !
F	the lady lyn i spoke to was very friendly and helpful and made me feel at ease .
M	well_done amigo_autos .
F	she laughed at me and told me " jus to wait " and that i have " plenty of time ".
F	the shoes i ordered are great value for money and fit me perfectly .
M	would never use them again no matter what .
F	thought they might re - deliver the next_day , so waited in but did not arrive so i arranged with my son to take me to the depot to pick it up , i do not drive and the depot is 0 bus journeys away from me and it would be too bulky for me to carry , but have no way of knowing if it will be there when i get there .
F	would use again , mainly_because of wide_range but would allow more time if i needed it personalised .
F	0weeks later still_waiting for my refund !!
F	apart_from that the comms were good and and i '_m_glad they use dpd .
M	the prices are very competitive and shipment prices are reasonable .
M	one of the worst companies i have ever_dealt_with , their so called customer service is more like i couldn_'_t care less attitude .
F	thank_you .
F	turns_out they entered my address incorrectly .
M	how on earth is that good service ?
F	would definitely use again .
M	completing paperwork is good ; let '_s hope the chaffeur is there when we arrive .
M	the sign for our new build " dove house " looks great
F	heather
M	mr_memory interceded and helped get my order to me on the 0rd_attempt and my next_day delivery premium was refunded .
F	we ordered the samsung clp 000 colour laser_printer .
F	i was worried that i would not be paid the full_amount as this has happened before when recyling mobile_phones .
F	despite me explaining that surely that wasn_'_t my fault they refused to sell the mirror at the advertised price and i have been forced to contact consumer_direct for advice .
F	however , when i received the sunglasses one of the sides was loose , so i had to put some glue to repair it .
M	!
M	if you need any component . give them a try first . not sure . then ask them . and expect it the next_day . or even the day before . they are damn good . go on . give them a try !
M	thank_you tanja ( and chris )
M	as these were pre_- owned , they had no more stock to replace it .
F	i have been cnecking my bank_statement since and no refund , so today i phoned their sales line number , which would also seem to be customer service as [_name_] answered [_private data ] he said he couldn_'_t help so i asked to speak to the finance_dept .
F	ordered many_times from animed .
M	most_importantly , all_budgets !
M	the delivery people rang when they were 00_minutes away and were very polite and helpful .
M	over a prolonged period trying to get the item repaired or replaced , the staff have been evasive & rude .
M	i would possibly try them again in the future if and when i need a new stove .
M	goodbye ipostparcels r . i . p
F	i
F	first_class products and service .
M	i then demanded to speak to a manager where he then put the phone down .
F	when i ask for his / her name , i do not get it .
F	long_story_short , we had to " miss " our flights and book new ones directly from the airline .
F	this was not clear on the website .
F	will be recommending this company to all .
F	i had hopes as i walked_into a fairly presentable but basic room .
F	was promised on another delivery to follow .
F	we have no record of delivery and we have not recieved the hampers .
F	good prices
M	top tip ditch the usb and supply better batteries !
F	i have organised 0 tutors through first_tutors - very straightforward and safe process to find the right people to tutor my children
M	most goods are good quality and reasonably_priced .
F	emails kept me informed of it '_s progress .
F	the delivery cost at £_00 . 00 was high and so i expected the product to be delivered on the date stated ( next_day delivery , date given was saturday ).
M	as i still_haven_'_t received them after ordering them a week_ago i can '_t yet tell you about my satisfaction of them .
M	i mean i got heroes v might & magic instead of heroes v tribes of the east .
M	thurs .
M	this is not my 0st problem with this company and im hoping it will be my last as i am going to ask that anyone but yodel deliver to me from now on .
F	i telephoned customer_services at 0 . 00 to rearrange as this was inconvenient but never received the promised call back and had to telephone yet again at 0 . 00 to find out what was going on !
F	now im told by the plumber that i shouldnt have to take the whole toilet off the floor and wall in order to tighten the seat .
M	ordered 00 roses at £_00 - they were supposed to be aqua packed for freshness but they werent .
F	not enough thats for sure .
F	however my husband , who had very bad_eyesight , is very happy with the procedure and he has none of the side_effects ( glare , shadows etc ) that i '_m experiencing .
F	we write to complain regarding the above order of bedroom_furniture taken by your designer , john fox on 00th_january .
F	i was also offered a discount as an_apology for the delay , although i '_m not sure how i would get that , and haven_'_t seen any kind of a refund .
M	the customer collections
M	the engineer turned_up to find the room emptied and floor lifted for him , but refused to go under the floor to fix it claiming he had a bad neck and shoulder .
M	having used paypal for a number of years i have always thought the same thing .
M	the windows could not be fitted as the rubbers were too hard and not flexible enough so i sent them back as my cost and expained the situation .
M	they had to re - order the part which did arrive a couple of days_later .
F	i am still_waiting my order . since 00 . 00 . 0000 !!
M	i have just received a new blackberry and had the benefit of a very good deal .
F	my partner and i booked a hotel in glasgow city_centre in october so we could attend the commonwealth games to which we have been allocated tickets .
F	shocking service to say the least but judging_by other comments on this site , prestige_flowers won_'_t be the slightest bit bothered that they spoilt my birthday surprise .
F	to contract cancellation team , or the pay monthly , but no one ever seems to be able to help with a situation .
M	avoid at all costs .
F	it was so well_equipped with everything you could_possibly_need .
F	according to the dfs brentford i was lying and didn_'_t pay when i was telling the truth !!!
F	cathy woodman
F	had to weigh all fruit , veg , measure milk so to be honest i might as well cook my owneals and save my self a fortune .
M	trying out loudspeakers was more enjoyable than i could have hoped .
F	they were given as a memento for a 0 day running event and the logo washes off !
F	ordered dahlias and asters . you had no asters and you decided to supply a substitute , more dahlias . finished up with more dahlias than we required
M	please talk to your dpd driver , gary .
M	i messaged them twice about minor things and they didnt respond .
M	chemistdirect are better_than the rest
F	on return our car has obviously been involved in a minor incident , leading to two alloys being scratched and a type being_ripped apart .
F	when i call europa they say they will investigate and call me back - do they ?
M	a small sachet of grease is included .
M	update .
F	or the mileage .
M	i can only think of a couple times in which i wanted to use it that it actually ran_smoothly without multiple drop - outs or failed utterly by just showing me the vodafone landing page .
M	goods arrived on time and as_described .
M	this company are the most useless set of idiots i have even had the displeasure of dealing_with and i hope to be rid of them asap .
M	!
F	the smeg fridge i ordered took several weeks before it was delivered .
M	without_doubt the worst couriers i '_ve ever had to deal with and that '_s not just one experience sadly !!
M	needless to say , this will be our last order with debenhams !
M	i then found this website with many a 0_star_review on it .
F	i am not sure if it was interparcel or citylink that caused the delay in collecting .
F	this is my second purchase with procook and again another great puchase .
M	again , there are not many of these .
M	another letter sent cancelling .
F	i ordered a steam - generator_iron online .
M	it '_s easier to use the ' site :' operator on google (" keyword " site : amazon . co . uk )
M	competitively_priced products .
F	will never book with them again .
F	this is the second time i '_ve been unfortunate_enough to be on the receiving end of a tnt delivered parcel , and both_times have been equally as disappointing .
F	after complaining some more they apologized and said they would resend or refund me .
F	however , i understand being charged for a change in ferries , but we were charged an admin_fee because we bought a new car after making the booking , so had to change the car details .
F	no_hesitation in recommending this company .
M	what '_s that statistic - one dissatisfied customer tells at_least 00 others ?
M	excellent .
M	buyspares had just the thing - but very expensive ( i think ) - hence only 0_stars .
F	the battery arrived promptly .
M	do these_people realise how depressing living like this is ?
F	then i called them back to cancel both contracts and they made the whole situaition lengthy and started_playing pass the parcel around with me .
M	i love the free uk delivery as well .
F	will definitely use again .
M	this is totally_unacceptable behaviour and i will not tolerate it happening again .
F	in the past i have always been pleased with my purchases until the 0st september when my parents_anniversary card turned_up faulty there was a nasty smear across it . i informed customer_services via_email twice and was ignored twice . on my third email they answered me and promised a replacement , however they emailed me to say they had shipped it along with a picture of the card .
M	first_utility : customer service
M	always a bit of a worry when using a company for the first time for an article that is not on the cheap side .
M	excellent correspondence and service .
F	would highly_recommend
M	how hot do i look now with my new glasses ?!
M	speedy delivery , perfect_condition , best price . recommend using again and again !
M	delivered on tuesday , what more can you ask for
F	good price for car_seat , free delivery and good customer service .
F	their prices are fairly good however , but i wouldn_'_t recommend getting a huge list of things from there - would be better when buying a singular large item if you want convenience .
F	i had to call the company to chase the order and it wasnt till then that they told me the other one was out of stock .
M	why was an order accepted when there was no stock available to allocate ?
F	i ordered my glasses and paid for them through paypal .
M	the advice i was give by the chap at rdk made it all so
M	do your research on the procedure itself and ask yourself the question are you willing to take the risks .
M	thanks iflorist for ruining that for me .
F	oredreing simple and quick .
M	one person got rude with my email after i had emailed about 0 times to see what is happening with my order .
M	seems they have changed courier .
M	would return to them in the future as i appreciate their service and effort .
M	i have since been in contact with metro and genesis who are quite open to discussions about different_types of papers and will consider_using them .
M	steve
M	it '_s superb , was excellent value and was delivered quickly .
F	the service was great , all the phone_calls were answered quickly and the cso '_s were extremely friendly and polite .
M	their issue is that its ok to complain_about the product or their staff as they will do what they can to keep your custom .
M	they were also the cheapest !
F	manager there admits that they accidentally loaded it with amazon returns , but their tracking continued to claim they delivered to be .
M	problem with their new system and issued a new tracking_number and promise of collection , they also gave_me a number to contact parcel0go for a refund .
M	however , we still feel that this was sharp_practice by dfds .
M	the cobra golf_bag , of a particular colour , as seen on their web_site was in stock ( unlike_some other web sites being advertised ) the delivery was delayed by a day but a phone_call to me explaining the reasons was much_appreciated and the bag was delivered 0 days after order .
M	really good service , have used them several_times to order their mixed boxes for beers for parties .
M	i bought some scott 0000 notice otg goggles with castlerock / black chrome lens .
F	on the saturday i had a lovely email from sarah saying she '_d received my bag and had refunded me and sent out my new bag .
F	had to phone them after no response for 0_days and finally gut the info i wanted .
M	what a joke .
M	also , the " free treatment " states on the front it is for decorative purposes .
M	any savings gained are lost and otherwise spoiled aa acceptable experience .
M	!
M	arrived on time .
F	i contacted e_- florist and did receive an initial response stating that they hadn_'_t realised that there had been a problem with the freesias from their supplier and that they had decided to go_ahead and send the bouquet without them .
F	there was no card sent with the flowers so the recipient didn_'_t know who had sent them , despite us completing one prior to ordering the flowers !!!!!!!
F	my sister in law was delighted by the beautiful fresh flowers which were delivered on the day required .
M	!
M	i ordered 0 dining_chairs from macandmac .
F	!
F	!
F	great product .
F	one of the vips had to direct him all the way .
F	today they took over_£_000 from our bank_account for the cancelled order .
F	my husband has couple of medical_conditions and he is over 00 , so i struggle with travel_insurance .

M	the glasses were delivered within a week and were exactly_what we required .
M	first and last time i will use them

F	would definitely recommend flashbay and will use them again for any orders in the future .
M	fast delivery and superb customer_services are standard .
M	their website is festooned with acceditation on service which in my case they didn_'_t live up to .
F	i received excellent service in my recent_purchase of james_wellbeloved puppy_food .
F	have been waiting since august 0th for order costing nearly_£_00 . 00 .
M	fortunately it '_s been resolved , but i felt i had to chase it all the way
M	this concept eliminates the risk of a customer accidentally ordering the wrong tyres by entering incorrect information about size or rating .
M	when are car was returned to us after our holiday in the early hours of the morning , so it was dark , it was covered in cement dust ( it had been parked next to a cement works ) and this made it quite difficult to check it over .
F	i have phone and broadband with talk_talk .

M	still_haven_'_t receive delivery after 0 working_days but the support_team have been very helpful and explained what could have caused delays and the latest i can expect delivery .
M	my first parcel about 0kg and measuring 00cm square was booked in for 00 hr delivery and next_day collection as a tester , the driver arrived , signed for the collection and left me with a collection note , the collection note had a different tracking_number than i was given by the website ?

M	good stuff !
F	the product always_arrives as promised .

M	fitting is made easy with the neat fixing system ,
F	really good quality .
F	good communication , delivery and price .
M	rubbish customer service .
M	not good guys
F	however , i chose to drop_off my parcels at a local collection_point ( petrol_station ) and the lady wasn_'_t very friendly who_served me .
M	as i had recently been travelling to other_countries on business the said returns were just over 00 days .
M	these days , with the internet and rightmove , all you really need from your estate_agent is a " ticket " to post some photos and a description on rightmove ( which you cannot ( could not ?)
F	it was impossible for me to lift the top unit onto the base_unit , and so much packing to dispose of .
F	upon_calling partyrama '_s customer service , although the customer advisor was helpful , she did not apologise for the mistake once .
M	try phoning the mortgage advice line and ask something like ' what '_s 0 + 0 ?".
F	the larger set of lights is brilliant but the one with less bulbs only lights half of them and does not always stay on
M	just off to order more !
F	i also needed to check on gluten , which is shown clearly .
F	not good customer_relations really !
F	i contacted kwik_fit mobile service and a lovely gentlemen came out and sorted_out the recently blown tyre quickly and efficiently , with the correct walnut key !
M	needless to say that is no_longer a tick against your name either so in the future i will use your service if you are offering a similar , or better , price , because i trust you .
F	order number .
M	if you ’ re not happy don_’_t do it .
M	on the day of delivery i was sent a message_saying that the would not deliver to the site i was working at but only to the address that the card is registered to .
M	. not sure if it was me or them but some of the pages were in the wrong order .
M	lindy buying experience was very good .
F	i still have not recieved my perchase its been over a week
F	when i rang querying this i was told that items were not posted due to it being a bank_holiday .
M	my first email to them requesting an estimated dispatch received a general statement relating to problems they were having but they would do their best to dispatch as soon as possible .
M	negative
M	they have delivered all my orders on time and all products have been received in excellent condition .
M	i '_ve bought a few items from bureau_direct and had great service on every occasion .
M	it is fair to say the product in every other respect is excellent , shame about the after sales service with a sneer .
M	altogether an excellent product at a surprisingly reasonable price .
F	after trying all day to get_hold of someone finally they refused to help saying they couldnt offer a refund and if the flowers still didnt turn_up they would resend them .
M	ordered a pair of trainers in january .
M	faultless service
M	just wish they ' d made this info clearer on their site to begin with .
F	being one , but on receipt of my order i was amazed_at the quality of how the meats looked and was very impressed with the packaging . all individual , very well and clearly_labelled to .
M	knee_pads were excellent , flexible and well_designed would buy again .
M	this is the first time i have used bulk_powders , referred from men '_s health .

M	free bee for my 00 year_old_son ?
F	depends what you but and don_'_t expect any thing fast really slow
M	will shop with this company again .
F	i bought a few items .
M	i won_'_t be buying from amazon again till they get_rid .
F	very happy with the service .
M	i am reluctant to purchase more goods from your catalogue online in case i have to return the item at considerable cost to me .
F	well that was a load of s ** t . i rang the customer service number several_times 0_days , 0_days and on the day of the event explaining i was yet to have my tickets !
F	- instead of the four screws required for each hinge - there is only two .
F	the order process was clear and easy to follow .
F	it fits like a glove , although it is a tiny_bit long .
M	the packaging is not robust enough to avoid the corners of the book being damaged and dog - eared .
F	i would definitely recommend to my friends infact i have , the service from direct sight is so helpful especially helen - who deals with emails very quickly .
F	so therefore i may think_twice about ordering online .
F	having phoned the company to express our concerns they did deal with them swiftly .
F	i ordered a rug recieved an_email_stating it had been dispatched and will be with me in 00_hours 0_days_later didn_'_t have it sent an_email to see what had happened was told it was out of stock they were sorry and offered a 00_%_discount after taking 0_days off work unpaid losing a total of £_000 wages this company is a disgrace wouldn_'_t have a rug off them now if they were giving it away
M	they are the only courier company whose driver does not understand that my drive gate slides to the side to open and i have seen it on my cctv_camera where the driver gets out , pushes and pulls violently on my gate and then goes back , writes a card and pushes it into a gap on my gate .
M	and im still_waiting for this issue to be resolved even after 0 emails , and over a month .
F	these aren , t always the cheapest !
M	shame on you o0 .
M	very quickly we were all on the same wavelength and we had a good idea of what we wanted to do and how we were going to do it .
M	would recommend to anyone will be using this company again !
M	they the same problem recurred !
F	never wish to deal with them again and will for sure disregard any company which uses them as their courier !
F	the prepaid_envelope arrived very shortly_afterwards .
F	it is a trust_worthy provider of my vision requirement .
F	!
F	the main ingredient of my husband '_s christmas_present sorted without raising my blood_pressure .
F	they were very apologetic though .
F	i would not recommend them due to this situation and their poor choice of films available instantly .
M	a few_days_later after receiving no response i chased world_stores only to be told that the item was not available ( despite it being still advertised on the website ) and a refund has_been requested .
F	poor quality and not worth the price .
M	by far the best price i could_find .
M	apesar_de a encomenda ter corrido bem e ter sido sempre bem atendido pela mariza da_probikeshop tive alguns problemas com a transportadora , a encomenda extraviou - se e tive de esperar mais de 00 dias que fosse entregue .
F	everything is ok
F	we were looking for a desk and we didn_'_t want anything made from chipboard .
M	cheapest price i could_find for the flea and worming_treatment i needed for my dog .
F	and they would refund 0 - 0_days but pleaze allow 00 days in busy_periods .
M	i thought there were too many terms & conditions in small_print .
M	not worth the good service , really .
F	the ramp itself is fantastic and has made life much simpler .
M	you can beat oakfurnitureland for service .
F	however , the very small_print on our agreement states that charges can be anything between £_000 and £_000 charge for every £ 0000 owed .
F	0 case was sent within 00 days but other 0 took several weeks of communication - and they seem to be sent from within the uk .
F	the site is not well_laid_out , not very user_friendly .
M	from the phone_call we can almost always get a solution .
F	it took over a week to arrive . the item was reduced but thought the p / p was over the top for such a small light item i have now spoken to the company and all is resolved now happy with service
M	the flowers were lovley and arrived the next_morning ( i had only ordered them tea time the night before ) i was pleased with the contact i had when they was being delivered although i was dissapointed as i had paid extra for a bigger bouqet and they were smaller than an average size in my opinion therefore i did not think they were worth the money i had paid although my mum was very pleased with them .
M	received the camcorder , in original sony packaging later that day .
F	so please bbw - make_sure you have enough supplies in the warehouse to meet demand - don_'_t let stocks run_out before ordering more .
M	purchased 0 pairs of zildjian 0a dipped sticks and some other spares for my hardware .
M	yet i get a reasonably good deal and when someone calls me , my phone rings - which is what i want from a mobile provider .
M	once it took about two_weeks and two e_mails before i got the delivery which was " in stock and despatched within 00_hours " apparently .
F	having made my order on the 0th_sept to have it delivered on the 0th i was very disappointed that by the 00th_sept it had not been delivered .
M	i '_ve bought two phones from them .
M	the newer version is a tiny_bit higher_spec but that didnt make a scrap of difference to how easily this worked for the job i needed to do so who needs the latest_version ?
F	this service is appalling and will cause you inconvenience , take up your time , and , depending_on the particular situation , might actually cost you financially .
M	however with mazuma i couldnt find a bad review and sent off my application for my phone to be sent back , amazing turn_around the money was in my bank_account within a few_days , definetley recomend thanks .
F	i have contacted twice about this but not sure if this has_been rectified .
M	i '_ve ordered 0 times through hungryhouse , and 0 times the food has arrived late .
F	very polite and listened to all what i said which was very nice .
F	will use again .
M	customer service is rubbish when they get it wrong , keep telling you different_stories and never give you an update .
F	ordered at_least 00m over a period of a few_weeks .
F	meaning a missed collection takes another two_days unlike_other_companies they won_'_t send out another courier at their expense .
M	they kept me informed via emails of what was happening with my order .
M	there was very little difference in the price , the ordinary model is what we have used before , so there is little point in asking you to change it .
F	flowers were delivered beautifully_presented and very fresh .
F	would consider a different company when buying again !
M	i cannot_believe i fell for it , but after a long period in the hands of gently persuasive sales staff , my guard dropped and i was reeled in .
F	but it came with no instructions or leaflet with basic exercises which was disappointing ( i note that many other_sites all supply this with their product ).
M	outfit snug_fit however good for the job and reasonable quality .
F	plain speaking , caring with no " rip_offs ".
F	there are some barking dogs , and across the street one of the residents locks her dogs outside , and they bark alot until about midnight .
M	the internet ordering_process was easy enough .
M	great web_site fast delivery they keep in touch to let you know when your order is being delivered
F	you can access the policy on the web and print it off there and then straight after paying before going into your email .
F	my only_criticism is that the unit came in two pieces and very well_packed in big boxes and plenty of packing .
M	we upgraded to extra leg_room and it was great value at only £ 0 each .
M	i honestly wish i was never tempted by their cheap tariff .
F	one of them was a bit shocked at the price i had paid .
F	it was easy straight_forward !!!!
M	why_bother , save your money and look_elsewhere .
M	in 00_hours i had my mobile sent and in less_than 00 the money in the bank .
M	the most frustrating aspect is the number if complete time_wasters you get which is demoralising , time_consuming and massively frustrating .
M	its my go to place .
F	when confirming order and paying the postage was reset so that the item would not get to me in time .
M	so if in doubt , ask the questions , their onlne form , when used is excellent .
M	they have managed to remove any civility or enjoyment from flying in my opinion .
M	advised low stock on website .
F	luckily for me however , you have still been able to charge me while providing me with nothing .
F	the ring is beautiful but i think everytime i look at it i '_ll feel that twang of disappointment .
M	well_done shower_doctor !
F	very impressed with service .
M	incorrect they are esfitting and do not come supplied minor_detail realy just have 0 wasted bulbs but hey_ho .
M	yeyyyyy very late but yey anyway .
M	p . a . n . t . s
M	thanks !
M	no_fuss , no bother .
F	every letter , piece of literature , plus all telephone_calls were clear and explicit .
M	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 thank_you .
M	well_done escape !
F	speedy delivery smooth_transaction would highly_recommend physioroom . com
M	and for what it '_s worth , having been a member of simplyheath in a company scheme , when i left that employment i wanted to continue my health care unbroken i found that my loyalty was rewarded by increased premiums far more than joining new from scratch !
F	flowers arrived exactly as ordered , the only_negative_comment i could make was that the roses were past their best .
M	i ordered two t shirts on 00 . 00 . 0000 and have not received them at time of writing this review - 00 . 00 . 0000 .
F	the phone number on the letter and the offer strip is no_longer in use so , not having access to a computer connection , she is unable to contact them and is obviously very upset and worried .
F	the only time they showed some interest in finding out where the tops were was when i wrote to cancel the order 0_months after_placing it , as i had given up any hope of ever seeing them and was starting to suspect that the company was fraudulent .
M	there have been some great companies that have paid cashback quickly and who can argue with getting back £_000 that i might never otherwise have had ?
F	proceed with this case against nice cans , as from the weekend the case as been constructed and i will proceed to court in order to
M	i was on telewest for 00 years and had excellent service but overpriced !
F	good prices , good range of products , no delivery charge .
F	- i was sent totally the wrong products in my second order .
F	i would highly_recommend this site , i have used them many_times over the years and they have never disappointed .
F	i did an order , although assistant did not seem to know what was going on .
M	the layout of their website could be much simpler , the transfer times for payments could be much_quicker ( rather_than sitting on customers money for 0 days to collect the interest on top of the extortinate percentage rate ) and the customer service much_better .
M	sold goods which apparently they didnt have refunded me months later and when sent them damaged shoes they didnt even bother to look at them .
F	but myhermes did not respond at all .
F	the last train from glasgow to ayr leaves at 00pm ( 00 minute journey ).
F	they would not fit and when i looked at bottom of shoe , wrong_size in box .
F	different product .
M	all communication is one way - they never contact to give any sort of update which is just infuriating .
F	this is the only site i visit now .
M	when i tried to return the bat , was asked to send it via_royal_mail recorded delivery ( 00p was offered by millet to cover the recorded delivery label !
F	however they sent the wrong item .
M	i accept that they had a supply problem ( not stated at the time of ordering ), but surely some communication notifying the late despatch would have been helpful .
M	big_mistake .
F	i '_ve ordered over_£_000 of frontline for cats from you , last monday .
M	they are talktalk ( vomit in my mouth ) and orange ( ooo i just felt my sphincter tighten ).
M	00 / 00
F	product just as_described
M	still no dispatch email at 0 :_00pm so phoned again only for another person to tell me it wont be dispatched until tomorrow .
M	they claim they are number 0 , well yes they are if you ignore the other 00 providers above them , what they mean is that they are no 0 of the big six companies with a customer_satisfaction score of just 00 %.
F	help_desk only open mon to fri - 000 - 000 which made it difficult to be able to call .
M	other delivery companies tell me to the minute when they will be at my door and they are accurate .
M	this is not an option on velux_windows so hopefully they are ok . for some items i can appreciate this clause but for some it is not practical .
F	excellent service , product and delivery .
F	still it did not arrive .
F	there '_s standard , next_day , next_day by 00pm and next_day by 00 .
F	it was not a cheap gift £_00 .
M	no service at all really . despite saying no to a 0am delivery in the first instance , told on 0 further occasions that that would be the delivery time .
F	ok so i '_m not that irate but it did say to write a catchy headline !
M	easy to order delivery as stated would certainly use again and recommend
F	there are very few plus sizes available , anyone over a size 00 - 00 is out of luck .
F	00th_dec saturday and the advisor on the phone said my unlock_code will be sent to
F	it '_s a real_shame .
F	i wasn_'_t too sure on the website , so i gave them a call and they give you the option to go pick things up in person .
M	so i asked to speak to his_supervisor - and was told that the supervisor would not speak to me ( this , without having consulted said supervisor ).
M	usually you get a platitude then silence .
M	i expect them to make a profit but the tickets i received were a face value of 00_euros for which i was charged 000_euros each .
M	it '_s a shame .
F	staff were friendly , knowledgable and helpful .
F	i was able to send flowers while on holiday - it was so easy !
M	paul
F	the laptop was collected on the day agreed ( 00rd_december ) but i had to call on 00th_january because i hadn_'_t received my payment ( which according to the website should have been 00_hours from receipt ).
F	see above for more info ;-)
F	of them again .
M	prime examples of this include major sporting_events .
F	highly_recommended .
M	very pleased with the first_class service and great price i will be using you for all my future pet_supplies
M	i once sent my old phone to htc and they repaired it and sent it back to me within a week , this is appalling and they have no excuse for taking so long
F	i ordered on the 00th_december and did not receive my order till the 00st of december even_though the order specified 0 - 0_days .
F	the friend who i sent them to was delighted with them and said they were so unusual and the most amazing electric_blue in colour .
M	:-)
F	the location is too far to walk into playa_blanca although there are shops and restaurants within a 0 min_walk .
F	they didnt even have the decency to ring me on the night to let_me know the dancer wasnt coming and when i tried to ring them they blanked my calls .
F	then . looking at my bank_statements , i have 0 x $ 0 . 00 transactions on the 00 march_0000 by " traveljigsaw ".
M	i was looking for a detachable tow_bar for my wife '_s car .
F	i wanted to get my annuity from a bank to help with gap in finances after having to give up regular job .
M	great product , great price & good service .
F	there needs to be a negative star system put in place .
M	this experience has put me off buying anything here again even_though their prices are very good .
F	excellent product around the house especially windows .
F	however after 00mins plus of asking the same questions in different_ways to try and get some i was still no further forward , apart_from them offering me an_alternative watch which was nothing like i had ordered ( and a mans watch ).
F	!
M	when i bought the two bed side_tables i was told that if it is damaged then they will replace it only to be told we will repair it so i paid full price for damaged goods .
F	i also would also like to be able to track my order so i know what stage its at in the delivery .
M	i will not start on what else happened that day and the next_day incase an executive would look at this review .
F	they received many complimentary_comments .
M	several emails were not replied to .
M	it '_s not worth with the stress and hassle when things go_wrong , and it will go_wrong .
F	have just had my bill and guess_what ?
F	was in two_minds whether to ring up and complain and still_haven_'_t - but this review has allowed me to at_least voice an opinion .
F	we are working on rectifying this ."
F	after booking a double ( see above ) i was told was getting an upgrade to a double ?!
M	cannot_fault it .
F	i found the site easy to get around and i was able to find what i was looking for .
F	had a bad_experience last june / july with kitbag that took around 0 - 0wks to resolve , never used again until before the world_cup .
M	saying that a staff_member would call back in five_minutes i was amazed when it happened in three minutes .
M	it was advertised as being for a pc or laptop .
F	i took the day off and waited all day and the delivery never showed .
M	one of the problems i have which is not unique is a neck size which is large 00 " and a body rather smaller so when i received the dinner shirt i ordered the body was massive but the collar fitted well .
F	the quality of the goods were also of a good standard .
F	i had bought a £_000 set of 0 phones and they had a 0 year_warranty .
M	saw the makita table_saw online at the cheapest price by far .
M	once again i have to say i am in disbelief !
M	the tuxedo that i purchased was a good fit , the trousers were really comfortable , i am very pleased with my purchase and will look to be using the services of this company again in the future .
F	easy website to use and product arrived the next_day which was great .
F	other than this the body warmers are all good so far .
M	i chose parcelhero to arrange carriage of these items since knives do not appear in its prohibited items list .
F	on my first phone_call ( 0_days after ordering ) i was told the item would be sent out that day .
F	i '_ve already emailed about this and received a phone_call and assurance from you so the issue has_been resolved but the courier you use was not great !
F	ordered the saturday , said would be dispatched the tuesday .
M	and i had an instant deflate .
M	i haven_'_t had to return anything , or contact customer_services with any query , but i have a feeling that i would be satisfied with those services , given the professional service i have received thus_far .
F	i waited over six_weeks for my order which never arrived .
F	other than that it looked great .
M	from the selection of packages we chose the one for us .
M	so angry .
M	the system is quick , although windows 0 . 0 is a nightmare to use and i '_m pretty fluent in most windows os .
M	0000 00 00 update ,
F	subsequent delivery arranged did not appear so wasted day off work .
M	i was given a new estimated delivery date at that time but i was then informed ( in good time ) that it was still not available from the distributors .
M	i go past a lot of cyclists on their mega price bikes with clothing costing more than my bike , but they cant keep_up with me maybe their wallets are to heavy !
M	it '_s really good value as well - much_better_than the other nearby rooms .
M	when i took the bike back , the service department rectified the problem straight_away , but the service was more hostile than friendly .
M	try to use a direct / root registrar if at all possible .
M	the lady i spoke to was very helpful and polite and the order arrived the next_day .
M	tickets for the european outdoor film tour on 00th_nov at the rgs are £_00 at the door or £_00 in advance .
F	the most disappointing part was that the delivery - we arrived home to find a scrawled message on a scrappy piece of paper pushed through letterbox simply saying ' in garden '.
F	i phoned go - electrical .
M	i searched the internet for the best price for the product i required .
F	consistently ignoring the information provided in the phone_calls and emails , like the fact that our outbound_journey dates had been changed .
F	it is two_weeks_later i am still_waiting :(
M	i would recommend strings_direct highly to anyone - in fact only yesterday i recommended them to a fellow guitarist .
M	just didn_'_t bother turning_up with my flowers on mother '_s day .
M	finally we also nearly drove_away in an unsafe car .
M	we ordered a three door wardrobe and it wouldn_'_t fit up our stairs .
M	this shuttle driver asked us to take the car keys with us and after checking our car for existing damage on a pre_- printed chart , we were asked to sign it but we weren_'_t given a copy .
F	really pleased !
F	the bottom and right hand edges show a white tapering margin which should not be there at all .
M	what is annoying however is that you can '_t use gift cards on - line - when i called customer_services up ( as i couldn_'_t believe this ), they told me they were trying to make this feature available .
M	never had a problem and the items arrived always withing a couple of days !
F	lyndsey ( who i commend as she has always been helpful and informative ) explained it is normal for price increases however i was not notified .
M	purchased goods and was told 0 - 0 days delivery .
F	cheapest price on market , and gold_star bonus that items were stored securely and delivered on my specified delivery date when my kitchen was scheduled to be fitted which saved me lots of stress !
M	i think we received a £ 0 voucher as compensation for our empty tums .
F	!,
F	worth getting .
F	i ordered these units as they had baskets instead of just shelves and they are great .
M	experience with rentalcars absolutely fine .
M	i contacted many properties with sunny rentals .
M	good service prompt and efficient , was disappointed that my phone was found to be " not working " owing to wear and tear on the menu button ( iphone ).
M	this is supposed to be a budget_airline but i see no value for money
F	they made a mistake to be condescending to us as i shall_continue to point out the truth : tesco thing that they are the big cheese but their bad customer service already made them to forget to go into the french market and they had to quit the us market : i wonder_why . not .
F	had a faulty car from there took them 0_days to take the car in and fix but they did fix it eventually . beware and always check the car your thinking of buying
M	i have now been reimbursed my rental fee but i have asked why this happened in the first place and what guarantee can i get that it won_'_t happen again .
M	.
M	if your service was rubbish , then i would have kicked you up the bum !
F	they were also very helpful .
M	delighted !
M	i had my service from sky but apparently the previous tenant was with talktalk and the line that we thought was sky , in fact was talktalk .
F	tcb is ok , but its tracking is hit and miss , and when you put in a claim , you may as well kiss goodbye to hearing about that ever again .
M	wiggle offer a great range of products in a wide_range of sizes , and also make the returning of any items your not happy with a really easy process .
M	can '_t fault merlin_cycles , their prices were very good ( especially since i was buying sale items ) the items arrived very quickly even_though i ' d gone for budget delivery .
F	when i got in touch with groupon to appeal for an_extension or get a refund due to the misleading_information on the voucher , it was clear from their response they hadn_'_t read or understood any of my message as all they did was say to me i had to get a mobile code - regardless of the fact this would then have been invalid anyway .
F	very helpful staff and quick delivery .
F	however , i only liked 0 of the 0 products i ordered , so the beef_casserole and the beef meatballs went into the bin .
F	that is until cost a lot decieds to take there cafe over .
M	they don_'_t inform you that you have to buy insurance from budget car even if you buy from them so effectively i double bought insurace .
M	on balance for a rural_area 0meg speed aint bad .
F	!

M	i will not recommend you to anyone .
F	flowers arrived as ordered .
M	on the day my new orange phone was due to be delivered , i get a phone from e0 !!!
F	which year are they actually intending to pay the debt they owe me ?
F	i '_m very impressed with this company - i phoned them and they were polite , helpful and i " was the only customer in the world " attitude .
F	hi
M	you won_'_t be disappointed !
F	a single folder with very basic information and a lot of repetition .
F	can not recommend this company due to poor customer service .
F	part of it arrived the next_morning ( on a saturday - i thought you didn_'_t deliver on saturdays ?)
F	ordered part for my shower and it was delivered within a couple of days .
M	i suppose stuff happens and i '_ll give them another shot when i need a refill of my purchase , however two strikes and i '_ll move on .
F	there is no way to feed_back this issue to edinburgh_airport .
M	the buggers were eating the bait without setting off the trap .
M	why would i ?
M	packaged securely .
M	the assembly was quite difficult .
M	can you believe that .
F	this is my 0rd maclaren xlr !
F	!
F	i couldn_'_t fault the delivery .
M	the range of products has always been good compared to other supermarkets . average fruit and vegetable section not as good as morrisons . very good wine section .
F	we had no response to this so i rang giving my colour choice .
M	this is blatant theft .
F	they are a bit small , quite tasty but leaving an after - taste which isnt so good , it hangs on . & despite adding veg and fruit which i eat anyway it leaves me feeling hungry . very hungry .
F	the transaction was very smooth and i would not_hesitate in purchasiing from this company again .
F	no outfit for my birthday / halloween_party , very disappointed :(
M	superb all_round service , as always .
F	i paid £_00 for a parcel to be delivered to eire - the [_external_reference_] ireland driver got to a town 0 miles from the destination and asked if anyone knew the village my parcel was addressed to .
F	fantastic service & great on price .
M	each item was well boxed and protected .
F	uninspiring card ; could have been prettier .
M	fast service , disappointing website .
F	do not use this company !!
M	living in cornwall means often we have to rely_on online purchasing .
M	excellent shopping_experience , great prices , lovely style clothes , superfast despatch too , well_done boohoo . cheers shaun .
F	hope this helps x
M	reasonable prices .
F	thank_you !
F	after_placing an order online , a salesperson telephones me and confirms all_aspects of the order which doubles my time and involvement !
M	arrived day after order placed and product is as stated .
F	i love play . com
M	i bought two beanbags for my two grand_daughters who naturally didn_'_t want to have the same patterns .
F	no_doubt will be using you again ( and recommending to others ) especially after i just tried one of the excellent quality delicious milk_chocolate_cigarellos !
M	diffusers sourced easily from website , cost less_than £ 0 each instead of £_00 for complete jet , brilliant !.
M	first , the ticket never arrived as it was lost in transit !
M	what i '_m not clear about this car_hire episode is that the original total ( including excess_waiver_insurance ) quotation was €_000 , which was completely paid by december 0th ., and then my creit card is debited €_000 on at car pick - up .!
M	00 months_ago i ordered a dewalt table_saw with pay0later with no_problems .
F	well , i phoned the organiser and they have no record of my booking and if i just turn_up - i won_'_t get in !
M	very prompt delivery and excellent product .
M	flowers are sent in a box so ignore comments regarding broken_stems .
M	i would have much rather paid £_00 for a guy in a dodgy repair shop to fix it .
F	bought an item and used credit_card to pay , seller failed to deliver .
F	however , as paying customers , the onus is on them , i would say , to let the customer know if this is to be exceeded ?
F	have placed 0 orders and low postage but been delivered very promptly .
F	my only other option would have been to book a ticket for £_00 , thus paying the £_00 difference as well as a £_00 changing fee .
F	as it is the original call_handler let you down .
M	i ordered a pair of shoes which were on sale at a very good price .
M	should have come here first , would have saved me wasted trips to 0 b_& q branches .
M	great company to deal with .
M	started to see a difference after a couple of weeks .
F	arrived promptly .
F	absolutley fantastic , no point buying any other straighteners they will be second rate !!!
M	i wanted to get something special for two of my best friends 00th birthdays .
M	it was taking over 0 minutes to load the next page throughout the ordering_process .
F	easy to use site , full of information .
M	as it said , very swift , very cheeps and comes packed with a nice choccy . always friendly and polite . good company to buy from .
F	the bouquet my friend received has no orange at all - it '_s very dark in colour , with three dark_red_roses , about six red chrysanthemums , and some white_lilies .
M	it has never been damaged or in water .
F	i ordered my decorations on friday_afternoon and they arrived monday_lunchtime .
F	the service provided was quick and the colours of the flowers where nice .
F	however , the goods themselves were a little_disappointing and this would prevent me from using this service again .
M	note
M	i enquired as to why it was ' part - despatched ' and why had i not been notified about this at the time of order , to which they had no answer - apparently i can expect the balance in around a week !
F	quality of the flowers was good but the flowers weren_'_t delivered to our front_door as we live above a church they were left_outside the church doors rather_than to us even_though we did state that they were for the flat .
F	after a long wait trying to get through to customer_services , they advised me that the lady_named kennedy had gone home now and she was working her way through the various e_mails and mine hadn_’_t got to the top !
F	i have contacted the consumer advice helpline and they have informed me that i do not have to pay this £_00 charge for 0 reasons ; .
F	it cost me nearly_£ 0 , to send it first_class recorded .
M	the postal_costs were very reasonable , and the package arrived in just a couple of days .
F	there was a table_tennis_table as advertised but it was jammed in to a small space with no room to hit anything other than perhaps your elbows !
F	i '_ve ordered quite a few items from here and the prices , delivery have been remarkable .
M	errrrm no !
M	i have had issues with data reporting .
M	thanks
F	in the end we rang customer_services for advice .
M	the service from this company is absolutely_appalling .
F	so all we get are positive_reviews which is as good as worthless
F	we are now at 00th_may and despite_emailing and phoning them i have yet to receive the delivery of the stag bars .

M	i received confirmation_email and the details about itinerary only after two_days .
F	mario_costume for my 0year_old_son .
F	i had a very bad_experience with iflorist and will never use them again .
M	i returned it with a full_tank so budget did rather well in that respect .
F	they would not publish it untill there customer service team have spoken to me .
M	but then a few weeks_later i received a bill for about £_000 . 00 from talktalk .
F	this company lost my order but didn_'_t realise they had lost it until i asked where my goods were .
F	when i bought it i thought the whole_thing would come , hat , dress , boots etc cause thy all tied in together .
M	oh and the prices are good too !
M	web_site easy to use but service from national_tyres in inverness hopeless phoned day prior to fitting to confirm time as needed to book mot at halfords 000_yards down the road from national site i was given a time 00 : 00 & told fitting & tracking it would take about an_hour to carry out .
M	not impressed
F	thank_you so much for a trouble free service !
M	avoid this company like the plague . h
M	well not by me or to me it wasnt after a few emails and some form repsonses , i called them direct was told it had been sent by hermes , ( see reviews ) who are just a joke , the signature was ilegible i was told and no printed surname availble good eh !!.
F	the mattress i chose was a special order and i was told it would take 00 days .
F	offered further surgery once dryness is better , but i don_'_t really want to have it done as i am scared it will get worse .
F	0rd lie .
F	heather was extremely_helpful and found some very good flights and offered what i found to be a very good price for a package of 00 flights including transatlantic flights .
M	the internet site was easy to understand and uncomplicated , the transaction was dealt_with quickly and efficiently , the postage information and packaging arrive within 0 days , this was returned following the simple instructions , and the money was paid into my bank 0 days_later , all in all a very easy and well managed way of doing busines , would recomend to anyone , thanks
M	call plans are ok if your a home customer , choice of phones is average but worst of all is customer_services - it '_s ridiculous trying to sort a problem , get answers etc .
F	it didn_'_t arrive on the wednesday , so i sent an_email when i got home from work to see if my item had been despatched - as promised in the email_confirming my order .
M	very pleased with product and price .
M	further problems : requested email confirmation of order cancellation , but never received any , and no sign of refund .
M	ordered an expensive tent and matching footprint .
F	curry '_s were to pay for it but i had to order and pay and then claim money back , unfortunately no invoice with the goods and curry '_s will not re - imburse me without one .
F	the service and food was very good and this managed to cheer me up .
M	arrived late , left for early flight in the morning , there only for 0 hours , great room , great bathroom but on my stay the electric sensor did not work , offered a room change but as needed to sleep simply used shower instead .
M	although i '_ve_used animed before , the last two orders have been stuffed_into an envelope and we all know that hm royal_mail don_'_t treat packages kindly .
F	i found the application_form easy to use and when i did have a medical query , contacted the helpline number and was reassured immediately by a person , not an_automated service , which was great .
M	also when checking out they then offered me another £ 0 discount on what was already a very cheap price .
M	i '_m really happy with my purchase , these headphones are really great .
M	i discover that in his panic to dispatch this payment to the organisation he forgot to include the
F	i asked for an_email to be sent to me confirming that the order had been cancelled and to date nothing has ever came through .
M	placed order on monday_afternoon ; arrived by 0am the next_day . quicker_than going to the shops !
F	the one o ring missing was the one needed by the plumber which seals off the flow of the water when turning the shower off .
F	i bought my pc from here after shopping around and this was the cheapest and was able to customise to my own specs delivery was very fast as they build to specs packaging ace and no damage highly recommnend
F	the same size trampoline could easily have cost £_000 more on some websites .
M	make_sure you are on the electoral register if you plan on hiring a car .
M	it fitted my samsung_galaxy_s0 perfectly .
F	after_placing my order i had a couple of queries so i e_- mailed serenata_flowers .
F	her previous remote had huge buttons but lots of them and she kept pressing the wrong buttons which_meant the tv has to be retuned .
F	this morning ( 00th_april ) i got a call from a mopp employee who was obviously absent the day they taught customer service , to say that he was having_difficulty_getting me a cleaner .
M	they sent the wrong_colour and size of pumps .
M	sent it back with a explanation .
F	it is also cheaper_than hostelworld .
F	truthfully , don_'_t gamble with this firm -- i wish i hadn_'_t .
M	overall i would try them again if i was looking to rent again .
F	0_weeks_later i enquired as to the whereabouts of our order as the website still listed it as waiting for stock .
F	did so , but no return call almost a week_later - have now missed the offer i wanted .
M	both watches i have purchased are in ' brand_new ' condition despite both being in excess of ten_years old .
F	great chioce , good advice

F	in my opinion this company are a joke .
F	tried_calling the contact # and it won_'_t go through from the us .
F	i ordered two large items in october_0000 and both have failed .
F	i spent 00_mins trying to get through a language_barrier to get the person to understand my dilemma .
M	also , the machine seemed to work ok after a brief test .
F	like many others i ordered items early_december for delivery before xmas .
F	thanks !!
F	i still have not received an_email asking for my bank details , and the money has not been transferred .
F	it may even incur a phone_call as i like to be prepared for a trip and this defeats the object of booking online .
F	very good product , stylish and sleek to operate .
M	best supplement company by far .
M	no response - mailed again the next_day copying in info_@ - again no response .
M	was told a different a figure that i would be getting then told it would be less , not happy at all not really dealt_with professionally not offered any form of compensation just stated its a training issue not really good enough considering how much money they make as a company
F	unfortunately a couple of the stems of the stocks were broken and as you can_imagine this brought disappointment to the birthday_girl .
M	excellent service ordered monday received tuesday_morning .
F	another example : i ordered 0 polo_shirts at £_00 each and when they arrived there was a leaflet_enclosed advertising 0 polo_shirts for £_00 ( about half price ).
M	batteries rec ' d just after 0 . 00 on wednesday_morning .
M	i '_ll be avoiding like the plague in future and believe that they are representing the ford name in a very poor manner .
M	no time was on it so i used my phone and checked the tracking_details .
F	i avoid this social_network .
F	only problem is having to be in to sign for it otherwise its a trip to the depot but that '_s down to royal_mail !
F	two springs were missing from the box .
F	so overall disppointing , a good way to declutter if your not too bothered about making money on your items .
F	not what i orded i specifically orded the heaven sent bunch as they had fressia in as this was for my parents 00th_wedding_anniversary and these were one of the flower iin
F	will i buy from digitalrev again ?
M	!
F	booked my disney_tickets day before travel and received voucher by email within hours .
M	everything turned_out fine in the end but it was a bit of a tense flight wondering_if there would be a car for me .
M	they offered me another test which i had to return later for .
M	image my frustration when i got home on 00nd_may to find a returned to depot card from royal_mail_stating it was too large for letterbox .
F	!
F	fortunately her very honest neighbour confirmed that they were indeed meant for my daughter .
M	no need to waste time on - line as the prices were competitive too .
F	although primark is good and carries a lot of stuff and at good prices , sometimes the quality of the items is a bit_iffy , for instance , i bought 0 pairs of shoes ( womens ) at £_00 each , and they only lasted one season , i was not wearing them every day either , the heels wore down quickly and they got very scruffy looking very quickly .
F	dpj000 .
F	and if so can you change your website so people know .
F	our builder recommended sds .
M	i '_ve_used juno a couple of times and each time the record i have bought arrived quickly and was packaged well .
F	as a 00 year_old student who has just moved across the world from canada to the uk , trying to find the easiest routes in the most effective and inexpensive way is very valuable to me .
F	received a phone_call on tuesday , telling_me one item was discontinued but they did have the 000 pack available which i didn_'_t want , so cancelled the whole_thing .
F	00_hrs after_placing order i had the items in my hands .
M	they are meant to detect your booking via your license_plate - that didn_'_t work ( and i suspect that was a problem for others trying to enter at same time ).
M	finally , i couldn_'_t find prices anywhere to compare with these , in fact the cost locally would have been 0 times more and to my eye the quality was certainly no better .
F	blt delivered quickly and i can now see to type !
F	cancelled the order and ordered through someone_else to find that they also use this company .
F	delivery tracking very good and arrived quickly
F	i spent £_00 on two_pairs of glasses .
M	with such an easy website to view i made my choice of fabric for my waistcoat , i was impressed by the small swatch of fabric you receive .
M	i have now been working all morning to apply update to windows 0 - they managed to install their shovelware , but not update the system .

M	will_definitely order from wiggle again .
M	i am going to make a short video for watchdog highlighting my plight if my issues are not resolved soon , as i do not want others to suffer as i have .
M	this has to be the poorest delivery company to grace this planet .
M	what a stunning guitar it is , too !
F	a good fast service and on time too .
F	i gave almost 0_months notice .
M	speedy delivery of my order was most welcome . the cumbersome approach to refunding vat for guernsey residents is not .
F	i bought an exercise_bike - after_researching i found the best deal on sweatband .
M	in fact , it is nigh on impossible to move without it disassembling itself ; it is very heavy .
F	the order came as promised but took a week to come .
M	however , their delivery company nightfreight is utterly and forced me to cancel my order .
F	i was extremely upset about this and would be very much put off using the service again or recommending it to others .
F	some of the message was left off the card , so the recipient was confused with who they were from !
F	loads of problems trying to order online using my card , as i got_married and changed my name on the card and different number it still refused me and reverted_back to my maiden_name tried_ringing the service desk and they couldnt help me so i can never shop at tesco . com
F	thank_you for the speedy delivery , very impressed with your top rate service .
F	having a son and a sister in the usa we have travelled to the states at_least two or three_times a year and have always been more than satisfied with the service provided .
M	i then needed to remove a metal bumper underneath , and then slide the towbar into the slot where the metal bumper was once fitted .
F	i got what i wanted at a lower price than where i do my grocery_shopping .
M	maybe this will provoke a response and preferably some recompense .
F	i had a handset which i knew was probably worth selling , envirofone offered the best price and it was easy to enter the model into the website , select the method i would like to receive my payment and then sit back and wait !
M	no way those cables and connectors were worth £_00 .
M	0 days_later get an email to say my phone is being shipped ( apparently it was too late to stop it from being sent ?).
F	will definitely recommend you to my friends .
F	many_thanks for a speedy delivery
M	excellent work . perfect fit , excellent trim , friendly staff and timely despatch .
F	after several orders now i am afraid i have to suspend doing my shopping with ebuyer and just stick to amazon .
M	we do not know if we will ever get a complete kitchen .
M	i have bought several items through top cash_back .
M	the fuel_tank has a capacity of 00 litres and at the cost of fuel in malaga at e0 . 000 per_litre - a full_tank of fuel on empty would have cost e00 euro .
M	0 minutes later my lasagne was returned , nuked to an inch of it '_s life and my girlfriends macaroni and cheese minus the raw bacon .
F	when i purchased this product i didn_'_t expect the expiry_date to be the month that was nearly over already !
F	i ordered a size 00 bikini .
M	quick service and swift delivery .
F	i spent a lot of time and trouble looking after them .
M	finally never use interlink again
M	i had to call bulk_powders 0 times and each time was treated very well , but they were calls i shouldn_'_t have had to make .
F	when i called back to report this , i was told that i still have to pay the £_000 but that i can spread this in my direct_debit over the next 00 months .
M	i was concerned that there may have been a leak , but after topping it up there appears to be no movement in the level .
F	claim that their delivery policy is made clear on ordering - it isn_'_t !!
F	even still its nice to know that the pennies mount_up into pounds
F	products ordered on the net do not arrive as quickly as those ordered by telephone .
F	i got some revlon intament perfume from you i use to wear it in my teens . and everyone said how lovely it was and all these years later people still ask me what i am wearing as it smells lovely
F	high_quality product and excellent and precise delivery !
F	it was enjoyable to shop on glasses_direct .
M	da_jeg luftede denne utilfredsked , fik_jeg blot at vide , at de_havde et hold til at svare på klager på trustpilot og facebook .
F	ps0 disc reader fixed within an_hour !!
F	i had one very disappointed teenager after this !!
F	this is not acceptable and the second time i have had to do another emergency order and then claim back the prepaid funds for the lost orders later . no point in free delivery if it never arrives !
F	a few_days after the order i receive an_email_telling_me that my frames are discontinued in the size 00mm but they can change the order to 00mm .
M	i accidentally ordered a watch from yourselves before checking my finances .
F	theyre quite slow and i always seem to find hair in my food .
F	if this hadn_'_t been offered i probably_wouldn_'_t have been able to go as i would have been too worried_about the tickets not arriving in time .
M	i run a plumbing business so im not happy with them and my customer is not happy with me .
M	as these two arms were fitted to the exact_same fitting points that the previous two arms were fitted ( they lasted for 0 - 0 years ) then one would assume if the fitting is incorrect , then the previous arms should have broken !!
F	driver was not at arranged meeting_point on time , it was frustrating watching other_travellers meet and greet drivers coming and going while we were still_waiting .
F	i bought a pink bunny outfit for my little_girl .
M	not even the decency to communicate properly with customers !!
F	great service , would certainly order from them again .
M	each day i have called after waiting in and been promised that i would ' certainly receive the phone tomorrow '- complete lies .
F	the flowers were delivered to the wrong house !
M	( 0 ) " there has_been breakdown in the internet ".
F	before we had left the dock we went to the bar , as i am a non drinker of alcohol i ordered a can of coke , i was told that they don_'_t sell cans at the bar only draught .
M	this company is absolutely_useless at communication and customer service .
F	totally disgusting and crappy customer service .
F	i '_ve earnt about £_000 so far , just for shopping for things i was going to buy anyway , or using things like their car insurance search_engine ( which i '_ve actually found to be one of the best for finding me the cheapest quotes ).
F	i am absolutely appauled by their service .
F	' it best bl_** dy not be !'
M	peanut_butter not as nice as other_companies .
F	it is now 00 april but still no refund .
M	phoning around_midday they said my flights had been cancelled - still with no clear explanation .
F	second time i took_advantage of the pre_- oiling service which saved my fitter a lot of time !
F	i had trouble_redeeming a voucher and signing into their system so used their online_chat .
F	got a phone_call to say my order was coming but would be late .
F	item arrived as expected and within stated delivery timeframe .
F	with my most_recent order , i selected next_day delivery because i really needed it today , but it didn_'_t arrive .
F	they came in a box and they were ruined . all burnt and brown !
M	the whole website has to be revamped .
F	everything perfect each time !
M	they never did .
F	could not have got the items quicker and easier if had bought in store .
F	the flowers finally turned_up on monday after mother '_s day and as they had obviously been in transit for days we ' re half_dead !!
M	!
M	when i complained and send the photo and called them the lady on the phone was very rude and asked me to wait for an email to what their decision was got the email and all it said was sorry we cannot do anything .
F	i also emailed thedrinkshop . com at the same time i contacted city_link but got no reply - so they didn_'_t care about my shopping_experience then - why care now ?
F	delivery service good but ordered magimix toaster which did not work on delivery - no power .
F	i confirmed that they were correct .
F	it used to be the sum total of your order could be spread over 00 weeks or 00 weeks , now it '_s each_individual item which can make the payments too high therefore limiting the number of items bought , so catalogue is missing out on profit .
M	not quite the effect i was looking for .
M	received a brand_new one the next_day !
F	we tend to travel with their premium service ( not upper but better_than economy ) and you tend to pay £_000 /£ 000 more per_person per flight - so a family of 0 it racks up .
F	not only was this unacceptable and diabolical enough , leaving me in such a rush , but when i read the face value of the tickets £_00 . 00 each i had paid over 0 x each per_ticket plus nearly_£_00 for p_&_p that arrived so late i nearly_missed the show !
F	i lost the chance to give my order as a gift .
F	i would have continued with the order as it was 00_%_discount weekend .
F	rooms over_£_00 include and english_breakfast served at the duke william and car_parking is available @ £ 0 for 00_hours .
F	i requested sunflowers but there was not one in the bouquet and the greeting_card to say who they were from was for some else entirely .
M	on a positive_note i would definitely use ' national_tyres spon end , coventry ' again as service was first_class a very ' can do ', professional and friendly service .
F	maybe item should have been thoroughly checked before dispatch .
M	had chucked the packaging away by the time i used them in anger so stuck with them for now .
M	the service and quality was really first_class .
F	she is going to send me a picture which i would be happy to forward in the future .
F	was very happy with the silver bar , delivery was spot_on too .
F	i have used partyrama before and had no_problems ; however this time was a totally different_story .
M	i have received over 00 sales emails from you already this month !
F	i ordered three products from the website which are currently being promoted on facebook ( calorie free spreads ).
F	unfortunately when we arrived to collect our keys it took a while as they were put in the wrong hook , no big deal but when we went to start the car , the key was broken . now the wrong hook made sense !
F	vert pleased with the service and products .
M	the service was excellent and speedy . the price was very good as well .
F	i bought 000 card wine bottle neck tags from wineware .
F	customer service was good but can '_t avoid the fact that the dualit_toaster i received was damaged , then had to wait a week for new stock / them to pick_up .
M	best price available , fifa_00 , and was delivered 00_hours_later .
M	check out was quick and easy , they first take money out therefore you have no way back .
M	when you rang back you said that it would be about half an_hour as the lorry was 00 miles_away which would take about 00 to 00_minutes .
F	i emailed customer service to outline my issue .
M	advertising stated free delivery on orders over £_00 .
M	this is appalling .
F	week_later i went back , another staff_member admitted the phone was left out the back and only sent off a day ago .
M	nothing extravagant but a great cheap hotel enjoyed it very much
M	at_least does not meet western travelers ' expectations !
M	' at yodel we really give you something to shout about .'
M	you would like to receive sales emails from a company that has failed to deliver your original order
M	!
F	instructions were to leave at next door if we were out , very cross !!
M	just as well you can get a pair in a couple of hours on the high_street - which is where i suggest you go as_opposed to getting rubbish service and useless goods via the web .
F	i bought some asics netball shoes for my daughter from barrington_sports .
M	i used silver_shuttle for the first time , this week .
F	i was kept_informed by serenata_flowers , first that they had received my order , then that the flowers had been dispatched and finally that they had been delivered .
F	easy to use , good service plently of choice as the first time ive done this
M	both phones we very well used but both technically worked ( the most_recent one more so ).
F	i will_definately be using fire_protection again
F	talk about late notice .
M	the parcel was not collected so i cancelled the order only to find out that the 0 % surcharge on paypal payments is apparently non - refundable .
F	one pair was also slightly wonky ( although not with the home_trial pair ) i am happy with the price , the level of service , the swift delivery , and also the product in all other ways though .
F	the order was delivered very quickly
F	if cosmetics now would use royal_mail i could have gone locally to the delivery office .
M	knowing this would be missed on cursory inspection upon_receipt
F	at_least i can get my money back - eventually
M	great price , delivery and installation went perfectly .
M	the product and price were good .
M	i would suggest that you get a map and try and see as much during the day as possible .
M	as an electrician i would not use your company again , i had to
F	worst experience ever !!!!
M	the nitrotek site can be a bit_fiddly to navigate , particularly from different sections of the same product , i . e .
M	they do not answer emails or telephone_calls and the next thing will be to visit them in person in burnley .
M	do not trust this company , 0 months waiting for a part , 0 email 0_weeks_ago to say part was " in transit " where from the far side of the bloody galaxy ?
F	i assumed from date of order , but apparently this is not so .
F	next_day , i waited for a call .
M	what '_s the point of an early cash out option on an accumulator if you can '_t access the site to do so ?
M	start to finish of the process only 0 days , first_class service .
M	ordered a bass speaker with email on 00 june saying it will be with you next working day .
F	and we are leaving very closed to nice ( good luck ) my wife phoned you this afternoon but nothing still happen so my comments if you excuse me are not very good , perhaps not directly your faulte but still we are waiting our things .
M	soon became evident from the poor condition of the packaging and the visible wear and tear marks on the drum pads that the kit was infact second - hand .
M	even worse , they deposit was refunded only as store credit .
M	i arrived at the woking store 0 minutes before closing but an employee watched me walk to the door and then locked it .
M	cannot_fault the service a0 will_definitely do_business with them again .
F	but the bag was squashed into the packaging box which was too small for the item - therefore the bag is badly_creased .
M	recently ordered an amp and speaker from gak at 0 oclock on monday , and at 00 am on the tuesday fedex were on my doorstep with my goodies !
F	so after purchasing two 0rd row seats for an event that my 0 year_old_son could see the main stage , the tickets were no_longer available ?!
F	website was easy to use and it was simple to find the remote_control we needed .
F	it always arrive on that date and within the date stated .
F	we visited london over christmas and bought a big_bus pass to see the sights and save the legs !
F	very expensive for not many flowers
M	legal_action is going to commence from tomorrow morning and i will_continue to namea and shame them throughout social_media until this is resolved .
F	it is very near the river - great for a stroll , coffee or trips to the port houses ( a must whilst in porto !
F	!
M	good all_round .
M	once @ dubai airport we received a terrible car , old , full off scratches and not in line with what we expected .
F	i then contacted serenta to complain , got sent round the houses and then never got a reply after sending them the image they requested .
M	thank_you
M	quick delivery with no_problems
M	footnote : as long as the tyres arrive when they say they will , you wont get a better price or service anywhere .
M	!
F	alexa
F	the cushion as a gift was a lovely idea but unfortunately it was not obvious from the computer_screen that the meaningful verse i had added should have been on the white shirt as it is not possible to read with the black_background .
F	the london traffic was busy even then , which_meant it would have taken 0 hours to go round half the red loop to get from westminster to hamleys , so we walked instead .
M	i was told i would have to pay for the item to be sent back unless i wanted to come into the store , but before 0pm .
M	can '_t believe they can miss that ?
F	ordered a coleman tent awning .
M	excellent selection .
F	however , the icing alone is no substitute for the cake !
F	city_link are the problem delivery wise without them i am certain we wouldn_'_t need to put in claims or call for assistance in tracking items .
F	only took 0_days from order to delivery
F	i only got half a pence_per_litre saving so , i don_'_t know if i '_ll use the website again for ordering , but will_continue to use it for comparison .
M	i could even go on ebay and immediately find items for cheaper .
F	everything automated and no help at all !!
F	other than this it is a good book
M	highly_recommended .
M	the most dire customer service i have ever received in my life .
M	i '_ve just started_using aria but i will be sticking around !
F	very pleased with products and delivery all items are perfect especially the personalised gifts thank_you very much and look_forward to using your company in the future
F	will_definately visit again
M	i really love the pc but it encountered some start up problems and when i contacted dinopc they were hesitant to return the pc and fix it .
M	i received a confirmation_email_confirming this .
M	much_cheaper_than our local shop . very pleased with product and service .
F	with nowhere to park in the street , it potentially looked as if a wait of several hours was going to happen .
F	they are also helpful if you ever have an issue with any of the cash_back offers and are great at keeping you up to date with progress on these .
M	the sales_assistant asked about protection , and basically wouldn_'_t shut up about it , i wavered and said i think not , and she yelled at me twice " just do it :".
M	at_least we didn_'_t order the lunch which would have been rushed in the time given .
M	0nd delivery date 0 pieces of faulty and damaged furniture arrived along with the wrong mattress delivered - a cheaper mattress than what we had paid for !
M	!
F	i picked the flowers on the basis of the colour .
F	happy with the product and delivery , but the promised free pillows were not delivered .
M	from the point of initial_contact to my delivery arriving safely on time the service was fantastic .
M	they passed the problem to their customer_services dept who promptly sent out a replacement .
M	the whole year is bad_experience .
M	very happy .
F	a couple of weeks_later i had to order an_alternative item .
M	my advice - for now , avoid this company at all costs .
M	ordered on monday , processed and dispatched on wednesday arrived thursday with express delivery , but beware you need to sign for it .
M	but when looking for something new to eat , it is very annoying looking for food .
F	we complaint right there and then but it seems to be taking more than necessary to get approval to order our key . let '_s hope it all ends well .
F	as i live on the first floor the delivery drivers refused to help get the worktop inside the door and left the worktop half inside and half out side the door .
M	utter , utter ineptitude , they do not deserve to be in business .
M	my order came before the estimated day stated . the packaging was very sturdy and everything was a0 . thank_you battery_force i will_definitely shop with you again .
F	it '_s 00 - 00_minutes everywhere_else in the world and they do fligh on the sky as well .
F	emailed regarding use / dosage / reapplication on bantams and no reply came .
M	wouldn_'_t hesitate to use bernard '_s bins again , great service .
F	bah oui , ils faisaient mais plus maintenant .
F	cat_food arrived day after i placed my order .
M	and from the time of ordering up to time of despatch she was
M	fantastic , all complete within 00_hours .
F	tried three_times to sort_out the problem with customer_services who are rude , unconcerned and barely audible , don_'_t know where their call_centre is based .
F	im not sure what else i was expected to do , having already sent 0 messages and clocked up a whopping hour ( plus ) of time on an 0000 number .
M	i duly phoned to confirm and placed the order over the phone then .
M	won_'_t recommend this to anyone
M	very dissapointed in customer_services .
M	difficulties of getting something big from a to b were completely sorted by using anyvan ; once i had described what i needed , quotes came through in 00_mins , and were v . competitive .
F	i have just read your reply and yes i was told my item was in stock and then i ordered it .
M	paid for one month license expecting a good outcome to help me thrive in fifa_coins , however the complete_opposite occurred , the told me programming errors had occurred upon several_occasions causing me to lose all of my fifa_coins with no compensation because i didn_'_t look at their facebook_page due to being in school .
F	so far i have had 0 seats arrive without legs and then 0 sets of legs appear .
M	there is also the hassle of getting to a bank to pay the cheques in and having to wait a further 0 working_days to clear , so if you are in a hurry for your money . think again !
F	needless to say i will not be back .
M	really hope they '_ll eventually take on more premium_brands like norse projects , our legacy , a . p . c , wood wood , etc .
M	there was some_confusion and back - and - forth with emails , though , and the first pair i was sent were misaligned .
M	i would recommend and definetely use again grippy . co . uk to change any tyres .
F	as the length of cloth had already been cut .
M	highly_recommended !
F	they tell me this evening that the flowers are truly beautiful , for which i thank_you , but unfortunately the surprise and delight was spoiled .
F	well_packaged , arrived on time and sensibly_priced !
M	bloke was so rude when i did arrive 00_mins after his call .
F	signal problems never listened to the problem and just presented written excuses .
M	london , nw0 0fb
F	all packaged perfect .
M	this review is now a little redundant as sky is buying out o0s ' customer base .
F	this did not happen and i only realised my item was missing when i received the delivery dispatch email .
F	£_00 !
M	not a happy_chappy .
M	i will buy from them again .
F	i called back leaving a message for a supervisor to call me back .
F	flowers arrived on time although a smaller bouquet that i was expecting .
F	very helpful and friendly staff at the end of the phone and considerate when needed
M	so everything_went well until the change over .
F	i have been trying to get insurance for my 0 granddaughters who will be travelling_alone , one is 00 , the other 00 .
M	i bought a motor for a sebo vac which was great and they had a great video_tutorial .
F	next time i '_ll try selling it on ebay . one more positive . at_least it was freepost .
F	customer service very poor so would not use again .
M	the 0 hour experience was over priced for a beginner .
F	still_awaiting delivery & have even taken my money
F	thus began a lengthy and frustrating correspondence resulting in me being sent a different colour cord from a returned faulty item .
M	checked the status of the order to find ' awaiting id '.
F	only upon querying the contents was i told the item was out of stock i don_'_t have the good fortune that i can feed my pets anything therefore i was disappointed as half of his food wasn_'_t in stock im now left with 00 tins of food he cannot eat as we had to change his food yet again !!
F	the mot was not worth the paper it was on , and vosa failed the van on over 00 major points .
M	david : i was told if found it would be sent back to me .
M	first thing the next_day the part arrived and fitted_perfectly .
M	i wait and then only bluetooth device is delivered .
F	no stars out of 0 if i had the choice
M	hostelworld is perfect , it saves me a lot of time since i don_'_t have to walk around anymore looking for the right place to stay .
F	the vouchers that arrived were national gardening vouchers not longacres , which i could have bought anywhere .
M	i got a £_00 bouquet for my wife for christmas , it looked nothing like the picture on the site .
M	easy , navigatable website to select appropriate cartridges with full product description , whole_process through to confirming order is a breeze !
M	never have they taken any responsibility for the situation , blaming in turn the supplier , someone_else in the shop and sometimes even me .
F	easy website to use , brilliant prices and extremely fast delivery .
M	you spend hours creating these items and want to see them the following_day .
M	also wasn_'_t expecting the flowers to be artifically dyed .
M	nothing .
F	the dvd is very good to especially the dance and comedy aspects . could it have carers notes to accompany it please as the one for the magazine is very helpful .
F	the flowers always arrive when stated and in a good condition .
M	i did specify on the order that i would be away for ten days , so please ensure that the shed wasn_'_t delivered until after that .
M	i asked for £_00 which i thought a reasonable and not extortionate_amount .
M	very satisfied with the service .
F	flowers seemed a lot smaller_than the picture , but are very nice .
F	web_site was not quite the ticket and the person supposedly in charge of it could have been more on the ball .
F	finally got in villa e at 0 . 00pm ( check - in time 0pm ) we were made aware the cleaners had started at 00am , but there was only 0 ladies to clean 0 villas in 0 hours ??
M	thanks michal .
M	when the food arrived the ice had ( just i think ) which i did not complain_about , i looked out for the extra chicken which did not arrive .
M	flight - flawless
M	if it were not for this , myprotein would be getting 0_stars !
M	he deserves a medal , raise , promotion , or all 0 !
F	i say called , i never actually spoke to a human !
M	i had also chosen not to write a message as i had one already planned but a plain card was sent with text inside saying " the sender has not chosen to write a message " or something along those lines and the recipient just looked at me as if to say well that was pointless .
F	i was pleased !
M	they are solid , 00mm_thick and very heavy , bear that in mind when you order as fitting is at_least a two man job .
M	the first cooler was cancelled quickly and the windows 0 copy dispatched for which i am pleased .
M	all other_companies we used provided everytime on time and efficiently .
F	helpful , informative and generally excellent at all_stages of the process
M	the last problem was although i clicked the link on my previous order so as to get exactly the same tiles they are different .
M	i would recommend endclothing to any of friends as they have a good selection of desginer labels at a good price , the service is spot on .
M	this is the second radiator delivered as distance on first was the same .
F	i find everything i want at this website and it offers good value for money as well as a good delivery service .
M	the offer was for a free game , of a choice between mafia 0 and civilization 0 .
M	what '_s worse is they advertise rrps higher_than the price they ' re selling at , making out you save 00_% or whatever , when in reality they ' re selling at the standard price , same as everyone_else .
F	i have emailed a complaint and no one has responded - at the end of my tether now - hoping someone will respond on here at_least as they seem to !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
M	does_exactly_what it says on the tin .
M	had we known that you have got to chose a seat and pay extra , we could have either looked elsewhere or paid for it at the time of the original booking .
M	promised delivery was00 hrs late
M	paced my order and i received it within 00_hrs
M	exceptional service , clear and ' easy to use ' web ordering .
F	customer service has_been good since we sent in a complaint , shame that the transfer company in mallorca is unreliable and the actual service wasn_'_t provided .
M	i still have a quibble with the " in stock " label ; it appears that they update this manually , and it doesn_'_t always get updated when items go out of stock .
M	why drive to garage and pay more if all can be done on your drive .
M	well no .
M	the very nice lady i spoke with said that the system showed the posters had been dispatched by 0nd_class post the day after my order , and promised to send another batch first_class the next_day if they hadnt arrived .
F	we were emailed within 00_hrs to say that our cards had been despatched and would be delivered 0 - 0_days_later .
F	:)
F	so be warned ; you may have to wait longer for your order than you '_ve been told .
F	i struggled to unload and get a trolley and look after my toddler and he stood and watched .
F	i hate their slow and piecemeal delivery .
F	easy to use and speedy delivery very well_packed .
F	once arrived , item was in a huge box where only a quarter of the space in box that was used for items .
F	no more scale , no more scrubbing , seriously wish i had taken the plunge years_ago .
M	marketing products at a price that undercuts the competition is fine providing trekkinn can actually deliver within a reasonable timeframe otherwise it is a complete_waste of time for all parties .
F	as this is a small_hamlet i am sure a neighbour would have brought them over to her .
M	if i hadnt joined it and cut out the hob i would have sent it back
F	bookcase is lovely though .
F	they sent out the wrong item and it had to be returned .
F	this is supposed to be fresh_meat .
F	every time i have ordered from viovet they have delivered the goods in two_days .
M	absolutely_appalling .
F	b ) he was very overworked and grumpy and had been busy all morning .
F	regards
F	can not recommend this company enough .
M	because of an error the one on display had been recorded as stock .
F	the other three pairs she could not even get them past her knees .
M	a big hole where a once working radio was with the bracket bent beyond_repair ( i was told that removal of bracket would take two minutes not an_hour ).
F	thank_you so much serenata_flowers .
M	arrived within a couple of days .
F	arranged for thursday , no time given .
F	diverted off at ashford so missed my 0 . 00pm sailing .
F	i have had two_pairs of shoes from shoe international , both_times had very good service and very quick delivery . i fully recommend them .
M	their response to me
F	i have requested twice_now for an rma number so that i can return the product that i bought , yet you have still not replied .
F	?
M	i mean all three items , three totally different items not in store . why ?
M	expected better quality packaging , most of the items were stuffed_into one box with the packaging ripped_open and badly taped_up .
F	quick delivery but arrived in torn broken packaging which looked as though someone had tried to open it and it was wet and dirty . if the quilt had not been in a polythene_bag it would have ruined
F	excellent service , very competative_prices , fast efficient next_day delivery , helpful staff .
M	is it no wonder this country is going down the pan when we have to deal with incompetent companies like that .
F	having had furniture from oak_furnitureland before , i had no_hesitation in ordering more .
M	the assistant came back with my glasses .
F	really disappointed that product was not tested and faulty goods were despatched .
M	i checked the prices with my local tyres fitters and it would have been £_00 dearer to go there with the added grief of having to leave my car there etc .
M	radiator is perfect for my needs , and a very fair price but i had to wait 0_weeks after being told the wait would be 0_weeks .
M	that gave some stress , as i wouldn_'_t have internet and needed the voucher sooner .
F	better customer service can definitely be found elsewhere !
M	and even then - the address was a po_box number - how are you supposed to find it anyway ?
F	no reply to emails and phone always " engaged ".
M	over a day late .
M	there has also been allegations of the site refusing to ' display ' and therefore advertise certain films .
F	other_sites were offering them at £_000 ish so i decided to try them .
F	interlink system for redelivery seems to be lacking in a system some how .
F	switched gas supplier from npower to sse in august last_year .
M	great company to deal with good prices and special_offers .
M	massively disgraceful .
F	delivery for all 0 confirmed and therefore the day before we cleared out old furniture .
F	this is the second time i '_ve_used .
F	excellent product , brilliant service , polite and helpful staff and drivers .
M	if you are staying in glasgow i would not recommend premier_inn .
F	good customer service but too expensive for delivery and returns .
F	i will definitely return .
F	steve whom works there doesn_'_t have a clue about bmw and staff are real rude
F	that '_s the only_reason i didn_'_t give it 0_stars .
F	i was told they were on route to the courier , told when they had them , told when they were on route to thr recipent and told when they received them .
M	asking 000dollars for that was wrong and made me angry .
F	i was advised to use the phonenext time to re order to avoid mistakes .
M	yet again they have swiftly side stepped the issue and tried to revert the blame on the customer .
F	this is a good car but the staff late at night were not helpful really , hired a smart car with in car sat_nav , this was not pointed_out to us , ( never had this in my own car ).
M	this will be lower_than what you will be guaranteed off far better known and reputable_companies .
F	not in the best condition but got the price they said when i sent it to them .
F	thanks
M	i did not renew at this time and put the phone down .
M	the packaging of the camera was inadequate and the corner of the camera box was damaged .
F	the only_thing i would fault was the lack of signs telling us where we had to go to wait for the bus transporting us to the actual airport .
M	good prices , easy to order , fast delivery
M	update_: it looks_like the years interest free credit will have run out by the time we have a complete kitchen .
M	from the telephone_helpline , through the straightforward website to the prompt delivery and great value too .
F	delivery was quick & free
F	no one else out there was even willing to try to hit our deadline and it was a pleasure_doing_business with usb0u .
M	best price , super value looks top_class cos it is , easy so easy no flapping they do the hard work and check it all for you , yes there is someone in town that does it but to hard to deal with , sign_builder done my first van and will do my 0nd and 0rd plus every thing else , the only thing i would like to see is t - shirt printing service .
M	this as_opposed to " this is not an item we normally keep in stock ".
M	i was recycling 0 old_phones , one of them was my old_blackberry .
M	vendor would not help or budge at all .
M	did not rate them for the money poor quality thin rubber 0mm , would not recommend them , fitted ok
M	the worktop_express site gave a lot of good information about different woods and how to care for them .
M	good phone suport ( in portuguese ), excelent service and very good site with good information about the products .
M	it isnt made clear that the flowers would be so small .
M	the car was great and it was completely hassle_free .
M	though my costume didn_'_t come complete and that put the panic in things .
M	i pay 00 months line rental saver and i received my bill today and they have now charged me again for my line rental , so to date i have been charged_twice for my line rental !
F	so i had to find it out myself .
F	so pleased i joined wowcher have purchased items i would not have normally .
F	the invoice was sent by e_- mail immediately after_placing the order and confirmation and tracking of the order was also sent through once the goods where dispatched ( same day ).
M	so be warned if you complain you will get bumped around from pillart to post !
F	coming_back - another wait and then a hike around various car_parks with ours last .
F	home delivery excellent , fast and efficient .
M	read great reviews about monkey_nutrition '_s great service and fantastic products and decided to try them for myself .
M	this was 0 / 0 / 00 !
M	no problem with refresh though , in stock and despatched within_00hrs .
F	also nice to have postage tracking_info sent through .
M	i bought a fabro i0000p from dinopc , it appeared to be great value compared to the other deals out there .
M	i hope i don_'_t need to but i feel able to talk to them if a problem arises .
M	i have recommended marlow '_s to many friends , who are as delighted with the company as i am .
M	first time using azimo and it was easy and cheap sending money overseas .
M	i called and they said they dont price match amazon even_though its them selling it !
M	i have placed a few orders with country_attire over recent months .
F	we really enjoyed the tour .
M	so clearly this is nothing to do with postage time .
F	easy to find what i wanted and best prices i could find for dog and wild_bird_food .
F	here is my experience so far with them .
M	booked this at 00 . 00 and courier never showed up .
M	customer service poor .
M	what the hell is wrong with this company ?
M	the cheque turned_up on saturday_morning .
F	having recorded the delivery and questioned them about having actually signed for package , they now claim they had received the package but the packet was empty ( no handset ).
F	after 00_minutes of waiting i did not get anywhere apart_from finding out that they are completely_useless giving different answers to the same question and laying that they would put me straight through without further wait .
F	assured that the engineer didn_'_t knock my door as he " just had to connect the phone line ".
M	how can it be stolen if i could still make calls with it ?
M	product as_described at a good price and delivered promptly .
M	.
M	of course , once opened , only the espresso_machine was inside so i had to call dpd again to find out the whereabouts of the second part of my order and was told it must be my own fault as a second delivery was attempted later that morning ( 0 hours after the cut_off time i had paid for and 0 hours after the first delivery ) and i had not been in .
M	my opinion above_says it all
M	great service , good value .
F	agree with others who have had a bad_experience of this company .
M	had a small issue with second delivery , called customer_services who were fantastic , dealt_with problem without the usual quibble and side step we have come to expect from standard companies .
M	the whole purchasing process is easy .
M	great value and very please with the two i bought .
F	i ordered from the website on monday_afternoon and it arrived in the post tuesday_morning !
F	mum was very happy with the gifts but it had been a very stressful 0 hours for both of us .
M	would certainly use again .
M	very impressed with tel contact .
M	the packaging is also top quality ( ive ordered bottles of liquid that always arrive perfect .
M	lot ’_s of fun !
M	helpful driver .
M	!
M	i ordered quite late in the evening and the order was delivered the following_day , on a saturday .
M	making a second booking has the effect of silently cancelling the first and so you pay full charges for the first booking .
M	customer service is excellent .
M	i probably wont be putting it back on .
F	i then have to go in and book the parking again using a different credit / debit_card and it is then accepted .
F	after making my booking and payment , i didn_'_t receive any notification of when the fitter would arrive .
M	we were attending a family wedding and meeting family who had flown in on other flights before picking_up the rental car .
M	no one answers the " all times " help line and they charge you for the call !
M	the outbound_journey was cancelled following the ship sustaining damage after colliding with the dock .
M	so now the price was not 000 , but almost 0000 danish kroners .
F	i thanked them for their email but then stated that i would like an actual response to my issues .
F	and if you pay them within the stipulated time without interest is great .
M	in their email they wrote that they ' upgraded ' me to the next_day delivery .
F	order your tyre and making an_appointment is easy to do .
M	simple to use and with email_confirmations and reminders at every_stage to let you know what is happening to your sell order .
M	a way that gives clients and customers at home or in businesses the service they want and need .
F	enjoy family feud immensely .
F	after this i demanded a refund , which was done promptly .
M	fast delivery but quality was poor on quite a lot of images even_though the original was good quality taken with a good camera .
M	the up shot is that my son has had phone for nearly 0_weeks and to top it all off they want £_00 of me so they can sebd the phone back .
M	had a nightmare with this company .
M	bought an arte shower_rail kit , the chrome rail itself doesn_'_t match the chrome of the other parts and appears yellowish in colour .
F	we haven_'_t unpacked our radiators yet as we have other jobs to complete still before we fit them .
M	as the slow_speeds in certain_areas and cripplingly frequent packet loss demonstrate , the small company don_’_t possess enough clout to force bt ’_s hand to increase their bandwidth when they need it most .
M	( customer_services please take_note !!!)
F	no cartridge included .
F	ordering was very easy , and customer service was great , i ordered the wrong_colour and quickly emailed to see if i could change this - it wasn_'_t a problem .
M	postage too expensive .
F	right from the very first point of contact to when we arrived home their communication has_been second to none .
F	had the labels etc posted , and then posted phone back .
M	since being introduced to capital on tap by chris hill some months_ago i have found this facility very easy to use and the staff very helpful and efficient .
F	i think people need to contact trading_standards for them to check that the public are not being lied too for them to make more money .
F	however , when i telephoned the store on 00th_april_0000 regarding the strong_smell from the wardrobe i was informed that it would go in time and to leave the doors open - not very satisfactory as i had left the doors open since it was delivered at the end of march_0000 .
F	i shall be ordering again .
F	great website .
M	too much messing_around to use them and constant e_- mails have unsubscribed but still get get them
F	it '_s easy to get a prescription from the vet -- and if you can '_t , change your vet which is what i had to do - and now i upload my prescription with viovet , place an order and it '_s with me in a couple of days and at a fraction of the cost .
F	thought i would receive a work of art .
M	i am determined to persist with global as i '_ve been to their store and staff there are the most helpful i have come_across .
F	ordered for a friends birthday late_sunday_evening , delivered promptly tuesday_morning as requested we were kept_fully_informed as to the status of our delivery by text and available on line .
F	i just wish they would have done what they said they were going to do instead of lying to me !
F	one of the phones was returned completely with the screen still smashed and the second one was supposedly fixed however the screen has a big scratch on it and the bottom half of the touch screen does not work at all .
M	all companies that show up under their " compare " are part of their " group " of scam companies .
F	the additional_information on each product is also helpful .
F	bought a drawer_unit and it arrived damaged .
M	the poor repair of the shower_curtain in place of the broken section of shower_screen in the master en_suite ; the shower_head which wouldn_'_t stay upright in the double ensuite ) plus the mould in the master ensuite , the dirty loungers , etc .
F	quick and easy process to order but delivery schedule takes far to long compared to other_suppliers .
F	higher_nature have a very good range of the best products available anywhere , especially taking into account the current difficulties with regulations .
M	so they got there in the end .
M	item could not be collected from a store .
F	not very happy - the day after i received my order prices were reduced by 00_%
M	i had paid £_000 !
F	x
M	i spoke to two different people a few hours apart - they could not confirm whether they were in fact in stock or when they could be delivered - i asked what was the point in stating 0 - 0 business days delivery and was told that in fact they needed a whole day to process the order and that if i read the small_print the delivery it was only an estimate - i was insensed - the builders were ready to put the small floor in my porch and they could not build the cupboards until the floor was in .
M	i can fully recommend chemist0u , their service is exemplary and i received my items within the timescale given at the time of making my order .
F	another night and by then i was in so much pain i called customer service in tears , my back was unbelievably painful .
F	order was quick and easy .
F	when we did find a suitable_tenant we then had delays getting the checks done .
F	if there were a " no star " option i would have chosen that .
M	it arrived quickly and the site is simple to nagivate along with a great community .
M	is bent and split you cant lower the spare_wheel it has_been in a smash ,
M	these also broke within a week due to the same shoddy , cheap chinese manufacturing .
M	both sets of flowers were appalling and i am told barely lasted more than 00_hours and were chucked in the bin !
M	the hole centres on one arm was very different from those on the seat unit .
M	i ´_m waiting .
M	hadn_'_t heard of this company before when i came_across them on the net .
M	was okay , car was still there when we got there which was a good start !
M	this i think will prove to be an impossible_task .
F	no phone_call .
M	hang on .
F	she received them today and i am_disgusted to say that the flowers were wilted , half_dead and were in a vase of brown water !!!
F	no tracking of parcels and i had to contact them on numerous_occasions to chase the blinds as only half the set was delivered .
F	i rang customer service and was told to email . why when i am talking to you ?????
M	those " few_days " passed and still the same story .
M	sometimes you '_ll call 000 and get someone_who seems to know what they ' re doing and leave you with a pleasant_experience while 00_% of the time , you might come_across someone that doesn_'_t appear to know either what '_s going on .
M	completely_different_colour sent out as to the item ordered and cost £_00 to return in order to get refund .
F	i '_ll definitely use this website again .
M	order made , had to chase several days_later .
F	order not complete so i have to return most items as they were a set as a gift .
M	we have had a few problems and been frustrated at times , but these issues were always resolved quickly .
M	if many people have pain behind the knee might be worth having a product that also covers that area .
F	i always use aid but this time they did not deliver on the date agreed , i did get a call from the driver ( late morning ) saying there was a problem with the vehicle so they would deliver the next_day and put it down for an early delivery , it did arrive the folllowing day having phoned them to be told ' towards lunch_time ' it actually arrived at 0pm , so a bit dissapointed as had to wait in again but in the past they have been very reliable so hopefully this was a ' one - off ' and it hasn_'_t put me off using them in the future .
M	sadly it was for the wrong items .
M	i was not in and they have said on the tracking infomation they will try and delivery to me again tomorrow .
F	i phoned them within 0 minutes of placing the order and asked to cancel because of the card charge .
M	they have it all and know it all .
M	really pleased with the service .
F	opened my package , used my brushes for the first time and i am hooked im bugging the boyfriend to buy me some more they are very high_quality no bristle loss ans super smooth !!
M	well_done on getting the delivery to me next_day however lacking on the communication .
M	goods came when advised , well_packed and first_class service
M	nice bunch of roses ( got your prime quality ), but think it '_s overpriced .
M	the food that you supply is excellent i cannot say more .
M	would recommend
M	purchased a radiator through ring and reserve .
F	i was then offered to monitor my meter and take a reading at the same time of the day for the next 0_days , which i did .
M	definitely recommend .
F	i just hope the others were .
M	i told customer_services i am trying to save_money , not add it , and it should be against the law for them to change my policy after i had agreed to it but its in the small_print , they can do as they want once you sign up with them , a bit like the mobile_phone companies changing your fixed rate monthly_contract !
M	then comes the matter of the text_messages to which you can either only reply with a yes or a no , or even worse when you cannot reply at all .
M	factor in the 00mph vehicle limiter , the one way systems and ' pedestrian ' and / or ' no loading after 00am ' zones in city centres , or single drops that are nowhere_near any other drop that take another hour just for one packet ( that cannot possibly be cost_effective and would be cheaper to post ) and with an average of 00 drops per day it soon becomes a mammoth task to complete all drops within an effective 0 hours paid delivery window .
F	go to boots or your local_chemist and get whatever you need over the counter .
F	ordered before 0 pm order delivered next_day and at this time of year just unbelievable great service
M	bottom_line - i was considering re - mortgaging with them , but i '_m going to take my business elsewhere .
F	i contacted jessops_photo and as i was not going to be in glasgow apart_from that day , i asked for the photos to be sent to my home address .
M	day 0 ) envelope received
F	conveyancing team were the worst ever used .
F	hi i wanted to let you know that i had placed an order with animed for beanos ' worm and flea_treatments at a very good price and the order arrived within 0 working_days !
M	their response was simply " your parcel has_been dispatched and therefore we can amend any prices ".
M	they then told me i had to find uk sites that were official sellers and had the product in stock .
F	thankyou very much .
M	returns re a sizing issue in the past were handled_superbly .
M	as it was toning we wrongly took their word that all kit was in boxes , it wasn_'_t , we were lied to as they knew there were still items incomplete but put that all items were in boxes anyway .
F	!
F	i first used logodesignguarantee . co . uk in april_0000 for my partners window cleaning company and was pleased with the simple yet personal design i received , so when my mother in - law asked me about a logo for her business i was happy to recommend them and placed the order with all details of what she wanted and attached pictures .
F	i waited and waited for delivery , the said they couldn_'_t find the house and sent it back to the depot , so i had it redelivered to another address and waited in for it only for it not to turn_up and it was dropped_off at the post_office .
F	had to be signed for .
M	no_problems .
M	ordered a fridge_freezer and cooker_hood on friday_night at 00 0 clock and was all in my kitchen by tea time sunday .

M	i was therefore kindly sent a prepaid_envelope for return of the goods and subsequent refund .
F	i have sent wowcher 0 emails now , as yet i have not received a response ( apart_from their automated email ) yesterday , i telephoned them only to be told that they can not give me any information right now as there process has changed and there procedure is to call back or send an_email with the information .
M	delivery is very quick also .
F	thank_you very much .
M	not the best price in the marketplace but you know you ' re going to get your money .
M	s . a .

M	great website so easy to use and good prices .
F	a casual take on a cat eye sunglasses shape .
F	my sister had been in all evening and didn_'_t hear the doorbell ( she has a dog who always barks when the doorbell rings ).
F	i play many games on here and it is easy to get in touch with friends
M	they called me within 0 hours of placing my order to inform_me that one item that i had ordered was not currently available and how i would like to proceed .
F	it produced impressive results .
M	nothing was offered in exchange for this .
M	i have always found valueshop deliver the correct order in a timely_fashion .
M	i would have thought that if it '_s howing as available on their website then it '_s in stock but apparently not .
M	it turned_out that the firm was selling to me from the channel_islands ( presumably to save vat ), and the goods were mailed from a small town in switzerland .
F	if i could i would give no stars for this .
F	very happy you '_d love it
F	where do i start ??
F	would definitely buy from again .
M	received an email_stating there was a extended lead time on my delivery week_commencing 00 th december !
F	disappointed by the wrong product arriving . school advent .!!

F	if you cannot find us a hotel in glasgow , i expect you to refund not only the hotel booking you cannot ‘ honour ’(£ 000 ), but also the cost of other hotels we have already paid for during our holiday (£_000 ), our tickets to the commonwealth games (£_000 ) and the cost of our return flights to london (£_000 ).
M	shower cartridge arrived the next_day and was fitted there and then - really easy .
M	i can '_t get netflix where i live and it annoyed me that thousands of streamed movies and tv shows were so close within my grasp but so_far away .
M	who_knows .
F	!
F	for the record :
M	i also sent the email from kwik_fit and the lease company confirming that kwik_fit had replaced the bulb .
M	once again no_complaints would definitely use again .
M	the capsules don_'_t fit_properly in my nespresso and often just either fall through into the collection tray , or require extra positioning that regular nespresso_capsules do not .
F	i ordered flowers for a bereaving family on 00 november for same day delivery .
F	quite reassured to read these reviews and finding out i wasn_'_t the only experiencing problem with this company .
M	this is a company i would use again and again .
F	goods arrived promptly and i am satisfied with them .
F	no negative_points , will_definately use again .
M	would highly_recommend .
F	i recently ordered snugs extra padded heel grips which cannot be bought in local_shops and appear to be just what i need ( thus_far untried ).
M	trying to make changes to my booking involved endless referrals on their helpline , all resulting in being cut - off or sent to a voicemail_message .
F	do not use !
F	once i recieved the second top , the top is very see - through , the material is stiff and the printing is awful !
M	excellent , thanks mrmemory :-)
M	thank_you for your application .
M	continuously told certain items currently out of stock and will be delivered on a certain date , once date elapsed and no item received i had to approach them . again told the item is currently out of stock for another month .
M	£_00 every 00 / 00 months works out expensive .
F	very angry .
F	i truly would not write a review like this unless i felt it worth warning others – i tend to write_reviews when i experience good service as there are a lot of people out there who are ready to write damning reports .
F	they had clearly recieved the boots back , but didnt give me my money as i had not entered the code .
M	however has 0 issues .
M	truly an amazing product at an amazing price .
F	i found what i wanted in no time , ordered it easily and it arrived , well_packaged the next_day .
F	she has not .
M	only deliver once a week on a saturday .
F	i had to pay the fitter independently and the wrong amount was transferred_into my bank_account , this error had to be corrected
M	all i can say is that both sets of experiences have been faultless .
F	eye - watering !
M	excellent service .
M	they left a note yesterday , didn_'_t turn_up as promised today .
M	i eventually after five_minutes getting through to somebody was told there was a problem , i did recieve in another couple days .
F	great customer support - got call re delay .
M	good value & service
M	" i '_ll be back "
M	i have returned the cover but have not yet received the item i wanted .
F	i phoned sales and the person i spoke to was very patronising - had i unpacked the whole box etc - of course i had done this before i phoned .
M	it would be good to know the current_status and when a fix is likely .
M	and i nearly always go for these offers .
M	the whole_experience was effortless .
F	i am advised that the delivery courier will collect the wrong items when he delivers the right ones which , if it works , is very convenient .
F	wait while they cleaned and set a table .
M	battery_force had every thing i want at good prices .
M	i thought that was fair_enough and was confident that everything would be sorted_out , as i knew i had been totally clear about the timings .
M	0_weeks even_though i ordered and paid for a replacement on a separate order .
M	well maybe they should .
F	will use again .
M	very pleased .
F	fortunately , our son is returning to the uk just a day inside the refund period and , as the purchase was made in cash , it will be returned for a full_refund as it is faulty and not fit for purpose under the trades description act .
F	i had to arrange another delivery day without a card that was supposedly left by the driver on his fictional delivery .
M	i have brought from these_people many_times in the past , & they usually deliver in quickly , as a bathroom_fitter i trust i will be able to get the items i order within 0 or 0 days , there are cheaper companies out there , but beware a lot of these companies don_'_t hold stock & then will keep you waiting for weeks which is no good to me .
F	still no coat 0st apr
F	we have now booked two holidays through holidaysplease , both have been a good experience with no_hiccups !
M	!
M	our loved father and grandfather in portugal passed away recently .
M	bodybuilding_warehouse is my only stop for my gym needs .
F	i will never use their service again .
M	i advised that this was also unsuitable as : i don_'_t have a cheque book , i ' d have the extra hassle of posting out the cheque and the date was still unsuitable .
F	not happy at all and i will be complaining to partyrama
F	on the day of the show as we had not sold our tickets , decided to go see the show .
F	unfortunately we were sent a dodgy mis matched blackboard along with three normal / new ones because the warehouse was out of stock - bit of a poor show ?
F	i received my parcel quickly and all was what i ordered and in good conditions .
F	good quality item and delivery was super_fast
F	customer_services told me it was despatched on 00 april by royal_mail 0nd_class but i will have to wait another week before they will look into it for me .
M	highly_recommended , the customer service team have been great and always responded as promised .
F	make the chicken / meat dishes with less sauce and more meat .
F	!
M	the quality of the tools i had purchased was good , unlike previous_experiences with some internet shops .
M	these stages could be shown along a progress line .
M	full wired apt .
M	the fare type should be clearly_displayed as well as changes and cancellation_fees of the ticket .
F	i explained that due to the printing on the invites ( the rsvp by date ) that we needed them this week so we can send them to our_guests .
M	from the first phone_call to storing your stuff away they have it all slickly managed .
F	however our recent order has received a very poor level of quality and service .
F	i called back only to be told no delivery was scheduled and they had no idea why i had been told it was coming on friday .
M	we decided to stay with tradition of germany and put them in lederhosen . bruno lederhosen .
F	i now have to go to the depot to pick_up my purchase , which is much more inconvenient and expensive than it would have been to have simply gone out and bought the product from the shop !
M	!
F	my friends are staggered that i pay over_£_00_pm and only receive free texts and my handset isn_'_t all that either ( which i '_m stuck with for 00 mths !
F	i will use the company again .
F	ordered my stuff and i had put on the extra delivery information to ' not leave give to a neighbour ' and because they got royal_mail to deliver it , what happened ?
F	when i ordered something incorrectly , they corrected my order and even after my late_afternoon amendment still had it with me the next_day before_lunch !
M	unable to write a full review yet
F	i had ordered the bottom draw for my fridge_/_freezer .
F	so although it appears to be a good bargain for items once you add on the delivery charge on , it '_s pretty_much as such .
F	the staff were very friendly and i would use them again but i had an unlucky experience .
F	wont_be using again , would have rated as 0 but it wouldn_'_t let_me .
F	thank_you and will be sure to use you again .
M	hopefully my review will help others avoid being scammed .
M	i stored the box in the garage as i wanted to hide this present from my son until xmas day , he uses the garage too so i didn_'_t want to open it for him to discover it .
F	i posted it on monday and got my cheque on the wednesday .
M	i '_ve now been using allday pa since_0000 !
M	i order lots of things online and by far the worst service i have received by a courier , is from dpd .
F	if you buy big quantities is excellent and worthwhile otherwise it '_s not worth
M	i find you ordering_process so difficult to follow - it takes me ages
F	i have ordered this product [ lubrithal ] for my dogs eyes a few_times it arrives within 0 - 0days so for me thats a good service and i will_continue to use best pet for my dogs needs keep_up the good work .
F	would recommend and would definitely use again .
F	i use it everywhere i go and it saves me a fortune over the year ( last_year over_£_00 just over a weeks shopping ) sainsbury '_s has an easy layout of products allowing you to just pop in and grab or spend an_hour doing the weekly_shop , i do find i spend time wandering_around the home section though spending more money than i needed to and buying items that i don_'_t actually need , its very clever the way the layout is in sainsbury '_s !
M	vince .
M	shambles !
F	my email with proof of identity sat in his inbox for a week before i chased for a response so that the paperwork could be issued to me - this then seemed to take a while - and then an_error in signing the paperwork ( on my part ) meant that i had another 0 day wait before the " cooling_off period " could start .
M	my wife and i were looking for a nintendo dsi for our daughter '_s birthday and found this site .
M	why don_'_t they say !
M	so i write to sky on three_separate_occasions explaining this and receive one unsatisfactory call in response , therefore ignoring two other letters asking for information .
M	trading_depot had the item in stock , with a description as detailed as the manufacturer , and notified me of its availability for immediate_despatch .
M	you find out how good a company is when things don_'_t go to plan i ordered two products and one was wrong space doctor instead of head doctor easy mistake .
F	this has_been going on for 0_days and i '_m not at all impressed with their .
F	river_cruise was good and the crew were very jolly as was one of the bus comentators .
F	it could quite well have been re - sellable but , on enquiry i was told bluntly that a return and refund was not possible .
M	don_'_t buy from this company !
F	i will never ever use this company again .
F	customer service and basic '_s are missing here !
M	it was half the price norton were asking .
M	amazing that you can dry clean a car to a showroom finish .
M	quick delivery and customer service communication
F	le sachet de 00_kg été vendu à 00 . 00_euros en avril est maintenant à 00 . 00_euros !!
M	service is good .
M	top turned later than i wanted it and the size didn_'_t fit anyway but no invoice or receipt was enclosed so i '_ve no idea how to send it back !
M	i nearly just walked_away from the order when i went round and round a few_times .
M	fortunately , it was made of plastic but i had to brush off and fish - out the critters that used it for refuge .
F	in short if u want to waste money on limp disappointing flowers buy them from clare_florist .
F	i am still without the internet and suffered hours of frustrating customer service phone_calls at a premium_rate number .
M	update ( 00 april_0000 ) - despite confirming that my credit_card account has_been refunded with the cost of my cancelled order ( advised 00th_april ) i am still_waiting for the refund to appear .
F	thanks too .
M	fingers_crossed i guess that product arrives
F	a total_waste of tme ended_up fetching it from depot in end !!
F	the food ( royal_canin ) was the cheapest anywhere , the order process was easy and free next_day delivery .
M	these goods were ordered on 00 feb and delivery is not now scheduled until 00 mar .
F	i ordered two push - on tap shower sprays in chrome finish and they sent ones with white plastic finish .
F	do not use this company , disgusting rip_off !!!!!
F	the key advantage of your company is the availability of next_day delivery without having to pay an additional tariff .
F	i '_ve been really impressed , not just with the speed of service but with the courteous emails which keep me informed of the progress of the order from the moment it '_s made online to the arrival of the goods .
M	derek
M	the item arrived very promptly and i was very pleased to have been able to communicate so effectively and have my problem resolved .
M	got an email_saying item was dispatched and the earliest it could be delivered was 0 days_later .
F	great thing about the beanbag is you can move it so that he can sit_comfortably in it as well as lie when beanbag is flat on ground . definately recommend
M	notified of shipment by email .
M	decent prices too
M	having already bought a photobook from jessops i purchased a second photobook from photoworld after_seeing the rave review on television , but it '_s a shame because the product shown on the tele wasn_'_t the book they sent to me .
F	customer service is totally usless if things go_wrong - the worst i '_ve ever_encountered - they just don_'_t give a monkeys .
M	for me , all of this spoilt things a little !
F	that was on thursday , the goods didn_'_t arrive until the following_tuesday , i asked for a refund for the delivery charge and was eventually told that was ok .
M	i returned them back and now their customer_services rep vishu wont refund me as there warehouse cant confirm status of this return and i need to send them proof of postage !!!!
F	all went_swimmingly until i put my ticket in at the barrier and was informed that i owed £_00 !
M	only when i enquired_about price match did i get a problem .
F	over the past year or so cashback doesn_'_t track automatically with many retailers ( yes i clear my cookies , etc etc ) and then when a claim is submitted they take_forever to be sent to the retailer .
F	not !
F	my phone was submitted without a mark on it as had screen_protector on front and been in a case since the purchase but they reduced price by 00_% due to scatches on front & back !!
F	if these goods are not available then they should not be advertised .
F	very disappointed .
M	love the products , quality and the variety .
M	( no paypal rip_off )
F	excellent , efficient delivery service , good packaging .
M	i placed this order with you on the basis that you delivered on 00th_march .
M	alternative offered at a whooping £_000 more !
M	if your looking for protein my protein is the place to come .
M	still had to wait 0 0 / 0_weeks for them but with the level and professional service they provided over pervious suppliers i am more than happy to recommend them to other people .
M	the whole_process was seamless - many_thanks - best regards philip
M	sorry i don_'_t have time to do this .
F	no attempt was made to explain what i should be doing to rearrange delivery and no apology was offered .
M	excellent service , used home_trial which is excellent value and minimal hassle .
M	quick response and professional service
M	what is going on ??
M	cyclestore had best value with free_postage .
F	i ordered the kingston leather bag and i '_m so pleased with it .
F	suggestions .
F	to date i have still not had an acknowledgement of the email or a responce .
F	would i use them again ?
M	been waiting now for weeks to unlock my iphone , tried_contacting the company because one day the website says im waiting to be unlocked and then the next_day it says that there is no record of my order , not only that the company has charged me twice and will not contact me to tell me if this issue has_been resolved , all im asking for is someone to tell me whats_going on is that to much to ask ?
F	i would never recommend them , ever !
M	there are some small discrepencies in design so maybe they are indeed the wrong product .
M	however i found the delivery of £_00 ish pounds to be horrifically expensive considering there are some many companies that offer free delivery these days .
M	told every time that the parts would arrive the next_day .
F	it was easy to set_up the order , i liked the fact that a posting label was all set_up and the transfer was carried_out quickly and to full satisfaction despite there being a problem with the original tape sent in ( my fault ).
F	they constantly blamed shires , who make them .
F	the refund was received promptly 0_days_later .
M	fix the delivery issue and i would buy from you again .
F	a great company to book with realy profesional and went the extra_mile to make_sure everything went to plan .
F	thank_you ld_mountain centre .
F	i showed him proof of how long we had waited and the tracking_number and that was the end of the matter .
F	and they are always friendly and helpful no - matter what . you get the impression you are dealing_with friends not suppliers .
M	not too much to add .
F	i was very hesitant_about buying battery lights because i felt that they might be one of those things that are great in theory but rubbish in practice .
F	it definitely isnt !
M	after_speaking to one of their sales_team we identified the problem , identified the parts required and delivery for next_day arranged .
M	ordered a tnf jacket that i couldn_'_t find anywhere in my size and colour choice , in shops , not only was it £_00 cheaper_than shop listed price , but i ordered it on a sunday at about 0pm , paid for express delivery and got it by 0pm on monday .
F	i just had to wait for my phone to refresh .
M	easy , quick , good money - all_round win - win_situation !
F	the box was broken and crushed with the product half falling out .
M	i won_'_t be bothering again .
F	they have a great selection of bouquets to browse in a number of sizes and price ranges .
F	the guy serving me said i had to sign an insurance document for geek squad to receive the contract , " just so they have my details " and " to give me a complimentary 0 week insurance period ".
M	the set_up was easy and free and any interested tenants sent me an email which was easy to respond to .
M	i bought a dogs brush from animed_direct and i '_m very pleased with it it was free pp too as my old brush was to hard on my dog star new one is much_better and he seems to enjoy being brushed again .
M	i struggled that they said 0 - 0 days and asked not to chase for 0_weeks !
M	no way would i use this company again
M	i did get a standard successful delivery confirmation on the 00st , after we had left so i assume the second half of the delivery was delivered date the day after we left .
F	we were pleased with the prompt service and the pump seemed ideal .
M	as i '_m moving home ( and out of contract ) and was paying a considerable_amount per_month to sky you might have thought that for the cost of a telephone_call for my continued patronage might be worth it .
F	after care service - don_'_t think they have one !!
F	i ordered my goods and payment was taken immediately .
F	great info on the packaging about every_aspect of the chocolate you could want .
F	they delivered what they promised and the quality of the memory_sticks and standard of printing was spot_on .
M	it became worse when the alamo help_desk person had no idea where the pickup or drop_off was .
F	so i thought it is better to give the information to your services .
F	the directions on the actual " park and fly dublin " website were even worse !
F	plenty ?
F	this part arrived a week after the bbq did , but it was the wrong part .
F	i contacted customer_services before the 00th_december_0000 however to date have not received a response .
M	the glasses were delivered exactly as promised , very good quality considering the price paid .
M	the problem was that he just wanted a cheap flight and did not care where he sat so did not want to pay extra to chose where to sit ( as you normally do with other_airlines ).
F	ordered on a sunday_evening , bulbs arrived by tuesday_afternoon .
M	0_stars this time .
M	i bought a 0gb_memory_upgrade for my mac os x 00 . 0 . 0 .
M	i amsure i will be happy with the product when i receive it ( or rather my granddaughter will be ).
F	stores understaffed .
M	this time i insisted on staying on the line until i had been emailed with confirmation that the refund was in process .
F	excellent quality worktop was delivered quickly .
F	maybe a text_message system ( if you don_'_t already have one ) would be a good idea ???
F	a replacement tap was ordered on 00 / 00 / 00 but despite_numerous_emails , which were responded to at first , i still have not received a replacement and today is 00 / 00 / 00 .
M	but 0 ) they managed to deliver the toner .
M	they were bent by being taped_together too .
M	they have always been well received by my wife , mum , sisters and daughers on special occassions and being_able to hand pick is great fun - even two of the same .
M	dave george
M	however next_day came and no delivery .
F	that was six days ago !
M	very easy to use to find the right sunglasses .
F	would never use them again .
M	what more can i say ?
M	my parcel was passed_onto fedex in moscow on 00th_december_0000 according to parcelforce and they told me to phone fedex quoting my tracking_number to them .
F	thanks again and keep_up the great work .
F	over a week it took to get delivered to the store , i emailed customer_services who said we will send a text when it '_s been delivered to store .
F	the quality of the lens is amazingly good , perfect alignment and prescription .
F	missed a meeting to wait for delivery and didnt_recieve order until 0_days_later .
F	since i '_ve had the horrid contract it has_been nothing but a pain !
M	they finally got the out of stock item in and claim they have finally shipped the complete order out to me but only after ignoring about three of my emails and taking several days between my last email and their response .
M	item delivered twice broken .
F	the flowers have always looked the same as the do in the pictures , which is not always the same with some other_suppliers .
M	they offered a much_better rate than the banks , and the transactions took three_days only , due mainly to the proven systems they have in place .
M	but on this occasion would have been cheaper , with no time penalty .
M	many_thanks for your help laura .
F	called again and stayed on hold for 00_mins before being told it was cancelled .
F	parcel been taken but no confirmation left .
M	it was delivered quickly and arrived exactly at the promised time .
M	visually , there was a huge_difference , with a very thin , weak - looking foam on the fcc cup compared with the luxuriant , rich appearance of the n cup .
F	i found it slow and difficult to book flights on your site .
F	i am very very stressed about the whole_thing and i certainly cannot recommend this company .
M	after waiting 0 months for my £_000 cashback on sky i was told it was in the t &_c '_s that people in a block of flats is excluded from the offer . to which these terms and conditions are not clear in anyway on their site .
M	the price of the products was the cheapest i could_find it on the net at the time , the customer service was fantastic in terms of calling me back to confirm the product that i required , and last but not least , the delivery was incredibly quick ( especially when you take into account i opted for the free_postage ( 0 - 00 days ).
F	when i queried this it was because the requested tyre was not available but it took a lot of negotiating to sort_out the problem .
F	absoluelty no_problems .
M	after a week of putting up with the screen flicking issue i had the same problem with restarting phone and i took it to my local_store in lewisham .
M	thanks
M	note - they never call their customers back .
M	one item was missing . when i put the order in it said low stock . and the item did not arrive , so i worked out they didn_'_t send it and lucky refunded me for the item without having to ask .
F	0 comfortable bedrooms with comfortable_beds and air_con ( which is a must for a good nights_sleep ) great kitchen with everything you could need , and a comfortable living_area .
M	i thought the service was so good i wrote this review - my first ever !!
F	don_'_t think i will be buying clothes again
M	i have mailed them but i '_m not sure if i just killed the order dead as there '_s no way to revert that action .
F	!
M	never again !!
F	thanks you it kept my mind at rest .
M	i also wanted a slow_puncture repaired under their free offer but unfortunately they had run out of patches . so have to go back later in the week .
M	good customer service , and easy to use .
F	sorted next_day .
M	grammatical errors with regards one of the logos , slow service .
M	unfortunately the shower was not included .
M	other than that the communications went fine and everything arrived intact and on time .
F	however i have two cewe_books that have the wow_factor and the price was also similar .
F	anyone that is considering taking up the higher offer from bozowi should most definitely read all reviews first , i didn_'_t and it caused me more stressed than actually needed .
M	dear luke
F	i would reccomend to anyone_wanting to sell their phone , no_hassle everything is so straight_forward .
F	fantastic product .
M	good shop , very slow send system , 0days are 0days .
F	after 0 week it turned_out the car and the deal advertised on the webiste was no_longer available and i was told the deal should have been removed from the webiste weeks_ago ( it is still on there today !).
M	not only that , i can '_t even log in to their system to view my booking !
M	i ordered some replacement bulbs for my christmas_lights online on 00 / 00 ; which i appreciate is near christmas .
F	not good enough .
M	well !
M	the initial order worked well and i expected to receive the code within their stated 0 to 00_hours .
M	i used twice the service of booking . com and from customers point of view all was good .
M	myprotein sold stuff with nothing added or taken_away but its not so now .
F	outrageous price for 0 pages of photocopied paper ( both_sides granted .)
M	so my opinion of dfds is tainted by my experience of what happens when things go_wrong and in my view the company needs to learn lessons and have contingency plans for when things do not go to plan .
F	good value for money ill definitely shop_here again
M	vfm , quick delivery and good comms .
F	we had travelled a fair distance and in order to see the show , had to purchase completely new tickets costing a further £_000 . 00 .
F	most_recent_purchase was an absolutely_beautiful mulberry_silk throw in taupe .
F	it '_s really unfair to make us wait to the very last_minute and get so stressed out about it .
F	i ordered online one the monday_evening .
M	ordered product which was showing in stock .
F	it means you have to watch the traffic entering the airport and wave to the driver to catch his / her eye when you have identified your vehicle .
M	there is even a tracking_system in operation .
F	thank_you .
M	i speak from experience , and not a good one !
F	the e_- mail '_s they send are no - reply and the phone number you call is permanently_engaged , hence another £ 0 . 00 added to my bill .
F	paid the deposit which i was told would hold the booking and they could add or takeaway people on the booking , they set_up an account so everybody could log in and pay .
F	we deliberately took the ' red_route ' bus so that we could benefit from a local guide who would hopefully educate and entertain us .
M	and again never apologised or even called / emailed
M	also the fact that customer service kept ignoring my emails was really frustrating .
M	in the end i got fed_up waiting and just asked for my money back , however they have so_far been unable to do this .
M	have filed a charge back with my credit_card provider as they refused to cancel the ticket despite their own terms and conditions stating that they would if they had to change the flight on me .
F	had finished a phone_call where the conclusion was that i was to send back the unused tickets for a full_refund ( minus £_00 in charges ) only to be phoned back saying that was a mistake , and it would be a total of £_00 charges , along with me buying new tickets .
M	top_class service .
F	my item arrived faulty and was not refunded .
M	the car and staff were good but the rental_agreement included a full_tank of petrol ( probably for a range_rover - it doesn_'_t take € 00 to fill a polo ) with the instruction to bring the car back as close to empty as possible - needless to say we hadn_'_t gone to portugal on a driving holiday and the car had half a tank when returned - a profit of € 00 for guerin .
M	it wasn_'_t until we went to breakfast room that we were told by the gender confused man that we had continental breakfast included , not full english , it would have cost an extra £_00 per head .
M	on the website it states that if any item was not in stock then the customer would be emailed to let them know .
F	have used before and would certainly use again .
M	cheaper and most of the time next_day delivery
F	my 0 year_old daughter couldn_'_t even get it on - it was ridiculously small .
M	good service , great price , helpful staff .
M	if buying a house i suggest going with a totally independent solicitor
F	some explanation would be appreciated
F	the item was in stock and was delivered promptly at a good price , definitely be using this site again .
F	ordered items , soon arrived , applied to my cats , a very easy and happy experience will buy again from this company !
F	i ordered it at lunchtime on the monday and it had been delivered by tuesday_morning .
F	at first it was like a dream when whiz zing through the pound coins but unfortunately found it wasn_'_t brilliant on the smaller value coins and after manual checks found it was missing one or two 0ps or 0ps .
F	excellent service !
F	the blinds arrived quickly and we ' re easy to put up .
M	what more could you ask for ?
M	at the end of the day i had to email them and inquire_about the order .
F	luckily , others were there who had also been told to meet the same seller here to receive their tickets so we tried to contact the man who had arranged to meet us .
F	the website shouldn_'_t guarantee or promise products and not deliver them .
M	now how good is that ?
F	advised them that i had booked week of 00 / 00 off work as holidays needed to be submitted due to christmas and told there was nothing they could do about it i '_m not entitled to compensation , can not cancel the order and only_thing they could suggest was to ask someone_else to wait in for it !
F	was kept_informed by text and was able to track my order from 0am on morning of delivery and was kept up to date with the time slots .
F	with all the extra costs it ended_up being so much more .
M	i was able to listen to the audio_equipment without_any pressure at all .
M	when i asked the receptionist about this paper she explained that the printspace did not use it .
F	use an_alternative supplier .
M	what annoyed me the most was advertising items on their website which can be delivered by a certain date but cannot follow this through because the item are not in stock ??
F	this was very embarrassing and i had to apologise to my friends and buy them another gift .
F	after a talk to a financial_advisor at our regular bank , we kept adam informed and waited to get quotes for the annuity .
M	recommended to protect_your precious instruments from knocks and blows .
F	this has happened 0 or 0 times and now if not dispatched in the time it states i just cancel and try and find the product elsewhere even if i have to spend a few more pounds .
M	many_thanks , fast delivery goods spot on price good i will use you again and recomend you to freinds .
F	my order arrived in record_time .
M	took it back to shop .
F	first my credit_card did not do through due to incorrect billing_address .
F	the jiffy_bag had burst_open at the end and the goods arrived with a postman '_s rubber_band around them .
M	the gadget / device must turn on and off
M	won_'_t be using them again
F	good communication .
M	not what you want on a six month anniversary and also valentines_day !
M	taking the time to get back to a customer review shows a genuine wish to meet customer needs and keep us happy .
M	this is the first time i have used lindy and i have been very impressed by the value for money and sppedy delivery of the goods .
M	when i pointed_out that their technical_issues didn_'_t stop them taking money from people i was told i was being abusive and that they were ending the call .
M	one click ordering with payment details stored so no need for form_filling .
F	i tell my friends to come onto the site and have a good look
M	to your gp you ' re now ' under the care ' of a specialist consultant so observation / monitoring is not their problem .
M	!
F	ordered fitflop ballerina for half price !!
F	my order arrived very quickly and well_packaged .
M	ordered the otho pen and arrived as usual in quick time but the refill jammed and wouldn_'_t retract .
F	plymouth
M	yes an error has_been made and in case you did not understand i will clarify the situation once again .
M	peter
M	.
M	they have a power that belies their size and the trigger activated led '_s are really handy in those dark recesses .
M	not a very professional sales_team dont seem to know what there talking_about quite often , dont_know exactly when items will shipped and never carry all stock in all options with protein supplements often dont have all flavours .
F	i didn_'_t receive the size i ordered then the size i ordered wasn_'_t available which was rather annoying .
F	i would recommend them to everyone .
F	the machines were time critical and would arrive too late for us so we phoned dell to enquire why they had misleading delivery times showing on their web_site .
F	to the packaging and the quality of the items .
F	prestige_flowers have blamed royal_mail but still cant tell me where my flowers are . was advised they could send another bouquet and a £ 0 . 00 voucher fpr next time !
M	assume that i won_'_t .
F	elly
M	what an embarrassing low quality service .
M	probably one of the best lenders out there , although the rates are a bit high , as are all payday_loans but , this is better_than most .
M	the item came guess_what 0 parts faulty no surprise there then .
M	piad for but didnt arrive for a few_days ( fair_enough ) when they did arrive , they were in a jiffy envelope saying signed for but unfortunately they did not attempt to get a signature but instead rammed them through what is a tiny letterbox causing them to break .
M	shortly_after this i received an e_- mail from gumtree saying this guy was a suspected fraudster so don_'_t take this further .
F	when i contacted customer service they said it does not come with instructions and i should contact a plummer .
F	would recommend you to all my friends .
F	after shopping around for a north_face coat for my son , e_- outdoor had the best price and also free delivery and i was very pleased to learn that this was next_day delivery .
M	after typing my message for the card and confirming by order i realised i had not put the name of who it was going to .
M	dreadful !!!!
F	thank_you !
M	we cooperated at every opportunity sending photographs and video_footage of the damage a shame customer service did not do the same .
M	so fare so good was accepted on 00 / 00 /_0000 not had my first payment go out yet but if they say i will be deat free in 0 years by paying £_000 a month for £ 00000 that '_s got to be good .
F	i '_m writing this an_hour after asking her to contact the depot and let_me know where the parcel is but she hasn_'_t called back .
M	or half board , which can make a big_difference price wise .
M	i would heartily_recommend e_- outdoor to anyone .
F	the flowers were delivered by yodel - it wasn_'_t mentioned when ordering that flowers would be sent by courier so the delivery experience wasn_'_t as special .
M	had i raised the issue immediatley on delivery the response may have been better .
F	[ 00 . 000 . 00 . 000 ].
F	goods arrived on time .
M	they were the same price as amazon and even offered interest free credit .
M	so let_me start by saying that my product did arrive and it was in good condition .
F	would definitely recommend great gardens online to anyone and will for sure be ordering from them again myself .
M	i checked the details online and was about to book online .
F	add terrible customer service to the mix and insurance that appears worthless judging_by the other reviews and all in all , i expect them cpw to collapse very soon if this is how they treat customers .
M	they therefore helpfully offered to redeliver it on monday when i was at work 00 miles_away .
F	update no promised call_backs and not surprisingly still no cheques !!!
M	would encourage people to use this service .
F	but the transporter said he was struggling to find my address and after more than a week - and because i did call the transporter today to complain !- i got it !
F	had another delivery today and everything is fine , am really pleased with my order and i would recommend crocus to friends and family , in fact i already have , lol .
F	however they have opened very quickly and i did expect a few more stems .
M	apparently he was only there to give a rough_estimate and that the proper measurements will need to be taken ?
M	after hours of multiple calls - each new call starting the whole_process over again - i was getting_nowhere .
F	a goodwin
F	i am going to inform wilkinsons their contract with yodel should be terminated and will report them to watchdog .
M	have been advised it would be delivered 00 / 00 / 00 between_0am - 0pm .
M	i am so happy with the results and after 00 + years of wearing_glasses it was fantastic to find freedom at last .
M	highly_commended .
M	went on line found good price it couldnt of been any easyer
M	they are selling brackets for £_00 /£ 00 /£ 00 & £_000 then sending brackets that are priced at £_00 on their website .
F	i informed tapsuk immediately and sent a photo as requested .
F	however since then nothing , obviously the two_weeks has past and i have sent two emails and i am still none the wiser .
F	webuybooks is just brilliant !
F	i would use again .
M	you can '_t even auto - renew your package . you have to log on each_month and order it again .
F	i was very dissapointed on both_occasions and think that this needs sorting as it has made me think_twice about ordering from you again .
M	did not realize until pushing the button that i could have specified upgraded photo_paper .
M	i have recently signed_up for wowcher , as i saw a good deal and thought why not ?
M	i used to send loads through tge , they were great , reliable and very cheap .
M	lots of happy memories .
M	both chairs were the same and each was self - assembly .
M	i have delt_with tooled_up for work and now home .
M	although they probably will be glad never to have me buy from them again , i would recommend them to anyone ; great prices and first_class service .
M	giving a 0_star_review on here sorted my problem out almost_instantly .
F	beyond_belief !
M	thanks again
M	all they do is lie and when you call back they pretend it never happened .
F	i ordered a mixed pack of products of exante , which was sent out very promptly !
F	serenataflowers delivered a beautiful_bouquet of flowers and box of chocolates to my mum and dad for their anniversary .
M	each year i make an a0 book , prior to which i make one or more small booklets using the same material , to ensure that i have correctly adjusted the image densities .
M	could have been better informed and at the stage where something could have been done about damaged goods or goods out of stock , and / or late deliveries !
M	i have been asked to write a revue about my experience with key_solutions and this has to be one of the easiest tasks i been requested to do .
F	the flowers arrived on time as requested but was alittle
M	their stock is invariably at variance with the data on their computer ( in every branch i '_ve ever been in to ).
F	i guess victoria_plumb requested that .
F	it is everything it should be .
F	basically they are making up new rules as they go along to get money out of customers .
F	the highlands and islands are a distince and well defined area .
F	the quality of the product was excellent ( to be expected ).
M	i have always found debs full of very helpful staff and excellent products .
F	perfect service with very speedy delivery and excellent value for money .
M	no email arrived , so i sent a message , via the website , to customer service to check whether my order was ok .
M	well informed_throughout the buying and delivery process with emails_telling you exactly_what '_s happening and where your product is .
F	very , very pleased i used age_partnership to arrange my pension_annuity .
M	the milton_keynes shop said they would deliver the furniture and put it in any room we wanted but this is not the case for heavy items such as wardrobes , when they arrived with the oak_furniture they said they would have to arrange another delivery date for a 0 man team to carry the furniture .
F	thanks
M	when i first tried to cancel , they begged me not to saying they would be able to send my " camera " within a week .
M	no issues with garden_xl or delivery .
M	i called the head_office to see whats_happening with my case and i was told that its registered as a complaint and if i wanted them to investigate then i should have told them , after that they took my details and the manager of the local asda called to say sorry . i sent an email after that but i guess its case dismissed .
F	i ordered and had my flowers delivered in november_0000 , never received a confirmation_email but the flowers got to the person on time .
F	purchased 0 mirrored_bedside_cabinets and i was a little_worried they wouldn_'_t be very good quality with the price being so low , however they are gorgeous !!
M	it makes no sense to have a registered office address where the public can just find out where you live from the services address .
F	had cheek to charge me for broadband and then forgot to set it up !!!!
M	lastly i was not pleased to find myself charged 00_euros for a full_tank of petrol .
F	delivery finally on monday midday , which we rejected as obviously not needed .
M	i called viovet .
F	apart_from that they would appear to be as advertised .
F	regards
M	was a little annoyed that the enclosed_instructions recommended to bypass the ballast for maximum energy_saving as product description didn_'_t mention this ( paid alot more for this to avoid having to do that !
M	sadly that is no_longer the case , they now have a central call_centre which is very frustrating to use at best , bordering on intolerable at worst .
M	will use again !
M	most unsatisfactory .
F	i ordered 0 bouquets to be delivered on 00 dec . only one was delivered on 00rd .
M	i have placed a number of orders with music_magpie ( mm ) recently & here ’_s my experience .
M	quick , easy , price as promised , perfect
F	take warning prospective buyer that there is no chance to contact the company by telephone and any email sent recieves no reply or response should you receive poor service .
M	i have been using the asda grocery delivery service for the last_year as my local asda is miles_away and as i do monthly grocery_shopping , found it a convenient solution to long shopping excursions with limited time .
F	no wonder they charge delivery at £ 0 . 00 for a purchase of £ 0 . 00 !
M	we thought they had , only to get to heathrow and find that two of our party of four did not even have the correct visas arranged through travel_nation even_though they had confirmed and taken our money .
M	been waiting over 0_weeks now for the money to arrive .
M	and agreeing delivery dates and times , the goods actually arrived earlier_than_expected , preceded_by a phone_call from the driver .
M	although i only compared the certain products i was buying , i bet this is true for a large variety of items on their site .
M	first_class service !
M	i have bought bouquets from morrisons for a quarter of the price that have lasted four times longer before dying .
F	would use this company again & recommend them to other dog / cat owners .
M	on - line search found product easily and ordering was simple and straightforward , even as a new customer .
F	here is my story .
F	!
F	yes when i looked now at my booking confirmation whole on the screen i see the mistake but it was an honest mistake and to be charged an extra £_00 seems very unreasonable .
M	supplements are good and at reasonable prices however the free delivery is terrible .
M	sportsbikeshop were just brilliant .
M	i returned the item and within a few_days was sent a full_refund , great service .
M	purchased some window rubbers and employed a glass fitting company to fit the windows with the rubbers from just_kampers .
M	thank_you bedfordshire_bbq centre !
F	i have used before and they have been quite good however this time i left strict_instructions as the person receiving the flowers was an older lady_who cannot answer the door quickly .
F	i '_ve been trying to top up my father - in - law '_s mobile with a voucher .
M	believe me , they wont be contacting you .
M	as been disabled its hard to be here to get deliveries . still no delivery , now 00 / 00 /_0000 @ 00 . 00_hrs . well now 00 / 00 /_0000 and still no delivery , i '_m getting my payment refunded in 0 to 0 working_days but they get it out of the bank in two_days , i ; m just waiting now to see if it goes into my account by the 00 / 00 /_0000 . well got the refund in my account today 00 / 00 /_0000 . but i still won_'_t use pet - supermarket ever again , plus my friends said they won_'_t either . well still no delivery of my goods as told earlier there was no tracking for my goods if it had been posted it should still arrive at sometime , but told pet - supermarket if it does arrive i will return it to them 00 / 00 /_0000 . still no delivery , but got the refund on 00 / 00 /_0000 .
M	i ordered a tin of por engine_enamel and it was delivered very quickly , as usual .
M	good communication .
F	i contacted mountrose who the table was supplied from and they said to contact wowcher direct .
M	told us when we were collecting our baggage that they would be 00_mins and turned_up 00_mins after we got outside , all seemed ok until we drove_away then noticed the mud on the floor drivers_side and arm rests and door panels inside .
M	really easy to do and process ,
M	the service was reasonably_priced and the driver was there on time .
F	email after email arrived , threatening to cancel the order , which they did , while all the time they had received my £_00 vets prescription !
F	one niggle - we were told by the salesman that they only had one sale per year and that we were getting a bargain !
F	tried to use it but it just don_'_t suit me .
F	he helped fast track the divorce through the courts and i am sure stuart went the extra_mile for us because of my partner ’_s illness and we cannot thank him enough .
M	checked online and says delivered to number 0 .
F	i '_ve_used this service twice , and can '_t fault the website / service .
M	i said that i would be out for 0 hours the following_day , but the synth had already gone out .
M	they were ' nt pushy and are very helpful , along with the fact that the phone is unlocked and can be used with any network .
M	a well finished pleasing light oak finish , with carefully supported adjustable shelves . it goes beautifully with our new carpet . a faultless bookcase .
M	they can '_t even tell you how many people are in the queue in front of you .
M	for the last 0 months i have written letters , had hugely frustrated phone - calls and am now at my wit '_s end .
M	their prices were the cheapest by a long_shot , even compared to the january sales in the high_street .
M	they give a sanitised ' corporate " response which is based on the customer is always wrong .
F	we seriously regret placing business with them a 0rd time .
M	no one will talk or communicate with me to obtain money back for the difference in delivery costs , which is approx_£_00 . 00
F	ring customer_services with the last 00p credit , the automated selection ( choose 0 , choose 0 etc ) takes me in another loop , then says no credit remaining , thanks for ringing , goodbye .
M	because vodafone ignored my request to stop marketing . vodafone broke so many rules .
M	scared the wife , scared the kids , but when i tried to report the guy to talktalk , they claimed they had no way of knowing who was working where !
F	if this is indeed the truth company policy should be changed to stop the doubts in my mind that a very poor job had been done !
F	this was just after 0pm and the women said that camilla , who would be dealing_with my claim , was out of the office .
F	i '_m not sure_whether they are the cheapest option or not , but surely the revenue in having to give refunds due to their lack of courtesy and care , as well as navigation is costly enough to stop using these delinquents to deliver goods .
M	ordered a couple of bottles of vodka expecting delivery to be post christmas or even after new year ( which wouldn_'_t have been a problem ).
M	essentially this company has stolen £_00 from me .
M	i '_ve also emaild the info emial adrress about the missing plug but i '_ve not heard_anything either .
M	the company phoned on the morning to reassure me of the timings and jeremy from newcastle arrived on time to fit the tyres .
F	\ it may be the fault of my phone rather_than the battery ?
F	perhaps more of the cost went on the speedy delivery than on the content of the bouquet .
M	phil .
F	the hi vis body warmers were a mish - mash of different brands .
F	they cannot find out when any delivery is next due , it just arrives and then they can contact us .
F	the website should clearly state if there is a wait or goods are not available at the current time .
F	horrible !
F	very down to earth , knowledgeable and not pushy like some salesmen can be .
M	i have not received enough spikes and the spikes aren_'_t long enough to fit in the boots
M	i will_certainly deal with gizzmoheaven again and i recommend them to anyone looking for electronic bits and pieces .
M	fast delivery .
M	again , found the special dog diet_food cheapest on the web .
F	the delivery was fast and the item arrived_safely .
M	during the recent snowy_weather i suddenly realised that i needed a new snow shovel , i ordered it late one afternoon from tooled_- up and thirty - six hours_later i was using it to clear snow from my drive .
M	i saw cars in better condition ( opel_corsa , fiat_000 ) fom the same company running about - did i get the dud car of the week ?
M	went to the store saturday as i had heard_nothing for 0 days .
F	( in my opinion )
F	what would have killed me first the carbon_monoxide or the failing brakes ?
F	i tried three different ones just to make_sure i wasn_'_t just disliking one flavour but the consistency and the and taste is just unpleasant .
F	if this was stated before hand i would have had a chance to decide for myself .
F	i have fitted the deluxe 000 anti_scratch soft_close with no problem as it had instructions .
F	i found the outfit i ordered from your website very good quality for the price and i will be ordering more stuff in the weeks to come plus recommending you to all my friends
F	i '_m really glad i chose them for my lifetime_mortgage .
F	however , they appear to have changed delivery provider and now use yodel , who are awful .
M	not feeling very valued .
M	speedy delivery .
F	really good site .
F	as an academic music tutor , i have found a good quantity of work through this website , particularly a - level students .
M	i have suggested to the company that they need to change their courier ( fed_ex ) so as to ensure that they meet their customer '_s expectations .
F	would definitely use again and reccomend to others .
F	ideal_location for touring yorkshire and next door to the show at newby hall that weekend .
M	easy and quick !
F	it doesn_'_t give you much detail and you need to know the make of the vehicle you ' re checking .
F	overall service and information updates excellent .
M	easy to find the product i wanted with full details .
F	it was easy to go through the memory selection and ordering process .
F	i have sent an_email_saying that if i do not recieve an_email_saying they have been dispatched by the 00th_sept then i will be requesting for a full_refund and putting in a formal_complaint !
F	i saw the advert on group on for personalised mugs and decided i would like to buy 0 of them , however buying them was a bit of a pain as i had to purchase a group on voucher for 0 . and 0 . i then had to place this as 0 separate_orders on the jessops web_site which_meant i had 0 delivery fees despite al the mugs arriving at the sae time from the one delivery man so seemed a bit of a con and could have been simplified greatly had i been able to order 0 mugs in one order and enter both vouchers at the same time .
F	great seats and great service with recent tickets to see paloma at liverpool empire .
F	apologised_profusely and dealt_with it all .
F	phoned up for my order as it is always nice to speak to some - one
F	i was anoyed on the day of delivery when the company delivering texted to say someone must be at home to receive the order .
F	i ordered on sunday_night and it arrived today -- rather quick for clothes that are imported !
M	very easy and complete booking service , all the information anyone needs to make an informed_decision and the right decision .
M	no mention of a start date is given until the end of the process !
F	i am not sure how long the trim will stay in the groove it is put in as it is not fixed there with adhesive so doesn_'_t seem secure .
F	i was told to sort it myself with the delivery company when they called me , a call i am expecting this week .
M	avoid these_people .
M	i placed an order early november for delivery on 00th and it was delivered on time .
M	that one star is only there because the trustpilot will not accept no stars .
F	they have some nice stuff because i '_ve bought a jumper there that looked lovely and also a pair of shorts aswell as basics but even these i could buy cheaper elsewhere at the same quality .
M	good communication .
M	moreso he checked the car and , even_though i had ordered a full set of tyres as advised by my service mechanic , informed me that i only needed one tyre .
F	we have used mattress man 0 times_now and totally recommend them .
F	there was no size given on the website to enable a choice to be made , only descriptions ' standard ', ' large ' etc .
F	i was notified of all_stages of the processing and delivery via_email .
F	although i chose a very basic package as wanted to market the property myself but have the internet exposure .
M	then found out fedex had delivered it to the wrong street .
M	firstly , my original delivery was scheduled for an afternoon slot , and when i asked if there was any chance it could be changed to a morning slot , customer_services said no .
M	tristan
F	bought a rug for our childrens playroom .
M	it seems the instructions , though in english ) and intended for the usa or mainland_europe where the drivers_side is on the left .
F	when i spoke to the ' live_chat advisor ' she told me that i had signed_up for a platinum account !!
M	next_day delivery is a joke .
M	cdkeys . com : order approval 00000000000
F	so … overall i ’_m really happy with the goods but i have reservations_about using drinks_direct again purely_because of the city_link incident ( i know it ’_s not drinks_direct fault but this isn_’_t the first complaint on here about the courier and i ’_m_sure it won ’_t be the last !)
M	easy to use site .
F	i contacted city_link they appologied then said they would re - collect the parcels and deliver them to the correct destination .
M	it was clear that at some point the box had been impacted as the box was torn & taped_up with clear tape .
M	wanted to upgrade from 0 gb to 0 gb . hunted round .
M	i would like to thank_you for the experience but if i want to go back to amsterdam ill fly
F	was disappointed with the service .
F	much_cheaper_than the vets and delivery was swift .
M	i '_ve been waiting now over 0_weeks for a product that i asked for next_day delivery .
M	will_definately_use this company again .
M	finances are always of a great concern to me and having this company refusing to close my account / issue a bill is slowly driving me to the edge .
M	on 00th , based on your mail sent on 00th of apr i was supposed to pick_up the car at 00 : 00 from europcar , as per your e_- mail information .
M	there was also no information of the method used to remove the caffeine which influences my choices .
F	also if delays and you change your mind they charge a restocking_fee .
F	i would definitely recommend their products and services to friends and family .
F	this also happened to our friends which_meant we both had to call the customer service , look for our documents to give the reference_number .
M	there was very good communication from the company and i was very happy with the quality of the item i ordered .
M	the tech 000 response is a lie do not trust this outfit .
F	i didnt and there was nothing sayin i had .
F	will definitely be using the whiskey_exchange in the future !
F	real customer service .
F	i wish i '_d gone somewhere_else as i am now going to have to move my business elsewhere to a company that actually serves uk customers !
M	i waited all day and night , nothing !
M	the small burner on the £_00 . 00 kit does not work properly , the charcol does not burn as required .
F	so i have made 0 complaints via phone and internet chat and now an_email .
F	eventually she spotted a rather nice bouquet in the window of a house three down from her and thought she would call on the off - chance .
M	great pair of shoes from ecco .
M	had a beko_washing_machine before worked well and this one is no different ,
F	all we need now is some sunshine !
M	however , beyond wit of ' courier ' driver to deliver . so delivery promised next_day and eflorist refunded my same day delivery fee .
F	i had been searching on - line for a new grey coloured bbq_cover for the spectrum 0 flatbed bbq and sourced one on the riverside_garden_centre '_s website - the colour was clearly grey in the pictures .
M	worst customer service ever !!
M	there are some shops : butcher , baker and supermarket within walking_distance as well as a couple of bars and restaurants .
F	all in all we had a great trip , fab boat , lovely food and excellent entertainment .
F	having_searched_everywhere for the spices i needed in my local_shops but to no_avail , i thankfully came_across healthysupplies online and was amazed_at the prices and choices ( i looked at an awful_lot of other_sites , talk about steep prices !!)
F	we never had these problems with bookings made directly through dfdseaways but we were forced to use directferries this time .
F	i was disappointed that you did not have the stock level you stated on your website .
F	i have to say the admin_team and lorraine in particular were brilliant , answered all my questions / emails promptly .
F	so , all in all a great shopping_experience !
M	it has_been a real_pleasure in dealing_with nationwide_vehicle contracts .
F	the initial booking process was simple and easy until trying to add the card_details to make the payment .
M	thanks again for sharing ."
F	sincere thank_you for making good on my initially poor experience .
F	refused and had to pay for drinks at bar , had just paid when we were then shown to a table .
F	they also trade on ebay and on viewing the feedback there , which i wish i had before purchasing anything from this so called company , there is alot of negative_feedback which just confirms my experience , no goods , no refund , extra costs . buyers_beware .
F	since_discovering them i have had new glasses , sunglasses and now order my contact_lenses with them , all at brilliant prices . i '_ve also recommended them to friends and family !!!
M	they make it as difficult as possible to complain and when you do , it '_s unlikely you '_ll receive a response .
F	i waited excitedly for my vivienne_westwood jumper to arrive , it was everything i expected and more , it came in a lovely red gift box and wrapped inside in quality tissue_paper , i loved the personal_touch the speed of delivery and of course the outstanding price .
F	when i said i would rather wait for the parcels to be located even if it took longer , i was told it was highly unlikely they would turn_up as they had probably been stolen !
F	my sister has had a recent_bereavement and i wanted to send her some flowers as a little surprise to help cheer_her up .
F	and an excellent price even when the postage is included . i was even offered the oportunity to have a ' reminder ' so i could re order automatically .
F	the dress was lovely and was very happy till my daughter tried it on it was really big i brought 0 - 0 my daughter been 0 but this was very big , even thought my daughter isnt that small .
M	had i been informed of this i would have cancelled my order and gone elsewhere .
M	over the last few_years i have sent 0 of my own phones and family_members have sent phones to them .
F	i '_m not buying anymore lottery tickets ( although toying with the irish one which , at the moment , is fairer to the player .)
F	no flexibility , the driver was rude and threatened to keep the goods if we didnt pay him extra .
M	delivery time given 00 . 00 to 00 . 00 delivered on time could not ask for more .
M	i like jules_b shopping online is easy and the deliveries is quick , i can tell my friends to shop on jules_b online
M	today i ordered through the website and on confirmation it said for collection .
F	i did contact the customer service team to discuss my issue along with emailing over images of the lower priced ticket , i was really disappointed that i had to chase superdry for a resolution , superdry did eventually call me back and offered the difference in price , however this has really left a back feeling .
F	before a certain time as some medications need to be started as soon as possible so the covenience of online shopping is erased if you have to wait several days
M	good price , got emails_confirming order and delivery .
F	i am_appalled by this and was not only irate when she called to tell me , but embarrassed and humiliated also .
M	i was very happy with the service provided by this company .
M	my little van now looks great and i had a call , someone got the number from my van and it paid for its self .
M	he told me that he buys all his games direct from cjs as they process orders automatically and you get your serial_number straight_away unlike_other_sites that can leave you waiting days sometimes even weeks to reply with a working serial_number .
M	fast delivery and great value !
F	!
F	do however consider the size and weight of the lens you are hiring as this needs consideration while transiting .
M	found what i was looking for , a special concealed barrel hinge , decided to buy a spare but the p_&_p was more than the hinges , no option for standard royal_mail postage .
F	a fast efficient service , and the most comfortable contact_lenses i have ever had , all for a great price .
F	!
M	this was fine as far as it went .
M	i hear the range is getting larger for christmas .
F	i know you have mentioned on the site that you trying to find a solution .
F	it kept saying i lived in a flat and i had to manually write the installation address but couldn_'_t change to other address so in a week or so we will see where my router ends up !!??
F	the response was no , they did not do old parts but could let_me have a reframe at a reduced price of £_00 ( which i declined .)
M	my flowers arrived with no ballon and only 00 roses so i never got my money worth apart_from that my girlfriend liked them and very good delivery
M	however the actual experience was deeply disappointing .
M	i was charged by carhire0000 on 00th_november and have yet to receive a refund .
F	bought memory for two laptop computers .
F	you get what you pay for .
M	good product and couldn_'_t fault service , right down to choosing delivery dates .
M	the price was the cheapest found online and the ease in ordering and delivery was great .
M	thanks for making the extra effort .
M	while i have no strong opinion about tool - stop i was very unhappy with the courier service they use .
M	unfortunately as yet , ( weeks have become months ). no answer !
F	good products fast delivery
F	never had such good service dont_think i will buy my electricals anywhere_else ever again
M	the whole_thing appears to be a scam operation and i have no idea why o0 have teamed_up with such an outragous bunch on con_artists .
F	the shoes were a good price and they were delivered quickly .
F	on this basis i would not order again as i did not like the alternative flower composition .
F	changed the tyres without a hitch , no_complaints at all about his service , but by the time he finished it was too late to go to the post_office for an important parcel .
F	i took our a 00 month_contract with a blackberry_bold 0000 0_weeks_ago the phone stopped_working i took it back to my nearest_store sent it off for repairs and a week_later was contacted to say that the phone couldn_'_t be fixed and because it was under_warranty ( great i thought ) i was legible for a brand_new phone , i took away what i thought was a ' brand_new ' phone of the same model i had previous , to find out that it is infact a re - cycled phone where somebody at some point in time has had the phone previously to me so deffinately not ' brand_new '!
M	the first pair ( transitions_lenses in a half frame ) fell_apart in under 0 days .
M	printerland customer_services have been top_notch too .
M	i have no_complaints on the service provided in terms of packaging , delivery and customer service .
F	i would also like to point out in this review that i have a disabled relative who also uses sainsbury '_s in a number of stores across the country ( mainly as i live in essex and she is in shropshire ) we have never had an issue borrowing any form of wheelchair or acquiring goods from the top shelf at any of the 0 stores we regularly use , they also have ramps for the cash machines and a lower machine for wheelchair access .
M	excellent repairs service - didn_'_t cost me a penny to have specs ' arm reattached after 0 years !
F	a frustrating 00mins - to & fro , being refused name of a manager etc , i was eventually told that i had to meet the ticket seller at the venue to get my ticket .
F	i have already_passed on company info to friends .
M	i found pharmplexdirect online after viovets had put up the cost of the tablets i needed by 00 %.
M	the very best service i have experienced .
F	great service
F	great choice of fonts / colours / patterns etc .
F	he was told that i would receive an_email the next_day asking me to confirm my bank details so that the money could be transferred to me .
F	there service was very good , but hte quaily of the flowers did not rate as to how good the service was .
F	fantastic speedy delivery - items exactly as_described - excellent product - what '_s not to like ?
M	would definitely use them again .
M	i canceled it , as i needed it at a specific date .
F	they did !
M	at this point i can '_t really say if i am going to buy anything from this website .
M	thankyou villa_plus for a fantastic week away .
M	the disappointment this time is delivery though .
F	thank_you for a great product & great service .
M	the search_feature is next to useless .
F	needed hoovering but potentially very nice .
F	quality of the goods are excellent . carriage is very reasonably_priced and the after service good .
F	i purchased a coffee and side table which took almost 0_weeks to be delivered although they took payment the minute the order was placed .
M	called jl and they advised me store had stock and would price match ( never_knowingly undersold my ar $ e !
M	when leaving t - mobile i was told i didn_'_t need to give notice to leave .
F	you said i could add it to his drinking_water .
M	wish i ' d looked here and read their ridiculous terms and conditions before ordering .
M	excellent .
M	they would not talk to me on the phone - a lady_called lynne fletcher who is the renewals manager : tel : 00000000000 refused to speak to me , leaving her subordinate under her direction to inform_me to fill in their online complaints form ( which is worrying that they would need one anyway !!!)
F	took it straight to the parking office , they said this shouldn_'_t happen but often does , advised me to take my ticket and booking sheet back to office on my return to edinburgh the next_day .
F	last_minute . com promise a refund within a few_days if you find the hotel cheaper else where !
F	if you spend over_£_00 . 00 delivery is free and goods usually arrive next_day .
M	lately though it seems the network_coverage is not so great
F	next time i update to a new phone i will_definately sent my old phone to mazuma .
M	i left an honest appraisal of the company on here and was shocked to find my review had been taken off as it had been reported as false .
M	out of 00 . 0 / 00 service 0 / 00 for product
F	frank answered all my questions and sent me the tracking_details for my parcel which arrived very quickly and great care had been taken in the packaging so in excellent condition .
M	the first time you need to be careful to set it up correctly ( you getting used to the system ), but after that it is easy and works well and transfer is fast .
F	it would take 00_minutes .
F	they refuse to give any discounts or money off even_though it was 000_% their error .
F	redhill appliances seem to be brilliant , when they have things in stock , but the worst when it is out of stock , they just take your money and then don_'_t care and take ages to refund you .
F	first time using this company .
F	i certainly hope i never have to contact customer_care again , as they are rather useless .
F	i ordered what i was lead to believe a very expensive ( full price was just under_£_00 ) flower_arrangement for my mum for mothers_day , this arrived partly dead and was very small and the flowers which i was lead to believe would be included were not , it was full of cheap carnations .
F	sam was a pleasure working with and when i accidentally provided the wrong number he helped_me correct the mistake and get the funds transferred quick !
M	another story of getting carried away with yourself and biting the hand that feeds you .
M	so yes tyreleader , great if you have tyre leavers .
F	order placed on a tuesday , received a phone_call after about 0 hours to arrange delivery and was given the option of thursday or friday .
M	not really firefly '_s fault i suppose - more the design of nice airport '_s roads - but worth bearing in mind .
M	i had to make a couple of changes to my order due to an error on my part .
M	any data used on an unbilled period is carried over to the next period even_though your contract is for a set period - in essence they ' double charge ' you this data & usage .
F	would definately use this website again .
M	also their prices seem to be consistently better_than their competitors who i have never used because i never needed too .
M	!
M	fast efficient service .
F	the skirt is lovely & i had planned on buying it in another colour .
M	time will tell .
M	walked to store to be faced with clueless ' we don_'_t stock that ' response .
M	i ordered a velux_blackout_blind .
F	lee could not complete the works as booked and was most apologetic – i completed his paperwork accordingly before he departed .
F	nealry three_weeks and i still_haven_'_t received my order of one printed mug .
M	i would definitely use them again .
F	thank_you for an amazing holiday !
M	always makes me think their own staff write those reviews !
F	e . g .
M	the cassette works great and i will_definitely be using flat out cycles again !!
F	!
F	they are reliable and easy to use and good value for money .
M	great price and fast delivery .
F	i may just use hat and bow_tie on the night .
M	requested a roof_box key and provided all the information but it wasn_'_t a correct fit and they couldn_'_t supply it .
M	so when i needed to return the items i bought bathroom and showers_direct applied the letter of the law - and charged a completely pointless 00_% ' restocking ' charge .
M	i ordered an alarm_clock for my grandaughter '_s birthday_present through amazon .
F	even cheaper that the fitflops own website .
F	thanks
F	paid for packing and was disappointed with how shoddy it was on this occassion - acknowledge that if done well and properly , would be quite nice .
M	chat box popped up on several_occasions , but no one replied , and we could not shut it down or move it away from the centre of the screen , so could not read what was on screen behind it .
F	very very disappointed .
F	we are so pleased with our purchase !
M	the range of headphones on offer is vast and the knowledge offered by hifi_headphones staff is just as big .
F	they look amazing and fit so well with our decor .
F	great website , easy to use .
F	die_lieferung sollte vor zwei wochen zugestellt werden , wurde aber bisher noch nicht erhalten .
F	hope they will_continue maintaining these obviously high_standards to their customers .
M	information on them can be found around the internet as you will easily pick_up and be able to build a picture about them .
M	i will be more specific next time .
F	easy way to order , fast delivery
F	it appears that not only do dell show misleading delivery dates on their web_site they are also an administrative shambles .
F	i accidentally gave the wrong prescription when i first ordered the glasses , but managed to return them with no_fuss , and had another pair sent out - which are both the right prescription and fantastic .
M	0 .
M	everything you want , prices are good and the delivery service is excellent .
M	picture looks great .
F	even_though i had booked and paid for the rental in_advance , when i arrived at gatwick there was no car for me .
F	their delivery to my address was super quick .
M	i '_ve_used shopto many_times , and everytime the quality of service has_been superb .
M	on a motorway that would take a car about an_hour and a half .
F	a truly tremendous service which outshines all the rest !
M	great place , in good spot with nice night club , everyone seen friendly , cheap would be wonderful if the materass were bit more comfortable anyway i will suggest to anyone
F	i am making a fuss about nothing apparently .
F	i ordered some flowers a romantic gesture for my other half to cheer_her up .
F	it was also really well_packaged when it was returned .
F	not even a promise that in future you will bother to inform us if there is a problem .
F	it is false_advertising .
M	having had a bad_experience with an on = line agent in the past i was a little_apprehensive , but the way in which the first viewing was handled . via_text just worked_brilliantly .
F	the automated phone system is designed to make it as hard as possible to speak to a human unless you want to buy something .
M	0 .
M	left fu three_months_ago , they still have not sent me a correct final_bill and insist on sending incorrect monthly_bills with bizarre readings .
M	having said that we got a good car for our money and the online booking and follow - ups were efficient although i could have done without the persistent nagging about taking up their excess_insurance .
M	problems started the moment i opened my account and have persisted throughout .
F	many_thanks for helping a 00 year_old who is not that savvy with computers .
M	.
M	the six large gerberas pictured were replaced with two mini - heads .
F	good easy to use and fast service .
M	sold item on ebay bough delivery with interpacel two_days late picking it up only going 000_miles down the road 00 days_later got email_saying item is lost no money back no help nothing
F	this company is great to sell your things too if they will take them .
M	i could not then find the booking on the airline website .
M	when several of the guests commented on how smart my son looked in his outfit , i was happy to tell them where we had bought it and what good servcie we had received .
M	when agreement between payment sense and us was made - they say : no rolling_contract and hidden_fees , standard payment all the time which was agreed over the phone , free cancellation any day or time .
M	simply - there is too much to do within the timeframe allowed .
M	the run up to the stag_do was very good .
F	cash_generator staff where happy to rearrange postage to special delivery in time for xmas !
F	easy website to use , but not sure about delivery yet as i have on , y just started_using them
F	rebooked our customer to fit in with this plan .
F	i couldn_'_t_believe they were both here within 0_days of my order .
M	i will be using them a lot more and will be telling others about them too .
M	i simply could not trust them to send me the item .
F	why didn_'_t you tell me that in the shipping confirmation and why did you tell me it had shipped when it hadn_'_t ?
F	i would never use this companyy again .
F	i have had no replies to any emails no contact number , flowers didn_'_t turn_up , not been refunded had to go to my bank and call it back with proof of purchase .
F	plus my little_girl is now sleeping like a princess and loves her new bed :-)
M	although i was happy with iflorist for earler orders / deliveries , this latest experience has put me right off them .
M	this has taken over a month and still not resolved .
F	they got my money and did not provide the service .
M	thanks glasses0you , will be back when needed .
M	the brand is not available in the main supermarkets , so searching it out could be a right hassle , but it isnt .
F	i got a christmas_pudding outfit from mega_fancy_dress , the delivery was fast , outfit was well made and good value for money , i was impressed overall with the service and it made an impact on xmas day lol by giving my niece a scare as she didn_'_t recognise me x
F	fantastic price and very rapid delivery despite_being during the christmas holidays .
F	on the whole , i was a bit disappointed .
M	amazing delivery - slot within an_hour , fully advised and came on the dot !!!
F	love dealing_with this company , super efficient , excellent service , fabulous products and great prices .
F	wud use again .
M	i have since bought a second pipe from a different supplier which is easier to use , more realistic and much more of a pleasure to use .
M	would '_ve give 0_stars but for really slow delivery .
M	within a few minutes email from the hut saying too late as order finalised .
M	they took the money straight_away , and promised delivery next_day , the camera didn_'_t show .
M	great price
F	not ideal but i guess at_least they trying to reticfy the problem .
F	it is a very sharp knife
F	highly_recommended .
M	update to this review
F	very refreshing
M	i had made a mistake in my initial online order but they were able to correct this quickly when i phoned the next_day .
F	and i was away within 00mins .
F	i was really happy with how easy it was and that i didn_'_t need to have a new eye_test when i knew my prescription was correct and hadn_'_t changed .
M	so lots of wasted time and irritation - plus a loss of confidence in what autoglass had advised me .
F	i am greatly disappointed , especially after_reading all the great reviews on this website .
M	comms were good , and delivery was as per specified time .
F	although not cheap , the delivery arrived on time , was well_packaged ( with no_breakages ) and really good quality chocolate - thankyou !
M	the arrive return timing is confusing - the site advises you to use the actual flight arrival time , yet adds on a hour on the confirmation page - it should make this clear as i thought i ' d entered the time incorrectly and wasted time by starting again .
M	virgin took over our local cable tv network from telewest .
M	prices go up considerably very quickly , making me suspicious that they don_'_t monitor enquiries for demand rather_than purchases
M	my order with tech 000 was cancelled .
F	spoke to kwik - fit who told us they had had staffleave and no - one to cover area .
F	not a huge issue … one does not go on holiday to a sun - drenched country to watch tv .
F	order not delivered !
M	they had what i wanted , at the price i wanted to pay and they provided the high_quality service that is hinted at on thier web - site .
F	the order went through with a 0 day delivery suggested .
F	i '_m_sure it can '_t be but the smell is really off putting .
F	why , your company cannot
F	other was delivered on 00th .
M	bit_disappointing ?
M	powerbar gels came exactly as_described atr great price .
M	booking a parcel for collection and delivery was simple quick and half the price of the local post_office .
F	i '_m usually skeptical_about buying clothes online since i '_ve have problems with many sites but yesstyle is one of the few i '_d say is pretty good .
F	however , easy to navigate website !
M	bt have disconnected me after one week of using the internet from bt_infinity :/ and after apart of taking from by direct_debit 0000 gbp as cancelation charges , offered me reconnection after 0 weeeks !!!!
F	!
F	easy to order online .
F	i have placed many orders through chemist_direct from hair products to diet aids and have never been disappointed by price , availability , choice and fast service .
F	ordering was easy , the customer service representative was friendly and helpful .
F	i had to go to paypal to obtain a refund .
F	don_'_t miss this fantastic tour
F	for the country '_s national airline it does nothing to promote malta which is wonderful .
M	:(
F	nothing is in any type of order and its a nightmare to find anything .
M	also , shipping was very fast .
F	had to leave voicemail and wait call to be returned .
M	i had to return the memory before they ' d ship a new one .
F	he pulls up 0 minutes later .
F	you never get paid the cashback you are entitled too and when you contact quidco support all you ever get from them is palmed off .
F	you removed my review and asked for order confirmation before reposting .
M	i found the range available to be extremely vast and despite the fact i paid to have the items delivered in the next 0 - 0 working_days , it arrived first thing the following_morning , on a saturday .
M	the sprayer was for a worker so i '_ve had to purchase another one from a different dealership , which interestingly enough was delivered within 0 days !
F	bozowi customer_services response to this was that it is my responsibilty to make_sure my email is working and i had 0_days to accept or decline to the email i never received so it is my problem .
M	happy .
M	i was able to track my order via the company website .
M	seem quick to sell but not so quick to sort refund , which is disappointing .
F	activebeauty '_s website was easy to navigate , select & order what i required and free delivery was prompt as promised
F	this is my second order in the store .
M	eager to see if it was worth the cost , i loaded some beans in the machine and awaited the outcome .
F	the chips were no better !
F	useless .
M	i get the memory for my laptop , and everything worked great .
F	and thirdly why go telling people their tickets will be / have been destroyed when that isn_'_t true ?
F	i did send an_email with picture but sadly had no further response .
F	the range of flavours is also great , the variety helps you stick to the plan and not cheat .
M	was informed the led_lamps were out of stock which was delaying the whole order - why didn_'_t anyone let_me know as soon as possible after i placed the order so i could amend the order ( which i then did )?
F	would never use this company again .
M	we ordered a leather_sofas which was delivered on time .
F	so , i called the customer_services line and got a young_man who was extremely unhelpful .
F	i am really looking_forward to using this to finish off this project in a 000 year_old property where shiny polyurethane varnish just looked wrong !
M	good overall service within tyreshopper , who sorted the problem with there tyre repair company .
F	theft and fraud is illegal , and you won_'_t get away with it .
M	to conclude , i would use you again .
M	some of those were recently released games as well .
M	had a text to say it would be there between 00 ; 00to 00 ; 00 in all morning waiting .
F	i am not sure if i will use the company again as although the end_result was very good , the journey was a bit of a nightmare !
M	howard
M	i contacted vd who offered to fix the lenses for a fee and it would take 0_weeks . so_far so good . that was back in june_0000 .
F	not sure if i would use again .
M	i have been trying for over 0_weeks to open a merchant account with them to accept credit_cards for my business !
M	recently ordered a bosch sander , makita_circular_saw and set of chisels again with pay0later .
F	do not sign up !!!
M	i then sent a written letter of complaint by post , but received no reply whatsoever .
F	i had to dispose of the base and packaging myself .
F	goods accurately_described and promptly delivered .
M	had problems from day 0 with this company , ordered and had faults with teh trolley had to push round the course on first try .
F	this was such a let_down as it has left no time to order or find a replacement for my daughters christmas .
F	only draw_back is the postage which is very high because they generally use a courier .
M	on this basis i made the order and my payment was debited from my account immediately .
M	however , following my latest purchase i felt disappointed and slightly angered .
F	really dodgy !!
M	this has_been the worst on - line buying experience i have ever had .
F	communication was clear
M	there had been no phone_call and the fridge_freezer was left in the middle of our storeroom complete with packaging despite our invoice stating that it would be unpacked and all packaging removed . we sent an email to curry '_s and their response was to tell us to phone customer_services and arrange for the packaging to be uplifted .
M	great website and easy to use and navigate .
F	the tickets arrived by special delivery almost three_weeks prior to the event and the seats , as promised , were in a good position .
M	the lady on the phone said i shouldn_'_t really have bought a kit if i didn_'_t know what i was doing !
M	the team are also very active on facebook and i mentioned some time ago that i would love to see them stock some of the lovepedal range , especially the kalamazoo overdrive pedal .
M	i am a happy customer .
F	i '_m sat in the window myself now and waiting for the apperence of this driver .
M	which is fine . although , 0 week_later i '_ve still not been refunded and will likely have to chase this up to make_sure it happens .
M	i needed this parcel as i '_m going on holiday tomorrow morning .
M	don_'_t use this service , id recommend look at other bots .
F	by 0pm i had given up and telephoned my son to ask him to phone you as i was not able to .
F	order the mad_hatter teen costume for my daughter , she is 00 but petite so order the large teens which is 00 - 00 year .
F	sent for these water_saving devices thinking i was doing my bit for saving the planet . starting with the 0 minute shower saver , which is just an egg timer and does not really cut it because ie , if you wash your hair in the shower it doesn_'_t give you enough time for rinsing and condition unless you stop the water in between which means you could end up scalded or worse . needs to be 0 minutes . the drop flush save is just confusing , nowhere on the website does it say can '_t be used with push_button toilets yet when received diagram only shows handle flush toilets , so i '_m confused .
M	the store manager is ineffective .
F	fast delivery , next_day delivery was dispatched whithin00mins of ordering - very impressed .
M	there should be a reduced fee for sellers who sell through ebay , especially for more_expensive goods .
M	my order was very competitively_priced , in stock and delivered on time as promised .
F	the delivery man made no attempt to knock on our door - we were in - and to make his getaway as swiftly as he possibly could the idiot put the parcel in our green dustbin which was at the front of our property .
M	i have experienced significant quality issues with the sandringham tv bed that we purchased from bensons .
M	useless waste of time
F	the information and advise from becky was exceptional , i felt so much happier after_speaking to her as i was unsure on several points she was very understanding and helpful
M	this was subsequently refunded to my account in january_0000 with no acknowledgement of the financial difficulties this had caused me .
F	tried five times to get through to the store . 0000 number to add , still nothing .
M	their website looked good and was very easy to use , so placed an order with them and paid on line - simple !
F	i received a picture from the recipient on the 0nd day after flowers were delivered .
M	the girl on the helplne was very helpful and got my tyre_fitting a day earlier
F	delivery drivers are helpful and friendly .
F	wowwww really glad i found this site , from first_class prices , to first_class delivery , could not fault in anyway , if you have never bought from here before , what are you waiting on
M	goods arrived from uk tools in good condition but 0 days_later than the one hour time_slot stated by interlink_express . as i had to cancel urgent appointments to be there at the stated time i was not at all impressed especially as they didnt even have the courtesy to tell me . this inevitably reflects_badly on uk_tool_centre as the ultimate supplier .
M	however they were good and sorted this out , arrived next_day .
M	always arrives very quickly .
M	if you knew the full_tank of gas had to be purchased then why not put it on your webiste ?
M	i really wish i had read these reviews - as the ones that say " poor customer service " etc are very true .
M	people failed to call when promised - both the delivery team and the after care service .
M	i had to wait_until 0pm one day to have this collected for a refund .
M	sent off phone on a saturday , received confirmation it had been received on monday and received my argos_voucher on tuesday - fantastic .
F	would definately use this company again
F	over priced and utterly awful customer service .
M	i only ever buy one or two machines at a time but david my account_manager is always ready to find the exact machine that i want .
F	absolutely awful , so i used once and at £_00 i was very unhappy .
M	cost for primed including_vat and carriage £_000 .
M	i got the impression you could choose your date .
M	my order sat in the status " waiting for dispatch " for some time .
F	they have totally let our family down .
M	first time used and happy so as to have recomendid it to others
F	brilliant discount at the till too !
M	got a full_refund :) i paid with paypal so when prestigeflowers customer service wasn_'_t giving me any joy i raised a complain case with paypal and explained what had happened , then prestigeflowers gave their explanation and paypal decided in my favour and i got a full_refund !
M	and if not for the kindness of the neighbour dropping them off i am not sure if i would have received the flowers that day .
F	i was really pleased with that .
F	i eventually changed the order to something that was in stock as i had already waited 0_weeks for something that their website said was in stock .
F	eventually , they agreed that i would get my vehicle at the original price and hertz would make up the shortfall .
F	i would recommend using viovet , the ordering process is very easy and delivery is super quick too !
F	mother '_s day gift for an 00 year_old .
M	but as the title_says some transactions can be iffy .
M	since the beginning of december i '_ve spent £_000 . 00 through_quidco and i '_m getting £_000 . 00 in cashback .
M	jlp do it .
F	my most_recent order has now required 0 queries to be submitted online in order to chase - there is no way of contacting them by phone .
M	' dear im
F	very happy : 0 )
F	i bought a galaxy gear watch from expansys which had a fault with the strap .
F	do not use interparcel .
F	however i have now been told that the photos are still in store and i will be refunded and a discount_code has_been offered to cover postage_costs .
M	apparently the brakes are not included in the warranty , even for a malfunction .
M	my product , an under unit strip_light , was exactly as_described and good value but , despite_opting for 0st_class delivery at extra_cost , the item took over a week to arrive .
M	you think that by paying a deposit there is more of a guarantee that the courier will show up and that if they don_'_t then you should be able to get your money back .
F	i found the website by_chance and it is fantastic . ' toys ' are great and service is brilliant .
M	i was convinced that something on the site had told me that the item was in stock but that may have been another site that i was looking at .
F	because of my results , my sister and my friend also started the diet and are having similar results .
F	at every_step of the order i received either a text or email and this left me in no_doubt that the order was being fulfilled .
F	i guess this is why they were in the sale .
M	he went to greta length explaining their process and stated it wasn_'_t possible i received such an email !
F	anything over_£_00 is free delivery & you get an awful_lot for that price .
M	our son was very much looking_forward to receiving his new superdry jacket for christmas .
M	not too good ., but at_least they sorted it out
M	radiator was £_00 cheaper , delivered , than it was available for pick_up locally .
M	it did not come on tuesday as ive stated ??
M	would use again , zero_hassle , easy transaction , paypal accepted and quick delivery .
M	sunglasses themselves had a very minute fault which i noticed when i put them on for the second time , but as they didn_'_t responded to my first email i didn_'_t bother contacting them about this issue .
M	would not recommend purchasing anything that could go bad and stick to safe products that can '_t go bad .
M	would completely recommend them to anyone and i don_'_t normally_bother_writing_reviews but their service prompted me to .
F	my lenses didn_'_t arrive so i had to go i holiday with my glasses which i hate doing .
F	they didn_'_t have the strap on their site but had an option to put in my make and model of watch and they would source the strap for me .
F	i '_ve not yet booked my return_journey .)

F	what can i say . will definitely recommend to friends and use again myself .
M	first time i have ordered oil so i was a bit lost as to where to start .
M	the blinds look great and were less_than half the price of other competitors .
M	).
F	i found the tablets more effective with your first instructions last time , now i am waiting to see the effect with your new instructuions .
F	there is not enough detail about what you are actually getting and the specification of each item is minimal .
F	i cannot wait_until my contract is up with vodafone as i will never ever use them again .
M	on arrival at the collection office at the new time , we found the office was not aware of the online changes .
M	recently_purchased a guitar_amp from these_guys .
F	after the success of my first order , was happy to use you again .
F	it started with some of their tesco_finest meals , not quite what was expected from their premier range - eg aberdeen_angus steak pasta - in fact a small_amount of mince in a pasta bake .
F	the only_thing that i didnt like was recently i ordered a sporan for my father as he had just got a new kilt and he was invited to a big dance .
M	better to pay more and get the item you want than spend hours trying to find out what on earth has happened to your order .
M	update_: received an email next_day - my order cancelled by watch shop with no explanation !
F	i could make an order easily enough , although we didn_'_t have time to make the lanyards branded , but i fully accept it was a timing issue on my behalf .
M	i have complained twice and each time nothing in reply , says it all really
M	i waited in all day .
M	dual desks on either side would be sensible .
F	i chose the free delivery option and was impressed with the speed of delivery especially_considering all of this snow .
M	from st pauli where our hotel was , we were one corner from altona train_station and you can get tickets for the s - bahn “ fast train ” for very cheap .
F	how about offering another one of your customers enjoying a holiday in london alternative_accommodation in birmingham and see how they respond .
F	i had chosen nominated day delivery which_meant that i was in all day on the day that i had chosen .
F	interlink_express told me i would receive my package between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 i waited at home the whole day and nothing arrived .
M	ffx 0_stars
F	my ticket clearly_stated sleeper but had a seat assignment .
M	however they soon lost interest and started to give me the run around .
F	that is until i bought furniture from oakfurnitureland . co . uk and received below_par furniture , i posted a review which was removed , i received an_email from trustpilot asking me to verify i actually had dealings with the company as the company could not verify i was a customer from the information on the trustpilot website .
F	i went to london on saturday_morning and it was delivered that afternoon .
F	the occasion has now passed so even if the flowers reach her now it would be pointless .
M	on contacting cs about this i was required to fax through proof of posting !
F	when the invitations arrived , the quality of them and the white envelopes provided with them was much_better_than i expected and they feel and look expensive .
F	tried to place an order which was cancelled then tried again thinking it was just a glitch and again order cancelled .
M	ok , it was easter , and a last_minute order , so maybe this is partly my fault .
F	exactly_what i wanted
F	so again , i have to correct these people - stop pointing the finger , get your facts straight , and find my stuff .
M	i received my breaker 00 days after i ordered it .
M	not ideal , but said ok . got a call yesterday to say item had not arrived in warehouse , so delivery early july !
F	this may have been down to me calling it the clamp ( i '_m not aufait with drumming speak !).

F	no apology from city_link so i have made formal complaints to both precious_little_ones and city_link - would not use plo again only due to awful ' collect yourself late at night ' service !
F	i ordered the brother max high_chair which arrived with a faulty table .
F	often find what i want that i am unable to find elsewhere .
M	the service at my tuxedo was great - my shirt was dispatched promptly and i was given plenty of commuication .
F	also makes it almost_impossible to move for mowing the grass .
M	want to be spoken to in a rude and abrupt manner from so called " customer_services "?
M	excellent service all_round .
M	so a big saving right ?
F	the service in the shop was pleasant and efficient .
F	passed to courier for delivery .
M	park offer an excellent service but are let bown by the courier service they use .
F	i found a card in the letterbox with a number to call which was not in use , i then via the internet found a mobile number rang it left a message and no response .
M	the reply was no .
F	the other thing is that the site is simple to use and you don_'_t get bombarded with adds and heaps of other off putting info when you ' re trying to stay focused on just getting what you typed in to get !
M	they hide_behind the fact that they sell online so their photoshopped images hide the shoddy condition of the junk they peddle , and when you try and return it , get ready for the circus .
F	excellent communication .
F	service and delivery is excellent .
F	i would recommend this company absolutley and i look_forward to working with them again as their service is fabulous !
F	a fantastic easy way to get cash_back on the things you buy .
F	barbs

F	breakfast was awful in the fact a bus arrived full of chinese people , who hoarded the buffet .
M	suggest emails from customer are acknowledged .
M	i would never recommend buying from this company - and i wish i had '_ve read more reviews before i did !
M	even some of my real - life friends tell me that it helps them to ' keep in touch '.
F	i have used medicanimal for a long time , ordering food and sundries for my two dogs on a regular_basis .
M	scuff_marks and a red mark on side - where did that come from .
M	search_function on the website returned exactly_what i was looking for making the site easy to use .
F	and if anyone at very reads this then they are more than welcome to contact me by phone . but i doubt that it will be endless emails and letters rather_than at talk to me .
F	when xmas_period time passed , i was mildy surprised , as i received another automatic email prompting me to provide feedback about their quality of service .
M	approximately 0 . 0 years_ago , i place an order for about £_000 worth of goods that never arrived .
F	instead he said he would arrange for someone to collect it the next_day and leave me without a bed for a minimum of four_weeks ( the length of time is would take to receive another bed ).
F	the prices are competitive and the delivery fast and reliable .
M	as for the flight - the plane was fairly old with a ' entertainment ' that was awful for a 00 hour flight , and uncomfortable seats .
M	following your helpful comments :
F	batteries ordered and delivered 0_days_later - excellent !
F	we kept receiving invoices , direct_debit instructions and then finally started receiving notice that they were stopping our service which we had not used for months .
F	i was expecting the shelves to be a lower quality because of the price ,
F	if there were an issue with my address , which as it stands there was not , my address matches exactly the address you had .
F	i would definitely use them again .
F	all that said the goods came early and were fine , i do wonder what would have happened had there been an_error ?
M	absolutely nothing has_been done about any of this after 0 emails and 0 phone_calls .
M	i am now going to contact gd to follow - up on this issue .
F	currently trying to resolve matter with post_office resolutions , not a good service nor an expected outcome .
M	: d
M	my 00 yr_old dog has a grade 0 heart murmour and is now heavily reliant on medication to keep him comfortable .
F	was kept_updated on my order througout the process , ordered on the friday and received on the monday .
F	i have brought so many items and every time i recieve them they are wonderful and really up to all the expectations - i have given the items as presents and used them in work shops they are really wonderful - thank_you - i have never been dissapointed .
F	i did get a 00_% reduction but this cannot compare to getting them half price in effect .
M	my wife and i have reduced mobility due to sciatic nerve damage for one , and osteo - arthritis in the knee joints for the other .
M	a great price and unbelievable service .
F	i was severely disappointed , as i '_ve_used eflorist before and had no_problems what so ever .
M	!.
M	from_start to finish i couldn_'_t believe_how easy it was .
F	perfumes reminded us of . i thought of the one i wore when i met my future husband .
F	since i spoke to them my mum rang me to say on 00th_january_0000 , which was nearly 0_weeks_later she received a delivery of dead , slimy flowers and the delivery person did not request a signature !
F	do not order from wally '_s gifts if you expect to get the item you paid for .
M	so i rang them up and then 0lady said someone will come and collect but the it lady wasn_'_t in and then i rang the next_day and now i haven_'_t to pay for posted and packing .
F	i have had 0 years worth including this consignment but i am still unsure if bimuno has helped .
F	it would be delivered and she estimated . drum roll
F	00 out of 00 !
M	i '_m a taxi_driver and it can get quite cold out there when its quiet and your sat on the rank .
M	delivery was on time and the ring was as good as expected .
M	recovered a small error in the processing of my order very quickly and made sure the right products came to me post_haste .
M	would recommend again @ i '_ll be back to unlock my blackberry !
F	not impressed with what was sent and i felt rather embarrassed at what had actually beeen sent from me to my mother .
M	bottom_line was that i got a good car at an excellent price .
M	very polite and helpful from_start to finish .
M	the gig_bag i ordered was out of stock , with a likely wait of several weeks , but the hobgoblin people tracked one down in one of their shops and got it to me within a couple of days !
M	this is a great site for getting hard to get fragrances
F	they also wanted to see the spare_tyre - but mine does not have a spare_tyre just a refill can !
M	bozowi did not like this and so they have threatened to sue me and have kept my phone and refused to respond to my emails .
F	far too much effort was put in and the delivery timelines when ordering are not clear .
M	good quality .
M	i ordered a silver tankard for a friends 00th_birthday , which i had engraved .
F	they keep you up to date the whole time .
M	beyond ridiculous and should be illegal especially when dealing_with peoples money .
M	this was one of the very best ways of collecting airmiles until recently .
M	in my opinion , china_chaps are a very bad company and are not to be trusted .
M	happy to recommend
F	fast postage value for money very handy if limited in movement
F	hors fia - net ne m ' a jamais contacté .
M	two hours_later , i called them again .
M	what more could you ask for ?
F	i bought two jackets for my family this month they are so pleased with them
M	there comes a time when even if you wish to stay with a company their appalling behaviour and lack of courtesy is too much .
M	they did in the end refund my delivery charge as a gesture of goodwill .
M	they are not interested in the custom whatsoever .
M	they said they may have to refund me .
F	after i had accepted the quote and paid the processing fee , communication did go quiet but i was told i '_d have my car within 0 - 0_weeks which was super as mentioned_above , i really needed a car quickly !
M	clearly this is more than just the " glitch " that the company mentioned in response to previous reviews .
M	this gives customers the opportunity to cancel if they wish , or notify the supplier of a change of address or bank_account etc .
M	in the end rather_than wait for eternity for a response i took the curtains to a seamstress to have them altered , didn_'_t make them so cheap after all by the time i paid for the extra work .
F	i see the above star system seems to be mainly estimated on " friction ."
M	i contrast , a call to british_gas at the same time got my query resolved within 0 mins .
M	i asked for photo_evidence of the damage and was told they cannot do that . l .
F	well because it was my partners 00th_birthday it had to be something different , unusual and special did i get it right ? oh_yes he_loves_his lord title , the best present ever , i curtsied every time i saw him he think `_s it `_s hilarious
F	well_packed due to fragile intents , quick and easy !
M	it should be closer to 0 hrs at most .
F	i had sent mails and left voicemails to no_avail , so the customer service note was welcome .
M	it '_s all in the detail !
M	they ' re closed on saturdays .
F	excellent advice and service from tim on the phone .
M	bought a wooden kitchen trolley in march_0000 ebay id - 000000000000 from these_people trading on ebay under the seller name discounthomestore ( since stopped trading on ebay and the web under this name ).
F	glasses arrived within a week ( i have a perscription that isn_'_t too unusual ) and were great value for money and look awesome .
F	too many excuses , too many people who cant do the job they are paid for and the customer loses out .
F	a phone_call made and staff were so unhelpful but have me a managers email , i emailed saying i wanted a refund , had no reply !!
F	i '_m now compiling my fifth annual photo_album .
F	i also contacted my local constabulary and made an official_complaint about this company .

F	highly_recommend .
M	the very next_morning i had an email to tell me the money had already been transferred to my bank_account ( which it had ).
F	box and content damaged large hole in side
F	i would not have been disappointed if my package came a bit late in this busy christmas_period , but i '_m surprised that it managed to arrive today !
F	if they were an honest company on the final page on their website it would remind one that custom duties will have to be met .
M	handlebars incorrect , tyres incorrect , alternative rims / wheels supplied look terrible compared to the original dt swiss .
F	after another week and still no headphones i sent another email to which they didn_'_t reply to for a few_days .
M	but got no response .
M	ideal if your a chav . tacky stuff
F	i check my emails and i see that i have an_email_confirming that £_00 has_been put onto my debit_card .
M	they were very helpful and guided_me in the right_direction , and they new what they were talking_about .
F	i got a gentleman_who put me on hold and said he '_d go and check .
M	after giving a basic valuation they then take £_00 off that as an administrator fee as a starting_point .
F	he was picky and we found it generally difficult to get something suitable in his size but this website made it easy to choose !
F	booking_reference_0000000
M	now i just need to wrestle them onto my mantas .
F	the villa looks on the pics as if it might be overlooked , but it isn_'_t really .
M	the question is , why would a florist feel its ok to chuck some flowers in a box , then have them out for delivery for over 0 hours in the back of a van !
F	really gutted .
M	we are so very pleased with our new items and everyone who has seen them have commented on how lovely they are .
M	i bought annual_worldwide_cover on the recommendation of a friend to cover trips to new_zealand , australia , greece and usa .
M	rang customer service who said they can '_t help or reinstate offer .
M	just placed my very first order with raja - pack and found the whole_process very good .
M	tried to send you message but your site was down .
F	see the above comment as that says it all
M	they telephoned on 00 / 00 to say the tyres had arrived and could be fitted there and then .
F	gran melia palacio de isora in tenerife is a beautiful hotel with an amazing salt water pool .
F	the due date for delivery came and not knowing whether i was still going to have the delivery i rang - no answer and emailed asking if they could advise .
M	ordering from chemist_direct is so easy and big_savings as well
M	could only get 00 ish meg speed even_though paid for fibre , thay lie promise u anything to sign longer , tell u u can leave dont owe anything then threaten you with court for the cost of tv box even thogh it says free , letters from bailiffs even when you have sent box back , got the reciept , and tell them still get letters , so much stress caused made me very ill , no one needs it . stay well clear
M	order my ladders at half price of anywhere_else at 0pm , arrived very next_morning 00 . 00am .
F	i would recommend this company to anyone .
F	after many emails and telephone_conversations at my expense , it is now friday and it is now being collected but that is not the end of it .
F	i am very disappointed with the service you have provided throughout this entire shipping process .
M	good price , easy to order , local workshop helpful and efficient .
M	jim at the milton rd branch in edinburgh was very helpful , both on the phone and when i took the car in to get the tyres replaced .
F	we sat in our cabin and took our own entertainment as we was unsure if we could use the lounge and did not know when the entertainment started and what it was .
F	didn_'_t have any_problems such as having to send back for a refund or exchange , so don_'_t know whether this would have gone to plan or not .
M	how can this be , surely i shouldnt be able to order them in the first place .
F	i have never used this service before so was unsure what to expect .
F	it was the first time that i used the company .
F	the whole ordering process was straightforward , but i particularly_like the way that prices are shown inclusive of vat and delivery , so there are no nasty_surprises at the checkout stage .
F	it didn_'_t take long to choose exactly_what we wanted .
F	fantastic :-/ i would advise to never join talktalk !!!!!!!
M	i have had the gate arms 00 months and have a major problem , in that the arm casing has broken ( 0yr warrantry ).
F	they are ridiculous charge for voicemail service i dont have , they charge £ 0 . 00 one off fees which is erm every_month and no one can explain_why ?
F	they have a lot better customer_care .
F	i waited in all day today for an engineer to visit as stated by the " written off team " and no one visited .
F	perfect !
F	very happy :)
M	i placed an order only to discover that i ' d bought the wrong item .
F	to charge £ 0 for slow delivery and £ 0 insurance is the highest of any company i have ordered with .

M	whilst holidayautos booking process works really well it is important to fully understand the contract with the car_hire company .

F	changed my packaging as well
M	def will be using my protein for my next order !
M	customer_services is a joke , told me to drive to oldbury ( 00 ) round_trip to collect the parcel instead of waiting .
F	i always use longacres as i know i can be assured of a quality bouquet that the recipient will love .
F	why dont they charge you for that before hand , sounds_like cheating , stealing . mis just wrong .
M	my car was returned with a large stain ( still wet ) on the passenger_seat .
M	but when £_00 was knocked_off for light cosmetic_damage and a bend in the right corner of the phone , i got a bit annoyed .
F	no reply to emails asking for a refund .
M	everything was positive initially .
F	i would highly_recommend them to anyone .
M	i would recommend lenstore as they provided good value and delivered on time with no_problems .
M	the website was bright , clear and easy to navigate , but the item was delivered a day later than the one given to me in an email and customer service wasn_'_t that easy to get through to .
F	the next_day helen long called and we must have been in the phone for about half an_hour ( my fiancé and i only want to go to one specific island in the maldives ) which is why we were finding it so hard .
F	phoned up and i was told to ignore the text and that they only needed a few details
F	ordered from this website 00th_april was e_- mailed package had been despatched on 00th_april , expected within 0 - 0_days money has_been taken out of my account , e_- mailed them for more information had no reply only e_- mail from them was to leave a review .

F	i had specified , should the recipient not be in , for it to be delivered to any neighbour which was not done and no one rang me to tell me that presumably none of the neighbours were in .

M	usb0u worked with us to ensure that the print colour we required was correct .
M	quick delivery , arrived on time , friendly delivery men .

F	we chauffeured marialee '_s flowers to address removed today , but luck just wasn_'_t on our side : failed delivery
F	do not use this company
M	no stars , can '_t go into negatives but i would if i could .
F	looked a little tired and tacky and wasn_'_t that cheap !
F	delivery was quick enough too .
M	yep l reckon that the product looks good and will carry on working for years to come , there may some noise but its not all the time as l it is the fan inside the freezer .
M	the day after i posted the phone i got 0 emails the first stated the phone had been received and was being_processed and he second told me that everything was ok and approved .
F	first horse we ordered was delivered to the wrong_address and we been called liars as we apparently have received it and just saying we did not get it . after we have managed to prove it wasn_'_t us who signed for it they promised to send us a new toy , which again didn_'_t arrive on time .
M	i don_’_t know much about pc ’_s so i used their remote page to identify my memory type and bought same in good faith .

F	prompt service , thank_you
M	although this of good quality material and was marked up a a medium_size , beware it '_s massive !
M	+ customer service seemed to be very good .
M	so . my order gets shipped , and some arrives , not everything is there though , infact a graphics_card i payed 000 £ for which has_been taken from my account , isnt in the delivery , even_though its in the delivery note , i email them and im re - embursed , i take a look at there site and see the graphics_card . whilst iv been waiting for the ssd to come in has_gone off offer , so even_though i payed for the item while it was on offer it was taken from my delivery , and then it was me who had to chase them for re - embursment
M	we ordered a comfort pocket 0000 memory mattress and are delighted with our choice .
M	presentation was not as good as previous_orders .

M	the rxsport provided me with awesome support and they have answered every each question , even silly one sometimes .
F	packaged well and exactly_what i had expected .
F	the courier had left it in my safe space and popped a card through the door , this was followed up with an e_- mail .
M	i were calling bt trying to get help on their facebook profile but is already 00 days from my disconnection time and things aren_'_t moving inch forward .
F	turns_out i had to pay them the cheque amount back as they had made a mistake .
F	easy website to use .
M	awaiting reply from office .
F	it is cheaper ; but for me , i don_'_t want to compromise on flavour so it '_s back to the original branded capsules .
M	i was very impressed with the knowledge and helpfulness of the staff .
M	we were then given details of this treatment by a friend and i can_honestly_say , it is miracle fluid .
M	the website was easy to navigate , secure payment options and the price was best i could_find .
F	well 00 . 00 came and went .
M	at a more trivial level , the photobook assistant offers " helpful videos ".
M	order arrived well_packed and in good condition .
M	good and fast delivery well_packaged
M	i was called back as soon as i ' d finished on chat to take details for my order .
F	i was happy with the easy postal process and received the cheque quickly .
M	after getting no help from selectspecs i took them to a high_street_opticians and got them to test them for me and even write up a little report that shows of the 0 measurements needed to made a pair of glasses , 0 of theses measurement were different to what i ordered .
F	i ordered online & as there wasn_'_t the selection i wanted in stock i emailed them and they managed to sort it out for me straight_away & kept me updated .
M	a really first_class job which i would recommend without_any reservation .
M	genuine sunglasses from a reputable_company .
F	i had to have the procudure with the longer recovery i can not remember the name now .
M	i was informed of a delivery window at 0 . 00 the following_morning and it was in my hands 00_minutes later .
M	however if you need an online consultation and a private_prescription from their own doctor (£_00 ), the postage costa are a minimum of £ 0 . 00 even if your medicine bill is over £_00 .
M	i paid for next_day delivery which didn_'_t happen .
F	i was kept up to date with the progress of my order and informed when it was delivered including the time , i spoke to the person i sent them too and she said they were lovely .
M	quick delivery and helpful support staff .
M	very good and great price
M	i cant .
F	i now have to contact my credit_card company to get them to deal with this company .
M	i ordered 0 packs of shelves , both of which were in very poor condition , all bashed and scratched when received .
M	i had a looka round numerous sites for a long time thinking which one is a honest and true trustworthy website to buy from .
F	i would order from this company again .
F	i ordered flowers for mothers_day .
F	have recommended this site to many many people now and they say how fantastic it is too
M	the only other annoying_thing is the way they con you with the fuel .
M	i have requested a refund on the next_day delivery fee , and am still_waiting on the 0rd chair / stool .
M	i suspect the items were out of stock but they won_'_t admit a flaw in their ' live ' online stock system .
F	the only problem was the way they were packed in the box , they are counted in 00 '_s ( one bundle only had 00 ) and put top to tail which makes them flat , but when you get to the last two bundles they were squashed in the top of the box and are a bit bent around the sides .
F	this is now a year later , they are still not refunding me the whole amount .
M	was disappointed when the goods arrived as for two small storage racks i paid £_00 ( inc_vat ) for delivery and yet 0 of the uprights were just thrown in the delivery van with no protection on them , they were just taped_together at one end and in the middle with the kind of tape and labels that tears and leaves residue when you try to remove them .
M	their customer service is appalling , completely lacking in any sensitivity and their behaviour borders on the criminal .
F	ps happy with the product though
F	literally , have gone the extra_mile and had a long day , getting to this remote (_ish ) end of the country !
M	they have since all been replaced and the light fixtures are working as they should ( so_far ).
M	so it all turned_out ok in the end , but i had to be pretty tough with them to make them play ball , and i expect most people would just allow themselves to be stitched up with unfair and completely unjustified fees .
F	0_weeks_later despite_numerous_emails from me , i was still_waiting for my bean_bag .
M	i sent a second email with the same request , asking either for a return email , or for a telephone_call , to let_me know that the deliveries would be made yesterday .
M	no_problems with my purchase of a pc component , it arrived in a few_days .
M	i found it hard to find a number to contact anyone as there was no number left on the card pushed through the letterbox .
M	they hide_behind distance_selling contract which leaves customer in the dark
M	my hand was never out my pocket and it had to be deep every time as your ship aint cheap .
F	fine – we thought .
M	not any higher_than 0_stars because when it came to paying out there are a number of administrative obstacles to overcome - i ' d say they use some sort of breakage model to retain the commission longer_than is necessary .
F	both myself and son order every_month from vio_vets .
F	after_reading_reviews for viagogo on various_websites , i am now close to tears at what seems to be the inevitable prospect of losing a couple of hundred_quid .
F	very easy shopping .
M	of e_liquid .
M	as long as you don_'_t expect them to stock any of the stuff they advertise on the website they are ok for the odd deal .
M	they also rightly deleted the ad .
M	they admitted their mistake and offered either to pay for my expenses in returning my glsses or to sell a set of extra lenses to me at full price .
M	i spend over 00 min on the phone trying to sort simple issue with them , and at the end i end up with nothing what was promised .
M	your website said that everything i ordered was in stock - i needed to know this because i had a very quick_turnaround on a bathroom_project .
F	disappointed with your site and with myself for being such a girl !
M	in the meantime .
F	placed my first order after being highly_recommended by a friend .
M	the glasses are both fine .
M	the product was not packed properly so on arrival all the product had leaked in the box . it was for next_day delivery but this did not happen as it was for a birthday . on a up note your staff were very good and a full_refund accepted .
F	call_centre aren_'_t in touch with the products being offered and i had to instruct them where to look on their own website .
M	the store was well_laid_out and the staff knowledgeable .
M	cheque received in a couple of days after despatch .
F	the sub - total came to £_00 . 00 plus p_&_p , but the original offer was £_00 . 00 !!
F	a week_later i still had not received the new pair so i sent another email to which they replied_saying they haven_'_t received my address so i resent the email with my address .
F	they will always go out of their way to help ( particularly sandy ).
F	i would certainly recommend this company to anyone great offers good customer service well_packaged and they also update u with special_offers when they come in couldn_'_t fault them
M	it arrived intact eventually though .
M	i odered tyres online to match tyres already on my vehicle .
F	i had also received an_email in the meantime advising that they had received my phone and my order was being_processed .
F	special_offers and discounts make battery_force the best place to buy batteries .
F	nowhere when booking or even when i received my confirmation did it mention any where that there were extra taxes to be paid to the hotel .
F	thank_you
M	thanks !
F	we have now cancelled the order with dell and have ordered similar machines from dabs who have the items in stock in the uk and who can get them to us on a next_day delivery .
F	what more can one ask of a firm ?
F	the fabric i consequently ordered was sent out in the wrong fabric .
F	i think they assume we will give up if we get no response .
M	fast and efficient service at a price that is more than reasonable , considerably_cheaper_than any other supplier .
F	they should have stopped the offer when they reached a level they could cope with - not rocket_science just sensible trading !
M	length or width .
F	concerned , i contacted them and said i needed the bunny food as soon as possible as i had a poorly bunny in need of it .
M	still did not work so i got a refund .
M	great tasting_protein and i feel great after taking the dynamite stack , more alert and stronger with great pump .
F	0 years_ago and paid £_00 . 00 more .
M	our daughter '_s birthday was on 00 july and despite_numerous_emails and phonecalls ( more of which later ), we decided to cancel the order , which we did on 00 july_0000 and had to go to argos and buy one in store for significantly more money .
F	i didn_'_t receive the updates promised , and would have to chase each day .
F	this was no good as i would be at work and there would be no one to sign for it !
M	the delivery was rapid .
M	handyman skills required to install but no more .
F	i came_across this company by_chance and ordered from them last_year .
F	i wanted the cleaner they had promised me on both_occasions !
F	this also happened in the next lane and when we queried it with an official we were told that it happens all the time and that eventually my ferry_link would be told by the port authority that they must do something about it .
M	good easy web_site to use , sometimes delivery seems to take longer_than you might expect .
M	if i subscribed again , which is unlikely after my recent experience , i would confirm my cancellation by recorded mail so that i can not be scammed .
F	competitive price and i '_m very happy with the product .
F	by the time it had arrived , the carrier_bag was crumpled and even ripped .
F	where did you leave it ?
M	i seem to be paying a fortune and have begun switching supply to another_provider .
F	arrived promptly and well_packaged .
F	they are a scam !!!
F	thankyou bobby
F	unreal .
F	i needed to order some vietnamese dong but your company did not seem to handle this particular currency .
F	darren replied it was not just a vehicle you needed but also a driver .
M	this is the second time that an item on the order has_been ' in stock ' on the web_site but then unavailable when it comes to the order being dispatched to me .
M	the following_day we received a phone_call saying delivery would be between 0 and 0 and someone would ring 00_minutes before delivery sunday_afternoon arrived and along came a white_van which turned_out to be our delivery .
M	everything and more i expected no faults
F	fabulous service & very competative_prices .
M	imagine our dismay the next_day when we again checked the tracking and an additional line had been put in before the line about its return to the service centre saying " could not gain_access at 0 . 00am ".
F	bit disappointed this time .
M	i wasn_'_t happy .
M	besides this someone promised me from a branch of santander to call me and i have received no calls .
F	it '_s hard to find quality websites .
M	!
F	never ever go with this company !
F	already_recommended to friends .
M	i argued that i had actually been waiting since thursday for my tyre not 0 : 00 that morning , ( this was only 0 : 00 ) and that an exception to their , " first come first served " rule might have some latitude as this was my second trip to the garage to have it fitted through no fault of my own , oh in fact it their fault they are wasting my time and money travelling to them !
F	they were silver and blue as the school colours .
M	the second order was delayed 0 days before despatch as their system flagged 0 out of stock items , then they advise they weren_'_t out of stock , but yet still delayed .
F	they are better_than many providers ( i . e 0 ) but probably not the best out there , i think i stay with them out of habit , more than because i get a brilliant deal with my contract .
F	i was going to be unable to get to a q due to work_commitments and had resigned_myself to waiting until the phone was back in stock again , but , at 000 the day before launch , i get a call from their call_centre offering me a chance to upgrade to the iphone 0 and it would be delivered on launch !
M	i was very impressed with the speed and quality of service , so much in fact that i have recommended fonebank to my son to use .
F	from booking this holiday we '_ve been disappointed !
F	the service was first_class and vary quick delivery .
F	but what was disappointing was that the rug was quite a bit darker_than appeared in the photo .
M	if one side has a voice and doesn_'_t have to pay , why should the other be disadvantged ?
F	here we go with numerous_emails again !
M	turned_up a day before the expected delivery date .
F	no_problems
M	sent 0 e_- mails no reply
F	having said that the blind is lovely
F	was promised a call back within 00min and did not receive a call for 0_days .
F	i first ordered a medium top , and it turned_out to be a size 0 !!
F	guess_what ?
M	excellent sevice and product
M	they used dpd_couriers as well so i was given a 0 hour delivery slot which is very handy . no waiting around - it came well within the 0 hour_slot .
M	i purchased a slection pack of ear_plugs at snorestore . co . uk for £_00 so i could_find out which type i was suited to .
F	great delivery service .
F	i like what i bought .
M	very impressed with you but not impressed with the courier you have
M	now 0 days have elapsed since ordering , and it '_s saturday so it will be monday at the earliest and 00 days , before arrival .
F	not quite sure if i '_d order from website again - maybe if elsewhere was sold out again !
F	i ordered a plaid scarf , at her request , for my 00 - year_old granddaughter .
M	i glued some padding to each area and wear the boots comfortably now , i preferred not to return them because other than that the boots are great .
M	great member of staff and an asset to your company !
F	when i contacted them i had no response for 00 hour and then a reply_stating to buy the correct product again and they will try ( try !)
M	good website and easy to work through to find correct_part for ram_upgrade to toshiba_laptop .
M	if it does the job it '_s supposed too i may consider it , but in all honesty , if they continue using dpd as their couriers . i may stick to bodybuildingwarehouse . yes it '_s more_expensive , but it '_s never late , always next_day delivery .
F	work_tops delivered on time by friendly helpful 0 man team .
M	good :
F	i was pleased with the quality of the wedding_invitations i ordered and delighted that i also got some complimentary thank_you cards .
M	this is not very clear on website .
F	product was very good , but customer service was not .
M	all wrapped very neatly and very well folded .
F	they didn_'_t pressure me into buying anything ( i did that all on my own ).
F	fast , reliable service .
F	sheila bull
M	you guys_rock !
M	i wrote to the supplier , but heard_nothing for a few weeks , so decided to phone him .
M	i did an mot in chichester garage last_year .
F	w00 0ar
M	a week_later again , still nothing , so i asked them to just give me a refund .
M	delivery , second to none , but prints very pale , even after several nozzle cleans and head cleans etc .
F	i found the customer service quite poor as the woman seemed vey unsure and gave_me false_information about when i would receive the tickets .
F	we found pharmacy0u provided an excellent service , responsive , helpful and prompt .
F	the service swell_pets deliver is excellent .
M	given that they send out wheels all the time , you would think there would be a better compensation mechanism in place to cover damage .
F	would not_hesitate to recommend .
F	flowers were received by recipient on the same day and she said they are beautiful
M	i would steer right clear of them , they should not be allowed to trade .
F	so all the bases had been covered by clothes0order .
M	i am very pleased with it and with the service provided .
F	i have spent_hundreds on my phone contract .
F	usually stay in long_term parking , but preferred the more efficient and shorter distance to the airport and return ,
M	completely satisfactory , absolutely wonderful .
M	a word of warning , should a pimper find a crack in our blinds we ' re both coming up to 00 years old and the veiw could put them off sex for life
M	they lie through there teeth .
F	you can upload 0 free pics as well for your ad .
M	poor communication between different staff and customer .
F	another week_later the same thing .
M	my advice dont be silly . save your money and look about , theres cheap couriers everywhere including ebay .
M	broadly speaking , the whole stag_do was a success with one exception .
F	there wasn_'_t much of a wait , but i did have to phone 0 times to get to the bottom of things .
F	you have been warned !
F	i spent over 0 hours trying to change the delivery address but couldn_'_t log_onto the site and just kept getting emails from serenata with a link that i couldn_'_t use as it was greyed out and didn_'_t exist when i tried to key it in manually .
M	i am aware that this happened some time ago , but having read some of the other reviews , it appears that this company is still at it '_s old tricks .
M	just to confirm my credit_card company chased the refund on my behalf .
M	perfect transaction , super_fast delivery as promised , quality item , can '_t wait to shop_here again
F	so far from very , on three different occasions
M	another week passes by and nothing . so i call to investigate and was advised that actually the blinds have not been ordered .
M	!
M	very unhappy .
F	so i rang and asked for confirmation of my order in writing they stumbled and mumbled around " their systems " before telling_me that unfortunately they had sent my confirmation_email to the wrong_address . after telling them how unprofessional this was especially if any of my payment details were in the email they eventually agreed to resend the email , unfortunately the lady in customer_services slammed the phone down before i had a chance to thank her .
M	thanks golfbase
F	excellent service and quick delivery .
M	a couple of issues : the l - sectioned uprights were not all at right angles and needed some tricky hand - bending to put them right , and there was confusion about whether the packs did or didn_'_t include bay connectors ( they didn_'_t , and extra deliveries ensued ).
M	0 month later i got the response " we have completed the order for the full value and you should receive an email in the next 00_hours to confirm that the cheque is due for dispatch ."
M	the frying_pan is very heavy and so well_constructed , the knife_block very heavy ( although some wood shavings were blocking some of the slits , which needed to be cleaned out - poor inspection methinks ).
F	so basically paid money for a service that was meant to take
F	i fully recommend tecc cigarets as they stopped me from smoking the first time i vapped & i was on between 00 & 00 per day
M	the staff were courteous and reassured me of their assistance in the event of there being any_problems with the piano .
F	the pupils are usually nearer to the tutor and therefore making transport easier .
F	we bought a small statue and 0 medals for a school_disco .
F	serenata quickly offered me a full_refund , but i still didn_'_t know where the flowers and chocolates were because the tracking_system didn_'_t recognise the order number or mum '_s postcode .
M	facebook says keys will come out at_0000hrs on 0th_nov - not true
F	i ordered a watch for my fiance as a wedding present to give him on our_wedding day .
F	we might travel again but may have to just stay in the basic cabin and drink my own cans of juice .
M	your emails also quite clearly_state that you were closed from the 00st until the 00th .
F	everything was perfect - couldn_'_t ask for more .
M	got a text the day after the flowers were supposed to have been delivered " flowers have been left securely at the front of the property ".
M	pleasure to use
M	i like itunes but it has got very expensive .
F	we booked the harry_potter tour in london , our plane got in a little late so we called the tour office told them this and that we were taking a taxi there .
M	the customer service was second to none , i was kept_informed of the delivery times , infact it arrived sooner_than_expected .
M	at which point it was then said that in future i needed to check my order statuses changed from received to processed , as though it was my responsibility to check your back office were doing their job correctly .
F	i hired a lens for three_days and had no_problems with it .
F	slotted the memory into my macbook and immediately up and running . no problem .
F	a man was sent to fix in within half hour of reporting it .
M	:) and its so easy to order all hassle_free :)
F	the most i tried was 00 times in one working day between office hours ( please disregard that statement if you want to but i have no motive to mislead and just a genuine intention of not letting others lose their hard earn '_t ) i contacted wowcher - they responded by forwarding an_email - still unable to get through to redeem my voucher i contacted customer_services again and was informed that i could only claim back 00_% of the amount i paid and that would be in wowcher credit ( if i understood correctly this credit also has a time limit ) i have been unable to redeem 0 vouchers before but it has not ended quite so expensively . i would also like to state that out of the vouchers purchased before we had a caravan break planned that was cancelled days before we were due to go away and a meal in london with friends that the restaurant cancelled a couple of hours before the reservation time !
F	we are getting_married and we are in need of good decorations .
M	it was delivered quickly and i am very pleased with it .
M	they didnt seem to care , but i was told there had been a system error and that my parcel would be here monday0th / tuesday0th .
F	i had to pick it up as i wasn_'_t in when they delivered - hardest_thing ever !
F	the after service is an_absolute_disgrace !!!
M	i was waiting on an important perscription which took several days , it was never relayed to me that they had to order the medication in .
F	the service was fine & delivered in good time however . the flowers were sparse didn_'_t even fill a vase .
M	as per the same regulations that you are quoting , i have 00 days to issue you with the refund so i '_ll take care of that for you .
M	as i know so little about your company i feel that i should only give an average rating - i . e three stars .
M	it was showing as in stock on their website .
F	they were thick material although summer looking dresses .
M	on the whole we thought the service provided was for their benefit rather_than the customer .
F	the package has_been delivered in less_than 00_hours , normally brilliant , but how can i now be sure that the person concerned is actually going to get the parcel . a very big parcel at that . pleased with the superfast service at any other time but this 0 day delivery was booked for a reason .
F	i have recommended highly to my friends , it just astonishes me that people don_'_t always take up the option of shopping via_topcashback !!
M	the next time i am just going to bag them up and recycle them as paper as its easier and you get the money in your hand right away .
M	i found the service very good , the guy knew a bit about the tyres and the fitting arrangements with car care in tetbury went very smoothly .
M	i will not use them again and strongly_recommend others to go_elsewhere .
M	nevertheless , still amazing food
M	i honestly think bodybuilding_warehouse is a really decent company .
F	good service , but more accurate information needed !
M	about 00 . 00am i went to bed , i woke around 0pm to find no parcel or attempted delivery card .
F	at the end of the day they ferry you and your vehicle across the water and charge you the going rate .
M	i was emailed with a one hour delivery slot , which the item arrived within .
M	will_def be back again .
M	the product that i buy has_gone up in price buy 0 pounds . i don_'_t know the reason for this . but this is no good for customer service . so i don_'_t rate at all
F	paid £_000 for delivery and they can not even deliver it when they promised .
M	the first time i put it on the caravan and tightend the straps i ripped a strap away from its fastening .
F	dpj000 .
F	this site is fantastic .
M	i '_ve had a great experience in dealing_with gizzmoheaven .
F	its a lot of work for what turns_out to be only a small refund , but if you have nothing better to do with your time , give it a go !
M	i am pleased with the products i have bought .
F	my machine was delivered within a couple of days :-) super service
F	the husband loved his bday present great service and great prices thanks
F	disappointing having to wait so long for it , as i wouldn_'_t have ordered it if i '_d known it was out of stock
F	nothing special about the website as a whole .
M	it was taped solidly to the counter so one could not gauge its weight .
F	my sisters were pleased isth them and that is what mattered in the end !
M	so_far so good and the service was fast and efficient .
M	thanks laura .
F	was very helpful when i asked a question and reliable when i ordered the items i asked for .
M	their guys are polite and well_mannered .
F	the only_negative i have is the delivery company used , but that '_s no fault of healthysupplies and their customer service was fantastic in sorting it out .

M	purchased memory_stick from gizzmo_heaven great product at a bargain price delivered in super_fast time say no more great company to deal with .
F	in less_than a week i had my new glasses delivered and they were just as good , if not better_than in their pictures .
F	my sister '_s phone is t - mobile and it is amazing !
M	not good value for money .
M	i will be filing a chargeback for this faulty tshirt and will not be giving any more of my money to a company who has such a bad customer service response , and poor aftercare service
M	it also cost me a fortune in phone_calls to their customer service / tracking line as there was no online tracking .
M	a complete_disaster from_start to finish , first ordered two bean_bags through groupon , had to wait months to finally receive them , was given a £_00 coupon as a way of compensation which i thought i would give them one more chance to impress so ordered a light , should have learnt my lesson !
F	will never use this company again
M	i booked and had confirmed a double double deluxe room for 0 adults and a child .
M	the hotel was good with friendly staff , apart_from breakfast host who did not look me in the eye when he spoke to me , and he called me madam !!!
M	categorically no attempt was made and no card was left !!
M	ordered several aurora downlights and kosnic led_lamps online expecting and needing usual delivery within 0 - 0 days .
F	box arrived squashed and message crumpled but flowers intact .
F	i '_ve rung almost every day for a while now and they have been so helpful , so nice and so patient with me .

F	the email explaining the situation was helpful .
M	!
F	i chose envirophone as i wanted a reputable_company as was unsure_about some of the unheard of sites .
F	the surger and the guinness arrived in 0_days , prior to what was estimated by the website .
M	also , the gps system was useless .
M	looking for a new radial arm saw , have used tooled_up before , been happy with what i have ordered and speed of delivery , but this dewalt that i bought was completely_different from the video which was displayed under the caption for the saw i bought .
M	apparently he ' d not seen a fault on this model in the 00 months that it '_s been on the market .
F	easy to purchase .
F	h . watkins . am am not a competitor and i '_m pretty sure that none of the other bad postings are competitors , merely very annoyed , ripped_off people !
F	the rest of the meals were good if a bit boring , the snacks are very good .
F	it '_s been over two_weeks and i still_haven_'_t received my order .
F	i found using the site very easy , good value for money and definitely cheaper_than_anywhere_else .
F	i could have purchased twice the amount of flowers at half the price from my nearest tescos .
M	a big thank_you !
F	the party coming up very soon i had to quickly pick out a different costume with the promise of next_day delivery .
M	we are very pleased with our new oak corner unit and we would definitely buy more furniture in the future .
M	to start with i had heard a number of reviews before purchase which brought me to the site .
M	sent the phone off , and when we called them to find out what was going on , we were told it can to up to 00 days before the get a chance to looke at the phone , a few_days_later my son called again and was told the phone is know worth £_000 not the £_000 stated due to water_damage , which i find hard to beleive as the phone is only 0 months old .
F	overall i would rate 0 / 00
M	- i set a different delivery address to the invoice_address .
F	when i told her i didn_'_t like her attitude , she said she didn_'_t like mine either !
M	yodels tracking_number starts with jd00
M	excellent help given .
M	0_star service !
F	will definitely buy from them again !
M	even_though you are playing less_than the high_street , as much as i have tried to make my new glasses fit me they don_'_t seem to want to stay in shape .
M	i am waiting for the exchange item to arrive .
F	i was in despair , felt unwell and depressed .
F	coming_back one quick call and hey_presto there '_s your car ready and waiting for you .
M	it was marked as being in stock for next_day delivery , then i waited several days and heard_nothing .
F	i received confirmation_email_stating delivery is very quick to stores so orders can '_t be changed .
M	the same products , with same quality and same standard , i '_ve seen else where sold for even low_prices , e . g .
F	all in all i would not fly long_haul with thomas_cook again for the above_reasons .
M	ok , they are usually the cheapest when you ' re after something , especially electronic products .
F	absolutely_brilliant customer service .
F	good service also corrected the order when i got it wrong !
M	i would definitely recommend this company and will likely use them again .
M	hows_that !!!
F	replacements were sent straight_away .
F	taunton_leisure were not very helpful or completly open about the delays .
M	used company many_times with no_problems .
F	instead of us receiving the food we ordered on the saturday , it was monday before it arrived .
M	if you want a customer to post a review now , and dont pay for trust_pilot , then that customer must pre_- register or be prepared to use their facebook account .
M	revisited monday_afternoon as still no contact .
F	i would just recommend in general to be aware of what tickets you are buying and carefully read all the small lines in the terms and conditions !
F	only_suggestion is to add more payment option from other credit_cards provider .
M	they told me that they would call us the day before .
F	my order was finally delivered 0_days after it should of been and i was the last delivery of that day !
M	it was delivered with a dvd cdrw i emailed tier0 asking for a replacement and they did not bother to reply at all
F	i was very disappointed and would not order from this company again !
F	easy to find airparks , we did not have to wait long for the bus to transfer us to the airport and both drivers were friendly and helpful , our car was ready for us to collect despite our flight being early .
F	ordering was easy and it was delivered on time .
F	whilst i appreciate it is not petplanets fault that parcelforce find it incredibly difficult to delivery my order on time , i would expect a good level of customer service and for them to chase it up , after all the delivery company they use can make or break a supplier .
F	amazing service .
F	and it was !
M	this is not cheap chocolate and with p_&_p at £ 0 . 00 and stated delivery of 0 - 0 days , this company isn_'_t performing as well as it could to keep customers , at_least this one , happy .
F	asked for refund having to go elsewhere !!
M	i contacted mr_memory and the response was prompt .
M	needed a new electric hob .
F	there is a great selection of vitamins to choose from .
F	smells of scammy .
M	i have had to chase them repeatedly to find out the current_status and reasons for delay , which was frustrating .
M	whilst this was going on they managed to get the stock delivered directly as the item was a present for my daughter - really did as much as they could to help
M	dont_know who does quality control on these rads but when blanks opened to receive rad valves edges on inside bit rough ie not smooth so need extra attention to prevent weeping . this should not happen on what is purported to be a quality item
M	a fantastic service and recommend to everyone .
M	i '_ve come to the conclusion that there '_s one person out the back making shirts on a loom .
F	now stuck counting_down the month till i can say screw you vodafone .
M	had to contact recipient of order to ascertain if delivery had been received .
F	wonderful experience , thank_you .
F	0 .
F	i ordered two_pairs of fit_flops one beige and one black i opened the brown cardboard_box and inside a lovely bright_red box_containing my beige pair of fitflops tried them on and fit like a glove
M	easy ' ish to fit ( just a bit of a fiddle to line up ).
F	i ordered a lot of beach related items for a beach party , i thought they '_d take a week to come but they came within a couple of days !
F	then was going to leave it up to him to buy games as i cannot_afford them as well .
F	never had a problem with these trousers , my husband has worn them for several_years .
F	i had to return an item because the colour wasn_'_t right .
M	contacted them over live_chat thingy , after a short conversation they told me to try again that everything is fine now lol .
F	was kept waiting 0_days for delivery , had to buy elsewhere , so rejected delivery when it finally arrived on the advice of animed .
M	i sent them a message as someone_else asking if they had stock to which they said they did so i asked them for my grip again .
F	they did not refund any postage either .
M	buy from amazon and stay protected .
M	unfortunately our car this time was dirty in and out and generally below the usual standard we are used to from this company .
F	i was kept_informed about the dispatchand knew when to expect it .
M	!
M	one thing i will be watching out for is the charge on my credit_card .
F	they needed to re - arrange .
F	nice and easy to send of as pre_paid_envelope provided .
M	an_hour later i got a text_message from bt saying , give us a call , we can beat that offer .
F	hi ,
M	this was 00 seconds after she ' d made the booking but apparently it was too late and i ' d have to wait 00_hours to rebook a more suitable time .
F	i am a little disappointed that the ticket i purchased was double the original price .
F	highly_recommend to all of my friends , just continue like this and you will have very successful bussines , thank_you
M	( 0 days_later )
M	price very competitive , jacket was not in stock when i ordered but i was kept_informed re order status by email and it arrived when promised .
F	and to head_office .
F	the assistant i spoke to on the phone was very helpful and set me an online account up with my order in the shopping_basket to check and confirm .
M	the best part was that on the day of delivery an email and text were sent to me with confirmation of time of delivery with a 0 hour_window in my case 00 . 00 - 00 . 00 .
M	!
F	i ordered a pair of ray - ban glasses with my prescription in them .
M	the replacement was exactly the same .
M	within two_days my front off side tyre decided to remove itself from the wheel_rim on the m00 motorway .
M	!
F	was fairly cheap and easy to do .
M	overall i '_m really pleased that i '_ve found this company .
F	really good choice of bright and stylist flowers
F	order from them at your_peril .
F	on a positive_note the pictures themselves are good .
M	generally i would say everything is very good and of course you can ’_t beat them on price .
M	slide on hinge - 000 ° opening - full overlay .
M	the hp 00 black_cartridge arrived and the packaging showed a slight leak of ink .
F	i ordered raw meal from blue_herbs which arrived immediately and is an excellent product !
F	i was promised that the vacuum would be sent by next_day delivery - still not arrived six days_later .
M	the best price i ' d found for arden_grange dog_food , delivery took 0 days , but that was a day faster_than estimated , so very happy .
F	i was absolutely amazed_how much packaging came with a pack of 00 flat back cardboard_boxes - far too excessive and such a pain for a small business customer to have to dispose of as general household recycling collection often will not take such a huge_amount of cardboard and shredded card packing .
F	it seems as they have just sent me a random poster .
M	however , after helping_me find a great phone tariff at the same time as giving me over half of the total monthly_fee back i would strongly_advise you to have a look on this site before buying anything because it is totally worth it .
M	i have been useing banglads . com for a while now and have bought a lot of items from there including underwear and tops , etc .
M	they were delivered right on time and we are told that they were beautiful .
F	my order was dispatched promptly and arrived_safely well within the time limited stated .
M	the follow_up email is also a nice_touch with several contact methods in the case it did not work .
M	recommend you do not send the address_label to avoid_confusion .
M	however they do not accept enough barcodes .
M	' life ' will be much ' easier ' without this sham of a company .
M	i submitted a support query through the website and it took 0 days to get a response .
M	tip_: know what you ' re buying .!
F	a wide_range of goods and of very good quality .
M	so not that personal then .
M	very good , efficient and friendly service . made you feel like they cared_about your order .
F	i would never use rentify again or recommend them in any way .
F	evening meals disgusting mainly .
M	peter cowper
M	i couldn_'_t recommend enough using one of the ' proper ' flower retailers on line rather_than this bunch of jokers .
F	i sent countless_emails over the christmas_period asking for someone to get in touch as it did not mention anywhere on your website that you would be closed ( i assumed that was the case as no one has explained this to me !)
M	they billed me over £ 0000 . 00 for data i didn_'_t use !.
F	i couldn_'_t be in for another delivery to the house .
M	thanks
M	!
M	extremely pleased with the anyvan service and would highly_recommend .
F	the parcel was delivered to my home , then i asked it to be redelivered to my local post_office .
M	i am utterly_disgusted and even more disgusted they will not answer my call and face the music .
F	this being a £_000 floor , that we paid_extra for .
M	the company offer a very good service with fast delivery
M	now i am on worst tariff with edf , not benefitting from dual_fuel discount and i have just about lost the will to live .
M	wanted a groundsheet for a particular tent & i wanted it fast .
F	their phone no voicemail was always full so i could never leave a message .
F	we got a spanish speaker to help us and we found out the so called emergency_number was just a mobile phone turned off .
F	need to learn a lesson from marks and spencer , who do offer the unpacking / removal of packaging service .
M	for all you guys looking for a ring .
F	and i am now for the moment £_00 out of pocket !
F	a huge thank_you to maxim for helping allied healthcare out at the very last_minute with providing us with oscar trophies for our gala evening , very fast turn_around and easy to track on line .
F	first time customer , i ordered a toilet_pan and basin and fixings , however the basin was out of stock and wouldn_'_t be in until the 0th_august .
F	we bought some medical trousers which have not lasted and worn through the knees so we tea trying the red hawk trousers disappointing colour range for women means we have had to order mens ' versions , so far we have had to send some back for sizing and and another pair for a broken clasp - the refunds have come through quickly , but the returns have to be taken to a local shop which has awkward parking and is no - where on our normal errand runs - it would be easier to use the post_office !
F	i had been looking for brown buckwheat to cook in a traditional russian way for a while but could only find its green type until i came_across this site .
M	they damaged 0 of my bags and called them not fit for purpose , even_though they were as new condition .
M	upon_receipt by envirophone i wa informed that one of them had a cracked back , reducing the offer price by 00 %!!
F	large blind sticks and goes squint often .
F	i gave them details and told them it needed to be delivered before 000pm to work address .
F	i was kept_informed by mobile , that the order had arrived , that the order had left the building and that the order had been delivered .
F	they did not arrive until i returned home from my holiday .
F	i phoned to ask for advice and was dealt_with by a great guy_who was extremely_helpful and good fun !
M	i will use them again but another poor experience will be my last with this company .
F	i stayed in all day and when it didn_'_t arrive i phoned the company who told me it could arrive up to 0pm .
M	you wont find a better company on the internet .
M	stung for exorbitant fuel_costs and non - negotiable insurance .
M	item arrived very quickly , well package
F	after a couple of weeks with no communication from the company , i sent an e_- mail asking if they could advise as to when i could expect delivery of my order .
M	i confess i remained somewhat wary about opting for this route , but as i intended to fund the investment by disposing of some shares , i concluded that the risks involved were no greater than investing in the stock market .
M	the hassle was that i didn_'_t realize my us bank did not accept international_transfers .
M	great choice of beers , and now with the new website you know how many they have in stock .
F	its now the 0th_may and they have only dispatched one item .
F	so i joined . for some reason most my retailers don_'_t seem to track and when they do it takes_forever to get payout .
F	i was then accused off ' booking the ticket incorrectly ' by an abhorrently rude customer adviser , so i took a screenshot of the date and price of the train_ticket as advertised on the trainline app .
F	the only_reason i ordered from this website is because i can not find the same invitations anywhere_else but i wont_be using the website again .
M	easy to use & purchase from site .
M	delivery excellent , do not expect as much when returning items .
M	well made and a good addition to your equipment .
F	i think the score is so low because people who had good experience usually don_'_t come to write a good comments but people who had bad_experience coming here to complain straight_away , that '_s why there are so many negative_reviews .
F	you get no way to dispute what they say and they do not actually tell you why they have marked down your goods in the first place .
M	this really isn_'_t good enough .
M	i understand from other posts that they will offer a 00_%_discount ( against what is essentially an over priced product ) but try not to pay , or , if you push for it , a full_refund !
M	0 ) take video_footage and photos of the damage and act promptly
F	my son decided to leave the light in the sun rather_than return it , it took 0_days to dry out , i would have returned it .
F	finally i have been told that it has_been delivered but the packaging is in shreds and the new dress inside is unwearable since it is also torn .
M	.
M	i haven_'_t had the certificate yet from my asbestos course tried_emailing you but no response so not great service still need it
F	i immediately explained the situation with customer_services and after sending a photo to show the damage_caused i was sent a replacement within_00hours !
F	they have never let_me down with an order .
M	however , when part arrived it was a textured bumper , not a primed .
M	won_'_t be recommending anyone again
M	probably the quickest delivery i '_ve ever had from any internet company .
M	the quality of my cast - iron dish is simply brilliant and it complements a further two dishes i have from the same range , which i purchased from a procook shop in fleetwood .
M	this is unusual but can happen if a competitor is unaware of a recent price increase .
M	so i contact customer_services and select another frame .
M	while travel up offered a good price i found the site to be massively frustrating .
F	the office_chair is great when assembled and it looks to be worth much more than it cost .
F	the item finally arrived 00 days after ordering .
F	order arrived as agreed .
M	avis were not interested that i had organised insurance with rentalcars and explained that they would need a 0000 euro_deposit against damages .
F	we placed our order and decided that we did not want to wait for our delivery any longer_than we had to . so we paid for express delivery .
M	i will never use this website again !
M	!
M	we called to check , and guess_what ?
M	item arrived very quickly and as_described .
F	my invitees have commented on them .
M	anyway moving on , as a buyer i recently ordered a football_shirt from liverpool . tv and whilst delivery times were good i was at home on the day of delivery and while waiting for a knock ( i just happened to see him turn_up ) i was able to stand and watch when , instead of knocking so i could answer and take half the time it took him to post it , he proceeded to ram it through .
F	the serenata bouquet was lovely , and my mother delighted - when she eventually got it .
F	!
F	very disappointed with this and i am now looking for another company to purchase from !
M	i regularly order from my protein and find it a excellent reliable service .
M	second pair , more prompt , but unsure_about quality of frames , ok at momemt , but time will tell .
M	tracking service is tip_top too .
F	i was reluctant to deal with the company after a bad_experience two years_ago , but thought i '_d give them the benefit of the doubt - i am now regretting that decision .
F	ok bye now ".
F	both_times i have ordered from pet_supermarket i have had to place an identical order from another company because their service was so slow and i was unable to track where my order was .
M	i highly_recommend deep_blue dive for all dive_gear .
M	easy enough .
F	however , the collection_point turned_out to be argos and my problem_arose when i tried to cancel my order within a day or so of placing the order . first of all i was told it was too late to cancel the order and that i would have to use the returns process .
F	i '_ve ordered my fortnightly disposable_lenses from getlenses for many_years .
F	i would rather pay more money then go through all this hassle !!!!!
F	when i said that if they had responded when i sent the email on saturday then this could have been prevented , they said no one worked on complaints at the weekend hence no response - well if they had set an out of office on their emails i would have know when to expect a response and waited instead of wasting £_00 - so not happy and would not recommend to a friend as i had waited a week in the first_instance as they had not stock and delivery was supposed to be within 0_days !
F	my friends and i had been thinking of fun times when we were younger .
F	i '_ve spent a fair bit of money on finding the right type for me and i like and enjoy a cigeret and i '_ve found them , just not the disposable safecigs
F	excellent service , i will_definately return again .
F	they can '_t get_hold of him but are sure he '_s on his way .
M	i scanned and posted my dvds in a timely_manner .
M	no_hassle , easy to deal with , very professional and business like service i will use them again .
M	product is exactly as expected .
F	very happy with raybans , worried might be fake , but really really satisfied with purchase and service .
M	finally after a number of complaints to the catalogue and the courier , i resorted to contacting the ceo of both companies .
F	i would try a different company due to the length of time the flowers where out for delivery .
F	we had not left the house at any point and definitely no card had been left !
M	unacceptable
F	flight_centre was recommended to me by a friend and i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend them .
F	it arrived quickly and was exactly as expected .
F	if this company takes £_000 from 0000 ( figure as example only , i '_m_sure the turnover is far , far_greater !!
M	it is a very fast and efficient delivery service .
F	i use amazon for most of my internet purchases and have never had a problem with anything
M	we returned it in firenze where the staff were excellent .
M	when i went to have it fitted at national_tyres derby square , isle of man on thursday_morning i was told that the tyre was not actually in stock and would be a couple of days .
M	i made an order 0nd_july on some shoes .
F	as i had ordered 0 items for 0 different people at 0 different times i know that this wasn_'_t a one - off error .
F	that day i received the confirmation phone_call , only to be told that this time only the afternoon fitting was available .
M	definitely a bitter experience
M	it all stinks of misinformation and im none the wiser
F	despite having a miner small piece not perfect where charger connection being perfect ,!
M	you have been_warned !
M	i would definitely use " my tuxedo " in the future and have no_hesitation in recommending them highly .
M	what is not available is any idea if there is a cost for the guarantee , which in their above_statement , suggests is included in the sale price .
F	the sooner the govt reduces the vat threshold so that companies like play can '_t take_advantage of it the better .
F	i had to email them several_times before they clearly told me that i would be expected to pay £_00 for amazon_prime for the year otherwise i couldn_'_t get instant video anymore .
M	a cheaper , quicker , simpler system than wex .
M	i had a lot of trouble getting parcel_force to give me a straight answer on where the package was .
F	i would truly recommend using this company .
F	also there is this business of " anyone at home over 00 ?"

M	they even confirm by text and email .

M	when i finally got through to the advisor on the end of the line , my order reference was taken and then i was cut_off when i was put back onto hold .
M	the claim policy is terrible and does not allow ease of use or an acceptable time to make a claim .
M	once anything gets sucked into it , it '_s nigh impossible to get it back out again ( that '_s the black_hole of course but you see the eerie similarity ).

F	i think the team at viovet are all fantastic and excellent at thier jobs .
F	on a long trip it started to rain but when we put the wipers on we realised the tank for the washers was empty which was annoying and points to sloppy care .
M	e_mailed customer_services explaining the position and asked them to call me back .
M	i can buy items here that i would not buy on other_sites because the addition of delivery charges makes the product too expensive .

F	i purchased a personalised 00th_birthday banner with the theme of doctor who for my sons party .
F	each capsule is encased in a little paper pack which has to be torn_open before you can get to the capsule .
M	secondly the instructions were confusing : the product included a main set of instructions , which don_'_t quite relate to the parts included in the box , since it shows the posts with a ' u '- shaped groove to attach them to the crossbeam rather_than an ' l '- shaped groove .
F	i intend to do this yearly
F	i would recommend this company to anybody .
F	not only was the service received from bride_& groom terrible , but they use yodel as their delivery company and when combining the two , we poor customers stand no chance .
M	then payment sense is the one for you .
M	it wasn_'_t .
F	my order has not even arrived yet so i am very disappointed !
F	we use asda a bit .
M	without going into the details of the process involved in gaining enhancements to my offer , whatever fee michelle earned was more than justified she worked_tirelessly to achieve the successful results making the process entirely painless for me , consequently i dropped the lesser offers from the several other_companies i contacted , and with her assistance successfully concluded a significantly better offer than that from my incumbent pension_provider , i don_'_t know the extent of her working day , but i know that on any occasion that a query popped up she was immediately available to help .
F	i loved the card so much that i have bought the parispass as that is our city_break this year .
M	was kept_fully_informed of my orderr status and arrived within a few_days .
F	so thanks a lot :_o_)
M	makro , without contacting me simply refunded the money for the item without offering me any choice of whether i still needed the item .
F	find these pods make the coffee_machine run really slowly , it takes_forever to make a coffee , they also have a grainy residue within the coffee which i have never_experienced before .
M	i ordered my goods 00th_july , and i still_haven_'_t received them , today it is 00th_july
F	why did it take 0 day to dispatch ?
F	!
M	have been satisfied with the products , prices and delivery times in the past so i '_m willing to put up with difficulties ordering online and the total_lack of a telephone order service .
M	anyone overall the service was okay but i wouldn_'_t spend so much money or something i could have done better myself using a petrol_station or a supermarket .
M	the table needs telescopic locking legs with at_least 00cm range .
F	in the end they shuffled some cars and we went off and came back in two hours - the work was fine and i have no_complaints about their actual work .
F	order received a few_days after i ordered , great prices - much_cheaper_than_anywhere_else i looked .
M	( i purchased my item a long time ago ) the estimated delivery date was the 0th so i waited in all day , no parcel .
M	rang again , and got cut_off after being on hold and talking to someone at the store .
F	so it had all started nice but between the additional flights i had to buy , the one that was canceled and the messed_up refund story , it ended_up not being as pleasant an experience as i expected .
F	men selv pakken_var i meget dårlig stand , det_var heldigt at intet indhold blev tabt .
M	then checked their website which had previously said " out for delivery " to see it had been amended to delivery attempted .
M	they simply told me to return the item to them .
M	a pleasure_doing_business with
F	all in all five_stars plus .
M	many carriers now give approx time slots .
M	reliable delivery
M	i have used me memory before and i will use them again in the near_future .
M	once ordered , the order status page then gave_me 0 - 00 days .
M	i think it was an oil gun that i bought from you .
F	as for compensation , think again , they '_ll try and wriggle out of any such claim .
M	i will be extremely reluctant to use them again .
M	so i ordered the 0 drawer unit from them on 00th_april_0000 .
F	after_spending half hour trying to see exactly_what bargain i might be getting i have finally given up on tesco - totally .
F	we would have appreciated your quality control team telling us it really wasn_'_t good enough ' cos now it '_s the first thing we notice as it '_s ten times bigger !
F	i was worried_about all the forms etc that i may need to complete , along with all the other work that you need to consider opening a new business .
F	ordered a kaftan to match a bikini i bought in the sales last_year .
M	the only thing i would say is that i was not willing just to put my old_iphone in their post bag and drop into a postbox so i opted for special delivery !!
M	i was promised they would be delivered by 00 : 00
F	will be recommending them to my friends and family .
M	i .
M	t - mobile , you are ripp offs we should compensated for are losses and inconveniences !!
F	?
F	so the recipient of the flowers had no idea who they were from which was very disappointing
M	the delivery company , city - link messed_up their delivery because they " forgot to put the box on the van ".
F	but all it said was that the order was finished and had been sent .
M	i can see that i shall have to sue them for the credit as they clearly have no_intention of accepting the fact that i have moved_house nor that i am owed money .
F	chemist_direct covers a wide_range of items all very reasonably_priced and the effiency when it comes to delivery is beyond compare .
M	thanks !
F	they have profitted out of me .
M	the bljnds i ordered arrived on time but not made as i ordered 0cm short in width and very long but i was able to use them after adjustments i should have checked them before hanging them
M	* received a order confirmation_email .
M	i subscribed to lovefilm for quite a while , despite not really using the service to it '_s fullest .
F	i sent more emails and they did not respond till after i had the clothes and they sent an_email_saying out records show you have collected your stuff .
F	i was very very impressed with glasses_direct , they were extremely_helpful and answered my questions very quickly by email and by an optician phoning me at a time that suited me !
F	had to contact the seller twice to explain that they had taken my payment via_paypal but hadn_'_t processed my order .
M	however there was a major problem on delivery , the item i purchased was a 00 year_old gibson_guitar with its original case with a current value of approximately_£ 0000 .
M	i felt_like yodelling someone !
M	ordered laptop and i found the whole service excellent .
M	on receipt we stick these straight into the freezer only to find that when we need to use it , we have to defreeze the entire lot .
F	but .
F	i have recommended glasses_direct to friends and family .
M	their protein_tastes better_than bigger brands i used to use .
F	would use them again .
F	was very pleased with the overall cost of x 0 blinds .
F	being significantly_cheaper_than comparable products available from other online suppliers this rates as a significant success .
F	i wanted the perfect flowers and chocolates delivered , to cheer my daughter along in her battle with breast_cancer .
F	loved this chocolate .
F	this is why we felt it necessary to confirm with your customer service team , who gave_us the wrong information . twice .
M	she took me to see her colleague who looked at me and simply said " no chance ".
F	any yet .
M	i have to say the service is brilliant , i can order my lenses in the quantity i want try new ones without making a big commitment .

F	thank_you so very much !
F	real_shame because the quality of the items ordered was outstanding and a couple of breakages were put right straight_away .
M	they can get you fired .
F	the panels are fairly large 0000 by 0000 and really need two people to fit .
M	very helpful .
M	i was home the whole day the tracking page said they had made an attemt to deliver it and had not been contacted by telephone .

F	the cookware was despatched very quickly on receipt of my order .
M	i was given a gift token for ticketmaster .
F	he said " well we ' re not aircon specialists !!

F	we are an_hour from chester , direct on the a00 .
F	i received items with 00 hr shelf_life , milk that was off , and the birthday order for my mom had no flowers and no substitutions !
F	everything from the prices to the quality of service exceeded my expectations , lets be honest you get one of these calls offering better this and better that , you never actually think its going to be what you get , but it was and more !
M	the delivery was so fast .
M	twice they have advertised that the bike will take no_longer_than 00 days to be stocked and a further few_days to be built .
M	they don_'_t seem to be able to deliver when their website promises and they don_'_t seem to be aware of their broken_promises .
F	having used the internet on many occasions for both large and small itens i have never before had to arrange a return myself .
F	fantastic !
M	i want to enter the recipient email address so they get notification at each_stage of the shipment .

F	guinea_pig food made by excel so great quality but hay i ordered very fine , poudery , very dissapointing .
M	they ' d only accept on a credit_card but i only had a debit_card which they wouldn_'_t accept .
F	i '_m quite disappointed with how this was dealt_with and although i will be encouraging both of my children to attend camp again next summer - i don_'_t think that my son will want to go again :-(
M	i had to pay an extremely harsh £_00 premium to have this delivered at a convenient time ( basically the free delivery is a joke if you do not work at home - be warned ) early one morning - and there is no option to have the delivery made to any address apart_from your own postcode .
M	!
M	- excellent delivery service using dpd ( i . e .
F	nice lady on phone when i rang up and queried returns as ordered wrong_size .
M	i would avoid them .
F	i hate o0 , the customer service team are awful are completely incapable of ever following an instructing or assisting in any matter .
M	they knew how many people had booked , when they were arriving and which cars were needed , yet there were not enough people to deal with this and to have to wait 0 hrs plus to pick_up your vehicle is not good practice .
F	best service i '_ve experienced in a long time .
F	ordering cat_litter - great value for brand that our 00 year_old cat prefers .
F	so , unfortunately i can '_t write a proper review of the airport or it '_s facilities other than check in , security and the loo as it '_s all we had time for .

F	they arrived and were all fully open and dying with some already dead .
M	ordered my tennis_racket online and got it a couple of days_later , packed very well .
M	i will_definitely shop with these_guys again and i highly_recommend their services to anyone and on top of all this they have great stock which just shows me they know what they are doing .
M	i was threatened on the phone that i will not receive a refund if i keep calling them about it , and i was also called a idiot on the phone !
M	seems they '_ve got quite a reputation .
F	as i was buying my bridesmaids_dresses from coast i asked all my bridesmaids to buy one so we could use it - the expiry_date at the top clearly said january_0000 .

M	i had to call a different number and pretend i wanted to buy a mobile_phone package .
F	i said i would get bill from t mobile showing phone_calls made day phone was sent .
F	i '_m surprised they believe they can actually continue trading with such unethical and underhand deception to unsuspecting and goodwill on customers behalf '_s .
M	on the first occasion the order was promptly dispatched and the quality good at the price .
M	the memory arrived in good time and was well_packed but a totally different type !

M	terrible quality shed , flimsy , under - engineered , even worse customer service - they claimed to be very serious about customer service , but basically not interested in my dissatisfaction with their product .

M	instant notification of funds received , and where required , funds immediately transferred .
F	perfect iphone , absolutely no_problems with it , great condition .
M	before it was spotless and efficient unfortunately this new depot was somewhat the opposite , very dirty employees and i had my son with me and the boss was communicating with a customer in hear shot swearing and generally not really bothered my young son was standing practically next to him , very unprofessional .
M	i will almost certainly use this company again .

M	excellent service again ordered friday_morning received lenses saturday_morning using standard post .

F	nearer to the date of delivery you are given an estimated time by email and text .
M	the last car only had the first service done by jennings then i did all the other '_s myself , its cheaper and you know whats done but obviously not everyone can do that .

M	i ordered wok the book to start with as , as far as i can tell this was a fairly new site .
F	as you can appreciate , i am not a professional_photographer , that aside the photographs are a true_representation of the mattress that i received , whether the manufacturer says that this is a fault or not under the sale of goods_act 0000 i am entitled to a full re - imbursement due to the product being i feel not as_described as certainly not of satisfactory quality .
F	there has_been little in the way of an_apology from golden_tours and i have had to contact them twice just to obtain a refund of the ticket price .
M	nothing since - it '_s now 0pm weds 0th .
M	go to another wab site you will be better off .
M	oh and they still_haven_'_t explained why they originally couldn_'_t simply take the items off their website until the payment part of their site was fixed .

M	i get the same oil , from the same drivers , but about 00_%_cheaper .
M	also , they were less then helpful when my sony mp0 failed , they were not interested and said i had to return to sony direct .

F	the online help was good and an e_mail confirmation duly_arrived .
F	i am now sat 00 days_later still_waiting to be refunded !!
F	!
M	recently ordered their j & j wolfe maple small bookcase .
F	good website , straightforward process , happy with the products .
M	do not ; i repeat do not under any circumstance think of dealing_with these jokers .
M	taking into account the bank_holiday that means my order was processed and dispatched in a day .
F	i love the products and the prices however my first order was over shadowed by poor delivery timings .
F	in the meantime , i would strongly_urge_anyone considering buying a car from stoneacre to either sort_out their finances first or take a team of lawyers with you to scrutinise all the smallprint on any agreement before signing .
M	the last review before mine on this site i would hazard a guess they wrote it for themselves due to all the negatives .
F	i was surprised that you had to add veg , fruit and dairy to the diet as i thought everything would be included .
F	i was hugely delighted when i received my photobook .

F	a reminder txt sent to me and a email and they rang the hotel 0_days in_advance to make_sure all booking confirmed and gave_us the name they talked to .
M	i will never use them again .
M	quite fast delivery .
F	i used to sell the odd thing on ebay , but unless i list it as collection only , i usually end up out of pocket on postage , as ebay dictate the postage you can charge .
M	the products are good and the service and delivery great .
M	they have gone out of their way to get my products to me before i race .
F	i i would like to see a free_returns process .
M	i ordered and paid for a nw golf_bag and after a week i get an email to say they don_'_t have the colour i want , why does it take a week ?
F	not sure .
M	the courier man was adament that he would not break down the pallet but would quite happily let one of the office ladys do it !
M	frost stock some great american stuff , which im happy to pay for , rather_than get cheaper from the us ( and then wait longer for delivery ) - but they just need to use a more professional logistics company .
M	most emails did not get a reply .
F	excellent service , product delivered and installed efficiently .
F	i was already disgusted with this company as they failed to deliver my order on 00nd_january and didn_'_t respond to my complaints until 00th_march .
M	good website , good delivery time but shoes did not fit_properly .
F	when i tried to claim for the additional amount i was unable to as more than 000 days had passed since the purchase date .
M	attractive prices , great service , friendly support . definetly shall order again .
M	they are a private company that masquerades as a public entity .
F	the toilet even had poo in it .
M	i stayed in best_western in chicago and it was awful .
F	i am quite disappointed with thw delivery timea from this company compared to other online geoups !
M	the vibrater and double ender are brilliant but the two so called real_life dildos might as well go in the bin to small look nothing like the picture you display sorry phil

M	it goes up and down very smoothly and is highly effective as a blackout .
F	i '_ve honestly had enough , time to see my solicitor i think .
M	rang that number and new phone arrived next_day .
F	so in turn my order won_'_t be here for a max 0 business days .
M	great product at a great price , delivered next_day , thanks for everything
M	a bit_strange since one of the items i was missing was details of an extended_warranty that i was looking to take out with them .
F	i did have problems with the actual products but the customer service was excellent .
M	they wil not get custom from me in the future they can keep prices low as their business appears to be making money with other_peoples money , if not why no refund at the earliest_opportunity ??
F	so i '_m very happy and will definitely use claire flowers again in the future .
M	the parcel was out for delivery on the 0th .
F	on arriving at reus airport , our taxi_driver was outside with a sign with our name on .

M	very annoying !
F	this is the second time i have used this company and again i am very happy with their products and service .
M	it takes 0 days for the parcel to be delivered to uk by usps for a 0000 mile long journey .
F	which , for how long it took me one time to sort it out , isnt worth the time or phone bill .
F	on the website it says 0_days dispatch but this means to the delivery company who then might take another week to deliver to you .
M	asked if this is correct level of vehicle , told yes .
M	i get an immediate email after ordering to confirm the order and usually receive a notice of dispatch within 0 hours after that .
F	when i returned the car there was 0 / 0 of a tank of diesel left .

F	so to get a reply from a machine is totally_unacceptable .
M	it would have been much more efficient had they just said this in the email to begin with .
F	i was very pleased eith the way my order was belt with
F	funnily , you only make contact with a companies personnel when there is a problem , and its at these times , it can make or break your experience .
F	we did this and booked a morning slot and our bed_frame arrived as promised .
F	hope they stick around for another 00 years .
M	they where the cheapest tyres and we got them in 0 days
M	as discussed , the quality of the internet service was frequently extremely poor and we had consistent problems throughout our time with icuk , none of which were identified as issues with our hardware or anything our end .
M	the adhesion was so critical that i had no opportunity for repositioning , i distorted one visor and broke a piece out of the second whilst trying to correct the location .
M	in addition i was told that the shoes would be delivered on a particular day by email only to find that the seller did not even have them in stock on that day .
F	thank_you .
F	?
M	all except no name ' own brands ' were coming out at around £_000 - 000 .
F	often what appears to be a good deal transpires to be the same price as standard or something cheap and substandard put_together for the sake of groupon , i feel this is the fault of groupon mis selling the products .
F	appalling !
F	oh , by - the - way . katie is their online defense .
M	i recently_purchased a high end pair of beyerdynamic_headphones - i called hifiheadphones in advance and talked through my options - they reccommended a pair of headphones much_cheaper_than my original decision - although in the event i went for the expensive ones anyway .
F	thank_you so much for everything that you have helped with me and done for me !
M	maybe a little staff training is in order , or possibly just give them more money ?
F	prompt delivery too .
M	initial date when i contacted customer_services to ask how much longer we were expected to live with 0 of our 0 bedrooms and living_room full up with items from the office area , not unreasonable as so_far our 0 day job has taken 0_weeks and living in this mess is very depressing especially when you read their brochure about their craftsmen taking pride in their work etc .
F	my friend was out and instead of the flowers being left with a neighbor they were left on the doorstep in bad_weather .
F	however i never received the e_- mail telling_me my dispatch no . and that it was on it '_s way .
F	i emailed . no response .
F	couldn_'_t ask for more .
M	i will_definitely be using bodybuilding_supplements again .
M	the 00 pound for quick payments a bit of a downer as i was only borrowing 00 which in actual fact was 00 with the quick payment thing .

M	have heard_nothing since .
M	because of the off - season ( american_football ) i cut my carbs intake and i am doing cardio 0x a week and have a least 0 - 0 hours sleep .

M	then received a text from courier company on the morning of the delivery stating they had not received my item so would not be delivering today ?

M	i '_ve had the misfortune of dealing_with them after buying goods from both ' very ' and ' carphone_warehouse '.
M	no contact with the mods or site owner since saturday - phone has_been missing for over a week !
M	i ’_m sorry to hear that you ’ ve decided to cancel your order , however i can confirm that this has_been done .

F	thanks

M	telephone_call count now at 00 .
F	i ordered a camera worth 0000 from them in september and was advised my order will arrive mid september .

M	their online_chat service is extremely_helpful in cases where the exact part required is difficult to identify .
F	however .
F	maybe not their fault but can be a problem if wanted for a special_occasion , birthday etc .
F	so giving me £_00 . 00 instead which i couldn_'_t be bothered to haggle about .
M	to top off all the good points , the customer service is top_notch also .

F	happy customer , happy dog !
F	have recommended several_times already friendly knowledgeable people always happy to help generally better prices than the vets ( although not always ) generally a quick turnround between order and delivery .

F	!
M	the site is fairly easy to use , better_than all these so called ' chep flight ' sites that just send you to easyjet or ryan_air '_s websites .
F	i think it is unreasonable to expect people to return an item to the seller within 0_days ( 0 working_days ) as it is not enough time to make a decision and post it back .
F	ie .

M	after ordering one of their products they somehow messed_up the delivery address , don_'_t ask me how as the online form was filled in correctly but they say that they used my email address as a postal_address , i mean how daft can you get .
F	they gave_me such a talk about a settings that wasn_'_t even there !

M	i have dealt_with joe before on both buying and selling watches , but not with frank on the antiques purchase , until quite recently .
F	for the past 00 years i have had a vauxhall car , but this time my husband said let ’_s have a look around for something different , so we did , we looked at about 0 different makes of car , then we went to chorley_nissan , and we were treated like customers we looked at 0 different_models , and we test drove them all , the salesman his name was brian had all the time in the world for us , he answered all our questions .
F	!
M	the crew on board were very welcoming and friendly .
F	the flowers were absoutely beautiful - much_better_than i had hooped for and they were delivered very promptly - i would most definitely recommend them and will use again
M	flowers were great , but the box they were delivered in was all bashed and soaking_wet
M	easy to return unwanted glasses , but somehow i ended_up on the us web_site which could of been costly at the postoffice .
M	any decent company would have offered an_hour delivery slot to minimise the inconvenience they had caused .
F	poor attitude from rude staff - who said they did not wish to be rude but .!!!
F	i ordered the item just under a week_ago , the money has left my bank_account and still the item has not arrived despite the website saying it will take 0 - 0_days .
M	my most_recent booking through e_- bookers was substantially_cheaper_than booking through the airline itself , so its a no_brainer really .
F	great website , really user_friendly with some fantastic offers .
F	it '_s not coming tomorrow , it '_s coming thursday .
M	what '_s worse , they failed to pick it up afterwards , twice !

F	it was amazing service and the flowers were beautiful .

F	competitive_prices , easy to use website and free delivery .
M	as on rush to hospital to see mother in law , didn_'_t pick_up that it was the group below , as not mentioned by budget staff .
M	after two_weeks of waiting , i decided to reclaim my money via_paypal and entered a case against tredz , following which i received an email again saying the item was expected imminently and i received it 0 days after that .
F	for those reasons i would be a bit_weary of ordering form the site again or at_least large pieces .
F	i got an_email through to say it had been delivered successfully , i was obviously concerned as as far as i was concerned it hadn_'_t been delivered , i spent a long time chasing it .
F	their opinion once they have you locked in again is " tough "!
F	sleeping involved lying on a hard wooden structure in the centre of the sofabed ; not comfortable for even short_term use .
F	the dispatch and delivery was quick , and the items were well_packaged .
F	he also promised to call me back the following_day .
F	we were informed of the delivery by email and mobile phone from the time the flowers left the building .
F	it was a little annoying to need to re - set the bouquet size to ' standard ' every time to order the right value ( as it defaults to the more_expensive ' medium ') and there was a technical_issue with the message on the final one which for some reason wouldn_'_t ' attach ' to the correct order , but which online customer_services sorted ( took approx 00_mins ).
F	my daughter received her parcel in less days than had been quoted .
F	i visited a store in brecon at the weekend and was impressed by the competent staff and good range of products .
F	to a costa a lot .
F	great value for money .

F	what is the point of ths site if the company who gives bad service or sells rubbish stuff can get the reviews removed ?
M	really great service delivered in a really personal way .
M	so it was going to be more bother than it was worth to send it back .
M	i have been trying to get my game sorted as my cards were not being marked and i could not see what numbers were needed and when anyone won the name was always blurred out .
M	would not allow me to talk and insisted that the matter was closed and they would not communicate further on the matter then began insulting me .
M	i can only think that the managers at the airport are so lacking in empathy with their passengers , that they genuinely have no idea how universally outraged we are at this cynical charge .

M	it didnt look like the picture ( mcdonalds burger moment ) and the wrapping was poor .
F	the product is fine too .
F	did this 0 times , with no luck .
F	this is now the only site i will use for flowers either for work or personel
F	as a result i would like to cancel my order and have notified the company of this .
F	however of late the company is constantly_updating their products and the new models are unrliable and so becoming too expensive to continue with .
F	!
F	not wishing the wrong taps being sent , i immediately called these people on the first working day after the order , ie yesterday mon 0 dec .

F	dont really know what to do next as they dont care .
F	i '_m_sure they would have replaced them if i had got in touch .

M	well_done .
F	the entertainment did over compensate and was very good .

M	this company is run by a bunch of crooks and hopefully they will go out of business very soon and save a lot of people , a lot of hassle !
M	the process to purchase was extremely easy and my items arrived quickly through the courier .
F	have used some of the " big store " flower services in the past but the last couple of times were very badly_let_down .
M	000reg failed to do their job here and try to escape responsibility so they don_'_t need to pay for their mistake .
F	then i couldn_'_t cancel .
M	i ordered an espresso_machine and some cups / saucers and requested that both be delivered together .
F	online seemed easier ( once i had my prescription ) than wandering_round a shop being_pestered by smarmy people in suits ( who never seem to be wearing glasses themselves !
F	i bought the woodland fairy costume its really good looks like it did on the picture and iam very pleased with it .
M	the cabinet arrived in good time and in good condition .

M	when i got back ( 00_mins later ) i had missed the delivery by 00_mins !!!!
F	on the day of the funeral we found that our colour choice had not been honoured on the basket of roses and the thinking of you flowers .
M	rubbish service from beginning to end .
M	i '_ve_used tooled_up before and they are very good but this experience wasn_'_t good at all .
M	they replied back to say they had tested the glasses in their own lab and they were fine and that if i wasn_'_t happy i should take them to my local_optician to check them , they didn_'_t read my letter !
M	i have a black background and we can see a white strip on some pages at the binding .

M	underwritten by very reputable insurer .
M	a simple , straightforward process .
F	after saying they were dealing_with a company who was taking 0_months to pay cashback - they then refused to ensure payment as promised .
M	---
F	so we waited in on the following_day expecting it to be delivered then instead and yet again the parcel was not delivered .
M	my other disappointment was that the website states under the watch i ordered that the watch came with a 0 day refund policy , offering me peace of mind if i needed it .
M	returned shorts at my expense and had to wait another week before my order was finally completed .
M	it was delivered super quick and at a really good price .
F	the courier didnt even apologise , and the response from pet_supermarket was poor !
M	annoyingly some suppliers in their short description said that delivery was free or a set cost which when i went further proved not to be the case .
M	admittedly , we never received email confirmation of the engineer appointment , but the south_african talktalk customer service agent in early september did confirmed the installation time and date several_times over the phone .
F	purchased sleepeeze 0000 pocket_sprung backcare mattress king_size .
M	good service
F	in fact , there were only a few tea spoons - which i find very disconcerting given the fact that we pay a substantial_amount for insurance_cover for breakages etc .
M	el_envio fue rapidísimo .
M	nothing like brochures or booking sites .
M	this meant that i had to pay to make_sure someone was in the office and also then had to pay for a courier to delivery it to site .
M	it is unlikely i will be using mgp again .
F	!
M	paid the day after_posting
F	i have double - checked again now and it '_s not true .
F	the only_reason they have 0_star is because you cant leave a review without leaving at_least 0_star otherwise it would be - 0
M	website was easy to use and the rates were very competitive relative to other online quotes i had seen .

F	thanks !
F	i am a customer of this company for many_years .
M	can '_t do any better_than that .
M	i was notified about prospective_tenants .
F	this gave problems to pensioner customer incapable of lifting heavy goods thankfully
F	so it hadn_'_t crossed my mind until now . how much longer will it take ?
F	whilst attempting to eat our starter we were asked if our food was ok . both my husband and i had our mouths full and therefore did not reply immediately , by the time my husband had finished his mouthful to reply we had been tutted at as if it were us that were being rude for not replying and the waiter was walking away .
M	the price was pretty decent and the staff friendly .
M	always receive great service yet the amount of damaged to orders by the courier lets then down , never received an order in good condition .
M	update 0 : 00 / 00 / 00
F	the prices are also inflated then shows a large discount to bring it back down to what is still more_expensive then most sites .
M	ordered a single ( light ) top and it came in a clear bag within another plastic_bag and delivered when it was said to be .
F	i made three_attempts to return at post_office .
F	i wanted a iphone 0 and put my name down on the website as interested and also in various stores in town including their cw store ( who as with everywhere_else , couldnt really reserve or help as no one knew what stock they were getting )
M	they said it is classed_as a crash so their policy states not allowed help as its not a breakdown !
F	i even phoned to explain to the reception staff what was going on and was informed the boys would be dealt_with and moved out of the dorm - this wasn_'_t done and they continued to make the lives of the other boys in the dorm very miserable .
F	waited in all day till be told the courier had been and didnt have a up to date phone number for me or didnt have company phone !!
F	very pleased with the two barbour_coats i purchased .
M	i ordered my product on a tuesday with hopes of delivery for the friday .
M	when it arrived it was clearly an american import because it had an american 0 - flat pin power adaptor .
M	then i went to cancel the booking that they couldn_'_t confirm and they charge a " penalty " to cancel .
F	easy to do when understanding the inward and outward journeys on the same day .
F	when phoning customer_services was told he was actually in sales !

M	i ordered a florence knoll ' inspired ' soffa and couldn_'_t be_happier with the service or the product .
F	luckily i had some screws of my own to fit the blind .
F	thieves that '_s all i can say . no toy no money and massive telephone bills after a number of phone_calls with no result still .
F	we upgraded again at check in , once we had paid we were told the cabin had gone but they were unable to refund our card .
F	secure because they send sms ( 00 pence price ) to phone of activities
M	would use this company again .
F	in fact , the whole_process could be shortened by reacting quickly , especially when i mentioned i expected the funds to arrive before a certain_date ( deadline ).
F	thank_you ! s
F	the rights were still by pretty_polly , but not control top , and not the same denier .
F	the rug i bought was really good quality for a good price .
M	i '_ve also had similar_experiences to those mentioned by others with this company regarding deliveries .
F	if you ' re lucky_enough to actually receive your parcel , chances are it '_ll be in a sorry_state - everything i '_ve had from them i '_ve returned to sender , probably due to being loaded & unloaded multiple_times from the mystery delivery van ( s ) that operate through edinburgh city_centre .
F	very fast delivery service and a very reasonable_price , able to track the parcel and know when its being picked_up and delivered .
M	having rearranged a whole day to receive delivery after receiving a text saying it would be delivered today ( no time frame whatsoever ) i contacted them on an 0000 number , which is now not supposed to be used legally for after - sales or customer service , to be told that they could only tell me " sometime before 0pm " unless i call back after 00 .
F	this too developed a fault and was clearly unfit for purpose , after negotiating with expansys for quite some time on how this would eb dealt_with i agreed for them to process another repair , with a replacement item being provided if this was unsuccessful .
F	i should be able to track when the prescription i posted in was received by pharmacy0u and when my order was due to be despatched and actually despatched .
M	a charming_young_lady promised to find out and phone me , but didn_'_t .
M	i feel olotels were too slow to act and this is why i lost out .
M	the help from nadine ( i think that was her name ) was very good .
M	however in an email from a different yodel employee i was told the latest for collections was 0pm so as far as operating times is concerned with this lot it '_s anyone '_s guess .
M	if you want a reliable ebay_seller , use them .
F	today is february 00th and they have still not arrived .
M	buy your favourite spirits here and you ' re sure to find many new favourites in the process .!
M	prices are also very competitive .
F	best price i could find any where , delivery was as it said on the web_site .
F	i have ordered lots of items from jessops in the past , but never again .
M	the first email said that they had been delivered .
M	very well_packaged to stop any damage from occurring .
F	thank_you .
F	they did exactly_what they said they would in the time they quoted me , and it has a money back guarentee !!
F	i emailed sportsbikeshop and then called on the tuesday . my call was picked_up on the second ring .
M	best place for buying loake .
M	i have taken out a policy but no details of my logins etc . seems to be struggling to get details reset / resent as well !.
F	he was very unapologetic and didn_'_t seem to care about my loyalty to the company .

M	bali hai bought for the wife for valentine '_s day .
M	both the product and the delivery were exactly as_described .
M	the prices are amongst the best available .
F	hard to beat .
F	it said it was out of stock but more were on the way .
F	after 0 stressful months i have tried to close the account to find that they have well over charged me and getting a refund is beyond a joke .
F	i cannot quite see what would justify such a price hike as i thought they were already pricey .
M	topcashback may be fine if you are only wanting to get a small_amount of money , but once you start_earning larger_amounts they will find a way to scam you .
F	i am very pleased with this product .
M	definitely support these_guys , they ' re a great bunch and always very helpful .
F	found the website really easy to use and the sign is even better_than we could have hoped for .
F	as the event was my daughter '_s ' prom ' and she was leaving the school at the end of the term i felt obliged to purchase a photo for her so chose the better of the two taken of her .
M	however , person delivered item to next door as did not bother to ring the doorbell , made extra work and inconvenience for everyone .
M	avoid if possible to avoid_disappointment !
F	also under the distance_selling act i have the right to cancel my order without_incurring charges as the item is still in their warehouse and has not been delivered to me , also nowhere on the website or in our contract does it state cancellation charges will be applied if you cancel the order .
F	although the phone was not the replacement phone was not the one i signed_up to they refused to remedy the situation but said i would have to pay a cancellation_fee if i wished to end the contract .
M	well i keep getting used to good ' ol facebook , then they go along & change it every few_months .
F	i was really pleased with my purchases !
F	he could only have been sat outside !
M	i contacted talktalk after 0 months of this poop and they where completely cooperative saying they understand it was their mistake , they will cancel my contract without having to incur any early cancellation_fees , they would send me a bag and all i had to do was send them their tv box .
F	couldn_'_t get near for ages , then we had to rush .
F	we stayed at the kresten royal at rhodes for a week in early june_0000 and had a fab time .
F	i just hope i do it justice when i wear it to my first ball :)
F	great stools , practical and easy to clean
F	we were unable to straighten some of it
F	not acceptable at all
M	ordered the goods as i thought it was a good deal .
M	i bet after a few_seconds , this comment will be deleted because trustpilot is also an unmanned system , no body is ever checking .
F	have been taking cod_liver oil for years . but for me this pure fish_oil is so much_better .
M	recommended to family as well !
F	my package should have arrived yesterday , instead it is still sat in the shop where i dropped it off on tuesday .
F	didn_'_t manage to get_hold of customer_services before alternative flight so rebooked with fhr in the hope that i could get a refund on my return .
M	i informed them that they hadn_'_t and now , 0 month later i am still_waiting for their reply .
M	one of the few places , i found on line with the product i wanted ; although hardly a bargain .
F	i was fuming , so returned to the shop and after i explained to a sales_assistant , my discovery , they apologised and gave_me my money back .
M	excellent product at a very reasonable price .
F	she ensured that i had enough to see me through to delivery .
F	i bought a set of door furniture in polished brass , it arrived within 00_hours and was excellent quality at a reasonable_price , far better_than your average diy_store .
F	when the costumes arrived they had sent completely the wrong product .
F	very good and safe to do
F	the lady got her flowers and was pleased with them which was what was important at the end of the day
F	customer service is worst than the hell .
F	loved the flowers but considering we paid the extra for a ' deluxe ' bouquet , disappointed with the size - dread to think how few there would have been if we '_d gone for the standard one - certainly didn_'_t look like the advertised picture !
M	in fact on most occasions they have beaten my high_street agents to the let so i will_continue to recommend .
F	they keep offering me vouchers but i would never ever use this company again .
M	will use again !
M	00_hrs .
F	problem was the actual items - i ordered 0 but had to send 0 back as it '_s not as large as it appears .
M	would have no problem using these_guys again !
F	couple days for it to be delivered .
F	she has phoned and said it is the best thing ever , the baby snuggles in and is very content and never moves .
M	i tried twice to telephone them but waited so long whilst listening to their telephone advertising telling_me how good they were that my phone eventually cut_off .
F	i sold 0 phones .
F	i have recently used uk spares a lot and each time , ordering was straightforward , prices were reasonable and delivery was quick .
M	superb !
M	extremely let_down by a company that i always recommended to people to use , left to wonder should i be shopping at cycle surgery , evans , etc where at_least i can talk to a person for the more_expensive items .
M	when i did finally hear from you all you did was make excuses and say anything to get out of sending replacement flowers .
F	would thoroughly_recommend atlantic_signs .
M	there is no value in tesco and no respect for customers .
M	they do an outstanding job of customer service , this a complete service .
M	when i bought my motorhome it was fitted with winter_tyres , which is great in winter .
M	placed order on my i phone at breakfast on the wednesday .
F	good value with no_hidden_extras .
M	one thing they must change - given that the privacy is rather important subject these days i hate the fact that every item you click on has the name of the item in the url too - hardly private browsing .
F	your customer service has_been appalling .
M	nevertheless the experience was positive overall simply because the staff_member was so helpful , and we also got a good deal on the day .
F	order online & the food is delivered to my door the prices are very reasonable compared to buying from my veterinary_practice .
F	so very disappointed !!!
F	my husband is delighted with his veloped as it will help him maintain some mobility much longer , he feels ' bjorn ' again .
M	yes it does the job yes the car was clear with nothing to report but at a cost of £_00 for nothing to report i think is expensive .
F	i was promised a call back before they closed at 0 . 00pm this evening to see if they could get something delivered today .
F	i paid a large_amount for next_day delivery for the privilege .
M	they never once were understanding or apologetic and simply kept telling_me it was not their fault .
M	are they going bust ?
F	my mother then explained again and again and still gave her the same answer .
M	i ordered a large bouquet of flowers and my fiancée had a small bouquet of flowers delivered .
M	like others here , i was tempted by the cheaper prices ( typically around 00p / pod cheaper compared with nespresso ) but sadly the difference in quality was too great and i ended_up returning my order to the fine_coffee_club .
F	have you even looked at your_own reviews on here ?
M	we booked the full day tour .
M	i live locally to their facility and always pick_up ( even_though they will deliver ) and the place is immaculate .
F	thank_you for excellent service .
M	delivery men saying that they knocked when they didn_'_t , leaving expensive goods literally on the door_step , despite the fact the path across the front of our house is used by everyone living on the street , and even deliveries not showing up at all .
M	this seems to just be a scam company offering next_day delivery fot mothers_day .
M	yodel are a hopeless delivery option sadly .
F	i used to love the bbc but lately i would not trust anything they say .
F	a very satisfied_customer indeed .
M	excellent service all_round .
F	very disappointed because all my previous experience with this company have been excellent its a shame they just couldn_'_t refund the postage knowing i have bought the bigger_size and now i have to alter myself to fit the large measurement sizing all wrong !
M	top quality and good service .
M	elegant website .
M	on arrival 00 . 00am arrival in poland after 0 . 00 am departure from home in uk offered suzuki_swift .
F	i found the inks took longer to arrive than others i have ordered .
M	tel : 0000 000 0000
F	they even took away the packaging we no_longer required .
F	i followed their instructions , went to their website , paid the toll , and arranged for next_day delivery .
M	overall , i would have to think long & hard before using them again .
F	they replied they were waiting for them to come in .
F	i would definitely recommend them
F	very impressed with the service and would use them again .
F	seriously !
M	shocking customer experience .
F	i thought the company was very quick with its delivery and the price was excellent .
F	they get you from point a to point b and if you have a calm crossing that is always a bonus .
M	really good job , on price , on time and on my drive .
F	my parcel is now lost , and as the sender was myself when i still lived in australia , there is no sender to take care of the package when it arrives .
M	just a great great easy and fast service , used twice_now , never an issue .
M	?
F	the lamb dish was nice but very similar to a tinned curry from marks &_spencer .
M	can '_t ask for any more !
M	personally , i wouldn ’_t chance it .
F	how convenient .
F	some of the packets of cereals were quite damaged , obviously what was inside was ok but a bit dissapointing , doesn_'_t look quite so nice a squashed ripped box sat on the breakfast table !
M	but it could have gone_wrong spectacularly .
F	they clearly only want good reviews on there !
F	found this site by_chance & so glad i did .
M	good on overall weekly_shop it stock most brands friendly staff
F	within a few_days of wearing both items they became pilled and began to lose their shape .
F	refund will apparently take around 0 to 0_days . don_'_t yet know if that will happen smoothly .
F	this time the plant was bushy and looked good in the box until i unwrapped it , it was leggy and strained , but worse_than that , it was so dry i could pick_up the plant in a two litre pot with one finger easily , all the leaves were like tissue_paper and most dropped_off .
M	did have reservations due to not knowing what quality oil will be used , after booking in my car to find out i will be needing 0 litres of oil of which they use the best quality oil , i think i have grabbed a bargain .
M	came with a power_lead , but did not come with a lead to connect the monitor to the tower .
M	dean baker
M	grrr .
F	very disappointed .
M	i identified the nextbase click and go 0 dup as it appeared to be the safest , most convenience portable dvd_player for in - car use .
F	in 0000 the one thing we were looking_forward to most was a holiday .
M	would recommend the service and will do
F	i then asked to speak to a manager but they left at 0pm .
M	what i received from easylife on the 00 oct_0000 was a 0 piece set # 0000 , - same price .
F	sorry but i wouldn_'_t use again .
M	as they charge interest daily , by them refusing to take your payment because of their system problems , you '_ll pay more interest as items are charged from the date they appear on your account , so if it takes you longer to get your money onto the account they are raking up even more interest and its not your fault their systems fail .
F	shop at amazon e_bay etc .
M	sixt need to look at team training before putting employees on a busy front_desk .
F	xxxxxxxxxxxx
M	hi
F	unfortunately i think the lifespan will not meet expectations .
M	the price on the website was also nearly_half of the other tour companies .
F	!
F	now was the the van_driver or not ?
M	would definitely buy from this company again .
M	i '_ve ordered from selectspecs three_times - not sure i '_ll try again .
M	the other two for the same price tend to give you a room with breakfast
M	i suddenly_became i real victim that has no power to do anything about it at the point , i said i don_'_t want the car and the lady threatened me that the 00 £ i paid in initially will be gone for good !
F	after point_blank refusing to help in any way , ignoring my pointing_out how they '_d said they were resolving it . it had been paid anyway .
M	my most_recent order took five working_days from dispatch .
F	i chose the glossy_paper and was very pleased with the quality .
M	only 0_stars though as valve supplied (' essential extras ') cannot possibly fit the single radiator supplied - had to purchase a different type of valve .
M	what a selection .
F	it took two emails to finally get emailed a return certificate .
F	same day transfer but will cost £_00 . 00 - customer service difficult to get_hold off and they took too much from my bank_account - still_awaiting reply about this .
M	so i won_'_t be going back .
M	avoid this company like the plague and ensure you do full back ground checks before you sign anything .
M	all in all rentalcars . com is a service i ' d use again .
F	however i '_m still annoyed from before .
M	so i started building it again only to discover the same problem .
F	why on earth should i pay the trainline for making a mistake ?
F	but tesco be warned if you decicde to change ostley cafe .
F	emailed to hear that my order hasn_'_t gone_through .
M	best price available .
M	so either the wrong part was ordered or a mix_up caused a different part to be delivered .
M	having seen the ao . com adverts about speedy delivery i searched out the one i needed on their site and found it just as competitively_priced as elsewhere .
F	cancelled my order in the end , though i had to go to group on for the voucher and them for the delivery fee .
F	to make_matters even worse , the guy_who collected my stuff and basically must have taken it home for 0_days appeared at my door with an item i '_d ordered from amazon , and denied everything when questioned about my missing paintings .
F	we were left to wander and look around and this was one reason we went back .
F	lets_hope the refund is as quick as the delivery .
M	this time i needed to speak to the central call_centre .
F	don_'_t even get me started on the customer service in store as well .
M	it took me less_than five_minutes , which isn_'_t bad considering there was " no access "!
M	surely the courier should have notified you that they could not complete the delivery ???
F	there was never any contact and i was never told why they hadn_'_t gone and no apologies .
F	they might be her procedures but i had received a delivery and paid £_00 for goods i had not received .
M	i was impressed by the range of poles available and purchased two leki poles , which were considerably_cheaper_than the price proposed by the shop i visited in bristol .
F	thank_you
F	appalled at the customer service , i bought an item in store as a gift it was the wrong_size , so i went back to exchange for larger_size there were none available in store but it was available on line , but the store could not order from online or transfer stock from another store , so all i could have was a credit_note which i could not use online either , i just had to hope that the size i required came in stock at the store .
M	the small complaint i have is that i couldn_'_t track the product when it arrived in ireland .
F	bank say card not blocked company not processed properly .
F	!
F	received a phone_call today advising that the seats we have reserved have fallen through but they were able to offer alternatives .
F	gumtree value a customer ’_s purse , but short - change you on every_single aspect of customer_satisfaction .
F	this time the customer service representative sorted my order in a couple of minutes .
F	.
M	i have placed 0 orders with wbn to date , 0 of which where processed speedily and were exactly_what i needed .
M	at this point i asked for a refund and was told that a refund would be processed immediately .
F	i am so so disappointed in the service received from your company , that i am also
M	excellent service from order queries to delivery .
F	a good choice of frames and quick service , but i wouldn_'_t use again because seeing a picture on the internet isn_'_t the same as seeing the real_thing .
F	one of them only serves drinks , the other serves food as well .
M	then i receive this survey !
M	easy to use website good choice of flowers at reasonible prices .
M	i fell in love with mandarine napoleon many_years_ago while living in belgium , but had been unable to find it anywhere since returning home .
M	nothing .
M	seamless_transaction , quick delivery , would definitely buy from this company again :)
M	delivery was slow and so the food was cold
M	good independent booking system for all those cheap hostels .
F	glasses tend to arrive quicker_than from high_st optitions .
F	well they arrived the day of her_birthday and had to be taken in by a neighbour .
F	was told " by 0pm " and given the number for the delivery company .
F	this company needs to get their act_together , i '_ve been tracking my parcel from the beginning of when it got shipped , as soon as it hit this uk_based company things just went to the dogs !
M	flowers were not as per picture on web_site .
F	the quality of the on - board service varies from excellent to appalling , depending_on who is in the team .
M	well_done o0 .
M	my order was acknowledged and dispatched on the day that i placed the order , monday .
F	after my order had gone_through i was informed my item was out of stock & it would be back in stock in two_weeks .
M	i contacted them again by which time it had been a total of thirteen days to process the order , a credit was paid into my account within a few hours of me chasing it up .
M	0 wasted queing phonecalls - last not ar desk
F	i called the firm the next_day and the man on the phone seemed quite sorry but not that surprised .
F	furniture was as ordered . most dissapointed by the fact that the delivery guys did not
M	i ordered something from them having seen their website states 0 - 0 working_days delivery at a cost of £ 0 . 00 .
M	good value for money but always look for a code on you account you can get it cheaper if you do ,
F	due to a mistake on their part , delivery was unsuccessful and they were ultimately threatening to charge me £_00 for failed delivery - completely denying that the fault was theirs .
F	the website is easy to use and you get a realistic preview of your sign .
F	we ordered a sofa from argos and was informed it would be delivered on the 0th of december_0000 after waiting in all day and with no contact from argos themselves we eventually rang there 0000 higher call charge customer service centre .
M	if you need a pen , log_onto cult_pens and order from them .
M	why should i be banned for something out of my control ?!
F	i didn_'_t find this acceptable and demanded a payment for my refund ( as they normally take £ 0 off you for refund ).
F	when i pointed_out that my dog couldn_'_t wait that long for her meals he , at my suggestion , split the order in 0 , sent me a confirmation_email of what we had spoken about , and sent the dog_food out so that i received it the next_day .
M	i even allowed an extra 00 days from order date before i needed the card .
F	excellent communication and speedy delivery .
M	i emailed explaining what had happened and they were quick to return the money .
F	they are well made , adaptable and the customer service on the website was fine .
M	i placed an ad on anyvan . com asking for a quote and within 00_hours had received a number of quotes which were * much * more reasonable than others i ' d already got .
F	if it had the whole booking i would have spotted the mistake .
M	we use interparcel most days , and they always deliver a consistent value for money service
F	at 00 : 00 there was no sign of her and i then received a call from mopp to say that she was lost .
F	this made me feel bad for her , as next year she may not be with us .
F	i was sure this was a mistake as i read the imei_number directly off my phone anyway
M	why would twice as many valentine '_s flowers make up for it , when it '_s not valentine '_s day any more ?!
M	luckily i made the flight wih about 00_mins to spare once i ’ d cleared the queues at check in and security .
F	they were able to deliver on a saturday and i received a text from the driver in morning stating what time the would deliver between , then a call saying hey were 00_minutes away .
F	so i will be giving them a lot less business in future and recomed other people who use them to think elsewhere for there supplies .
F	ten days_later i received an_email from music_magpie stating that my item had not been received my them , and asking if i had decided not to sell .
M	homebase website had a deal on a pressure_washer at a competitive price .
M	if you look them up on companies house , you '_ll see that they change registered address several_times from warwickshire to essex to london , the directors and secretaries are appointed then resign the next_day .
F	i had been thinking_about having_laser_surgery for a long time but had been very apprehensive .
F	that '_s fine but it hardly answered my question .
F	old_fashioned family fun and interaction to be had .
M	only problem this time was that i agreed with you that the item could be left in our garden and i would leave a tarpaulin out to cover it in the event of rain .
F	first of all , i have my own problems , i don_'_t want to hear yours .
M	i have been a catalogue customer for a number of years and yodel took over the courier service .
M	dont_think you can get better_than that .
F	easy to personalise invitations with designs for every_occasion .
F	i was informed that a new order would be raised but would take another week .
M	it has now been added to the works blocked sender '_s list .
F	can '_t afford another hotel after forking_out £_00 .
M	delivery drivers moaning_about taking items upstairs this was promised in store they would delivery straight to the room .
F	i contacted customer service who ignored my emails , until they recieved 0 emails from me theye eventually replied .
M	martin lawrence
M	i rang the office at 0 . 00pm and was advised that the item was out for delivery but as they were using a 0rd_party courier it wasn_'_t trackable but should arrive that day still .
M	it would help if you were automatically logged in as a rewards club member , also if it held your credit_card_details so you don_'_t have to input them every time
F	real_bargain and quick delivery - recommended !
F	easy to use website , from placing the order to receiving the items was 0_days of which 0 were the weekend .
F	there weren_'_t even enough seats for everyone and not enough staff to cover .
F	ordered 000 personalised xmas cards which are great and arrived 0_days_later .
F	i will never book with you again .
M	purchased some usn_protein_powder and was very pleased with the service i received .
M	if i was honest i would recommend this company to my best friend or my worst energy .
M	that was nearly 0_weeks_ago now and i have sent another 0 emails to which i still_haven_'_t heard_anything .
M	the mattress was sent out on time , we received an email detailing everything including the expected delivery time ( a 0 hour_window ), the mattress turned_up on time and was in perfect_condition .
M	why sell these products without checking them first ?
M	i suggested evans pay the full £_00 . 00 for the new chainset as they should have installed new pedals , but they have only agreed to a small discount for the time and inconvenience_caused .
M	i have previously had good dealings with this company and really do admire the ethics and enthusiasm of the founder .
M	so after about 0 hours on the phone and 0 emails i have been told that it '_s not there problem .
M	you need to tighten up the whole of this element of your offerings / sales administration pronto !
M	dont wish any bad on some people but go_bust your rubbish .!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
M	buy products but pushy on insurance , i feel that information they give out is incorrect as actually confirmed with samsung re their warranty they stated that samsungs warranty isn_'_t worth paper wrote on just for inherit problems not right as confirmed with samsung 0 year_warranty is a strong as any warranty , apart_from that prices not bad

F	have never been spoken to so rudely by a retail worker and will never cross that threshold again !
M	unable to obtain the licence required to play prtected content .
M	both products are what we as a company required and were well_packeged and delivered in time .
F	" we are sorry that your cashback with **** is taking longer_than_expected ." frustrating .

F	it came extremely quickly , is fantastic quality , and is in bulk .

F	so stupid .
M	we are not a restaurant and have a problem as to how to eat all this chicken within . say 00_hours !
F	i even unchecked the boxes and was still charged for them .
M	i called to ask if the rest was on back order to be told the warehouse had incorrectly listed the products and that it should be 0 times the price .
M	this is a total_joke and basically i feel robbed , i have no idea when or if i will receive the goods , they have however refunded the express delivery fee . wooopdy doo .
F	twice !
M	tc
F	had to pay £_00 for customs_clearance before item could be cleared for delivery .
M	great man and great website .
M	the blind needed to be screwed into the window frame which is naturally a hard wood and needed a fair degree of force .
M	some are helpful and polite and some are not !!
F	i notified customer_services and because they are so awfully inflexible , i was told that i had to wait_until the parcel had been missing for 00 working_days before anybody was prepared to help me .
M	still , no delivery but the usual update message " will be slightly_delayed with shipment till ."
F	the how to assemble video is a brilliant idea .
M	if i would not they told me that they have to reserve deposit 0000 eur at my account .
M	people said try trade_centre wales for a good car , so i did .
F	bad_experience but it was dealt_with quickly and nicely so i '_m placing a new order tomorrow with my discount_code and hoping there '_s no_issues at all this time !

M	had orders for 0 cartridges . they gave_me 0 !!!

M	also the drivers seat now doesn_'_t click into position without a great push or it frightens some poor learner to death when it suddenly bangs into place at some in - opportune moment !!
F	i got a phone_call within 00_hours to say the shoes had arrived in my nearest_store and it took 00_minutes to collect them .
F	very prompt with delivery and they keep in touch , letting you know the status of your order .
F	nothing bad to say .
F	i recommend this retailer to everyone and i will certainly be using outdoor_kit again .
M	wont recommend
M	shopping was easy and delivery to another country very swift .
F	staff are knowledgeable and can give sound_advice and competitive_pricing .
M	i had a query about the number of drivers and my telephone_enquiry was courteously handled .
F	my old option is to go to the store and have it out with them .
F	jo the customer service agent couldn_'_t email me the instructions i now have to wait for them to be posted !
F	realistically , we were not going to use the car much more than that in 0_days and yet i had to pay for a full_tank of diesel .
M	i really was very impressed !
M	the confusion was the sign over one part of the office desk that stated in english and spanish ,. " cars without_reservation " together with ,." express service " " priority check in ".
F	in the end i left my husband to wait alone while i checked our_luggage in .
M	the cartridge sent didn_'_t work .
M	the protein_works answered all my questions , before i even registered with them .
M	the gadget / device must be fully_functional
F	i was pleased enough with the efficiency of delivery and the amount of flowers in the bouquets but quite disappointed with how both bouquets were arranged .

M	speedy delivery and excellent communication of what was happening with my order
M	shopped_around and around to get a better deal and still came back .
F	yes .
F	i ordered a jacket and was told it would be 0days delivery .
M	thank_you for a good service .
F	company who sold table very helpful , advised on type of table we had chosen made some suggestions that we may be purchasing the wrong type of table for purpose , had no_problems with service at all , until delivery , delivered by 0 lazy oafs who refused to move the table into the school left it propped against a fence on full_view of public and unsecured , shook his head that we actually wanted him to carry the table into the school , they were useless and unfortunately let this company down , i dont_know how much you pay for delivery but i would consider_changing as they let your excellent service completely down , as i will not consider your company again untli you change the delivery drivers .
M	some small issues after completion , bbe weren_'_t interested , they had their money and won_'_t like to upset the developer possible loss of new clients no doubt .
M	i got no answer .
F	we purchased the bunkbeds after much deliberating and are thrilled with them .
F	also the tracking makes it easy to keep track of the test .
F	they say it is usage . i laughed the house down when they told me that but after the laughter came the anger and disgust .
M	kybotech put all_sorts of obstacles in the way to avoid paying a refund .
M	i left a message .
M	not impressed
F	i have been using energy companies for 00_yrs and have never been anywhere_near close to this experience .
M	i accepted delivery as i thought it was my other phone from orange ( which turned_up about 00_minutes after the e0 phone ).
F	he had offered to come_back later and called me to confirm that my package was safe .
F	after three hours (!)
M	should be ok as they are munro .
F	disappointed the item i really wanted wasn_'_t in stock ( despite plenty of stock showing online ), particularly as this was my first order .
M	better_than most of them but if you telephone them prepare to wait for an answer about 0 to 0 hours
F	which – to their credit , we received .
M	the amazon website is excruciating to use , the streaming content has many titles that are charged for in addition to the streaming subscription charge , amazon made seperate charges for the streaming service and billed another credit_card for which they had the details for from purchases i had made from them in the past which is outrageous ( i wasn_'_t notified of this and only found out by chance ).
F	very good choice of products , speedy and reliable delivery and really good customer service .
M	le_prix du transport assez élevé et_la pub faite autour de_l ' envoi en 00h00 si avant 00h00 n ' a pas été respecté .
M	the washer was good value , delivery was free and they took my old one away .
M	other than that great company , delivered on time and diamond is as they said it is .
F	pet_supermarket did resolve it for me , but , will i use it again ?
F	however it isn_'_t what i paid for .
M	please be aware of a0b transfers tunisia , we nearly missed our flight because a0b transfers never turned_up to take us back to the endifa airport from our hotel in sousse , we had a pre_- booked taxi , my wife rang the number of there return booking lines to confirm our return travel over 00 times and no one ever picked the phone up , then we rang the emergency_number after about 00 times someone answered and said ring back in 00_minutes cause it is lunch time , of course we rang back after another 0 times they picked_up the phone , we arranged our taxi at 00 . 00am outside our hotel the following_day , of course we were there at 00 . 00am , by 00 . 00 no taxi , by 00 . 00 no taxi , so we rang the emergency line and a0b transfers said 0 minutes , we waited another 00_minutes , by this time it was 00oclock , our flight was at 0pm and we had over 00 klm to travel to get to the airport , so we rang the emergency line again and a0b transfers said one minute , of course we waited another 00_minutes and nothing turned_up then just in case another 0 minutes lie after lie after lie , in total we waited 00_minutes for our pre_- booked private_taxi and it never arrived , so we had no choice to flag down a taxi on the road side at great expense , we of course will never use this company again , thank_god there is web sights like this where you can warn_others , please be aware , if we can help one person not go through what we did then we will be happy .
F	the extinguishers were fine but i ended_up having to be housebound for 0_days because tnt didn_'_t deliver or communicate a delivery time until nagged .

F	i was in !!!'
M	don_'_t think i '_ll be having any more .
M	the order confirmation said they were " in the dispatch process to be delivered shortly 0 - 0 working_days by courier " at point of order which was rather mis_- leading .
F	to say that i was disappointed would be an_understatement .
F	extremely disappointed !!
M	they need to see almost perfect english / german / italian / whatever the language may be , if not it can be very easy to get confused .
F	i gave 0_stars because they show that they care about customers satisfaction .
F	i would like to comment on the quality of the goods if only my basket were to arrive .
M	delivery firm need to take more care loading the lorry and homebase need to improve the online order customer service .
F	the last train from glasgow to edinburgh leaves at 00 . 00pm ( 00 minute journey ).
M	very good and nice site .
F	i would normally expect some positive_feedback from the recipients but i have only heard from one whose flowers were very poor quality , with some stems broken and blooms " nearly dead " - very disappointing and a poor reflection on the charity '_s intentions .
F	i bought the regency boy costume - it stated white shirt with collar , actually received a collar .
M	i googled caa easa atpl licence cover and i ordered the item on the page shown in my web_browser .
M	!
F	i really like the blinds we have received although i am a little disappointed in the fittings as they don_'_t seem to work as smoothly as i would like , but the actually look of the blinds are great , exactly_what i was looking for .
F	for the flowers to be left_outside the front_door after not waiting was unacceptable , as clear_instructions were given to leave them with the next door neighbour if the recipient was not in .
F	i ordered the flowers quite late at night .
F	in the end we had to get the coach home .
F	could you please find out and let_me know .

M	also no replies from there customer emails .
M	dog arrived , but unfortunately the pegs to secure to ground had not been sent .
M	for anyone_else considering using these_people , please seriously_consider whether its worth it .

M	needed photo_book to celebrate son '_s 00st .
F	one for myself , two for other family_members .
F	very pretty , but not what i was looking for at all .
M	when opened there were bits and paperwork ( reg docs etc_.)
M	they then inform_me that there is nothing further that they can do and that this is now an insurance claim , i advise them that this is not an insurance case and that this is fraud and ask what they are going to do about it , i am informed to take it up with the insurance department so the buck is passed on further and i , my business and my customer can go and get *******
M	it was the first time i had used jokers ' masquerade to buy a costume .

F	, goods of a high_quality can '_t wait to see the childrens faces when they see what they will be using at my party ( pirate ship food trays for the boys and princess coach for the girls .
M	the website is functional and with patience one can usually find what one wants .
F	they are worse_than useless to speak to , don_'_t care at all about customer service , i wish they could be closed_down .
M	they could try to reduce the price of their products .
M	i called the store and was advised that a 0 week lead time was required because the items are made to order .
M	i have rang them twice and they take_forever to answer ( just like an energy company ) and then having taken the order on the phone , they can '_t take a cancellation .
F	my partner is serious ill and stuart may who managed our case was excellent .
M	i '_m still_waiting for an explanation and maybe for some compensation .
F	the bottom line is talktalk staff don_'_t give a %!!
M	you people are the scum of the earth
F	its a waiting game .
M	learn something from this folks , when this company mess up they will not take responsibilty .
M	overall we were really pleased with the quality of the everything and found that the cost ( especially the low delivery charge ) was much_better value than high_street alternatives .
F	contacted the company to be told they couldn_'_t find the address !
M	i asked why they hadn_'_t rung me to find out where i was .
M	i would definitely recommend using .
M	my outgoing car was collected on 00th_february_0000 at 00 : 00 , my new car was delivered on the same day at 00 : 00_hours .
F	unable to review as have not received the order .
M	an excellent and easy to use website enables ease of ordering .
M	toilet cupboard bottom all smashed in .
F	when i tried to exchange them i was a few_days over their 00 day policy .
M	the packing instructions you receive with the envelope say that basic insurance ( up to £_00 ) is included in the service and that you should consider paying extra to get more insurance but when i went to the post_office they confirmed that the pre_- pay category included no insurance and you have to pay extra if you want any .

F	i am due to go on holiday in july and thought this would be great for some cheap and cheerful clothes , how wrong was i ?
F	the next week i ran again and spoke to a woman called jackie .
M	bought a cd_player on their website , but the cd_player sent was different to the one described on their website , it was a lesser model .
F	a woman said she did so the [_external_reference_] driver said could she take it because he didn_'_t have time .
F	the only way i have even felt human most days is to eat a lot of fruit and veg .
M	if you really want this product go to holland + barrett non the high_street .
F	service from local provider was or as no contact on day of fitting and i has to chase leaving voice mails etc several_times .
M	!
F	also i sent numerous_emails had none back at first but the 0th week they did reply each time i emailed them .
M	i could rant on forever , i havent even started on the comfort , flying experience or general quality of service .

M	switch to dpd - i ' d pay extra .
F	as mentioned until order arrives here unable to comment .
F	thank_you .
F	the site is easy to use .
F	she '_s a credit to the company .
F	having not heard of them before , i was a bit_hesitant_about ordering , but went_ahead and did so anyway .
F	would buy from this company again
M	i might also suggest a quick google of what a delivery company is supposed to do , it seems you ' re struggling with this concept a little .
M	good : exterior facilities at villa , apart_from a broken parasol , which urgently needs_replacing .
M	it would have been good to receive an email or two on build progress .
M	in hindsight i guess i should have checked first , but cex could have stated online that the item was boxed or not , or better still use actual images of the figures rather_than stock images from else where .
F	anyway 0hrs . yes 0hrs before my gig in london - i am based in kent , my tickets finally arrived !
F	when i sold a double disc set , they would not let_me charge any more than a single disc cost .
F	printing on the packaging warns that if the packaging is damaged the unit cannot be returned , but i defy_anyone to remove the huge_amount of packing intact .
M	whilst the price was good , i expect veewee to only sell quality items which this wasn_'_t . the case .
F	i was sent e_- mail '_s and text_message at every_stage of my order from confirmation of order to making the flower_arrangement , leaving the florist and finally to the delivery at the door .
F	i had about 0 or 0 brown mushrooms and no more .
M	better_bathrooms replaced all goods with a limited amount of fuss .
F	i sent an_email to your customer_services regarding an order , that i had placed that afternoon .
M	refused to offer replacement and went on to patronise my wife .
M	poor customer service
M	i parked in short_stay car_park 0 .
F	i received my order in a reasonable time but the extra packs of hoover_bags i had ordered were not there - i received one pack when i had ordered three .
F	overall however , i don_'_t think our ticket was value for money and next time we will just take local transport .
M	i sent my iphone_0s to them with a broken screen .
M	we then found out that four paments had been taken from the bank_account .
M	anyway , we end up getting only 0 . 0mb down the line , the same speed i got on broadband a good 00 year_ago .
M	person said they would get the driver to turn_around and try again .
F	card in door said delivery tomorrow - waited all day until 00 . 00 spoke to ipost who said it was out for delivery - not here by 00 . 00 do called ipost again who said driver had an_emergency and had to go home but then they changed story and said he was on way back to depot .
F	as the owner of a demolition business and salvage yard , and employing our own stone mason , i was a little_apprehensive that the finish and design criteria , wouldn t be to my husbands very high_standards , and his obsesssion with attention to detail can be very unforgiving !
M	we have had a couple of orders from more handles , and have been happy with the products and the speed of delivery .
F	i was very disappointed with mopp .
M	fitting this particular cloakroom , the space was not available to fit a corner_basin so the hunt was on to track down a small work top mounted basin .
M	was truly an experience to order , quick and easy to do and saved me money what more do you want from an internet experience .
M	ok so i browsed a few different websites and came_across a lovely_bunch of flowers on serenata , ordered was happy to pay nearly 00 pounds .
F	the room was over the bar and there was a party until_0pm in the morning with the clearing up noise ceasing by 0pm .
F	it left a bad taste in mouth and it totally_ruined what could '_ve been a sweet experience .
M	we have placed a top priority and agent will call you to numbers provided .
M	chicken casserole - perfect for a winter '_s night after an exhausting day '_s work !
F	great .
M	keeping the prices of some items high so promotions can announce massive_discounts .
F	i searched the net and high_street for a special watch for my partner .
M	i '_m hoping that the other 0 steaks in the pack are more tender to eat .
M	it would appear that these have not been handled with care during delivery and have arrived in a poor state .
F	on holiday at moment but order didn_'_t arrive on time so not seen personalised sashes yet but no use now .
M	i was unlucky .
M	i have sent 0 messages saying i have not received it .
M	tesco assured this would be corrected , but due to shortage of people they could no_longer deliver that day .
M	it '_s been in reading for 0 days .
M	oh and if you are a trade customer such as i , they ( customer_services ) only work until 00 : 00 not later as their colleagues do in the retail side .
F	then we discovered that the courier had just tossed the item over the garden_gate - had clearly made no effort to knock on the door and had not left us any card to say what he '_d done .
M	i '_ve sent more than 00 parcels now and to say my confidence has_been knocked is an_understatement , smokers paradise in luton litterally throw / drop your parcels to the ground i '_m just lucky i have only been sending lite non fragile items .
F	the products i '_ve ordered is good quality and exactly_what i was looking for .
M	i contacted parcel_force and told them not to try and re - deliver the following_day , that i would pick it up from their depot .
M	the guys at interparcel refused to try and help , refused to upgrade telling_me that actually " it is a non - guaranteed service ".
M	most companies have a postage paid facility for returning goods .
M	very happy ," because life isn_'_t always smooth ".
F	i then had go out and buy another costme for a party that was only one day away and spend twice as much money .
M	i wanted to do a course , that was advertised in an email from park_cameras .
F	thankfully i havent had to contact talk - talk many_times for my mam '_s broadband ( she rarely has any_problems ).
M	i understand this review request was made with the awareness or authority of the company to enable them to understand what customers actually experienced from the transaction ( s ).
M	' we believe that only 000_% happy is really happy "?
M	we wanted a ford_galaxy ( 0_seater ) and got a much larger mercedes vito .
F	fri about delivery as i needed to be there to let driver in , i was told , that under no circumstances would the chair be

F	quality is excellent , far better_than others i have seen and the service was superb . i will recommend you to everyone who comments on my lovely new sign
M	impressed with car and general overall service but as expected with most rental_companies nowadays fuel_policy is a rip_off .
M	no_problems - happy to use again
M	gave name , address , etc .
F	i was told the store would be contacted and informed on what had been agreed .
F	we had one local firm from our comparemymove request arrange an_appointment but was disappointed to see that the bigger ( better insured ) firms don_'_t appear to be listed .
M	delivery ahead of time .
M	the fact is yes they are very good / nice / efficient at taking your money and it is cheaper_than other insurance providers , however do not rate until you have actually made a successful claim .
F	cannot_fault this company .
F	iv booked a hotel twice through hotel_direct now , once online and once over the phone .
M	i got to dover for the 0 . 00 p . m . ferry and was told that i had to pay £_000 . 00 extra as i was carrying goods ( not for commercial gain ) and that unless i paid it i could not travel .
F	the fit was not very flattering and i felt that i could have bought the dress much_cheaper with a better quality at a shop like primark !
F	i predominently browse online but prefer to order and pay per telephone from where i find the process easy .
M	delivery is quick and the quality is good , i '_m a repeat_customer .
M	i tried to review the gate fixings on their website to point out they are not sent with instructions , despite them saying they are .
M	rang and told salesman , " thats strange , surprised i never_heard it when i drove it but pop it back and sure we will sort it ".
M	so , i knoew things were about to go wring when i got down to st_albans on the m0 and the traffic was slow as it can get ….
F	should have been better getting them from a market
M	emailed showerdoc and they replied quickly and suggested which part needed_replacing .
M	first time i '_ve_used the site .
F	he helped_us choose what was right for us without being_pushy .
M	had a very nice apology stating was a typo , however no mention of delivery to my other address .
M	so only issues was communication ,
F	to say the least , seems like argos need to update their systems and reconsider their suppliers .
M	citylink lost package , and would not respond to calls or emails until i mentioned the police .
F	absolutely_shocking , disgusting , and probably illegal .
M	the whole_process was somewhat laboured but at_least i saved about £_00 .
M	would certainly recommend this company .
F	these were greeted with dismissal and forwarding to the manufacturer , my response as follows ,
M	the customer service department is unhelpful , inept and incompetent and i would not recommend this company to anyone .
M	if you are ever tempted to use hotelsclick . com - just don_'_t : they are liars and cheats !!
M	eflowers found this no problem and delivered the very next_day .
F	left over a hundred passengers stranded in bologna ( or rather at forli - over an_hour away from bologna - with no access to taxis , buses or hotels available ).
M	ordering went really well , great service and kept me well informed .
M	- go to ikea and save 000_quid !
M	the quality of the work which was carried_out was great , but it took along time to deliver , after having to chase the order a couple of times . would i use them again ?
F	sent phones on thursday and cheque arrived for full_amount on following_tuesday .
F	yodel make you wait in 0am to 0pm for nothing .
F	i cannot_fault the immediacy and efficiency of their responses .
M	i clicked the radio button to not have travel_insurance but the price still included it .
F	book a local firm and save your time and money . thank_you at_least for the refund , but not impressed .
M	huge_range of products . the items i have purchased have always been superb quality , delivery within a couple of days of ordering and communications from kenable such as order tracking also superb .
F	any other company i have dealt_with sees a pop and promptly refunds customer !
M	if this is where villa_plus ' es are , then they are not for us .
F	i had a panorama photograph beautifully framed and the print quality looks excellent too .
M	great !
F	i immediatly contacted yodel and put in query wheres my stuff ??
F	so , i did send the gift , and it was gratefully_received , but it had to go anonymously and without a note .
F	it was easy to order and i was very pleased with the friendly attitude of staff .
M	i find it hard to believe that i '_m not being_lied to as none of what i '_ve been told adds up .
M	spokre with chorley_nissan again on either monday or tuesday ( 00th or 00th ) was there was no trace of the key !!!!!
M	ordered 0 blinds from this company .
F	wanted a new mattress and found john_ryan on the web .
M	will use a different company next time
M	on the phone again , they send another engineer who actually fixes the laptop .
M	stay_away unless you get confirmation on the phone that they have items available for immediate delivery .
M	edit_: still on hold 00mins
F	from the calls i made to follow_up , i gather that the delivery van had broken down , but no - one thought to keep me informed .
M	i have found webtogs to offer an excellent service , however i find the shipping rates to ireland are prohibitively high - for example £_00 . 00 postage for a pair of socks !!!
F	i placed an order with golfgarb for the first time .
M	( b )( they did not enclose a return_label
M	buy cheap buy twice or buy at a good price and get good quality .
F	however , we did receive a smashed tank ( assume courier damaged it ), they sorted it out very quickly and replaced the item within days .
F	i doubt you will get through .
F	emails are never replied to either , so if they don_'_t reply to them why have it as an option to contact the company in the first place .
M	the staff are very friendly & helpful .
F	could not ask for more .
F	the larger bags have been fine so far but the 0kg_bags have all broken and have had to be decanted into other containers .
M	i called my bank who informed me there is some unsafe activity on the credit_card so it had to be cancelled .
F	thanks
F	i requested call_backs to explain where we were at , but 0 out of 00 times that never happened .
F	not bad because i have not got any email
F	although the box was delivered on time , this did give me some cause for concern .
M	if i had been flying something with a yoke , it probably would have worked very well on my right knee - so i '_m not anti the product , just make_sure you will have room to use it .
F	fits on bugaboo perfectly and looks warm and cosy .
F	platform is well_designed and easy to use , but i finding it frustrating if you get stuck , then customer service is not the greatest , especially using support email .
M	superb !
F	who signed for it ??
M	second purchase from this company .
M	awaiting responce as too why incorrect part sent , as i have ordered original fast flow electronic fuel sensor with wiring and reserve indicator for speedo , i hope correct_part comes this time , plus i require a diagram of installation as nothing with part number :_0000000 had none ,
M	they tell_lies and say that the promoter has not released them .

M	the glasses were qwuite easy to order , came quickly and were cheap .
M	we received prompt contact from the company ( as a result of this review ) asking what the problems were and if there was anything they could do to put them right , which i was impressed with .

M	don_'_t bother with others , you ' re just wasting time .
M	overall chaos_cards is a great company , however they are starting to fall behind their competition such as card team , koolkingdom , da card world and troll and toad to name a few .
M	unbelievable value , well_packaged and prompt delivery .
M	it was easy and enjoyable .
F	firstly there is no secure_location as the building is locked and a colleague of hers went back to look and there were no flowers !
M	however we had our car broken into resulting in a side window being broken and damage to the windscreen .
M	as i have a paypal_account this was my choice .
M	for the outlay of £_00 , i consider this to be well below standard , and i will_definitely think_twice before using moonpig again !
M	i buy the flavourart virginia flavour and it is the best tobacco_flavour by a country_mile .
F	thank_you , i will use your service again .
F	i ordered late on the 0th and it has yet to ship , of course payment was taken straight_away .
F	they emailed me again and said the brown was discontinued but if i '_d like to choose a completely new £_00 model they would give me a cheap pair of glasses free on top of that .
M	i purchased a bed and bedding and had them delivered the next_day .
M	reading feedback on the web it would seem admin_charges ( not declared upfront ) are probably the reason .
M	tempted to send everything back for being such a pain ….
F	the 000 g duc d ' o belgian luxury chocolates which were paid for as an extra were actually out of date when they arrived .
M	great value for money .
M	purchased a tablet online last night , was informed i will get a confirmation_email .
M	in the end they came in a plastic_bag in a cardboard_box & the end of the cardbox box had broken open .
F	i '_ll never use royal_mail again !
F	would fully recommend the whiskey_exchange .
F	it is immoral for these ticket companies to make so much profit on tickets and what was the £_00 . 00 booking_fee for when we booked on - line and did not even speak to anyone !
M	no_indication that goods weren_'_t in stock .
M	pixmania refused a request from paypal for the refund , and one week_later i phoned pixmania to ask where my money was , they told me that i had to drop my paypal_dispute before they would give me my money back , in other words they are trying to blackmail me into dropping the insurance and protection of paypal - thus leaving me wide open to them denying all knowledge of any payment and me being over £_000 out of pocket .
M	i gave him my address ( again ) to confirm and was told that the bill would be at my address within 0 days .
F	it would have been helpful if the despatch of the order could have been notified by email , as it was not possible to arrange to be at home for the package to be received , or to organise installation .
M	the customer experience is everything and as businesses like comet and countless others discovered deliver this or go out of business .
F	i contacted urban_industries to advise of the situation who i must_say we ' re very helpful and prompt with replies and they advised that they would investigate with the delivery company .
M	i ordered a antec 000 case on the wednesday_night !
M	monster gave_us this .
F	not what was promised by iflorist !
M	email today offering me a different bracket - they must have seen my original review .
M	you have to cancel otherwise they will renew the subscription automatically .
M	very fast payment .
F	you get what you pay for .
F	i have had nothing but trouble from parcels being delivered to the wrong_address , putting a calling_card through letter_box without ringing the bell ( on more than one occassion ) when i am in , to arranging a second delivery and they don_'_t turn_up .
F	my other 00 bulbs are still working so it was my opinion that this bulb was faulty in some way , but still not interested .
F	do not trust anything these people say to you on the phone .
M	the actual product and delivery were good and on time but i had problems placing my order .
M	the website was very straightforward , and easy to navigate .
M	phoned them up and explained we were desperate as we export goods and need to know the weights , they obliged and delivered as soon as they could .
M	i ordered my latest pc using the fast - track service at midnight and it was out the door for shipping the next_day before 0pm .
F	took me about three hours in total to get this far .
M	although i ordered a small part costing around 0 quid it was treated with a personal caring touch , a simply refreshing_change !
M	deliveries are usually quick , however i don_'_t pay much attention to the delivery estimates , as orders can arrive either much_quicker_than_expected , or take longer_than estimated .
M	the heel wedges which i ordered arrived the next_day - incredible service .
F	have to the other aa , .
F	the villa was clean but very basic in what it had to offer .
M	very fast service .
F	so will most certainly use them again .
F	in stock items didn_'_t arrive so i phoned to chase_up the order .
F	t . callison @ sky . com
F	however the courier delivery service leaves a bit to be desired .
M	i paid for 0 - 0 day guaranteed delivery .
M	the goods were only dispatched on the monday . told them that there would be no one available to receive the goods other than a fixed time_slot on wednesday .
F	i explained hat this was only because the sales_rep had urged me several_times to get do this as quickly as possible after receipt .
F	no_hassle dropping your car off or picking it up , very quick n easy .
M	!
M	never bought tyres on line before , really great service , would definitely recommend this service .
M	i have yet to find a supplement company that even comes_close to the selection offered by supplementwarehouse . com .
M	an immediate bank_transfer was made
F	i received a prompt and courteous response , but also pointing it out that the answer was on the web_site .
F	nb when the web_site says ' free next_day delivery ', it actually means it will leave there warehouse the same or next_day .
F	item has not yet been delivered because delivery driver ' could not find property '.
F	as i said their service is very good .
M	from placing the order , reviewing the artwork to the actual delivery was very professional .
F	great service from ao online .
F	then , the delivery guy_who came to the door complained he had a bad back and couldn_'_t carry the bed up the stairs .
F	the conversation got around to the perfumes we wore then and what certain
M	despite these administration disappointments , the service from the office staff was excellent .
M	no_problems , easy to use and everything_went_according to plan .
F	0_months later we are still pending the refund but otherwise things seem to be sorted as we re - booked new flights through another company
M	great business model they have !
F	good service but not top quality , i was expecting like it details on the advert that the delivery man would take the shopping into the kitchen , but he just left it at my front_door , and it wasnt all bagged either .
F	it '_s all very dispiriting !
F	fast delivery and kept_updated with emails at every_stage .
M	i missed the one about receiving an sms_message and was charged £ 0 . 00p for something i don_'_t want .
F	i would not recommend this particular car_park and drop_off to anyone .
F	this was excellent service .
F	i did recieve an_email but not confirming my flights it was to say my flights had gone up in price so they would need to cancel .
F	the only_reason they get away with this & are not on watchdog every week (!)
F	i was was initially pleased to find this site offering the items i was looking for at prices below the high_street and with free delivery .
M	the advice you receive has to be consistent , professional and accurate .
M	i got a rather curt reply from them saying i should have followed the instructions more carefully .
F	didnt have time to send back , so just used it with problems .
F	i would not_hesitate to use this site again and would recommend it to others
F	thank_you very much .
F	by post .
F	they first uplifted my parcel in november - failed to deliver but claimed they put a card through my door - they did not , i have a metal mail box , nothing gets lost .
F	easy , quick and such a quick delivery .
M	my 0000 sub is great but i feel that watchfinder have squeezed an extra £_000 from myself and that has left me with a slight bad_taste !!
M	although we got there in the end , it was frustrating and complicated trying to book shipments in the australia and nz .
M	you are better of researching the subject yourself .
F	for some unknown_reason ubs were unable to deliver at my workplace .
M	first its down , oddbins is apparently bankrupt , then its up , whittalls wine merchants buy half the stores and save thousands of job .
F	they were left at the door in the rain and wind for 0 hours before they were found .
F	i would use again as an excellent service - next_day delivery - but postage and packing at £ 0 . 00 for 0 to 0 uk delivery days , i found particularly expensive
F	once again my order was despatched very quickly .
M	perhaps i '_m not working hard enough !
F	the service i received was very quick , and when i had the call to welcome me the lady_who i spoke to was very pleasant and very helpful really great service provided , made sure that if i had any unaswered questions that they were answered .
M	it looked horrific but smelt ok so i put it under the grill as i thought our microwave was on the way out .
F	felt text had a glittery effect to it that u couldn_'_t make out on website perhaps it should state this somewhere , as on first_glance looks like printer was running out of ink . fairly good value for money .
M	but a lot of their deals ( on physical items especially ) are just over - hyped .
F	my only problem was that i could only find one set of frames that i really , really liked , out of the ones i had tried , so had to make a snap decision about what my second_pair would be .
M	i ordered this globe 0 - 0_weeks before fathers_day , as it looked like a really good present that my dad would like .
M	good company .
F	great sales !
M	they started telling_me that i needed to photocopy bank_statements to prove it .
F	none .
M	from then on it was a familiar story of poor communication , endless chasing , never returning calls , but was no worse than i expected .
M	after a number of phone_calls more , and me threatening them with the involvement of trading_standards they eventually gave in and gave_me my originally_quoted figure .
M	any negative 0_star reviews on this company are always reported and subsequently removed whilst the amazing but obvious false pr driven 0_star reviews are still there .
M	i booked a hire car for one day .
M	overall the service was reasonable , we bought a substancial amount of furniture , however had i known that i had to unpack this i don_'_t think i would have bought it .
M	this happened to me again today with item showing offer of £ 0 and when i got to the till , it was £ 0 . 00 !
M	a few_months later the same issue_arose and again it is taking several days to resolve .
F	easy to place my order with great follow - up emails .
M	i can not fault the service that you give to actual customers but i do not agree that you only will give discount to a customer that shops on your online store but not to a customer that shops on your e / bay site to which i got my first item from .
F	i spoke to a friendly , efficient and coherent young_man who gave_me clear_instructions and advice , with my email in front of him .
F	i will never order from this company ever again and will tell everyone else not to either .
F	i was informed when it was on its way and when it was delivered .
F	i bet most of the positive_reviews on here are people they pay . but this is my opinion .
F	why offer this service if you cannot keep to it ?
F	these drawers cost around 000_pounds .
F	and will pursue this to the end .
F	they took on too many orders and cannot now deliver .
M	i thought her response was not acceptable and insisted that i spoke to the manager .
M	really poor service with blantent lying .
M	i will have to pay the price the person would pay who just happened to walk in possibly an illegal immigrant with no checkable personal history or credit_rating or anything people could call background .
F	when they have bothered to respond it '_s ' i '_ve raised a refund request for you ' which never materialises .
F	i was expecting rather vivid_colours not pastel looking something .
F	whats the whole point in building up your experience something and then get a refund . unacceptable .
M	thank_you .
M	i roughly knew the color clarity and cart i was looking for , but every ring i seen on the high_street was massively over budget .
M	i ordered two radiators and thermostatic valves , which were delivered within a couple of days .
F	it worked_perfectly fine .
F	i was very disappointed with the daffodils i had purchased especially as i had upgraded the bouquet to a larger one .
M	i had to work had to persuade the staff_member to let_me speak to a manager .
M	if you don_'_t pay them , they won_'_t let you respond to give your side of the story , which doesn_'_t sound very fair to me .
F	i was lucky_enough to find this site when i wanted a pair of size0 merrell sandals and they were a good price too .
M	when i had not heard_anything i phoned the centre to be told that they were there , i went and had them fitted which didn_'_t take long .
F	really fast , efficient service from simply baby & free delivery .
M	because i had done so on the same day , ferrsavers waved their change fee but the ferry company still wanted to keep theirs as i hadn_'_t booked direct .
M	the inter_parcel labels were stuck and pasted over our original address .
F	i didn_'_t expect the roller_blind to look so good , but they do , we are going order more for other windows in our home .
F	very condisending .
F	very quick delivery .
F	better_than others iv visited for the items i needed .
M	delivery speeds are dire and can be well over a week before your item arrives .
F	they arrived between there time_slot as stated and the delivery man opened the box with me to check there was scratches etc
M	the amazing free mobile_phone
F	seriously !?!
F	so all in all , a complete waist of 00_quid :(
F	in future when i want anything for the garden i will go straight to their web_page and put an order in .
F	you '_ve gotta be having a laugh ?!
F	silent , wash well , easy to instal , not a bad look too . so what more could i ask ?
M	this was after various calls to 0000 numbers which has cost me god_knows in phone_calls .
M	as a regular customer , orders placed have been received very quickly , and the prices are significantly better_than my local_vet .
M	that aside though , good posters , good price , arrived in good nick etc , just rather misleading and rather ropey customer service .
F	nice , product , quick delivery .
M	i used currency_solutions to transfer money from my uk bank to my us bank .
F	the other reason i am not giving any higher than 0_stars is because of their customer service .
F	thanks again .
M	although you can buy slightly_cheaper on the web , i prefer top quality products that i can trust with great service at a competitive price . the choc was a nice_touch too !
M	i have been so impressed with tsohost .
M	i chose to have a new pc built , this was shipped within a day once again and then was with me the day , plus i had my fast - track costs refunded back to me .
M	they are good people to do a bit of business with .
M	i have been using myprotein for easily around 0 years , and have never had a problem , their customer service is normally excellent .
F	super speedy delivery and good quality products at very competitive_prices :) thank_you !
M	he went out of his way to accomodate me and ensure i was fully up to speed with all the processes and stages .
F	drop_off otherwise was ok with very pleasant contact at airport car_park .
F	to be fair the customer service lady was trying to be helpful bu also had her hands tied .
M	needed the jacket ligthening fast so one of you guys pushed it to the front of the mail queue and i received on friday in time for my bothers party on saturday .
F	i would never had thought about buying a battery online but was recommended by a friend and i found the whole_thing amazingly easy , quick and totally successful - even a mini_bar of chocolate as well .
M	we tried to stop it but were out of time , and the payment was finalized and so irreversible .
F	buy loads of stuff from ebuyer - always had a great service from them , with absolutely no_complaints whatsoever - highly_recommended online trader
M	xmas morning when i opened the game it wasnt actually the retail version it was the version included in the box with the ps0 that cex had clearly taken out ( or it may have even been a trade in ) and sold to my unsuspecting mum who didnt know any better , it wasnt even sealed and the disk had finger_prints on it but yet they still charged her the full retail price of £_00 for a used game .
F	it is now 00 days_later and the wedding_invites have still not arrived .
F	i love the idea and the ease and simplicity and the food was delievered quickly and it makes_sense , however wont continue as didnt find the soups or meals tasty and so demotivating .
M	i purchased a 00 * 0 self assemble polycarbonate greenhouse in february_0000 .
F	!
F	in 0 years i have never come_across this and the company i ordered from many_times before has lost my custom while they continue to use this company to deliver their stuff
M	!
F	no one answered .
F	i posted my phone on saturday and i received payment on the monday , very easy to understand and i would definitely use again .
M	it '_s more_expensive but at_least i wont encounter the problems mentioned and will actually recieve what i have paid for .
M	best prices given and a really quick_turnaround
F	if this is what is happening before we '_ve even taken off , what can we expect from the holiday ?
M	a very efficient service with next_day delivery .
F	the website was easy to use , with lots of layout options , and for a really good price in comparison to others .
M	other than this ( major ) complaint , i was reasonably pleased .
M	after calling them directly 0 times to complain_about paying for my shirt with paypal to send to germany they did .
F	fantastic pans do exactly_what they say , i would buy other products from procook .
M	it '_s important to send itemised receipts with deliveries --- cos your online confirmations don_'_t always agree with the quoted prices / offers stated at point of purchase .
F	comparing travel_insurance , some companies were more_expensive on single trips than the quote given from essential_travel for the annual_multi_trip .
M	a very positive purchase .
M	good travel_insurance except it would be better if the online quote gave you the admin_fee as well , apart_from that great .
M	kept up to date on delivery schedule .
F	i finally received email from complete_care - a one line apology for the delay .
M	a reasonable person would recommend mr fernandes seeks legal opinion should he decide to enable any defamatory comments not to be fully retracted and an_apology issued .
F	hey refused to give me a refund and said i must have long arms !.
F	products arrived on time and received email to say on their way which is useful .
M	lg call and sorted the problem in 00_hours .
M	it looks great , was great value and delivered to promise .
M	no " losing " my funds for a week to generate interest on my transfer , exchange_rates which cannot be_beaten , instant communication , what more do i need ?
M	of course and this time it will be our first choice .
M	this companys policy on refunds is ridiculous .
M	interesting that i then received an email_saying it had been delivered at 00 . 00 - yeah_right !
F	the picture is not clear at all but because it was a deal , i just kept it .
F	would recommend .
F	easy to use website , great product range and competitively_priced .
F	the trophies arrived on time - very quick_turnaround .
F	just like to say how extremely , efficient and courteous our fitter steve maybury was .
F	after_searching for months for a decent tv table / stand / cabinet , i stumbled_across justtvstands in internet by coincidence .
F	it was obvious to us that someone had been driving the car in our absence .
F	excellent service and will be even easier next time now details are logged in .
F	companies such as this should not be allowed to operate .
F	received two home_trials with speedy delivery also had a query which was quickly and helpfully answered by staff .
F	once you have been done there are no signs to the terminal_building so you end up going through what looks like an office block to find the terminal - all in all - long_winded , stressful and you are left late !
F	literally came the next_day once !
M	!
F	the delivery was equally as quick and i was very impressed with the service .
F	i rang off and booked the flight elsewhere .
F	approved promptly and were a good price !
F	small plastic part was 0th of price of whole fridge .
M	why should i order through this website and pay the charge if i then have to call direct anyway .
M	the item finally turned_up around two_weeks_later than_expected .
F	i placed my order with this company for a number of items all of which arrived within a week - fine so far .
F	i missed a few the first time and ended_up with two batches to submit .
M	terrible .
M	excellent .
F	i ordered ankle_supports after being recommend to buy from this site .
M	a little_slow on delivery but got item in the end and very pleased however knowledge of the product wasn_'_t to good at customer service as i was told when ordering it takes gu00_bulbs and came with product .
F	i made an enquiry about sizing of an all in one , not a purchase and you have not got back to me so assuming you are not a legitimate web_site
M	i then got transfered both_times and cut_off .
F	my issue & hence the 0stars rating is to do with the product ordered .
M	it tells you on the website that postage on orders over £_00 is free .
F	we noted that in section six of the user agreement the advertiser makes clear that they charge a fee for their part if setting_up the service and that if a job is cancelled the fee is returned as credit which must be used within six_months .
M	good old bt hadn_'_t effected the credit .
F	the web_site is simple to use .
M	i was appauld .
M	what a great find on the internet , brilliant range of work_tops to choose from .
M	i can get a box sent from the uk with a £ 0 . 00 delivery cost and receive it in 0 days .
F	we followed the procedure of confirming our pickup times etc .
M	i bought these biblongs online , normally i would buy on .
F	only part of my order has_been delivered , still_waiting for rest of it .
M	but not so great on shipping time .
F	i would recommend uk electrical supplies .
F	wrong choice of word , more like extreme disappointment .
F	and then . it would be another 0 – 0 working_days .
F	0 .
F	with the voucher from google the price was good .
F	the transaction was very smooth .
M	i have been a big tesco consumer but recent experience with there credit_card has changed my mind , i was forced to have a low limit ( 0 . 0 x less then i was offered with my bank ) but because of double club card points i took out the card .
M	the ' premier gate fixings ' does not fit the ' contractor featheredge gate '.
F	i ordered a small item from this company to give them a trial before ordering a bathroom_suite .
M	thankfully at moment i am happy with things at the moment and as long as that continues i wont need to endure speaking to representatives with little or no command of english !
M	purchase was easy and staff were very helpful with solving issues .
M	had ordered another item from a different supplier which arrived in three_days to edinburgh .
F	website is very easy to use and fantastic that you can pay on an invoice and don_'_t require card payment !
F	the financial_advisor was only just contacting us last_week about seeing her illustrations , so we would be at_least a month behind and a dip in the stock market if we had followed this route .
M	simple to use website , clear_descriptions prices etc .
M	we had to cancel our appointment with them and , to this date , have not had a refund .
F	also , they attempt to make out that it '_s the fault of the consumer , particularly galling with me , as a highly qualified oxford graduate .
M	this appears to be a ploy to attact customers .
M	citylink then phoned up to tell us that they had left it with number 00 .
F	naturesbest were exceedingly helpful to me .
M	would be better if delivered together
F	we can confirm that the order is being_processed and your order will be dispatched asap ."
F	the only_niggle i have was i thought i '_d gone for free_postage and was surprise to find i hadn_'_t .
M	det_er desværre ikke første gang , at jeg_har haft problemer_med telenor .
M	never use envirofone again .
M	ordered a garden storage_unit it arrived late and damaged .
F	i ordered them with plenty of time ahead .
F	booked it online on a protected site which had a good rating .
M	there was a delay in the tyres reaching the depot but i was advised well before my booked slot and in fact they were fitted only one hour later .
F	what about something in between .
M	the order tracking on the site was useless .
M	most of the social_media interfaces have changed since the course was designed and several of the features have ceased completely ( eg there are chunky sections on linkedin answers and linkedin events both of which are no_longer supported ).
F	when i chased i was told there was a problem with the delivery - i '_d chosen beech wood and they only had pine ( or something_similar ).
F	i feel despite the best efforts of customer_services i am unable to rate them higher than three stars as if things had gone to plan in the first place it would have made my experience so much simpler .
M	awful staff .
M	great example of terms and conditions : " we will process your order and not pass any of your details to nobody , after 0 months we also delete all your details from our systems .
M	delivery was quick and goods as_described .
F	i '_m not sure_whether the 0 week wait time was down to the actual supplier of my oil , or whether it was due to me going via the boilerjuice website , but a 0 week wait for oil is ridiculous .
M	i assumed the address_label which i received was the shipping label .
F	i was just told they would refund me and they were sorry .
F	the tops were exactly as_described .
F	i am awaiting contact about 0 different complaints i have made regarding their poor customer service .
F	i doubt i will be ordering from a animed again , as i could not track my parcel !
F	i am hoping it will get a little colder here so i can wear it !!
F	i felt they weren_'_t interested .
M	i '_m actually really annoyed and don_'_t tend to use the service again .
M	no other courier companies for me as i am so pleased with the service being provided - wonderful !
M	the ( limited ) uk service support is arguably better_than many of the biggest isps and the staff are for the large part friendly and with good intentions .
M	this is my first experience in selling a mobile_phone and has_been quick , easy and worry free .
M	the web_site is easy to use with savings on rrp clearly_shown .
F	whenever i want a new game for my wii or ds systems i will always check shopto and they are always cheaper from anywhere_else .
M	00 days_later and still nothing !
F	kind_regards
F	i was livid when i opened the box and saw how little there was in there , and i bought it at a sale price of just over_£_00 .
F	all in all it took nearly 0_weeks from initial order to receiving my product .
F	easy to use and quick .
M	i noticed , after the shipment was signed for , that the leg of one chair had broken through the box and was slightly_scuffed .
F	subsequently she told me that i would need to reset my password as they were having problems with there web_site ., they would send me and e_- mail to enable me to do this , but this could take anytime from 0 - 00_hrs .
M	the on - line chat takes_forever to get connected to a person ( average 00_mins )!
M	really tasty , order some now
F	i originally ordered one from mamma and pappa who also had a price promise on the stokke_xplory travel set .
F	would definately recommend physio_room to anyone
M	very pleased .
F	the ritual of grinding these black , oily gems is the next step in my coffee experience , and the kitchen is filled with the richness of them , as they grind into a dark powdery promise .
M	advised that cockroaches are endemic on lanzarote but we weren_'_t warned in advance .
M	at first , everything worked_fine and i was able to get payments regularly from them .
F	great sunglasses love them
F	again chased by email , same again .
F	the worktop is perfect and looks even better now oiled .
F	i can not call this a service because it is not .
F	j **** probably wasn_'_t any more in charge than the girl he initially spoke to .
F	one of the bags were opened .
M	its is medium - firm and very comfortable .
F	however , when i received my statement i have been charged in full .
F	however , the argos reservation system is a real nightmare , sometimes it shows an item as not available , then if you try again , it is available .
F	i have seen better flowers being discarded not delivered as a funeral tribute .
F	i am going to ask for my money back , plus compensation for phone_calls & wasted time .
F	i feel very let_down by the online service whats the point of having the pre ordering service if they don_'_t follow it through
F	very friendly service , delivery was super_fast !
M	i agreed to get an iphone 0 , but was told unequivocally that i had 00 days to return it to any cpw shop if i changed my mind .
M	i have just been depositing money so i dont see the point on going on iam just losing money so i am not playing anymore .
M	!
F	if an item gets damaged at their depot , they will not return it , nore with the provide you with any evidence of damages , they will just destroy it , and all you will have from them as proof that it was damaged is ' because we said so '.
F	couldn_'_t be better .
F	i ordered some flowers for my daughter for her_birthday and received email_confirmation of safe delivery .
F	this was about my 0th order , all others were good , sadly this order was badly packaged and 0 shampoo bottles were damaged - the tops had come off .
F	did not arrive on the expected day .
M	there was no crash !!!!!!!!!
M	if the size of the range_rover had been taken into account on the first visit and i had been asked to take it into the centre at that time i would have considered the service to be very good , as it was i was left_feeling frustrated .
M	i left in march and have not looked back .
F	first one email promising a delivery slot for friday midday , so stayed in . then second email promising late_afternoon delivery .
F	det første svar var meget venligt , men ind til videre har det_ikke gjort nogen forskel .
F	i was sent exactly the same logo sample again and that was the start of over 00 emails being exchanged with either the same design or the same responses :
F	on saturday_morning i received another text_message to say my delivery would be approx 00_minutes .
F	sorry , i hate to say it but i can '_t imagine anyone could like this rehydrated stodge .
F	it took considerable time for him to eventually agree to refund .
F	the closeup chair photos on the back in action website do show these holes and it isn_'_t obvious that they aren_'_t required to fit the new babyset , however seeing that the babyset had changed i should have double_checked .
M	so , the next_day i tracked my order to see that it had changed to ' item on back order ' - it wasn_'_t even in stock !!!
M	they arrived almost before i ' d completed the order .
F	beware of the rental_desk staff we paid way too much for fully inclusive .
M	and was a far better deal than what e0 were offering ( iphone_0s )
F	.
F	after long conversations over phone , they sent me an_email with some details of procedures i had to follow ( duty tax ).
F	the delivery was also very quick and service excellent .
F	the transporter guy told me he didn_'_t have the full address on his scanner so he couldn_'_t find me .
M	if you don_'_t know how annoying it is to be told the same thing numerous_times a day without resolution , sign up to orange and find out there are 0 companies i would never ever join if i had the choice ( my phone and contract is company supplied ).
F	i feel robbed !!
M	to try and get hold of someone on the phone at this company is near_impossible !!!
F	they offered to enclose an_apology with the delivery and offered me a £ 0 credit towards a future order as compensation .
M	the fitting was speedy , and on time .
M	would be my first_port of call next time i require anything that they provide .
F	apparently the firms making these has done so for 00 years .
F	now have to return item as arrived too late .
M	so i said i will think about it and walked_away .
F	the bag arrived very quickly . unfortunately when using it for the first time in natural daylight have noticed some discolouring in the canvas .
M	was disappointed with the help i got after part of order was damaged / undelivered and the service of the phone helpline as took a ridiculous_amount of time to get through to them .
F	the web advertises the unit , but when you go to options the tabour toilet is at a additional_cost .
F	fine .
M	thank_you very much .!
F	this is a disgrace .
F	ordered a childrens rug online as this was perfect for the playroom we were furnishing and at a great price - our rug turned_up on time and was exactly as pictured on - line .
F	since there was no sign of delivery after three_days , i emailed them and they , only then , advised that what i requested was not on stock .
M	i decided to try gumtree as the costs ( as a seller ) for using e_- bay have escalated to a very high_level .
F	it was great watching her using the brushes and showing us how to .
M	would recommend the company to anyone who_wants to make the sale of their mobile as easy and smooth as it can get .
M	after about a month the package was finally delivered and uk flooring direct said that the state of the packaging was so bad that the packs were in pieces .
F	customer service very good and helpful , however id think about chaning your courier service
F	the delivery is always quick and it is good value for money .
F	i recently bought travel_insurance with this company and found them to be quick and easy to get a quote without_any hassle plus very competitive
M	i actually called animed on what turned_out to be the day of dispatch to check my order had been approved , and was very pleased with the customer service i received .
F	it is in full working order but i was a bit surprised that in addition to the unlocking , it seemed to have wiped many of the phones settings / features etc during some reformatting - so in fact there were no_longer any nokia themes , wallpapers , tones etc left on the phone .
F	the check - in at both_ends was painless .
M	i bought from the website and when i received the wii and what was supposed to be 0 games , instead i got a wii that was damaged on the back which was not in the description and i only received one game and not too , so not very pleased since this is ment for someone_else as a christmas_present : s
M	the order was confirmed and a delivery timeframe established .
F	replacements arrived following_tuesday .
F	however after choosing ryanair as there flights where so cheap , it didn_'_t turn out that way .
M	well top be fair [_name removed_], i did have to send trustpilot full evidence via all of the nasty emails and bribes as evidence before they would even host the review , and as you recall , it was you who blackmailed me to remove my original review otherwise you ' d still be withholding my refund now , in contradiction of the uk '_s distance_selling_regulations !
M	if i ' d have walked_into a florist and asked them to build me a bouquet for the same money i spent , i ' d have got a much_better result .
M	i have no_hesitation in recommending currency_uk to anyone who regularly needs to transfer money abroard at the best exchange_rates .
F	i ordered a big_boy beanbag in wk 00 and was told wk 00 .
M	tesco is crap !
M	disappointed and it has left me misled on pricing .
M	arrival date spot on .
F	i was refunded just about immediately i returned it .
M	it would have been very helpful if the furniture_market had told us this in advance .
F	* have pictures of all of the colours of the boxes .
F	- exactly as it said on the tin .
M	the order was accepted and i was sent an email confirmation .
F	our order was dealt_with quickly and sent out within they time they promised .
F	i had no idea that homebase and argos were the same company .
F	i ring again .
M	excellent service .
F	i am contacting watchdog and trading_standards .
M	recently have purchased 0 pairs of glasses , first pair - frames not available - very little feedback , except when i sent emails .
M	vodaphone are bunch of thieves that can not be trusted their broadband coverage and customer_services are rubbish .
M	called in to the shop , was meet by a friendly staff_member .
F	my flowers didn_'_t leave the deport till after ten am
F	fast dispatch , item exactly as_described , great price !!!
M	shopped_here online for years and every times its been spot on order comes in a few day a big 0_stars
M	rx were the best priced .
M	by far the best flower delivery service i have every used .
M	dispatch in a very good timely maner and a very good communication on the customer service level .
F	i was able to save on both items .
F	it was all very straight_forward and dean_ratcliffe at key was so helpful .
M	we have had far less problems dealing on line than we had dealing_with one of the major high_street_opticians .
F	i do not think it '_s one thing to forget .
M	they only have occasional good deals now . such a shame !
F	i ordered a half drive socket set for my other_halfs birthday .
M	discounted prices for the same items !
F	whatever way , inconsistency in providing information to a customer can make a wonder !
M	!
M	therefore , i had to contact them to find out if it had gone though or not ant destroyed my confidence in their booking system .
M	both did respond and a refund and collection for the damaged goods was arranged within_00hrs .
M	the picture on screen has new written on the top left hand_corner of the box .
M	an executable file that cannot be removed = virus .
M	i feel sorry for all you people who have been let_down but it seems to me the faults lie elsewhere . i shall carry on get my gear from gear 0 music .
M	the money was in my account within a day or so .
M	we did not want to be paying for support that the manufacturer was providing in the first year although we had thought about extended_warranty .
F	i emailled the company regarding being charged for postage and they basically said " tough it was my fault for not looking around the site for the free delivery option "
F	usually 000_% reliable , but not this time !
M	i am extremely happy with the regular calls i received from the complaints team to ensure the transfer of supply would proceed without_any other problems .
M	this is my update .
M	easy order .
F	the order time was quite long well over 0_weeks , blind quality looks average .
F	if you prefer , you can use our contact form .
F	once sunglasses promised to be delivered the next_day , they did arrive .
F	.
F	the wine and jam are great value .
M	the websire is now down for 0 days ?
F	have had to make alternative_arrangements now and has turned_out cheaper and better .
M	however it took a week from them confirming_receipt of my phone to the money being sent for payment .
M	flowers were nice with a good amount .
F	would use again and recommend !
M	staff were extremely rude , unhelpful and lied throughout the entire_process .
M	i complained and got a letter to say they will see what they can do and would hear within 00 days .
F	although the website is a little hard to navigate and the pictures are not the best quality the clothing and items are very nice when received .
F	didn_'_t get any call back so called them again , same promise and till now no call back . its been 00_hours now after the second phone_call .
F	i got a few frantic calls because they had read the 0th_may as the 0th_march and thought i wanted to come in the day i had booked on the day
M	so waited for avon delivery , called again - still none delivered .
M	i was able to search for parts specific to my motorcycle make and model , so i got exactly the correct parts for my bike .
F	a shame reall because the rest of the service and delivery was good
M	i purchased the flowers to surprise someone for their birthday i hold very close to me .
F	i have bought from vio_vet now on many occasions , perfect every time , excellent value and service cannot_fault them . thank_you and would always recommend to others with confidence .
M	the current delivery status suggests that they might be delivered today , but obviously a valentine '_s bouquet which arrives on the 00th of feb is about as much use as a chocolate_teapot .
M	called them immediately on monday_morning and after the usual waiting for 00_minutes in a queue to be answered got someone to send out the correct brackets .
F	the flowers i sent were nice but they were not the freshest of flowers they looks a little old and used .
F	my order was processed very quickly , and i was e_mailed a preview before they went_ahead with the engraving .
M	very happy with the product not so much with the delivery service , it clearly says orders delivered after four working_days been waiting five days now and still not been dispatched .
M	utterly complacent and behind the times company living off previous brandname and reputation which is now wholly unjustified .
M	availability of products does not agree with the information provided on site .
F	on arriving in ibiza at 0am we were keen to get to our hotel .
M	they never phone when they say they will , scare you about unretrievable data , take your money when infact very little has_been done and never return the hardware sent .
M	i ordered an artic super_dry windcheater in size large it didn_'_t fit , i sent it back ordering an extra large size which came within days of sending the original one back , this one too was too small , sent it back by free collect service , and ordered an extra extra large which again was sent within day '_s of sending the other one back , very very good service , but must_say the item is a very slim_fit so order two sizes larger than you normally would .
M	i have used the ' live_chat ' function to ask about the gate fixings , just to see if anyone would have any idea about what they sell .
F	i could not praise the service i received more , since groves_nurseries took the trouble to ring me and explain problems about my order and sort them out quickly .
M	so it has taken me 0_weeks to get a whole shed , some of it is still damaged but i repaired it myself rather_than attempt to get anything_else delivered , i had to unload it myself , the original man on customers services was lethargic and uncaring at best - rude at times , and the final product is of a poor quality .
F	quick excellent service .
M	they dont keep you informed of how much of your money is actually being paid to your creditors .
F	great service .
F	i will not be using them again which is a shame as they keep you update and tell you when the flowers have been delivered
F	i thoroughly_recommend the company .
M	still_haven_'_t received my item an_absolute_joke it '_s been a week nothing had been done about it at all very very very unhappy , i ' d of been happy if someone rang me but no just emails absolute loads of crap
M	they were delivered within the time promised and in good condition , despite one package being knocked about a bit in transit .
F	absolutely useless .
F	he was devastated !
F	i ordered them to be there before my arrival at their house .
M	sax concluded that “ the tourists think that they found something to complain and a probability to get refunded .”
F	the web_site is good to find what you are looking for .
M	however i was told that '' unfortunately we are unable to amend the booking as requested as there are o vehicles available from saint malo ferry_port .''
M	i was sent a different piece of equipment that i reluctantly_agreed to , at a slightly reduced price - which turned_out to be faulty !!!!
M	do not , do not under any circumstances order a phone from carphone_warehouse on line or by telephone .
M	redelivered for another day again wasn_'_t in so went through process again so very bad .
M	this should of course be automated .
F	it is clear - as with most growing companies - that they want you to avoid contacting the customer service team , but when you do they respond well within the allotted_time given at the stage of submission , but more often than not with a standard response .
F	never use them again and do not recommend them at all .
M	needed a quote for a replacement bike for the insurance company after having two of my road_bikes nicked from the garage .
F	very - decent , but dress is pretty short , deceptively so compared to the photos , however i needed a new work dress asap and didn_'_t have time to shop so this was quickest .
M	i was a regular argus user (> 000 times in last ten_years ).
F	whilst they arrived in good time ( yesterday 0th_jan_0000 ) the flowers looked very old and tatty and will never be anything like the flowers portrayed on the website .
F	the item was delivered really quickly and the case and engraving were high_quality , i am sure he is going to love it .
F	i would definitely use them again and recommend to others .
M	a couple of welcome progress emails_letting_me know all was in order and no issues with quality or damage on arrival .
F	on the day the flowers were delivered i was out and my husband accepted them , if i had been in i would have asked for a refund and declined the delivery .
F	even comming few_days earlier as i was told .
F	i therefore added a few extras to my planned order .
M	i was in shock as what data_protection they were talking if my data was passed to phone provider by dialaphone now they can not get the reason of rejection back ?
M	the price was extrememly competitive and it was showing as in stock , however a couple of days after ordering it i received an email_saying that it was out of stock and they were waiting for their suppliers to provide it .
M	what can i say , fast delivery and a good price - just what i wanted !
F	i wanted to sell my car but after putting all the datails in they asked me to verify my account .
F	he went on the tell me quite patronizingly that wifi is through your handset and not your sim .
M	recently_bought a corsair 00gb_usb stealth flash_drive .
F	then to cap it off , i went into a shop , which sold unusual_gifts .
F	said there was nothing they could do so asked to speak to a manager .
M	alas , on thursday0th , i receive an email_telling_me 0 items are due for delivery the next_day . well , here i am , still_waiting .
M	in the end i contacted amazon , explained the problem and with the help of amazon '_s customer_support staff have arranged for another carrier to pick it up in a few_days time hopefully with more luck this time .
F	it is fine if you are not in need of the money quickly , otherwise i advise you send your phones by recorded delivery , even then it takes two to three_days for the money to be in your account .
M	this site allows me to order things with no delivery charge , this makes them a bargain .
F	and there '_s no water_damage to the phone either , loads of bollocks !
F	very impressed with the quick service and i will_definately be using mazuma again .
F	i was happy with the way in which to order and the delivery came quickly .
M	adjustable fit so can even out the patio slabs . considering i was going to buy the full set , the table at £_000 was great and buy the chairs another time .
M	good service , this company maybe the next chain_reaction .
M	i wonder about their wares .
M	so_far i have bought a number of nomination products . the price / range etc is great , as is the customer service once ordered .
M	however , disappointed with the ' deal '.
M	many_thanks
M	really good to be able to order a range of spanish products and to receive them within 00_hrs .
F	ridiculous .
M	this confusion with no or nearly no instructions took me 0 hours to fit the towbar , and about another 0 hours to get the lights working and put all the panels back .
M	i accept that mistakes are made sometimes , but certainly didn_'_t expect the attitude i received or the lack of customer_care from a local company which , ultimately led to me taking my business elsewhere and finding a better deal .
M	the option to email key people after each update is good .
M	i would not_hesitate to use these_guys , easy ordering , i even requested economy delivery for nine days and it still arrived in 0 !!
F	the one with attitude ) only started apologising once i told him i want to make a complaint about him .
M	i was told that the driver was an agency driver and ' you know what they are like '.
M	got fed_up with them agreed £_000 credit , which still means i paying over the original quote by £_00 plus extra work , 00 days ago .
M	their products keep getting high ratings on reviews but when things go_wrong , they cannot deal with it .
F	the problems lay firmly on the delivery department who promptly phoned me back telling_me that the shed would be delivered on saturday . 0st lie .
M	all were in stock and shipped the next_day ( a friday ) from central_scotland to somerset .
M	a couple of weeks_later re - sent the letter as an attachment to the complaints form on their web - site , but still received no reply .
F	my mum_loved the flowers when she eventually got them at 0 . 00pm .
F	have used this website before - no_problems .
M	we were kept up to date on order and delivery time , and plaque received by speedy overseas delivery .
F	the base had pot marks and a couple of groves .
F	based on my experience i would recommend that seatwave are a safe and reliable_source of tickets .
F	thx
M	i would recommend both this company and the lacquer furniture it sells .
F	i won_'_t buy from a company that doesn_'_t listen to it '_s customers , it '_s really not hard and is unacceptable from a company their size .
F	but i actually didn_'_t get my order until tuesday !
M	in terms of pricing , we found icuk to be slightly more_expensive than other similarly sized isps due to their tiered bandwidth pricing .
F	my husband booked this ticket for me , using his card , after two_days i got a mail from you saying my booking is cancelled due to payment problem , while we checked his account we find out that money is already taken by ebrookers .
M	the only problem was with the post ordering service .
F	anyway , you do not get re -_imbursed for the return cost , so basically , i have lost £ 0 and got nothing to show for it .
M	so they replaced it with an identical one , but that kept loosing time aswell .
F	would definitely recommend it to all primary_school teachers .
M	fantastic service , they really know their stuff helped_me get the right replacement parts for my v0 vantage at a reasonable price .
M	fingers_crossed they appear to be fine having had them over a week now but not a good first impression .
F	i cant really complain because its money for nothing but most really i would not join if the cash_back was so good but hence they don_'_t track and have to open up claims . cant bame cash_back but the sellers should not be on the site .
F	have redeemed my first purchase through cashback .
M	i was also told by the salesman that a 0 hour time_slot would be given for delivery .
F	some food tins damaged on opening the package .
F	except oil split everywhere , have to clean other products which cover with fushi oil i ordered - i thought i shall get part compensation for that
F	each email i sent asking for an estimated dispatch date , was followed with the most_unhelpful reply along the lines of , your beanbag will be dispatched in due course and you will receive a email_advising of a delivery date .
M	without having the " pleasure " of staying at the hotel .
F	used site and discount_code easter00 but it did not work , feel conned .
M	i expect they probably beat them on paying their proper share of uk tax too ?
F	we signed a years contract with phs after_comparing_prices for different suppliers .
F	lastminute . com have totally messed_up a 0 day trip to lisbon fior me and 0 of my friends .
M	i love the whey_protein chocolate powder just goes down so nice everytime and also i have seen very good gains from it .
F	disgusted with service - use this company at your_peril .
F	i would place orders again .
M	always been a pleasant_experience when arriving at airport .
F	the beam bags are great , good quality and value for money .
M	and the build quality is superb ; i was really astonished at the solidity of the components , even down to the full length mudguards , very important as we need that transport in all_weathers .
M	do not use .
M	company only seemed interested in delivering as many sales as possible in one day with little thought to the health and safety of customers .
F	would give no stars if option was available
M	0 times canceled for no reson
M	it would have been cheaper for me to buy local and collect same day as the saving was less_than the hire cost .
M	i would not recommend this company to my worst_enemy , and as far as i '_m concerned they should refund me every_penny i have paid them as they are incapable of fixing anything .
F	the price was a really competitive one and customer reviews regarding the supplier were favourable .
M	however , one of the parts i ordered was out if stock but this was not stated on the site , and only came to light when i called to chase .
F	order came through when it was expected .
M	as a photographer my knowledge on microphones and other audio_equipment can be printed on a stamp .
M	the parcel was delivered safely in usa in just under 00_hours .
F	this help made up for the wrong estimation of delivery which was very annoying
F	wide_choice online , reasonably_priced , speedy delivery , good quality lilac plant
M	fast shipping i have no_complaints .
M	i wouldn_'_t hesitate to recommend rx_sport to any anyone .
M	had no incidents so no claim made
F	the price was good so i went_ahead and ordered but i didn_'_t realise they use a courier for delivery .
M	good value and fast delivery i would use this company again and would recommend it to anyone
F	great easy to use website , and quick service .
M	i would say i was forced to terminate the contract with xln purely_because of their awful customer service .
F	the order arrives in record_time and always correct .
F	ebookers told me i had to contact the airline_directly . once i finally got through to the airline , i was told i could only cancel through my booking agent , who was ebookers .
M	the assistant refuses point_blank to accept it , even when i ' d said his own customer_services had said i could return it .
M	avoid .
F	the complaints and after sales_team do not know the meaning of customer service .
F	!
F	it didnt arrive 0_days before my sons_birthday when it was due & we chased & chased with no joy .
F	the steaks all look pretty similar ( with the exception of the fillets ) & it will be interesting to see how they eat as they are fairly thinly cut , which is a pity .
M	after complaining they delivered very late in the evening and this resulted_in another day of lost wages .
M	likewise , a seller could potentially defraud a buyer with the same " proof ".
F	like the last reviewer i have never written an online review of a company before so goes to show how angry i am at the service i have received , i only wish i '_d seen all the bad_reviews before i chose to use them and saved_myself from being completely ripped_off
M	the neighbours cats had obviously been at it as it was all ripped and the contents ( a £_000 motherboard ) was lying at the side of it , very wet and mouldy .
M	so i use magic_madhouse often !
M	didnt arrive at all , no call to say why , looked on the site and in the q & a it said if order code is ps ?
F	i emailed them back saying i would like the voucher or my money back soonest as the deal was due to expire .
F	delivered exactly in the 0 hour time_slot .
F	i purchased the lg 00lm000v smart_tv , the customer service was second to none .
F	quick order price & delivery .
M	will use them again .
M	asked for explanation and was fobbed_off .
M	they set the date of my dd for the end of the month , 00th , which i immedeiately advised was unsuitable and requested that they change to the begining of the month so i could guarantee funds would be available .
M	exceptional value for money .
F	look out for regular offers which makes the experience even more pleasant !
M	i am travelling tomorrow so have no further review regarding the company until my return .
M	can '_t rate them highly_enough .
F	options allowed me to email and check / verify the colour that both day and evening_invitations were cream .
F	after shopping around the best offer i had for it was around £_00 with music_magpie offering only £ 0 .
F	every other booking site did including booking . com .
F	prices are compatible wiv other_companies and took more dvds / cds than other_companies .
F	in addition to this , they checked the box that stated i wanted to replace the item , when i couldn_'_t have been clearer that i wanted a refund .
F	and i hope you don_'_t either .
F	very convenient and well priced .
M	he told me this was not possible !
M	flowers were ok but there was too few .
F	i wanted insurance for my holiday .
F	one happy customer here who will be returning .
M	can '_t fault .
M	so i google ’ d what i wanted and the results included " my tuxedo ".
M	i got new ones printed and that took another 0 days to get .
M	they have real expertise at a detailed level - but know how to explain it clearly and use it wisely .
M	exactly_what ordered delivered on time
F	mmmmmm '
M	after my initial tentative enquiry via_email , my early reservations ( re mail order on such a major purchase ) were dispelled .
F	very . co . uk has put me off using any other catalogue , they are awful .
M	got child item once instead of an adult one .
F	then i was informed my order would be delivered on friday and i would receive a call on thurs .
M	an easy o navigate web_site that made ordering easy .
F	worst company ever .
F	if you are reading this please someone sort this .
M	i recently_purchased a second watch from watchfinder having been very pleased with my first an omega_speedmaster .
F	i bought a ' judge ' milk frother , as i '_m a latte freak and the coffee shops are getting a little too expensive for my taste .
M	all i will say , is " buyer_beware ."
F	' very ' sent me an_email with a code for £_00 off , redeemed the code and got no discount , turns_out the discount comes off my next order , the email said nothing about that and implied that it was for my current order .
F	but when they basically laugh at you for being so stupid as to trust them , it '_s beyond a joke .
F	when i tried to start again i was ' told ' that there was already an account in that name .
M	i '_m still arguing for my refund , so_far i have only been offered another bouquet .
M	decided to use this company after absolutely woeful service from interflora .
F	i '_m really upset for the first time the recipient was disapointed with the flowers she received , apparently in the past the flowers have been ' arranged ' , same order as usual !.
F	there are so many companies these days who treat you disrespectfully when you ask simple questions all you want is someone to take time to explain your options in simple terms .
F	we ' re still_waiting to see if they actually come_back again - some very poor communication in this company .
M	when it came to hiring , the lens turned_up on the day requested , extremely well_packaged , with full manual as well as comprehensive instructions on it '_s return delivery .
F	above_average technical_support line , very good friendly staff
F	we always get argos_vouchers , and always have that within a few_days , but we are kept in the loop via_email to let u know when ure fones been received and when ure argos_card has_been sent out . im so happy with the service that i havent even considered trying out another company . and we will_continue to use mazuma twice a year to recycle our old_phones .
M	i mistakenly_ordered the wrong_size of a boot which i had been wanting for ages .
M	transglobal are not able to give it to us ??
F	i called and left a message with no responce - so emailed .
M	e florist totally failed to deliver my order
F	also only having monday - friday limited hours is a big negative .
F	very poor service !!!
F	my first interaction was through webchat , asking about the service , charges , valuation , photos etc - the guy i spoke with ( mark ) was amazing and even sent me a transcript of our chat by email afterwards .
F	i wish i had more time to make album look more attractive .
F	ordered a dishwasher from them , picked one showing in stock , booked a delivery date with no delivery time , possibly up to 00pm according to the website , though i find it hard to believe they deliver anything so late , meaning i had to wait in all day .
M	edit .
M	services also very friendly .
M	the seal was delivered 0 days_later . i was delighted with the seal and the delivery and intend to order other seals for spares for the future .
F	the police state its a civil case so can '_t do anything !
F	this did not happen so at 00 . 00 i phoned them , after 00_minutes of being on hold i was then told that the manager was in a meeting but they will be sending my treadmill out that day so i would get it on monday and would not be charged the delivery .
M	their service is amazing , the speeds are always great , the customer service is amazing .
M	it should be made clear that you do not do a weekend delivery like most businesses these days .
F	courteous , clear in instructions .
F	- pool only cleaned once during x0 week stay , when compared to other villa_holidays in lanzarote this is the least i have seen somewhere cleaned .
F	all the time we had problems not once did the ' salesman ' come to see what was wrong we had to go to him and chase for everything , as we are doing now for the extra_cost incurred by us for the fitters .
F	who needs shops !
M	green man gaming included an offer for any user who voted in the golden joystick awards in 0000 .
F	it turn out they did not and 0_days_later i have decided to cancel the account .
F	i would use them again but not for something that i urgently require .
M	if your logged in you should be able to comment .
M	luckily they were not pinched and were clingfilm wrapped but as we did not get there until just before 0am , they had been sat outside on their own for over an_hour .
F	the product that i purchase was available slightly cheaper on another site , but they did not provide the additional service of fast delivery and for me this was vital as i had a tight_deadline for when i needed my purchase .
M	no_frills service
M	goods arrive well_packed and very quickly ( ordered sunday_evening , arrived tuesday_morning !).
F	i think the most difficult part about working with them is that it is hard to feel really secure putting details on the site because i haven_'_t seen any security information and it doesn_'_t feel secure , though they have always given good service .
F	if only i '_d read the reviews before i placed my order .
F	they gave_me the email address that i complained to a fortnight ago and didn_'_t receive a response from .
F	possibly a company with too much work and too few resources .
F	they refused to give me my money back saying nobody in the company had the authority to do that .
F	i called after 00 days , on a thursday and was told it should definitely be in by the next monday latest wednesday .
M	next_day , 0000hrs , city_link '_s website again informed me that delivery would take place 0000 - 0000hrs this then changed , without_any attempt to notify the customer , to 0000 - 0000hrs - bit late if you ' d planned your day .
F	i ordered 0 bottles of perfume - a lot_cheaper_than_anywhere_else i have looked .
M	btw the car i purchased has also developed a fault since purchase it looks_like the dual mass flywheel is failing and according to people who i have spoken to this would have been noticeable at a service ( which was supposedly done just before i picked_up the vehicle )
F	i ordered corn meal , pepperidge farm stuffing mix , jiffy corn bread mix and several cans of pumpkin pie filling .
M	every_single time i have had a yodel delivery there has_been a multitude of problems .
F	they were wrapped extremely well and arrived within two_days of purchase / order .
F	i ordered an item for next_day delivery ( for a special event ), then received text_messages to say my item would not arrive until 0th_december ( a few_weeks after ordering ).
F	was delivered in a timely_manner although i '_m almost certain i paid for my purchase to be gift_wrapped and it wasn_'_t .
M	this is particularly annoying when i have just booked one hotel and have to book another one immediately after .
F	work is good but needing to see as a review at the end would save any changes
M	will use again
M	i havd tried to call them several_times on saturday_morning ( as i have today at 0 . 00pm ) but simply get a constant unanswered ringing .
F	i am so excited for our 0 day trip to new_york over xmas and thanks to away 0 i am sure we are going to have a trip of a lifetime !
F	i would use this company again .
F	very tasty and easy to heat up .
F	i would never use this company again and wouldnt recommend anybody_else to use them if you dont want to be let_down .
M	it '_s appalling that i had to chase them to find this out , and they also could have at_least sent the remaining item that was in stock .
M	then we ordered the tiles chosen and they arrived 0 days_later and we were called by the delivery company to let us know and to check everything was ok .
F	the parcels arrive in the original packaging and with no damage at all .
F	all they had to do was send a pack through the post it '_s a self managed
M	).
M	also the reference_numbers from you and booking . com are different again very confusing , because before i booked via alpha_rooms i had found the same apartment on booking . com site .
F	i would definitely recommend chillisauce .
F	prices competitive too .
M	they didn_'_t resolve the matter but communication was good
F	item arrived on time even during the olympics and is exactly as_described , size is perfect and good quality clothing .
F	ergo , employers direct are a subsidiary of peninsula business services .
F	the inc club was closed so we called customer_services from 0 . 00pm we were trying and each time we were left on hold for 00_minutes finally we got through at 0 . 00 and only to our shock were told our nearest_collection_point was victoria .
F	brilliant service
M	good prices and prompt delivery .
F	i got free delivery and it arrived earlier_than i thought so the service is good as well .
M	we have a community project , within which we will use the magnets .
M	i feel they could '_ve been more on the ball and identified this much sooner saving me a week without a much needed headset which i '_ve sourced elsewhere .
M	we ordered our internet online .
M	!
M	really pleased with the goods i got - just one item was not the same as the website picture and had to be returned .
F	the other pots had had labels taken off because there was still part of the label showing .
M	so , out of 0 products , all ordered at the same size , 0 were perfect , 0 was miles to big and 0 was miles to small ?
F	hi , i love the flowers from prestige but found the website frustrating and not very helpful .
M	thinking it would be more efficient if they used the customer reference_number which had been supplied in the original email , i offered that instead .
F	sorry
M	they do seem to have stock issues , but that aside , i '_m just waiting now for another lens to come in stock so i can order again !
F	the website is easy to use with a good selection of products .
F	bad_points - boxes in terrible condition , ripped and dirty .
F	ordered exante - most of the soups are fine but the chocolate shake smells and tastes of wet dog .
M	best not to have them sent directly to someone , but have them sent to you first and prepare them before giving them as a gift .
F	i felt it was not explained to me that when i paid for the protection on my sofa that i was led t_believe my table and tv_unit were included , however when i got home i realised they had charged me an extra £_00 !!
F	i could not believe the speed these glasses were despatched .
F	we nearly lost our tenants who said that their experience with rentify felt like harassment .
M	on a second conversation they said , to return the item and they would send me the correct one .
M	third pair of glasses that i '_ve ordered and once again i '_m very pleased with my purchase !
F	the financial_advisor was efficient , but listened well to gain information needed to produce a suitable plan for my present circumstances .
M	my advice is pay the extra penny a transaction and use a reputable firm that deal with technical break downs within 0 hours and are polite and helpful .
M	item was for a birthday_present so i thought ordering 0 working_days in advance of the published 0 day delivery time would be ok . how wrong i was .
F	good product selection , excellent service & delivered on time
F	we only found them when we put the bins out .
F	so i suggest to people not to trust there review site .
F	i would recommend parcelforce to all my friends .
F	however disappointed as although said gave_me 00_quid for my blackberry_curve it was more like 00 after i had paid for postage back with security of signed for .
F	delivered to the wrong_address no . 0 not 00 . beautiful flowers cant_complain_about that . but my mum didn_'_t get hers until_0pm after the person at no0 finally knocked on the right door .
F	they are very quick t take payment but i am now £_000 . 00 out of pocket and cannot get them to refund this anytime_soon .
M	my original order for business_cards came with distorted text .
M	ordered 0 lights , so_far have received only two good lights and six damaged lights .
M	if i put it on my right knee , the top panel interfered with the stick when open ( and blocks the ipad when closed .
M	fast , efficient and helpful .
F	graet price , little dissappointed on the delivery time but no other complaints ,
M	they didn_'_t reply to emails , i couldn_'_t get through the queuing system on the phone so i went back through uswitch to select a different supplier .
M	the order was taken swiftly and efficiently .
M	it was a simple process and easy and quick .
M	i buy heavy books from amazon , and only pay £ 0 . 00 postage , so just_kampers are , in my opinion , making excessive profit on their postage_charges .
F	this company is brilliant very efficient and good value for money .
F	i have filled a suit with this company .
F	on the following_day i recieved an_email that my title is on the way - now i could see actually , which movie " i have ordered ".
M	an email was sent saying they were testing it and would update when completed , nothing received .
M	this is a company that loses interest in you as a customer the moment you take a contract with them .
F	i think it was left at the front of the house so unsure if she was at home .
F	also delivery was well_packed to ensure little chance of damages - other_companies should take_note !
F	to rub salt into the would i was offered a £_00 discount_voucher to be used on my next oreder .
F	transaction_id_:_0000000
F	no way will i use this company again , slow at answering emails , no reply on the phone as its always engaged , flowers never arrived !
M	my first time using parts_gateway has not been good . the main_reason was the part i was supplied with was fauly / heavy corrosion and with the incorrect abs lead fitted ( obvious not for my car , i confirmed this with renault who did not recognise part number of abs lead fitted ). i called the supplier rp services who were not very helpfull and said if i return item ( extra_cost of postage ) they would inspect and if found faulty they might return money . as part was needed i sought alternative supply and decide to cut my loss .
M	i haven_'_t noticed that my website was down during those 0 months , the apps / widgets are working fine but there '_s 0 thing that kills me :
M	il 0 novembre , ho_acquistato uno speaker bluetooth dato come disponibile sul sito .
F	i thought that was pretty lame but i couldn_'_t really say anything because she gave a very forceful air of " i don_'_t care ".
M	excellent product and service , highly_recommend .
F	if things go_wrong or you are unhappy with the service there is absolutely no redress with netflix .
M	i was delighted to find an online seller with a clear website where i could confidently purchase a spare_part for my triton aquasense shower .
M	excellent service .
M	requested tree > 0 . 00m due to planning requirements as per tree preservation order , once planted only 0 . 0m and this was after ringing to confirm size was acceptable .
F	i had to drill extra holes for the props for the legs as the original holes were too small for the bar of the props and two of the top slats stand proud by at_least an inch where the nails have gone in but not into the frame .
F	what '_s more it took 0_days to arrive which is ridiculous for so called 0st_class .
F	i finally found some at the kitchen_appliance centre and they work just fine .
F	everyone was helpful , courteous and generous .
M	anyways i dont have any complain .
M	i changed the delivery date last_minute without_any bother hence i couldn_'_t be more pleased with their service and will be ordering from them again .
F	i called them and was told that i could leave the card on door the next_day and they could then leave the delivery round the back .
F	have used glasses_direct for a few_years_now , but am disappointed with the difference is fit with various pairs .
F	i sent my phone and within days the money was in my bank , excellent
F	it ’_s up to you now you have the opportunity to put all of this right .
F	i have presumed the way the process works , it must have been my erorr albeit i can '_t for the life of me see how i mistyped the date on 0 occasions .
F	this happened very quickly but i wondered_why it took 0_days to find out the item was out of stock .
M	we simply registered with anyvan with our email and password , described what , where and when - what we needed transporting , followed_by our collection and delivery locations , and our preferred date / time .
M	my neighbour took them in , when we came home today they were dreadful she said they turned_up after 0pm and looked the worst for wear
M	!
M	roger
F	the price was good but the quality was lacking so i will not be purchasing anymore cartridges from you
M	this is dreadful service and i feel like taking the business elsewhere . i have no axes to complain_about the banking side of things as they do a great job but on the mortgage side they have a poor rating .
F	i booked a ryanair ticket stansted to karlsruhe online through bravofly , only to receive a jumbled email the next_day saying payment had not gone_through , querying something to do with my credit_card .
M	on time and fast fitment .
F	the luggage for me and my husband cost us £_00 on top of e . bookers price of £_000 - so in the end i am actually paying way more than i should of .
M	it was a simple process .
F	i ordered riemann p00 once - a - day sunfilter lotion spf00 on the 00th_june , sent a email and phoned on the 00th_june as still not recieved , said it could take up to 0 working_days well it '_s been 0 and still_waiting .
M	well_done morrisons , keep_up the great work .
M	one of the boxes looked slightly_damaged , got it home to find there was no fixings with it , and they had been removed .
M	thomas
M	time mid - morning so cant_complain overall i paid more than_anticipated .
M	great one stop_shop for most of your workshop needs .
F	the perfume arrived_safely few_days_later .
M	pet_supermarket is an easy to use online site that provides all you need for your pet at competitive_prices with fast delivery of orders .
M	the company were quick to acknowledge the order but very slow and evasive responding to questions about delivery .
M	product arrived fairly quickly and well_packaged .
F	i '_m tired of this company '_s broken_promises .
M	fast delivery even over the christmas_period .
F	ordered 0 big_boy bean_bags for my daughter '_s for christmas on 0th_november .
M	they clearly don_'_t understand their customers
M	for the car i had , a full_tank from empty costs 00_euros , but the charge was 00_euros from europe car .
M	now 0yr later recieved a letter wanting a total of £_000 . 00 for 0nd year of contract - now i was never told or aware of this .
F	i would not recommend this company to me worst_enemy
F	to which he put the phone down on me .
F	absolutely worse service ever !
M	i '_ll probably use rental_cars again but their customer service needs a rethink .
M	email stated that it would be collected monday between 0 - 0 .
F	great products at a fantastic price , speedy delivery and everything you need !
F	i was happy with serenata '_s services except that when they delivered the flowers , they did not include the message that i had put and as such the recipient was left_wondering who sent the flowers , which was a big_disappointment for me , especially when i had gone out of my way to source a local company and not gone for interflora as i ` normally do .
M	i '_ve got a couple of weeks of supplements to get through , so time will tell .
M	worst customer service ever do not use cos if they mess up your order it will cost you to fix .
F	good idea for collections when you ' re not familiar with local courier firms and the job is outside your local area , but i was let_down by the first courier and had to re - post the job and make alternative_arrangements which was a bit stressful at the time .
M	i order things from here quite a lot and i ' d recommend them to anyone who_wants guitar_related bits in their life .
F	but what i am no satisfied is a i sent a email to chemist help_desk services on my order and till now none had replied my mail , in my opinion no trustful services .
M	no_complaints just great
M	the quality of flowers was not that great .
F	takes so much more time to then made my order .
F	would love a bit of discount now and again , but appreciate the free_postage and packing .
M	the car was clean , very low_mileage and in excellent condition .
F	i have bought many things from this company .
M	everything_went perfect .
F	i ordered 0 packets of powdered barley_grass .
M	it took three emails before they finally accepted that i wanted my money back .
M	i also just bought the items from their competitor .
M	purchased a laptop at £ 0000 , that already had £_000 off , then got another £_000 discount , very happy with that .
F	found a calling_card that had been left in my mail box advising me that the trainers had been left down the side of house .
M	product looks good and is well_packaged but haven_'_t used yet
F	your customer service is pointless - there is no customer service !!!!!
M	according to parcelhero staff , fedex does not carry knives and my parcel could have been impounded in uk by the authorities .
F	if you need quality products for your pet look no further than here , it has the brands i like burns for example which is hard to buyin my area at competitive_prices the delivery is no_hassle and prompt why go to a shop and lug the stuff home ???
F	vistaprint is a useful site for me as a budding avon rep whose hands cramp something chronic after writing out my information 000 times on the order forms .
F	friendly service , perfect communicaton .
M	your comments here demonstrate it , and i find it an interesting diversion to observe how your responses and claimed the world it out to get you and how good you are on other forums etc ( i googled you and these reviews on trustpilot are actually your best ones !)
F	the big hamburger has lasted 0_days til now ans is still whole .
F	perfect meals for one with fast delivery thrown in !
M	i found the system worked well , worked first time , and was hassle - free .
M	if you need glasses go here
F	i love getting the reminder and the speed of delivery after order is great .
M	i could not accept this and had to make alternative_arrangements as i had to be in birmingham at an appointed time .
F	i purchased a photo_cushion as a gift it was sent directly to the recipient .
F	the villa was well_equipped and clean .
M	i would still use the online shopping service provided but am aware of possible occasional disappointment .
F	i need it for this weekend .
M	however , the front and back covers were still printed much too darkly , as compared to the ' rehearsal ', using the same digital files .
M	there is no ability to talk with customer service over the phone so i will take my loss and go somewhere_else , 0 positive is that it was delivered quickly .
F	easy to discover they had the part , and delivered fast
F	although the second activity we changed to i feel was much_better on the actual night it just caused myself as the organiser unnecessary_stress .
F	thank_you !
F	from_start to finish everything went_smoothly .
M	when i questioned the product i was given " useful_tips " to prevent this happening but it is virtually_impossible to stop , thus decreasing the life expectancy of the product .
F	apparently they came in a nice box but the ' deluxe ' bouquet i had paid_extra for consisted of 0 carnations , 0 or 0 antirrhinums and 0 stems with white berries on .
F	horrible company will never use ever again not customer based just god awful in general not plesant at all .
M	so here we are many weeks_later , ombudsman involved and i have a new supplier and still no obvious progress , final_bill with them now paid - i had over £_000 in credit and after settling the final_bill at changeover time they owe me £_000 , rang them and they can only send a cheque to pay me , i asked why they cant simply credit my account - they have the details from the direct_debits - sorry cant do , we are only allowed to send a cheque .
F	very impressed , i ordered the part on sunday morning and it arrived tuesday .
F	i ordered a pair of raybans and received them within 0 working_days on standard delivery which was great .
M	not what i expected for something that was done by a courier .
F	blinds_0go had just what we wanted .
F	the product was received very fast , by a well - known delivery company , and was packed extremely well .
F	i am no getting a little_worried that i will have to go out and but another present .
M	keep_up the good work .
M	you are going to pay at_least £_00 / month more due to calling these numbers .
M	a handful of years back you couldn_'_t beat them .
M	in the event i ended_up paying an additional 00_euros a day for avis ' all inclusive ' insurance so recommend you do not purchase insurance from rentalcars .
F	disappointed that i had to pay the carriage_costs of £_00 on returning an item that proved too heavy to use .
M	i am not happy at all with the un profressional way the flowers and choclates were delivered to the wrong_address and left out in the rain rendering the choclates inedible ,
F	and no . to be honest no change in first week , all in all . pretty poo !!
M	to sum_up worst telecom i have ever been involved with .
M	pictures are available if you want them
F	arranged for a delivery on friday between_0am - 0pm .
M	was okay but probable wont use again , some of the flowers were broken and turning_brown and not worth the money , thought it was going to be bigger but pretty disappointed to be honest !
M	i posted a parcel that never arrived ,
M	i tried to sought it out as politely has possible .
M	they replied to the first e_- mail on 00 / 00 and the second e_- mail on 00 / 00 - both 0 days_later than the initial query - this is supposed to be soon ???
F	always have good contact from them as well
F	would definitely use them again .
F	how do you get through to these people i am demented .
M	when it eventually arrived it had been with the couriers for over 00 days , as they couldn_'_t find another suitable delivery slot !
F	after struggling to fill in the order online i had to ring the customer service team twice for help .

M	john barnes , anglesey .
F	yet again i wish to thank_you for the quality service you provide
M	we planted 00 seeds and 00 popped not bad , not great
F	i am impressed with their prompt and attentive service .
F	the two guys doing the drop were really lovely too - nice , friendly blokes .
F	pleased with delivery time and communication .
F	i find the on line parking booking very frustrating - when i try to book parking and fast track together - only the fast track is accepted .
M	the remaining transaction was very smooth .
F	. having purchased two sideboards and a table from this company i now wanted to order a dressing_table
M	it was dispatched the same day as i ordered it and arrived quicker_than i thought it would .
M	all i can say is , what a shocking customer experience .
M	i did a judgement call and decided to aim straight for the long_stay car_park at terminal 0 instead of taking a chance and trudging on to wraysbury .
M	ok yodel , so on your website you say :
F	i was massively impressed when the order arrived next_day and was all there .
F	nevertheless , paid mine through paypal though , still hassle - free
F	unfortunately the delivery was not ' till nearly 0pm when , like many people do on their ' special day ', had already left to celebrate !
F	find your shoes somewhere_else !
M	chris suggested some alternatives and initially i was not that keen on them .
F	other_sites just don_'_t let you order i '_d you exceed the quantity allowed inadvertently .
F	by the end of september it still hadn_'_t arrived so i sent an_email , followed_by a phone_call to the office .
F	i would not_hesitate to use them again .
F	it was definitely their fault - i mean i bought it from them .
M	going to be making regualr orders after my first ' test ' order !
F	as it hasn_'_t ever actually worked , how can it be repaired .
M	after to speaking to sony , no not the case , so a bit of too and from there .
F	i '_m not sure if they have changed shipping companies but an order which would have arrived within 0 - 0_days previously took 00 days this time ?
F	this was very helpful and i also discovered that their human vitamins and minerals were competitively_priced so will buy these from them in the future too !
F	having turned_up early to get two front_tyres_changed , it then took 0hr 00mins for the work to be carried .
M	unfortunately upon_arrival at the airport it was almost 0 hours before our shared shuttle took off .
F	this made my descision to choose their service .
F	because i booked it without cancellation clause , i could not even cancel .
M	excellent customer service , quick delivery , would not_hesitate using this company again
M	the laptop battery failed after 00 months into a 0 year warrenty and batteries - trade . co . uk would not send a replacement battery .
F	also , i live in north_east scotland , so i had no expectations of a quick delivery .
M	when i went to your local_depot , to get my 0 new tyres at a cost of £_000 , it was found that the locking_wheel_nut was damaged and the depot could not do anything so i had to find another garage who had the correct equipment .
M	just received the charles_eames style rar rocking chair for kids . the chair looks brilliant and the finish is outstanding .
F	after_trawling the internet for a replacement i came apon this lot .
F	i was 0_months pregnant , it was a crush with idiots who have to run and push their way to the front to try to get the best seats regardless of other people they knock out of the way ( there are enough seats for everyone get a grip ) and i never got a drink although i asked 0 times ,
M	thats a small sample of maybe 00 packages .
F	it didn_'_t turn out that good as the sample on the website has shown .
M	i presume he wanted the sale of the larger av_receiver .
M	would never use again and would not reccomend .
M	how better to fly .
M	the price and the quality were excellent although there were a few screws_missing but i managed to fit my own .
M	i have a host of illnesses i need to sort but because o0 decided to be lazy and useless i now have to wait_until tomorrow .
F	being a student , and getting no money off with nhs left me struggling with what to do as i could not afford a pair of glasses that would not make me feel ill ( very large framed ones ) from a high_street_opticians so i took to the internet searching for cheap online glasses .
F	customer_services emailed me back , i was expecting a nice response , possibly an_apology and that maybe they would look into my issue or perhaps re - evaluate the way they market their product in the future .
M	i wish all on line traders would use this simple method of keeping the customer fully_informed .
M	would use again and recommend to friends and family
F	must_say that since this they contacted me and gave_me a full_refund - still won_'_t be using them again though .
M	i have tried to communicate with customer_services at tripadvisor but all they seem to do is put your email on hold for 00_hours so that it looks_like they are doing something but they are really not .
M	i get get the products for the same price i would get them if i had a local shop .
M	it was suggested i needed varifocals so as to enable smooth reading of dials & gauges whilst driving & also enable long sight .
M	pilot jumper arrived quickly , in perfect_condition .
M	and now their is no garauntee i will get the item by christmas and i am appauled by this !
M	two_weeks_later , i call them ( note , not the other way round ), only to be told that suddenly the part is out of stock , that someone must have coincidentally ordered the same ( very rare ) part at exactly the same time .
F	i know you have email but i wanted to talk to customer_services personally .
F	everyone i have phoned up have been very helpful .
M	my ( husband '_s ) 0 photos were subtle in tone and colour but with a fresh ( winter ) sparkle to them - this was lost in the cards and the colours appeared dulled and in one case ' greyed '.
F	i would not recommed them 0 anyone .
F	but !
M	items were sent out and received them promptly within a couple of days .
F	not impressed with delivery company .
F	over a week waiting for delivery isn_'_t acceptable in my opinion , i have ordered these products from other_companies and received within 0_days !
M	the films are 0 - 0 years old unless you want to pay for box office .
M	the delivery communication was first_class - best i '_ve had .
M	unfortunately , my order of five radiators came from two different_locations , at different times and not within the time - frame i was expecting .
M	and stay_away from kitchen italia !!!
M	takes a lots of time to compile .
F	firstly the website : not user_friendly , search for something using the filters on ebay and you '_ll see how a big site should function .
F	so city_link , the next time i order and you have to deliver , if your driver ever trespasses on property that is clearly locked and is not to be accessed by the public , i will file a complaint with the police .
M	highly_recommended .
F	despite having stressed to rentify personnel on a number of occasions that i needed the reference checks quickly , as i was concerned i would either lose the tenants , or lose a full weeks rent if they couldn_'_t move in on a specific date .
F	i have been told that there are sometimes coupons but i have never seen any .
M	normally i am pleased with apple as they generally delivery within a week and the quality is top_notch but on this occasion i had to wait 0_weeks for my order which apparently was in stock , not particularly good in this day and age .
M	a good company but the computer says no !
M	i placed my order .
F	thank_you
M	you did exactly as promised .
F	it didn_'_t say anywhere on the bill how i could get the money back .
M	the engineer attended and visual checked the boiler for half an_hour .
M	i renewed one of my domain_names
M	eventually got paid out though , but it was quite a wait .
F	they use yodel who just dump your order outside your house , even in the rain and whether your in or not !
F	saa shop has an amazing range of art_materials and i have been really pleased with the paints , paper and other materials i have purchased since i joined a year_ago .
M	was out of stock from main store but recieved a phone_call the day after ordering to confirm that i was happy to wait .
M	i wanted to give no stars , but it wouldn_'_t let_me .
M	recommended .
M	the website is simple , the choice of clothing is very broad .
M	the parcel was sent back to crawley . we were informed that we had to pay £_00
M	this is despite the fact that the default_setting of the aic is to be not actived .
M	received money within a couple of days .
F	not happy that i had to pay £_00 booking_fee for 0 tickets when the tickets were expensive enough as it was .
M	very fast turnround .
M	do not use !
F	they could see there was a problem with the account and it would be sorted .
F	ordered two bouquets , at the same time , to be delivered to the same address , on the same day .
M	beyond all understanding the 0 speakers were split into 0 separate_orders .
F	surprised as other items from store have been excellent .
F	i have bought several items from wowcher and will never buy from them again after this utter_rubbish customer experience !
F	the goods where good value for money however to date i have still not received and call back after sending 0 written emails :-(
M	still_waiting on the items 00 days after ordering , after being charged £ 0 for delivery .
F	thankfully i live local to a store .
M	my wife discovered an item on her till receipt that she did not buy .
F	order due for delivery on 00 / 0 / 00 text_message and e_- mail to confirm , never arrived so phoned jjb on 00 / 0 / 00 was told they would check getting delivered 00 / 0 / 00 .
F	cheap is not always cheerful .
M	the merchandise was not quite as expected so more information on their website would have been helpful .
M	this product is described as dewalt de0000 charger 0 . 0v - 00 . 0v 0 . 0ah and 0ah nicd batteries .
M	the booking was all fine .
M	bestilte for 00 dage siden et lydkort .
M	ordered two big bags for trip to oz and arrived quickly , hence totally uneventful experience , which is what you want .
M	i would steer_clear of this website as there is no way to tell if the review is true or not .
M	some of the larger , yellow orchids were turning_brown upon_arrival which you would not expect for the price of the arrangement .
M	you have been_warned do not deal with these_cowboys
F	my partner in this time rebooked at the higher price as he did not want it to go up even more and he wasn_'_t aware that they had already charged the account and they had no record as he was at work and so was i !
F	very happy with service and excellent product .
M	00 weeks tomorrow since i placed my order .
F	at point of order i was told that item was in stock .
M	the box even had foot prints all over it .
F	we are now in the day following delivery and the roses are drooped and dead .
F	nope , i got a chunk of text copied out from some sort of manual , it did not in any way answer my complaint .
F	i rang interparcel back & they refused to ring yodel .
F	they are so quick to be delivered , normally next_day . would absolutely recommend
F	they obviously never sent me either package . i have never received them .
F	i order this type specially so that they didn_'_t have to go in a vase !
M	used once so_far , but item great , fast delivery would thoroughly_recommend .
M	i have been offered the opportunity to cancel for one hundred and fifty_pounds or upgrade to a service that i have already paid for at the cost of three hundred_pounds .
F	i couldn_'_t_believe_how annoying this apple stuff is !
F	same with us , a part ( push bar on an suv ) that isn_'_t part of the initial vehicle had minor_damage , but was used against us .
F	i cant understand_why my order came by post the french postal_system is so slow .
F	you get only cnn and bbc world news in english .
F	the chairs have great potential - but as they have not arrived yet we can '_t possibly say how good they - or the company - are .
F	with over 00_minutes to spare , i was in no panic , i was sure that this could be sorted_out so we ambled over to the travel centre to explain , they asked for the seat_numbers ( we had two , two were missing ) so we checked the original e_- mail which read no reserved_seats , despite us having two at_least !
M	atrocious customer service & incompetence .
F	i ordered prescription_sunglasses on 0th_may - frames showed as " in stock " on the website when i ordered .
M	ordered a fridge drawer (£_00 . 00 ) on a thursday_lunchtime to replace a broken item and paid for next_day delivery (£ 0 . 00 ) as i was on leave the following_day to receive the delivery , but was back at work the following week and would not be at home for delivery .
M	so for now netflix will be the beneficiary of amazon and lovefilm '_s loss .
F	i now have no interest if the flowers are delivered or not .
F	i ordered with express delivery which cost over_£ 0 but my parcel took several days to arrive .
F	anything to say on this matter inghams ?
F	the delivery service would not deliver to her flat and would not take away the wood pallet .
M	failing that i will go down there with a baseball bat and wait_until roy blanga , mark hoyt and bradley downes , the owners / directors , turn_up and get the money off them personally !!!
F	the delivery seriously lets them down .
M	great service .
M	escape the hassle !!
F	great to be able to access this product cheaply & effeciently
M	buses frequent , ground very rough , not enough instructions when you get back on how to exit the car_park , make instructions on email more detailed .
F	i have replaced that watch and believe this latest version is even more slinky than the original - it feels so good and fits well .
M	i ordered a tent which was delivered promptly ( after a slight_glitch with the delivery company ).
F	i don_'_t think so !
M	they get the details of your card at the first place and then charge you whatever they want !
M	the result to me was a loss of days pay from work for no furniture with the inconvenience of having to take more annual_leave to rearrange a second delivery date .
F	i was so pleased with the flowers i ordered , they arrived early and my friend was delighted !
M	i logged a formal_complaint at that time and as of now have had no response as of now .
M	it was very cheap , but even so i did expect better ( as i had used this shop before ).
M	a couple of hours on the radiator sorted it – but that ’_s not the point .
F	bit surprising for a 0_star hotel .
F	they wouldn_'_t help , they didn_'_t care that we were stranded with hardly_any money , families to return home to and it was all their fault .
M	for the money its the best out there and you are buying from a good and helpful company spycamera cctv .
F	i make that 00_% increase .
M	al credit to the designers of the kit which is free of mistakes and the instructions are first - class .
M	this bottle of port and 0 glasses was just the present i was looking for , and at a good price .
M	also tried_contacting customer_services and when i eventually got through to them they were no help at all .
M	would `_nt buy from here ever again delivery late , birthday was almost over before they arrived , over rated bouquet teddy_bear and chocolates missing and there contact / complaint help line were useless with a few very well practised excuses teddy and chocolates will turn_up 0 days latei i ` ve been assured get your bouquet from somewhere_else you ` ve been_warned
F	after putting my order through in the morning with specific instructions to where it had to go , my delivery was sent to a different part of the company ( at the other end of town ) after_speaking to customer_services , i was told if get a callback or an_email within 00_mins , as they were waiting on the driver returning .
F	!.
F	on his return call he confirmed i could return the tv box and router , there would be no charge and he would arrange a return delivery bag .
F	why wouldn_'_t you want to get money back off of your online purchases ?
M	i ordered a gopro from proviation however , due to lack of shipments from gopro i ultimately cancelled the order and requested a refund .
M	and the price was about half of what the price would have been in other stores !
F	we had a couple of old samsungs sitting_around doing nothing and decided we might as well get_rid .
F	00 days_later i called my credit_card company and they had not yet received a refund .
M	the prices of the flights are over_inflated .
F	all pieces were in stock .
M	i contacted parcelforce for the fourth time regarding this situation and they have told me they do not have a ref / tracking_number from fedex and in all the years she been working within customer_services they just use the same tracking_number with was given to me from day one .
M	i was told that as the pans were coming directly from the supplier that they would have to contact them .
F	mens blue canvas shoes not very good
M	received the package very rapidly and , per instructions , went to my newly created account to obtain the promised code but alas , no code .
M	no better deal than shop deals ,
M	i would have no_hesitation ordering again or recommending other people to usb0u .
M	the fantastic tariff
M	very chic and fashionable .
F	contacted them and trying to get a result seems unduly long , if you are buying a rpesent most people don_'_t do it it several weeks in_advance so don_'_t have vast quantities of leeway for chasing back and forwards on the subject .
M	having reviewed many options online and on the high_street i realised that the diamond_factory offered the best value rings .
M	my bf0 code arrived just in time for me to preload the game for release_date !
F	he explained all the options to me clearly and comprehensively .
F	ordered three different dresses for size and style and kept one .
M	the whole_experience of ordering from this company has_been excellent .
F	i now have been told the order cannot be cancelled as it is in progress which i do not fall for at all and that i have got to accept delivery then send them back myself and then wait for them to receive them in order for my contract to revert_back to what i had originally .
M	i stopped using this company a few_years_ago after a very poor experience trying to send back a faulty motherboard .
F	it couldn_'_t be any easier - the price quoted was the price i got .
M	still_waiting for tyreleader to collect it and refund .
F	thank_you optical_express .
F	i .
M	i sent several emails asking for proof of delivery and nothing more has_been heard from this company - i must also state that i was unable to contact them by phone because that facility was not available .
F	running a b_& b we have a number of different ages , makes & models of showers .
M	he then just started auguring with me as i would not renew with them as he could not to a better deal .
M	them : " just keep checking the tracking_information every day …"
F	after having such a good experience organising flowers for three work_colleagues recently , i decided i would use this firm to mark my daughter '_s birthday .
M	what else could one ask for ?
M	this item was so beautifully made that it was even better_than on the sales screen .
F	thanks for the swift delivery
F	fast and efficient service .
M	i placed another order early december for delivery on 00st which was not delivered until 00th !
F	i still have not maintained whether insurance is an optional_extra .
M	now i '_m left with 0 bills .
F	it would appear that heatandplum . com have finally gone out of business and the new company that have taken over have said they will not be responsible for any orders placed before 00nd_march and for customers to contact their credit_card company for refunds .
M	after figuring_out my billing_address was incorrect on my saveonlaptops account i went to change it only to find there was no option to do this on the website .
M	c ' etait clair que_la boite a était deja ouvri et que_la boite a était déchiré en ouverture .
M	took 0 hour to assemble each unit .
M	get emails_telling_me it '_s left the same day and week_later no stuff
F	nothing to add as it says it all in the title .
M	the delivery date i was given was wrong .
M	oh and just to add i got an email_saying '' please review your item ''
M	it is now over 00 days since the transaction and i am still without my refund , if this had occurred with my bank or credit_card company the monies would have been refunded straight_away .
F	i ordered 0 cake_tins to make a wedding_cake .
M	my wife has taken to sending a text every time that we lose our connection to say that she wants to cancel our contract because they are in breach of it by not providing an acceptable service .
M	!
M	otherwise product as_described .
M	i live in london .
M	had problems acctvating card , spoke to customer service , said the card would be accivated within the next 00_hours , went to use the card more than 00_hours after the call , no money on the card & had to cancel purchase , this was very emarissing as it was for my wife '_s birhday , sent an email reply to mazuma but not had any reply , not tried the card since , feel this has_been a very bad experince
F	would recommend oak_furniture_land .
F	they have delivered me nothing but headaches peppered with 00 minute fruitless and frustrating calls to their customer helpline , broken_promises and shoddy service .
M	brilliant service .
M	and we do so with a smile !
M	extended_warranty wouldn_'_t cover a head gasket failure ( common fault ).
M	yodel are useless and i would never recommend them to anyone , ever !
M	it takes time and not to mention about the tax .
M	easiest and fastest phone buying service i have used
F	she said it was mine but by now i had little confidence that she knew what she was talking_about .
F	i placed the order on 00th_january - it is now 0st february and i have not received it yet !!!
F	the customer service at the time of ordering were very helpful with the it .
F	this is the response from the advertising_standards authority who just walk_away like shiply - if you use shiply ever read every item on the website and be aware that the cowboy couriers who use their site can cancel your job at any time , walk_away , and it costs them nothing but it costs you bigtime .
M	came through to this website via sky_scanner , where i put in dates for the 00th to the 00th .
M	the bean_bags that we ordered are exactly_what we wanted .
F	then when we moved to a better area , with driveway , cul - de - sac etc i contacted ecar to change the details ( needless to say i haven_'_t rung them once as their call charges are just unrealistic !)
M	i chose a delivery slot and indeed music_magpie were good enough to sent reminders about my collection date .
F	( guess_what they never called ) i am now taking_legal_advice and will be issuing both companies with claims for the cost my parcel , my time , cost of my calls and damages to my business .
M	good service and speed
M	the contacts on your order email confirmation were how i tried to contact you and i have copied them directly from there ;
F	the goods were
F	i would use the company again they had lots of different flowers to choose from .
M	after basically being_fobbed_off about the mistake the same cream reappeared on the website at a much higher price , i found the entire handling of the mistake terrible .
M	makes a change to be given a 0 hour_slot instead of having to wait in all day .
F	finally received my order after 00 working_days .
F	i thought i would receive a 00_%_discount on my order but it is only redeemable on a further purchase .
F	some makes were thrown out of running straightaway ( for my particular needs ) and i was glad to have advice saying if this is important to you consider this make , if you want something_else look at these machines .
F	?
M	pay more , rather_than deal with these horrors
M	obviously i bought it from the other retailer but would have preferred amazon due to their easy return process .
F	the roses were delivered the next_day and the recipient was absolutely_delighted with them .
F	easy ordering system , prompt delivery , what more can you ask for .
F	thank_you .
F	i was kept_updated by e_- mail , as to when they were despatched .
F	an insert on the side of the deal said purchase samsung_s0 zoom you will receive the bundle pack free .
M	i recently used hermes after giving up on them for some years for shockingly rubbish service , it took 0 days ( not including them picking it up on the saturday ) for them to deliver a pc tower which they also managed to dent in the process .
F	unfortunately though the the zip on the costume broke as i was just putting it on for the party .
M	they ' re fantastic .
F	however , when i tried my glasses on for the first time , the frames were wonky .
F	they ' re always phoning to tell me about their awful promotions that i do not care about , i ask them not to but next_day i '_ll get the same call from another person .
M	the prices are competitive , the dispatch was fast and the communication was excellent .
F	i recently ordered some calming tablets for my jrt and a probiotic for my pom who is 00 weeks old , it was given me by a vet , who charged me twice the price , this was exactly the same product and did the same thing , the service was outstanding and very quick , packaged safely and securely , i cannot recommend viovet enough and if i should ever need anything_else they will be the 0st port of call !!
M	of course i '_ve only visited the branch twice , called 0 times and having eventually found a head_office address called them 0 times .
F	thanks !
M	================================================================
M	i think the website is misleading and told swiss_watches this but they state the full terms of the refund policy are available online .
F	it is such a shame because the bed itself is just what i wanted but i think it is unacceptable to have to wait over a month for parts that never came .
F	fantastic range on website and generally good customer service .
M	i extended it straight_away as anything could happen i my tools in my trade .
M	they just aren_'_t competitive and they dont seem to have a wide_variety in each section sticking with brands rather_than customers choice / variety .
M	they did not speak_english so it was very dfifficult to communicate with them , and they made a right mess of my lawn .
M	i phoned them to chat about the guitar and the guy on the end of the phone was very helpful and knew his onions , so to speak .
M	unable to track my order via the website as the order number given says invalid .
F	i had to order an item that needed a prescription , so i downloaded a prescription and my vet filled in the details , this he did for free , nice man , i placed the order with viovet and paid , then sent the prescription in the post , would of scanned it in and sent via_email had my printer not decided to play up , literally upon_receipt of the prescription the items i had ordered were dispatched , so i order on the sunday_evening , sent script in on monday_morning , got my order on wednesday , all in the same week , thats what i call service , i cannot recommend viovet higher , great to deal with , thank_you viovet
F	!
F	travel up showed having a great price but in the end paid £_00 more than the advertised price .
M	!
F	excellent website .
M	we were in all day on the delivery day and number 00 ( 0 doors down ) were not in at all .
F	an engineer was booked to come out , to check for problems - and to install my youview_box because the fact that i hadn_'_t connected it i was told was one of my problems with speed .
F	i appreciate that it was not the fault of the florist that the flowers could not be delivered but i feel_cheated that i had been told they were safely delivered when clearly they were not and if it was not possible to deliver to a next door neighbour surely it would be better to keep them and try to arrange a more appropriate delivery time ( even at extra_cost ) rather_than risk them being lost .
F	the service team couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
F	after looking online for flower_deliveries we finally_settled on serenata_flowers .
F	i would rate this company a 0 .
M	!
M	they tried to diagnose my near dead laptop over the phone , which was an_absolute_nightmare .
F	i '_ve ordered a few_times_now and have never had a problem .
M	i phoned them up today and spoke to their glove / mitt expert who gave_me informed advice .
M	excellent service .
F	trading_standards will be getting a letter from me about the company .
F	great company to deal with , no_pressure to purchase but more than willing to send various designs .
M	0 ) wardrobe
M	all we want to do is get our car without_any complications .
M	toulouse - bordeaux etc .
M	back in the post - let '_s hope it '_s 0rd time lucky for this lacklustre bunch of amateurs .
F	i will not ordering oils again from e_liquid_world , will not be recommending it to my friends as i have done with other_sites as i '_ve just wasted £_00 of my hard_earned_cash on products which aren_'_t as they are described .
F	oh well , it turned_out the shipment has never been delivered , so another free purchase was made .
M	the teddy was vacuum_packed and was meant to spring into action when unpacked but alas he needed cpr and mouth to mouth resuscitation .
M	not only did she sort_out my problem but also reset my password with which i was having trouble .
F	don_'_t go near these_guys if you value your data ; they are scam merchants and from my experience and those of others i have corresponded with , exist to rip people off .
M	i don_'_t and never will have a facebook account .
F	in manila in the phillipines , as it turns_out .
F	i would recommend this company to everyone as service is second to none .
M	cependant tres_bon suivi_de probikeshop qui a fait forcing aupres de mondial relay pour trouver l ' erreur d ' enregistrement .

F	very frustrating
M	!
F	i ordered a brush_set from crown which came with super_fast delivery .
M	arrogant , mealy - mouthed customer service ( call_centre ).
F	i have given them a second chance with this order , i am unlikely to give them a third try !
F	will_defo use again .
F	!
M	website is user_friendly , checkout clear and easy to use with the option of paypal .
M	the instant_streaming is poor ( netflix is far_superior ), the way they send low priority list fillers over the new stuff is irritating , but the worst aspect is what happens when you try and cancel .
F	which is ok , it '_s fine .
M	mine neither .
F	before i knew it the items had arrived - very efficient .
F	what more could you ask for !
F	i have not received any information about a refund , so would appreciate some response .
F	i will definitely be shopping with them again because i know if there is a problem it will be dealt_with efficiently .
M	all this time the website continues to show product as " in stock ".
F	i sent them my phone after they offered me £_00 , guess_what , i then received an_email_saying they had decided it was only worthy £_00 .
M	boe has paid euro 000 while rosendal has paid euro00 , 00 on return .
M	i got the tracking ref from amazon and headed to the citylink website requesting i collect the parcel from the depot on the 00th ( the earliest they were open ).
F	very good service .
F	i had to move them all myself ( ok so i '_m not an old woman but 00 packs of flooring is not light !).
F	however when i booked the suzuki ( or equivalent ), we were extremely disappointed in the gutless toyota that we got .
M	will use different mode of transport in future .
M	the same accessories are much much_cheaper_elsewhere .

M	based on an internet page that said that serenata specialises in flower_deliveries to italy i placed an order for mothers_day a week in advance .
M	as good as you could want .
F	probably wont order again .
F	i had to make a trip on saturday_morning to the post_office in the town near the village where i live pick this up as i was out when it was delivered and had to be signed for , pay for parking etc only to find out it was the wrong one .
M	great prices .
M	unbelievable .
F	i ordered a bouquet a day before i needed them .
M	just shows how the lack of effort by one person could affect a whole company .
M	james
M	not had anything in the post yet .
F	very easy all sorted in a few_days site easy and simple to use
F	i '_m a little_concerned that this is going to confuse the printer and disappointed as i paid over_£_00 for the order !
F	i am now wondering have i placed an order with you and where is it ?
M	decent service , unfortunately nowhere does it mention that customs roms equipped phones will be viewed as faulty .
M	great company , great products but my experience has_been muddied by the delivery and personal effort i had to put into getting me delivery .
F	i had forgotten a special_occasion and srenata helped_me repair what could have been a situation so easy to use , so quick to deliver and the end_result was a wow !
F	i was really disappointed with this as it was for my best friends 00th .
F	this is the second seal i '_ve purchased .
F	the service is shocking
M	i had checked these out on ebay but webtogs were very competitive and always nice to know your dealing_with a repitable trader .
F	this is the first time i have used this company but intend to use it every time i want flowers delivered .
M	above , i describe its customer service lines , which close at the same time as its last collection time of 0000_hrs .
M	i ordered my items as the internet shop stated that they were in stock , this in fact wasn_'_t the case .
F	never again , and i will spread the word about how bad they are .
M	stay_away from these , they are not worthy of your money
F	good shopping_experience .
F	to be able to order on one day and have it delivered the next is wonderful .
M	i then called and the customer service team were really friendly and helpful .
F	i am hoping you can restore my faith in tesco ’_s , supply a valid explanation of what happened and reassure_me that if i continue to shop with you i will never be treated so badly again .
F	the childrens ' party did not live up to the description on the website - no dedicated party host , no cosmic bowling with flashing_lights and no dancing with the party host .
M	saved moved over normal prices , and got instant delivery .
M	i have now approached hsbc to refund my transaction .
F	my experience with waltons was not a good one .
M	which will give your brain cells a good work out .
M	it '_s time to start looking at alternative shops .
M	by 0pm i was bored of waiting , so i rang waltons to ask when the delivery would be , to which i was told " oh , someone should have rung you this morning , to tell you that your replacement panels were damaged in the yard and need to be re - made ".
F	always takes_longer_than estimated .
F	total con .
M	i am pleased to say i recieved the synth early_afternoon so in that respect a happy customer . so whats my point .
M	poor experience for the whole product and service .
M	the furniture is great .
M	i paid 0 . 00 for a sony_xperia case , wrong one was sent to me .
F	cheque was received within a couple of days
F	and their new website is ok .
M	after two_days i chased this and was told they didn_'_t find one of the items when the came to do the picking .
F	i hired this car as a goodwill_gesture for a friend . never ever again will i help anyone out like this again . even_though this was not his error . i have been charged for it and i am the only one out of pocket for doing a good deed .!!
M	the one delivered was £_000 cheaper and they didnt tell me .
M	on the 00th_march , i ordered an item which was ' temporarily_out of stock ' however it '_s now nearly 00 days_later and i '_ve yet to receive an update as to when i might receive the item which is rather frustrating .
F	however up until this point i was very pleased with their service .
M	in all not a good experience .
M	every time i have use your company i have very good service , would recommend you to any one
F	0_days_later i was emailed to say it would be at their warehouse 0 working_days after i had ordered it .
F	his wrist is flopping out of the sling , even_though the elbow is snug to the other end of the sling .
F	i contacted them and asked to them to stop sending invoices but they continued .
F	will not use again .
F	would definitely use this site again and highly_recommend it .
M	0 rose_heads were almost off the stem too .
F	they will not help you if a problem arrises .
M	i then received one radiator which was the incorrect_size .
M	customer service - non_existent .
M	please review the transfers and see if the times can be reduced , even if it means offering a service between private vehicle and the bus e . g .
M	svp used to be a reasonably small company , but it worked well , you saw what goods they had , you ordered them , they had real - time stock control so you knew what was actaully going to turn_up , and in general it did , the next_day .
M	absolute bunch of clowns !
M	go here at your_peril , they don_'_t give a crap for your problems , just get you on board so they can claim another satisfied customer , yeh right .
M	an_absolute_joke of a business , avoid if you can .
F	now surprisingly enough the bathroom is falling_apart .
F	i had to end up telling her as knew she was going out at 0pm and they were still no where to be seen .
M	!
F	the radiator and valves arrived promptly and i was kept well informed re delivery but in fact the valves were the wrong sort - i ordered straight valves but in fact wall type valves were sent .
M	do not advertise products if you do not have them , will this make me buy from you again ?
M	the service i received was fantastic .
F	great service
F	i '_m totally_disgusted as they have not even refunded money to my bank_account .
M	00 out of 00 ☺
F	it is my opinion that wbac are scammers and i am so glad i didn_'_t do_business , but they wasted my time .
M	i will now add that go electric appear to to be equally inept - i checked the order and invoice sent - and both were correct but the delivery was completely wrong .
M	no i use you as a last_resort when items sell out elsewhere .
F	what has obviously happened is the flowers have been delivered by a courier across europe and over the busy christmas_period been lost and left somewhere . then delivered after christmas .
F	excellent flight .
M	the only potential area for improvement is the service offered through 0rd_party vendors .
M	the item is just what i was looking for and does the job very well
M	i '_ve wasted hours of my time waiting in and calling them on their so called helpline that takes an average of forty_minutes to answer .
F	haven_'_t yet put it up but am intending to do that this weekend and should look great outside the house .
M	to put insult to injury they
F	" oh i knocked but there wasn_'_t an answer and i didn_'_t have any cards left ".
F	extra quick delivery
F	i would never buy from anyone_else .
M	this is not about money but the fact that someone can just take goods from you and then pay you what they want to . they had previously sent me an email_saying that items were ok then turn_around and say they have not received them .
F	item finally arrived , without notification , around 00 days_later .
M	what '_s great , the more you clean the car the more wax is left on to protect the car .
F	thank_you so much
F	however i finally_plucked_up the courage to go for a consultation .
F	but then again , the products i ordered ( gluten - free burgers and sausages ) were processed meat products , so for all i know , their ' pure ' meat products , steaks etc .
F	i called the centre for an engineer , i was told an engineer call out was £_000 ?
M	drum - stop delivered on all fronts .
M	they ' re almost comical .
F	i tried_emailing numerous_times and each of these were ignored and then i called to be told the crib was not in stock and i '_d have to wait .
F	after_spending £_000 , i think it deserved to be wrapped better .
F	also being kept_informed through e_- mail very good .
M	following a similar experience with brittany_ferries last_year due to industrial action my account was immediately credited with the fare ,.
F	that eveing i got an_email to say that my bed would be delivered the next_day - as originially scheduled .
F	the printer works_fine , and so far i haven_'_t had to sample the aftersales service .
M	very good slick_operation that is always right first time .
M	at 0 pm i have had a guts full and phone ups who promise me it '_s on it '_s way .
M	another product purchased and again excellent service !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
F	i was really pleased with how the website worked and quick delivery but 0 of the orders i placed were let_down by the delivery .
M	so i left ( getting charged £ 0 . 00 ) and tried again .
F	i guess that '_s their strategy to attract customers .
F	despite_being ready to receive wally at 0am , he had not arrived by 0 . 00am .
F	i would have no_hesitation in recommending viovet , and will certainly use their services again .
M	bought these shoes as a gift for my wife .
M	poor item after 00 days it came unstuck and fell in bath no damage done to the bath but will not use again .
M	i have used other online flowers companies in the past and had no_problems .
F	we went back to get our_wedding_rings .
M	i prefer lonely planet anytime as they never get it wrong .
F	my first sentence_says it all - everything was just as i requested .
M	do not buy from them !
M	well_packaged , fast delivery and excellent communication .
F	this company is only after your money - don_'_t use them at any cost !
F	with a cool pair of sunglasses and a reading_glasses now in use i have passed on the details to several others i know .
M	it annoys_me that you have a miliion brokers and affiliates to these things .
M	i phoned aol to set_up a new phone line and broadband at my new home because i am moving , and they switched me over to talktalk .
M	shortly_after this call i received a call from orange ( who were and still are my provider ).
F	lovely rug but took their time in delivering .
M	however , before purchasing take into_consideration that the courrier used is quite bad , so check elsewhere .
M	?
F	the photo is very misleading and i assume it '_s of the large bouquet .
M	i have made mistake trusting philips and buying them many_times , all of my items sit and breakdown even something as simple as clock , products are designed well however quality is absolutely awful and i will ever recommend anyone to buy philips as you will see it won_'_t be long before you will see issues with product !
F	i have since been on the phone to the help_desk and all the people who i have talked to have been very apologetic yet i have asked for a manager to contact me 0 times and as yet have had no phone_call .
M	prompt delivery .
M	i give it 0_stars as - 0 for instructions & - 0 for quality of materials .
F	but second , and far worse , i bought a matching set of waistcoast and bow_tie that doesn_'_t actually match - even in the dark .
F	my dog was rescued by these_guys back in july_0000 .
F	i ordered medicines for my cat on saturday and received them on tuesday which saved me a trip to the local_vets and a lot of money as much_better service and prices .
M	we '_ll see how we get on with the replacement - but you still get 0_stars - not sure why .
F	i ordered one pair of designer_glasses and got the second one free .
F	i could not change this and , therefore , could not buy the offer .
F	i don_'_t care how competitive other_companies may offer in price for my old_mobiles , for prompt and fuss free transaction , its mazuma for me .
M	second time with this company again excelent service faultless .
M	at this stage we are now being ignored therefore for the sake of a refund of only £_00 wowcher have lost who_knows_how much future custom from us .
M	happy with service got cheque though super quick
M	i sent photo_evidence of this including packaging and close ups of the damage .
M	however , four days_later i did get an email from their complaints_department , apologising for the delay and saying that a replacement had been dispatched by 0st_class mail , which duly_arrived a couple of days_later .
F	website not as easy to navigate as asos .
F	the items and prices are great !
M	the online experience was good but although we paid for next_day delivery it took a few_days to come through and only after we had chased the carrier
F	i would urge_people to avoid using chemist_direct .
M	very happy
M	seriously don_'_t deal with talktalk , they are rip_off_merchants with some dumb agents who call themselves by european names , knowing full well they are indians or whoever the hell they are
M	you may end up with liability of custom fees and there goes your deal .
M	all you need to know is never use this company .
M	i will most_likely use them again thanks to some of their prices and range of flavours , just hope next time the flavours i choose taste more like they should be ;)
F	very happy customer .
F	from now i will be happy to clean - up knowing i will not be fighting for breath after cleaning my rooms as they both work just as well on wooden_floors as carpets .
M	!
F	would not_hesitate in placing an other order with this company .
F	i booked 0 people in 0 different flights , need vegatarian on all and aj was very good but he had to keep putting me on hold .
M	very disappointed with service .
M	recommend will use again
M	i rang some 0 days_later to let them know the consignment had not been delivered .
M	i see that this is not a one off either .
F	if they can ’_t trust you they will go elsewhere .
F	would definitely shop_here again and recommend to others .
F	helen was fantastic !!!!
M	i received no dispatch information so wrote to spoiled brat to query the delay .
M	( there are in fact no_problems with my credit_card , except that i '_ve just moved to a newly_built home whose postcode , though registered by the post_office , does not yet appear on the databases of some private companies , such as pharmacy0u ).
F	hopefully blinds to go will send another pelmet correct_size and neat stoppers for the bottom of the blinds ?
M	it arrived at 0 : 00 which was 00_hours after i ordered it .
F	they went the extra_mile in my opinion with their customer service and i will be recommending them to everyone i know !
F	ordered item , order accepted money paid , then i get a despatched confirmation_email , 0 hours after that i get a ' you have been refunded ' email with the reason ' cannot find item '. that is all fair and well but a ) why send me a despatched email and b ) 0 of there stores have the same model item so why not source one from one of those store so as to not inconvenience a customer .
M	mick storm .
M	fast delivery , but envelope with bubbles and torn boxes , containing the cables did not appear damaged .
F	i am not sure if i would book through rental_cars again , entirely because of this issue .
M	paypal is a gateway to fraud .
F	being a novice on the internet i was recommended the company parcel0go to send my son in america a parcel . i asked for help and chatted on line to daniel who guided_me through it from beginning to end , and the price was lower_than i expected .
M	the email providing status_updates on the progress of the customers order , is a nice_touch .
M	for that reason , i '_m not paying a penny .
M	so i ' d recommend this type of policy for countries where excesses are high ( as much as a $ 0000 in australia and also high in spain ).
M	thanks , i was going out that day which i '_ve now had to cancel .
M	so when i saw lenson '_s advert recently i thought i ' d give then a try .
M	but most od all - i saved £_000
F	i also object to being told i am in the highlands and islands .
M	company who i bought of were brill when i told them about the poor delivery service .
F	both bunches i ordered the colour delivered were very different .
M	the ordering_process was quick and efficient .
M	sales and customer_services staff sound like they are being forced to take your call at gunpoint and go out of their way to be combative and rude , and try to make you sound like you ' re stupid ( hey , i '_m not the one working in a call_centre trying to upsell for a scam merchant ).
F	avoid at all costs .
F	i have sent yet another email today in order to get my money back .
M	it '_s ok but everyday the offers come through and the offers are very poor
F	i was expecting a green vase to go with my friend '_s decor and she received lilac .
M	because it '_s not .
M	we were away from the terminal within 00_minutes after collecting our baggage .
M	at night it drops like a stone , their plusnet forum is awash with people having the same problem .
F	both doors then arrived a day earlier on each_occasion than the scheduled delivery date !
M	the conclusion of this is that i am deeply dissatisfied with the treatment i have received , i can '_t remember when i have experienced such arrogance and poor customer service .
F	the service is spot_on no_qualms whatsoever and they keep you updated with your order and delivery .
F	quick service too !
F	it only had a couple of scratches which most people would agree is normal wear and tear and the scratches were not on the screen .
M	finally the tips for a successful installation a really good idea
M	bought two_sets of decals one set was fine , the other were clearly ancient stock , with a white residue on the printing and signs of water_damage .
F	i ordered a beautiful christmas jumper , which arrived quickly was great quality and everyone loved it .
M	what can i say , the samsung_galaxy_sii is a beautiful phone , well_designed , full of apps and features which are mainly provided by the superb android 0 . 0 . 0 ( ice_cream sandwich ) os .
M	he was happy to help including letting_me know how far away i was travelling .
M	it ran well but something was missing
M	mark .
F	still_waiting for my account to be credited .
F	excellent boots as always and speedy delivery from rubbersole . co . uk
M	i was told , when i rang , that the tyres could not be sourced - but that an_alternative could be supplied .
F	unfortunately both_pairs are for reading - somehow instead of giving me two_pairs with the two different_prescriptions , only the one prescription was used .
M	but they arrived on time both_times and the flight was great .
F	huge choice of products and can always find and get exactly_what we want .
F	the carrier lets you know on the day by email by 0am which specific time_slot you have been allotted .
M	people need to stop using myhermes . fact
F	easy to book and items collected and delivered as quoted and good price .
M	!
F	fab service .
M	on the positive_side gold car provided us with a brand_new car and refunded the unused_fuel .
M	this would have caused me enormous stress and concern that 0 valuable items (£_000_gbp ) were impounded in uk , whilst the receiver in usa waited interminably and perhaps eventually would demand a refund .
M	best thing i ever did response time has_improved amazingly now i can get things done without_worrying if i have enough time to wait for the computer to decide to do what i want .
M	the exact items ordered arrived delivered personally from an old pal from the shop in double quick time .
F	the security_tag was left on one of the items and now i have to return it or take it into a shop to have it removed .
M	*****
F	when my phone went dead realised needed new batteries .
F	eventually my suite was delivered at 0pm on the tuesday , but when i spoke to the delivery company they knew nothing about the order being lost and said it was the fault of better_bathrooms .
F	this company should be investigated .
M	the network itself has decent coverage , although the 0g_signal is not as good in certain_areas as other_networks .
F	arrived on time but slimy and dead on arrival !
M	i cannot really fault them at all .
M	however , these mounts are utterly rubbish and completely undo the principle offered by the nextbase stanchion mounts !
F	the pages in the book would look better in gloss to bring the prints to life .
M	contact information : order number :
F	once in our new cabin the service was great !
M	normally i ' d give at_least four_stars , so to punish one shockingly_bad_experience by ignoring everything that has_gone right in the past and only giving one star now is not entirely fair .
F	i was pretty annoyed when they came through with a face value of £_00 - £_00 each .
F	the order was done around 00 . 00 on saturday
M	. the quality of the lenses is excellent but they ' re to small in my face .
M	ordered name_badges for our surgery which we received with in a week after ordering .
F	i bought an item which they showed as available .
F	i have used a few other_companies , but found i was standing around waiting for quite a long time , both on departure and arrival .
F	0 . worst of all and unforgivable really . there was " no hot_water " -.- none either from the tap or shower !
M	it only had a small piece of bubble_rap around the bulb , the bulb and the wrap would of fitted in a small jiffy_bag no problem
M	the customer_services_department katie and adriana were so friendly and helpful .
F	having been a good customer for christmas and birthday cards i am very disappointed by this shoddy service .
M	would recommend to any body .
M	phone every day for a week and was promised a call back each day .
F	both orders have been sent out promptly and the prices are competitive .
F	i just hope to goodness we do not have any_problems with the goods once installed as it does not forebear well with the experience i have had so far .
F	the bead_shop have a great range of beads , kits and jewellery_making materials .
M	my envelope to post my mobile arrived the day after my initial account was opened .
F	finally , the courier company they use is a disgrace - the chance of your goods being damaged in transit is very high .
F	they will let you know the number of the order so you can trace when they are being delivered but will inform you by text when being dispatched and when delivered .
F	they sent me an extortionately high bill stating that my energy use has tripled !!!!
M	i was notified when the driver was going to be at my address , driver was very helpful and he unwrapped the appliance and took away all the polystyrene etc .
M	good website but still_waiting for my order
M	faultless service and repeat_custom assured .
F	we are extremely pleased with our invitations & would recommend them to everyone
F	i was comparing various similar_sites .
F	would recommend a padded mattress_protector though so you can '_t feel the contour of the mattress .
M	when i went to the budget rental_desk to collect the car they informed me that a group e car ( ford_focus or similar ) had been reserved by holidayautos .
M	i would just like to say that shopping with very is so straight_forward that any one can do it .
M	this organisation wants their customers to use a charged telephone_number .
M	items listed should state if they are in stock or not .
F	really liked a sanderson design ashbee in antique gold after_seeing it in the sales locally .
F	firstly mazuma is the only website i could find where water_damage was included in the ' non working ' option .
F	now not so sure if i should use any of them !
F	firstly why do viagogo give no advance_warning that the tickets will be delivered ?
M	regrettably , although acknowledging that there is a fault with the doors / panels , we have heard_nothing whatsoever from yale since .
F	* update_: returned your call yesterday however as you did not leave your name , receptionist was unable to transfer the call .
M	its obvious that they are only interested in making money for their shareholders and have no morales .
F	brilliant customer service .
M	scott and the team have great product knowledge and offer excellent impartial_advice .
F	three_weeks before a friend '_s wedding day , i ordered some flowers from iflorist to be delivered in the us .
M	this was an excellent buying experience , good quick service , good product and easy to use website . if anyone is thinking of ordering their glasses online then i would have no_hesitation in recommending this company to everyone .
F	again sunbeds were provided here as well .
M	i don_'_t know why people rave_about them .
F	didnt know anything about them , but after calling everything was explained excellent to me . no_hassle , no third_party payments or numerous online forms . fast and honest .
M	plus on an ongoing battle the delivery , after waiting in all day , the delivery was just_dumped on the doorstep , good job the delivery was late , because if it had been earlier i wouldn_'_t have checked with wg and as it was already defrosted and about 00deg c outside so where would that have left me , as the chances of getting replacements would have been slim .
F	paid £_000 for 0 of us to go , only to receive a call from shirley at lastminute stating that the deal did not exist and that i needed to change the date for spa package .
M	on the flip side the product is great now that its arrived and i am happy with its top condition ( almost as new )
M	i believe more support needs to be added for members to learn together and stay motivated .
M	if delivery had been within 0 - 0 days they would have had a 0_star_rating from me but it usually takes a week and recently 0_weeks .
F	good timing for delivery .
M	we all look for the best all_round provider and rms hits the note .
F	clear easy to navigate web_site that gave_me a good selection of items in the product i was looking for
F	- so take it off the site .
M	very good website , easy to navigate .
M	the ordering was easy and the delivery at the expected time .
F	the watch was great if not a little over packaged - at first look i thought they had sent the wrong item as the box was huge .
F	they offered me a £_00 refund and that is all .
M	frankly it is not as good as the simpler one that i '_ve had for 00 years and recently lost , dammit !
M	i am only complaining_about lack of information / lack of tracking_details .
M	if you make big order they always take a long time to process it , sometime they don_'_t have the stuff in stock and they have to order it and that takes 0 - 0 business days for them to get the order and another 0 - 0 business days for you to get your order .
M	i trawled the internet from site to site .
F	their response was that they were sorry i '_d had such a bad_experience and if there was anything more they could do then to let them know . again , ignored my request for either the voucher or my money back ( which i told them again )!
F	well my husband is 00 but only in your last mailing have i seen instructions on how to tell you this .
F	if you ' re thinking of pacing an order beware - apparently you can '_t cancel your order if the promised speedy delivery is actually 0_weeks - the email repsonse stated " the onus is on yourself to ensure that you read through any terms & conditions prior to placing an order " and yet nowhere does it say you can not cancel an order or that you will face a £_00 charge if you do . watch out for this company - don_'_t trust their website they seem skilled at taking your money ( over_£_000 of mine - i '_m still_awaiting any type of refund ) whilst providing nothing in return .
M	recently went in to comet to purchase a new washing_machine .
M	extra memory for my sony laptop was a competitive price .
M	had to call because i made a mistake when ordering was rectified_immediately .
F	i was quite annoyed at this point cos it was a birthday_present that was meant to be for monday .
M	i finally got an email and they offered to deliver the following_day ( mothering tuesday ?!)
M	i hope you can give attention on this issues ,
M	i simply expressed general opinion of the state of uk market .
F	i had my eye on a particular colour of jacket and outdoor_kit seemed to be the only stockist in the land who had the colour / size in stock that i wanted ( the north_face nuptse in fissure green , size medium !).
M	i won_'_t bother_writing a long review as they are sh0t all_round .
M	worktop_express did eventually agree to give me a token of compensation but it was not alot .
F	with ease i was able to add extras to my order and pay with no_hassles .
F	i did phone to try and sort this out , but nothing could be done .
M	so three good reasons for choosing simply_supplements
F	i have re - scheduled for wednesday but given he / she does know where i live ( he / she didn_'_t know where i lived earlier this year either as two garden chairs from tesco were apparently delivered to me and signed for , only naturally they were not - hope the delivery driver had nothing but misery out of sitting on my chairs all summer long ) then how on earth is my expensive electrical item going to get to me on wednesday ?
M	the service was , at one point , quite good , but has degraded to the point of being useless .
F	after doing some_research , i found this the best company to deal with my ebay and amazon photographs .
M	however , as a non tea drinker and someone for whom caffeine is a sure - fire way to a sleepless_night , i was very disappointed to only be offered one type of decaffeinated coffee .
F	also appreciated the regular email_updates once my phone arrived with them .
F	over sixty had a problem ordering on line would not accept password or whatever .
M	i believe it certainly comes under the " light cosmetic_wear and tear is acceptable " policy on your website .
M	since they became pcworld / currys they have got worse and worse it seems to me .
M	this was a very easy process , very quick and you receive your cheque only in a couple of days .
M	00 days_later - not delivered , despite 0 email and 0 telephone_calls from me .
M	i then booked another set of flights for the dates i need and received confirmation from them .
M	i rang for an update and the phone rang for 00_minutes with no answer .
M	called the contact center to explain the situation , long_story_short , treated with contempt from astonishingly rude manager and told a refund would still cost £_00 , despite my wrong booking being their fault due to errors on the website .
M	despite them sorting everything out , the fact that i had to basically bully / threaten them into it means i can '_t possibly award anything more than 0_star .
F	the order was easy to place online and the goods were received the next_day .
M	my advice is before buying make_sure you get a guarantee on the materials or you may have money down the drain .
M	a ) get you to sign up for another contract - preferably with line rental .
F	after the phone_call i received a dispatch email .
F	yes i made a genuine error in assuming basin and bath_taps are one and the same , but this companies entire attitude and lack of due dilligence and care is appalling !
F	quick easy and trustworthy - all you need !
F	delivery was really quick .
M	vote with your wallets guys , dump this software and don_'_t buy a computer with this already installed .
F	both were supposedly collected from the store on the tuesday and then again on the thursday now how the hell can you collect the same parcels twice and 0_days apart !!!!!.
F	i was diagnosed with nhl in 0000 and underwent chemo .
M	will order more meat with westin going forward
F	i never received the replacement fixings and had to call to request twice .
M	mortgage broker used citylink to send back passports , which they aren_'_t insured to carry .
M	take my advice , avoid like the plague , you may pay more from another company but at_least you will get your order and avoid all the hassle .
M	in fact , i ' d probably have done better to buy cover only for the 0 days down under when we won_'_t be covered by our friend '_s policy .
F	well , the delivery did arrive before christmas day .
M	not wishing to risk damaging the monitor , i turned to packard_bell ( uk ), customer_services .
F	incredibly disappointing first experience of shopping with pureluxuries sadly .
M	would highly_recommend them to anyone - best cycling / triathlon store in the uk
F	i suspect i will be told ' no '.
M	i still keep an eye on competitors ' prices and service , but i haven_'_t yet gone anywhere_else for strings and accessories .
F	i was pleased with the delivery and it made a lovely present for my brother and sister in law for their wedding day but very disspoainted with the larger pictures , this should have been flagged before ordering or processing .
F	the price was excellent and the delivery was spot_on .
F	when i called to let you know , i was told the dimensions were for the box .
M	i cancelled the order and received a reply saying the money had been refunded .
F	they seem to say if there is a problem it '_s not their fault and it '_s up to the customer to sort it out or rebook again at extra_cost .
M	apart_from that little_confusion i had a great experience .
M	i was phoned to offer me earlier_than requested delivery date .
F	the red warning lights were now flashing .
F	i will never order from them again .
M	the girl on collections desk was absolutely_brilliant in that as there was no paperwork to mention i was collecting the strimmer from 00pm onwards , she had to phone round and chase up paperwork only to not get anywhere , but luckily there was a strimmer in stock and she was able to sort something out for me .
F	it '_s so hard i have been in real discomfort with my back .
M	experience with sixt , not so .
F	will keep on using them .
F	thank_you .
F	when i couldn_'_t find my car the staff then directed me .
M	helpful emails alerted me to the delivery which was speedy and on time .
M	i always seem to get a consistent result with this site , easy clear to understand
F	!
M	well satisfied thank_you .
F	do not sign up to virgin broadband if you value your sanity !!
F	i showed my receipt from shore and said how upset we were and then the lady agreed to charge the same amount .
F	i sent my phone first time without the battery by mistake even by doing this error i found the whole_process so quick and easy , every thing that was said was done to the letter .
F	a simple sketch on the printout would have made things much clearer .
F	the customer service mamager could not even be bothered to come and speak with me even_though i asked twice and wanted to show it on me .
F	i returned a new cartridge which didn_'_t work and they have denied receiving it .
F	the sevice from bride and groom was excelent .
F	money taken out of my account straight_away , the delivery was late .
F	i am a retired nurse and have used viovet for many_years .
F	poor attitudes of staff .
M	delivery wa quick and timely .
F	i ordered my fridge_freezer over the phone as i had a query and the operator was friendly and helpful .
M	the good points :
F	i was surprised some didn_'_t come with rice ?
F	please_note - this is the second time this has happened .
F	i had never used this company before so was a bit_wary .
M	i placed an order on 0th_december for goods that were in stock and paid for delivery on monday0th .
F	upfront about process and amount i '_d get for the phone .
M	i recollect in the jessops era that there was a specific recommendation that it should be de - activated for images which had been processed in an application such as photoshop .
F	with regular offers and discounts too , i '_m happy to support british business and i will_continue to shop at the bead_shop .
M	in best price and remarkably quick in despatching it . despite the purchase price
F	ordered rosehip_capsules one day - arrived the following_day .
M	will i use this again ??
F	not the usual service from clares .
M	very stressful and messy booking .
M	had to cancel my order .
F	i ordered some memory for my laptop because i was a bit_slow but now wow and it was very fast delivery , so happy .
M	sorry to say this as i have dealt_with this company before with no_problems but this time it was a catalogue of errors , thay accept my order confirmation with correct delivery details , then send an email asking if this was a duplicate order which it wasn , t , then deliver to wrong_address anyway then eventually 0 days_later send flowers to correct address . a mothers_day present that arrived very very late . it is an experience i do not wish to go thro again .
F	i believe that the company who took my money have an obligation to supply the goods that they advertise or refund my money if the order is not fulfilled .
F	the courtesy of an_email would have been nice to let us know there was a problem .
F	it was the first time we felt uneasy leaving our car with a meet and greet service .
M	i was told several_times that someone will call me back to resolve the issue , but they never did .
F	the ordering and delivery of wheelchair was great .
F	i have used aferry on previous_occasions and in my dealings with them have found them to be very efficienrt with prompt_replies by email of my bookings .
M	what a difference , from £_000 to £_000 a month so agreed for andy to act for me .
F	had to chase this up .
M	when you in a hurry my opinion is not help by having to do this and not being_able to pass and not fill this in
F	i confirmed this , as i had a 0 year part warranty and they agreed that was the price .
F	after sending this review , compnay got in touch and refunded my money , i have now booked correct dates with them as they were the most competitive price .
M	this was a present for my sons_birthday .
F	they have now offered me the grand_total of £_00 . 00 refund .
F	items were exactley as_described and as they looked in the picture and a good price too .
M	the refund at_least did go through smoothly .
F	flowers were nice enough , but all in all , poor value for money as the bouquet was smaller_than_expected for the price paid .
M	the selection of products is second to none .
M	they said they would email me details and send out the iphone .
M	obviously this is a customer fault & vodafone can do absolutely nothing to assist .
M	i first thought the " gold package " includes " registered office service " therefore they will forward the important document to me free of charge , but apparently when i fill in the details they ask if i want to use their redirect services otherwise my residential address will be shown as the services address .
M	the ticket arrived via_email showing economy status . i phoned to tell them of their ' mistake ' and was informed that i had only booked an economy ticket .
F	the only small issue we had was i hadn_'_t packaged the phones properly for collection .
F	i guess this time you could say it was very bad_luck i got sent a duff lot and wasted my money .
F	i contacted wally '_s gifts again and matthew ( the only name i have been provided with ) offered a replacement item and refund .
M	their site is simple and easy to navigate with tons of search options .
M	eventually got a call from an indian_call_centre , just saying sorry , and that they dont offer compensation .
M	chose ph after another service let_me down .
F	half the price of royal_mail , dhl etc .
F	basically , it '_s ok but nothing to write home about .
M	they replied it '_s not possible and i will have to send the whole_thing back .
M	she said they didn_'_t usually deliver to a foreign address .
F	a second engineer was booked for the following_day and when he arrived he had not been told what he had to do apart_from ' service tv ' - and he showed me that information that he '_d been sent on his gadget .
F	quick turn_around service
F	very disappointed with this service .
M	i needed to clear away my old cd '_s and dvd '_s as i need the space so thought i ' d use music_magpie as i ' d seen the adverts and the app looked easy to use .
M	you can '_t enter a voucher_code at the online checkout .
F	we will never order from this company again .

F	the sofas are good quality and i '_m_sure they will have a long life span .

M	in response to the reply :
M	would thoroughly_recommend them .
F	i understand that there are several orders to deliver and someone has to be last , but i personally think delivering flowers that late is not good . also the roses have started to go brown only after 0_days , and we have counted 00 pieces of greenery and only 00 flowers . it would have been better to have a few more flowers for the money paid .

M	i received within 0 days .
F	instructions were spot_on .
M	pick_up was good driver polite and was on time , the text and email confirmation was comforting as it was booked online .
F	she active should be reported to the standards of fair_trading .
F	i placed an order for flowers to be delivered to my goddaughter who was in hospital but she was discharged the day before the delivery date .
M	i ordered a camera , lens and a tripod head , i also wrote and asked that before they go_ahead with the payment , to get me a quote for more kit .
F	the serivice we recieved was first_class .
M	i read some of the reviews before i ordered with this company to make_sure that if i did have problems i could get some meaningful back up .
F	given that people using this service are usually stressed to get to a plane on time or knackered from a long journey home , the drivers and staff on the phone could be more precise .
F	i find them to be first_rate , not only for the plants but all the other products they sell too .
F	your selection of toys / games / puzzles is absolutely great and looking through your catalogue i ordered about 0 items and would know that next year , i would probably be able to find the same amount again .
M	their prices match th best in the market .
M	welldone machine_mart !
M	in fact i chased after 0_weeks and got a one - line reply ( automated ?)
M	however , full_marks to the one respondent .
F	after ordering i revue bed a call from a representative confirming order and delivery details .
F	it was a next_day service so they picked_up and then delivered the next_day as expected .
F	if i had known this at the time i could have purchased elsewhere .
M	i had over 0000 official vintage cd singles and went to the trouble of typing every barcode in for ziffit - it took a day and a half .
F	i used their very easy website to book my cleaner 00 days in_advance and almost_immediately , received confirmation from them .
M	its just as totally dissapointing as the obismal auto service you get for the first 00_minutes of the call .
M	slowest queues in the world at food stall and to get tickets , even to collect your prebooked .
M	the delivery was faster_than i anticipated .
F	easy ordering process and good communications .
M	recieved e_mail from viagogo to say that al is well and that i shall recieve the tickets soon . recieved another email to say that tickets were being hand delivered today by 0pm so i took the day off work to make_sure i recieved them .
F	sufficient to put me off re - ordering .
F	my item was replaced again , this time to be greeted with a driver with the attitude of a pubescent 00 year_old male .
M	although the products are great and i constantly got messages updating me on the order i placed , i feel as though the delivery has let the whole_experience down somewhat .
F	wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else .
M	well made , reliable so_far ( fitted for about 0 months ).
F	they also ask you to bring back the car empty , and the price charged for fuel is above normal .
F	my advice , if you want next_day delivery for a weekend , don_'_t use woolovers !!!
F	this was spotted straight_away so we called the customer service team to see if we could get this changed for a week_later .
F	you almost lost my business .
F	fantastic service , excellent product .
M	i chose the complete lens package and assumed it would take much longer to arrive .
F	it really means all_inclusive , drinks as well ( perhaps not alcohol , but we don_’_t drink alcohol anyway ), and hot food is served in one restaurant or another almost all day long .
M	do not use parcel_force please
M	go to spex0less . com .
F	great company great service very quick delivery .
F	once ordered my invitations & envelopes arrived within a few_days .
M	not the first time that i have used these_guys .
F	?
F	love the product , but was slightly_disappointed with the shipping time , as it was for a christmas_present and i '_d ordered it well in_advance , but ended_up hoping it would arrive in time to wrap up .
F	told the delivery slot in plenty of time and appreciated the phone_call 00_minutes beforehand however how on earth you are supposed to unpack the furniture from the boxes without_damaging the box ( box must be kept in_tact to return any faulty items if not guarantee void ).
M	there were small flying things and crawlers and i thought the mini fortefog would do the trick .
F	i would happily use them again and most certainly will do in the not too_distant_future .
M	contacted mercedes uk , who said yes , the dealer was correct the brakes are not covered by the warranty , even for a malfunction , as they are a " wearing part ".
M	they have competitive_prices and despatch and delivery has always been really prompt .
F	i rewrote my review removing the " offensive and coarse " word , which was only a slang and every day word for cigarettes , commonly used in the uk and not deemed in any way offensive .
M	?
F	i always use envirofone , and has done numerous_times , as they always give you the price that they quote .
M	however , i got no response to my request for a return mailing address .
F	monday came and no sign of the parcel .
F	will use ' ' webuybooks ' again .
M	as well as this you could only record the talktalk channels and not the usual digital channels , each months bill was massively over priced what we expected and if you paused something and came back an_hour later it would just skip back to the live playing .
F	if the website wasn_'_t covered in customer testimonies saying how quick delivery was , i might have noticed the small_print about possible delivery time - but over three_weeks from intial order is ridiculous for one t - shirt .
M	obviously this interparcel is a unwise choice , the advisor i spoke to sam , managed to refund me .
F	terrible company , i was promised on upgrade a price that was very reasonable so accepted .
F	i ordered some flowers and a baby_boy balloon as a surprise for my sister who had given birth to my nephew .
M	i paid 000reg to renew the domain , but they failed to pay the registry so the domain was lost .
M	i would recommend to everyone looking for oakley glasses .
F	otherwise though , i was pleased with the general appearance of the invitations and delivery etc was all very satisfactory .
M	excellent service and i wouldn_'_t hesitate to recommend thesignbuilder . co . uk
M	flowers arrived on time and in good condiotn .
F	so he knows !.
M	further , the pricing was extremely competitive , comparable to any of the premium sites that i have used in the past .
M	while the order process and order status feedback was great unfortunately the automated_responses were not quite fitting for a funeral .
M	i will surely use you again
M	the product looks ok ( can '_t really comment until delivered ), but the website was way too slow and i almost gave up on several_occasions .
M	there were plenty of tyre options and the price was good .
M	annoyingly , 0 out of the last 0 items i ordered , ( hestre ski_gloves and a salomon origins air ski_helmet ), despite_being shown as in stock in the size / colour i required , turned_out not to be , and they refunded the payments .
F	as far as the flowers are concerned i was disappointed in the size of the bunch .
M	they changed my flight time twice by half an_hour so we had to change our transfers which was non - refundable .
M	it wasn_'_t until i rode the bike that weekend that i discovered that the gears had been poorly adjusted , the gears , chain and rear_mech hadn_'_t been lubricated .
M	and despite the fact that i know he had my number to call me back - he didn_'_t do so .
M	shame as there are probably a few good entrepreneurs around but this experience has made me think_twice and i tend to get better value and less hassle sticking to the bigger_players now .
F	since i live in sweden i was prepared that the shipping would take about 00 days but i got my delivery only 0_days after my purchase !
F	rescheduling is a nightmare !
F	the book was in excellent condition and shipping was pretty fast
F	we are very impressed with the most excellent service you have provided .
M	the actual service has_been good so_far but getting there was a pain to say the least .
F	terrible experience would never recommend or use again
F	a wee_bit more_expensive but they use royal_mail .
F	had quite a time with my recent yodel delivery .
M	the procedure was quick and easy and i was informed via_sms of the arrangements and phone personally when to expect the engineer .
M	all the best !
M	took no time at all to place an order and it was despatched and arrived all within a week .
F	one definitely cheered up gran !
F	my latest experience takes the biscuit .
M	bought tickets , was contacted and confirmed via_email .
M	therefore , the obvious questions , as woman between 00 - 00 very rarely join such sites , in what way is the service fit for purpose ?
M	a big thank_you to them all .
M	as you have no option but to pay for a seat , surely it should be impossible to book a flight without booking a seat .
M	i placed an order for 000ml_bottle of blue statos in august cost £ 0 . 00
F	i had laser_eye treatment , it is such a difference being_able to see so clear .
M	very slow to respond .
F	it would '_ve been nice to know that it would be late .
F	is there free wi_-_fi ?
M	initial no_hassle booking at fairly short_notice .
F	( even with white shoes / boots underneath these ' covers ' would have looked ' tacky ' and spoilt the look of the outfit - i chose to wear my own cream suede boots which looked just as good .)
M	you have to cancel , get a refund and order again !!
F	easytobook . com just sent us from one non_existent booking to another .
M	tyreshopper is my first_port of call for tyres .
M	have bought different_types of glasses .
F	i have ordered several items from animed_direct and they have a most efficient and rapid service in completing my orders
F	so i dont have agood thing to say about them 00 --- 00s are a nice sound but i took them of and slung them away sorry 0 bad feedback dave
F	beautiful bag .
M	another convenient store that repeatedly fails on stock_levels , partly_because the way they store stuff means if they say they have 00 in stock , 00 are probably broken / missing / on a pallet somewhere_else .
F	i called them and told them about the issue , they suggested a factory restart so i went through and backedup all the images and data on my phone and they agreed to call me back the next_day - i did not receive any phone_calls from them .
M	i was delighted with the service and now i am aware of the flexibility and support given when ordering from the store i will_certainly be using the service in the future .
M	despite me making this arrangement they have continued to mail and text me requesting the full_amount and have now threatened court_action to retrieve the money and have outlined the extra_charges i can expect to pay should this go to court .
M	!
F	this situation is still on - going and i still hope that it will be rectified satisfactorily some time before the year is out .
F	unfortunately booked it in the morning and realised by the afternoon my trip plans had changed and i had to cancel the entire booking .
F	and boat_cruise excellent .
F	order arrived very quickly and i was very happy with items
M	next_day am delivery , great correspondance and service .
F	the prices are competative , however the site is not the easiest to use .
F	we chose house_network after viewing a property they were marketing as we found them cery helpful .
F	my transaction_id is 0000000 and if i could get an actual_human response that would be a bonus too !
F	i then find out that i have to pay the return postage which cost me £ 0 . 00 !.
M	the cs is terrible as they seems like you bother them as a customer who try to figure_out why the promises aren_'_t kept !
M	over £_00 orders are delivery free , which can make smaller orders a little expensive .
F	very good service quick delivery would use again
M	from the moment i orders it felt_like i have walked_into a shop , chose the flowers myself and delivered them .
M	booked a subcompact citroen ds0 through sicily_by car_rental to pick_up from bergamo airport .

M	on my first order i receive it with no trouble .
F	i was very pleased with the value offered for my phone , it was higher the trade in price of all mobile phone retailers i '_d checked with .
M	some of the places that are reviewed such as restaurants have photos of different places which are obviously in the place . some are closed_down and do not exist and in other cases i have been let_down by reviews .
M	interlink delivery service also excellent and accurate with timed delivery .
F	this company should have delivered a rabbit hutch to me yesterday and didn_'_t despite me leaving a note when i had to go to school saying that a neighbour would sign .

F	i was given a price , sent the phone on the monday and had a cheque in my hand by thursday .
M	ordered many_times from pet_supermarket , mostly large bags of dog_food .

F	good cust service informed every_step if the way .
F	my decision to order was based on the value for money
M	upon doing some_research over the internet i have found out that they have known about compatability issues with certain website '_s but have chose to ignore it for years , in some cases !!
M	it arrived next_day .
M	damaged drawers on delivery - after sending 0 0 separate incorrect drawers out in very poor packaging , it is still not resolved .
F	tracking service updating you on your package was excellent , and very helpful .
F	unlock my phone !
M	i rang and rang and i missed the window because my phone outright refused to connect the call .
M	insurance was overpriced , found cheaper immediately elsewhere .
M	these_idiots are the nasty people that get hold of your mobile number illegally and text you at all hours of the night and day pestering you about ppi , but dont reply because firstly it will cost you each time you do , and once you reply ( even stop to try and stop it ), they then know that your number works and they will_continue to bombard you and sell on your number to other rogue illegal outfits
M	service fine item fine but to charge £ 0 . 00 +£ 0 to deliver a package to this value / weight has left me adamant i would never use you again .

F	i emailed again to advise i had received the item but was disappointed with the lack of communication from the company and to give them an opportunity to respond to my concerns before i put a rating on the website . no overly_impressed , and no offer of a reimbursement of the additional_charge i paid for the quick delivery .
M	i thought to myself , i do not need an insurance .
F	very friendly and knowledgeable .
F	he then arrived at my work when he said ( which nowadays is a rarity !)
M	very good value for money just allow a bit of time for them to turn_up at home thay took longer_than i was inspeted

F	all was well till i received an_email_stating “ the engineers have tested your phone and have found that your phone has a scratches on the unit and on camera lens and phone is network locked to o0 ”

M	used your service to order flowers firstly the site wasn_'_t up to date with the credit_card_details input only running to 0000 but then i made mistake of presuming that the order date was set for the same day , i could have phoned one of a dozen shops befor twelve and got flowers there the same day .
M	without paying a high price to call sky , which many people are unprepared to do , it is very hard to get in touch with sky unless you ' re happy to deal with a non uk_based centre ( which i '_m not ).

M	my wife enquired_about talk talks deal on their phone , internet and tv packages for her farther , the sales girl quoted free for the first three_months ( payment of line rental only ) and if they signed_up today the cost after 0 months would be £_00 . 00 including line rental and they would provide an engineer free of charge .
M	i have recently spent a not unsubstantial amount of money on a pair of ray_ban from here , i would normally go to a shop to try on but the on line reviews of this company were favourable .

F	grandma loved them !
M	after sales service not too great .

M	even ebay realizes there are scammers about !
M	but the shipping company driver was an unhelpful person .
F	my experience with oak_furniture_land was on the whole very good .
F	i enjoy facebook but don_'_t understand many things that go on such as people wanted me to be added to ' birthdays ' etc .
M	i have run memory tests on the individual units and identified that one is faulty .
F	i '_ve bought four different machines from them and i '_ve never been disappointed .
F	there was no communication of this , they just credited my account and sent the stock they had .
F	apparantly because he didn_'_t untick the box on the checkout page , they have been able to dip their hands into our bank_account each_month .
F	awful that they are allowed to continue trading and awful that skyscanner continues to include them in searches !
F	after a promise that my money would be with me the next_day after i had updated my review , i received nothing .

M	we have always been delighted with serenatas service and will not let this colour our judgement , and although my wife was disappointed we hope that this was just a ' one - off !'

M	they said it was an issue they were aware of and it was being worked on , but the first person i spoke to clearly wasn_'_t aware of it .
F	it is helpful being_able to order online as i have severe_arthritis and often cannot leave the house to access shops so this service is a great boon .
M	very prompt and efficient once order processed though .
M	fantastic service .
F	the estimated delivery date was friday 0th_october , which is today .
M	its free and if you do your shopping online makes_sense to get something back for your cash .
F	i ordered a beko double_oven for which i paid for next_day delivery .
M	cool for cats man .
M	i have used other web_hosting_companies in the past , and the resolution of issues has not been as prompt as i have found with 000 - reg
M	yes its wednesday so 0 full working_days since my order but as tilting brackets for 00 " tv '_s usually go for around £_000 . who_cares ?

M	delivery was prompt .
F	absolutely_stunning service from an internet company .

F	will use the service again when we '_ve worked our way through the 00 bottles .
F	im a bit disappointed .
F	was very pleased to see they came with matching holders as well !
F	luckily we found the same tv_unit on another website under a different name , which we now have and it too looks great .
F	whenever i place an order i know it '_s going to be delivered within a few_days - no long delays .
M	so they have the monopoly on it , but sorry guys the internets here .
F	we told the guy but he wasn_'_t bothered .
M	0st_class clothes & 0st_class service !
M	simply_hike were a pleasure to use , easy to use website , ordered the bits i needed and immediately received an e_- mail_confirming the order , as the order went through simply_hike kept me informed of what stage we were at and where the items were in the dispatch process .
F	in this email , they claimed .
F	with hindsight , i should have bought 0 tesco_finest bunches and would have had a far more impressive bouquet to hand over at the special_occasion .
M	and to be fair it offered more than its competitors .
F	but would have liked it to be an inch or so narrower .
M	well impressed .
F	i think i '_ll use somewhere with faster shipping and pay the extra next time .
F	customer service can be friendly and helpful at times , but in the last few_months has tended to be abrupt and unwelcoming .
M	it was before parcel0go and insurance we '_ll see - not much hope .
F	ffx offered a really good service even over the easter_weekend .
M	lets_see what sort of response , appology , recompense , good old_fashioned customer service i get because at present it looks highly unlikely !
F	fat lot of good that is .
M	good communications via e_- mail and on the phone .
F	i '_m proud to be a customer and will tell all my friends and family about protect your bubble .
M	ordering_process was smooth and delivery estimate very acurate .
F	sadly had 0 small_dent on but as it wasn_'_t unwrapped within a week as our joiner wasn_'_t ready to put it on the kitchen , we had no come_back .
F	i am doing full bathroom renovation and going on holiday at the end of august so could not wait on the basin coming into stock as i had to arrange plumber etc and it wouldn_'_t leave me enough time to complete before holiday
F	after sitting there
M	i saved over £_00 compared to purchasing the exact_same shoe through my local specialist running shop .
F	even their sales_staff agreed and apologised that the description confused me but told me i should have called them to clarify .
M	good email communication but would have been better to know it was out of stock before purchasing the item .
M	same tyres , same town , same street but £_00 . 00 cheaper !
M	they kept on delaying my scheduled days .
M	i purchased the north_face bionics apex jacket and love it .
F	the pc is great looking and from my son really good spec .
F	i '_m very pleased with the products received .
M	first we were told it was cancelled and we would be contacted .
F	rubbish service rubbish company keep well away from them !
F	honestly , it was all a little ridiculous - several pages of what i was responsible for and what they were not .
M	however , when you select which date and am or pm you want to have your tyres_fitted there is no certainty that this will be achieved . the tyre_fitter in my case , i selected to fit the tyres in the morning but they did not have them in stock , so i had to wait for the delivery of tyres which ended_up being in the afternoon .
M	great to be able to order fantastic deals but when the sizes of the clothes are terribly poor , the items have to be returned using royal_mail and no clear and easy process .
F	would definitely recommend the furniture_market and buy from them again .
F	the woman on the other end of the phone took_ages to understand what i wanted to do because she clearly did not speak_english and she then preceeded tospell the name change incorrectly .
M	they arrived quickly in the post and were well_packed .
M	pixmania should ' make good ' when they send out the wrong items .
F	their customer service is an_absolute_disgrace and are totally_incompetent !
M	the racket was late being delivered to pdh from prince - good communication_throughout .
M	and when you proud of your car lightning lets you keep on top of it , even when it gets dusty waterless lightning will make it shine in minutes , even your window plastic trims and of course your crome , so you are never bothered if the polish over spays on other parts of your car .

F	cooking food in bulk and leving it around for ages .
F	what can i say started the process on tuesday_lunchtime , by 00am friday i had received my vouchers !
F	having tried various mechanical ones , which frothed cold milk , i decided to upgrade to heated and frothed .
F	it was finally sorted on a friday_morning and the vet promised the painkillers would be posted 0st_class that day as it was so urgent - he said if it was sent by courier it wouldn_'_t be delivered until the following_tuesday as monday was the may bank_holiday .
F	tried to pay off balance on card 0_weeks_ago and still trying while the interest just adds_up .
M	unlike the more strictly controlled british bacon .
M	my first contact was via the " advice " facility , available at a button click on the website .
M	they stock some really nice & unique products and they remain as one of my favourite online stationary suppliers .
M	so yes their grips are good quality and yes it arrived eventually so that makes it a 0_star experience now .
M	ordered a big_boy bean_bag on 0th_november_0000 .
M	my order was processed very quickly and i received regular status_updates by email .
M	the " crack " on the bezel is perfect and straight , looks_like the intended " crack " on the iphone 0 ( see the antenna configuration ).
F	ordered epiphone ukulele and belcat 00w slim amp on monday and tracked until thursday when they said that they had tried to deliver but they hadn_'_t so after several phone_calls to yodel they managed to phone their driver who was in next village so arranged to meet at coop to pick_up package ( never really wanted to be a courier ) his excuse was that his sat_nav sent him wrong . any way product is good although it came without pick guard and amp was not slim one as ordered ( but not worried_about this .) i would recommend this firm as i think courier was at fault .
M	buying was simple enough and we '_ll see whether or not the flowers arrive .
F	my wife had to take a sudden flight to ireland for a family emergency and we inadvertantly booked for july and not june , but the driver took the car ok .
M	office_furniture online '_s ( ofo ) problem is that they have contracted with city_link as a delivery partner .
F	would think_twice before ordering again .
M	would be perfectly happy to recommend to friends and family .
M	thanks
F	with excellent , polite and considerate service from every member of staff involved .
F	!

M	but the really most frustrating thing was the guitar being reduced by £_000 the very next_day - grrrrrrrrrr !
F	so quick and easy . will_definately do it again .
M	why - because you have to get on a bus to a depot beside one of the long_term car_parks .
M	bt has_been grossly incompetent in trying to deal with technical_issues with a broadband_connection , with a technical_team based overseas that had no idea of how to fix things but would promise you the earth !

F	the service was good but the item was not at all like the photo on the website !
M	the corner store chap_who i dropped them off with was understandabley a little_weary as he only has a small shop and little storage_space .
F	for eternity for this .
M	worse still 0_weeks_later ( today '_s date is 00 / 00 / 00 ) the issue has not been resolved & i have received no refund or compensation !!!
F	i chose the diamond pendent that you have to thread the necklace through the bail , so the diamond was the only feature .
M	i '_ve_used their services for a few_years_now and can '_t fault them .
F	great staff
F	i still cant quite believe_how quickly it arrived at my door .
F	strange phenomenon because the money left my bank_account the day i placed the order .
F	so sorry ebookers - need to drastically improve your customer service
F	ok but doesn_'_t quite live up to what you wpuld hope for .
F	the member of staff who i dealt_with in store was steph jones , who was the only saving_grace in the whole matter .
F	a few_days_later , the same thing happened again .
F	booked through interparcel and citylink was due to collect .
M	without_any hint of unbiassedness , hughes_direct deserves my 0_star_rating as i was quite pleased and impressed with the service they provided , unbeaten price they hold and how they handled all the issues i had which i believe is a very good standard for customer service .
F	will_definetely use them again .
F	i found this project reasonably easy to carry out .
F	very comfy .
M	tiny_bit_annoying .
F	therefore rugs / lining all the way up the stairs would be appropriate in wet circumstances . hummm not sure how the hell that would work but anyway , as i said dry day for me so luck was in .
M	two_days after expected delivery date and finally get an e_- mail asking me to call them .
F	ok , no problem , someone would look at my damaged photos and get back to me that day ( tuesday )… by 0 pm id still not heard a whisper , so i called again wednesday to be told someone would get back to me that day … sure enough by 0pm id had an e_mail yippee !.
F	how are we supposed to experience glaswegian nightlife if we have to catch a train back before 00 . 00pm ?

M	edit_: the other two blinds arrived with no_problems .
F	good price but cannot wait a week for first_aid bits .
F	questioned if it was genuine due to poor quality of bottle .
M	love the text_alert and automated_message with a 00 hr warning but not getting an am or pm or a date is not great when you won_'_t be in .
F	i did this within an_hour of them responding to me and it is now the 00nd nov and i have had nothing back from them .
M	expedia tend to give you a hotel_room without breakfast etc where

M	packed well and in perfect_condition .
M	when i first considered trying to improve on the very poor savings rates currently on offer , bearing in mind that as a retired person i am largely dependent on savings income , i was surprised to note the possible benefits of peer to peer_lending .
M	i was offered a fantastic selection at even better prices .
F	i didnt_realise these werent hp branded cartridges , they were generic ones .
F	needless to say it didn_'_t come through in time , and upon_checking the website it was out of stock .
F	they won_'_t let you board early with a young_child unless you have paid_extra and even if you have the right baggage weight_limit , they won_'_t let you board if it isn_'_t split between the right number of bags !
M	he delivered everything with total truth and honesty and went out of his way to explain all the facts .
F	yodel are quick enough to check these reviews , but not quick enough to sort_out any complaints or issues they cause !
F	they even make the total of your goods show up in red so that '_s all you see .
F	highly_recommend the whole service we recieved !
M	but i shall live in hope .
F	the exante_diet is far more varied and much_easier than the cambridge_diet and a lot_cheaper .
M	where '_s my stuff ?
F	ordered these flowers for a special birthday , delivery was spot_on but the flowers were terrible .
F	would really recommend this company
M	the card was miswritten - all the romance was lost when " to my lobster " ( friends series 0 , episode 00 ) was written as " to my brother "!
F	the website was easy to use too .
M	i purchased 0 x fans .
F	i would recommend maxuma , they were brilliant in dealing_with the sale of my phone .
M	i hope this was just a one off
M	it is a shared desk with several other_companies like dollar and thrifty whose signs are far more prominent than sbyc .
M	my only critique would be the 00 day wait for food after ordering but all it takes is a little planning in advance and there is no negative to musclefood !
F	fast delivery and great prices .
M	they said they would send one out straight_away .
F	two_days_later i have still had no contact from anyone .
F	so in summary , i have received a ridiculously_cheap price for my phone nowhere_near the quote i agreed to and through no fault of my own have no option to get my phone back and have to just accept this .
F	have used pet_supermarket a number of times .
F	unfortunately the box was damaged ( 0 " hole in the side ) but the machine was ok . re the machine : love the one stage buttonholer , and it is so much_lighter to handle then my old one - altogether very pleased with my purchase .
F	i received a " large " bouquet through the post for my birthday from my husband .
M	i use rentalcars a lot - as i rent a car somewhere ( mostly in europe ) almost every week .
F	postage 0 . 00 petrol 0 . 00 phone_calls - a very expensive parcel x
M	only got here in 0 days , and was extremely well_packaged .
M	the depot manager at shrewsbury has_been investigating further and we have discovered that there has_been an it issue , resulting in your consignments not being allocated to their depot for collection .
F	with the cheaper guarantee , you are not missing out on savings from going to other stores , and they regularly have ' spend over_£_00 and get £ 0 off your next shop ' when you next spend over_£_00 .
M	why does the company have phone lines that either get cut_off or never answered ?
F	very impressed indeed .
F	i will certainly use again and have recommended to other '_s .
F	i found there my favourite product - it '_s not on sale in any of the shops in my town .
M	have used nature '_s best for a couple of years and they ' re generally pretty good .
F	fashioneyewear dealt promptly and professionally with my order , including handy updates on progress .
F	price was very good as well .
F	but the ordering process was a nightmare as i got thrown off the pages so many_times and had to re - enter the same information time and time again .
F	this order came the next_day which was brilliant .
M	the uploading of the prescriptions and the ability to be able to see past purchases and the brilliant email reminders you get when the time comes to have a repeat_prescription is very handy indeed .
F	any_queries_answered quickly and knowledgeably - great deals with all offers honoured and many savings made .
M	however , i raised again the issue of the marks on the paintwork .
F	would be better if you could book seats together .
M	they seriously need to look in to how they can improve their ordering system as it '_s quite disgusting paying £ 0 . 00 for delivery of a parcel with at_least 00_% of it '_s expected contents missing .
M	i also bought a ‘ new ’ electric_guitar alongside the drum_kit order , only for this to arrive as well in a sorry state – packaging badly_damaged , deep_scratches to the guitar and parts absent .
F	delivery came on right day and was well_packaged and seemed fresh .
M	i know this company has defrauded me out of £_00 . 00 and will never ever trade with them again .
M	great deal , quick delivery .
M	we purchaced 0 tickets at twice the market value from viagogo , not problem we knew what the prices were before we bought them , only to find when we arrived the tickets were not valid due to duplication and we had to buy three more ticket to gain_entry to strickley come dancing on sat ( 00 . 00 . 00 ) the ticket supplier can not be trusted in the words of nia security , there was at_least 0 other people with the same tickets , alway buy from a secure sourse 0 tickets have cost us 000 + , we spoke viagogo on sunday who were not interest , we have sent e , mail and copies of e , mail from security of the nia still no reponce shocking
M	and the driver found his way round to my back garden and carried the shed panels to exactly the right spot .
M	the typography is perfect - a lot of your competitors don_'_t get the spacing right but you could not have done better .
F	i waited a couple more days and still didn_'_t receive my package , i called again and they said fedex should have contacted me and i should contact fedex if not .
F	and the fact that you can track the parcel is an extra re - assurance plus now the add - on of a txt to keep you up to date is forward thinking .
F	yhe quality of all items orderd was first_class .
M	although i am unhappy with the process i had to endure their complaints team are 0_star .
F	unlike similar_sites that knock money off after they have your phone and there '_s nothing you can do about .
M	kind_regards , paul .
F	i chose the screw earrings as i didn_'_t want to lose them if the butterfly came off .
M	i wish they really did " record their calls " that way they couldn_'_t blatantly deny all responsibility for saying things they later deny .
M	i made my selection , booked the most suitable day for me , sat back and relaxed .
M	absolutely_useless .
F	product is fab , delivery not good !
F	i think something needs to be done about this as other insurance companies offer is .
M	the worktops were then delivered on time , had been carefully_packaged and the delivery team were very careful when they bought them into the house .
M	booked online so that was all hassle_free .
F	spoilt the whole wowcher experience for me . as the saying goes once bitten .
M	where has the high_quality service with a smile dissapeared to .
M	my son looked up the best price for his iphone_0s and this company came top .
M	i also bought two items at prices i couldnt get anywhere_else .
M	i am always disappointed at the delivery times .
M	overall i believe amazon won with their customer service as well as providing by enlarge lower prices .
F	!
F	smashed the likes of interflora off the planet .
F	good price / fast fast delivery / all good .
F	the only_negative i would say is that i found it difficult on their website to find information on receiving credit for dvds sold to them via voucher .
M	couldn_'_t download prescription as download memory not large enough , had to email and attach the prescription , then post the original .
M	i '_ve seldom come_across such incompetence and definitely could not recommend them .
F	it is now 00th_feb , and still no sign of my ' express delivery '.
F	flowers are beautiful .
M	0 days_later they arrived .
M	herbies was everything i could have asked for .
M	of course , the faulty appliance isn_'_t down to kitchen_appliances , who turned the order around efficiently .
M	note i have not used defamatory statements about the company or anyone in it and all of my comments were fair , balanced and factual given the information i had at the time each was made .
M	to top that off , the dispatch and subsequent delivery was mega swift so 00 / 00 all_round .
F	excellent quality and service .
F	i complained and amazon sent dpd and picked it up first time when scheduled !
M	they could have easily tried to sell me a new tyre but happily repaired the puncture without_hesitation .
F	easy ordering and turned_up when they were supposed to .
F	will not go_anywhere_else and would definately recommend to everyone .
F	are vf contravening my human rights ?
M	the items that i traded are worth far more than what was offered , but as zapper trades in such high volumes it is able to offer such minimal amounts .
M	totally_unacceptable !
F	disappointed that it '_s not easy to organise a return
M	excelent product , well priced and a first_class service
M	i like the items on offer but i don_'_t think i '_ll be purchasing any more because of the reason stated above .
F	the tracking_information was updated further on the same day and stated that we were not in and a call card had been left .
F	costumes came the day after order and they were just as_described !
M	i have been using ftt on a monthly_basis for 0 years and they have never put a foot wrong .
M	this is not good enough and not the service i would expect .
F	thankfully i have now managed to remove them but i '_m very dissapointed that it arrived in this state when i '_ve paid £_00 for the coat .
F	i have used eflorest many_times their flowers have always arrived on time .
M	i was looking for a bush craft knife on the web and i came_across uttings site by pure_chance , its easy to use , i ordered what i wanted , no_problems , fast delivery , what more could you ask for , brilliant .
M	the main bathroom is damp & smells musty , the jacuzzi bath , one of the selling points of the villa , doesn_'_t work !
F	so they were embarrassed , i was ditto , and none of us appreciated your efforts at making a same day delivery .
F	- further update -
M	would recommend these_guys and ill be back to shop with them
F	today '_s excuse is that they have been unable to fulfil my order due to demand .
F	the delivery was really quick and the prices were excellent .
M	the automated service is far from helpful .
M	shuttle_bus was regular .
F	i also wasn_'_t sent a statement through post or email_telling_me when my payment was due so i missed this payment and was charged a £_00 administration_fee and was also charged a late fee of £ 0 . 00 for returning items late which i asked them repeatedly to take off my account .
F	i decided not to spend my money there !
F	i found their whole manner very rude and will never use them again .
F	damaged paintwork .
M	see_above : that '_s all there is to say .
F	they have brought some style to our cornish village home .
F	now , this not being a floor that came with the summerhouse .
F	the flowers were lovely according to my mother in law , however the arrangement was small for the price .
F	i bought three lamp shades which were true to the colour depicted on the internet .
F	the invoice and the delivery note clearly_stated it was white .
F	great service .
M	but thank_you for putting bread back on my plate
M	no refund yet .
M	lol this company is nothing more than a joke .
F	it was sent first_class by royal_mail but it took 0_days to be delivered after i received the e_- mail_stating it had been dispatched .
F	i will certainly not be dealing_with worldstores again
M	they were very quick in paying and didn_'_t mess_around with the amount they originally offered
M	all went well , but tickets priced at more than double gate price .
F	i have never_experienced worse customer service than with three uk .
F	shopping with " chemist_direct is easy but what i think is a bit_pricey is the postage ,
F	i could not be_happier with the banner i designed on domandgeri '_s website .
M	i can '_t say who the fault lies with ( probably not with animed '_s dispatch in fairness ) but a budget delivery company gives budget results .
M	then again it '_s no surprise that with such a crappy service .
M	even the low_cost supermarkets who are clear its price and not service don_'_t put anyone with such limited social skills loose on the public .
F	in addition , we were told the fitting of our wardrobes would take place around 0 - 0_weeks after the designer had come out and contracts were signed but it is currently 0_weeks since this happened and we have an installation date in a further 0_weeks time - assuming that they will show up of course !
M	what a bunch of liars .
M	therefore , i go on facebook only when i am called , am unimpressed each time , and i log off asap .
F	the contact_lenses are so comfortable and reasonably_priced .
F	rubbersole is the best online store i have ever used .
F	funny how she didn_'_t hear the doorbell when she was on the phone to me at the time .
M	recomendo e futuramente espero não_ter os mesmos problemas com a entrega .
F	would recommend this company to anyone
F	usually the money is even deposited the same day as the transaction has started .
M	the remote arrived very quickly , with a battery already installed , and the programming took ten seconds .
M	one of the screws on my recent order was worn .
M	the only attendant left the car_park in the mini_bus .???
M	excellent service .
F	it looks fantastic and the quality is amazing .
F	however , on this occasion i was a little disappointed , i ordered a christmas arrangement to be sent to a friend who had just had a heart_attack , paying £_00 . 00 , and seeing online thought it would be a reasonable size .
F	the helmet we ordered was well priced and dispatched within a reasonable time_scale and received in perfect_condition .
F	provides amazing support post fractured fib
F	!
F	kloe @ imvu .
M	if i behaved like this with my clients i ' d be out of a job .
F	so sometimes hostelworld is a necessary tool , but the booking_fees and limited feedback allowed are lame .
F	the wrong medication was sent out from the prescription .
F	it was very easy to book through the online site .
F	have tried_ringing and you go round in circles , you cannot get to speak to a person !!
F	when i was mailing them about day of possible delivery , i got answer within few hours with tracking_number of my order . 000_% happy .
F	ordered a chiminea for a birthday_present from this company on the 0 june_0000 , had a choice to select a delivery day so chose friday 0 june .

M	the clerk told me there was a .
F	as for paying for fastrack through security - worth_every_penny - especially if travelling with young_children !
F	we had a problem with 0 of the items - the 0 tone bloack & the jingle stick .
F	what they are doing with their arbitary acceptance process , and non return of goods amounts to thef .
F	i realised that not all the flowers would be the same as the picture on the website , but nothing was the same not even the all the colours .
M	about arrival was excellent including from call from delivery men .
F	part of what i did receive was damaged due to poor packing .
F	i wasn_'_t impressed with blue_chip holiday '_s booking procedures .
F	having said all that , i would have no reservation , whatsoever , in recommending your company !
F	i will_continue to order but may leave a longer time for expected del .
F	this was a very unpleasant and embarrassing experience and i am most upset that i was ripped_off .
M	if the rest of the reviews are anything to go by i can kiss my parcel goodbye !
M	i will recommend this to anyone who needs good meats / supplements and i will_defo be back soon !
F	however 0_days_later i received an_email which told me the item was out of stock and no new stock would be coming in so i would have my money refunded .
F	everything is done for the customer - all you have to do is put in an on line request and without_any fuss the medications arrive at your door within a day usually .
M	wrote and sent copy of credit ratiing just to prove a point .
M	just not very well sign posted and we ended_up spending about 00_minutes driving round in circles trying to find it !
F	the guy they sent to have a look was an ex - bosch staff_member and knew the machine inside and out .
F	most of all your queues after 00pm with only one check - out operator working ( edinburgh jewel )
F	secondly why on earth would they think it '_s acceptable to destroy tickets after three failed deliveries ?
M	this was despite someone specifically being there waiting for them .
M	if you have not heard of the steam sale get on it !
M	found bravofly after_searching with kayak who directed me there .
M	a few difficulties trying to get some of the barrel nut fixings to engage properly but otherwise no_problems .

M	having been with quantum about 00 months now we have many happy customers .
M	we had a couple of pieces damaged but the customer service
F	reply : if it can be left with a neighbour i could text to let driver know .
M	now olotels have left it 00 days when this could have been sorted in 0 phone_call .
M	a huge list of consumer complaint comments about wae removed yet again .
M	the phone was ' in stock ' a day later but was £_00 more_expensive !
M	warning do not use this company they took £_000 from me and never sent my order
F	got the bed and mattresses , better quality with 00yr guarantee from ikea at just over half the cost of this place .
M	i would recommend them .
M	luckily for me i didn_'_t post the keys in the box first otherwise i wouldn_'_t have known what to do with the gps sat_nav as all the other rental car agents were closed at that time in the morning .
M	glasses arrived in good time and are good quality .
F	won_'_t be using again unfortunately .
M	excellent delivery service .
M	i '_ve enjoyed over a year of great gaming as a result of my cryo nano .
M	i have read some of the reviews from disappointed people and am amazed .
F	i was pleasantly_surprised that despite only placing the order in the afternoon , the item ( xmas_tree ) was delivered the following_day .
M	the day we were due to pick_up the car the guy dealing_with us was off ill , they had no idea we were even coming so had to wait while someone went off to find then clean the car in a hurry , must have taken over an_hour .
F	my order took over a week to arrive although i did receive an explanation and apology so i '_m not concerned .
M	the girl on the end of the phone was very apologetic and stressed that it would be delivered the following_day and that even_though i had given them over a weeks notice for the delivery date they had just failed to complete the paperwork .
M	i attended and gave my keys to a man who looked round the car for damage .
M	working
M	my only_gripe was the site said if you order before a certain time it would be posted out the same day , i ordered before said time but it took 0 days to arrive , it wasn_'_t the postal service as i didn_'_t get a despatch_notification for 00_hours after ordering .
M	:-)
F	delighted with the shoes and the price , delivery was so quick .
F	great service up to the point of delivery .
M	as a regular used of mail order , i was very happy with outdookit .
M	this came and went , and i called to chase .
F	the free gutter hooks were missing but we didnt need them anyway .
F	package came sooner_than_expected , but the costumes were dirty , stained and poorly packed . yes . i would probably order from this company again .
M	i have had this problem twice with them .
M	excellent work to the whole team , '_ll be back soon .
M	i am really amazed of the choice on amazon .
M	keep_up the good work denney_diving .
M	cant rate lower_than one star sadly
F	would definitely recommend website to use !
F	i bought it for a more_expensive hansgrohe shower_head set as they discontinued this line ( and the one i did find that may have fitted were very expensive ).
F	it now makes the camera complete and the shots are so fast . orca_logic ltd were the cheapest suppliers that i found on the net , the purchase arrived promptly and well_packaged .
M	guess_what signed_up with a cheaper supplier and just before start of supply they objected and cancelled my transfer .
M	on the rare_occasions when there has_been a hiccup , i have always have the best an swiftest response and results .
M	so after 0 minutes on the kwik - fit website i ' d bought the tyres and arranged for the fitting in 0 days time , i got a phone_call from a customer_services lady_who confirmed my details and it was all done .
F	really good product ranges and much_cheaper_than the shops , even with postage taken into account .
F	the only positive thing i have to say about this company is the staff ( when you get to speak to them ) are very polite and helpful , it seems to be more their system that '_s an utter disgrace .
F	we used to shop at tesco perival and then about five years_ago we stated to spend our £_000_+ a week shop went to there hayes middx store and guess_what that store has just becone a cost a lot cafe too .
F	we '_ve had them fitted by a professional kitchen_fitter ( they were very heavy and oak is difficult to cut ), and we '_ve sanded and oiled them 0 times (!)
M	also had a phone_call from the area manager danny rose who_apologised for the bad_experience and said he would be investigating why this happened .
M	easy parking very close to terminal with regular quick bus service .
M	0 rd delivery date to replace faulty items was arranged using another annual_leave date .
F	breakfast was well cooked .- well_done chef !
F	!
F	as the owner of an elderly_dog with specific dietary_needs , the company has saved me a fortune .
M	got great avon_tyres for the price of budget tyres from another supplier !
F	as i was paying for 0 seats , it was worth choosing a budget_airline , but if it was just the two of us , i would prefer to pay a bit more for a bit more comfort and less stress .
F	it '_s not like it '_s a cheap purchase !
F	after_placing my order i was kept up to date with progress by email and received my goods just two_days after ordering - less if you bear in mind i placed my order late in the evening well after normal working hours .
F	i '_d be using it even if there weren_'_t discounts , and there are lots of those .
M	oh_yes and the helmet was cheaper here than anywhere_else by a big margin .
F	we loved our order with optimalprint !
F	my orders have always arrived promptly and in excellent condition .
M	to summarise - a poor mistake a first but an excellent reaction by a company that understood our frustration .
M	following the instructions provided it took less_than 00_minutes to disconnect the pc , fit the extra memory and reconnect the pc .
M	happy customer !
F	i '_d like to know why your company is so incompetent ?
F	sunglasses_shop have really competitive_prices compared to other on - line retailers & free delivery is always a bonus !
M	very good service .
F	sailing to holland was great , made even better by a deal at check in where we paid to upgrade .
M	i am a strong advocate of there own branded tools and machinery and i really wish i lived_closer to one of their branches .
M	you pay for what you get !
F	on return transfers to airport they were nearly an_hour late for first pick_up and 00_mins late for second - no help from phone numbers .
M	customer_services . useless their response we '_ll send it to a shop for you to collect . told them that was unacceptable if i ' d had the time to go to a shop i ' d have gone to a shop .
F	i still hadn_'_t received a reply to my email so 0_days_later i called again this time 0 th in a queue .
F	i ordered the pack , sent my phone away the next_day and the money was in my account within a few_days .
F	then i did it again .
F	" i sincerely apologise for the lack of response from our customer service team .
M	then received and e_- mail saying " we tried to deliver your order from overclockers however there was no one available to sign for the order at the address below ".
M	very poor from a customer service perspective .
F	disgraceful , uncaring set of people .
F	website easy to use , found what i was looking for and it arrived really quickly .
M	!
F	from viewing the website right through the checkout_process , i received perfect service . from checking out , i had regular_emails_informing_me of the status of my order , even one telling_me which hour the next_day my order would be delivered . i would highly_recommend using this company to anyone .
M	at this point steve became pushy and when i told_him to back off he hung_up on me ( i did swear but not at him !).
F	i have logged this with yodel and amazon and obviously amazon will kindly replace but surely to god ( sorry ) any person with a brain wouldnt leave goods on doorstep . apparantly driver to be interviewed grrrrrrrrr i wish i was there cos he or she would get a piece of my mind . a very disruntled customer :-(
F	they also absoutely refused to answer my question about whether the phone should have an instruction_manual with it .
M	just before_christmas 0000 i placed an order for a new bass_guitar , plus an amp and some other assorted bits of kit , and it all arrived on the specified day , at the right time .
M	i was fuming and asked what sort of compensation we could expect because we had nothing to cook on and also had a lodger who would not be able to prepare meals either .
F	not really that cheap anymore
M	we ' re vegetarians and found our choices to be very limited and , a year later , we still find the selection to be too small .
M	as i said , i did not know it was a two year contract as they never mentioned it at all .
F	once they have your money they aren_'_t interested .
F	what more can i ask ?
M	don_’_t use 000reg .
F	the price is very competitive compared to buying on the high_street .
M	they need to make the facts that they ' re hong_kong based and that you '_ll be hit with considerable taxes much more obvious on their site .
M	they were posted the same day and i received them the next .
M	decor was rough .
F	andy the supervisor was called and i asked him how he could justify keeping my money - my problem he said !
M	after sending a email to the ceo and sending copies of complaints letters to them via_recorded delivery we had a visit from a manager , who has agreed to replace 0 window with a new one take out another one and refit correctly and clean off some of the mastic .
M	their price undercut everyone_else by miles .
F	!
F	i went for the buy one get one free offer , however , it should have been 00 . 00 and it comes up at 000_pounds , why , i contacted them through live_chat and they told me that the tyre is free but the fitting is not , i still bought the tyres , even_though i think this should have been made clearer , i am having the tyres_fitted on tuesday , just hoping for a good experience then , will keep you informed .
F	bought a fee things from courses to clothing and haven_'_t been disappointed yet !
M	and given all their orders are sent from us , then there is possibility of custom fraud .
M	this is rather worrying - what if i ever have a real problem ?
F	so every saving i can make counts as i '_m hoping she has a good few_years in her yet .
M	was looking for simple tv remote for my mother in - law .
F	i just hope for a better service next time .
F	you have been warned .
M	the only problem stoping me giving it 0_stars is the machine leaks efluid into mouth quiet often
M	they are now collecting the defective toaster and have agreed to refund , but they are plainly untrustworthy and i would urge that you do not buy from them .
F	however , from what my mother says i feel the flowers were good value , but i was looking for the extra which was promised i . e .
F	0 jan_0000 00 : 00 : 00 am cambridge_cambridgeshire gb out for delivery
M	i had to sent it back the same day the colour is very very bad when i put it on its like re dis not middle / brown plus that i had to pay the post for sending it back i will never order it any more i would not recommend it to my family and friends
M	naturally , i sent an email immediately , highlighting these points and asking for a partial_refund or a smaller partial_refund plus a new back .
M	very good indeed - i bought 0 chests of drawers - beautifully made , proportioned and designed .
M	so not great i '_m afraid !
M	i have bought many replacement heads off other_suppliers without_any_problems .
M	i received the phone quickly the next_day ( no problem there ), but soon realised it wasn_'_t the phone for me .
M	the ic and tv connection kept disconnecting every 00_minutes and caused no end of headaches , plus the callcentres in india do not help .
F	really very pleased with the service and delivery .
F	next_day - aircon not working !!
F	great for businesses that watch there pennies , it does make a big differance .
M	i '_ve only used the service twice and found the turn a round time to get the order processed longer_than_expected .
F	technical details of permanent failure :
F	if you are hesitating stop now , i can guarantee you will now be disappointed with their service so long as you read all the information and reviews .
F	so much steam power that i skipped through my ironing , it made short work of creased jeans and the shape made ironing tiny frills on my grandaughter '_s dresses a breeze .
M	i wonder will i get a reply to this .
M	i spent_nearly_£ 0 , 000 on a new s works frame , handlebars etc and paid for sigma_sport to build the bike using the groupset and wheels from my old bike .
F	i also ordered another and sent it to my brother - he has a watch collection ( mainly expensive ) and i thought a wewood_watch a delightful and interesting addition .
M	if you can even call them a that . no structure .
M	i thought i was a hard phone case when i bought the item , but was disappointed when i discovered it was a sticker that didn_'_t fit the die - cut aperture was not in the right position .
M	i bought a tablet in store with a charger that didn_'_t fit , i bought a blackberry online for a great price then days_later i received an email_telling_me it has_been sold in store so i phoned the store they were not willing to give me the same phone for same price , i went online again and bought another blackberry for an average price when it arrived it is in horrific condition with snapped casing and ah tv charger i think this is wrong i will never shop at cash_generator again and make_sure my family and friens don_'_t .
M	the pickups were delivered a couple of days_later .
M	excellent value for money and great service from the fitting_centre national !
M	great value product delivered next_day delivery which was a lovely suprise .
F	i was refused a phone_call and my requests of a refund were ignored as i was told again to meet the seller at the venue at the time of the event .
M	delivery is prompt too .
M	the dispatch and delivery was really quick , it arrived the day i expected and i was there to receive the item and it is just what i wanted , good value and good quality .
F	after half an_hour of going round in circles i will not be joining .
M	still no phone after waiting a further 0 days so contacted again to ask when i would get the phone .
F	when complained about it - i received a very offensive and disrespectful answer saying that i have a " small_amount of knowledge that leads to lack of understanding certain things ." and that my judgement regarding the product is erroneous .
F	not happy !
M	i have used this company twice to purchase two fairly expensive items , on both occaisions the service was exemplary
M	in short i can_honestly_say they have provided the worst experience and customer service in my entire history of ordering online .
F	for my aunties_00th they delivered it 0_days early and this left me a little deflated .
M	i would not_hesitate to order from sunglasses_shop again as well as recommending the company to anyone i know !
M	so on this basis they have started to go up in my estimation .
F	i should imagine the heat in the car_park will be unbearable in the summer .
M	i messed_up entering the code and was therefor charged the pre promotional rate .
M	when it was possible to speak to stores direct and departments within the store , information was reliable now , the call_centre staffing is so poor that i have chosen to shop elsewhere as information given to me is both inaccurate and lacking in expertise .
M	as i was unsure of the capabilities of the light his advice was reassuring , but when it arrived i was unsure how to programme it , so i rang back and asked for help and was told to read the manual , which took me aback as i thought i would be advised as i had been the first time , so this marred my experience with why buy new
M	it would be nice to offer covered or partially covered parking .
F	nice prices .
F	even after_speaking on the phone to one of their employees who confirmed that no fee was due , the invoices continued on and on and on .
M	the whole_process was quick and easy and entirely free of swearing and frustration .
M	not the end of the world , but a pain if you could '_ve bought everything from somewhere_else with stock .
M	two drop cards from this courier left in letterbox .
F	correspondence was great re delivery but i was expecting the new beds to be unwrapped and put_together as per online info .
F	unfortunately the courier company used by viovet - city_link - i have found is not particularly customer friendly .
M	will wait a few more days before contacting paypal for a refund .
F	so not helpful .
M	great photobooks , very quick service and great custommer service .
M	the national_tyres fitting_station however was well below_par .
M	good communication .
F	it was intensely irritating to receive promotional discounts on seasonal holidays after i had made my ( christmas ) booking , and on ringing , to find out i would not be eligible , since i had already booked and paid , and anyway i had accepted the offer of a christmas_hamper .
F	excellent delivery times , very easy to do .
F	some of the palest foundations were still very orange and muddy looking
M	they have completely messed_up my dual_fuel account and have been giving empty_promises to resolve the issue for around 0 months !!
F	the delivery address was a business address on a busy main_road , the driver just left them there .
M	good services , good price , good job
M	they are however better in every way than orange or vodafone .
M	if i have a problem .
M	we gave them deadlines and explained that if they could not meet them to just tell us as we had another supplier who could meet them , but we were assured there wouldn_'_t be a problem .
M	it took me
M	ordered on a friday .
F	my other parcel they sent via a 0rd_party courier , tracking now stopped and no way of knowing when or if arrives .
F	shoes are poor quality and every pair fits badly be it too small , too_big or too narrow .
F	definitely 0_stars !
F	at no point did they contact me to let_me know of the delay .
F	i am very pleased with the results .
F	my family and i sat waiting for our food , all starvin !!
F	same as for dvds .
M	bought a couple of t - shirts - quality not that amazing but for £_00 not going to moan .
M	arrived on monday .
M	i then had to return it and get proof of doing so . that was on the 0rd_june , it is now the 00th and they still wont confirm they have had it back because they are returned somewhere_else . load of b * llocks .
F	prompt delivery and excellent value for money , will definitely use them again
F	only issue is that without a fitting service the glasses are not the comfest to wear .
F	the tablet cover was delivered in the wrong_colour despite the enclosed invoice being correct .
M	would never use this company again and would recommend that people stay clear .
F	and that it would be the following_day before delivery was made .
M	people like these should not be in business .
F	it seems to me your employees are taking_advantage of female drivers - just listen to me and offer me your best deal and don_'_t treat me like a child .
M	i am very disappointed and don_'_t think i will be using you again .
M	!
F	there was no problem with it , but it took then 00 days to phone .
F	i am very mad .
M	will never use this site again and would advise others to avoid like the plague
F	best regards
M	to my surprise it was delivered the very next_morning less_than 00hrs after ordering .
F	each of us assumed someone_else had the paperwork , but it seems the rep ( debbie ) didn_'_t give anyone any paperwork .
F	i was very dissapointed with this service and it would make me think seriously before ordering again .
F	called to ask advice and service was great .
M	the screen must be working and intact
M	i subsequently ordered and received the same part from a competitor for £ 0 . 00 delivered .
M	its now the night before the concert and i still_havent got my tickets .
M	£_00 pounds for the game , and it '_s still not here !
M	the bouquet was delivered promptly and by a courteous and cheerful courier .
F	very good site .
F	just all felt a bit drawn_out .
F	i asked for a bank_transfer and my husband got cheques , and for both the service was excellent .
F	absolutely_shocking the amount of time it has taken them to admit this and to still be taking orders and peoples money knowing they would / could not deliver .
F	had i have known that the delivery time would not have been met i would have simply purchased a bouquet from a local_florist to our hotel to take along myself .
M	this is blatant and dangerous incompetence !
F	so a big ' thank_you ' to swell_pets !
F	this is in the process of being done and tap was collected today .
M	i contacted again spoke to the same person and they said again they contact the courier and let_me know .
M	no_problems at all with the actual items when they came .
M	0nd time ( phoned 0000 000 0000 ) - even worse - still on hold after 0 hours !!
F	i got an_email after customer_services had shut saying the driver " couldn_'_t find my office door ", which is quite_frankly bizarre as everybody else can !
F	will definitely use shoetique again .
M	however , it didn_'_t really matter as the order was nothing like the picture / description .
M	i guess a solicitors letter is now the next option and / or a claim through the small_claims court .
F	i have to admit i was one of those annoying customers who are always changing their mind !
F	sloppy things let it down such as having 0 white light_bulb and 0 yellow light_bulb the bathroom and using light_bulbs which
F	i have sold 0 phones with mazuma and had no_problems .
F	i tried to order for the saturday , as the birthday was on sunday but i could not get the site to work so ended_up getting there late .
F	what a joke
F	the customer service is unacceptable .
M	wish i had read trustpilot reviews .
F	don_'_t phone you with updates .
M	i finaly got to the last part which was to put on the roof felt .
M	and cheap , too !
F	waste of money .
F	his party has passed so too late for a replacement so i will be returning this one back to you .
M	eventually my case arrived 0 days_later as i was heading home , and still 0_weeks on nobody from tap in brazil , the uk or in portugal will reply to my emails .
F	i was pleasantly_surprised by mazuma_mobile , i posted my phone on monday and had the money in my account tuesday !
M	avoid .
M	not exactly_what they promise in the adverts !
F	the courier still didn_'_t turn_up within the allotted_time , but fortunately a family_member hadn_'_t started their shift and the parcel was collected .
M	i got what i ordered , exactly when i ordered it for .
F	i was therefore delighted to find beeston_animal_health limited selling a six pack for less_than £_00 with free delivery .
F	i ( checked on line to see that finally my order was on a van to be delivered on thursday , i waited in all day .
M	they need to buck up their ideas and improve customer service .
F	on the whole , they tend to be the cheapest , although they ' re not always the fastest and their packaging does leave a lot to be desired .
F	very impressed with free delivery .
F	if you ' re looking for something beauty wise from top branded fragrances to hand_cream , give these people a look .
F	superdrug get your act_together before you become the next company to bite the dust !
M	!
F	put them on straight out of the packed and literally haven_'_t looked back since .
M	don_'_t order if you expect next_day delivery , they will take your money and you will wait longer_than the next_day .
F	!
M	i ordered a bouquet from iflorist on thursday 00th_september_0000 for delivery next_day ( and paid for this ) the next_day no delivery turned_up despite taking my money .
F	( as i was in a hurry there would be no time to send irt back in order to get the right sizes .)
M	instructions on line very clear .
F	it '_s been nearly a month .
M	chilli_sauce did not have to do any of the leg work as we told them what we wanted , thye priced it up and we went with it .
M	will never use again .
M	checked it over and all looked good , until i got home and had a really good look .
F	excellent service
M	first_class .
F	however , the
M	fast shipment and good pricing
M	ordering was easy and it arrived quickly but they didn_'_t send any " dispatched " emails to let_me know my trainers were on their way .
M	nothing arrived .
M	eventually_managed to find an_alternative phone number on facebook and was able to talk to staff .
F	when i phoned up after 0_months i was told 0_months .
F	the site has a great range and was exactly_what i was looking for , but the parcel was delivered about 0_days after the end of their delivery estimate and i didn_'_t hear from them after the order confirmation_email .
F	i then realised after_placing the order that that was when it would be despatched .
F	the website is easy to use with clear pictures and instructions .
M	first attempt at delivery on saturday , they didn_'_t bother to ring the bell - just chucked one of their ' sorry we missed you ' cards into the shared letterbox outside the front_door .
M	i am still_waiting for it .
F	clear easy to negotiate web_site both for looking at merchandise and ordering .
F	no telephone_number available anywhere .
F	we are of the opinion that the trampoline we got sent was possibly a store reject or a 0nd_hand one that someone_else had returned .
F	three_times we have complained to its managers .
M	a top nascar resource
F	news to me apparently it couldve been there the whole time and i would never have noticed it ???
F	beige fitflops were different_shades and packed in polythene_bag - obviously not a pair !
M	he then_proceeded to verbally abuse me .
M	bargain !
F	the meat / chicken when cooked is delicious .
F	by this time it was too late for us to pick the tickets up from victoria and return in time for the show .
M	so 0 . 00 arrives but no parcel . back to ups .
M	i have already_recommended this site to other poverty stricken bird_feeders .
M	!
F	i know this probably was a genuine mistake but you really should make_sure your customers are receiving what they had asked for .
M	even with their price match , total would be $_000 .
F	zwazea000000000
M	they then came back and said as this wasn_'_t a manufacturing_fault and wasn_'_t reported within 00_hours so there is nothing they can do about it .
M	so i went to another breakers and purchased the same part at the same price .
M	service was so good , that i purchased some more memory on their recommendation .
F	rang up to enquire_about this & they changed it to a saturday delivery .
M	had an enjoyable stay here at the dutchman hotel breakfast nice didn_'_t eat here but the food smelt lovely when we arrived overall would recommend if you like 0 * ratings then maybe this isn_'_t the hotel for you .
M	ordered late_afternoon and delivered the next_morning .
F	that '_s why i keep_coming_back to them .
M	overall very happy
F	delightful company to deal with and good customer service .
F	will check this company out when i need other items first .
F	i ordered a case of brown brothers shiraz but received only six bottles of the shiraz and six bottles of tarrango .
F	i was pleased with the service but a little disappointed the size of the product was not what i expected
M	oh and nuisance callers , why do i have to pay to block sales calls ?
F	in brief .
F	????
F	pleased with the service and would be happy to order from sds again .
M	i asked if they would be using it and was told no and received an explanation to do with printer settings that sounded_like a flimsy excuse .
F	just like british_gas as soon as your momentum gets going you shit on the ' little ' people who help you get there .
M	if only , massive storm on the tuesday and rain wednesday , flooding the inside .
F	don_'_t fix something that '_s not broken !!!
F	extremely disappointed that they would not even consider a refund as a gesture of goodwill , particularly as i had rebooked with them from a different airport .
F	but i must_say i was so impressed with the customer service , delivery and price .
F	she hasn_'_t had them a week yet and they are set for the bin soon .
F	i have used serenata before and they have been great .
F	i am always over charged in their store and the staff are cluless .
F	the package i chose pays out for 0 years but after that you get a guaranteed lump_sum to re - invest .
F	i have yet to receive this refund .
F	the little lollipop included with the package was a lovely touch !
M	i recieved packaging after registry about 0 days_later .
F	fabulous product - good price - fast delivery
M	love the shelving , easy to put up and looks brilliant . however . they decided to use uk mail to deliver .
F	highly_recommended .
F	waiting to see how they check out in bright sunshine overseas .
F	my best friend has to lie face down for a week or more following eye_surgery so i sent her some flowers .
F	my tree arrived well_packaged and in great condition , complete with instructions on planting and the best way to care for my tree .
M	even_though this had been checked twice .
F	the hamper was a well kept secret at the time of booking , having found it on the website i had to make an extra call .
F	i had my parcel delivered to work but i can '_t_believe my name wasn_'_t written anywhere on the outside of the parcel !!!
M	bravo healthexpress et bonne continuation !
F	i did contact cotswold to explain that the wording of their auto_reply needs amending as it is misleading .
F	this is a completely_different excuse why our car was not returned after being told it would take 00_minutes .
M	hurtig_levering
M	this company have a wide_range of goods to suit everyone
F	lenses ordered on sunday evenings normally arrive on tuesdays - that '_s what the website advised .
M	you can '_t contact them !
M	when i spoke to them about the order their advise was helpful and polite .
F	despatch e_mail received on the 00 th april for photographs and photo_book large order so a lot spent .
F	the colour of the tissue_paper was a lot brighter than appeared on screen .
M	i then did the work .
M	the orange package is one of the best around and will use the carphone_warehouse again .
F	so then i had to write on the card the policy number .
M	minimum_fuss , easy to set_up an account and would definitely recommend !!
F	furniture is stunning , have already ordered more furniture , quality is superb .
F	the customer service assistants did their best to help .
F	i am very impressed in the speed and ease of my purchase . quality product .
F	i placed an order for delivery of flowers to my sister in preston , lancs , on 00 feb . 0000 .
M	ended_up with a shelf on one of my racks with no sides as i couldn_'_t be_bothered to ask again for the missing parts even_though i had paid for them !
F	i '_ve ordered from higher_nature thier service is very good and so are the products they sell and you get more for your money its a quick reliable company and i would recommend .
F	i got into work on the monday to find my new bag already here !
M	excellent products delivered quickly .

F	lovely garment . just what i wanted . but not true to size . had to sent for larger than normally worn . returns were very quick . thank_you
M	great .
F	i was very pleased with the purchase from rxsport and would use them again .
F	the cotswold_company website was user_friendly .
F	secondly , the quality of the products varies so much !
M	normally by now they would be fine but i guess i will have to wait a little_longer before they are finally_settled .
F	i booked with alpharooms for a few_days in benidorm and all went well until i checked my bank and the payment was taken out twice i tried to contact them to no avai , l i email them and no reply , i sent several messages through my account which it tells you to do , no reply as yet and that was three_days ago i dont_know what to do wether to wait on them getting back to me or just get in touch with my bank
F	the metal panels were well made , but the frame was not .
F	please take a look .
F	well , i had a bad_experience with this company and in_spite of being a loyal_customer of the company for a long time , once i made a mistake and ordered a wrong_colour printer_ink .
F	i bought two items which were delivered promptly , however i was sent a self_assembly bar_stool with no instructions .
M	i was offered a choice of delivery dates and times by am and pm so no wasting time waiting .
M	i don_'_t think kwik - fit was the cheapest , but it was up there and definitely one of the most well_known companies .
F	quick , efficient and totally amazing service .
F	i will contact you again with the repeat_prescription .
M	shame really as this is my first poor experience and something that is simple when thought through by the sales_team to make a easy fit quick and buyer happy .
F	we had used a £ 0 voucher off the order that you failed to deliver that is now lost .
F	instructions on where to meet your car are also a little vague .
F	will avoid paypal an even co '_s associated with them from now on .
F	just delayed the process and now wait a bit longer .
F	000pm arrives .
M	not sure how they had confused me coming in and having a key programmed !
F	messed_up my meter so that i was no_longer paying on the correct meter number .
M	might be an idea to stock up on the best sellers , i '_ve tried for replacement wicks batteries and melon magic all out of stock .
M	thanks
F	we were dealt_with in a friendly and relaxed manner - no sales_pressure !
M	got free p_&_p to make up for it , but it was a bit shoddy .
M	good friendly service
F	my order took over a week to arrive , after having requested 0 - 0_days ' delivery , but arrive it did , in good condition .
M	anyhow , she said she would get her colleague to call me and let_me know on saturday .
F	and now you ' re asking me for feedback -
M	upstands were bent - what a shame .
M	we want and need our parcels on time .
F	this is the second time i have ordered from lenstore , i ordered on sunday and they arrived on tuesday_morning very fast and efficient service .
F	i might be wrong on this but i dont ' think so .
F	can '_t ask for better_than that !
F	sold this item after it was posted the buyer changed their mind . after a fuss ebay decided the buyer was right and returned his money via_paypal the buyer had to post back .
M	got a the muscle warfare stack and some other itwms for almost_half of what other_sites were selling for .
F	ordering and personalising my glasses was simple and stress_free .
F	brought two whs tyzeck products off tooledup . com . fantastic product , brilliant service , delivery etc .
F	tyres were fitted on my drive , no_hassle or fuss , very convenient .
F	saying that - going to dubai with them this year in upper class so we will see - again - not by choice - just the only ones that flew there on the dates we had where we could use our airmiles to reduce the cost .
M	we have tried to contact by phone and email but cannot get an answer .
F	now that there are so many flea_treatments containing fiprobil , it can be bewildering to choose the most cost_effective .
F	i was uploading 00 photos when it got stuck when i was about 00 in causing me to start all over again , searching for them from numerous different folders - so that was annoying .
M	top quality tools at great prices along with quick delivery .
F	delivery was very quick and as usual excellently_packed .
F	the instructions on line video thing were easy to follow .
M	unfortunately reality did not match our expectations .
M	can '_t fault these jokers at all .
M	also . they wont inform you of any of this , its not until you loose patience & phone up & ask that you '_ll get any information out of them .
M	let_me start by saying that the summer_house is great now it '_s finished .
F	they got to her late in the day , so she didn_'_t get them until the next_morning . that was the only glitch .
F	i had no clue how to get a refund with groupon , so i contacted them and a week or so later i got an_email requesting details and to reply back to help @ groupon . co . uk ( or something like that ) and then a week_later i was informed i had sent it to the u . s groupon ( even_though i did send it to the uk ) so i emailed the uk again .
F	the recipient noticed the van leaving and found the flowers at the front .
F	i suspect they have automated_system for deposits , which is nice , not like in goldmoney . com when you wait for days
F	the company used did exactly_what they advertise , so no_complaints from us at all and you do need someone you can_rely_on when you ' re going on holiday , and someone you can_trust with your car too .
M	scratch that , it '_s not just convenient it '_s everywhere !
F	fantsatic service .
F	hopefully just a one off .
F	:)
F	i checked at 0pm that night and the tracking_info said it was last tracked at the east_london depot at 00 : 00 - so at_least it left the post_office - but then , against the tracking it said " collection attempted - parcel not available " and also " refused acceptance " at 00 : 00 which looks like the receiver would not take it .
M	a place where the malicious can do serious damage to people '_s businesses without either proving who they are , what their motive is etc .
F	my son_loves_his new mattress and i '_d fully recommend this company to anyone in need of a new mattress .
F	00 days_later , i am still fighting to get ziffit to acknowledge that there was a second_batch of books in that box .
F	i '_ve been with simply_suppliments for last 0 years but never got any discount on suppliments or once i had a problem but they didn_'_t sort it out so i had no good experience & customer service with simply_suppliments
F	still , they were polite :-) .
M	what a con !
M	happy with the prompt service and nice packaging
M	.
M	however , i was completely let_down .
F	despite this the website service was easy and very user_friendly .
F	i sent trustpilot my receipt to prove i was a genuine customer but almost two_weeks_later my review is still not showing .
F	lets see what arrives on tuesday .
M	the beer was cleary cheap but acceptable and ( due to temperature ) took somebody working the tap the whole time to get anything but foam into the glasses .
M	now i may be a bit out of touch but that sort of money for a cotton mix sweater , yikes !
F	i know it was cheap , but i did think everything would be genuine .
M	i was happy with product but was no happy because i payed extra for before 00am delivery and they arrived at 00 . 00 i will not use this company again
M	the 0 year_guarantee was a bit_dodgy as i had to pay for the parts but not the labour .
M	i find their subscriptions renewal procedures dubious .
F	the sliding seat is comfortable and the handle bar backrest makes one feel safer , this is a boon as my husband needs to have plenty of rests .
M	.
M	the seller is currently following the compensation procedure but it seems he will be left out of pocket and i will never receive my parcel .
M	this will be the first web_site i visit when i require more lenses .
F	what started out as a bit of a pain ended_up being fantastically well rescued by your customer service team .
F	got an old , dirty , rusty bus instead and had 00 vips to take from london to ascot !!
F	totally brilliant and the way they keep you updated on your delivery was excellent .
M	i recently tried to cancel 0 business lines .
F	i found her to be professional at all times and very patient especially when i delayed in answering emails and not returning phone_calls .
M	we paid for prebookable seats and didn_'_t get them , despite other people sitting in our places , which makes me believe they put up the price of the seat at a later date to see if people would buy , which they obviously did .
F	the man who came was fantastic .
M	will_definitely use again .
M	wife was very happy .
F	i was nervous paying such a lot for the clean but it was completely worth it !
F	if i could give yodel 0_stars i would .
M	another possibility will be parents searching on behalf of their children .
F	she gave_me a quote but i wanted to look through it all first so she emailed it to be right away .
M	that would be a miracle .
F	processed very quickly their end and money transferred straight_away , or cheque posted .
M	regards derek
F	my shopping_experience with bedkingdom was not a happy one , all down to delivery not turning_up when supposed to , then when i was given another date , they still didn_'_t deliver , two_days wasted waiting around for them .
M	and to think you pay £_00 more per_tyre ( so nearly_£_000 more for a set ) than getting them shipped from oponeo . co . uk and paying your local_fitter direct , because they are a " premium " service that is hassle_free .
M	went to windsor store where the sales_assistant suggested " i went to a button shop to buy a replacement ".
F	i have always found delivery to be quick and never had to return anything .
M	probably_won_'_t use escapade again tho !
F	such a lovely selection of chocolate items to chose from the callets have a lovely shine when they have been melted .
F	i would recommend this site to others as the price was also very competitive
F	let_down and a little put off by my first experience :-(
M	i had to call twice before havens had chased the manfacturer and finally got a new estimated delivery date .
F	mazuma was so easy to use , it told me straight_away how much i would get for my old phone .
F	it '_s just hard to believe i got 0 pairs of glasses including the prescription lenses for approx .
F	it got lost .
F	i wish there was no text on the bag though or that it could be customised .
F	unfortunately , i still received a blue one . waste of money as i will not be using it and it is not worth to send it back either
M	0 * service - ordered one day - arrives the next .
F	the customer service is excellent .
M	if you don_'_t pay by paypal then your money will be lost for sure !
F	really easy to use web_site .
F	the service was excellent .
F	i tried to cancel by email but it wouldnt go so i phoned up & spoke to a very nice lady ( who speaks with an accent just like my husband - scottish ).
M	on opening the box_containing the sink basin i found the enamel to be scratched , i immediately contacted the store and arranged a replacement which was a 0 week wait .
M	five_stars for service and quality of product .
F	but don_'_t worry they ' re working on it and here '_s 00_% and another express shipping coupon_code .
F	mattress extremely heavy so requires 0 to lift it .
F	i absolutely love the design of my invites and stationary , and as i took_advantage of the february offer , i got a fantastic deal :_o_)
F	this was to be a birthday_present for my 0 year_old daughter .
M	will_definitely be looking for my next " white goods " on ao . com !
F	i was disappointed that it took them a week to email me to say they had now processed my order and it was ready for collection from the courier .
M	when we turned_up , the company would not rent us the car because we didn_'_t have a second part of of our driver '_s licence .
M	once ordered , i was given regular email_updates on the progress of the pc build which were appreciated .
M	so , very pleased with the service from tyre_shopper - unfortunately less pleased with service from the fitters .
M	i have used this site before and they are consistently excellent .
M	on placing an order i realised the offer hadn_'_t come on at the end of the invoice i therefore phoned the customer service team who were extremely rude & unhelpful , as i ' d only used them once before & also experienced some problems , products missing from my parcel & when phoning also that the staff were rude .
F	i have had many , many successful tutee / tutor interactions through this site with some students staying with me through a levels and their degrees .
F	so i stopped it :).
F	unfortunately the bunch arrived with lilies and geraniums and more foliage than advertised , all of which my mother tends to dislike about bunches of flowers .
M	the furniture is very good quality , beautifully made , and excellent value .
F	it wouldn_'_t have been a problem if they were not fabric sleeping_bags which now has a dirty stain that won_'_t come out !
F	giving the hamper a second chance this week but suspect i will be cancelling after that .
F	the problem that we experienced recently was the following :
M	my turn came and sign read that i had to pay another £_00 .
M	i understand they try to be useful but please , let us buy a product , pay for it , received it ; that should be it .
F	anyway i have reported them to trading_standards for this and also fraud and misrepresentation .
F	but the same cannot be said for the products !
M	instead of looking around in 0 - 0 outlets for specific foods such as grill food , indian , halal .
F	unfortuantely between calls and internet ordering i ended getting two lots of twine and was charged for both items plus postage .
F	after having ordered and paid for 0 pieces of furniture , £_000 in total , we were told the delivery will take 0 to 00 days .
M	poor quality printing , followed_by endless offer emails .
F	arrived next_morning , exactly as_described , very bright but i love them .
F	someone_else '_s parcel was delivered to me , then picked_up again .
F	dhl , ups , parcelforce & the post_office all make 00hour delivery and i wish we had a choice of couriers .
M	i took the trouble to travel to your outlet to purchase white outdoor_lights , to be informed that you only had none of the two pin type left in stock .
M	secondly , my cashback hasn_'_t been credited to my account .
M	after i rejected bozowi '_s new offer , which suddenly was a lot lower_than first agreed for my iphone ,( basically they changed their offer once they had my phone ).
M	on the pervious occasion i was much happier but this time the flowers didnt look anything as vibrant or fresh as the photo .
M	clive vernon
F	i requested delivery at 0 . 00 am for my uncles funeral , by 0 . 00 my cousin texted to say no flowers from australia !!
F	i must_say i would like a bit more flavour .
F	but for 0_days there i didnt know for sure but rest_assured i will not use your company again ,
M	why oh why weren_'_t the instructions updated ?
F	ordered airbed on 00th_june was told would arrive within 00 days , today being the 00th day i know something was wrong so i called for an_eta was told by what sounded_like an_idiot that it had not left the depot and he would look into this and call me back .
F	couldn_'_t reccomend the site more !
F	will avoid in future
F	thankyou
F	they apologised and offered me a refund , which is all i ever wanted .
F	i would say that it was left on the front doormat and whilst my email said " left_securely at the front of the property ", i would definitely say that was not the case .
F	i ordered thank_you cards for family and friends once my daughter was born and the cards and quality were fantastic , i did think it was abit expensive but with the 00_%_off it was we '_ll worth it i wouldn_'_t pay full price as it was a lot .
F	i was timed out twice !
M	tried in several local_shops for cordless phone battery ( currys tried to sell me a new
M	good product and prompt delivery , would use again
F	who on earth would send a christening invite out a year in_advance ?
M	finally someone actually noticed my face going redder and asked if i needed assistance .
F	bought mothers_day flowers , spent 00 on a bouquet which turned_out to be smaller_than_expected .
M	it was delivered .
M	good quick service , nothing more needs to be said .
M	it ’_s the total_lack of action to put things right by either party that make me want fart in their general direction .
M	great stuff !?
M	and why on earth does your name have to be four letters , mine is three !
F	i '_m relieved to say - i was pleased with my final_decision .
F	will definitely order from this company again .
F	i now make_sure i order at_least a week earlier_than i need to with other_companies .
M	the free post bag arrived quickly .
F	the man told me he was making notes and this would be possible .
M	when he turned_up the ordered tyres were not available .
F	delivery is within a few_days as stated and the products are great quality .
F	i sat in your clean waiting room ( which also had womens magazines !!!!)
M	all in all nothing not to be expected .
F	i dont_know_whats happened since google has_been upgraded , its sooo slow , when your typing in a search it takes_forever to catch up with what your typing , and image and shopping results are all scrambled up , loved my google_search before the upgrade , really dont like it now
F	very quick delivery but not sure of effectiveness .
F	the girl i spoke to was rude and unhelpful .
F	great price and fast delivery , would definately recomend to a friend .
M	i don_'_t know where to start .
M	many_thanks .
M	we rang immediately after arrival to ask to be moved or flown home , they had no other villa in the area available and could not get us on a flight home until our due date in two_weeks .
F	thanks , if you made it this far .
M	told by customer_services that product number had changed and that would never have received goods although product was in warehouse .
F	consignee cannot be reached ( cambridge service centre ) 0rd_jan_0000 00 : 00
F	this company has_been reported to trading_standards and with any luck they '_ll be forced to cease trading .
M	my initial attempts to contact nicecans . co . uk via the form on their website and via_email did not receive any response .
F	simple to set_up and is used every day .
F	it was a very quick service and it was waiting for me when we came home though i thought i had to sign for as it came by the tracker post
F	recommending it to everyone .
M	serviço espetacular !
M	i was told i could add a note at the bottom of the order , which in the past i have done but it has never worked .
M	excellent .
F	no answer to the phone number either .
M	the villa_itself appears very tired inside , must doors stick , the furniture is dated and very basic .
M	my wife is 0 feet tall so i don_'_t know what would have happened if i wasn_'_t there .
M	i also bought the solid_oak up stands which really finish off the luxurious look .
F	will certainly use this company again .
M	shipping was next_day and the service was well above my expectations .
F	complicated and fiddly , but at the first claim date we diligently gathered together 0_months of statements and the vouchers and sent our packages off , awaiting a return of £_00 each .
F	the fast , reliable delivery service makes it worth ordering online
F	i hadn_'_t put my order confirmation in and that was requested .
M	initially the response was good , understanding over the phone and had a good record of my past corespondents .
M	products are reasonably_priced and the item arrived in no time at all .
F	from then on the matter was sorted and the service was good .
F	0_weeks_later , after arguing my case and informing asos that i wanted to return the dress , i have been issued a full_refund and it was agreed that asos would send a courier to pick_up the dress .
M	i ) i like outer clothing to be on the large size so that i can wear more underneath and movement is unrestricted .
M	they posted it the next_day .
F	i placed an online order on 0 december , trusting the online statement of " free 0 day delivery ". this is not the case . and is totally misleading .
M	branded goods at fantastic prices , all backed_up with great customer service and a website that '_s a breeze to use .
F	goods are just what i needed .
F	they then lied to us , causing my husband to lose another day '_s holiday .
F	comes well recommended .
F	i had to agree to this as the guy stated there was no other option .
F	therefore i received an item too late to be of use .
F	however products arrived within allocated 0 hour time_slot , helpful delivery man and products just as ordered . always a bonus !
M	it arrived next_day , amazing service and it is just so much_better_than a memory_foam topper tried previously .
F	also we got payment via bank_transfer even this is slow , after sending an_email_saying payment has_been sent and would take 0 working_days the 0st order took 0 working_days and i even emailed customer service but got no response , the second order is currently at 0 working_days at is not yet been received .
M	i recently_purchased a bathroom_suite from bathstore chelmsford , all went to plan up until delivery day .
M	on arrival they had no idea we were coming and had no car available , so we had to drive back in a faulty ( and potentially_dangerous ) car , wasting time and fuel .
F	found it a bit_overwhelming and havent been totally happy with all my purchases
M	in 0 0 / 0 years we lost £ 0000 with not a godamn thing to show for it , as a result of this company '_s ignorance , contempt and utter arrogance .
M	no_hassle .
M	clubs were delivered on time with no problem .
F	hassle_free
M	given that i did not get a good night '_s sleep it meant that i struggled to complete my scheduled journey from ijmuiden .
M	to my consternation , the replacement was similarly blocked from rotating , and clearly there has_been a retrograde design change , rendering the light very much less useful as a wall spot light .
M	however the delivery firm arrived a day early when the house was empty .
F	all information i gave scubastore when i purchased seemed to get lost with the arrival in bangkok .
M	et nous voilà avec fedex , carton en mauvais état , livreur avec_la cigarette au bec … ce_n ' est_pas la première fois avec fedex que cela se passe mal .
F	this is the second time ive hired a car with this company and found the staff very helpful and service has always been fast and efficen , will be sticking with them on my next visit to tenerife !
M	their are some good deals . waiting to see how long it takes for delivery .
F	i '_ve had over_£_000 back !!
F	although there are lots of alternatives now , i like to use jessops to produce photobooks - the software is easy to use and the service is quick and efficient .
F	the day after that i received an_email to say they had it and had credited my bank_account with the £_00 .
M	rob
F	katie , answer this . the negative_reviews , how can there be so many ?
M	once blind arrived , it fit the window perfectly , which was great .
F	just pull up , hand over keys and go .
M	0 has_been crashing my computer with memory malfunction .

F	great product at a really good price .
F	as we walked we saw other groups who '_s guide was well ahead of them and people struggling with an injury .
F	the bottle of bubbly , so would be hesitant_about ordering from the site again .
F	placed an order for a quad_bike before christmas and was informed that it would probably arrive on the 00nd or 00rd_dec but if not , definitely on the 00th .
F	would definitely recommend using this company to anyone .
M	jeg surfer tit rundt på cykelbutikker på_nettet , men er havnet rigtig mange gange med at købe hos cykelgear . dk efterhånden .
M	think flat_pack - everything you need in the box !
F	these are the things i liked .
M	this company are now causing me a great deal of stress and i am genuinely getting ill because of it .
M	well i have to say dpd were as good as their word to me yesterday .
M	le to do the same one day soon .
M	will not be using company again .
F	the only_thing it lacks in my opinion is creating an account so you can log in .
M	david : 00 : 00 : 00 are you saying i have to pay to get it back after its yodels mistake ?
M	why i can not tell you ,
M	however , the products haven_'_t worked and my dogs still have fleas .
M	it arrived the next_day .
F	i will expect a full_refund , priority delivery and i will never use your service again , or recommend you .
M	i have been completely_ignored , accused of lying , error making , disbelieved , lied to , fobbed_off and iflorist have totally failed to adhere to their contract , accept any responsibility for the blunder and have made no attempt to apologise .
M	parcel 0 out for delivery oct 0th after calling every day for 0 days being promised each time it will be out the following_day with no deliverys i spoke to kay '_s then finally on the 00 th oct i was told by yodel they carnt find it and i will get a refund off kay '_s . parcel 0 has .
F	when my parcel arrived only one pair of the leggings were delivered , someone had scribbled in pen on the dispatch_note ' not sent ' on the item which i did not receive .
F	suffice to say we could not use the open top as we didn_'_t understand italian !
M	blackcircles retrieved the tyre for inspection & told me that they would contact me when they knew more .
F	would certainly use again !
M	), but no crisps and no luxury meat seasoning , despite them being on the packing list .
F	notenotenote ;
F	this would have been helpful to tell me that they didn_'_t have any in stock when they confirmed my order and took my payment .
F	i use this site for presents mainly at christmas and birthdays . and will_continue to do so in the forseeable_future .
M	finally it '_s a bit_annoying when you receive a discount_voucher offering cheaper parking 0 day after booking !
F	!
F	i '_ve just found out that i '_ve been paying £_00 a month and not getting my 0g - awful .
F	i like the wide_range of items on offer and i like some of the specially priced offers .
M	see_above lack of any instrusctions
F	do not order from this company .
M	i suppose my money is lost and i will have to look_elsewhere for the product .
M	whats disturbing here is it seemed that between the time i ordered the phone and when i followed up with an email a week_later to see where it was that my order was in limbo .
M	really like muscle_foods .
F	ordered invitations for my daughters_christening , was a bit_dubious as the price was 00_%_off at checkout but i have to say i cannot be_happier !
M	after finally making my choice , the checkout_process was very simple and within no time at all , my package arrived .
M	sorry .
M	my record so for is fastest - 0 0 / 0_weeks , slowest - 0_weeks .
M	third time ive_used_tyreshopper and very pleased again this time i used them for a set of four tyres for my van got a set of good quality barum vanis tyres cheaper_than my local tyre shop could do a set of very low quality budget tyres had them fitted by national_tyres and the guys there are very helpfull and efficent great all_round service and products a0 ****
M	i sent a small chain away to them the value , the value they gave was some £_00 below my local shop , so i declined the offer it was then as they put it re - offered at £_00 more than the original and still below my high_street .
M	will also take the opportunity to get my front pirrelli zeros checked as i keep having to put more air in them every other week .
F	if you prefer a mild coffee this could suit you very well .
F	i got home from work on tuesday and a collection card been put through my door .
F	fingers_crossed
M	after phoning up customer_services the part was then sent out later that day due to me desperately needing the part .
M	as it is i have had to resort to another separation solution which looks much less neat and less professional .
M	i am now waiting to chat to customer service again and have been waiting in the queue for over half an_hour .
F	0_days after the courier was supposed to have delivered , a neighbour gave_me a box that he had taken in 0_days earlier but due to shift patterns hadnt been able to catch us in .
M	after constant pestering by the company i feel obliged to reply .

M	very pleased with the quality of the meat , packaging excellent . cannot_fault the delivery operation . look_forward to a long relationship with westin_gourmet .
M	it all went south with the takeover of amazon and subsequently i have just cancelled my membership as not wasting anymore money .
M	i have always been perfectly satisfied with the service .
F	i don_'_t think i '_ll order again , but if you ' re into meat , by all means try them and decide for yourself .
F	it was delivered when they said it would be ,
M	it was once a place for a bargain or a niche product , now it '_s full of traders , used products cannot properly be separated from new ones in the search and you are forced to have a paypal_account .
F	full_marks to serenata_flowers .
M	the following_morning , one box arrived as arranged and i showed the delivery driver both delivery cards and was told both items were in one box .
M	in the end i had to get in touch with the delivery company .
F	the website says you are allowed 0k each for hand - luggage , which is barely enough for a laptop + case - although in fact at both airports our hand_luggage was not weighed .
M	i was caught off guard by the cold caller who offered a discount on this product for £_00 , only if i paid there and then by credit_card over the phone .
M	many_thanks !
F	i booked a flight through ebookers , unfortunately had to cancel within 00hr .

F	product is great and arrived quickly . once the order went through .
F	not happy with discounts here .
F	i have already planned 0_days in edinburgh as part of my holiday , and have no desire at this time to visit ayr - i have planned a holiday to glasgow .
M	so that option was quickly withdrawn from the list of options_available to purchase on the day .
F	i love the food they offer and it is so convenient .

F	when i complained , and threatened to cancel my contract , they were happy to cancel my contract immediatey and made no attempt to make_amends .
F	how did this happen ?!
M	i returned an item and chose the option to cover the return postage myself .
F	they really helped make our holiday .
M	all in all very good !
F	i have never come_across such an inadequate instruction_sheet in all my life , and i `_m 00 years old .
M	i came to halfords_autocentre for a free brake and engine checks and got my vehicle back in messy condition : some of wheel_bolts wasn_'_t tight enough , engine cables were loose and not on the right place , an engine and around it was dirty .
M	i vcannit stress enough how bad an experience they provided , thank_god for sky .
M	last_week i was telephoned by someone from zenith home improvements .
M	main_reason is that when faced with a considerable_amount of money and what to do with it in order to get the best deal for you , then there is always a worry that you may choose the wrong doors to go through but with the help of employees like leanne_smith , who , with her expertise in guiding_me through the transition process it was made very simple indeed and hassle_free , so for that i have to say a huge thank_you to her for that service .
F	each item was very well_wrapped and i was impressed with the quality of the furniture .
M	i '_ve been told its going to be another few weeks before this can be resolved .
M	rang to place order , waited 00_minutes on the phone listening to that aweful music they play , this was the only bad thing , other than that it was a good experience .
F	on the bright side , the shower_tray looks great and we are really pleased with ensuite end_result .
M	once the gel holder arrived it was too big for the included defuser in the light kit , so i ordered the correct defuser as a kit including 0 grids but when it arrived it was an incomplete kit only containing 0 grid .
M	when i came to the office to take a car at milano airport bergamo , suddenly i found out that insurance i pied is nothing ; i had to pay for the full insurance to the company 000 eur more and additionally deposit 000 eur .
M	atom00 has_been a partner agency for a few_years on a major client - and they certainly know their online onions inside out .
F	zwazea000000000
F	warning to all avoid topman !
M	eleven days after ordering the phone i checked the status of my order on their website only to discover that my order had not even been dispatched .
M	actually is better quality than some well_known_brands .
M	anyway , following a stressfull start we had a great holiday and no_problems on return .
M	affordable_supplements went on to say that they usually receive compensation from the delivery company for late deliveries and they would then pass that amount on to me .
F	products ok and well priced , but delivery quite slow and packaging all damaged hen received .
F	packaged well , end_result exceeded my expectations , would recommend this service to friends .
F	sent off phone
M	good prices , kindly service and expert staff
M	will_definately_use pet_supermarket again .
F	once found the door was easy to collect items ( could do with an obvious sign to say ring the bell near the collection door )
M	i purchased this small item and found the cost of the item was reasonable but the postage was far to high for such a small item making the overall cost far to expencive , it also thought it took a bit to long to arrive for the cost charged .
M	not sure yet if i start getting calls from canvassing companys because my information has_been sold on ile stop useing the internet
M	it '_s now september , phones 0 u say they ' re waiting for t - mobile whilst t - mobile are waiting for phones 0 u - they have also damaged my credit_history due to not having received a payment .
M	complained on the chat system and they spoke to the pizza place who are adamant i took the food .
M	they have only lasted a couple of days and some were already dead on arrival .
M	very reassuring service .
M	ordered books from this company on several_occassions .
F	having made a purchase on sat 00th_january i was told delivery would be monday 00th_january .
F	this sizing is absolutely ridiculous .
F	on the 00th they tell me you can not track it and the goods are not in stock – someone is telling fibs somewhere
M	looking on the internet for my dogs_medication which company shall i go with well i chose viovet didnt know much about them i gave them ago and never looked back everything about them is first_class i would recomend them to everybody so be like me and give them ago you will never find a better company that cares for your_pets_needs
F	if they do this to many people they will get quite a bit of interest on our money !
F	garment was fantastic .
F	from the ordering process to the delivery of the shoes was first_class .
F	after there was something wrong with the payment i called the next_day to pay over the phone .
F	was offered a 00_%_off voucher for guaranteed valentine '_s day delivery .
M	not so happy as i really needed them the previous day .
F	the courier had dropped_off my parcel a good distance to where i live , and didn_'_t do the decent thing by posting me a notice card informing_me about the parcel , which_resulted_in me calling customer_services to check if its been dispatched .
F	have bought much_cheaper covers before that have been far_superior .
M	mr_r hunter
F	i sent another email directly to 0ourhouse . co . uk , one month later no response .

F	i have bought goods online for years without_any problem whatsoever , with physioroom , it '_s all ok until something_goes_wrong then you can '_t get them to refund your money !
F	don_’_t think so !

F	if no response within two_days phone them , what a waste of time and money , a could , nt run a pxxs up in a brewery springs to mind .
F	in mid_january i bought a double solid_oak bed_frame from the dreams store in norwich .
M	to be fair this was dispatched with next_day delivery as soon as sigma where advised however it was disappointing .
F	very disappointing .
M	i was charged an " airport fee " in addition to the initial fee paid online plus an " out of hours fee " despite it being a saturday_afternoon at a ski destination .
F	only use this company if you ' re desperate .
M	his behaviour towards her was quite rude as was his reply , which may account for her uncaring attitude on that particular day .
M	excellent service , item delivered very quickly
M	when it works , great .
M	it '_s a real_shame that i was able to place an order and pay only to be told there is no stock and no idea when i will receive it !

F	he also helped_me to identify a product i had been unable to find and sent me samples to be certain that this was exactly_what i was looking for .
M	enjoy .
M	the worst part is they suggest ( up to ) 00 days delivery and try to sell you an earlier delivery at cost .
F	courier wouldn_'_t take the wrong one .

F	dont book a party in these rooms - they dont_know what they ' re doing .
F	anyone going to respond !!!
F	a really easy website to use , every brand you want to find , delivered very quickly in super safe packaging .
M	all in all they are a horrible company to deal with , don_'_t be suckered in by their cheap deals as what you may have saved in money , you pay for in time , effort and stress with having to deal with rude and frankly incompetent staff .
M	i thought this was fantastic as a sky sport customer and sports fanatic .

M	live_chat unable to deal with after sales .
F	draw . bought some leggings . quality was ok but not impressive to say the least .

F	on a saturday the drop_off is on the ground_floor car_park ( level 0 ) there was an illegible hand_written board on the entrance so needed to circle the car_park to find a suitable entrance - there were no markings for individual car_rental lanes a sort of free for all with no signs , no lane markings , no people to ask .
M	very well_laid_out site , easy to find what your looking for .
M	the part that i ordered through partmaster was as_described and cost £ 0 . 00 with an additional £ 0 . 00 postage a total of £_00 . 00 .

M	the price was very reasonable and it arrived next_day .
M	great purchasing experience , received within 00_hours of placing my order .
M	as for the mattress / bed - i must_admit i am disappointed .
M	i ordered the brave blu_ray for my daughter '_s birthday ( which was yesterday ).
M	the delivery men were quick and efficient and very polite .

M	i ordered from our local takeaway as we had done for just under a year .
F	i knew when it left ( which was the next_day ) when it was with royal_mail and had an_email_saying it had arrived at my house .
F	on checking site a week_later found item in stock again but no one had let_me know , so understandable disappointed .
M	i then emailed him a copy of the postage receipt and have sent several emails for the attention of this manager , but so_far he has failed to reply to any of them .
F	overall a positive_experience but i did pay for express delivery and do not feel that i got it which was a shame .
F	would recommend this company .
M	what more can i say ?
F	we are overall very satisfied with thus company and shall_continue to purchase items and spread the word about them .
M	would definitely buy from the again .
F	very impressed .
M	finally , she seemed to get it and i '_m keeping my fingers_crossed and waiting_patiently until next month to be sure they finally did get it right .

F	i am really happy with them and have had many_compliments already .
M	prompt delivery of order .

M	easy to order , arrived on time and pleasantly_surprised by the quality !
M	quick and easy
M	well i spent some time getting prices for my items and packing them up .
F	i then spoke to their complaints_department and had a painful conversation with them where they were reluctant to even apologise !
F	we could have had another 0 0 / 0 hours at resort .
F	shame really .
F	i am bracing myself for a long struggle to sort this out because you just know its not going to be easy , i wish we had switched on moving in and swallowed a leaving fee because we would probably have saved time and money .

M	the rest of the products came on the 00 . 00 . 0000 .
F	!
F	i have let the cuts clear and tried again - same pain .
F	good choice of products but i think that the delivery cost is too high .
M	even_though pc '_s are restricted , if it came to it i know the law is on my side so if the package is damaged i would settle it in court and win : p
M	had to wait fo about 00mins . as the delivery company only had one delivery guy .
F	after getting the email_confirmation later that day , i saw they autocorrected the main persons_name on the tickets to the card_holders name when taking the payment over the phone .
F	we also had one on - line quote which is next to useless but no - one else seemed to bother .
M	charged for ' free ' glasses .
M	returning the car was also slow as we waited five_minutes for someone to inspect again and then a further ten_minutes as there was no one working the returns desk .
M	by 0pm oz time there was no sign of the flowers .
F	the lady in payments was very supportive .
F	i hav ordered several_pairs now and every time i '_m amazed_at how quickly they arrive then your amazed_at how they can be so cheap compared to the high_street_opticians .
F	now that i '_m out of options - annoying these people is my current goal ( lack of funds being my motivation ) and will_continue to annoy them until someone gives me my merchandise or my money .
M	these problems include having the wrong record sent out , or even not having some records sent out .
M	so maybe ok now .
M	when i re - checked the website - it still showed my hat colour in my size in stock ?
F	?
F	i went into the local shop when the deal was online but they had the laptop in but not on the same deal !!

F	and quick
M	avoid !!
F	however in may_0000 i receive the confirmation_email . at_least it was the email late and not the flowers .
M	u will not b disappointed
F	disappointing - for the price you pay you should be able to expect excellent results .
F	after_reading_reviews i chose this model but the prices elsewhere were prohibitive .
F	very comprehensive_list of products .
M	brilliant service .
F	the website advertised that if i ordered before 0pm ( it was 0 . 00pm ), my flowers could be delivered same day .
F	but don_'_t expect the delivery drivers to be helpful .
M	avoid_avoid_avoid
F	i tried to contact the company being on hold for 00_minutes at a time and constantly getting cut_off by an_automated_system telling_me my call would be answered within 0 minute .
F	but , i am amazed_at the appalling lack of customer service .
F	including getting the ring sent to me even quicker_than they specified .
M	======================

F	as it was a christmas_present for my young son , we didn_'_t open it until christmas day .
M	loved the car , the prices and the overall package .
F	the recipient was happy with the flowers , but i was disappointed as to the service .
F	they took it away and i had to wait an extra 0_days for delivery so this " express delivery " jokers masqulatie is a joke !
M	nah forget it because it costs more in p_&_p for multiple items .
F	no effort at all to try and deliver and just because i live in a road of flats they choose not to deliver to my flat !
M	i ordered a pair of trousers on the 0th_january , with a delivery time of 0 - 0 working_days .
M	well_done and keep it up .

M	giving me the impression that if they said my condition was work related , i would be able to claim .
M	every time i get an expected date for delivery it passes by and now going by the recent date it will be one year to receive the light , if it ever arrives !

F	the colour and detail on the slate is great !
M	the guitar arrived very well_packed and in excellent condition , as i was assured it was over the phone .

M	however the true level of customer service cannot be fully assessed until after i have received my ticket and fly to my holiday destination and back .
F	chose a delivery date which was my choose because the company where delivering in my area ( could of been delivered two_days previous ).
F	i received the printer i ordered promptly , although a kind neighbour came to my door to inform_me that it had arrived there the day before .
F	it was colourful and gave off a lovely scent , both of which were important , but i couldn_'_t_believe_how quickly it was over , given that the oasis had been kept wet .
F	wine was well_packaged .
M	no_complaints .
M	the delivery company is useless .

M	hi " friend ??"
F	great value for money , delicious meat and an exciting alternative to the norm .
M	i would definitly recommend and use them again .
F	avoid !!!!!
M	used to use basic service now only use signature deliveries which obviously costs more due to past experiences
M	send a message and wait a day before any reply back .
F	our 0 regret was not taking picture evidence of the amount of petrol left in the tank ( we were sure that there was half a tank left , but our petrol light came on as soon as we left the car_park !)
F	delivery on time and good value .
F	we are very sad and disappointed !
M	so_far , i '_ve spent hours on the phone to various lovefilm departments .
M	first item i had purchased from oak_furniture_land and i was amazed at the service level from_start to finish .
M	simple to use website , received product in good time , quick delivery .
F	complained via their contact page and just got the standard response saying being looked into .
F	its so easy to do , and means you actually look back on your photos instead of hoarding them on the computer .
M	kwell i was on sky ditched then , orderd a brand_new service from talktalk they took the existing line over issued me a new tt number which had a totaly different prefix as do virgin and sky mostly than local bt wholesale numbers , all went on all good on time , i signed_up to essentials and then added a boost for more data , then added mobile and international boosts in the next few weeks , i did notice my router was signal dropping i called got through to a call_centre in manilla in the phillapines but the guy was clear and understood him perfectly he did something on his side and changed my router frequency , problem sorted and from calling to ending it took 0 mins , 0_weeks_later i broke my router my fault i knocked it over so a call to talktalk i fessed up said it was my fault and to my suprise the lady i spoke to said to me thats fine we will replace it free , then she looked at my account and said the package you are on and boosts your paying too much and did me a deal of all deals upgraded my account to broadband plus with unlimited uk calls including 0000 0000 and got the 000 mobile mins now 0000 boost and the international deal all for £_00 . 00 a month no one can beat that , so months go by all good no_probs until one day i get a welcome call from talktalk for a random person i was like no im not him but i am on talktalk the lady was miffed as she says the numbers are predialed on her screen , we both laughed it off and thought nothing of it , then with in 00_hours getting messages off people asking why im not picking_up my land line i picked_up my phone theres a dialing tone all in order as it seems , i called my mobile then saga begins i seen the number on the caller display , it wasnt my number ,
M	the driver did not wait to see if the door was answered , leave with a neighbour or hide it behind an available large rose tub .
M	good price easy to use . you get your own bespoke_design
F	( by contrast , two other orders placed with online_retailers over the same weekend were delivered on monday and tuesday ).
M	i did three trades back to back and had to contact customer_services each time to see where my cash was .
F	ordered 0 voile roman_blinds .
M	why do you need my driver '_s license ?
M	another reason for not rating 0_stars is your policy on " automatic payment after 0 days " if the offer has_been revised .
F	my costume arrived very quickly and is great !
F	one very happy lady .
M	thank_you for being so professional , a great credit to your company .
F	i get fed_up with constantly nudging to try to get my cashback , it becomes a chore .
F	0 jan_0000 00 : 00 : 00 am cambridge_cambridgeshire gb arrival scan
M	this could of course be down to the postal service so i wait with interest how it will be resolved .
F	you published that fact that the comment was removed for being offensive and coarse , did not republish the edited version and have my name on the forum still as being coarse .
F	the customer_services representative followed up my order with a personal phone_call to ensure that polybags had met with my expectations .
F	great service , very prompt and excellent product .
F	i would certainly recommend krs if anyone asked me how to initiate equity_release .
F	they looked amazing on and they were really good quality .
M	the way sky is managed is a complete disconnect with no - one allowed to either take_ownership of a problem nor use their initiative .
M	oil and filter changed for less tahn price of oil from halfords .
M	the items i purchased were of a better quality than i had expected for the price .
F	i was very pleased with the service i got / recived with jokers my order was delivered almost within days of placing my order ill defo be ordering from here again
M	and virgin comes out well on top . easy to use great reception . give me virgin any time .
M	very promptly received and well_packaged with clear_instructions .
F	as we live on a farm it still left him unable to get any essential exercise .
M	this time i '_m a student so every_penny counts towards my investment plans at the moment .
M	he explained in detail the pluses and minuses of equity_release .
M	this never happened .
M	i will_definitely become a regular customer .
M	excellent price paid for sunglasses in the sale with free delivery however the 0 - 0 days delivery ended_up being 0 days .
M	!
M	( i am not related to anyone in the company but if they wish to pay me commission for this advert name and adders included he he just joking )
F	i booked through booking . com because it worked out £ 0 per_person cheaper however i was not aware that they do not take they full payment straight_away so i am now out of pocket and i will not be booking through booking . com again .
M	when you find you can only download at 000kb / s ( likely due to network congestion from the aforementioned lack of bandwidth for the entire icuk network or as a result of traffic shaping implemented to compensate the lack of bandwidth ), your only means of resolution is to fire off an email to their support_team which will go_unanswered until the following_day .
M	this is now where talktalk starts to become a problem i had to call them repeatedly to resolve the issue as i twigged by asking in my flats as we live in a block of 00 it was a new person_who had recently_moved in , the openreach engineer had managed to swap our lines in the junction_box outside our flats , but try telling that to some one in manilla they basically couldnt digest the issue and also the same time i was waiting for a brightspark to install my youview never showed up , so by monday after ringing customer retentions kicking off demanding to end my contract again fobbed_off saying it takes 0 to 0 days for a manager to deal with a complaint , still stuck with someone_elses phone n bb service and they have mine , basically talktalk blaming open_reach so i finally get a call off open_reach this rude guy , when i told_him the issue he was saying thats not my job you need a home visit im an exchange engineer ring you provider and make an appointment , so im ready to tear my hair out not , so i finally rang talktalks head_office left my issue and complaints , then i get a guy call me to say he is from the dheif executives office and he is personally dealing_with my account , finally we got to the bottom of it , yes it was open reaches fault not directly talktalks but the issue is talktalk and openreach have a very poor communication system as the bt guy when he come to my house explained , the work blind with just a job number and no line or work info theese errors especially buildings with multipul lines going into the building sometimes the cant figure_out whos is whos because they just dont_know unless the number is given on the job sheet talktalk dont due to customer privacy but a huge ball ache for the engineer , after 00 days i was back up and running with my own service and i negotiated 0 months free service as a £_00 credit , so if you have any major issues ring talktalks head_office and ask to speak to the cheif executives office they are the powers who be , but on that note i am happy with what i have and when my sister moved_house and told her to get talktalk for the prices and deals shes never had an issue her self apart
M	placed an order on the phone for silver_lining flowers the gentleman_who took the order called the florist to see if they could give me the same day service and he said he could .
M	i booked the cheapest option for one night using the hostelbookers system .
F	i was troubled to hear that the flowers had been left_outside the door and not delivered to the recipient in person .
M	three_weeks_later the order is still showing a new status with no_indication of dispatch date .
F	told me my phone was faulty and only paid me £ 0 . 00 , phoned to complain and they wouldn_'_t send me my phone back have contacted trading_standards rip_off merchants !!!!!!!!!
F	they used to be the place to go to if you wanted a last_minute holiday . but now they ' re just as , if not more_expensive than a travel_agent .
M	me & my partner went into the shop , they were very friendly & were served by ollie , he was polite , listened to what we wanted and gave his advice when asked .
M	i called 000 and was told , " oh , that '_s easy : you need to give us 00 days written notice so all you need to do is go to our website , click this link and then that link and state that you ' d like to cancel the lines .
F	unfortunately it means that my thumb is nearly lost in the support because it is too long , might have been better with a small , also the velcro around the thumb cuts a bit into the tissue where my thumb joins my hand .
M	i bought 0 of the boot_liners on my daughters recommendation and am really pleased with the outcome .
M	which i don_'_t intend mentioning here , as i would sooner see the companies fail ?
F	i did write and complain before about the lack of care in packaging and suggested they review it at their earliest convenience , obviously this has not been done .
M	i took a gamble and placed an order .
F	when were they going to let_me know this , if i hadn_'_t contacted them ?
F	the first time i ordered a jumper to try them out was extremely bad .
M	slightly_disappointed in that having waited 00 weeks for delivery of our lounge suite and dining_table to find that one of the chairs was missing the feet , which now means we have to wait another 0 - 0_weeks for delivery of these items so we can use the chair .
M	was attracted_by the £_00 joining bonus , and then went on to earn enough to get over the payout threshold .
M	friendly delivery staff .
F	the parcel did arrive but this was a day later than i paid for .
M	can only contact online .
F	i used the chocolate for the first time yesterday : i made a chocolate shell for a giant cupcake - the chocolate melted smoothly , quickly and to a velvety smooth , wonderfully aromatic liquid .
F	i paid an additional £ 0 . 00 charge for this delivery .
F	quick delivery , order sent out by different shops .
M	price great with my discount_voucher . content quality fine_except for the full a0 pages and cover which were disappointing with striations in the blue sky . though the church were happy i was not and would think_twice befor i used this service from jessops .
F	what a totally shambolic company .
M	broadband as everyone_knows is rapid , yes you never get the full speed quoted but it is more than most will ever need , soon to be increased too .
F	this site allows students and tutors to get together and get on with the job of learning .
F	the process from_start to finish was quick , easy and efficient .
M	laurain chapman
F	i will certainly order from them again .
F	very pleased with the pirate_outfit , good value for money .
M	i '_m undecided right now .
F	suggest other customers check the wood matches before cutting it !
M	it seems there have been other problems .
F	the loading stewards were very helpful and suggested that if i could get a breakdown to me within the hour they would guarantee me a 0pm sailing .
F	this company comes with the highest reccommendation possible .
M	i have since heard from time talk and they have decided to credit me back the £_00 because as they admitted their salesperson had made a mistake in allowing me to believe they would simply pay back the breakage fee .
M	we were initially given a date of next friday for the french_polisher but after explaining once again our displeasure of living in a mess for so long already they promised to look into the diary closer , now we have got an appointment for this monday .
F	thank_you for the excellent service , i would happily_recommend your website to friends and family .
M	thanks cjs !
F	i logged on and it was very easy - placed my order - posted one day - cash the next .
M	processing normally takes less_than 0 hours but may take up to 00_hours .
M	stylish , well made and look far more costly than they are .
M	the whole_thing took under half an_hour which is an eye_opener compared to the 0 hour wait i suffered at kwick_fit .
M	really pleased with the site i been getting some great deals and with work im all over the country and have found it so easy to get booked up .
M	products arrived quickly , good line of products , sizing was questionable on the item i bought but that is due to manufacturer however a note on the site to say sizes can be small would have helped
M	i will not buy that product again .
M	then once you '_ve made your order you sit_back and let boiler_juice do the work .
M	men jag antar att man_får vad man betalar för :-_d
F	sadly my old dog died but i couldn_'_t stand an empty house so i got 0 new dogs ( one was a runt ) i am a sap for a poor case . however , i needed to train these pups they were bouncing off one another barking etc .
F	the caller then hung_up the phone on me and it was abundantly clear that they could not care less as the contract was signed and we had no option but to make the final payment .
M	nice to have done business with you .
F	good choice of products , excellent value for money
M	viovet are an amazing company .
M	my son was very excited to get his new scooter and thank_god he only has to wait one day before the super_fast delivery arrived .
M	the furniture is of poor quality and is not due to transportation damage but workmanship .
F	i rent a car for 0_days in miami ( usa ) i have an american driver license and they did not want to accept it !!!
M	- have to remove bad comments as well to get it back . cant insult the bozowi system . think they may be based in north korea . thanks for asking me to give feedback !. see if this get posted this time . or just positive ones as normal .
F	looked at a number from various_sources including homebase as the store is not too far away and shopped there quite_often .
F	they said the part on order would be in stock on monday 0nd_december and when it comes in they will then contact me with an_appointment date .
M	my delivery lived_up to all my expectations . extremely well_packed , delivered on time and the battery was exactly as specified .
F	then i was told by both people that the invoice was attached to the front of the cards , stating the price i had payed .
F	won_'_t be buying from them again , and certainly wouldn_'_t recommend at all .
F	eventually i got in touch with trading_standards who advised me to write to them demanding my money back since after 00 days they had breached their contract by not delivering .
M	sorry .
M	i am very happy with the item but puzzled why it took so long to post out .
M	let '_s be honest : selling houses isn_'_t difficult .
M	i considered returning them but to be honest couldn_'_t face the prospect so re - fitted the lenses myself having looked at how they were secured on the sunglasses which were fine .
F	i made an online purchase of a rug .
M	the small hook magnets are disappointing as they don_'_t seem to hold that good not like the large one wish we never brought them and stuck with the larger ones
M	all provided screws rounded as soon as the mildest amount of force was applied making them unusable .
M	but if you order the wrong product , or it gets sent to the wrong_address , you pretty_much have to fend for yourself - not ideal .
M	excellent service good price these batteries are cheaper_than when i last looked .
M	i have used the product before , but am just frustrated at delivery .
M	as a former professional_photographer i would recommend jessops to anyone .
F	so i stopped_talking to them !
F	i will be recommending glasses diredt to my friends .
F	it transpired_that the suite was not available .
M	of any item and check with other_websites .
M	the post_office counter even told me to pay extra for peace of mind as it needs to be signed for otherwise it '_s returned to myself !
M	would like to see a better ( wider ) choice of sizes .
F	when you do decipher it , you go onto the web address to track it but the ref_number is not recognised , so you telephone the number and they don_'_t recognise it either !
M	we were delighted with the service we received from fireprotectioneonline . co . uk
F	i e_- mailed with a complaint as i had not received it , they did not even apologize they just said that they could see it had been delayed !
M	great site .
M	00 / 00 / 00 - update
F	by the way , during this time , the offer ( pending voucher ) had completely disappeared from ' my purchases ' on my groupon account and also , the only way i could log_into my account was by going to purchase another deal .
M	arrived very quickly and delighted with the end_result .
M	checked them out and the efficiency and value for money was top_notch .
F	order made and we got super_fast delivery .
F	barely scratched or marked .
F	i contact them to ask why when i have cancelled and they sent another email_confirming it was cancelled .
F	did find that it seem to take hours to update on the status of the parcel , which is not so good .
M	the seats were only a few rows from the very top of the stadium .
F	i purchased a fancy_dress costume for my daughter through ebay from megafrancydress .
F	i emailed three_times , and rang twice .
M	i wasted an entire day , nine frustrating hours , sitting here , waiting for the courier ( fedex ) to collect .
F	loved them and then made three more additional purchases - two via the internet .
M	eventually yodel checked to see if my package was in the depot , but only after i asked them to .
F	you are clearly in breach of the distance_selling regulations 0000 , as you have not provided me with the information that i need to return the product .
M	silly .
M	took too long to get to me via germany and the delivery was missing a speak plug .
M	two_days_later , my dark boost arrived , two_days after that they were no_longer in stock !
F	i wont_be using them again , id rather pay extra money and know my complaints , if any , will be dealt quickly and efficiently .
F	after checking my policy i noticed i had answered a question incorrectly , phoned the customer service who sorted things out within and hour .
M	i received a generic_reply explaining that nectar_points are given out 00 days after a trip was completed .
M	i was initially quoted £_000 .
F	i didn_'_t .
F	the service received was very good .
F	on christmas day the item didn_'_t appear to work properly - kept on freezing , couldn_'_t hold a battery charge , wouldn_'_t recognise internet_connection .
M	we phone up sagepay and all they can do is send an email to elavon .
F	i have been disappointed with the length of time it takes to be paid larger_amounts of cash_back .
F	i input the dayes and wet througb the various screens before inputting card_details .
F	this matter has now been placed into the hands of my solicitor and trading_standards .
F	needed to cancel a flexible booking but the website would not complete the cancellation .
F	i would have gave sheds . co . uk a 0_*.
M	when you do get contact from them , they deny the items were out of stock and then let you know they will despatch .
M	hdnl were apparently instructed to collect on 00th_jan but the delivery driver had paperwork that suggested otherwise .
M	!
F	i purchased other items from other_suppliers and was told their warrenties started from date of birth , as expected . i still have other items to purchase , as presents , but alas this problem will override my choice of seller .
F	i wanted some oils to massage on myself for muscle ease .
F	i am really appalled at the poor quality of both items given the prices .
M	having ordered a currys dishwasher i called to see about the delivery as i hadn_'_t been given a date after a week .
M	will_certainly use again if we need transport .
F	i guess we should have realised how shady the rep was when she turned_up , she looked more suited to a dogging dvd or lay - by than a classy hen_party !
F	slip , the boots were lovely just too_big , so had to return them , but it cost me 0 quid to return them to sweden safely , this amount would put me off ordering again as it all adds_up if you have to return them , the sizes are generous but i didn_'_t know that till i ordered and tried them on , other than that no_complaints .
F	this is the second time i have used this company and both_times i could not ask for a better service .
F	my order was cancelled without informing_me , so i never received the goods .
M	paid evans for an estimate for accident damage after crash .
F	i typed my registration_number in and it bought up my car .
M	the section on roi and analytics is less_than useful , and the test at the end seems a little bug ridden .
M	a quick and speedy delivery it does what it says in the advert a good family run bussisness with puzzles to suit all tastes
M	highly_recommended .
M	on thursday brackets arrived but to my amazement they had sent exactly the same brackets again !!
M	and then just two_days_later our chairs arrived .
M	i will stick to their whey_powder in future - as that is good valuable and very consistent .
M	i was very disappointed , as it was my first purchase from the site .
M	fast service and delivery
F	i '_ll definitely recommend this site to others and will certainly order from them again .
F	no cash_back by january .
F	an amazing quote for my old laptop , which i doubt i could have sold for more than £_00 online ( and with all the hassle of selling !)
M	but after their change to yodel i had to use another supplier as yodel are hit and miss at best .
F	the only_drawback i have had is at timkes the website to redeem certificates has_been a little temperamental .
M	delivery and packing was about the same as other online grocers i '_ve tried , but unfortunately the food i received was lacking in freshness .
M	the frame didn_'_t fit together that well and it required some brute_force to assemble it !
M	on the 0 of september_0000 i '_ve made my order for 0 products on this web_site .
M	the printer_ink i bought was a lot cheaper_than the lexmark products but i could tell the difference .
F	the item was bought as a present to someone_else , which makes it even more disappointing .
M	when i oiled it i then saw a seperation in the staves which is visable
M	everything was dealt_with speedily and efficiently .
M	very well_packaged , delivered on time and very good quality as_described .
M	most efforts to contact them fail !
F	i couldn_'_t have asked for more .
M	the company was obviously having problems with supply but never once contacted me to explain .
F	if you want to print your voucher like they tell you to do dont try because you cant
M	cheeky !
F	:-(
F	great carseat .
F	you need patience :-)
M	i found the whole_process to be very efficient and staff were extremely_helpful .

M	order was well_packeged with a speedy delivery
M	posted a job but them removed as job was filled elsewhere , but they refuse to refund my deposit !
F	all_aspects of the service were good , the valuation was competitive , the ability to print_off your_own_labels is a definate advantage and speeds up the process .
F	another week_later i emailed them and got the response that i should just post it to them !
F	bailgate apartments 00 bailgate lincoln ln0 0ap
F	i was most disappointed about this as it was a stock filler for my 00 year nephew .
F	disappointing service and i will hesitate to order again , particularly if it '_s an_urgent medicinal item .
F	bitchy and getting other staff into trouble .
M	easy to do_business with .
F	since then i have noticed a debit of ten_pounds each_month from our bank_account to a company called shopperdisc . co . uk .

M	excellent pricing and very speedy delivery , with great communication .
F	the whole_process was efficient and very professional with excellent communication_throughout .
M	only_downfall is the free_gift ( computer pouch ), no use whatsoever , the free pouch is more like a pencil case .
M	i gave it 0_weeks and called customer_services . they said someone would ring me .
F	this is deception !. and resulted_in a telephone_call saying that they could not deliver until monday
M	i have attempted four deliveries this week and had a friend stay at my flat during the hour_window in which delivery was promised but they didn_'_t turn_up .
F	card used - medium to good quality - not very thick .
F	deducting the taxi_fare from the saving i had made on the watch price made it seem less of a bargain .
F	i posted a review on the item to alert other customers to a potential problem - a day later it is still not showing , which has turned my dismay to distrust and disgust .
M	things have now moved on and such practices are unforgivable .
M	only issue i had was when i bought another game the following_day , then i got a email_saying fraud checking please send us 0 copies of identification , driving_license etc , i personally don_'_t think anyone should send this kinda information to a website that don_'_t provide there contact number and there address on there website ( its a 0 way thing we want to know your genuine too ).
M	cheaper delivery , briliant customer service and efficient deliery and excellent packaging .
F	they offer reasonable postage and package and delivery is super_fast .
F	i no_longer order things like berries ( had too many that were crushed ) or bread ( almost always mashed flat ) or tarts and pastries ( crushed ).
F	my surgery all went fine 0 years_ago with only an issue with night_vision , which i could live with .
M	after 00years with vodafone i will be leaving them asap .
M	you have nothing to lose .
F	ive called again today after a week of silence after [_name_] said she '_d speak to the supplier again .

F	unable to comment on them as have only been taking them for a week and at present cannot see any difference in my condition { osteoarthritis } but keeping fingers_crossed for a successful improvement .
F	i ordered an ipod from cash converter almost 0_weeks_ago .
M	they saw the problem and said they would report it 0_weeks_later nothing i made another phone_call and was told they would send the problem to the manufacture lg .
M	this website had the best price with fsat delivery .
F	the service was not great but it was the attitude and complete absence of customer service that was appaulling
M	first_class as always
F	we feel that this was not made clear to him at all and that he was in fact agreeing to something he was unaware of .
F	can only guess the driver had signed for it himself and put it through the wrong letterbox over the road ?
F	just by_chance i looked into the tracking .
F	has anyone taught them about health and safety ?
M	stuck by the company until my contract ended but when it did i moved on quickly .
F	we ordered 0 different trophies as employee awards with 0 different engravings but when they were received the engravings had been put on the wrong trophies .
M	where to start .
M	very pleased with service received .
M	very pleased with the e_- cigarettes at 0 / 0 of the price in the high_street !
M	i then went to set the tv up - there was no uk mains_lead , just a 0 pin continental_plug - i decided to persevere and set the tv by using a mains_plug i had , only to discover that the tv tuner was made for austria , germany and switzerland .
F	i was very disappointed .
F	bought this peplum as a gift .
M	we decided against having a coffee_table and were assured that it was no problem .
F	maxima are so efficient and i always recommend them to family and friends .
F	delivery was quoted as being free at point of order and to charge me £_00 delivery would suggest that the £_00 had been added onto the purchase price of the bike - this is not allowed .
M	you have had my phone for 0 week u promised to send payment by the 0 dec still_waiting
F	rarely bother to go now as i just know they won_'_t have what i want .
F	i pushed the button , spoke to the attendant , frantically_searched for my reference_number and then was let out with no_qualms , however , it was a wee_bit stressful !
M	i say thanks mazuma .
F	generally disappointed with our first villa holiday .
M	we used this woodstain water based to mix with a waterbased floorseal .
M	i bought two storage bags at the same time as the ones offered also fit the bill .
M	!
M	however , i '_m absolutely_delighted with it !
F	it was tasty & easy to prepare .
F	so i contact customer service .
M	i know the clothes are a bit_pricy but the quality is outstanding and so well made .
F	hopefully our men '_s first team will keep hold of their bright_orange first_aid kit bag this time and not leave it behind !
M	i ordered my laptop on line .
F	always check here for offered before i buy anything online :)
M	the quality of the items and the price will make me buy again from you .
F	i will now do my utmost to make_sure that no - one i know gives a penny to this company - i am ashamed to have sent my friend such an awful ' gift ' for her_birthday .
M	and pass the buck from one side to the other , and for the sake of returning a parcel you have now lost hundreds of deliveries from my company company name , it beggers belief .
M	freddie mercury x
M	if i were to order again i would be more careful .
M	i '_ve paid for a vw_golf , i received a hyundai that for makingkms is very bad .
M	the item was faulty .
M	well i bought a yamaha np 00 from ebay and it was supposed to arrive on thursday but it hadnt arrive so i phoned inter linked and said they hadnt recived the order so i phoned fair deal music and told me they had the purchase but hadnt send the order and said they will send it for tuesday week after thursday hoping it '_ll come
M	as a result , the fedex driver had visited an identical address in an adjacent village .
M	all attempts to get a response from the customer service department ( a contradiction in terms if there ever was one ) have gone_unanswered .
M	again , on arriving at the club , we weren_'_t on the guest_list !!!
F	after emailing them i was told on the 00th that it was yet to be shipped , yet a day later my account was updated saying my order was actually shipped on the 00th the day i originally emailed them .
M	cost little_bit more than off site parking but only waited 0 minutes for bus at 0am .
M	every transaction with them has_been smooth , fast and painless .
F	i told her i could not wait 00 days and asked could i have a refund , she told me that would be absolutely fine , talked_me through the returns process ( i thought i would have to pay for the return and was very happy to be emailed a postage paid return_label ).
F	that '_s when the
M	the quidco app is great too - shows you bargains and cashback opportunities nearby when you ' re out and about and even gives you money for checking in to participating stores .
F	however we booked a family room which said it had a double and two singles and when we arrived it had one z - bed as the single and no other bed available so one of us slept on the quilts and pillows on the floor .
F	superfast delivery !!
F	went_ahead with it once sorted and the eye_surgery_itself was grand , quick and easy and met lovely nursing staff in kildare .
F	my last purchase was for a clip on bed light , and this was one of the best quality in the price range - functional and good looking .
M	this was a tricky one as i am in portugal and the company is in the uk .
F	i would prefer to make a telephone booking , but not if i have to pay for the call .
F	better packaging might be a good idea to prevent this from happening .
M	would recommend this website to anyone .
F	great advice given
F	i purchased a product on 00 / 00 /_0000 and to this date ( 0 / 00 / 00 ) have still not received my product .
M	it makes the company sound dishonest , as if its proces are inflated to allow them to be slashed .
M	pathetic response from a pathetic company
M	the website doesn_'_t tell you what fixings would fit with that gate , which makes_sense as buyfencingdirect sales_dept .
M	if i needed it next_day then i would probably go_elsewhere , but otherwise i would visit here first in future .
M	just a hassle but return_policy is legit .
F	i '_m a o and it was j .
M	i '_ve finally resorted to emailing lovefilm '_s operations director , fern o ' sullivan ( fern . osullivan @ lovefilm . com ) directly in the hope that she can pass my complaint on to someone that can sort the problem out .
M	spot on .
M	highly_recommended online_retailer , their awards are more than justified .
F	this company came up as a good price using a google_search .
F	everyone so helpful .
F	the quality is fantastic and it looked exactly as i ordered .
F	never got my perscription and ordered 0_months_ago !
F	the flowers are delivered on time and in good condition and they keep you informed all the way .
M	product tastes good and cheap which is something i ' d about this service .
M	i had arranged to work from home as i had expected the delivery .
M	that '_s how i view ' pharmacy0u '
M	tried to contact the company and then the fun really began - complaints messages via the website are acknowledged and then nothing more is heard , call their premium_rate number and left on hold for more than 00_minutes and still no human_being to talk to - i am contacting my bank to recover the payment and if this is not possible i shall track down the company ( notice nothing on the website gives their postal_address ( very suspicious ) but there is always company '_s house .
M	therefore when i need new tyres in future i shall just call into my local_branch and take my turn , which i did anyway .
F	use a better delivery company , i don_'_t understand , what with all the choices out there .
M	the problem i had was that after exhausting available cars for that holiday_period , i found & booked an affordable car with vip_cars .
F	couldn_'_t_believe my laptop battery had died !
M	david : 00 : 00 : 00 gave tracking_number
F	to top it off they were advertising that if you ordered by that date delivery would be before xmas .
F	over all abit disapointed .
M	i e_mailed company & they did e_mail back quickly to apologise .
M	someone must be kidding .
M	great product , great company , great correspondence from_start to finish .
M	the delivery service was excellent
M	really good service , was quick and easy to use , saved me £_00 as got quoted £_00 before hand but so relieved i had found this site as it was such a simple process
M	item arrived securely_packed and quickly .
M	although there was no cost to me i felt that this should have been actioned more quickly and their quality control needs to be tightened up a lot .
M	there is a great range of equipment from numerous manufacturers , and helpful product comparison guides so that you choose a meter with the features you want , and don_'_t overspend on unnecessary ones .
F	items not delivered when scheduled , a chaser to customer service prompted a response saying that the order could not be completed .
F	the communication with urbis intimated that this was entirely not their problem as flight data is supplied to them , from london , by travel_republic . so it was my responsibility to arrange alternative timed transfers .
M	just as_described , on time , right materials , spot on .
F	i have used cybercandy a few_times , but find that the website isn_'_t very modern or well - organised .
M	!
M	the whole_process and experience is highly_recommended .
F	on the way home the instructions said call them when i was waiting for my baggage which i did .
F	never , ever again .
F	avoid talk_talk
M	but when i tried to log in using my aol e_- mail address and password , it would not let_me .
F	having already paid a months interest on it on my cc !
F	i can '_t recommend them more highly ; i '_ll never go_anywhere_else for writing gear .
M	excellent service no_fuss no bother good delivered in a very short time .
M	the manager , sean , should be_ashamed of him self .
F	definitely stress_free , easy to book , simple instructions , easy drop_off and pick_up , no hanging about
F	i would definitely do this again and recommend to anyone !
M	i had to waiting almost ten day for something the web_site said would be sent out the next_day
F	however overnight delivery actually turned into 0_days !
F	uncomfortable
M	i have a photo of the box i would like to forward to you to show this .
M	i tried to cancel , but without sucess as the order had already been dispatched ( and payment taken no doubt ).
M	however , getting the glasses was a real headache .
F	however , the failure to receive the product in time and confirmation_email of order , whilst the money had been taken from account , was disappointing .
F	i found the quality of some of the pictures not as good as others .
M	i ordered some flowers for my mums 00st_birthday some 000_miles_away from where i live .
F	i will contact trading_standards tomorrow and get this looked into as i think this needs to be checked out .
M	look out for the extra_charges they hide in everything and be prepared to spend more than you save at the other end when faced with a long journey to where you thought you were flying .
F	after 0 phone_calls to more than 0 member of their staff , it was agreed that the tyre would be fitted without me being present - not ideal !
F	the ordering process was easy and the information on the website was clear & accurate .
F	i felt exploited at a time when i was feeling at my most vulnerable anyway .
F	i have no_reservations_about recommending the site .
F	claimed vat_exemption but then still been charged it at checkout contacted company they said mistake on website and they would refund waited week still no refund emailed again this time ignored completly .
F	our information required was sent by fax and we were told that it was all ok and our account would be sent to payment .
M	tyre - shopper . co . uk is an easy way to order tyres ,
M	good enough , but needs a lot of website improvement - especially handling something as expensive as transatlantic_flights .
F	hostelbookers is better because you can leave longer feedback on a place and the feedback is sorted into positives and negatives .
F	my advice would be if they do not have any in stock they should state it at the time of purchase to give people a chance to find another_supplier
F	ish or game and controller for extra £_000 . 00 ish .
F	sadly , i often find i need to visit tesco afterwards as the stock is hit and miss .
M	it wasn_'_t much money , but it was distasteful and all trust is gone .
M	we '_ve now ordered from running bare instead - i suggest you do the same .
F	i have used beauty_bay a lot for specific products i cannot buy elsewhere .
F	very quick and easy service - thanks
F	i '_m really glad i used them and would do so again .
M	i phoned juno on the monday to see when the delivery was going to be made , and they said on tuesday via parcel_force .
M	i ordered the product on the 00th_may , it finally arrived on the 00th_june - not particularly acceptable .
M	try this company , super_fast delivery and my chair was just as_described and what i consider to be great value
M	as above .
F	although this is just one off the disadvantages to shopping online .
F	unfortunately i hadn_'_t actually measured & husband & trousers had " grown " by 0 inches .
F	very fast delivery , excellent quality !!
F	my advice ?
F	i was then told to go in to a store to get my new contract and phone .
M	meanwhile if you can ask your computer to cease making offers in the meantime i would be grateful .
F	i have no comments to add about the product on account of the fact that i haven_'_t received it yet !
M	ordered a netgear_router - they couldn_'_t supply at the price and then wouldn_'_t ( or couldn_'_t ) refund my credit_card .
M	i brought a car from trade_centre wales in may i was there for 0 hours waiting for everything to go through i was late for work because the kept me waiting i got the car in the end and traveled home the next_day i noticed that the windscreen had chips and a crack in it the gear box was banging and crunching the oil light kept coming on even known there was oil in the car the air bag light was on saying inspect so i phoned t . c . w about the problems they told me to bring the car back up so they could have a look so i did i was up there for about an_hour they came out to see me and told me the gear box is knackered i said to them well i now that but what about the other stuff and they said there is nothing wrong with it air bag is fine no oil light on so i questioned them and said so your telling_me there is no fault with the air bag even nowing the airbag light comes on and says inspect and they said yes nothing wrong with it so they told me to bring the car up 0_weeks_later to get it sorted which i was not very happy about because they are trying to let the warrrenty run out i then asked if they will pay for my fuel to get back home and back up as its not my fault the car is knackered they said no we dont do that which really put me over the edge i then said see you in 0_weeks so i then went to see the manager about what the mechanic said to me about the airbag like and all and he said he will get on to them and get back to me i said i am not happy with this car and want to change it remember i only had it 0 days they said no you cant change it even knowing they sold me a car that is broken i then questioned them on the 00 point check about the window and the gearbox as they put on there that it was all fine when it wasnt and they said it was fine when they checked it which i think is a load of bull i waited 0 days for the manager to phone me back and he never so i phoned a number of times and he still didnt phone me back so i reported them to trading_standards all i think they are selling dodgy cars i would stay well away because once you get the car you are totally f_** ked so stay well away they are useless and the managers cant even be_arsed to phone you back which just proves a point they now they have done wrong
M	lost my parcel . not concerned in anyway offered £_00 go direct to courier these third_party firms offer no cover of lost
M	you have to ' take a ticket '.
M	very smooth_transaction and good price .
F	i come home today , 00 may and there was an attempted delivery !
M	bought grips as per_usual and they were as always delivered promptly and correctly .
F	not having any refreshments for children was not helpful .
M	being a new internet user with a toshiba_laptop with 0 gb memory i was getting a lot of freezing , i have now increased that to 0 g and the speed has_improved immensely and although i ordered the modules on christmas day they arrived by 00 december excellent service
M	excellent service , easy from_start to finish , friendly delivery driver
M	i am so pleased with them , they are just what i needed at a price affordable .
F	i contacted the company several_times , and used the online_chat which was a waste of 00_minutes of my time .
F	utterly dispiriting service , like the worst of the0000s .
M	avoid , avoid_avoid !!
F	so . sales , service , customer service . terrible . but on the plus_side , if i had to pick anything , if ive_ever had a technical_issue with broadband for example , that specific team have been fine .
M	play . com offer some great goods at reasonable prices , my only complaint is the speed of delivery , it normally takes 0 - 0 days to deliver to worcester uk , orders form amazon also based in jersey , normally arrive in 0 - 0 days .
M	i booked our recent_trip to europe , dover to calais , return , out on 00 / 0 / 00 and returning on the 00 / 0 / 00 .
F	delivery when advised .
M	took old tyres away .
F	they said we weren_'_t there and i begged to differ .
F	amazing as ever .
F	when nothing turned_up after a week i contacted the company who advised that the website had been wrong and the item had been out of stock .
M	very good value for money product .
F	avoid this website .
F	perfect service , mobile sent and money received next_day !
M	when the part had still not arrived by 0 . 00pm i called again to be told that the part would definitely be delivered today .
M	when i did realise and contacted them i was advised they would take it the following month .
F	chased up by email and was told one of the three items out of stock .
M	other that that the website interface is user_friendly , nice description of the items , speedy delivery , unbelieveable packaging for a pair of headphone sponges ( i though i received a television ).
M	cash on the dot very helpfull good quick service what more can i say 00 / 00
F	awaitng your comments please !
F	none , that '_s right none of them were remotely minty in flavour and in fact one of them , the 00_ml mint frost , tasted down right nasty .
M	we also thought the sign directions were poor .
M	phone_calls went_unanswered , was told not to leave a message but email and they would respond within 00_hours .
F	this seems to have been brought in september_0000 .
F	i spent about a week back and forth with their customer service who blamed my computers and router constantly ( despite the problem happening on multiple computers and 0 routers ).
F	so on the 00th of december we again waited for the arrival of our sofa as promised and guess_what ????
F	i love this buggy so easy to push kids look so comfortable in it and colour is lovely cant_wait to use it for my new grandchild soon .
M	i left it at that , and a few_days_later ( after various token reductions in their fee demand ) miraculously they decided that they could make the change after all at no charge , albeit meaning both people travelling would be on separate bookings ( which was fine ).
M	its been three_weeks now and not hearx a thing .
F	i would steer well clear .
M	i immediately realised this on receipt of the confirmation and immediately rang ferrysavers to explain mistake , the lady was very understanding , but after a phone_call , she changed the booking but charged me £_00
F	i received very good service in the shop .
M	delivery was spot on , only taking a few_days to provide a 00 page booklet .
F	still ?
M	indeed , i have not even had a response from the store in question .
F	i sent flowers to my mum for her_birthday and the delivery , despite me saying that if no answer they were to be left with the manager ( she_lives in sheltered housing ) was left at the front_door of the complex , no attempt was even made to ring the bell of my mum '_s flat .
M	i have just placed an order with ebuyer to try them again .
M	price was better_than any i was quoted as well .
F	when i showed my disappointment she told me to forget .
M	often travel leeds /_bradford to malaga .
F	there is a covered area available which would have made the transaction more customer friendly .
M	i recently_bought memory from mr_memory .
M	your competitive_pricing is very attractive and i shall be looking further into it .
M	took 0 days to arrive in the end .
M	items are shown as in stock when they are not and unlikely to be at all from what i gather .
F	thanks again , keep_up the good work
M	expect sign to be clear on back window of car , be able to read it and see through it .
M	i first called on wednesday_evening to be told by an asian gentleman that i had to call back during british daytime .
M	buy from someone_else , you have the choice , don_'_t waste your time with this bunch of **** s !
F	i enjoyed the variety of experience that rickshaw offered through their booking program , and wish only that i had the time to experience more of thailand .
F	i bought a cap to send to my cousin , but during the ordering process there was no where i could insert a gift note , even_though the delivery address could be different from the billing_address .
M	i originally ordered the ripstik through amazon which showed immediate availability .
M	take a look at bmi '_s website should you have a sick child needing a specialist consultation : ' whatever your concerns or needs , you can book an appointment directly as no referral letter is necessary , by phone , fax or email - and there '_s no need to wait ', they say .
M	not good !
M	i done all the hard work , the hotel were happy to move the booking no problem .
F	the web_site is easy to use and the products available appear to work impressively .
F	as i said .
F	the job was done efficiently and professionally .
F	he said the customer service team would contact me that afternoon with an_appointment date .
F	quick and brilliant and reliable service , definately be using this service again .
F	the camera i ordered came the day promised , it had a few flaws in it but i phoned the company and the camera was changed by delivery the next_day . they were very efficient and respectful .
M	good computer , good delivery service .
F	" where '_s my engineer ". silence ." erm , he '_s not coming because there '_s a problem with your order ".
F	told me there isn_'_t nothing i could do or nothing she could do .
M	but the way it was handled was the best .
F	all of these things should have been put in on top of canned goods .
F	so i knew it would fit me and i wouldn_'_t have any reason to send it back unless it was faulty for any reason .
F	i thought he was apoplectic then , but bear with , it gets better !
F	unfortunately he forgot so i waited in all day on the thursday again , but still no watch .
M	i ordered a dell printer from them as it was the best price i could_find .
F	in the double room the mattress is about 0 " to narrow for the bed_base
M	i chose the kac electric plinth_heater 0kw as it was sold at a good price with free delivery .
M	i managed to find this jacket else where , but as a result of the late refund , couldn_'_t buy it as i didn_'_t have the money .
M	i will_definitely be using the site again !
F	but what a waste of everyone '_s time and what terrible customer service .
M	dave bertin
M	instead they have something which is over complicated and annoying .
F	so now i have to go out and buy another outfit !
M	good selection of stock , ordering is very easy .
M	quicker to phone the branch to book .
F	i ordered tulips but other flowers were delivered .
M	hilsen
M	tim cummins
F	not very happy i '_ve been charged nearly_£ 0 extra when i didn_'_t need these things .
F	delivery was quick and the sign looks brilliant !
M	he replied " fair_enough "
F	fantastic - cheap and they look good .
M	having made my order i was then informed that glasses i had ordered were no_longer instock and should not have been showing .
F	i then cut a piece of the seal required and wrote a letter with an explanation of what was needed and placed them both in the tube the seal had been sent to me in .
F	due to a martial split , which has_been explained to them , i cannot go_ahead with all of my bathroom refurbishment .
F	however , once i '_d paid , the confirmation_email said that the ticket was valid for the 00th of december .
F	the guy we spoke to was amazing .
M	i am suggesting mastercard consider the complete history of this company in the hope they withdraw its ability to permit them to take payments .
F	i recently ordered some christmas_decorations and they were good quality , reasonably_priced and arrived quickly .
M	disappointed with the site posted dates got the price up then tried to book it , on several_times to no_avail could not get through . but kept on trying finally got through on about the 0th try
M	overall .
M	i am reporting this company to the tps .
M	fast delivery .
F	!
F	supplier has ignored me and mighty_deals seem to be taking ages to sort this for me .
F	would recommend this company although this is my first time using it .
F	i was told it would be delivered christmas_eve , again nothing .
M	i ' d probably order again from the company in future though if these issues were resolved as my order came very quickly and the price is obviously a good saving .
F	i '_m not quite sure how it is acceptable to take someones money and then not give them the flights ?
M	poor design .
F	if i lived in a remote rural_location it might make_sense but a mile from the city_centre ?
F	the price was the same as advertised by janome but with free_postage .
F	they sounded awful and told me to bring it to a store .
F	i got a fiat_000 which , as you know is smaller .
F	i wouldnt recommend this company .
F	this was a little_bit frustrating , especially as it was important for my family and i to think about the text and wait_until the next_day or so to actually place the order .
M	great value and delivery timely and well_organised .
M	the delivery driver had departed .
F	i received a text and email at 00 . 00 on the day of delivery with no earlier warning stating it would be between 0 and 0 . unfortunately the messages were not picked_up due to working .
M	when receive it it was flat_pack but not understand the instruction to build on it took me hour to fix it is not bed it is for the guest who sleep on it
F	also , who puts a pack of six 0 . 0 litre_bottles of water in with oranges ( mashed also )?
M	never using again
F	brook_taverner '_s pricing policy is like dfs sofas ; you cannot be sure what the clothing '_s true value is .
F	they can '_t find my parcel when the status said they tried to deliver it the day before and i was home the hold day no ups , rang them i was promised 000_% my parcel will get delivered the next_day as i stressed it was important i received it .
M	what it says on the tin you get !!!!
M	still , it '_s all fine now and works_brilliantly .
F	one delivered was totally opposite , no ribbon that i could see to give it that traditional feel which i had hoped .
F	unfortunately i am not sold enough to stay with it and i have defected back to my old home .
F	they don_'_t say ' maybe ' as some other_sites do , they give a price that they really mean .
F	have used this site many_times .
M	next_day delivery and follow_up email to make_sure everything was ok .
M	0 network are the worst company i have ever had to deal with .
M	!
M	excellent service from online experience through to customer service support and amazingly quick delivery !
M	excellent item , well_packaged , great price and fast reliable delivery - can '_t ask for more
F	i '_ve ordered several_times with crownbrush and have mostly been quite happy with the service however the quality of the products can be very hit or miss .
F	steve maybury was the fitter and i am very happy with the end product .
F	i rang today customer service as parcel_force was meant to deliver my item today again they have delays .
M	00 / 00 / 00 updated - hermes are now claiming that they tried to deliver my item a third time at the last time was 00 : 00 , i was in until 00 : 00 , no doorbell_rang , no card left any of these soooo called 0 delivery attempts !!
F	!
F	it was easy to order items , received goods the day
M	surprise_surprise no reply at all .
M	would recommend to anyone .
M	not happy at all
M	arrived next_day as promised and mattress was as_described .
M	in the past you could rely_on argos to have everything in stock .
F	the order process is quick and easy to follow , and the delivery is quick .
F	the bow that was to be tied around them was just laying in the box .
M	i was told by the staff initially that all items where in stock .
F	they arrived and were 0 . 0cm smaller_than described making them unfit for purpose .
F	the soups don_'_t taste that good .
F	mandate is a scent he was given a few_years_ago and loved , but had never found in the high_street .
M	great service and very fast delivery , no_messing_about !
F	order never arrived .
M	so again we told the waitress and again no apology and again took the food away .
F	you mean the 00_% i used with my previous order ?
M	once i got to the patrol station i realized that in gran_canaria 0 liter of fuel_costs like 0 , 00 € or 0 , 00 € which is not as much as the car_rental company charged me .
M	i order a front and rear_light set , they got that wrong .
M	i '_ll update again once that '_s happened .
M	after_searching on the net for a decent pair of dj headphones ( possibly with a mic cable for mobile_phone use ), i came_across juno . co . uk reviews on their top ten dj headphones .
M	fastest data , least dropped calls and best coverage !
M	do yourselves a favor and go with a different carrier , 0 are a shambles of a company .
F	the hoover is great .
M	the service was the reason i went for the diamond_factory and i wasnt disappointed .
F	fingers_crossed , the carpet moths have been banished forever , but the sticky traps will help me to monitor the situation on a regular_basis .
F	i want my ££££ back !!!!
F	regards
M	if he had left me a note telling_me to look around the back , i would have been slightly_annoyed but happy that i had my £_000 motherboard and i may not have realized that my signature had been forged .
M	in an effort to smoke this guy out i asked a number of questions which a genuine seller would be prepared to answer .
F	if they go on sale , you can see it on your list , so bonus !
M	needless to say the company did not contact me after this review .
F	inside of a week the cheque was in my bank .
M	or hasn_’_t a substantial_amount of free time to endlessly chase their support staff , then icuk is definitely not for you .
F	easy to use web_site and fun products .
M	ordered a mattress from mattress world .
F	it '_s good to know the slate only came from down the road !
M	!
F	it is incredible that they are cheating on you .
M	order never arrived at work place before it closed .
F	di
F	i have just been speaking to her on the phone ( she is in uk and i am in new_zealand ) and she said they ' re beautiful , and so well_presented .
F	i brought 0 products at the same time , both whey_protein 00 , rocky_road and cherry bake well .
M	my order was cancelled in less_than 00_hours despite having purchase from there online store already twice before and numerous_times in store , apparently my card did not pass security for which they could have contacted me to confirm any details which i was happy to verify however they didn_'_t bother .
F	last month i ordered a box of 000 business_cards .
M	in summary . could not have been better .
M	good service and platform .
F	do not expect any such decent service from this company at any time .
F	absolutely awful service .
M	waiting for hours with no information then having so few staff who had no support trying to explain to everyone the options was very poor service .
F	when we arrived to collect the car i was shocked to see the queues for cars .
F	i have to say that '_s brilliant service and they do great sales .
M	i have no problem with 0 week lead times provided i know about them .
F	and don_'_t start me on the delivery !
F	once more my parcel was delivered to the wrong_address if a delivery man dont_know difference_between flats and house it is hard to expect good service .
F	i am_currently charging my phone via my boyfriends phone in order to have battery life from day to day .
F	at no time was i ever updated on its status over the 00 days i was waiting .
M	purchased sale items so a great price and altura gear is always spot on so no_problems there , as a bonus these_guys also use the royal_mail and therefor don_'_t suffer from the usual " variable " delivery service many of us have become_accustomed too .
F	i ordered my vacuum online - the website is easy to navigate and work with .
F	quick speedy delivery - what more can you ask for .
M	i booked us on a half board rate where dinner was served in a street restaurant and not within the hotel .
F	very satisfied with service and price .
M	best regards .
F	thanks
M	and this prolonged the installation of the new bathroom
F	easy to order on the website .
F	needless to say i will not be purchasing from this company even if the item i '_m desperate for is in stock with them .
M	or wait_until the following week .
F	i was very happy with the service , easy to follow website and the boots were delivered the next_day keeping_me informed of the time of delivery during the day .
M	thanks for cheapsmells !
F	i hasten to add no cards or anything left either .
M	i '_ve read bad_reports about poor service from delivery companies before , the likes of yodel and parcel farce , but these really take the micky , if you do use them and they let you down i told you so !
M	two or three of the prints are very grainy and appear to be very red , not sure if this is because the software automatically sizes the pictures and difficult to see on laptop when creating book as you are not allowed to view the book at actual size .
M	so where '_s my free upgraded flowers ?
M	the final pettiness of this company though has to be when you take the van to the fuel station .
M	sweatshirt x0 at esmall - miles to big
F	we got tenants that we were happy with and they moved in within a fortnight .
F	overall i '_ve been satisfied with physioroom in the past but on this occasion the freebie that was advertised for the mueller back brace i purchased didn_'_t arrive and there was some_confusion when ordering , initially showing free delivery and then adding a charge .
M	delivery from the company ebeez was delayed so i contacted them , i later only received 0 vacuum_cleaner .
M	i have no time to return and wait for the yellow item described .
F	avoid at all costs !!
F	unfortunately the box fell_apart somewhere along the delivery process and also a tin of golden syrup burst / leaked and left everything sticky .
M	communication was superb at every_step of the process .
M	i phoned the store and was told that the discount applied to on - line purchases and deliveries only , so i cancelled and ordered a home delivery , saving me money .
F	their prices are generally better_than tyre shops and obviously more convenient because they come to you .
M	when i got my purchases home they were fine and work really well , the multi is great for cleaning the car and they perform as well as the adverts reckon .
M	what more could you ask for ?
M	don_'_t buy from photoworld because the quality of jessops product is far_superior even_though they charge more - you only get what you pay for .
F	still no refund .
F	no problem , i thought , mistakes_happen .
F	yes i know i could pay for faster delivery . but why should i ?
F	hey , i can do something better he says .
M	they are very approachable , offer good advice and their online ordering service is very user_friendly .
M	why put your old_mobile in draw to be forgotten when clicking on mazuma and simply typing in your details can get you money back on it or vouchers if you prefer .
M	fancy_dress ball had a good range on their website and i was working in the halifax area .
F	this was utter bullshit , they realised they had made an_error with the price and wouldnt honour it , so come up with this rubbish about being sold in store .
M	0 .
M	without the secure key i have to call them to set_up any new payments , that i believe is fair_enough and did just that .
F	i had a few enquiries about some items i wanted to purchase and when i emailed partyrama i was answered in minutes ! website is quick and simple to search for everything you need to plan your party down to the finest details ! they stock a huge_range of products better that i could find anywhere_else meaning i could get everything i needed all at once ! delivery to northern_ireland was cheaper_than most_places and very fast and trackable the entire way from the order being checked to arriving at your door !
F	i rang customer_services the next_day and was
M	disappointed as tyres advertised & purchased were not available
M	!
F	we waited 0_months with no gas as we refused to pay over_£_000 .
M	overall speed of delivery , packaging and service was excellent .
F	finally , i called connect_+ again and this time was told that my parcels had gone_missing and couldn_'_t be found at the depot and was emailed another 0 claim forms .
F	possibly .
F	i now have them back and they are perfect .
F	i understand a small drop in the price but i don_'_t think that warrants a £_00 drop in the price , i argued this point on the phone but they refused to budge !
F	slow connection try to cancel aren_'_t able to i have spent days trying to get them to terminate my account still trying with no success
M	it was not until several calls later , were we able to talk directly to an engineer who , immediately , was able to solve our problem / query .
M	next . flowers for my partner .
F	can '_t get better service than that !
F	i sent my phone off but had a few problems with checkmend , fonebank were good occasionally on keeping_me in the loop of what was going on , but where i was meant to receive £_000 for my blackberry ive only received a cheque of £_00 without_any note or phonecall to say why they are taking £_00 off the price they said in the first place which i think is really unfair .
M	off we went boarded ship lovely room , had a drink retired to bed , noise from next door cabin ( party all night long ) never slept at all , next_day reported the noise to customer_services .
F	a trusted_seller
F	so all in all its good service but the dinners are a bit of a no - no .
M	you also get a clue as to what else you might need to order or what you may have forgotten to order .
M	when i '_m building a piece of furniture for one of my customer '_s i can always trust sds to have the parts i need .
M	i bought two tickets to england - france rugby .
F	i waited from 0am to 00pm on saturday and guy did not turn_up .
F	we had incidentally booked 0 quality rooms in a nice hotel .
M	dont believe in paying lesser for your phone insurance !!!
M	i personally believe this has_been a poor customer service and response to a customer who has spent in excess of £ 0000 at aria over the last 00 months all over a £ 0 000mm fan .
M	got a cancellation this morning so drove 00_minutes to the garage to be told they are so busy they cannot come out to see the vehicle and i have to book it in for them to look / listen to these problems and then book it in again to get any_problems solved !!!
F	it begs the question had i not have rang to ask where the item was would i have been contacted otherwise ?
M	i '_ve ordered about 0 orders form exante 0 have never turned_up although they did replace them but having to wait 0_weeks when on this diet before they '_ll reissue them is rubbish , a maximum of 0 days should be enough especially as they use a courier company .
M	great service , time after time .
F	if the order could be delayed by 00_hours why was it not despatched earlier to allow for this known and expected delay .
F	in fact untill recently i hadnot touched the site for 0_months because of this .
M	the package finally arrived half - way through the next_day , and when opened , to say we were both disappointed is putting it mildly .
M	when it says 00 tablets i certainly got every indication that it was 00 days supply .
F	can highly_recommend and will definitely use again .
M	it wasn_'_t until later i found out that they are the same company as mns automation solutions .
F	good way to find friends whom you have lost contact with , although i find it a bit upsetting when bad_news occurs and its plastered all over facebook , sometimes even before families know themselves !!
F	but it is the poor customer service to get this rectified that has infuriated me most .
M	i ordered a week_ago and am still_waiting for it to arrive .
F	we pride ourselves on our clear communication so don_'_t worry if you get plenty of emails from us letting you know how your order is coming along ”
F	i am so happy with my plug makes_life_easier should of got one sooner arrived in post very quick
F	excellent quality and size .
F	but sash '_s split after one wear .
F	postage was extortionate , 0 . 00 product was 00 . 00 !
F	during the recent bad_weather you cancelled our order .
M	contacted ballicom numerous_times about it over last month or 0 via_email and through their website , have been completely_ignored .
F	i can '_t be the only one who at this point becomes upset and somewhat aggressive .
M	sunglasses dispatched the day after ordering , and delivered two_days_later as expected .
M	to be fair , both items were delivered within a few_days and i was told that i could return the extra item .
F	no apology , just money off .
F	the best one i have had for a long time .
M	however when a problem arises where cashback is wrong or does not track , they are not really interested in resolving the problem .
F	very curt note saying , ' we are not supplying the tonneau cover as it is not suitable for your vehicle '.
F	if you try to contact them by phone they leave you hanging ( twice more than 00_minutes , with no answer either time ) and you are paying charges for the phone_call . they keep_repeating ' we value your call ' and i bet they really do - they ' re earning_money on it !
F	the keyboard had arrived before i got a text_message_saying that it was on its way - and that was 0 . 00 am on the monday after ordering on line over the week - end !!
F	we were told it will be another week or we can chase_up the courier ourselves .
M	i genuinely loved these_guys .
F	millys_store offered a very fastreliable service .
F	medicanimal provide the special_diet that my cat needs to prevent struvite stones .
M	it also seems that their reps requeue you instead of taking the call , i worked in a call_centre years_ago and know the tricks .
M	great service fast delivery a pleasure to do_business with and a great price as well
M	i ordered a regular pair of glasses and a pair of sunglasses as my free second pair .
F	never will buy with this website anymore .
M	thanks
F	it took a few_days for my order to be delivered which was fine .
F	haven_'_t opened and checked our goods yet but as they are sealed it would be bad_luck and not service to blame if there is anything missing / broken .
F	order confirmed and money taken .
M	i reply yes , supply my address and we agree a time .
M	i ordered 00m of lay_flat hose and a connector for joining to an existing hose .
F	i looked at my dreams paperwork and checked that i had given them the number .
M	do sign the on - line petition and assist what many others are doing by contacting the various consumer_rights organisations .
M	i have to say that i will never buy from you again , i will stick with wiggle etc .
M	i needed to set_up the shower room , so asked her to email instructions .
F	i can '_t praise serenata highly_enough .
F	definitely not recommending this company !!
M	called them four times to give them readings again . two letter form collection agencies and one final demand ( threatening to appear at my doorstep ) later i am still_waiting for my final_bill .
F	worst flight ever but not cheap , will probably never fly with them again .
M	great kit available on golfonline , easy ordering and quick dispatch .
M	they say you ' re saving 00_% but in fact if you shop around a bit the saving is more like 00_% or even 0 .
F	such is the inconvenience of online shopping .
F	the blinds are well made , it '_s just the mechanics of the bar showing through , which spoil the look .
M	found the goods .
F	i .
M	the result was that i lost approx 00_% of the contents of the cleaning_fluid which spilled all over the rest of the items in the consignment making them all soggy and destroying all of their cardboard packaging and any instruction leaflets .
M	i also posted the same question on their public_forum and got the same answer there .
F	product was well_packaged , i recieved the item well in_advance and the payment_method was very simple
M	the delivery arrived after an_hour and a half , cold and without the adjustment we had requested .
F	and waited , waited and waited , at 0pm decided to check the website and track my order , when to my surprise it says " your parcel was sent back as it was a duplicate order " huh ?
F	very good quality product .
M	by filing a chargeback in this situation you will be committing fraud and this email thread will be used in our appeal to that chargeback .
M	took my money and that '_s it .
M	now , tesco has more or less halved the rewards points , and of course airmiles has moved to avios at virtually the same time , and now passes the taxes that were once absorbed on to you .
M	two hours_later i have still not received a phone_call thus meaning that i will possibly have to try to borrow money to feed my family for the weekend and beyond until i can actually purchase my intended items from a different company .
F	it took them no time at all to find the correct strap and have it sent out to me .
M	mazuma is so easy to use and the friendly staff will help you all the way .
F	amazing .
F	my wee_boy wanted some xbox_live points and were meant to receive them within an_hour .
M	sure_enough , the manufacturer needed a prod to get it right , and sure_enough when i contacted lambda_tek about it they were right on it with their supplier to make_sure that the order was fulfilled properly .
M	a month had past and still no refund !
F	we are very happy with them and will use blinds ok again .
M	great product , fairly_priced , packaged well and delivered promptly .
F	great service , quick delivery and all for a very affordable price !
M	basically cheating liars i will not pay and will pursue them in court no problem .
F	would recommend buyspares for a good selection of products , offering good service & a prompt delivery
M	as always we ' re here to help
F	i was told my parcel would be made a priority pick_up on thurs .
F	i prefere i phone
M	orderd a north_face evolution tri climate jacket which was alot_cheaper_than the shops i ' d been looking in .
M	collecting an " on airport " car at stockholm arlanda .
F	let_down on dates .
M	i wonder_if he , the duty manger , would ever like to be treated the same ?
M	i posted the phone back .
F	;)
F	i ordered a starter_kit which was delivered 0 minutes after the start of a 0 - hour delivery window .
F	not too expensive either .
F	i got an_email on nov 0th to say the order had been dispatched .
M	now for the letter from the md and then my return letter .
F	i placed a bespoke order & will be placing another in the very near_future .
F	also some of the clothes sizes and styles are odd and it is best to try on stuff first to make_sure it ' hangs ' right , otherwise it is not a case of ' one size fits all ' as some stuff just doesn_'_t look right even_though it looks good on the hanger !
M	been here a while now never win anything , i see the previous comment saying you have too be in it too win , well they say they are new , wait_till they have been playing a while they will change there tune . i am always in but never ever win anything over 0o pound and very rarely win that . cms are ignorant have there fav all the time , same winners in ever game .
F	does this happen to everyone ,?. if so really inefficient process and the last thing that a traveller needs on return from holiday !
M	ordered december 00 and they arrived nye as promised .
F	i '_m really happy with fragrancedirect .
M	car_park exit - faulty .
M	a very frustrating experience .
M	great service but expected a better price for my phone
M	after calling the store myself to follow this up i then found it would be another week wait for them to get the cooker in stock .
F	if there was a facility to do this with your programme it wasn_'_t allowing me to find it .
M	i shall decide what action to take re .
F	excelent service on the door_step
F	thank_you
M	thanks very much buyabattery saved_myself a fortune .
F	staff very helpful but the person i dealt_with first had left so you were given a new email address who was on holiday then another person to contact .
F	my order was processed and delivered extremely quickly , even with engraving .
F	this i thought was disgusting as this was there mess up not mine and after demanding to speak to the manager ( who did not start until 00 . 00 am ) they told me they would get her to phone me back before 00 . 00 .
M	owner told me , the only reason he ' d signed_up to collect_+ was to make additional money from people coming into his shop and buying additional goods .
F	shoetique was extremely efficient and provided an excellent service at a very attractive price .
F	she did exactly that , and later that same evening sean , the store manager called to confirmed they now had my shower and i was able to collect it that night .
F	difficult to find filfar !
M	almost two_weeks on and orange send me a letter activating the account and the direct_debit .
F	in my opinion efficiency needs to imrove .
M	so we made the payment and were handed a simple payment receipt .
F	good service and great range of products .
M	i paid an additional £ 0 . 00 for guaranteed next_day delivery .
M	then i received an email_saying " rate your experience with your most_recent order " so here i am
F	this is excessive , and i shall not be using rentalcar again .
F	when i rang to sort this out , i was told that it was very clear in the ordering process ( in the price drop - down when selecting the delivery option ) at the timing .
M	i purchased the le bauhaus 0 & 0_seater sofas along with the armchair and i am really thrilled with the purchase , especially as my husband had reservations on ordering from the internet .
M	not available at time of purchase .
M	ps . i have never received any spam from rubbersoles
F	worst place i have ever shopped !
F	it '_s a totally_unreliable service .
F	plenty of room so he '_ll get loads of wear out of it .
F	when i called to express my annoyance that a ) these items hadn_'_t arrived even_though i was able to order them and at the time of ordering it did not say they were out of stock and b ) that they were a day late , the person i spoke to could not care less .
M	in the meantime , i agreed a far better deal with a far better iphone direct with orange .
F	the next_day i recieved the bag enabling_me to post .
M	but certainly the issue is now resolved_satisfactorily .
F	i plan to continue to use pet_prescription for a while yet !
M	i haven_'_t tried prescribed_drugs yet but maybe should as my dog is on about three permanent types .
M	bought a newly_released game the deluxe special_edition for over half the price from elsewhere , and i '_m really happy with my purchase .
M	i believe their adv .
M	out of all of the uk hypermarkets , i have to rate morrisons in the top 0 , they offer fantastic value for money , and the staff are a breathe of fresh_air .
F	!
M	the service was fast and efficent and the product was very well_packaged .
M	again - i hear nothing back .
M	the ' one way fee ' is a rip_off , doubled the price of my original quote .
M	or they cant source it below the price they offered it to me at .
M	in the meantime , she arranged for replacement tyres to be supplied and fitted by kwik_fit and booked it in for 00 / 00 .
M	so , in summary , a promising looking product , but from my experience , don_'_t expect any urgency from yale if anything_goes_wrong post installation !
F	i liked the fact that i received updated regarding my order .
F	er yes , obviously !
F	i had agreed for this to be delivered on a particular day ( friday 0rd_january ) but all that turned_up was the mattress and so i was very disappointed .
F	i e_- mailed them about this , but then of course they suddenly went silent , and did not respond .
F	we ordered 0 items for 0 delivery and 0 items for the second delivery .
F	ordering my christmas_decoration was easy and it was available for collection when it was supposed to be and i am sure it will look beautiful in my garden .
M	all queries i had were answered very quickly , usually within minutes .
F	now think whether i will have something here to order !
F	so he asks , can we have that in an_email , please .
F	excellent item with fast postage but it was a long_winded transaction on line , nearly logged off to try somewhere_else .
F	they arrived home after post_office closed on the saturday ,.
M	i also find their livedrive offering pretty poor on the mac .
M	they always have my lenses in stock .
F	i was sceptical but went along with it and low and behold it was delivered , as promised , to my home address before 00 am ( i think it was about 0 in fact ) - i can '_t really fault that - no q and no_hassle .
M	found that the quality of the product excellent , but i '_m afraid the way the dispatch and delivery were completed let them down .
F	just basically states it takes 00 days to issue a refund and i should contact them after this time period if not received .
M	with the d - aa , it isn_'_t easy to mix at all , i have stirred and used a shaker with this stuff and shaken it before use as advised and it still leaves what seems like a lot of the powder left at the bottom of the cup , this is annoying because it is consumed in 0 gram doses and missing a little matters a lot .
F	in the past thoiugh the service has_been quicker , and the products a little cheaper .
F	i only used this company twice .
M	strange .
M	great added_bonus on fixed price items like travel - rail etc .
F	clear and precise details of each item .
M	just annoying this company !
F	very disappointed !
F	after another 0_weeks the ladders arrive .
M	i was given contact details for my company '_s ' cycle to work ' rep at halfords .
F	yep , pleased to use aferry . always a good price .
F	excellent service . both recipient of .
M	if this business is not all out con outfit , then they operate on the edge of the law .
F	i feel there aren_'_t enough options in the layout either , quite boring layouts so going to start having these photobooks done elsewhere .
F	there was a small problem with one tee_shirt ( it was too small ) and the customer service could not have been better !
M	easy to find the desks and cars at the airport , nice modern car and at a reasonable price .
M	all in all , jennings_ford made it a painless task .
M	!
M	this time however was a little frustrating .
M	be very careful when moving to a new isp as this crowd dont_know the meaning of the word smooth_transition !!!!!!!
M	we are now trying to get it resolved they have so_far sent 0 different fitter '_s around but neither of them were prepared to try and put this right in the time they had .
M	despite sending a fully working device , i was emailed to say that my device was actually not working and i would receive a very small_percentage of that quoted when i sent the device .
F	huge_amount of choice and lots of greats .
M	ordered online expecting the product to arrive in 0 - 0 days .
F	easy to use website .
M	thank_you .
F	i booked a hotel through booking . com for myself and my 0 friends the cost when booking was £_000 in total so i took £_000 each off my friends , when i booked , the hotel took a £_000 . 00 deposit to secure the rooms / first night however i was expecting them to take the full_amount straight_away , this is not made clear on the website that it would not be all taken straight_away .
M	!
F	try asking one of their " expert staff " about the bike you just bought and they just look at you like you asked them a complicated maths question .
M	this is the first time i '_ve tried using them .
M	gardening 0 less was one of the first ads up so looked in & found just what we wanted , the bonus being it was on offer .
F	was charged for handset when it was supposed to be free still_waiting for refund .
M	complain_about this and you will receive no apology .
M	fast day of delivery .
M	but the use of the distributor is causing inconvenience .
F	i am happy to give you a 0_* rating now !
F	appreciated the email_informing_me of when to expect delivery .
F	the catalogue is comprehensive , clear and informative .
M	in 0000 it is unacceptable for a company in the channel to take money off a customer promise delivery and miss that schedule by 0_weeks .
F	booked sun_transfers 00_hours before travelling , we phoned up before booking to ask a question and spoke to an english_speaking person , who was very helpful and courteous .
M	checked account and money was taken out within 00_hours .
M	furniture choice got my mattress delivered on time and quite quickly .
F	good point - the company took my complaint seriously and replaced the mat and spring without_question .
M	( did contact you no one rang me back )
M	sent my blackberry after they quoted £_00 . 00 on website , emailed me back with revised_offer of £_00 . 00 due to excessive_wear & tear ( it was in perfect_condition ).
F	i am usually very calm when it comes to these kind of issues but this was the worst airline and worst booking experience i have ever dealt_with .
F	never fancy soup and the chicken cous_cous and lunch meals are awful .
F	easy site to look at and use - good description of product that was purchased - excellent price - fantastic delivery service .
M	couldn_'_t be_happier with the service provided .
F	all in all terrible .
M	i also couldn_'_t order from my local_store to deliver there and use the voucher as cex stores are individual franchises .
F	my first order they refunded without a quibble . my fault too not theirs !
M	på billedet ser man buketten til ca 000 - 000_kr , så hvis_man vælger en buket til under eller over dette beløb ved man jo reelt ikke hvor meget eller hvad_man_får for pengene .
F	yet little sad to see i have still had to pay the full_amount even_though i '_m not receiving the full advertised product .
M	i rang before ordering on line , to make_sure the mudflaps came with instructions and all the necessary fittings .
F	at around 0pm that day it transpired_that the internal brackets would not arrive the following_day and since customer service closed at 0pm i was unable to ascertain when the delivery would be made .
M	it ' seems that to travel 0 miles takes 00hrs , do you deliver with a tractor
M	if a slate_sign is what you want , i would look no further .
M	the site tells you there is an error or that its temporarily down .
M	i think the website booking_fees has to be cleared shown and not hidden in the taxes and fees , which are for government taxes , airport charges , airline charges
F	i had the medication 0_days_later .
F	they charge me full_amount and after 0_months im still trying to get my money back !
F	the package arrived in perfect time , it was great quality .
M	wiggle sometimes give you haribo i suppose .
M	two_weeks of no phone , having to call and chase them to find out what '_s going on and for what , nothing - i get the same broken phone back .
M	pulls threw the rev range quick and crisp
F	mage til dårlig service skal man lede længe efter !!
M	product arrived well_packaged and as_described .
M	once the order was placed , i was regularly_updated by email at every_stage of the process , including great communication from dpm the delivery people , who gave_me a delivery estimate for the next_day - not between_0am and 0pm . but between 0000 and 0000 .
M	printer was ordered at 00 : 00 on wednesday_morning , showed in stock and the money was taken straight_away so i hoped to get the stated " usually shipped same day if ordered before 00 : 00 " deal .
M	disappointed , i also emailed them and asked for a return under dsr - which they ignored .
M	have been using ff for a few_years_now .
F	i like the fact that they offer brands such as berhaus at very competitive_prices .
M	a superb experience and will not_hesitate to recommend or use again .
F	they are a scam site .
M	the communication and after sales customer service has_been very poor .
M	it was the cheapest on the internet by far and arrived very quickly , i wouldn_'_t hesitate to buy from these_guys again .
M	this is the first time i have used this company and i am very impressed . they keep you informed every_step of the way and i received my item the next_day . highly_recommended to all .
F	they do not handel parcels with care , i have received parcels with foot prints on , and i have whitnessed the couriers throwing items about in the back of vehicles .
M	email next_day to say the order was declined as my address was different to my postal ( uk ) address - they had still taken the money out but cancelled the order .
M	ordered it and it arrived within two_days
F	information given about the price during the transaction wasn_'_t very clear .
F	it was red to go with her new pale_pink coat which in my opinion would clash but on the day i could see that in fact it did work very well .
F	i had ordered a pair of glasses from specsavers after having my eyes_tested a week before ordering from glasses_direct but those glasses were not ready for collection until 0_days after i received my order from glasses_direct !
M	minimum wait time is 00_minutes on the phone .
F	we spend 0_days a week commuting on central_london underground trains , why do you think i want to go on holiday and spend nearly 0 hours commuting 00 miles ?
F	promptly called customer service and cancelled full order due to out of stock item , lady very helpful and said will pass on to accounts to refund .
F	basically meaning the sizes cannot be trusted .
F	payment was recieved a week from first contacting them .
F	a fortnight before christmas it was delayed until after new year .
F	so now i have a pair of trainers that won_'_t fit and even although they are still a current line they have refused to exchange them !
F	v disappointing .
M	we are delighted with all our mugs .
F	four_weeks_later i told them that while their website still said in stock for the item i '_d had nothing sent to me .
M	the vane is neatly cut out of a solid sheet of metal and evenly painted in matt_black .
F	i would recommend travel_nation and especially jackie to anyone traveling long_distance .
F	i thought breakfast was included and it wasn_'_t .
F	i launched the camera app one day and the whole app froze and nothing would happen , i restarted the phone and that fixed it , then two_days_later i was browsing photos on the train one day and it just suddenly shut_down and would not restart .
F	someone has_been in the house the whole time and no calling cards have been left either .
F	!
M	i have used speed_graphic for several_years and have always had great service - both in price and delivery .
M	thanks
M	it would have been even nicer if budget had valeted the car in advance !
F	would recommend
F	this was the first time we had use a service like this and will_definately use them again , very reasonable pricing very friendly driver was on time on both_journeys , what more can you ask for :_o_)
F	went_onto facebook to ask for an update , apparently a field was left blank so delivery could not be made ( my fault , which i accept ) - however , no contact from thornton '_s or delivery company advising me of this , i had to chase them .
M	no shipping or delivery instructions taken with order with the result that delivery was attempted but failed .
F	!
F	bought a car for my daughter to travel to university , car was four years old and cost £ 0 , 000 in september .
F	the trim is cut short leaving fairly sharp edge but it is on the underside so unlikely to cause harm .
F	i have emailed customer service this evening regarding my order flowers were awful and i was very embarrassed that my nan had received what she did
M	f . u talktalk
F	i have pointed_out to them that in the time it takes them to reply to my emails , a refund could simply have been processed .
F	got what i wanted at a great price on the website .
M	running my thumb across the home button , i noticed the first problem - it didn_'_t fit_properly .
F	lovely flowers shame that 0 of the roses had fallen_off in the box !!!
M	happy shopping with ' mytuxedo . co . uk '.
M	i '_m still_waiting my order . may be superfood use very bad delivery company . i spoke to the delivery company - ukmail , they rearrange the delivery for monday ( instead friday ), i was waiting all day . no delivery .
M	problems 0 or 0 times a year with missed deliveries or lost / damaged shipments - mostly resolved in the end .
M	i ordered 00 thank_you cards , printed on premium paper .
M	once i had ordered the part it was just sit_back , wait for the confirmation and estimated delivery date .
F	thank_you so much for your help
M	i had nothing to compare it too .
M	two orders placed in as many weeks .
F	i ordered two lamps which were in stock and was delighted they arrived so quickly and exactly as_described on web_page
M	i wonder_how many_times they have done this scam , as stated in previous emails i will be informing the police and trading_standards .
M	delivery was prompt and as predicted .
F	i was delighted when it arrived on very prompt on tuesday but unfortunately i had ordered the wrong_size seal it was much too small .
F	took two_weeks to arrive , but i saved about a pound .
F	and despite confirming on the day , the driver did not come to pick_up .
M	on the basis of this experience i would recommend made . com and am likely to buy from them again .
F	our lamp_table order was fulfilled and looks great .
F	the product i bought was far cheaper here than_anywhere_else and it arrived quickly in perfect_condition in a sensible amount of packaging .
F	great range of well priced products and good customer service .
M	very polite unassuming service .
F	price was cheapest online .
F	ordered 0 / 00 for 0st_class delivery , dispatched 00 / 00 , arrived 00 / 00 .
M	not all sites are honest & reliable .
M	highly_recommended .

F	our parcels have only just been delivered in the last hour so have not been opened yet for us to check them .
M	i tried to order the same part from bt shop . com and the part was no_longer available , they only want to sell you a new telephone !
M	nice clear website and loads of stock .
F	i telephoned and the company have agreed to send out another one , so fingers_crossed it doesn_'_t come squashed .
M	well , it has_been 0 days so_far and still it is pending confirmation .
F	fortunately thanks to a kind neighbour across the rd persuaded the driver to leave them at my front_door and he signed for them .
F	have always used interparcel as the choice of service and couriers is varied .
M	this was a sail forseen at 00 : 00
M	this is nonsense and i would not have ordered it from wex if i could have found the item with another supplier .
F	i ordered 0 chairs , all arrived in good time but one chair had missing screws and bolts .
F	wouldn_'_t recommend !!!
F	the lenses are so much_cheaper_than buying them from my opticians and they arrived withing a couple of days too .
M	please , if you happen to hit the jackpot and are among the chosen few who do get what you ordered , do not recommend this company to friends , yours was an_isolated transaction your friends will lose money , if in any doubt or subscribe to the conspiracy theorists , contact devon trading_standards or your credit_card company they will know de cuisine , you have been_warned !
M	currently working on a new flyer project for precisionsupplies . co . uk and will most definitely be using flyerzone once again !
F	i then emailed the company to ask why is wasn_'_t delivered to a neighbour and i have heard_nothing back .
F	the best part is when i open a new bag .
F	i would use viovet again anytime .
F	cats and i were surprised but delighted .
F	totally_unacceptable .
M	thank_you for listening ,
M	many_thanks i hope to use this service again .
M	the item was described as a helikon ecwcs gen 0 jacket , so i purchased it as needed a waterproof for the weekend , the jacket arrived within a couple of days which was a top service , but the jacket i recieved was a helikon - tex jacket ( not the same as_described ).
F	i feel_confident however that if i have any_problems in the future with the juicer that they will help me - they seem to be knowledgeable , reliable and responsive from the dealings i have had so far .
M	it took 0 times to book , was going to book with someone_else . plus price got higher on each booking
F	today is now wednesday and lo and behold no part has arrived .
F	in a lovely box too which i wasn_'_t expecting .
F	a lot of choice of items and competitively_priced
F	the vet said she had arthritis and recommend she take yumove .
F	now they have to cancel it ( it takes 00_hours ) before they can resubmit it for a new order .
M	!
M	order some items paid extra for next_day , 0 days_later my items turned_up , no refund on my next_day delievery charge
F	my son was also happy as he got the cologne that he_likes , and had a bit extra spent on his other presents .
F	i have used the service several_times_now for sending flowers to colleagues in different_countries / locations .
M	through email , customer service in animedirect couldn_'_t provide me any information and they said they couldn_'_t get in touch with the courier .
F	i thought , what the heck , i '_ve got nothing to loose and booked an_appointment for the following saturday .
M	at this price i can have different pairs or sunglasses and still get them cheaper then i would have for one pair on the high_st , great result !
M	this pack gives me 0 packs of isotonic , energy drinks & carb gels to try .
F	just the delivery let the whole_experience down .
M	as above as above
F	i ordered a throw from a company called urbanara for our new bed .
F	sent them a photo as requested but still not good enough - avoid !
F	every thing you need ie .
F	i bought and recieved my groupon_voucher for a vax on april 00th and my code will still not work .
F	they aren_'_t a bad company for getting stuff posted and they are a legit site , its just the fact that this is my first experience using them and its not taking 00_hours to reply like they say its looking more like 00 days !
F	sure enough , less_than 00_hours_later , my beautiful new front_door light had arrived .
F	not what i ordered and not discussed on the phone at all , this was a unauthorised sale .
F	it took them another week to tell me it was out of stock .
M	delivery is always on time and the product has always been as requested .
F	at this point i had had enough of forking_out for expensive phone_calls but still not getting an answer to my problem and cancelled the order .
F	it would have given me a lot more confidence in prestige_flowers if ; when you choose your bouquet and you are ready to order , the tick box for the boosted bouquet size wasn_'_t automatically ticked .
F	never had any_issues and hopefully lenstore will maintain the same level of service as it has so far .
M	although the costume was delivered on time i felt the picture was better_than the goods and the material looked heavier_than the goods i received .
F	i sent off my phone the same day and ( thursday ) and my money was in my account on tuesday .
F	we were surprised to speak w_/ other people who had been waiting for over 00_minutes .
M	the trading_standards officer went into visit evans_halshaw and emailed me the next_day ; ". visited evans_halshaw [ nissan sunderland ] this afternoon and spoken to aftersales leader and dealer principal about your complaint .
F	the price of the aftershave couldn_'_t be_beaten on any other site .
M	buy your somewhere_else !
M	again this was very cheap but i did have to chase for a couple of weeks to receive the re - validated survey .
M	and happened on this site .
M	and their customer service is second to none .
M	thanks
M	i ordered two bar_stools from atlantic_shopping from the great range on offer .
M	everything just as expected and arrived really quick .
F	even_though we don_'_t go away till august booking the insurance gives you that bit of relief to know you ' re covered .
M	they may have the cheapest prices , and do free delivery , but the order processing is slow .
F	may i add , i have not had this problem with any other company i have purchased from .
F	some products i wanted were ' out of stock ' for over three_months , whilst i was being promised they would be ' in next week '!
M	do not use , do not use !
F	avoid using orange !
F	so i will repeat it here .
F	the first posting is correct ( only wish i '_d found it before i ordered ) i spent £_00 on phonecase , they sent a confirmation , this was over 0_weeks_ago . everytime i contact them to find out where it is , they give me same ref that takes me to tracking co in hongkong . however no trace of it in uk .& no tracking to find . tthey will no_longer answer me & will not refund me . i paid by debitcard so no way of claiming back . avoid !!
F	never receive the form .
F	extremely reasonable_price and confirmation_email came through straight_away .
F	upon updating this review i will be receiving a revised phone price , and if i accept this will be paid into my bank_account the same day .
F	there was no water left in the container and the flowers looked ropy and 0_days old
M	each time the ordering_process online is easy , the response times are quick and the job is done efficiently .
F	in limoges you '_ll be told you can '_t have the one car they had spare because " someone might need it !"
F	!
M	no alternative has_been offered neither has an explanation .
F	took a while to re - bind and then had to squash closed to keep it bound .
F	delivery said could be between_0am and as late as 0pm during busy_periods such as valentines / mothers_day and my order was for mond 00st oct ( no special date that i could see ) i expected delivery to be sometime during that day , before 0pm .
M	!
F	ring the local_florists direct .
M	canon 00 - 000 0 . 0 non is
M	prices are competitive , delivers are secure and refillable and customer service were helpful and informed !
M	i then realised i ' d ordered the wrong item , so i contacted toolstop by phone , they answered quickly and changed my order .
M	when i looked for prices for my old phone , orange came up at the top of the list .
M	have tried other search_engines but google is deffo the best imo !
F	). there was one item i wanted that they didn_'_t have but overall very pleased with quality of items , service and prices so i and would recommend to friends .
M	i ordered flowers friday_afternoon for saturday delivery , they arrived about dinner time .
F	felt a bit_cheated as they gave_me a voucher number for free insurance and then didn_'_t have any way of redeeming it .
M	but when you visit yodel directs web_page you have no obvious contact ?
F	i am more than happy with what i have received so far but do feel that an explanation of the missing item would have been welcome in the package .
M	it spoilt the whole_process . and left a bad_taste
M	brilliant
F	finally my item arrived and it is only then i receive another email template from very , simply stating that if i have not received my order by a certain_date , i am to contact them again and they will investigate_further .
F	so hungry i eat even more fruit ( quite a lot ) than the book suggests .
M	i rang on sat as i could not purchase the furniture , only to find out the purchasing dept and online purchasing does not work weekends !
M	the shirt i received was excellent just what i was looking for at a good price thank_you
M	it isn_’_t messing up the delivery that ’_s irritating , well just a bit .
M	i wish i had .
M	0_star is being generous .
F	sadly our experience of your company ( with the notable exception of lee falconer ) has_been a catalogue of errors and extremely poor customer service .
F	my order was received and despatched extremely quickly .
F	and he was told that it was about to go to pre_- despatch , pre_- delivery what the eff ever they call it .
F	the wrong glasses sent but after a phone_call the right ones sent out to me by the next_day
F	next_day , tracked free delivery a bonus , items arrived as indicated .
F	reasonable value
M	it was nice to be kept informaed about when it was shipped etc .
F	overall they are ok
F	we fly standby a lot , so we arrive very early for a good reason .
M	we havn '_t actually flown yet , but booking and customer_services got the job_done without hassle .
M	kept telling_me there were " server problems ".
F	i have very mixed_feelings regarding this company .
M	the problem was i ordered a birthday card , the p_&_p rates being a little high , but not high enough to arouse my suspicion about where the damn_thing would be despatched from .
M	i have never used anchor_pumps before , but would do so again .
M	frustrating bureaucracy and automated customer service that can '_t answer your problem .
F	we stayed in a superior sea - view room , which was very large , very spacious , big balcony too .
F	when cancelation screen came - it has informed me i have requested a dvd title to be sent and until i return it , the cancellation can not go_ahead and the monthly_fee will be charged .
F	took two full months from placing the order to getting it sorted_out - unacceptable by any standards .
M	airport_parking choices and comparemeetandgreet .
M	they refused to offer me the phone at the new price and after many emails and promises i cancelled my order on the 00th_sept .
M	this was the second time for me to use fonebank , again the service was great , i was paid the full_amount_quoted within a few_days of sending my phone off .
F	took a phone_call and about 0 emails to sort it out - the colour i wanted was , by now , out of stock .
F	she_lives at flat 00 the orchard in a sheltered_accommodation area .
M	brilliant service .
F	v quick response & good value .
M	i emailed querying delivery date and didn_'_t hear back but luckily the trainers arrived the next_day .
M	0 ) bombarded with emails asking why i hadn_'_t purchased when i had .
F	future_bookings but was unable to do so .
F	i was keeping an eye on the tracking of delivery .
M	i then sent them an iphone_0s for a power_button repair .
F	!, the prices onboard were extortionate on the home journey we were in a different cabin and the beds were not much_better , but again no bottle of wine with dinner i have to say i was not impressed with the whole_experience
M	all problems were solved quickly , but would have preferred to not have them , but guess it would cost more .
M	this was the first attempt at online ordering but it turns_out i am in between your sizes for the coat i wanted .
F	staff were very friendly when i rang them up with a query and they emailed me everything i needed to know within minutes !
F	i don_'_t think i '_d shop anywhere_else - prices are very competitive , customer service is great , and the loyalty_scheme just tops off what is a fab shopping_experience !
M	extremely poor customer_services quality - worst i ever had in the uk .
M	i gave up and went to the belle vale store in netherly liverpool . after being refused physical points and showing them all correspondence of proof of purchase they managed to get hold of head_office who said they would resend the code with no offer of any apology for my wasted day or compensation .
F	found the product i wanted here cheaper_than_anywhere_else , fast free delivery , great service .
F	brilliant service and fast delivery
F	i rang to book for 00 dec and was told that no optician was available that day and i would need to book another day .
F	they are robust , well made and i especially like the fact that each light has a little plastic hook that can latch onto branches etc to keep the lights in place .
F	crushing and adding to food is a total_waste of time , they know .
M	i was told the manager was not at work , so i asked for someone senior to contact me back within an_hour .
M	i only bought one thing that had this cashback built in to see if it worked before i started buying various things to find it was a scam .
F	and were well_wrapped and just as_described .
M	buy somewhere_else .
M	goods arrived in a reasonable time with no postage_charges .
F	i found the watch my hubby had seen advertised on tv very easily on fcw website .
F	seeing as i have been home since 0pm then plainly he has knocked_off early to go home and have his dinner .
F	and they were cheaper .
F	perhaps you could offer a delivery cost as an option that would include unpacking and disposing of all the packaging .
M	i was very pleased with the mats when i received them and the speed of delivery also exceeded my expectations .
M	surely this needs to be looked at as this was not communicated prior to the delivery and makes me question how you are able complete the delivery of a number of your items and commit to the service being promised .
M	the max events day of activities was great although they decided on the day to not provide any lunch ( a bbq was described on chillisauce .)
F	i e_mailed the company to let them know my frustrations but no reply was received .
M	draw your own_conclusions .
M	ordered 00th , supposed delivery 00th , then told by parcelforce 00th , contacted both company and parcelforce ( parcelforce 0 times today by phone , twice by email , westin '_s line had switched to an answer phone by 0pm ), order finally delivered sat am , not to the right house ( yes we were in ), but 00 is close enough !
F	the concept of rentify is great , and just what i was looking for .
M	an_hour later , calls were being directed to an answermachine message and no online_chat_facility was available either .
F	i '_ve order a few_times from cheapsmells . com due to the great discounts one can find on numerous items , from hair products to perfumes and make - up .
F	my items were delivered quickly and in excellent condition so this year i wanted a couple more bamboo '_s plus a nice fern and so this is the first place i looked , they had exactly_what i wanted so have made my order .
F	would have paid double in the big stores .
M	the company has over promised and under delivered on just about everything .
F	very quick delivery .
F	took a while to get the issue sorted .
F	not sure i would order from this website again
F	i received an_email today confirming a refund which was £ 0 less_than what i paid .
M	a fiver to sit in a queue to try to arrange delivery and complain but yet you have to pay for it , how irate does this company want to make people , you pay for the pleasure of experiencing their ineptitude !!!
M	prior to charterhouse i used another mainstream supplier who always had excuses for late deliveries and the packaging was improvised .
M	so , in an ethical and moral climate , do you really want to do_business with people who exploit the front line workers ?
F	i was kept completely up to date as to where the flowers where in the delivery process .
F	i then said do you know which customer you are talking to and is it my stuff that has got lost or someone_elses ?
M	ordered an item on the 00th_december , the website stated that the item was on a pre oi rder status apart_from a few remaining in the size i required .
F	great product have used this before and it far outways the others for sale in the vets and it is half the price that you would normally pay for this tin also this only took one day to arrive just super service all_round . thanks for your great service i shall only use animal_direct from now on .
M	terrible .
F	just keep_up the fab work !
F	they didn_'_t .
M	the petrol needle was a hairs breadth below full - unless you are aware of the shell station , hidden away in belgravia ( sixt certainly don_'_t tell you ) then there is nowhere obvious to top up , if indeed it had been possible given how full the tank was .
M	every contact results in a different reason for the delay , and today , when i asked for my money back , i was told i ' d have to wait 00 days as per t &_c '_s .
F	good prices given but took_ages to receive the phone and too many emails were sent saying they hadn_'_t received it .
F	wouldn_'_t use amazon for an enemy '_s presents , wouldn_'_t buy anything from them again .
F	a couple of minutes_walk to the beach and restaurants a short_stroll away made it the perfect location .
F	the flowers were due to be delivered on friday 00th_march in plenty of time for sunday .
M	!
M	the box was but the console wasnt .
F	i was unhappy about this but accepted their assurances .
F	she '_d had laser_eye_surgery , as had most of the staff at the branch in newcastle , so she could tell me exactly_what to expect and made me feel really at ease .
F	i ordered a wii_fit plus board and just dance game on a friday_night and it came by courier tuesday_morning .
M	!
F	so do not_hesitate order now !!
M	better_than ebay
F	i ordered a dress more than a month before a wedding i was in and called regularly to check on the status .
F	saying that we '_ve had it a week , had 0 fourteen year_olds on it and there have been zero problems and the price was much_cheaper_than the competiton .
M	they even lie to us by saying that they won_'_t be doing it .
M	hello pete , fancy a pint ?
M	at that time the stock was marked " fast delivery on this item " and astonishingly still is .
M	!
M	with fast delivery no fault to be found .
F	good all_round service .
F	she then asked me if i was happy with the outcome , which i was not as it did not sort the problem as i could still not pay off my card and no one from customer service had called me when they said they would , she then told me she could not freeze the interest and my complaint would be sent to another department .
F	the item purchased was of a high_standard .
M	but - we had some technical problems & she always went off to ' ask someone '.
F	the box arrived with a big hole in the top and open , the pinata had broken on the bottom and had to fix it myself as havent got time to send you a picture when you migh not even replace it , the plates were also bent .
F	the person_who_served me , i believe the owner was talking on his phone and not once did he acknowledge me or speak he just took the parcels and scanned them , pointed for me to sign and gave_me the receipt .
M	i looked for my train_station & where i '_m was goin to ldn '_t find either .
M	they even offer to frame your poster which i found impressive .
F	i tried to make several calls today at different times with different_levels of o0 coverage and my phone froze .
F	donnadja @ djahotmail . co . uk
F	took my phone over to their office in farmoor as couldn_'_t contact them by phone , was told i would get it back the next_day . 0_days_later finally got my phone back and a yellow spot had appeared on my screen , it also warps if any pressure is put on the screen , tried to call them numerous_times , they didn_'_t answer their phone , have emailed them with no response . pants repair and pants customer service . won_'_t be using them again !
F	that '_s not the issue .
M	overall : good value , shame about the pushy_sales .
M	they have always been very helpful , knowledgeable and willing to help .
M	trying to get contact with the company is almost_impossible , they don_'_t respond to emails there telephone_number doesn_'_t work and seems to be disconnected .
M	was requested to send back the charger , which i did at my own_expense .
F	i am delighted .
F	i '_m fuming now - one of the items is a £_000 lens .
M	have travelled with dfds a few_times , from harwich to esjberg .
F	she is delighted with the appearance & quality of the product .
M	i pointed_out my online invoice clearly_stated i had paid £_00 to make it large .
F	and i begun to wonder_why i had allowed myselkf to be lured by talktalk adverts to change providers .
F	i thought having the groceries delivered to the door would be great as i work full time and my time off is precious .
M	i ' d definitely recommend them to lots of people i know looking for these products - including people i work with .
F	!
M	would i order again ?
M	like_clockwork
M	i asked for an email when available .
M	they are one of the most_important bookmarks on my web_browser .
M	the lady on the phone helped_me choose them and she '_s right - they really are quite bold and bright and i love them !
F	answered the phone quickly and very friendly .
F	i would recommend this site to all my family and friends .
F	now ordering the farm mat .
F	i rejected mazuma '_s offer and went with envirofone cos i thought they '_d offer me a better deal but how wrong was i !
F	i used to book directly with gulf air online after checking prices of same distenation tickets online . if i need to cancel or change with gulf air most of the time they charge me nothing . this time i have booked two tickets with e_- booker to fly on gulf air for an amount of gb 000 . 0 when i wanted to cancele i got penalized one full ticket price . ihe refund amount will almost gb 000_+ few_pounds .
F	the heel grips arrived via the postman in a small envelope .
F	great offers , very easy to use , clear information , cash paid with a few_days straight to your bank_account .
F	ebay ( where it was unfortunately bought :- customer protection - don_'_t make me laugh ) says because yodel tracking shows it was delivered , i must be lying so they repeatedly close my case .
M	i tracked my order by yodel website and noticed that the parcel been delivered so i started live_chat on yodel website .
M	i later contacted groupon who said they would refund me however been a lay person i took there word for it and didn_'_t check my statement .
M	fabulous , had everything i wanted , free delivery and arrived the next_day in the time_slot that they said it would .
M	not happy with my order , the first pair had one bigger than the other even_though they had the same size on them .
M	come on trustpilot ,
F	never again .
M	i was looking for a luna narrow 0 drawer gloss set in white and 0 small bedside units .
M	i thought i was paying for them when i checked out on rentcars . com .
F	thank_you castlegatelights , you have a very happy customer .
F	i have never ordered from this company before .
M	as you have medical insurance you are able to make an appointment with a chosen specialist .
F	i will be using your blooming beautiful services again , thank_you
F	they told me someone would be in touch about changing my meter , no one rang .
M	cannot find my address even_though we live in a major city eg manchester !
F	clearly the supplied charger was faulty .
M	the prices they pay are nearly always near the best available too .
M	i had a client whom i wished to thank who was located in germany .
F	no sign of him so i ring sky .
M	no replies .
M	out of frustration i asked ticketweb if they would be refunding the ' delivery ' cost considering they did not deliver them and i collected them and was told ' unfortunately , we are unable to refund your handling as the collection charge is the same cost as the delivery charge '.
F	delivery is fine but packaging is poor .
M	products were as_described , arrived early and was well_packaged .
M	then i found lockandkey online .
F	secure and easy to use
M	tried again and the exact_same problem still_waiting for it to allow to collect it .
M	the day before the last delivery date we were told it could take a further month to be delivered .
M	never seen anything quite like it .
F	so we decided to make our way to the o0 and arrived at 0 . 00pm .
M	i can only think that the couple of positive_reviews are written by themselves .
M	very impressed with your speedy service - good value too .
F	very inconvenient
M	disgraceful company .
M	apart_from that , good carpark , frequent_buses back and to the terminal .
M	if i could have left the stars blank i would have !
M	the current inventory is the new mechanism and hose quality .
F	this parcel was very important ( an_alternative wedding dress from very ).
M	i now remind them that they have failed to re - credit £ 0 worth of loyalty_points which i had used in the purchase and i then tell them not to bother with the points as won_'_t shop with them again till hell freezes over .
M	filled out a quick form , the envelope was here within 0 days . i sent it through the post_office and a week_later the money was in my account .
F	delivery is to my work place , their first ' no access ' was due to attempting to deliver at 0pm ( not in business hours despite company name being clearly_indicated ), the second was 0 . 00pm and i know they didn_'_t try as i was covering the reception_desk at the front of the building all afternoon and no vehicles came into our car_park !
M	recommend the company to anyone who_wishes to book long_haul .
F	i think go should have given more customer support to me - if i had not been able to independently contact bosch i would have been left with a product which i could not use and i had paid go £_000 for the privilege !
F	i have placed 0 orders now with partyrama and both experiences have been fine .
M	prompt delivery though .
F	i have just used this really good website .
M	muito rápido , fui bem esclarecido e gostei dos preços praticados nos artigos que comprei .
F	overall an easy shopping_experience , would shop_here again .
F	in december , car broke_down again , and was stuck on town bridge for three hours .
F	there was no phone number but a promise of a one hour email response .
F	i think that when you register a company with your website it states that all company '_s will be registered in 0 hours , however we have registered over 0 companies with you and we have waited a lot longer_than 0 hours .
M	well after 0 days fitting my 0 day job they have left site with a string of issues still to be sorted_out some small but some completely_unacceptable .
M	i was assured that we would receive a final_bill within 0 working_days for us to check amounts and pay debit off .
F	i look_forward to hearing from you hotelsclick .
M	ordered my first ever road_bike , prompt delivery and arrived as_described .
M	also get scoop and mixer_bottle on other_sites .
F	i find them as expensive as asda tesco newlook .
M	not had a single problem with them
M	once again i have had a very quick , easy and well priced transaction with cjs_cd_keys .
F	i ordered 000_pounds worth of shoes / sandals they took over a week to arrive , good job i wasn_'_t off on me jollies . they were well_packaged and the site offers a refund or exchange on any sent back , it will be interesting to see how long that takes ?
M	i would recommend mazuma to anyone !
F	keep_up the good work oak_furniture_land !
F	got home , realized i didn_'_t get enough blank cartridges and being that i wasn_'_t in a hurry , i ordered online .
F	i had booked a days holiday for this so i was at work when i took the phone_call .
M	its a great shop to visit too and they are very friendly and informative there .
F	i looked at various review sites and this one consistently got high marks .
F	i double_checked if it was my error in inputting details originally but it wasn_'_t . i had someone wait in all day to receive the order but it never arrived . it went next door !
F	brilliant - no need to go online and track my orders my self .
F	neve use them again
F	i was fuming .

F	i was thoroughly impressed by the speedy delivery of the paper_work and their complete efficiency in dealing_with the whole_process .
F	i managed to speak to first customer service person_who answered my question by replying a , then she passed me through to another customer service person to whom i spoke after another half an_hour who replied to my same question with b , then he said he would put me straight through to another person instantaneously , but not i had to wait another half an_hour and the third person then put down the phone in front of my nose !!!

F	it was just as well her neighbour saw them sitting there or she would have lost her flowers !
M	i ordered the tyres and booked the car in to have them fitted .
F	i smiled sarcastically while my dog flipped him off .
M	i therefore lost all of my money .
F	this is not the case nor are they interested in their customer_satisfaction .
F	also very understanding
M	just look at how many people have said that they will never use you again , or who want to cancel their contracts . still you do nothing .
M	++++
M	so i cancelled the order .
M	excellent service really looked after
F	fortunately for me as this was paid for with paypal , i have been able to open a dispute case via them so it '_s now in the trustful hands of paypal to get my money back for me .
M	it was easy to register and i got my envelope quickly .
F	!
F	however should have stuck to amazon where i could have got the same thing but without paying the postage .
F	!
F	ordered goods on 00 . 00 . 00 .
F	will not be ordering again .
F	so the service was not satisfactory in this respect .
M	i have been wearing dac tee '_s for a few_years and they last and fit me well and look good in the process .
M	i found the product easily on you website , ordered it and the next_day it arrived , with an email in the middle to tell me it was on it '_s way .
M	- easy to use website
F	ordered it 0_months_ago and paid in full .
M	i regularly buy from chaos_cards and if it had been a month_ago this review would have been 0_stars , however the website is updating and the changes might be minor but they are critical .
M	i also discovered preloved . com who , although doesn_'_t have the audience reach of gumtree / e_- bay i have sold product through successfully without the awful gumtree experience .
F	this was news to me as no card was left .
M	i ( we ) are not excessive drinkers but we know our g & t '_s and let_me tell you someone somewhere is watering your spirits !
M	very happy with the bonus for taking payout as amazon_voucher rather_than cash .
M	delivery not yet recived ?
F	it has taken nearly a week and my customer still doesn_'_t have his parcel .
M	website was easy to use , prices were very competitive and the delivery arrived quickly and was very well_packed .

F	lovely range of home wear , at reasonable_prices and comparable to what you would pay in the more premium end of department_stores , but more choice .
M	excellent discount on top quality clothes in the sales .
F	the company kept me informed all the way through the process of ordering and delivery .
F	in simple terms dont_waste your time
M	chair arrived very quickly and was easy to assemble .

F	will definitely use this company again .
F	i was ill and couldn_'_t get out but needed my tyre replacing at home .
M	i quite liked the product , cushion looking great but big fold marks through the middle of the face and prime areas of photos spoiled the look of it .
M	i raised a note . question regarding my order delivery , i ' d paid for the most expensive option and 00_hours_later still no reply , this is really bad customer service !
F	have booked with fhr before and will definitely use again .
F	the bouquet came wrapped with water in a gold box with a big ribbon round it that could be used to display the flowers and looked spectacular .
M	had to get builder who i pay to move into house so they didn_'_t get nicked or soaked in the rain !
F	but after_spending a few hours i sorted it out .
M	it is now the 00nd_march_0000 & first_utility have not yet been able to provide me with any bills for my gas & electric with the exception of an initial bill which was incorrect .
M	recomend to mates .
M	found the product i wanted cheaper at a different supplier , ao did not_hesitate to price match after they checked it it which only took 00 seconds .
M	0_stars is given for a acceptable experience , which ended with the promised product being delivered in the desired quality .
F	the customer service rep then went to check how long it owuld be before the glasses were delivered , and after faffing_around for 0 minuted was unable to give me any more information that 0 - 00 working_days .
M	all the more spacious ones were empty - for the entire flight - because they have imposed extra_charges on them .
F	placed my order at 0 pm friday and did not expect it until monday .
M	the control worked extremely well for approximately three_weeks then packed up .
F	took nearly a week to deliver and charged a fortune for the privilege .
F	will definitely use again
M	i have no_hesitation in recommending them wholeheartedly to anyone and everyone who_reads this review .
M	i bought another pair of distance glasses as well which are excellent .
F	i sent 0 business iphones to this company and nearly 0_weeks_later and after threatening them with legal_action , i have now only received 0 of the phones back .
F	it has not arrived .
M	it '_s a shame for her as she wanted wellies people would turn to look at , now she '_s panicking that they might do exactly that !
F	i was getting regular email_updates telling_me not to worry - my tickets were being tracked , they would be here etc .
M	one of the staff_members laughed and said " i wonder_how many other people we have ripped_off today !"
F	good quality products .
M	all in all i would class their service and stock availabillity as excellent and give them a score of 0 out of 00 and have no_hesitation in recommending them to everyone .
M	i phoned to find out where it was .
F	a design improvement could make these into elastic ?
M	worldstores make even bt '_s customer_support look professional and that '_s saying something !
F	why_bother going to garage and waiting as its always longer_than they tell you .
M	distribution was rapid and tracking even better .
F	i haven_'_t tried it yet but expect it to be what i expected and save me from embarrassing bush hides .
F	it backed onto a 00hr industraul estate .
M	used travelup because they had the lowest_price and the site was easily to use - found via skyscanner .
F	i '_m not sure i '_d shop with fluff heaven again but their offers are very tempting .
F	i phoned and left messages but no one got back to me either on the phone or through email .
F	wouldn_'_t order from the site again
F	got the original price .
M	ordered on sunday and were dispatched through ups on monday and came tuesday .
F	they have very few select items that are 00plus therefore i now have to go elsewhere and spend extra money al because they don_'_t cater for the bigger lady .

F	:-_d
F	was promised a morning delivery would happen .
M	after comparing_prices for the tour_de france yellow cateye_strada speedo , cyclestore always came back with the best value .
M	other_companies might charged higher monthly premium but at_least they replace your lost / stolen or broken phone fast !
F	the quality of the grain and seeds that i received was top_notch and even a bag clip was included - the packaging was perfect as well and the delivery very quick .
M	and matches the quality of the electric_guitar i brought a few_months_ago .
F	especially the non perishable parts
F	!
F	if i had had this problem before with the address then fine , but i have not .
M	good potential and resources . but just wish they would stop being a mouthpiece for the government and stop covering up the illegal wars committed oversees .
F	can_trust chemistdirect to deliver in good time .

M	only one item was delivered and the remaining two had to be chased up .
M	you don_'_t get that level of service elsewhere .

M	really good shopping_experience , products turned_up quickly and in good order .

M	it pays to shop around !

M	excellent after sales service .
F	the porters worked tirelessly and deserve so much credit .
F	this tracking email just said from the start to this end of this sorry saga " awaiting shipping ".
M	i could be cynical about the fact that they have put a lot of effort into creating a great website to take your money , but no apparent effort into doing anything after that point .
M	they goods are clearly_marked " 0 persons to carry " but this delivery service sent one man to drag it off the lorry , potentially damaging it .
F	not much more to be said .
F	i would definately recommend her services especially as they don_'_t just do honeymoons .

F	next two_days same thing then email_saying we '_ve not been able to deliver to you .

M	or we can get that down to around £ 0000 a year by accepting a £_000 excess each .

M	on calling and discussing with paypal they adised me they had recieved numerous_calls regarding escapade today !
F	i have been told that i have to send another photo and they will send out another box also wrapped in an a0 piece of paper because they do not have any wrapping for boxes of chocolates .

M	the customer service is good too .
M	i got the same price and found the whole_experience to be much simpler .

F	bought a voucher that i never received .
M	excellent communications .

M	0 ) if you are expecting goods check the items before they get in your house and refuse delivery immediately if there are faults because it puts you into a stronger position and you are more likely to get a replacement .
M	also i ' d like to see more japanese cars at the inventory .
F	their_database needs to be updated so people don_'_t waste their time .
F	i '_ve written again to complain but i '_m_sure i '_ll have closed by account by the time i get a reply as the service is just so appallingly shocking .
F	the flowers turned_up not long after i ordered , which i was very pleased with .

F	excellent product , excellent price , excellent delivery , what more do you need ?!
M	my problem with fatbirds ( apart_from the fact they made a mistake with the original order and failed to send me the replacement at all ) is that i was told things in e_- mails which were not true .
F	eg if you go straight to paypal , there is no chance to put in a discount_code - you have to go to secure checkout first and then choose paypal .
M	0_weeks_later i am still_waiting for them to collect it and refund my money .
M	0 ) i don_'_t understand this " hostelworld recommends " thing , why sometimes they recommends bad hostels ( about 00_% rating )
M	i have been offered no compensation , i have had my integrity questioned and experienced some of the worst customer service around .
M	their replies were always very short and cold .
M	un helpful , un knowledgeable , not having the time to help and expensive .
F	i placed my order on a monday and was very disappointed that the goods i ordered were not despatched until the saturday , a delay of 0_days before they were even packaged .
M	if the item you want is out of stock , but there is a due date on the website , don_'_t believe that is when you will receive your order .
M	we had a delivery of an electric_towel_radiator that had no brackets , after several phone_calls , sending pictures to prove what was wrong a replacement was supplied a week_later , strangely both items were delivered by plumb_center part of the wolsey group .
M	we get deliveries at work all the time and i just can not get over how couriers abuse , kick and throw packages around right in front of me .
F	biscuit isn_'_t the word i would normally use .
F	i would have liked to have given a better rating but cant really due to that .
F	was looking around for new bar_stools to go with our new look kitchen and couldn_'_t be_happier !
M	when it arrived and i opened the the beautiful presentation_box i could not have been happier .

M	over all great website and business .
F	ordered from purewell as cheapest price , delivery was quoted as 0 - 0_days but after 0_days my order still hadn_'_t been despatched .
M	well lesson_learned , local_florist in future .
F	i now use boots treat street instead .
F	the item arrived nine weeks_later .
F	i did think they took longer_than i expected to arrive also ( 0_weeks ) and there was no way to track them on the website although the confirmation_email gave the impression that you could , with a tracking no .
F	i '_m_sure you once operated a free return .
M	easy online ordering and rapid_despatch .
F	i can '_t fault them .
F	she denied passengers boarding saying she was driving the last bus and wasn_'_t going where they wanted to alight without offering them any advice , or alternative options .
M	it was quick and customer_services were spot on
F	i went to my local southall store .
M	saying that i have bought from other stores and had no_hassel .
F	!
M	outtstanding value for money more than happy with my goods .
F	was a bit_worried that the cosmetic_damage to my phone would reduce it '_s value , but i got the full_amount_quoted .
F	no_frills just fill in and go .
F	no - one contacted me to say there was a problem with delivery and it would be delivered the next_day .
M	however , its a shame they may lose customers due to a poor courier service experience such as mine .
F	travelling by bus to connection would have been easier if there had been indication of bus times on site .
M	i would advise anyone who was thinking of using them to not .
M	at first we were told we would sail on time ( 00th_june ) then further inquires at a later date we were told another week_later .
M	this time was no exception .
M	so i had a couple bags of d - aa and along with that i got a free_sample of complete pre_- workout watermelon and instant bcaa .
M	the price was good and the items showed as in stock .
F	!
F	however i paid more especially to ensure it was a decent_sized bouquet but in fact it was just a small bunch that could have come from a supermarket for £_00 .
F	just don_'_t do it !
F	overcharged when booking a hotel room with them .
F	i am thrilled to have joined the modern way of purchasing , but .
M	they '_ve even deleted the email address we had for contacting them .
M	good service , good product , good price !
F	well_done animed , second time i have ordered with you and just a smooth as the first .
M	each time , i had to find and apply my login_details in order to validate the friendship i thought they already had with me .
F	excellent choice of products and a website that provides the right information to enable you to make the right choices .
M	could do with some training of their telephone staff in helpfullness and knowledge .
M	for example , i received the lens on a friday , and i didn_'_t actually have to post it back until a week the following_monday .
M	would ( and have ) recommend ( ed )
F	the wool of the rug is very soft and springy .
F	i did not cause this mistake , so why am i paying for it to be fixed !?
F	this is the second time i '_ve_used serenata_flowers and i will defiantly use them again .

F	i '_m a little disappointed .
F	i would not use topcashback ever again !!
M	every year , around our_anniversary , we visit marlow '_s to have our rings cleaned and checked , and they kindly do this free of charge .
M	something should be done about them .
F	i was impressed by the speed of the service provided and the cost of the purchases i made .
F	they have even ripped_off several charity websites ( the hurricane katrina site is one ) who , by their nature receive a lot of funds very
F	have been a customer for a few_years but have noticed a decline in the time from order to delivery .
F	avoid like the plague .
F	a plastic cover from the door_handle had not been replaced and there was no fuel in the vehicle .
F	specs arrived back 0 week_later but still not a great fit .
F	pleasant helpful driver .
M	they say they '_ve been when they havn '_t
M	delivered next_day .
M	i '_m finding that i have to open cases all the time and companies are declining cashback for no reason yet are still being allowed to be on the site when they are cleary at it .
F	i ordered my items from pramworld and they came in 00hrs via_dpd courier service who are great as they text you with an_hour_window for delivery so your not waiting him all day
M	six days_later and still no returns_form so i call them again on the premium line .
M	excellent after sales service on how to get the best out of the kit . would highly_recomend .
F	each time the delivery came within a couple of days .
M	however , if you have tried twice to make payment online and it fails because of their system problems , they refuse to take payment over the phone that day and insist you have to call back another day !
M	i eventually arrived in port andratx at 00 : 00 a full 0 hours after leaving the airport ( it is 00_mins in a taxi ).
F	i placed my order on a saturday & it was delivered on the monday !
M	not !.
M	i brought because the price was good and said next_day delivery which made me excited , with the thought " great will be with me monday !"
F	ten working_days .
M	disappointed as one of the products is not effective at all .
M	not only do they make a nice drop of porridge , but the integral strainer on the lid and the pouring spout on the lip are very useful for smaller portions of veg .
F	long lanes of cars no knowing where to go !!

M	good range of stock , quick delivery and all at a goos price .
M	0 days_later i got an email_saying they wanted proof of my address before they ' d release the order for delivery - again for my " security ".
F	the annoying thing is that my husband was working from home that day and had they knocked on the right door he would have been in to receive the parcel .
F	and i '_d ask people to seriously think_twice before using them .
M	the delivery and collection of the lens gave no_problems at all , both being on time .
F	was at an ann_summers party as part of a hen_weekend near blackpool on 00th_may_0000 . the rep who turned_up was not the one that we had arranged , she was dirty and smelly and unprepared .
F	but it did fit after a little fiddling and was very snug .
M	i would definately recommend using them to anyone .
M	the description was relatively detailed , could have done with a bit more on the specific application of each model .
M	i '_ve since had emails saying that some of the items i asked to be quoted on ' have now arrived ' (?!)
F	" you should have checked the tickets " was their excuse .
F	no where on the website or adverts does it say that the 00_%_discount on first orders doesn_'_t apply to sale items .
F	can '_t thank him enough .
F	customer service is also great !
F	all games were good quality but i do not think they should advertise games that will take so long to be stocked .

F	i never received my item , my money was taken and i never received what i paid for .
M	the wardrobe is now functioning reasonably well despite the slight forward bow in the middle of the door .
M	he accused me of being offensive to him .
F	i have designed and purchased a large_amount of books from photoworld and have been really happy with the result of the product through the door , my only_complaint is that i had a code which gave_me free_postage when i tried to use it , is said it had already been used ?
M	look forwards to buying something for myself the next time !
F	members of family party booked resorthoppa for transfers from bodrum airport to turgutreis ( large resort about 0_hr from airport ).
M	i '_m_sure if i hadn_'_t phoned , they still wouldn_'_t have chased the order up .
F	i liked the flowers very much but not worth £_00 , which was meant to be deluxe , the service was very quick which i was very great full for as i left my order to the last min ,
M	i have been perfectly happy with ccuk clothing - but i '_m a cyclist who_enjoys cycling - not modelling keep_up with the jones ' gear junkie .
F	think of them as a very lucky find .
F	after trying to discuss this with hammonds numerous_times we could not get a call back !
M	beware . for the first 0 days we were there , the pool_heating was not turned on even_though it was included in the price .
F	i have still not had a response .
F	you can try , but i don_'_t think you '_ll find better_than this in terms of quality and service .
F	i therefore would not order from you again .
F	certain items will carry a surcharge to offshore and certain north scotland locations .
M	ta ta
F	easy , quick and fast delivery of an excellent product
M	* no despatch email
M	are from the dark_ages .
M	finally postcode accepted .
M	i suppose it '_s what you have to accept with choosing something online and not seeing it in person , so maybe i '_m being a little_harsh .
M	and it arrived much sooner_than i expected .
M	overall , i am happy with the end_result , and hope that 000 - reg value customer feedback and will hopefully implement these basic features in the near_future :-)
F	would use again .
F	!,
M	i bought a bright pink (!)
M	the cabins and ship was nice .
M	this experience will not stop me from using them again but i will probably phone unless the website is very clear about availability and delivery
M	although we were let off the shuttle close to our car and the driver helped_us to load our_luggage into the boot , we were quite concerned_about the apparent amateur nature of the whole_operation .
M	why is it blue ?
M	i arrived at designated store around 0 : 00 to be told they hadn_'_t received the delivery .
F	this made sense to me as i had paid mfd and not argos for the item .
M	loads more phone_calls to them and i finally thought i was getting somewhere on 0th_may after spending 0h 00_mins going through everything again .
F	so although go - electrical were good it would put me off ordering from them again .
F	a couple of days_later i came into my kitchen at the back of the house after_hearing a noise and found my item sat on my kitchen windowsill in the rain .
F	just received a photo , from my relatives in england , of the bouquet i sent for their 00th_wedding_anniversary .
M	the right_angled valves didn_'_t fit as the mounting_brackets for the radiator don_'_t project it far enough forward to allow enough space between the angled valves and the wall .
F	i dropped the parcels at my local collect_+ shop and they scanned without a problem .
F	don_'_t like the constant pop - ups on bottom right corner .
F	however , the fact that i then had responsibility of returning the unwanted grout myself really annoyed me and has left me out of pocket .
M	so if you place an order with homebase you have to do all the chasing .
F	they arrived quickly in good condition .
F	the wall_mounted drier is an excellent product .
M	nowadays newer titles are taking longer and longer to become_available .
M	also they give you the car full of petrol and charge you whether you use it or not , which is basically just a way of them making more money .
F	i enquired whether it was not normal practice for them to tell me about this , save us waiting for our food and they said they usually do but this one seemed to just slip through the net !
F	i was struggling to think what to wear to a fancy_dress_party , i hate fncy dress , but the unusual outfits i found here were superb , wud recommend this site to family and friends .
F	well she may have loved them but she didn_'_t pay for them and to be homest she was obviously just being polite !
F	0 .
M	i wear one of these brace '_s most day '_s due to an unstable ankle .
M	don_'_t understand_why the branch can '_t offer the free guarantees though if you quote the internet offer .
M	заказ собрали и выслали очень быстро .
M	classic , absolutely classic !
F	i just could get it in the post_office 0_days after my shop on line .
M	service was prompt , polite and efficient on the day .
F	hardly cheap .
M	i was nearly driven to distraction from the first email , i placed the order and when it was sent back to me for review it was completely wrong , not just an odd error but multiple errors from wrong sizes to missing garments , this happened over and over , even with the review of the embroidery problems occurred , and eventually i had to call several_times to complain .
M	the offers never seem to work for me , but other than that a good betting site
F	it could not hold a tune , wrongly spaced frets .
M	and so on the agreed date i waited . and waited . and waited . for over 00_hours but no courier , no communication , absolutely zilch .
M	first off , they don_'_t believe you .
M	i have taken four flights last_year with ryanair , two to portugal from doncaster and two to dublin from birmingham .
F	i asked if they would now send my original order as i had paid for it a month_ago and had waited 0_weeks to be sent the wrong glasses .
M	will use again .
M	i was annoyed but agreed to let them make the glasses up for me on the following_monday and post them to me first_class .
F	i must_admit i was a bit disappointed .
F	failed me completely .
F	when my order arrived in a very speedy manor i was again thrilled with your service .
M	i wrote perhaps 00 or 00 e_- mails_asking for the whereabouts of my purchase .
M	i won_'_t use rajapack again and i certaily won_'_t be recomending the company to my associates .
M	i guess if you were employing a plumber to fit then this may not be a problem but it required me to visit the local plumbing store a couple of times to get the required fitments at significant extra_cost .
F	apparently , normally it '_s possible to specify approximate delivery time ?
F	occasions ; but this time had great difficulty in processing the
F	unfortunately we are seperated my miles but your flowers arrived on her_birthday to show she is never far from my thoughts .
F	excellent prices , and excellent service .
M	at each location ( salisbury , stonehenge and bath ) there was time to walk around , although at salisbury the free time was brief .
M	he would not even charge me for it but i did insist on making a payment .
M	totally rubbish and unacceptable customer service .
M	i have had this response twice .
M	couldn_'_t help but wonder_if £ 0 . 00 was a bit low though
F	it arrived fine & with time to spare .
M	so i asked_him to call the driver to let him know i would be home in 00_mins .
M	delivered promptly , the mitts are waterproof and warm
F	however on contacting customer service they were very helpful and a full_refund and collection by courier for return of product was arranged .
F	when we arrived , he opened his boot , but my mother and her friend had to take their bags by themselves , he wasn_'_t even going out from his car , i didn_'_t say anything to him except thank_you , but now i wish i had said somthing to him about his rude , unkind and unfriendly attitude .
F	the flowers were amazing - so much so that the recipient posted a picture of them on facebook , thank_you .
F	i was over the moon with the 00_%_discount .
F	once again , printerland have exceeded my expectations .
F	march 00 made ​​ the order .
F	the message just stated that i have to contact them for a refund which will take 0_days to process , a refund for what ?
F	one of the shops didn_'_t even exist .
M	i have emailed them twice , in regards to my missing item and have had no response , hermes who delivered my item responded within 00_hours advising me to contact myprotein , as they will not deal with me directly .
M	it is no more hard work to produce good food as bad and i am really surprised how poor your chef is .
F	excellent .
F	first time i '_ve ordered contact_lenses online .
F	tracking the booking reported that it had not yet been despatched ,
M	goods in stock , prompt delivery , courteous in business and the best price on the web .
M	ordered a replacement charger for my icom airband , transair were the only company i could_find that supply these for my particular obselete icom radio .
M	no i do not work for ftt , do not relatives there , or have any financial commitments with them .
M	?
M	very quick dispatch and delivery - and stopped the ever_increasing wait for things to respond on my computer
F	driver co - operated well .
F	i had to change my original delivery date and had endless problems with the courier initially turning_up on the wrong day and then not showing up at all despite me comfy_living to re - confirm .
M	their customer service is a joke , search online and you will find numerous complaints , i think everyone with problems should log all live_chat end email correspondence ,( the only way to contact nowtv ) and send copies to watchdog , who will then do a feature on them hopefully , highlighting their terrible customer service and thus preventing future customers from signing_up to them and experiencing the headaches existing_customers are going through .
F	the parcel always comes on the right day , i get texts and e_-_mails to tell me its on its way , and the driver is courteous friendly and helpful .
F	it would allow me to put prints onto a page then shuffle them around into spaces that were not appropriate for the images used e . g it would put a landscape into a square place .
F	entirely unnecessary to have all the speel about booking on line , when you have requested that having booked , one still has to telephone for including a dog , it used to be at the bottom of the page to add at the same time and pay all at once .
M	i shopped_around online for the best all inclusive deal that included the new tyres , valves , balancing and removal of old tyres .
M	hide_behind what they claim is french jurisdiction even_though they are delivering into the uk .
F	i needed the ink for my business so had to order from another_supplier .
M	also there were hardly_any roses also .
M	!
M	really embarrassing , totally let_down .
M	it arrived on the day ( very early !)
F	i said to hubby , phone them up , and ask them if they know when the summerhouse is being delivered .
M	response to below
M	items not recieved
M	i never even got my money back on a watch that lasted a week .
M	i ordered 0 seperate items although 0 of the items had two of each of them .
M	as it was , the two rear_tyres were most worn and the obvious choice for changing as a pair .
F	we decided to sleep on it .
M	i recently was looking for a set of christmas_lights for the family and struggled to find them anywhere .
F	i thought this car_park had number_plate recognition , maybe it does but i didn_'_t understand the entry system fully and just pressed for a ticket .
M	interparcel need to be more careful about the couriers that they support , as ( was in the case with my customer ) the seller gets the blame .
F	only_negative couldn_'_t find number to call when had glitch ordering .
M	need i say more , good shopping and always a delight to spend money on bargains .
F	i was very impressed with the easy process buying online and getting my items delivered ( next_day ) and within the agreed time frame .
F	i have been customer to this company for years although their prices are good i have to admit their cigs is useless
M	i decided to build my own , but couldn_'_t find any suitable brackets .
F	had i known that this small sized bunch was to be delivered i would have used interflora .
M	i am in the same position .
M	you can easily see all the important information .
F	!
F	the website is great , very easy to navigate and a great sale .
F	they were also delivered ahead of time .
F	i will be using them in future , they have products at competitive_prices and really fast delivery .
M	like i have nothing better to do with my time that writing letters to them asking for my money back .
M	however , they will not stay in place in the shoe and contact adhesive does not work .
M	i received what i ordered , in good shape .
F	i then found out that the flowers hadn_'_t avctually been delivered and weren_'_t left with a neighbour .
F	there was plently of choice and the ordering was straightforward .
M	fast delivery and cheaper products perfect result .
M	you matched a rival comp on price , you also said you would throw in some firelighters free but did not arrive .
M	great idea for a range of food , regrettably not for us although we will sample from time to time to see if things change to better meet our expectations .
F	other than that , cannot_fault fhr .
M	amazing .
M	after travelling a short_distance the oil warning_light came on .
F	when i finally got assistance to order , i had to explain the item '_s specification to the assistant ( for example , she asked what colour i wanted , it only comes in one colour ).
M	it was only recently whilst doing my personal tax returns i noticed they did not refund me the £_000 .
F	i returned another item on the 00th and thats not even been processed yet !
M	to bad , and i would recommend everybody to think_twice before buying from them , if you don_'_t want to take the risk for getting problems if there is something wrong with the order
M	great price for pick_up and drop .
M	i was so impressed , i knew there would be extra shipping as i was in the channel_islands but as it turned_out the vat refund was more than the shipping cost so i woke_up to find a refund in my paypal_account already !
M	email : customerservices @ justbeautifully . co . uk
F	order it the afternoon before the party .
F	from_start to finish the process has_been simple , effective and a pleasure , will be back again for sure - thank_you :)
M	had to change delivery date by one day and had no problem with prompt next_day delivery .
F	my advise is to contact the furniture ombudsman if you too have problems with your goods .
M	i just wear a t shirt under the jacket and its perfect .
M	so they knowingly overcharge people and knowingly decieve people about stock ( that could ruin a late birthday ) and take days to repsond .
F	the p_&_p was £ 0 . 00 , which i had not spotted at the point of order .
F	we are waiting for 0 reading_festival ticket which is for thursday but its tuesday and no sign of delivery .
M	however , this happens a lot with pm and i do feel that they just try it on .
F	if you would like for the order to be sent sooner i can certainly request for some samples to be sent out if you would like to change the colour .
F	if you have ordered from them and your item has arrived safe and sound that '_s great , well_done . just check that it isn_'_t a counterfeit item and pray to your higher being that you never have to return it because it '_s faulty .
M	yo udo not have enough info about your products on the site .
M	ribble have stolen the lead now with cheaper pricing and a quicker delivery .
F	very happy with service .
M	would definately_use again , effecient , good value and speedy !
M	we were both tired and went sit_down for a bit before making the mistake of going to cafeteria .
F	initially i was told this amount would change at midnight - which surprise_surprise did not .
M	please reply eflorist ?
M	great service
M	on both_occasions their system flagged items out of stock .
F	very highly_recommended !
M	they were the cheapest online and so easy to speak to .
M	the item purchased has_been used regularly in recent weeks and is absolutely great .
M	couldn ` t believe_how quickly the outfits arrived !
F	i am so glad there is a shop like lush that has many branches widespread over the uk as there aren_'_t many companies that are eco_friendly and use natural products as well as working towards increasing awareness of issues and ethics across the world .
M	i can not find any fault with mazuma_mobile
M	then to top it all i have had to write to dfds on my return from holiday to claim expenses and i am still_waiting !!!
M	£_000 return , with no extras , except one piece of hold_luggage .
F	great price too - half the price of many other_companies !
M	there were many people waiting , myself for 0 hour 00_minutes to get the keys then arguments were taking place when people were asked for more money with not much explanation .
F	" we are experiencing high volumes of calls and the wait will be 0 hours 00_mins , your call is moving to the front of the queue " if you don_'_t have a hands free phone find somewhere comfortable to sit .
F	i decided to move from sky to talktalk a few_months_ago from sky .
M	after being given a sim only contract at a good price and assured that i could cancel it with 00 days notice with notice , i proceeded to use it for about 0 months .
M	we ordered a washing_machine and tumble_dryer in the same model and colour ( graphite grey ) to be delivered on the same day .
F	i always recommend this car_park and will_continue to do so ( in fact i '_ll be using it again in may ).
M	the system finally let_me complete on the 0rd day , however was subsequently advised by serenata , due to ' technical_difficulties ' the order could not be delivered on the date requested .
F	i called them again , waited on line again only to be told that they hadn_'_t managed to cancel my order , and it had gone_through and on top of that it was a miss pick .
M	very pleased with my purchases here .
M	excellent service and excellent piece of kit , very impressed
F	when i realized it , it was too late .
M	fast delivery , and never a problem from a few_years_now .
F	no i didn_'_t i had a cheaper mattress , there was no quilted top to it completely_different colour and it also said on the plastic it came in what it was called , and another woman '_s name on it .
M	a small adjustment to the layout of the ordering assistant '_s window would remove this irritation .
F	the items i ordered ( a bird_feeding station and patio stand for the station ) were for a friend for christmas .
M	disappointed to find that the total_cost of the order is hidden until the last moment , feel_cheated the original flowers were £_00 . 00 + £ 0 . 00 postage = £_00 . 00
F	when delivery men arrived they were polite , good_humoured and very helpful advising how to open the boxes !
F	i bought a memory_foam pillow and initially found it quite uncomfortable .
F	not worth the hassle .
M	however , when the tickets arrived we were not seated together as one of the tickets had been sent to someone_else and we had theirs .
F	great service
F	brilliant , easy service .
F	parcelforce would seem to be the antithesis of what the privatised royal_mail say their standards are .
F	they eventually reconsidered and charged me an additional £_00 . 00 .
F	no garnish ?
M	very dissatisfied .
F	i sent all the details on the monday , the envelope arrived on tuesday and the money was in my bacnk acc by thursday . have already_recommended to family and friends !!!!
M	i was in and out in less_than 00_minutes .
F	i am informed that they despatched my order on 00th_jan and it has not yet arrived .
F	terrible service
M	couple of things to look out for though ; when booking online some extras are automatically_added on and it '_s up to you to delete them !
F	i purchased beyonce_tickets row a .
M	they have refunded me the money and after my first post ( this is the second ) they have actually given * for free * the licenses that i was trying to buy (~ £_00 ).
M	slightly_wary to use them but the reviews on tripadvisor and other_sites spoke highly of them .
F	i have used serenata on several_occasions and they have never_failed to impress both for service , and lovely flowers will definitely be back .
M	choose what you want and go for it .
F	after breaking both wrists in a fall i needed two sturdy wrist and thumb supports to enable me to go back to work after_reading the reviews i purchased two aircast supports i ordered online and was very impressed with the speed and ease of ordering .
F	delivery was next_day .
M	i was searching the web for a gretsch mandolin ; various of the big - name web guitar / music - gear shops showed " call us for availability " but rich_tone showed one in stock ; price including p_&_p was no more than the other stores .
M	the recruitment team who are fantastic and helpful who are always on the lookout for jobs and opportunities .
F	less pleased with shoes not being the same as those in the picture on the website .
M	sagepay have a relationship with elavon in that sagepay is the payment gateway and elavon do the bit that puts the money into your bank_account .
F	my escape ladder came well_packaged and was easy to open
F	one thing as i mum i wasn_'_t wiling to give up was good hair products - the challenge was having the time and money to buy them .
M	i remember using this type of product in the 0000s on a escort mk0 , i searched for a couple of days before i found it then found several people selling exactly the same product .
F	i can_assure you that i never received a card through my letter_box on the first delivery so therefore dispute they had tried to deliver twice and subsequently never got the opportunity to arrange a different day when i was in .
M	the process was simple and the order arrived in a timely_fashion .
M	whatever i decided not to stay in and sent e_- mails to both companies .
F	have bought products from chemist_direct as they have what i need but the trouble is the space / name for the delivery address
M	shop quoted me when i called in
F	i was told i could call customer_services and someone would talk me through it !
M	i would dearly like to know the real motives .
M	we booked flights , hotel , and transfers all separately travel_republic gave_us a good price for the hotel and it was a smooth_transaction .
F	this is the first time that i have used this service . i was very disappointed that i was unable to phone the company --- the line was just dead despite them putting the number on the site !
M	sorry can '_t really review the flowers as they were not delivered .
M	despatch was first_class , very prompt .
F	if you want to spoil yourself or treat_yourself look no further .
M	i went_ahead with the booking .
M	!
F	the only_reason i got o0 in first place was shawn bean .
M	only saving_grace was excellent support from repairs team - but it took me 0 hrs and 0 calls waiting on piped music landlines .
F	where they do excel is in communication , your order is acknowledged_immediately by ' phone and email and later you are given a delivery day .
M	eventually i managed to make contact and all was resolved_amicably and in a friendly way .
F	it cost me about £ 0 . 00 at the post_office ( a free service was available ) i sent it on the thursday and the money was in my account friday lunch_time !
F	package did not arrive for 0 . 0_weeks .
F	that day came and went so i called only to be told that the item was short delivered and some deliveries were not sent .
M	i placed an order and specified a delivery address only for my order to be delivered to the billing_address which is hundreds of miles_away .
M	i finally received monies_owed on 00th of march but no proper explanation , appology or offer of recompense for all the inconvenience_caused !
F	their stock_availability needs to be addressed , although i am very happy with the items i '_ve managed to buy so far .
F	takes the hassle out of internet_shopping , no_worries with fraud , easy to settle problems and retrieve money x
M	as i can proof it through my bank state i am on a quite certain side .
M	if you want reliability and honesty then dont ' use frangrancedirect . com
F	they need to try a new courier
F	000000 - second delivery 000000
F	they arrived on the day but one of the blooms was already dead on arrival .
F	my husband told him that they either had a floor here tomorrow , next_day delivery ( which they offer , incidentally , don_'_t take them up on it , because their £_00 . 00 standard delivery doesn_'_t do what it says on the tin !
F	i '_ve never had glasses before so was new at everything .
M	also because they were literally the only company to focus on what they could give us rather_than what all the other_companies couldn_'_t do for us i . e .
M	i did this and cancelled the paypal automatic payment as well .
M	ebay has a dismissive and very ignorant policy against its sellers and encourages buyers to act in horrendous ways by instilling them with all the power .
M	they may be slightly_cheaper but the gain is really not worth the hassle .
F	they stated they had tried to contact me was a blatant_lie as i had been in the the house all day and had no phone_call whatsoever .
M	should be used by the general_public to sell used products .
M	i replyed explaining my problem .
F	we had a few_teething_problems with getting our ad live on these sites and struggled to get through to anyone by calling the rentify number to resolve things when our ads first went live they had let agreed across the advert which lost us a day - but once these few niggles were sorted , we had a great response from the ad and we would definitely use rentify again in the future .
F	contact notifications to let you know when your order has_been delivered etc .
M	did belfast from mancherster last_week used this service cost £_00 - did aberdeen from humberside this week - cost £_00 and i had to park it myself and walk to the terminal !
M	would not recommend .
F	had me worried for a while as delivery as a little late but when it arrived it was great
F	i heard about a company called simplysupplements and now i shop online with them , they are amazing the prices are amazing the delivery is amazing , customer service is amazing , so have a look at their website and you too will be amazed !
F	when i rang to chase it i was told it was out of stock .
M	i know where i will be going for my next set of tyres and it wont be national .
F	what i really like about lenstore is the re - order service , virtually one click and my lenses are winging their way to me .
F	however , something went wrong when i paid , the site said i had paid , but then didn_'_t follow through .
M	hopefully all back to the normal great service .
M	overall no real problems but nothing that makes me think they are amazing .
F	communication is always superb , customer service is how it should be .
F	also subsequent large purchase arrived within a few_days but i am still_waiting for my pretty cardigan !
M	for them to reply to my review - yet still not respond to my email , is simply unbeleivable to me .
F	very pleased with this company .
M	the team truly make you feel like you are part of there team .
F	easy to order ; quick delivery ; good quality goods .
F	the service was fast and true to your word . delivery was on time even thouogh it was the week before christmas .
M	myself , father and sister are all on full cover .
F	ordered later on wed & paid premium for next_day delivery ( assuming that would be friday ) as gloves needed for weekend racing .
F	the driver handed me my keys and disapeared without saying a word !
F	use this company all the time to order things for our office , they '_ve been great every time - really fast delivery , and great prices .
M	they have an impressive range and their prices compare well with other_sources .
F	my car was not recognised on entry but because of a line of cars behind me i had to enter taking the usual ticket .
F	it seems that <_external link_removed_> no_longer has a web presence / phone number / customer service / returns address .
F	i am still_waiting for my refund and wouldn_'_t be surprised if it took over the 00 working_days to get to me , considering the previous standard of service i have been subjected to .
M	i was happy about some things and not others .
M	00000000 .
F	won_'_t use this site again .
F	i can recommend using this company and would willingly tell interested friends how good they are and how easy it is to buy on the internet .
F	my goods have not turned_up so not very happy
M	terms and conditions or not it is still very slow .
M	so my advice to yodel , stop spraying your vans green and start reinvesting your profits into a good team of people .
F	it took nearly a year for the cash_back to be paid the first year , much longer_than the tracking statistics would suggest .
M	it cost rentalcars . com nothing except the processing of our payment and yet they still keep our money .
M	!
M	sky_poker is one of the best sites on the net .
M	the following_day i rang again and no such refund had been processed .
M	everyone seems to correct exercises differently and a guideline for those marking exercises would be useful .
M	i was very pleased with the service i got and with the quality of the products i ordered .
F	thank_you again !
F	flowers were delivered on the day required .
M	ordered a new ibanez rg0000z gw last_week online .
M	that was totally unaccepted .
M	i argued them down in price instead and eventually got the deal i was happy with and ( stupidly ) accepted .
M	i have been very pleased with the service and will always look to buy any electrical items first from them .
F	please_please_please don_'_t ever ever ever change !
M	all in all i will likely use and recommend jokers
M	no stars , for a truly ' diabolical ' ' service ' ???
F	i popped down to see the bouquet , and was horrified at what i got for the money .
F	enjoy the experience and getting cash_back .
F	so in short the product is good but the service / delivery needs to be improved .
F	we were very pleased with your service and ease of ordering ,
M	not only are the items poorly protected , visually the presentation is bad , everyone wants things to look nice surely .
F	there was no friction .
F	regards
F	ordering was easy
F	after appalling service i wrote an honest review of victoria_plumb giving them a one star_rating .
M	thank_you .
M	however , alpharooms fail to be up front when it comes to charges for using a debit / credit_card .
F	no packages , no dresses , nothing for nye , nothing for christmas . zero !
M	never received the product the first time .
M	they have cancelled and refunded in full - but now i '_m stuck without insurance and since i can '_t mirror the no claims i have to pay £_000 more - i wouldn_'_t have bought the van had they have informed me when quoting !
M	this time i was told i would not need a credit_card too pick_up the car .
M	it was fine .
M	if i hadnt chased them god_knows when i would have received anything from them .
M	the windows must have been left open .
F	it just stopped , nothing .
M	sent me the email again ( as i did not get the 0st one ) and when i received it i had to re - apply again .
F	they intimated that a time_slot would be available on the morning of delivery but in fact it was nearer lunchtime before we were informed that the delivery would take place between 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 - but that time we '_d already stayed in half the day !
M	i think eflorist are great , but you really messed this one up needlessly and the surprise could have been maintained .
F	rang the customer_services number and a kind lady said no problem i can cancel your order and you won_'_t have any charges .
M	the villa is situated on a private residential complex , sadly we found the neighbours to be aloof and unhelpful in terms of parking their vehicles over our driveway access !
F	got a text on saturday_evening providing a 0hr delivery window and a call on sunday morning to confirm .
F	get flowers elsewhere peeps !
F	00_minutes later * i should add that having read this forum i found out they have live_chat on facebook - maybe a good idea to advertise this on your site - the online operator apologized and assured me i will have a refund in 0_days , back to holding my breath .*
M	my first puncture in 00 years took place yesterday while i was in my local high_street .

F	absolutely love this site !
F	shocking .
M	upgraded hp dc0000 , simple and no_fuss
F	and the attitude of their employees .
M	i was told that as the machine was in stock at my local_branch they would deliver it the next_day for £_00 .

F	thanks drinkstuff .
M	its a bit of a hassle the first time you do it but after that it gets faster because it saves all your favourites or your shopping list .
F	he finally loads it onto the massive pallet and drops it on the road .
M	broadband was a very different experience , the lady in the store was a bit clueless and tried to sell me something that wasn_'_t in the system at that time - therefore not able to process a transaction .
M	a trusted site which always has competitive_prices , massive stock with majority of it always in stock .
M	have used viovet for a few_years_now as my cats need medication on a daily_basis . find their site very user_friendly and their prices a lot cheaper_than my vets .

F	all i can says : yodel you are useless !!!!!!!!!!
M	items were dispatched on tuesday 00st they were collected by parcel_force as normal checked track and trace because today is the day for delivery and turns_out my stuff is in belfast how can it get on a plane and to a different country without_any one spotting the mistake .
F	it was meant for a birthday_present and doubt they will be getting it .
M	thanks to all at power_tools .
F	the bottle of bubbly which was supposedly included with the offer was not delivered .
F	she ask me to book her a flight to irleand she is in her 00s she flew out a day before she cam home she was told that her flight was delayed and to go to the airport which she did , the person she spoke to said if she wanted another flight it would cost her over a £_000_pounds which was a lot so it was a case of stay in the airport or pay
F	went online and saw ao . com , remembered the catchy tv_ad and decided to have a look .
F	they then retracted this the day before they were due to be delivered stating the house was now " outside the delivery area " ( extra 0 doors up the street obviously make all the difference !)
F	the delivery was fine with good communication but the delivery people did not offer to unpack the item or take away the cardboard .
F	if they don_'_t arrive tomorrow , i will probably miss the last posting day - i will have to send 0st_class & hope they arrive in time for xmas subject to the cards actually arriving with me ,
M	.
F	easy to place order .
M	win_win for both of us .
M	hopefully the screen will be fine but i would expect an item that cost circa_£_000 would be treated with a little more respect .
F	the site will not accept my passwords , and their is no tesco store around the area i live , the nearest one being 00 miles_away .
M	the delivery was very fast from uk to germany and the quality is perfekt !!
M	what a lot of hassle trying to reedeem voucher for £_00 . 00 which was posted recorded delvery to their e_- commerce dept .

M	i was looking for a roland_cube 00xl for some time .
F	that said it did become clear after about 0_weeks .
M	delivered next_day and great comms
F	it was ridiculous , i was on the phone nearly 00_minutes on an 0000 number charging me a fortune and they solved absolutely nothing .
M	but one month later .
M	guess their nickname sums their business practice up the best , just substitute a word beginning with " sh " and ending in " ity " for city and you '_ve got it !

F	total and utter_rubbish .

M	staff claimed to be unable to remove wheel_nuts to change wheel but when i arrived at 0am miraculously all nuts came off easily .

F	i would not_hesitate to recommend this company to anyone
M	delivery excellent nothing to fault .
F	won_'_t be using them again .
F	i am not sure but i thought that viagogo is supposed to give delivery service my correct adress .
F	they took 0 bloody month to deliver a parcel from north london to central_london . parcel lost in transit , went via germany , came back in uk , lots of clothes stolen !!!
F	all of the above is also factually correct to the best of my own knowledge .
F	very poorly_trained salesperson .
M	if only all delivery companies were like buyaparcel .
F	i needed 0 red rugs so decided to order my smallest_size first to ensure i was happy with them .
F	and that '_s all .
M	the prices are very much average with little deals .
F	the free delivery model has not been thought through as in some cases it can make transactions even more_expensive !
M	ordered some chef '_s hats for an_upcoming party and got them within days - no_fuss , no stress - a good service .
M	very good product ,( small washing line ), excellent service .
F	i don_'_t think that the gift has_been value for the money spent !!
F	placed order for a halloween_costume and was expecting it thursday .
M	told in my first email it would be delivered in 0 - 0 working_days that was on the 00 / 00 /_0000 @ 00 : 00 am .
M	the whole_experience was deeply disappointing .
F	the online images were very accurate .
M	my brother said i can do better_than that , so back to the net i went , this time avoiding the companies already contacted .
M	fine little outfit but be careful with stroppy staff , if you nod or say yes to everything they tell you you may be okay but don_'_t disagree with what they say , it '_ll cost you one way or another .
M	it looks very smart and is very comfortable .
M	the guitars i bought were set_up well and chosen after trying several and are played regularly .
F	quick and easy

M	maybe a lawyer would help getting heard .
M	phone was received by them before the end of march .
F	i then needed to check some discrepancy in the details about delivery .
F	i don_'_t really find this an acceptable way to run a business , although the goods were fine i will probably shop elsewhere in future .

F	my fiance and i picked my engagement_ring from dg after visiting a lot of shops and not having any luck or finding anything we really liked .
M	my only issue is with the colour .
F	i was so impressed by the service communication and price !!!
F	very speedy first_class service and most pleasing - no extra unreasonable delivery charges to northern_ireland - well_done , will most certainly will recommend and use again .
F	i would like to point out , and this is not a complaint - it it is an awareness issue - my daughter is deaf , and she once booked a similar arrangement , but was unable to call and ended_up paying extra for parking .
M	chain used to have great prices with super slick delivery !
M	i have , since making the investment , which proved to be easy , had excellent service from the company and am satisfied that i made a sensible investment decision .
M	ordered some prescription_sunglasses for my holidays but from order to receiving them took nearly a month .
M	as a result , i have now been blacklisted and the correct form of action has_been taken against me for complaining .
F	i thought at_least one would be ok , but unfortunately no matter_how many_times i tried , there was no action , nothing happening .
M	i thought your products and prices are great but you could not forfill my order and my part order took to long to deliver but i will give you the benefit of the doubt and try you again

F	great service but this survey is already anoying me .
M	i ordered 0 humorous t - shirts from next to nothing '_s online store .
F	trying 0 cancel my contract which is up this month jan , stupid people .
M	with a bit more thought it could have been made with rounded_corners .
F	i ordered a hamper , paid the full_amount over the phone by credit_card , then received an e_mail saying i had bought it over 0 years , never even known you could do that , called them , you gotta cancel the first hamper , re order and your have to wait a while to get your money back .
M	on both_occasions i couldn_'_t find a cheaper price anywhere on the web .
F	i found workwear_express very efficient .
M	i '_m no fan of their ' discount card ' gimmick either , but the sheer range of goods they stock instore keeps me going back and the staff are always very helpful .
F	sorry tesco , but your web_site needs refining .
M	do not use this company .
F	however , the website search_functions could be improved .
F	this is the second time we have stayed prior to a holiday and taken_advantage of the airport_parking .
M	i have used indigo several_times and always get prompt delivery of good products .
M	hurtig_levering .
F	i learnt
F	the large postbox was at the gate , so no excuse as they didn_'_t need to gain_access to do this small thing .
M	i had originally enquired over the phone about the product and then bought online and was impressed with the free delivery .
F	she advised that there were no other pool_table available as they had sold out of them .
F	this has left me with a bad feeling & less likely to do_business with you in future .
M	l was adviced to reset my printer to make it compatable with your cartridges .
M	!
M	this was a great little feature and stood you out from the rest in a very competitive market !
F	i turned down this offer flat as it was not adequate recompense for all the inconvenience and stress suffered when we had committed to spend £ 0 , 000 with your company .
M	i '_ve only found 0 but there are probably more out there ?
M	over night delivery took a week and every tine i got in touch i was fended off with lies and promises that were always broken .
M	easy purchase system and excellent communication
F	i then chose to have them fitted ( for free ) whilst i was at work - this meant i didn_'_t have to wait a the garage with two tots in tow !
M	no courier turned_up .
F	i purchased an airbed from outdoor leisure direct over a week_ago and contacted them on monday to say that it will not keep inflated , so it is obviously faulty .
F	this is great place to shop . great prices and super_fast delivery
M	john_lewis , amazon , boden .
M	took_ages for delivery and it was only until i emailed that i was told that the item was out of stock and would be delivered when available .

F	i am totally confused as to why you have sent me flowers ?
M	dealt_with very efficiently by jafar in their customer_services_department who organised the refund without a quibble despite it being my fault for not checking more thoroughly before placing the order .
F	$_000 later i have nothing .
F	!
M	i wouldnt ever recommend them .
M	so i said that in the case then i will have to cancel my orer then wont i . there reaction was to just hang up one me .
F	i contacted customer service several more times for more information about how i can track my order yet have had no feedback whatsoever .
M	the guys delivering the furniture were helpful , diligent & extremely courteous .
M	we found the ny_pass very handy to have , and although we possibly did not make as much use of it as we could - in terms of maximising the potential savings - it was just as handy in saving time in queues , particularly at sites such as moma , top of the rock , and the statue of liberty cruise .
M	cheap - smells are not in the market place for cheap service , they show a quality of service which is found in but a few retail organisations this coupled_with a sellection of goods from the very best of perfume manufacturing houses for a female and male clientel .
M	some of the places have been very good and very low_cost
M	having promised that would be accounted for over the phone , nothing has_been forthcoming .
M	why not either a ) be jumped upon by the hawking sales staff when you look to be busy looking at something or b ) find nobody in sight when you need assistance ?
M	paid over £ 0000 for a cooker / hood / splashback , waited almost a week for confirmation of when the cooker would be in stock ( after being told i would get a call back the day after i had placed the order ).
F	thanks !
M	usually have no_problems with serenata so i won_'_t judge on this occasion , just a pity it was valentines_day roses when the standard slipped .
F	i was pleased to be kept in touch with progress of the order .
F	it is in fact extortion !
M	they insisted that i would have to wait in " the queue " but must have felt_guilty at messing me around and mysteriously they could fit my tyre in about 0 minutes !
M	spending 00_minutes waiting for someone to answer my call , an indian lass answered , citing a ' delay ' in getting it dispatched , as if it were a valid excuse .
F	i don_'_t understand_why we are totally_ripped_off by the exorbitant prices on borad or food and drinks .
F	but to end on a positive , you have great products and i look_forward to receiving your 0000 christmas catalogue next year where i know i will find plenty of products my children will enjoy .
M	the glasses were dispatched on the wednesday , and actually arrived on the thursday - which is very good .
F	cafe is handy , some branches better_than others .
F	also , it lost the element of surprise as i phoned her and asked if she liked her present .
F	it does all it says it does .
F	i was given time to inspect and test_drive the car to make_sure that i was making the right_decision for me , nothing was too much_trouble .
F	had we cancelled with less_than seven_days ’ notice we would have been penalised £_000 .
F	the wood was not smoothed and had flaky / spiky bits of wood stuck out .
F	i '_ve ordered several items from a well_known company for business advertisement .
F	the manager told lee the company would pay for electrical works to move the switch , however , lee managed to get around this although the wardrobe_doors overlap more than they should .
F	since then we have ordered once again with the great fast service with emails to let you know about delivery time .
M	no_hassle , just plain quick deliverly .
F	hi , i found the inability for your system to accept my credit_card exceptionally frustrating .
F	the product finally arrived after 0pm in the evening just as i was about to leave the office , so i almost didn_'_t get my delivery and i couldn_'_t access anyone or any info to chase it up - it wasn_'_t worth the extra_cost .
M	offer was honoured and payment was made within their stated time .
F	easy to use , only takes a few_minutes to look up and use . good incentives .
F	this item is antique , rare , irreplaceable , fragile , lost !
F	funny though how their sales_department phone line is never busy !!!
M	competitive price , kept me informed , well_packaged and delivered promptly .
M	i had thought that by making an online booking i would have been fitted in straight_away without the wait .
M	everything used to be in stock , but just recently many things i needed were not available .
F	i didn_'_t experience problems like one reviewer thoughwho didn_'_t receive accessories with a phone , i did , but here is a company that definitely does lack in a few areas .
F	so a few superfisal marks should be expected .
F	i spoke to her again today , just 0_days after delivery and she told me she was going to have to throw them out soon as they were looking sorry for themselves .
M	nice flowers delivered fast and free .
F	so i had no cause for concern as to where things were in the process .

F	i am still_waiting for that call back .
M	order and delivery as advertised .
F	email has always been my only form on contact as i live in england .
M	two minutes on aferry . co . uk , the right route was found and 0 minutes later we were booked and the confirmation e_- mail was in my in - box .

F	flowers weren_'_t delivered , unable to contact them via phone .
F	interparcel are delivering this chair and its memories for a grand_total of £_00 . 00 .
F	i '_m a little disappointed !
M	i thought at these prices the quality might not be good , how wrong was i . the service and communication with worktop_express was excellent and two friendly delivery men as well .
M	it was very satisfying to receive such a well prepared for transportation parcel , care in the way it was packed was noted , thanks !
M	i have had no reply or refund .
F	on one occasion i held on for 00_minutes then got cut_off
F	delivery guys told me that i own x amount money and i have to pay now otherwise i can '_t keep the sofa .
F	the whole_process was unprofessional , badly managed and a complete_waste of my time and money .
F	there was almost no information about where to go except to the other terminal .
M	they have failed to respond to all the issues i raised in an email to them .
F	when my partner advised that this would not be convenient due to his working hours , he was basically told tough_luck .
F	watch arrived exactly as advertised , couldn_'_t be_happier and will certainly be using this company again .
M	senders be aware . be very aware . use a different postage option . as the couriers have no gumption to think out of the bubble .
F	we had called on the second day , and been called back , with an explanation and an assurance , but it would have been better if this info had been volunteered rather_than us having to enquire .
M	never again !!
F	!
F	i thought this was a bit short as the other meats had much longer .
M	fast , friendly and efficient - no_problems .
M	would recommend to everyone .
F	i lost 0 parcels which stated it was delivered to me .

F	loved the invites , great quality but i ended_up having to scrap the first set and order further copies as they had 0000 as the year instead of 0000 in 0 separate places .
F	the earrings that my husband brought me were to match the necklace ( now that was altered ).
M	fantastic .
F	i will not bother next time !
F	" yes dear , i know " i said , " i '_ve called you before and it '_s already been over a week since you signed for my parcel which is a bit over your 0 day rule , so where is my refund ?"
M	i put on my old specs and guess_what i could see perfect and without glasses i get ghosting i also get wicked dry_eye '_s i told this to the optomerist and he said thats just because he had been messing_around with my eye '_s .
M	my daughter went back to test_drive the polo as she was going to buy it if the test_drive went well .

F	an exchange was dealt_with free of charge and just as quickly .
M	the overall quality of the album was excellent .

M	entertaining guides with different_styles .
F	spent fifty pound on a voucher , could not contact vendor to redeem .

M	after the ensuing debate - it was agreed dpd would deliver the second box this saturday_morning ( for free rather_than have to pay a further £_00 ), which has just arrived at last .
F	they were delivered less_than a week after order .
M	however the delivery didn_'_t show up so after a telephone_conversation the next_morning i was assured that the problem was just the amount of xmas deliveries and that the delivery would be made that day .
F	it is fine to have cheap prices , but i would rather pay more to have the confidence that any_problems will be dealt_with satisfactorily .
F	other than that it seems ok .
M	i hope talk_talk will live up to my expectations and the assurances to that end given by your customer service operative .

F	great website , easy to use , and very quick delivery

F	although i have not seen them myself i was told they were amazing and absolutely_stunning .
M	and they use swiftcover . com which is an terrible insurance company .
F	however , when i called with a relatively simple question about flow and return temperatures , no one was really able to answer my question .

M	so i called back after 00 , told that they have no way of knowing , cannot contact drivers and do not track their vehicles .

M	i still_haven_'_t had my stuff by the way .
F	signed_up for a one month rolling_contract sim only - ( carphonewarehouse has confirmed this ) but orange still refuses to cancel contract stating i signed_up for 00 months which is incorrect .
M	i also apologise for some of the things i said in the email , i was angered by the unfriendly and condescending email you sent me ( with the same tone as others you have sent before ) and i felt it was the last_straw .
F	!
M	a company you can trust .
M	if not i would probably look_elsewhere for my electronic goods in the future .
M	but .
M	oh , they said that they understood my concern ( standard reply content ) and they would look for a solution ( standard reply content ).
M	they '_ve even deleted the email address we had for contacting them .
M	also , i have some mild concerns about the product supplied .

M	e g tracking even when selected is not added unless you manually update .

M	i ordered a new pump for my indiset washer_drier , the pump arrived and was exactly as ordered .
F	to access my emails .
M	you sent me the wrong item , and then took months to correct it .
F	first_class cash_back .
M	i phone them at 0 . 00pm and they say its not coming .
M	nothing special and then found thing i brought was cheaper when we arrived !
F	theyare impossible to contact and there is no address on their website .
F	i have left out the details of so many unsatisfactory , unhelpful calls to call_centres abroad and in the uk , and several letters with no adequate responses .
F	one week_later i '_m still_waiting .
F	just googling the top line of my email got me loads of people with the same problem , site seems happy enough to take your money but they don_'_t have any of the items instock despite saying so !
F	long pole which is what i need as i am tall and other mops were for midgets !!
M	it was a nice trip , didnt have any_problems and the staff made it enjoyable ive been useing dfds even before they changed their name and ive_seen their growth and changes and its good to see they havent forgotten who made them as big as they are . us
M	i was then encouraged by three '_s official twitter_page to file a complaint on their website .
M	highly_recommended .
M	i have bought several spare & small partsfrom cult_pens , each time , i have recieved a dispatch_notification within a few hours and my purchase within a day or so + a free pen .
F	lillies were closed and not bloomed , looked really ugly displayed in a wrapped up brown sheeting , which was really crinkled by the person wrapping , lots of selotape tied around the bottom , looked total disgrace .
M	these two arrived , but i found that one was not adjustable in rotation about its stem - just tilted .
M	' it '_s in the terms and conditions ' was the reply .
F	i had to contact both interparcel and the courier concerned , and eventually managed to arrange the collection for the following_day .
M	however i thought the admin , postal , service charges were very high , with two £_00 originally priced tickets coming to £_000 .
F	i have ordered via another trustworthy online company and at_least my friend has a gift .
M	we were still charged the delivery charge even_though we ' d made strenuous attempts to check it would .
M	have used gamola_golf loads of times and will_continue to do so in the future .
M	one of the phones i sent was working_perfectly well when it left me , but had report that not working when got to you .
M	the jessops advert was for £ 0 discount on snowglobes using a special code . i ordered two snowglobes using the special code and expected that both snowglobes would receive the discount , i later found that the discount_code only applied for one snowglobe therefore i suggest that the jessops advert was misleading .
M	i purchased a feedback pro elite repair stand from these_guys ( if you don_'_t have one , get one ), and the whole_transaction was fantastically swift and smooth .
F	this lady from brentford store ( who was store manager ) kept going about me not telling the truth and they can '_t find any proof of payment etc .
M	had problems with orders missing items , had extremely rude and abusive emails ( just because i asked for orders to be changed and i returned one item ), poor packing that leads to damaged items .
F	will always use this company for similar purchases in the future .
F	i mean what '_s the point in putting a phone number down on an order if they ' re not going to try to call you to find you .
M	we cancelled the agreement with them as we saw many bad_reviews about one of their other_websites and have never , to this day , received a refund .
F	my order was placed late in the day but i was still able to secure a next_day delivery .
M	my advice , dont go with them in the first place .
M	i eventually raised a support_ticket and complaint with groupon .
M	the most irritating thing is you can '_t call these_guys and instead you have to use web chat to someone_who_uses pre_- pepared answers and ha a " computer says no " attitude .
M	not physically being there poses a whole_host of problems but the staff at steven_james guitar & amp could not have done enough to answer all of my questions and arrange for delivery of what is now my favourite guitar !!
F	the item is sold as adjustable but without instructions i have no idea how it works .
F	i contacted petplanet after my order which should have been received on next_day delivery had not arrived and was told my a rather apathetic individual that there had been delays in getting it to the main hub .

M	pretty_steep , considering the entire return flight was only about £_000 !
F	it was fantastic !
F	it was very easy to order , they were delivered when they said they '_d be and my friend was really pleased with them .
F	i '_ve placed two orders so far and have been very happy with both .

M	i can '_t process your complaint as only available for monday - friday 0000 - 0000 .
M	however , i recieved the full_amount for both of the phones i sent in and received the cheque the day immediately after they received the phone .
M	on the aircraft though they fall back into the ignorant misserable look .
M	you want to pay for something and never receive it
F	all in all not happy with the experience which cost me £_00 and will_definately never buy from them again and will spread the word amongst every gardener i know .
M	kind_regards
M	the main_thing to realise is that this is not a one man job - it is impossible without someone to help you .
F	very pleased thank_you .
F	i then asked to be removed from the database and my account closed .
F	however , the cost of the item was £ 0 . 00 .
M	initially didn_'_t expect much , but was overjoyed with the outcome ; she was helpful from_start to finish and at the end of the conversation i knew all my problems were resolved .
F	however , the flowers that came looked nothing like the flowers i ordered .
F	when on the store it said a medium was 00 / 00 .
M	i '_m_sure offcom will be absoloutly thrilled to look into yet another one of your complaints that are going to go legal .
M	better still they have started sending threatening_letters demanding payment of ' the bill ' despite my contacting them on numerous_occasions trying to sort_out the mess .
M	when you ask for a quote you '_ll get offers by text and what looks_like a mobile number to ring .
F	not at all clear from the site !
F	this was a great replica of the top_gun movie but the dress was very figure hugging not so great for the larger lady and the bomber jacket was so plasticky it made me sweat just trying it on !
M	no help - it still didn_'_t work .
M	macaroon bars were excellent
M	highly_recommended !
M	wouldn_'_t hesitate to use again and can recommend to anyone
M	i bought a tormek t0 from them , it was at the best price and service was prompt , overall very pleased
M	alas the engraved plate slid off the trophy within 00_minutes of its arrival and so i have just had to spend the last 00_minutes or so trying to fix it with super_glue - this was not so good .
M	it seems really good on the website but in reality , it didn_'_t really feel like a trophy .
M	they are the only airline to fly direct from london to biarritz .
F	product was very good quality , and promt delivery
M	this us the second time using echo , each time i '_ve found excellent deals and on my latest order i saved up to £_00 .
M	wether it was a genuine mistake or a ploy to get you to buy this saw , i dont_know , but be warned , take model no .
F	!
M	having spent around £ 0000 in a 0 week period on 0 orders , so_far not one has_been delivered on time or without bits missing .
M	my mate recommended me as he was so pleased with the service .
F	the seal of the pods needs to be looked at
F	after_placing an order on sunday i was able to track the delivery via their chosen carriers web_site .
F	i had to phone to let them which was a little inconvenient and i am not sure what i paid for the call , but the person_who answered was very apologetic , recognised the mistake immediately and the missing tablets were received within a couple of days .
M	excellent service at reasonable cost , thoroughly_recommended .
F	great price too .
M	which bases were compatible , product features , colour options , etc .
F	not happy .
F	it was due to be delivered in week 00 .
F	after i complained to the merchant i ordered the items , they replied " it must have been a miscommunication "!
F	will be using them again .
F	the booking process was fine until i encountered an_error_message_stating my card_details were entered incorrectly .
M	it '_s really amazing how much detail is present in such a large print .
F	the only let_down was that some pictures were not as clearly printed as i had expected and indeed had had with other printers ( photobox , for example ).
M	the boots are really nice and warm , definitely waterproof .
F	premium_rate number to ring on
M	i will be using the print_space again for sure .
F	was cheaper_than everywhere_else .
M	paid £_00 to keep a hard_copy of all our digital_photos over the years but some look shakey like the machine wasn_'_t calibrated correctly or something ?
F	my advice - go elsewhere and don_'_t touch hammonds with a barge_pole !!
F	i was so stoked and it fit me perfectly .
M	?
F	lenses were shown in stock .
F	will definitely be ordering from these again .
F	i discovered lenstore through my workplace and as i was short on lenses i wanted to try them out .
M	after telephoning their_offices i was told the item had gone to the wrong_address and they were unable to recover it .
F	we were on our way to a day out at the seaside which was getting cut short by this .
M	i ordered an 0in splash cymbal for my friend for christmas , but unfortunately the delivery date was a long time after , about 00 days in fact , but was then further postponed without telling_me when it would arrive , 0 days_later the item arrived .
F	exact , no_fuss , clearly detailed site and great price , my order was acknowleged instantly and arrived correct and on time . no_hesitation in offering a reccomendation to anyone considering a purchase .
F	so if your a lady with normal lady curvy legs be careful what size you order .
M	i used gd a few_years_ago and came back again for a recent_purchase .
M	no_problems with your service thanks ron harris
F	we reschedule to the following week and i ask them for a morning slot because i need to tutor students as alreayd have rearranged my diary once .
F	their underwear , men '_s socks etc still seem ok , but this is hardly enough to keep them going .
M	and is working fine the computor is up to full speed .
M	easy to use website , good choice of local_garages to have the tyres_fitted .
F	the order process was simple and straight_forward , but what was the best part was the updates on where my order was right up until the delivery .
M	there are obviosly much more in depth details to this unfortunate experience but needless to say for me it spoilt what should have been one of the happiest occasions in my life , just bringing me stress and hassle with their incompetance .
F	my items are on the path , an electronic device is thrust into my hand .
M	the sides were warped and nails hanging out in places .
M	so i '_ve got all this por00 paint and all set to spray underside of pick - up ,
F	the response was that it '_s now been cancelled and that their systems show a different collection date .
F	i have given iflorist 0_stars because although i never get to see the flowers / gifts that they have delivered on my behalf , i have received telephone_calls from very excited and grateful relatives and friends .
F	hispek & electric shop one and the same with different prices and delivery arrangements .
M	got the motor and panel wired up and followed the set_up process pressed the romote control and the gate worked first time .
M	i have never_experienced such miserable customer service from a company in my life .
M	all went well and the parcel was picked_up in the uk on the 0th_december .
F	because i neglected to get the registration date of the owners v0 before we parted company this did not match on the final certificate .
M	my fault i suppose as should have checked everything immediately but as the bag was sealed i wrongly_assumed everything would be there .
M	!
M	i '_ve yet to try the device out but the process of ordering it and the delivery couldn_'_t be_faulted .
F	however these have been transactions where i have had no_problems .
F	after pointing_out their error , they did apologise and ship my item ; unfortunately by this time too late for the birthday .
F	the price they gave_me was fair and reasonable to .
M	product ( longridge practice golf_club ), not so good .
F	order placed 00 may .
F	when i was tracking the parcel to my surprise i found on the delivery company website the shoes had been delivered .
M	proved popular with everyone in our party .
F	love you guys !
F	could you imagine if it had been the other way around ?!
M	this will be my one and only experience of flying with tap .
F	however , the glasses came , prescription is all good and they fit lovely .
M	i '_ve_used firstaid0sport several_times now and have never had any_issues with payment or delivery .
F	just a small thing but this ment so much to all the group after the last few hours .
F	i received a response to this email 0_days_later on 0nd_january ( probably because i titled the message are you ever going to reply to my messages ). informing_me that my item had not been received by them and asking for some more details ( order number , number of items in the box , how many boxes it was packaged in and a tracking_reference ) so that they could make a claim from ' my hermes ,' the courier service they use , for the loss of my hair_straighteners .
M	i was told sorry nothing we can do .
F	a very unhappy customer and will not be using ever again .
M	so that he wasn_'_t to be disappointed for longer_than necessary we ( that is he and his dad - me ) took the 00 mile or so drive to our nearest superdry shop in cardiff ( plus car parking charge ) and changed the jacket in store for him .
F	didn_'_t receive my item .
F	have bought fragrance on a number of occasions and completely_satisfied with prompt delivery and secure_packaging .
F	i was also directed to another compay where i could obtain a sample .
M	will be recomending you everybody and again placing orders in the near_future .
M	well_worth the £ 0 . 00 difference in cost , not to scrabble about in the cold under my own car .
F	im very annoyed about this delay as we should have been made aware that the item was out of stock before we made payment !
F	thank_you so much .
M	products okay but a little better communication during order processing would have been good , i was on the brink of calling for an update , if i could have found the number i would have done .
M	a good company would have sent an email to unfullfilled customers warning them of any delays .
F	i have used this company before but won_'_t ever again i ordered 0 bunches of flowers for elderly aunts for xmas .
F	love this store ; huge_range of products and very good customer service .
F	to say i was surprised was an_understatement .
F	service was brilliant .
F	i ordered a toilet online from this company .
F	that '_s all i wanted in the first place and luckily , be it from what was said or quite by_chance , it was delivered in time .
M	i have used speedgraphic before but would hesitate in the future .
F	possibly the lack of topping , it being cold , smelling foul , looking like it was made with the no possible care , helped towards its total failure .
F	so easy and no stress_involved .
M	since then i have suffered many acute side - effects including severe dry - eye ( waking me up 0 - 0 times a night with my eye - lids fused together ), ghosting & glare ( making me unable to drive at night ) pain in my eyes , and hugely variable clarity of vision that has meant i have been off work .
F	on this site with all the information you want and need .
F	one arrived and there was a note to say the other one more or less would be posted around 00 / 00 /_0000 .
F	i suppose the florist is limited in what they have and what percentage they receive from teleflorist .
F	- but my new bifocals while ok for reading up very close are too strong for me to read my laptop screen or car speedometer - which is really frustrating .
M	if next time you get the games ready for download on the release day , you would get a 0_star_review and a few more customers .
M	they are riddled with bureaucracy , take little or no ownership of customer '_s problems and toothless at resolving the most basic issues .
M	the thread on the peddle socket had completely worn out !
M	big plus aslo to national_tyres . fitters at horsham , west_sussex .
F	" we have received the revisions that you want , and our designers are starting their work on your project "
F	with an e_- mail telling_me the goods are on their way .
F	so your company has not only lied to me on the past five phone_calls as they told me it was the router that was the problem when in actual fact the engineer never came to my flat .
M	telephoned them the day before delivery to confirm all was well and would go_ahead as we were going to get_rid of old sofa .
F	having had problems with two stolen / lost coats , my order eventually arrived 0_weeks after original order .
F	i replied no i wanted my ipad .
M	cheap but never had to use them
M	they never phone you back , never reply to emails , you end up on hold for hours .
M	i posted the phone special delivery and the next_day , the money was in my account .
M	.
M	having googled for a online phone selling website , fonebank were top or near the top of the results and attracted my attention .
F	my mam gave_me this website and i am so pleased she did .

M	speedy dispatch and all as expected - definitely recommend them .
M	i '_m having to claim back the money through my credit_card , and have also reported wae_+ to watchdog and trading_standards .
F	shocking customer service .
M	with a very rare luck , 0 of them are dead on arrival .
F	hmmm , it was rather annoying to discover that there were no instructions on how to use this powder , it only stated what the daily recommended dose was .
M	i '_m awaiting a refund on my administration_charge as promised and will be ordering elsewhere .
F	if you are going to shop_here go well prepared , know what you are after and dont worry if it seems you are asking silly_questions .
F	few laptops available with windows 0 .
M	ordered online on a friday and the memory arrived on monday .
M	love the service but a bit to expensive for small start up company '_s may be offer new company '_s a better deal on there first time sms credits to see how they go
F	would not order from the new company if they paid me as can only_assume they knew what was going on and may even be still using the same staff .
M	i have a contract with o0 as well and have been for 00 years which will_definately stop at the and of the contract .
M	however we are happy to rearrange for delivery as quickly as possbile , including an upgrade to your order at our cost , by way of apology for the late delivery .
F	when you transfer_funds from a bank_account to paypal it says it takes 0 - 0_days but always takes seven and sometimes longer .
M	two_days_later i telephoned and was promised the order would be fulfilled in a few_days .
F	when we were advised about it a day or so later - the sole iceblock had melted and we had a box of rotten meat .
M	then to top it off another parcel from another retailer got the same treatment at the same time .
M	ouch !
F	expecting delivery by the end of next_day .
F	hi
M	for the first one , i received a call on behalf of the florist to say the driver was lost . could i confirm the address and telephone_number of recipient .
M	did get a refund .
M	my order 0000000 was cancelled in less_than 00_hours despite having purchase from there online store already twice before and numerous_times in store , apparently my card did not pass security for which they could have contacted me to confirm any details which i was happy to verify however they didn_'_t bother .

F	quick delivery and i got what i had ordered .
F	the bins were in poor condition , however the final_straw was when we saw the drivers mix_up both recycling bins and waste bins together .
F	no .
M	enquired when we arrived , but hotel full , so no oportunity of any change of room .
M	however this never happened , every other car_hire company picked all other passengers oup but we were left_stranded we phoned the number on the email and was just directed to a spanish voicemail .
F	on top of that , the goods i orderded ( 0 " x00 " plastic_bags ) are all too short !
M	well_done g0u great service .
F	i just wish that the fresh food items which are sent to other european_countries were available for us too .
F	easy to use web_site , orders fulfilled quickly and despatched imediately
F	i asked where the item was and they said in their warehouse - they didn_'_t have a driver available for 0_weeks yet wouldn_'_t let_me cancel my order .

F	as this was our_honeymoon we wanted something special and that is exactly_what we got .
F	i bought the clarisonic - fab product .
F	they didn_'_t arrive before she left at 0 :_00pm and they were apparently left in a secure_location at 0 :_00pm !
F	now , i was not an unhappy talk_talk customer as have been with them for years and so , caught offhand and realising that you get nothing for nothing no matter what the sales_guy tells you , i said okay .
F	in fairness to the staff at national and tyre_shopper they endeavoured to put things right and i have expectations when i get the tyres_fitted in week '_s time , with free tracking for the inconvenience .
F	they also delivered it to her home address as it was too late for delivery to the work address given .
M	i suggest that others do not use pet suupermarket as you will lose money and get ripped_off !
F	go to their website !
M	i got a pair of caravan ray - ban_sunglasses .
M	pricing remains very competitive and so why would you look anywhere_else !
F	the price was very competitive too .
F	i arrived without a locking_wheel_nut , your guys were really helpful and said i could come_back at any time as the tyre was in stock .
M	no expertise on site but happy to take your money .
M	daniel '_s advice continued throughout with tips and recommendations , which i found very practicable , encouraging and ultimately very beneficial .
F	i '_m wondering_if they have new systems in place or new staff ?
M	update 00 / 00 / 00
M	above all , the advice and service provided by jamie and his_colleagues was the key to my wife and i being_able to choose the speakers best suited to our listening style .
M	i '_m new to cycling ( road_cycling anyway ) and wanted to buy a bike that was suitable and good value for money .

F	the delivery was fast and free , arrived before the date given to me upon order which was great .
F	you have to watch every item go through the till and check your receipt .
F	i will certainly buy from outdoor and country again .
F	on taking it to the post_office i was told this wouldn_'_t cover the postage and had to pay £_00 .
M	i want my money back and i want compensation .
M	the books need to be specifically marked ex library and books marked very good have frequently been of inferior quality , but that is my personal experience , otherwise when they are operating normally they are a good service . postage is cool and delivery sometimes needs to be faster .
F	we ordered a sanivite system on monday_morning .
F	however the speed and efficiency of service has_been faultless over the last 0 years and i would not_hesitate in recommending them .
M	never again !!!!
F	she said they were very fresh and was thrilled to receive them .
F	going online gets me in a loop , and when i finally find the right page it tells_me the phone number isn_'_t valid , and that the system will now be locked , whatever that means .
M	i placed an order for an arrangement to be sent to sue , at the skewen medical centre , and another one for diane , at the same address on friday the 00th_september .
M	they are no doubt the cheapest supplier in this market but one of the worst service providers i have come_across .
F	do your homework before buying from these people .
F	glasses arrived in perfect_condition .
M	have totally given up with it now .
M	my pc does not hang while i have a number of programs running , including surfing the net .

M	c ' est n ' est_pas raisonable a penser que_la poste a ouvri et dechiré la boite .
M	bt are one those organisations that manage to shoot themselves in both feet .
F	i forgot my credit_card so was charged an additional £_000 . 00 for comprehensive insurance .
F	it did get very sore after about 00_mins but a friend had advised me to go to sleep for a few hours and when i woke_up i could see almost perfectly .
F	i asked how can you explain my email order confirmation on 00th_december then ?

M	i paid £_00 for an immediate unlock which ended_up taking about 0_weeks and only lasted until the next apple update when the exploit used was patched .
M	yes , you can see that its used ( a few minor_scratches ) but everything works_perfectly well & being dell the build quality is 0st_class .
F	the canvas is very high_quality , the service outstanding , and the price very reasonable .
M	excellent product , perfect fit .
M	the poor website design hampers the experience of shopping on this site .
M	it was a last_minute present but had to get something else instead .
M	i have upgraded my opinion of interparcel , because although their response to my non collection issues by hermes ( who should be avoided at all costs ), was slow and cost me my sale , eventually tried to rectify the situation .
M	i too like so many others have placed an order ( for a tv ) that was and still is shown as ' 0 in stock '.
F	excellent products excellent service .
M	boots contacted hermes on 00th_jan_0000 telling them to return the item back to them .
F	i complained and was given a refund on my delivery charge which was good .
M	bad_experience with argento and am defiantly not ordering from them again .
M	will be ordering again .
M	items received next_day which was good .
M	they need to have systems in place to guarantee that they deliver what they promise .
F	pleasantly_surprised with the ease in which it was possible to deal with the company considering we were suffering with ' recession ' problems and found our predicament difficult to speak about generally .
F	i was pleased with the rug and service , but i was disappointed that the rug has a slight imperfection , an irregular line in the pile .
F	excellent fast service : delivery next_day .
M	the only detailed_information on the site was how to download illegally hacked software .
F	doesn_'_t make me look too good when a bouquet arrives for our ( 00nd !!!)
F	i would reccommend to everyone .
M	the delivery men ' phoned 00_minutes before their arrival .
F	very rude customer service
F	i would like my £_00 . 00 back please iflorist , your customer service is appalling and unfair .
M	superb service and efficient communication .
M	good value contract and excellent free virgin to virgin calls but the foreign call_centre is appaling .
M	as far as the ordering and delivery schedule this could not be easier
M	that '_s good service .
M	!
F	we ended_up in budget accommodation .

F	poor service did not follow or print my delivery instructions and parcel ended_up with a neibourgh we do not get on with and my elderly_dog needed it as its the only food she csn eat
M	nice one guys , keep rockin '.
M	in fact the watch ended_up arriving sooner_than i expected so it all ended well .
M	the recipients were both very pleased with the flowers that they received .
M	would recommend in a heartbeat for anyone who is interested in getting a pair of decent headphones .
M	i have ordered two items recently , which were small and of low_cost , but wex do not have a lower , less hassle , system for posting these items .
F	the ordering process was pretty straight_forward but when i did have a question before i ordered i sent an_email and had a quick reply .
M	when spending over £_000 on a new winter_jacket you don_'_t expect the item to be faulty .
M	though i was on the verge of cancelling everything and taking back the broadband items i ' d purchased .
F	i would never use them again as i wrote an_email to them complaining and they did even bother to reply .
F	delivery was super_fast too . would definetly use them again .
M	just like online_retailers , you need to be careful what you buy .
M	would not use again and would definately not recommend to any of my friends , they may be cheap , but cheap is what you get in after sales .
F	i believed what i read on your site but they were a complete_waste of money .
F	sorting_out any_problems once the delivery men have left would be a pain .
F	i bought two outfits , one i thought was value for money but the other i was more than disappointed with , i just dont have time to return it as i didnt have time to find an_alternative .
M	!
M	the items arrived very quickly and were as_described .
M	i don_'_t usually bother_writing_reviews of companies , but in this instance felt_compelled to share my experience with others .
F	i haven_'_t got it still !
M	limoges is a very small airport anyway , so hardly likely to have any delays in terms of picking_up your vehicle
M	i used to use them as an_emergency supplier for the small_quantities of particular values of components i need for development work .
M	i ordered a brooks saddle .
F	0_days_later , i still hadn_'_t received a response so i called mopp .
F	the throw itself was every bit the quality i was hoping for and looks very classy on the bed .
F	yodel tracker ;
F	i joined with npower in november , after nearly 0_months with them i am astounded how completely_incompetent they are !
M	email reply on 0rd janu said they were ' happy to inform_me that my order had been delivered , gave no date , just a weblink to the delivery company '_s site .
M	from what i have since read it would appear that this is nothing more than a basic carpark with everyone driving around trying to find a space .
F	my items arrived within 00_hrs in perfect_condition .
F	vet uk offer a text service and email service to advise you when the goods will be arriving with a time .
M	i live approx 000_miles from my 00 year_old mum and every year i always send flowers to her for her_birthday !
F	these will be given away .
M	when i opened the boxes the quality of the workmanship and materials was plain to see .
M	thanks again
F	i did phone to complain_about this and spoke to someone in customer_services .
M	cjs provide some of the cheapest prices found on the web for games - on that front they get 0_stars .
M	my last four orders have been delivered by this company and even_though the instructions were to leave the box at the reception to my flat complex if i am not in , every_single time the delivery company has just left the boxes outside .
M	despite paying for an agreed delivery i received texts and emails to say a redeliveries had been attempted again on subsequent days - a complete_waste of time , fuel and cost for dpd and hardly a green approach to deliveries .
M	to this date 00th of march , my bank has still not received the £_00 . 00 rightfully owed , nor have i had any response to umpteen emails since feb_00th !!
F	thank_you for making my journey effortless :-)
F	told it had been out of stock but assured it would be sent out that day for delivery 0_days_later .
M	excellent service , and i also received a promo_code to give me a discount off my next purchase .
M	there has always been a problem with the images being printed much more darkly than what appeared correct on my computer monitor ( or what was satisfactory on my own printer ).
F	i am so gutted to have been treated so badly by what i had previously considered to be a fantastic company offering great products .
F	shockingly_bad service .
F	i bought michael mcintyre tickets almost a year before the event at wembley arena , and spent over_£_000 on 0 tickets .
M	i was told that the item was not at their warehouse but that it was expected to arrive today .
M	city_link
M	the delivery service was excellent - i was given a time_slot within which the delivery would be made .
M	sounds pretty mushy but i am that impressed with their service .
F	easy to order came with in days very good service and solar_lights very good
M	great prices and super_fast delivery .
M	the service itself was totally_unreliable and costly compared with other telephone and broadband providers . and they like to lock you into a 00 months contract !
F	sure enough , 0_weeks after i placed my order , the sunglasses i ordered actually turned_up - safe and sound , the real item , carefully_packaged .
F	it would seem that as long as the order is straight_forward then a good service , sadly , please be aware that if a problem is encountered you may be left hanging , or ignored .
F	however , the ' courtesy_call ' i received regarding the mistaken bad_review for normans was actually less_than courteous asking me to remove it .
F	all in all a really painful experience i will never order with them again and won_'_t be shy about telling others about this treatment .
F	poor service saa !
M	so i joined on an 00 month_contract , mobile_broadband device / myfi , it '_s the dongle that lets you connect up 0 separate devices to it at any one time , around £_00 per_month including_vat . sounds great right ?
M	bought a tarp .
F	requested the flowers be delivered on a saturday for a birthday surprise for the them to be delivered on the following_monday .
M	i went on - line and scheduled a redelivery when i would be home but no delivery attempt was made so it was a wasted day .
F	i only hope the 0rd arrived before world_book day on thursday ?!
M	would have been 0_stars but as the database on there side has_been down so unable to save my progress .
M	i telephoned to check whether the " new " style was available and was told that it was .
F	my contact was lee .
M	the positive_side : a call to the operator quickly re - established the pre_- paid booking and we were away .
F	thank_you
F	a very expensive calendar .
M	i don_'_t honestly care .
F	friendly , reliable and on your side .
F	useless company
F	i had a problem with delivery as i work mon - fri and the member of staff suggested that the delivery could be sent to my place of work .
M	i refused took accept the late delivery .
M	dread to think what happens to non - priority orders !
M	additionally , i was hit with a $_00 fee when the transaction did go through to my other us bank_account , for unknown reasons .
F	took it up with paypal who refused to refund because he was no_longer an ebay member .
F	thanks dfds .
M	swift delivery but left by hermes on my doorstep in full view claiming secure_location on card put through door !
F	ordered christmas_present for my daughter ; didn_'_t arrive .
F	yes i would , but it would have to be a very good deal on the item i wanted .
M	the package arrived in good condition , which was my main_concern , so i '_m happy and will use it again for sending computers .
F	so i rang up and spoke to a very helpful man called dave .
M	emailed twice but no reply .
M	not a single apology throughout the whole dealing_with them .
F	when the issue was solved ( within a few hours ) the item was sent to the delivery company and was recieved within 00_hours .
M	purchase and delivery went very smoothly .
M	i looked around online for months before_deciding to go with dinopc to build my desktop .
F	no apology , email update or single word from online baskets since the end of july .
M	there is an old expression that something is " a0 at lloyd '_s " .
F	the package stated it required a signature , there was no notification of when it was to be delivered , then a card stating we had not been in and to use the internet to rebook a delivery between 0 and 0 .
F	while i '_m doing this i get yet another email via asos .
M	i will think_twice about setting_foot in a stratstone or evans_halshaw dealership again .
M	( san pedro is a working town which would not be to everyone '_s taste as a holiday destination .
F	my flowers did not arrive before 0pm , but still , there '_s been no acknowledgement or apology .
M	my package arrived well before i expected it and is exactly_what i am after .
M	that said the box the presentation_box the bottle came in was in an just acceptable condition , apart_from a 00mm blue pen mark on the bottom of the box .
F	once they have your money they want nothing more to do with you .
F	i '_ve been using pharmacy0u for a long time .
F	after the first purchase i have since ordered a lot more blinds and hope they last .
M	we would have returned them but unfortunately time would not permit .
M	personally i think all deliveries should be first_class and it always irritates me that i '_m supposedly getting free delivery because i '_m spending more than £_00 only to be hit by , what is in effect , a delivery charge .
F	'_ve been buying from dobies for years .
F	i ended_up having to cancel my order .
F	again , we put our postcode in and it said then ' we can deliver to you on the 00th_june '.
M	i ordered 0 bottles of coffee syrup on next_day delivery for a big occasion .
F	i '_m delighted with the table ( cornilleau_sport 000 ).
F	i know when to expect deliveries and trust their quality .
F	seemed very quick and easy - the proof will be when the item arrives - hope it is as nice as it looks and if not how easy a refund is !
M	the roses are bruised , battered and look to be well past their best on the day of delivery .
M	the playbook would ‘ see ’ the pc but the pc said it was an unrecognised device .
M	whilst this is all going on there is no mention of refunds for this .
F	miss k young
M	i '_m_sure the offers on non - tangible goods are ok but buying an actual product is a nightmare .
M	the height_adjustment lever hardly does any work apart_from going up and down by couple of inches and it doesnt really go as low as most other chairs .
M	doubling up of postage charge i assume this was to post items between different warehouses before despatch to myself , as cycling knicks do not add weight nor volume to my small order .
F	they advised me to inform the company of this ( i have done ) and if they still refuse a full_refund they will assist me with contacting_trading_standards - something i fully_intend to do .
M	* i telephoned them late_afternoon on their 0000 number ( presumably expensive , but the cost isn_'_t show on their website and they don_'_t offer a " local " rate or 0000 free rate call ).
F	normally a good prompt service but was disappointed with the last delivery .
M	so it probably is in stock , we don_'_t know .
M	placing orders is easy especially repeat_orders online however when it comes to customer service the contact , attitude and approach makes you realise your money should have been spent elsewhere
M	of the lights
F	without a doubt !
F	i gave up and booked it myself on line where it does accept my vehicle , it also costs £_00 less . the only problem is i could not choose the type of ticket and got the saver one .
F	i have used animed before and been very happy with service and speed of delivery , but this time it took them about a week to tell me that i needed a new prescription .
M	i was happy when i completed my booking but as i printed out my confirmation there was a cost of £ 0 transfer each way that i was not made aware of when booking .
M	i also don_'_t need a monthly_subscription as i don_'_t use contacts during the hayfever season and often threw out ' out of date lenses ' what a waste !
M	fantastic , so i did the order there and then on the phone .
F	we find the stools very uncomfortable , the back rest cuts right into your lower back , we removed the backrests .
F	so , i had no gifts for mother '_s day and still_haven_'_t .
F	i '_ve been playing since 0000 .
F	i will not be using teleforist ever again .
F	i ordered the contact_lens ontime - lenstore sent a return email within_seconds - staing when i should receive them - they sent me another email when they were despatched and they arrived when they said they would .
M	basically poor communication .
M	sent them back with no_problems but new pair are exactly the same i feel like they weren_'_t checked went sent back and just turned around and sent out again .
F	ordered crocs which arrived promptly within 0_days .
F	the products that arrived were good , but 0 small packs of table_confetti missing from order
F	i am so impressed with the way they deal with their clients .
M	bill reference rosendal : 00 / 0000000 .
M	there was nothing on the web_site to say i needed to specify vari - focals in the notes .
F	the website was easy to follow and offered a variety of choice .
M	so then , what is this chemistdirect for £_00 doing on my credit_card statement then ?
M	before buying an expensive cable decide_whether it really is worth so much more money just for such a minimal picture difference that you probably wouldnt notice anyway unless you stare at the screen long enough .
F	great selection , got everything .
M	seems to be the perfect option
F	i found the location convenient and quick and would have been very happy with the service , except the paint work on the car had been damaged over the wheel hub and pocked in other_places .
M	really easy to talk to and frendly
M	but when i received the goods i asked customer_support and they said it was incorrectly advertised online .
F	i had previously shopped_around with other_companies but had felt a bit_wary as i sensed a pressure from them .
M	heavy_duty chain splitter failed to split standard 000 chain so very iffy quality as was the fly shorts with waistband that comes off in you hand .
F	i am now counting_down e days until i can book again to go back meeru .
F	speedy delivery , great communication and product exactly as_described .
M	i reserved a multi cooker from their maidenhead store ( that i could have had slightly_cheaper from amazon - but i needed the item there and then ) and went to pick it up .
F	really quick delivery , good price , will buy again .
F	then , months later , in june , i receive an e_- mail saying they had tested my phone and i was being offered £_00 .
M	then i got a phone_call from the guy picking me up asking where i was and i explained , he then said he was in terminal 0 which was interesting as i was in terminal 0 .
F	their service is impeccable and , so far , the deliveries have arrived before the promised date .
M	that seemed to put me on some kind of a map , and i was soon getting emails from more people wanting me to be their ' friend '.
M	lastly , 0 years_ago you were also beating your competitors , offering more money and better security / assurance ( in what was a new process for me ) in that you were orange , or very least you are directly associated with them .
M	looks_like the packer accidentally dragged a ring over it .
M	the reviews are clearly fake and genuine customer won_'_t rate company when the provide such a poor service .
M	good service , friendly website
F	bought 0 magnetic polishes but one didn_'_t work .
M	it may be popular .
F	i recently_purchased a solid_oak_dining_table with 0 chairs and an oak_sideboard from wowcher , totalling nearly_£_000 . 00 !
M	felt a bit heavy when i took them out of the box but once on my feet they were just like a normal pair of work boots , & they are very comfortable .
F	it arrived early , was a perfect_fit and was the best quality fancy_dress outfit i have ever had .
F	i told her previous 0 operators had been disasters , and she explained they are not able to refer a caller on .
F	your the cheapest on the market , maybe this is why ?
M	0 ) 0 days of lost pay through taking annual_leave for failed delivery , replacements and engineers .
F	i then received another that they delivering 0 hampers , one to me 0 to mum , again i called , " don_'_t worry i have cancelled 0 to your address .
F	the bottles of robinsons juice are well_packaged with each wrapped in bubble_wrap and sealed in an individual bag .
M	those bars were easy to fit , and look great , mind you , i '_m still fiddling with cables and hoses to get a nice run .
M	great choice of games and levels to suit all pockets .
F	fabulous delivery time , great drinks but you need to sort_out your extremely un - environmentally_friendly packing methods .
F	we all have a safe_place to leave products if we are asked .
F	my husband has wanted a summerhouse for years .
M	i '_ve_used event_tyres for car tyres several_times and always been happy with the service .
F	thank_you !
M	today we have a new portner here and the same thing happened , the grocery newer reached me .
F	i rather next time if the person would take a minute just to knock .
M	service very good but your but your xmas offer did not did work .
M	on this occasion the flowers were not up to your usual standard , mainly_because they opened the same day and did not last more than a few_days .
F	we ordered the basic range and we ' re really pleased with them .
M	overall disappointed is a understatement !
F	i really cant imagine that so much stock changes that much in just a couple of days .
F	what incompetent idiots .
M	great speedy service .
F	beware of this website !
M	brilliant .
M	so , after 0 - 0_weeks of inconvenience & £_00 . 00 , the issue is resolved .
M	people beware !
M	this site has the lowest_prices of any other site i '_ve came_across .
M	offer included free accessory_kit .
F	however deliver was awful , i had requested leave with a neighbour if no answer but the flowers were left_outside the front of the premises where they were all night because the recipient had been home all the time .
M	good tips on buying the right glasses and whats fashionable .
F	but anything i can quote is just my opinion - just my disappointment .
F	!
M	i know that the ' terms & conditions ' state all this but , honestly , how much_trouble and expense would it be for the company to allow 00_minutes extra for the delivery and to dispose of the packaging for us ?
M	i explained this to budgetair but still they said it would cost £_000 fee .
F	the car had made a return trip from palma_airport to port andratx , return trip to andratx town and a return trip to palma from port andratx .
F	my experiences have all been good , however , and apart_from the delivery man being unable to read my number on the door , all good .
M	although there was a computer clitch when trying to finalise my choice , i was directed to tyreshopper '_s call_center and was handled with particular speed & efficiently .
M	my company ordered several chairs from office_furniture and after a while the arm
F	i would highly_recommend this company to anyone looking to build a system for high performance at competitive_prices .
M	i will never use hotelopia again .
M	thank_you e_- flowers
M	the dog is great and looks great among the bushes in the garden
F	very disappointed and may stop me buying again .
M	superb
M	not only that , but they kept me completely up to date with status emails throughout .
F	i came_across procook at cheshire_oaks a year and a half ago , made a couple of purchases and brought them back to london .
F	all this is down to chemist_direct selling products at a reasonable_price .
M	they told me that sometimes a van driver can be delayed and it might be as late as 0pm before anyone arrived .
M	i wont send them back as i dont have time and it is a considerable hassle and will eventually just discuard the shorts
F	=== update 00 / 00 / 00 ===
F	my children have been to camp beaumont for the last three years and have always loved their experience there .
F	to sum up in a few points :
M	hard to see the products well and bit of faith needed that you are picking the right thing
F	he then passed me to the cancellations team to have my account returned to its original status .
M	the bonus was that i received a small package after i had returned the lens .
F	the galaxy bar_stools look very stylish and are a great price compared to other_suppliers but they are finished poorly so it is a trade - off on price vs quality .
M	recommended
F	it may sound silly but one of the first things i noticed were the clouds !
M	this time i was guaranteed that the delivery would definitely be made the next_day ( 00rd ) before_noon .
M	i have now ordered via their website a medium and a large size of both the rover and the titan mitts , so that i can try them on at home , decide what i want and send the other 0 pairs back under their free return service .
F	the majority of them will be willing to share their experiences which have been extremely negative .
F	the only problem was two christmas puddings containers cracked and seal was broken during shipment .
F	!
F	a very polite , efficient chap sorted it and refunded .
M	but , regarding facebook , i realise i am reviewing a product which works , but which i have no interest in , like a chicken - sexing kit .
M	appalling customer service .
F	do not touch this company with a barge_pole , the after sales_team are a joke .
F	i have used this company before and have found them to be the cheapest on the web for the cat_food i buy , delivery is free and the order is processed very quickly .
F	this was excellent , i ordered my fitflops on monday_morning and was wearing them out on tuesday_afternoon .
F	i liked alot of items on your site , but i don_'_t think i will shop with you any more , as i think you could have refunded my postage because of the amount i spent and the missing item .
F	collecting the item however was alarming . i followed the click and collect sign which was pointing into a dispatch area with forklift trucks flying about . the sign on the gate said hoot your car horn for assistance which i did and i was beckoned into this industrial area and led into the warehouse . it did not feel a safe_environment for a customer to be and i would suggest relocating the click and collect area .
F	if i am looking for something alcohol related i always go to whisky_exchange first , i have always found it so havnt needed to go_anywhere_else . prices are good , delivery is excellent and they dont leave parcels on the doorstep if you are not in .
M	phone ) others had no idea of what i required . no wonder local business '_s lose out tried internet and buyabattery came
M	their customer service team also seems to be based overseas which in my experience is not not conducive to a good business .
F	i also love the free gifts that i can always use .
M	just do not expect any niceties / customer service
F	might have been better instead of in basket in a vase .
M	i am slightly_disappointed , 0 of my purchases have been particularly troublesome .
F	not clear that extra_charges were added , sms confirmation , cancellation_cover plus booking_fee
M	i like the range of products - but they are at close to list price on most of it .
F	i found the bed i wanted online , on sale , however i decided to go to my local_branch to order as i was hoping to see one on display ( which it wasn_'_t unfortunately ).
F	i would recommend this site .
M	checked their paperwork when i got back home and it said they had inflated tyres to 00 psi front and back - thought that was odd should they should be 00 psi front and 00 psi rear ( not hard since manufacturer '_s label with correct pressures is inside the driver '_s door ).
M	they emailed the day after that to say the items were being despatched .
F	every item i have ordered has not been delivered on time or when it was arranged for .
M	interparcel used to be the cheapest for ups ( pretty_much the only service we use - they actually turn_up and do not damage our goods :) but now they are hammered on price by p0g 00_% of the time .
M	this was my 0st order from cewe .
M	over all the quality was good value and the cupboards were great but pensioners older than us or disabled people should be advised by showroom staff that assembly is required and not suitable for some people why cant they be delivered assembled like other_companies .
M	opened said duff .
F	yes i got what i ordered but i do not recommend to use this company if you are in a hurry .
M	i opted for the fitted service and your office even gave_me a courtesy_call to say the fitters ( national_tyres in aylesbury ) had 0 in stock but the other 0 were due to be delivered the morning of the fitting so best to phone them to make_sure they had arrived .
F	the diamonds are beautiful but i feel that i was miss sold a product .
M	exactly_what i needed , but didn_'_t even know this kind of service existed !
M	the we get a letter from ( name ) saying that they wanted to cancel the contract and give us a refund due to us not being abl to take delivery on 00 / 0 / 00 when we are out of the country .
M	i '_ll start by saying i used too give ebuyer 0_stars , they have competitive_pricing .
M	there is nothing cheap and cheerful about easyjet anymore , they just try and scam you at every opportunity .
F	i ordered 0 items on 0th_september ; the website advised there was a 0 week wait for 0 of the items and the whole delivery would be sent at the same time .
M	good , helpful and effective communication .
M	i phoned them and they could not beat the offer i had but then they gave in and made it a little cheaper , so i stayed !!
M	just over a year later they ask me for a revew .
M	six days after my order , stuff is still not shipped from the warehouse .
F	will definitely use again .
F	though the lenses came with the perfect prescription , the frames are quite flimsy and one of the four_pairs i purchased was so bent that i can '_t wear them .
F	i wasn_'_t surprised therefore when the phone rang ten_minutes after_placing my washing_machine order .
F	they were able to do the job with little notice and the engineer came within the two hour_window i was given and completed the job quickly ( i can '_t comment on quality as it was just a service , but we haven_'_t had any_problems ).
F	!
F	this is down to basic admin !
F	it '_s not helpful either when you have to call 0000 number !!
F	i have returned to rubber_sole once again to purchase genuine brand foot wear , as i have never been disapointed .
F	), i said " i can '_t_believe this will be the 0th time someone has passed me on ."
F	after 0_days and no reply to my email i telephoned their number .
M	no issues .
M	no_problems with this order although the lead time was longer_than i would have liked and it was hard to tell when it was coming .
M	i bought it over the phone and had great customer service , timely delivery .
M	once ordered easily from the website the delivery was quick and item well_packed .
M	i was told that selectspecs have no responsibility once the hong_kong order has_been shipped so no way hose for a refund .
F	lol .
F	when i did , the gentleman i spoke to was polite and friendly , advised me of the issue ( the address ) and the parcel arrived that afternoon .
M	amazon is the first_port of call whenever i need . well , anything .
M	john huw davies
F	laura wells
M	i have therefore persevered with the batteries but one has now died completely .
M	my record was delivered damaged and instead of being offered a refund straight_away i was insulted when i was told to provide evidence of the damage .
F	and the free chocolate was not included in the delivery !
F	mine was not working and i still received £ 0 into my account within days .
M	got charged for both normal delivery and fast track very expensive
F	but the fixings are not solid enough and we have to be very careful when we pull the string .
M	tyre_fitter was very good , polite and professional .
M	the quality of the final product was great !
M	this is fustrating !
F	prompt pick_up but it took quite a long time to receive the money .
F	excellent value , quick service and quick refund on returns !
F	on checking the terms and conditions i see that because i connected i will be deemed to have accepted these terms and conditions and agree that you will also lose your statutory right of cancellation under the regulations .
F	!
M	communication of all_aspects of the transaction of the highest order .
F	they sent a young_man from indonesia who not only spoke little english , but had clearly never cleaned a home before .
M	super quick delivery
M	parcel link are good as a coureir booking company but city_link are not as good !
F	lastly the quality of the actual furniture itself was neither well made or very solid in some places .
F	i would definately return to this company again for future invitations and would not_hesitate in recommending their service to family & friends .
M	now i '_ll think_twice about purchasing from them again .
M	maybe a larger magnified picture would help .
F	and he was going to charge me for a regas too !
F	easy to order and quick to deliver .
M	i decided on argos_vouchers and they were with me within 0 days of posting the phone .
F	it is now the 00th_march and i still_haven_'_t received anything .
M	. on 0 separate_occasions ' after ' taking this delivery , we were rang up by
F	i was kept_updated with the order progress and it arrived the following_day .
F	no_issues .
F	i am thoroughly disappointed .
M	at 0pm we hadn_'_t heard from the driver so i called fires - cookers .
M	dfds verry good i recomend to everyone who like travel
F	i just use it to check the cost of tax for any new cars i buy .
M	i then got an email about three_weeks_later telling_me my item had been shipped .
M	doesn_'_t smell good , so won_'_t be ordering from them ever again .
M	did you read my review ?
F	0_star just for the fact got my money back .
M	i wonder_how often they do this ?
F	i hope the phones are recycled and are a small contribution to reusing whats already availble & not messing up more of the enviroment .
F	within a few_weeks i had a cheque to pay into my account !
M	think_twice before booking with them .
F	i would have rather they let_me know ahead of time or make the other products backorder and send them later .
M	upon delivery i noticed that the shower arm screw_thread was way too short to fit correctly on a tile and dry wall board securely yet still allow a connection to the water feed .
M	expensive administration .
F	my main question is , why on earth was this not checked when i called or when they replied to my e_- mail ?
M	can '_t wait for the better weather and gardening in luxury sound .
M	product arrived on time and in perfect working order .
F	can i have an e_mail to confirm my hotel is booked ?
F	fast delivery and good prices .
M	i '_ve had a webiste with wix . com for about 0 months and it has_been working quite well .
M	however , when i sat in my lounge looking at the bouquet , i felt disappointed .
M	further to this , one week_later i get a knock on the door from a neighbour who took_ownership of my eventual delivery 0 days prior as i had been out at time of delivery but courier didn_'_t leave a ' i missed you note ' so i we unaware of this .
M	the very best high_quality " souvenir '_s " with a high_quality , discreet sirvice .
F	the following_day 0 of the 0 refrigerated items were delivered and the delivery note said the other items were out of stock .
F	however , the size of the packages has_gone down from 00kg to 00kg but the price has_gone up !
M	the manufacturing date is about two years_ago .
M	thanks very much !
M	colours look so much_better on quality paper than on a pc screen or iphone display .
M	thought was given to how our logo would best be suited to the right value product .
F	needed to be red !
M	this company will rip you off - their communication is non_existent , they take a 00_% cut of any debt and then won_'_t pay it to you for months .
M	several more days passed with no delivery and i called again .
F	i had to make a series of phone_calls which have cost at_least £ 0 , 00 as the phone line is a premium_rate one .
F	i was very impressed by the service given .
M	the day came to pick_up the car and as we sorted last bits and pieces and i was shown how many checks the car had gone_through before i was receiving it the salesman held up the spare , none remote key declaring the other was missing , but it wouldnt take long to get another !!!
M	very nice 0 bed villa with pool but . cockroaches appeared in kitchen after dark on first evening .
M	after that point we were implicitly invited to leave icuk by their staff and it was implied that the problems we suffered as a result of the oversubscription would be a regular_occurrence .
M	they were missing some of the features specified on the berghaus and outdoor shop websites .
F	i waited , at 0am , with a toddler , in the cold , for nearly an_hour for my car .
F	it '_s very reassuring to be able to speak to a real_person !
F	definitely use again unlike printerpix !!!
M	this product differs from prescription ed medication in that it not only dramatically increases the physical ability to perform satisfactorily but also has a great effect on the libido .
M	i asked them to pursue this but so_far have heard_nothing back .
F	i sent the shoes back on friday and received an_email today ( monday ) saying they '_ve processed my refund and it '_ll be in my account within a few_days .
M	i placed an order on 0rd february .
F	0 hour delivey slot given and it arrived in that time .
F	goggles0u provide such a vast_array of frames and an excellent price for thin & light lenses .
M	but i was surprised to discover i had paid nearly_£_00 for tickets with a face value of only £_00 .
F	i have been completely let_down by wren living .
M	swift delivery , items as_described
F	sure they smile when it suits them but there has_been an air of everything is too much_trouble recently - rolling eyes , sighs , just general body language that indicates they would just rather sit_down and read their mags in between the times they throw meals at you .
M	zero p_&_p was the clincher .
M	at_least i wasn_'_t paying through the nose for a high_street agent to give the same level of service .
M	thoroughly_recommend .
F	very happy with this purchase .
M	i will buy again but check on stock prior to pushing the buy button . if possible to get such an answer .!
F	i called to check whether my lenses were in stock as they were in short supply elsewhere .
M	i purchased a multipack product , which saved me 00_% on supermarket prices .
F	will use them again definitely .
M	flowers withered buy ok , but delivery service much to be desired , i was advised the flowers where on there way at 00 ; 00 in the morning , finally arrived on my door_step at 0 ; 00 at night .
F	after a lot of calls back and forth , i was told mattress is " made to order " and it would not be available another 0_weeks .
M	after another shop let_me down with no stock , taunton_leisure wer able to confirm that they had stock and i got my new boots 0 days_later .
M	they even phone you the day before your order is delivered and send you a text to confirm its dispatch .
F	00 emails , 0 phone_calls ( i gave up phoning because they can only stick to the script , not actually help at all ).
F	so turned to senrenata flower '_s .
M	we pre_- paid £_00 . 00 for 0 days rental .
F	i would recomend holisticshop .
F	the web_site was very frustrating .
F	wont_be using this company again , unfortunately because the service was exceptional but the product was not .
F	next time i will order with my old supplier .
M	ps_: beratung bei tanja auch auf deutsch möglich !
M	this is the second using the service and i am quite disappointed in the quality this time round .
F	i have already_recommended lenson to other people .
M	collected car from linate airport .
M	thanks for a delightful experience , everything was brilliant
F	superb service .
M	but was told car was booked at terminal one .
F	product took longer_than_expected to be delivered but i understand that this was due to a problem with the supplier .
F	will definitely order from you again .
F	we headed to the childrens tv area to find the dvd_player was not working of which i know when we traveled with you in november it wasnt working then either !
M	the new ones looked good so were fairly happy in the end .
F	item posted quickly without high shipping prices .
M	i have come_across a few glitches but the main one has to be " paypal ".
F	would definitely recommend , bought a bugaboo parasol which was out of stock pretty_much everywhere_else so didnt think i would be able to get it , but it came the next_day , with no_problems was very impressed !
F	the price was reduced making it great value .
M	after paying online received an email a few_days_later saying the item was not in stock .
F	great communication by email too , thanks
M	my vehicle was delivered on the expected date only to find it was the wrong_colour and not what i had ordered !
F	the courier was going to the wrong_address .
M	ook nu hebben wij onze vakantie bij corendon geboekt .
M	then you find your email bombarded with requests of reviews , surveys , product suggestions .
M	argh !
M	very poor customer service so_far .
F	for more information see our shipping policy page .
F	in september , using a wowcher , we bought a 0 " tablet from <_external link_removed >.
M	very professional and good pricing .
F	this is a complete_joke and i will never use this service again / discourage anyone i know from using your awful company .
F	with superdry however they took every piece of information from my paypal_account without warning me that they would do so .
M	i used the mobile site throughout and it was really easy to use !
M	i can recommend phamacy0u without_reservation .
M	all in al a refreshing_change to many of today '_s robot retailers who don_'_t seem to understand that without customers they don_'_t have a business .
M	told me my phone was blocked !
F	it '_s really easy to use and i got some great photo confetti and balloons for my dad '_s 00th_birthday_party .
F	again they replied quickly saying they would speak to the couriers for me .
M	they have reported the problem to our it department to ensure this gets resolved as quickly as possible .
F	communication really good .
M	avoid this company all they do is take your money .
F	always on time and delviery people always very fiendly and helpful .
M	in summary_:
M	i was very unimpressed by the whole_process which wasted time and money with no useful outcome .
M	on time and did what they promised
M	thanks for all the help , reasonable prices and support you offer ( again , for free !)
M	these were identical and need a private_prescription .
M	however i must_say that the customer service team did a spot on job in issuing a replacement jacket as soon as i could prove the faulty item was on its way back to them ( via the collect_+ tracking_number )
F	really happy with it .
F	their staff are helpful , but it would be a good idea if there was a pop up when ordering these slim line shower_trays asking if feet are needed as they are not included .
M	it was returned before i knew i had lost it , no charge .
F	very frustrating .
M	spoke to laura on the help_desk and she was extremely knowledgeable and helpful and resolved my issues very effectively .
M	a commendable control , however , frustrating since the reason i gave a different delivery address was that i no_longer lived at the invoice_address .
F	any_queries are dealt_with immediately and efficiently by friendly staff , in my experience .
F	you are charging a lot for these items , please pack properly !
F	easy to use and delivery quick .
M	helmet was wrong_size ( my fault not shops ) they arranged a free collection for the next_day and turned around a replacement which arrived the next_day .
M	the delivery due date came and went and when i contacted the seller they told me it had been lost in the post and that they would refund me !
M	i understand mothers_day is a busy day for deliveries , and my mum is very slow , but surely that '_s to be expected on mothers_day for quite a few recipients !?
F	very quick delivery and good value
F	pam .
M	the star piece on the trophy can be told that you simply just glued it on , this made it look like you didn_'_t even make the glass part of the model .
M	i have been using strings_direct for many_years .
M	- unbeatable .
F	i put the things in my basket on the company website , then go to topcashback to see if it '_s one of their merchants .
F	when i telephoned them i was told the driver had run_out of time .
M	delivered in 0 days from email excelent .
F	really impressed .
F	i had been promised the speed wouldn_'_t fall below 0 mb , but it did .
M	a car like this is quite likely to be hired for a special_occasion so such things should be attended too - we had to spend an_hour cleaning it before it could be used .
M	sadly the product did not work our as hoped for so returned .
F	i waited all day and it eventually came late_afternoon i am disabled so needed them to carry it in for me , got the feeling that they didnt normally do that .
M	excellent service , 0st_class
M	they sent out a new item almost as soon as the faulty one was returned .
F	i felt that he could have at_least asked me to rebuild them and he would make_sure the orders were dispatched on time or he could have offered a discount but nothing , just rudeness .
F	ordering was simple , they let you know when delivery will take place - you get to choose if you want - they came back with options for earlier dates , called to agree what worked !
F	i will definitely be using them again !
M	now i have been told it will be collected because they have no charger , on monday .
M	delivery was very fast .
M	consequently it takes a lot of phone_calls , half the day and wasted time to sort this out .
F	how embarrassing .!
M	the one miinor thing that is not very good is when they send orders by royal_mail over whom they have no control and who are particulary bad in my area .
F	they handed us a customer survey while my partner was looking at the finance_agreement to divert our attentiion .
F	never had any isses
M	i bought some stuff from them on ebay .
F	have gradually discovered that this is a very unfair and bias site
M	excellent fast service with super value products .
M	when i rang late rooms it was to try and cancel an error i made in booking the hotel , the cancellation was done quickly and effectively it was apparent when i turned_up at the hotel the request for it to include breakfast was not carried_out and rather spoilt the end of what had been a nice holiday
F	three_weeks_later still no items delivered !
M	great service and i would certainly recommend go - electrical based on my experience .
M	the whole_process from signing_up to receiving my cheque took less_than a working week and i cannot_fault a single stage of the process .
M	i have looked elsewhere for competition but always keep_coming_back to proswimwear .
F	i had given up on ever receiving the item so ordered from another company and it arrived after 0_days and on the same day as the item from one click pharmacy .
M	yes , theirs something a little special about going into a plush ad & buying your watch , it '_s a personal event , but with the money i saved buying from ironic i was more then happy to trust them & the service they provided .
F	what more could one ask for ?
M	n vnsgvngjna
M	this is the 0th time we have used cabreramedina when visiting lanzarote .
F	it didn_'_t arrive until after the job was completed .
F	i do not think that the site is user firnedly at all
M	i would highly_recommended to everyone , who would like working in it environment .
M	the kwik_fit guy was friendly and polite and i would highly_recommend this service .
M	the website is easy to use
M	excellent quality and competitively_priced tyres supplied and fitted in just a few_days .
M	goods then received 0 days_later , all ok per the order .
M	i like when you post a review :
M	purchase my items and always receive them next_day .
M	hi , this was a fast and no hasstle way to sell an old phone that i would never use again .
M	unfortunately , i purchased a large ( being a medium to large build ) and the costume was small to medium at best .
M	the " after sales " service could not be_faulted and provided a fast delivery service , including engraving on the stethoscopes .
M	as i said - used them so many_times and no doubts will be back there for some more gear soon ;)
M	will_definitely be using these_guys again .
F	i think i will end up ringing them in the end to see what on earth is going on and why i haven_'_t had a response from them .
M	at this point , i ' d had enough so i called customer_services who said they could put a note on the file to make provisions for compensation / credit but that i wouldn_'_t be able to phone and sort this out until the bloody fibre service was installed .
M	pros_:
F	?
M	- too late for a birthday_present .
M	overall an excellent experience - we were even able to observe a video review of the washer_dryer via the company website .
M	when you ring this company there is nobody who you can speak to for advice there is no personal_touch
F	i was told that someone would get back to me .
M	i would recommend this company and will be using them again if we need more usb_drives .
M	i will give mr m another chance so i know i shall be shopping with them again as i love their products and the people there are great .
M	delighted with our furniture and would recommend oak_furniture_land .
F	the goods arrived promptly and in excellent condition .
F	very quick way of booking car_hire online and you always tell you which car_hire company you are using unlike_other car_hire_companies .
M	each package weighs 00 - 00kg maximum .
M	almost a month on , i still_haven_'_t got it .
M	site easy to use , quick & reliable
M	we received an e_- mail saying that the book had been despatched more than a week before arriving .
M	throughout the semester they helped_us with anything we needed promotion - wise .
M	i left bt 0 years_ago because of their appalling customer_services .
M	well it only took 00_minutes before the phone was answered !
F	once we had ordered , it was sorted , despatched and delivered very quickly .
M	and that seem to be a common topic of most reviews .
F	i would have thought mp could at_least run to the right sized plastic scoop in the bags !!!
F	this i had not received so i contacted them to confirm the procedure .
M	i have called three_times and its been three_months and still no sign of my money .
M	good courier used which gave you an_hour_slot so you don_'_t have to wait around all day .
F	a superb chakra necklace , that is much_admired , whenever i wear it .
F	my ink came really fast !
F	i expected them to take a week and to my surprise they were delivered in two_days by ups through tranglobal .
F	it is a scam company .
F	really impressed .
F	reliable , lot of choice and access to availability , easy to use and a lot of useful comments from users
F	it had faults from screws not being screwed in to shelf bracket shattered and cracks in the side it was rubbish .
F	avoid this company at all costs .
F	delivery did not meet the final 00 day deadline and i chose a 0 wheel vehicle to make it easier for the company to deliver which_meant i did not receive discounts .
M	bought an aviation style wall_clock , arrived exactly as detailed on the web - site .
F	b ) make_sure you print all ' ticket ' correspondence with them .
M	ordered a microchip cat_flap which was £_00 less_than anywhere_else , came within 0 days free_postage so on strength of this ordered worming_tablets and flea_treatment , again came within 0 days and cheaper . now my first stop for pet products
M	this really made my 0 day break to istanbul a total hit .
M	in all fairness the staff did tell us there was a lot of packaging .
F	i would use serenata_flowers again for their efiicency , swift delivery and easy online ordering service .
M	one of our blinds came in a damaged box and when i turned it up one way all the screws fell out .
F	i had the payment stopped at my bank , so they have now issued me with a debt warning .
M	communications we ' re ok , but nowhere_near as detailed and informative as aforementioned company .
F	will never order from this site again .
M	ordered by phone , delivery arrived very promptly , my universal / ioa tickets were what i expected , real tickets .
F	previous comment / complaint : when i first joined - up , it was to be in time for december , although this did not happen and the letter that arrived confirming my membership had my name spelt incorrectly .
M	i felt this was quite rude .
F	i '_ve done this flight from heathrow to nassau many_times .
M	good e_mail up dates on delivery
F	if this is the type of service i can expect i will not be using them again which means i will avoid very . co . uk .
F	on looking up other banks after transfer , i saw that i would pay nothing in fees with rate of exchange the same or slightly better .
F	thought the idea of sending flowers to somebody was for them to receive them already arranged .
F	!
M	rather disappointing
F	high_quality clothing at a fair price .
F	this is very miss leading .
M	it '_s never off !
F	0_days_later i got a rude and unhelpful email back which basically said the orders are lost , sorry about that , nothing i can do .
F	very satisfied with the service .
F	i do not go_anywhere_else for my batteries !
M	if i accept their offer it will cost me £ 0 to send the bracket back .
M	i visited homebase on line , as the items i wanted were not in store .
M	arriving / parking / departing is hassle - free .
F	i was so disappointed as ( in my opinion ) i '_d spent quite a bit on it .
F	i definitely had not , i spent over_£_00 and it said free post .
F	disappointed at delay in delivery but easy to contact , pleasant staff and the product is good .
M	i have never had the worst dealings with a company in my entire life !
M	decided to fumigate a small caravan i just purchased .
M	while the champagne is fine , the courier managed to deliver to the wrong house .
M	staff were very helpful with queries , delivery went_smoothly and the multi_cutter i bought was excellent value .
F	delivery note the following_day stated they had been left on the garage .
M	recently i have had several bad_experiences not with ebuyer but with the delivery company they use .
M	it '_s out there , why not expand the range ?
M	very informated to us
F	love the way the foliage was sprayed gold to match the orange and autumn coloured arrangement .
M	just a small order in comparison - but treated quickly and the despatch arrangements were highly efficient and honed to perfection .
M	best to go_elsewhere whilst they sort themselves out .
M	so they promise you a " dedicated account_manager ", and yet that person doesn_'_t exist as far as i can tell .
M	my wife and i are oaps and we had to really struggle to get the cardboard off , fold it , store and then manoeuvre the heavy bookcase into place .
M	especially in the whisky category .
M	very comfortable and great value for money .
F	after putting my call on hold for a long time , she then said there was nobody available to provide the information .
F	great service from this company , they provide excellent customer service .
F	everything was good , except for additional_fees for different credit_cards , but other that the service was good .
F	i tried them both on but they werent right for me .
M	alladins_cave of pens and pencils second to none . superb web_site and delivery system .
F	however , if like me you work and are unable to sit on the site at the exact time they go on sale you usually miss out on the best stuff .
F	so from order to satisfaction it was almost a month .
M	i recently_purchased an iphone off ebay and the seller chose to ship using collect_+.
M	my lawyer friend drafted a letter for me giving them until 0st december before we place a claim in a london small_claims court for breach of contract , we sent it recorded delivery but " surprisingly " they could not find the letter so had to send proof of delivery plus a copy of the documentation via_email to them as well .
M	dont get the argos_voucher - requires activation on 0000 number - pricey if you do it on a mobile - and 00hr notice as well - a real_pain when your voucher isnt for a lot of money anyway !
F	but if the items are not in stock , which i have been told after i placed the order , they have not been good at letting_me know when i might expect delivery .
M	giffgaff need a more resilient model and should think about whether their model is capable of offering a professional , resilient service .
F	i have always suspected jiggerypookery in our lottery since they refused to let richard branson take over and give more to players and charity . i hope i live long enough to see the sh ** hit the fan and those who are ripping_off the money brought to book
F	the car infact took 0_weeks to just reach the supplier , i then had to wait 00 working_days for a cooling_off period before the car could be delivered to me .
F	i would use them every time .
F	if the bank doesn_'_t know the customer is due a refund , the customer wont get a refund !
M	we wait but any joy has now gone as can we really trust them to do a good job ?
M	waited over two_weeks for them to be delivered .
F	i was pleasantly_surprised when my order arrived within two_days .
M	0 attempts now to deliver time sensitive items , i ordered frozen fish_food during the bank_holiday_weekend , knowing it would not be sent out until the tuesday .
M	not what i was expecting considering how much i paid for them .
F	we ( parents ) were told that our children would have ' studio shots ' taken which would be of professional quality .
M	i feel i ` ve been stitched up like a kipper with top tier tickets that should be middle or lower tier and unable to speak to anyone about it .
F	extremely disappointed as my family , in london did not receive their gift as indeed my aunt did not .
M	so i emailed customer service and to be fair the guy_who dealt_with my complaint was very professional and explained why my items had been delayed and offered to split my order so i could receive part of my order .
F	we have recently placed an order with oak_furniture_land -
M	because everything worked ok i have just ordered an sd memory card for my camera from offtek .
F	so , despite my unhappiness with the tallboy and the sofabed , three stars !
M	their tyre selection is excellent and the price is very competitive .
F	i have bought two_sets of bedding from bedeck , the quality appearance is luxurious honestly the best i have seen within my affordability .
F	i don_'_t think so !
M	i sent it back for a refund but apparently they never received it ???
M	tuesday some stuff came .
M	only wish the site had a wider_selection at the time of ordering , but we can '_t have everything !
M	both of us ended_up taking our items to our local_stores .
F	ordered flowers at the last_minute and they were delivered the next_day ( on a sunday ).
M	the money (£_000 ) was taken out of my account the following_day .
F	imagine my dismay when on friday december 00th i received an_email from iflorist informing_me that they were not able to deliver my order before january 0th !
F	ma_commande a été livrée comme prévue , et_en bonne condition !
M	i ordered online from justoffbase and although the website shows stock they did not have any and no planned stock so they refunded my money .
F	we ended_up having to go to the travel_lodge hotel instead which alright was only 0 minutes_walk extra but the stress would '_ve been easily avoided if communication would '_ve been sent via_email soon as it was booked .
F	will be using you again !
M	the order was for some spare bulbs for a bell push .
M	excellent !
M	got stung on import_taxes for a quarter of the price of the original camera , meaning i would have been better off buying in the uk .
F	i would use it over and over again , if i had that many old_phones !
M	overall though i received the codes i bought and they worked so ive no_complaints there but i would hope this company will look into other ways to verify users without having to share confidential information .
F	however , i had a few simple questions about the train line .
F	ordered a replacement track for my mother , which came very quickly .
M	the average wait time is about 00_mins .
F	sorry to say ??
M	my parcel was collected the day after the booking and delivered the following_day as promised . i would definitely use them again .
M	we booked well in advance to select a villa rather_than a specific country or region that would meet our diverse extended family needs and were disappointed that this villa and our second choice were both withdrawn over the following months having booked and paid a sizable deposit .
F	if only order accepted delivery witin 00_hrs then silence debit appeared in bank_account but no meds and no emails so very unhappy i contacted customer_services at this point they were excellent seems emails_telling_me i needed to speak to a doctor were in spam logged back in and had to communicate with doctor via a chat box which was a nightmare as it kept cutting off my paragraphs finally had order confirmed but meds still took 0_days now i know !
M	it takes 0 days and ticking for parcelforce to deliver custom notice with the depot 0 miles from my doorstep .
F	however after a week had past and no correspondence from them we were concerned .
F	sadly , however postage was £ 0 which suddenly ceased being a cheap option to buying from shop .
M	awesome !
M	ent paideia the
F	this led to frustration and wasted time .
F	in my case they accepted my offer and gave_me a personal discount_code to input at checkout which all went_smoothly .
F	i chose free delivery and was impressed and pleased at how quickly they were delivered .
M	our customer service team will contact you as soon as it is completed .
M	never had a problem ordering from battery_force .
M	my wife is thrilled with the pearls as a present and i am_delighted by the service and amazing value received from the pearl source .
M	they still think we all use internet_explorer !
F	the whole service from mazuma was quick and very easy .
F	couldn_'_t fault it .
F	larger one is heavy and bends down at ends due to weight , very difficult to pull blind up or down .
F	pension adviser nicholas pratt dealt_with all enquiries in a timely_manner as we were working to a deadline to get all paperwork signed before we went away on an extended holiday .
F	apart_from the delivery problems i was very pleased with the service and would consider_using this company again if they were to change their delivery policy !
F	they gladly took my money for the hire of a limo for my daughter '_s prom however , only when i called two_days before the event just to confirm that all was still ok with the booking , did they advise me that they are not able to honour the booking as they do not have a vehicle !
F	but , i whimpered , is there nothing you can do .
M	this is unfair trading and targets vulnerable subscribers .
M	this company is the most devious i '_ve come_across , and i thought amazon were bad !
M	i ordered and paid for strimmer online not a problem .
F	nothing to do with the product but down to the packaging and despatch
F	i asked to find out why items i received are different to picture and if i can get_hold of the product on the website .
M	i paid for a parcel to be delivered and as far as i know , you did !
M	my order turned_up on time and in full , i was then contacted afterwards to check if i was happy .
M	very poor customer has_been given by fitting_centre .
M	and if you make several trips a year , often with the same people , and to different places , an annual_policy prices appear to be great value .
F	i have ordered from us companies several_times on - line with no_problems and i believe this company had no_intention of sending me a replacement and they certainly never refunded my money .
M	i was very happy with the case when it arrived . it looks great , you just can '_t get great unique designs like this in the uk .
F	i felt it should have been them contacting me about the delay not me contacting them .
F	i was told my item would arrive between 0 - 0_days .
F	the almonds i purchased tasted really bitter .
M	technical back up and dealer support is excellent .
F	i ordered some flowers for a special_occasion , my grandmothers 00th_birthday .
F	the ombudsman '_s service took up my case but unfortunately , talktalk were able to refer to the small_print of the contract , refuting several facts that i know occurred , but they denied .
M	my lenses have arrived and on time but , in line with all other topcashback comments , i have yet to see if the credit will be added to my account .
M	tried to call on monday with no joy .
M	they phoned cpw customer_services for me , then physically walked next door with me to cpw to sort it out .
M	and all that given that the ferry was far from reaching load apacity
M	i therefore used another excess_insurance provider ( questor ).
M	more then happy to deal with them again & will recommend to friends .
M	item great , price great , let_down by delivery company who dropped it and damaged the corner !
M	perfect for a dslr and extras with room for a laptop
F	all in all - excellent
F	definitely recommend the pillows .
M	amazon , eglobal and many other online traders can deliver but value basket just cannot .
M	there you have it in a nutshell - studio dont_know who they buy from so they have you waiting in for a delivery but they dont_know who it is delivering it or when its going to come .
M	this used to work fine , and showed me that talk_talk was slower_than all other services , but as a pensioner who does not play_games or illegal downloads it '_s adequate and the " price is right ".
F	the cleaner arrived really quickly and i enjoyed testing the product .
M	will not be using again .
M	i sent an email to viagogo to inform them of this , that it has_been more than 00_hours and no confirmed ticket , so consider the order cancelled .
F	unfortunately i was disappointed with the service provided .
F	it was ordered on friday , and i got an_email later that day to say it had been dispatched .
M	been full flu and with a number of other projects pressing i needed more time to consider the price .
F	true to her word they arrived in plenty of time .
F	would definitely recommend chocolate_trading company and i will be using them again in the future .
M	the on - line shipping cost is simple to understand and is extremely competitive .
F	i could have needed these items urgently .
F	we check all the wooden pieces .
F	i placed my order on 00 march_0000 .
M	email_updates on the progress of the order were timely .
F	i find that whilst the products are good at a competitive price and well_packaged they fall_short on effective communications .
M	i phoned kenable & specifically_asked for a dvi_cable to link 0 monitor to 0 computers since i was unable to see the required product on the webpage .
F	refer to your email 00 - 00 - 00 you were unable to provide my order .
F	affordable , quick and stress_free .
F	the website was easy to navigate , and the ordering simple .
M	i received a note saying delivered to a friend which i queried and found it impossible to get clarified in serenatas system .
M	have used hi fix for a number of years .
F	after discussion with a manager i finally got them to let_me return the nest for free as i had not just changed my mind about the purchase but the coffee and nest were bought for the one room and one without the other was pointless .
F	they said they would phone back .
M	rang customer service who said they can '_t help or reinstate offer .
M	i purchased an item from lindy . uk and completed the transaction , including the credit_card approval .
F	thank_you for a wonderful service .
F	if i could give zero_stars i would .
M	ended_up ordering contact_lenses for only my right eye and then discovered they were the wrong lenses as well .
F	i rang up and all they had to say was that ' they must have got lost ' awesome customer service !
M	future dealings with webuy . com cex ?
M	easy online ordering_process .
F	also paid for next week delivery only to be told the next_day that it wasn_'_t possible and now looking at a month for delivery so don_'_t trust them re delivery dates .
F	what i got in return was a half page in some foreign_language , possibly swedish .
M	good website easy to use .
M	absolutely pathetic service .
M	i have used these_guys for my last few pairs of glasses and went for a reglaze this time round , very fast service , great product and i still look good !
M	all ok except lid of product broken into lots of pieces and therefore unable to reseal the gel dispenser rendering product unusable
F	it turns_out the courier was going to the flat downstairs contrary to my 0st floor_flat instructions .
M	why pay full price when you can go to cjs !
F	for example the bottoms of the drawers and back of both items , though made of oak were the thinnest pieces you could use .
M	:)
F	it arrived well_packaged , and in super condition , and without_doubt would use again
M	one point i would make .
M	awful company . even worse customer service !
M	this cover would fit over 0 of them !
F	well_done - i will be ordering again .
F	they were delivered less_than 00_hours after i placed the order and we needed them urgently so really appreciated the service .
F	the house was quite literally a building site with construction workers starting at 0am every day to replace the roof of the adjoining property .
M	so i cancelled the order before the end of july .
M	the advisor was rude and unprofessional .
M	have bought from them before and will buy again .
M	poor company . poor standards !
M	caveat_emptor .
M	ordered our tickets on - line , received this within the week - and we ' re in the isle of man - things usually take a lot longer_than that to get to us .
F	i have asked to return it under my statutory_rights ( distant marketing directive ) and because not as advertised .
M	the title_says it all .
F	can you imagine our horror finding out after 0pm on a sunday_night that your entire food order had been cancelled ?
M	stuff like the beef liver tablets with added b00 so customers can ' feel ' the effects is misleading its not something they would have done a couple years_ago .
F	i found the website very easy to use , the returns process was so easy and the refund was processed swiftly .
F	i '_ll keep this brief .
M	my tax_disk had gone_missing and about £ 0 had been stolen from my money tray .
M	i was told it would be too expensive so it would need to be monday . they arrived following_monday .
M	happy with the goods but the company seems to be based in gib - this may account for slower_than_expected deliveries .
F	no ferries needed .
M	i emailed trustpiolot several days ago asking them how rigorous their procedures are in validating reviewers and to date i have not had a response .
M	david : yes you were on friday i had a live_chat and it was confirmed .
M	after_reading the instructions and comparing it to my car i thought it might be the wrong one for my car .
M	a double whammy hit on the benefits from using a tesco credit_card .
M	it seems that once they have your details , they are going to keep taking money whether you are an active subscriber or not .
F	!
M	with in 0 days of using the glue mouse_traps , we were able to rid our house of 0 mice , caught within a few hours of each other .
M	i will not use this company again nor would i recommend it .
F	i lost_0lb the first week but since then i couldnt bear going to the fridge & having the meals staring back at me .
F	the packaging that the items come in is a bit of a joke .
M	next time we used car was to go into cape_town & that '_s when problem_arose .
F	she then tells_me that i wasn_'_t at home when the driver stopped by .
F	company and they told me some other things to try .
M	i ' d not have wanted to lose out on the £_000 that mazuma gave_me for my iphone .
M	its like having no insurance at all when you come to claim unless you have receipts for everything you brought 0 years_ago , have your baggage strapped to your body constantly via locked chains or by not moving from your hotel . ever .
F	he refused to come to us , but luckily the other people agreed to go to him to get the tickets ( despite the torrential_rain !)
M	what frustrated me further was that i would probably have to wait for most of the next_day waiting again .
F	!
M	avoid . avoid . avoid !
F	excellent delivery and product
M	two items did no turn_up the next_day .
M	i only spoke to some one trying to retain me and told them i wanted to leave !
M	it is also much noisier than it was advertised to be .
F	great service
M	he explained everthing most clearly and did not pressure us in any way .
M	so we see how it goes :) my iva was quick and simple to sort_out with the help they gave_me about 0_weeks it took
F	chose to have my item collected by one a courier .
M	i live in surrey and cannot understand_why my parcel would be sent to birmingham .
F	very well made and looks beautiful .
F	however , when i called my friend on her_birthday , i was disappointed to find that the flowers were received in a box and not the bouquet shown on the website .
F	in desperation i called dpd direct and after 0 attempts finally spoke with someone with whom i confirmed the address and contact number again and was guaranteed the recipient would be called and delivery would be arranged .
F	so i paid the fee
F	how is that fair ?
M	offered to send it back to me , how do i no they didnt damage it .
F	don_'_t touch these sharks !
M	a shame that you had to close my local shop .
F	it then shows ' delivery not attempted ' for several days ( i . e .
F	in fact i have recommended viovet to several people .
M	been with them for years , several contracts service can be very frustrating as they go from absolutely_brilliant ( recent upgrade dealings with wales and manilla ) to absolutely shambolic ( manilla ) tech call lasting 00_mins brilliant , tech call moments before cut_off after 0 min hold ( agent did not know how , so i listened to them type for for at_least 00_mins before they put the phone down .
M	but wait . where the ' eck is my solvent ?
F	also wasnt happy when i had no reply after stating something was missing .
F	please do take my advice and never buy anything from this hopeless company – if anything_goes_wrong you will never be able to resolve it with them .
F	it was unnecessary_packaging as it only cost £ 0 for my mother to post it over to me in denmark , unscratch .
F	delivery arrived as promised
F	also their returns_policy is a bit_strange , you have to pay to have them pick_up the returned item even if the item is small enough to bring it back to the shop yourself .
F	i learned that the label with the bouquet gave only my christian_name as the sender .
F	i weill not be recommending you to anybody which is such a shame because the quality of your furniture is good .
M	i should have been able to do all of this within the one booking .
F	everyone has to earn a living .
F	but they don_'_t have any customer service .
M	i have been a customer of firstaid0sports for 0 years_now and don_'_t buy my athletic tape or braces from anywhere_else .
F	every delivery date promised is not fulfilled and they are just incompetent .
F	did nothing to help !
F	easy to use , great rates and speedy transfer .
M	no reply for wiggle for a week !
F	ordered products , almost_half the price compared to high_street shops .
M	they missed the dead line and i can not wait in another 00_hours for a no show .
M	the breakfast at the restaurant next door was brilliant and set us up for the day .
M	great idea , great concept and beautifully_presented .
M	many labels .
M	never use these_clowns ever .
M	would use this company again .
F	the procedure took less_than a minute i think in total and i was seeing things i '_d never seen before within a few hours !
F	delivery is always prompt and the products seem great quality - the msm tablets are working wonders for me !
F	et_je vois le sav se dégrader au fil des années .
M	got pissed_off with crap dispatch times with crc !
F	product was good , although as this is a family run business was disapointed with the delivery times . paid for second class and nothing had arrived 00 days_later chased and they said they were very busy .
F	hi ,
F	i received an_email_saying what day my item would be delivered and it never came .
M	really very very good .
F	i don_'_t understand_why they don_'_t have better quality control .
F	the issue is somone having the willingness , authority and sense of responsibility to constructively work with the customer to sort the problem out .
F	good reliable service and they always pay out on time .
F	only to waste my time and petrol as it was to come in at0000 that day .
F	customer service agent then advised that i should pay for my order cash to which i replied " that kind of defeats the purpose of having a credit account doesn_'_t it ".
F	it was esay to use its just a shame that tickets are allowed to be sold for ridiculous prices when the originals can be brought for a much much_lower price .
F	great price , great blinds and good service the first time i ordered .
M	we have always gone to them due to the great customer_care , competitive price and large vehicle choice and good vehicle condition .
M	!
F	you can easily choose brand_name or generic , which is handy .
M	i guess overall it was still delivered fairly swiftly but i ' d rather have not had a notification saying it was due the first time round if it wasn_'_t going to turn_up .
F	if anyone from xdp express reads this , you really need to sort yourselves out , take_note how dhl , yodel , royal_mail and all the other delivery businesses work cos somewhere you ' re going badly wrong .
F	i will be using amazon in future .
F	i emailed customer_services 0_days ago with feedback .
F	i ordered yumove for my dog at 00 . 00pm on thursday_night and it arrived by royal_mail post 0 . 00am saturday_morning .
M	first_impressions look interesting .
M	other than that issue 00 / 00
F	the print quality of the photos was fine but the size was smaller_than the one i '_d asked for .
M	highly_recommended .
F	the website is very easy to use and good descriptions .
F	purchased redken all soft conditioner 0000ml , a really great size at a really great price , as long as they have this product in stock i will definitely shop there again .
M	ordered online , easy to find products and easy to pay .
M	!
M	furthermore i didn_'_t notice that this particular carpark is un - manned and you have to take your keys with you .
M	very pleased and i recommend bath_empire to any one .
F	again , nothing was too much_trouble .
F	prices are competitive and delivery speedy .
M	finally got my delivery from the us .
M	the store manager made her wait standing at customer_services for over an_hour while he went and checked cctv which happened to show she never entered the aisle with the expensive product she had been charged for was stocked .
F	a phone_call would '_ve been a tad quicker .
M	all of this was refunded .
F	however it was a powershot sd 000 which was sent , which is the us version of the same camera , complete with us battery_charger .
M	we have a wealth of information available online , please visit our help and advice pages to learn more and to manage your account .
F	los precios eran buenos aunque la entrega en 0 dias laborables es un poco largo en otras paginas entregan con mas rapidez
F	my flat looks great .
F	what '_s more the cologne was delivered in the time frame stated .
M	goodbye healthspan you will not get another order from me .
F	i explained to him that i had used the redial and therefore this confirmed that i had called them .
F	fine .
F	that '_s not to say i '_m giving up on exante but perhaps supplying ready_meals that you mix with water is a mistake .
M	i used to use you very time when ordering items online .
M	well it was good that my flowers turned_up and was ok to send next door . hopefully next time you could let the receiver address know they have flowers next door ? a little note as i sent a message to say have she received my present . she received a day later and the flowers where nice , which is a positive .
M	whenever we have bought phones through carphone_warehouse there have been problems when it comes to a ) cancelling contract at the end of the term , b ) sorting_out problems with the phones .
F	my wife passed the phone to me i asked darren why you could not have used another vehicle .
F	on emailing carphone_warehouse they told me i wasn_'_t entitled to the free gift .
F	avoid tesco .
F	i started by getting lost near airport after calling you a driver met me and escorted me to your car_park area
M	a great service .
F	no call .
M	i prefer lonely planet anytime as they never get it wrong .
F	it is now 00 . 0 . 00 and according to their website , my items are in progress .
F	slabs themselves were good quality , however on unpacking there were 0 broken slabs .
M	i turned_up for pre_- booked appointment .
M	delivery was very quick , although the driver did have to phone my partner to find her address , which spoilt the surprise somewhat - he could have phoned me or just checked google_maps etc .
F	i think that although this diet is helping_me stay on track when it comes to caloric intake , the food is severely lacking .
F	luckily they were collected the next_day and did arrive on the day i hoped they would .
F	!
M	my 00 year_old_vhs_tapes with me playing cricket at the oval were quickly transferred on dvd for my children to laugh at !
M	this was my fault , of course .
F	i plan to order from these again and have recommended them to friends and family
M	i emailed the store to complain and say i would keep the cd_player , as it seemed to work , if i could have a small refund back due to their listing error and sending me a cheaper model .
F	about a week after my purchase i started to recieve newsletters , that i did not remember subscribing for .
F	it was very good being_able to receive samples to ensure the bags were suitable for our needs .
F	i would recomend to friends and will use you again .
F	i read a few of the reviews and felt_confident to make my purchase .
F	" the support that you need shall be extended to you shortly "
M	after our weeks holiday we responded to the company '_s feedback request stating that the rented_property did not comply with the company '_s internet still posted advert and advised this could be seen as an issue under trading_standards legislation .
M	thanks
M	told that it wasn_'_t in stock and no details of when it would be available .
F	shock and surprise no delivery so i phone the next_day to find out where it was and told very sorry but they had lied , my order had not been sent out and they would call to let_me know what was going on .
F	a walking_stick was affecting one hip and he still needed to hold my hand with his other hand .
M	in fairness , they emailed me to say it would be delayed - and i decided to hang on .
M	number 00 were still not in but i picked_up the box of print cartridges from their porch .
M	shipment is fast and always well_packed .
F	would recommend to everybody
M	i would not go past this company , their '_s is the best service & their prices for all that i wanted are very competitive , each time the order was there in a few_days , as i said above 0st_class , i will use vet -_medic everytime
F	i then get a letter telling_me that next time if i don_'_t keep the returns tracking_number then i will be charged for the items , i requested that someone ring me regarding this on their contact us page , but no one wants to speak to me in person , i have tried to get the money for the £ 0 of calls made to them for the missing parcels but every time i send them information they want something_else or they want it in a different format . all so i will get fed_up and give up trying to get the money back .
M	terrible service and a rude staff_member .
F	it does not pick_up the leaves on the drive and if it did not have the turbo option dread to think how it would operate .
F	happy with prices too
F	the correct charm was despatched_immediately i made contact but this was after presenting the wrong one as a gift as it came giftwrapped .
M	0 ) shop with victoria_plumb .
M	regards ,
M	i got the vehicle i asked for ( ford_fiesta ) and i paid the price i was originally_quoted but the vehicle had seen better days .
F	i use a wheelchair and still he makes me shift out of the way for him .
F	i would definitely use them again .
F	!
M	the room was clean and comfortable , and the breakfast was nice and hot .
M	villa was very tired looking .
M	ideally i wanted a semisynthetic for a lower price , but it was not possible to choose .
M	a good range of quality products at reasonable prices .
F	when i arrived i looked at and tested about five machines .
M	the composition was bigger than the one in the pic .
M	initially i was sent the wrong product .
M	that aside .
M	i ordered a custom_built_pc fro pc_specialist on 00th_march and received delivery of the pc on 00th_april .
M	absolutely awful !
M	!
F	they weren_'_t even delivered after being told that they were on their way .
M	i have bought a ' shewee ' at the suggestion of a female paddling companion to assist in this , particularly in the cold .
F	you cannot get through on the phone to complain and when you email them it takes days for a reply which is a standard reply and they have no intentions of helping .
F	very very disappointed and will no_longer recommend serenta to anyone :-(
F	delivery was booked for 00 / 00 / 00 and nothing arrived .
M	they offered free returns and the refund was made immediately .
F	to the free delivery to the speed of delivery .
F	i '_ve_used this website a few_times_now and i can_honestly_say that i wouldn_'_t use any other for my set products .
F	item '_s were delivered very quickly , order arrived within two_days , very well_packaged and in tip_top condition , didn_'_t receive a delivery email but not really bothered about this .
M	prices are pretty good though !
F	having taken a day off work , it was a completely wasted day .
F	the company kept me informed by email of the delivery time and despite the snow was only a date late in delivery .
M	' life_changing ' maybe a slight_exaggeration but for someone_who was getting seriously fed_up with glasses and contact_lenses . and the costs , the treatment i had has for me worked really well .
F	however i will be reluctant to pay out several_hundred_pounds on these if they would be packaged in a similar flimsy manner .
M	amazingly awful !
F	best looking at what i need face to face in the future i think rather_than online .
F	this is not the first time i have experienced problems with a delivery by city_link .
M	i re - ordered . and found myself receiving two items .
F	really that simple !
M	worktop_express gave_us the best quote by a long way and the quality was still superb .
F	the price was competitive and delivery free .
F	the day of the treatment was good but within a few_days i was in a lot of pain .
F	they completely_ignored the fact that money had been taken and i had not received a voucher !
F	the flowers actually looked like two small bunches of flowers from a supermarket put_together and for the price i paid £_00 . 00 ( or as near as ) i wasn_'_t impressed .

M	i was recommended to use maxiraw about 00 months_ago and found the service to be excellent and the products to match .
M	very good .
M	i am now pursuing them through my bank and most_likely will go through small_claims .
F	although the small_print stated that this was not guaranteed , rentalcars did not even pass the request onto the car_hire company .
F	when i call to cancel , the agent said she was processing the cancellation , but when i checked on the website , it still depicted that the collection had been processed and myhermes agent would come and collect the parcel .

M	well_done .
M	the manual would be very welcome .
F	basically they are not interested they have got the money for the flowers , they dont care how and when they are delivered .
F	i really cannot overstate how easy it all was .
M	my recommendation is to take time to carefully inspect the products on delivery and run your hands over the complete surface is essential to check they are flat .
M	completely_unhelpful line staff and managers - i wouldn_'_t recommend this lot to anyone .
M	at 0000 on the 00 / 00 / 00 after not having had a response from myukdelivery since 00 . 00 i emailed saying

M	there was not one lilly at all in the flowers , and these were substituted with the worst flower of all in a carnation .
M	arrived super quick and super correct .
F	good , quick close to what virgin_media advertised anyway
M	items arrived on time and as_described - what more can you ask ?
M	orders placed to date have turned into a delivery nightmare !
F	i checked the last order dates for the product and thought i was still in time .
F	in a nutshell i don_'_t trust them any more , from the quality of their food to their slogans / bargains - and why should i have to use facebook to lodge an opinion ?
M	underarm zips also work well when ventilation required .
F	when we got there ( it '_s a long drive ) we found that my ring had been made the complete wrong_size .
M	well i said , the system your using doesn_'_t work , the lady replied that '_s head offices central log not ours .
M	( don_'_t you just hate it when companies can '_t be_bothered and don_'_t care enough to answer their customers calls !).
F	when i saw on your site that it was free_postage if you spent over_£_00 . 00 .
F	we are really pleased with our usbs .
M	no problem with the chinese made products but having purchased a number of
M	i also noticed that the email was " sent automatically , therefore it is possible you have received this before your package or service ".
M	what great value and quality .
F	what is a concern is that my porch was closed and windows closed as i work !!
M	overall good but had a few issues with out of stock items and wrong information via_email etc .
M	the service i received was very good flowers where deliveried as expected and they looked lovely on day 0 by day 0 which was christmas day the roses had died even know we had put them in a clean vase the day before .
M	nice smooth_transaction - speedy service - good product
F	i received my spices as ordered very quickly and they are already in use .
F	as if that wasn_'_t bad enough , one parcel of ten painting is now " lost , and will not be found ".
F	they tried to deliver days_later when i was not at home to sign , so i had to go to the nearest post deposit to retrieve the package .
M	does anyone listen at hermes .
M	i had an issue with my phone and emailed them for a follow_up . of which i am still_awaiting a reply and that is now 0_weeks .
F	they have good prices but their customer_services could improve
F	it wasn_'_t very good before the update but it is no better now - shame !
M	got foam out .
F	while i almost always get everything i want , there are times when they are out of stock on an item and they have not charged for it , a good thing .
F	have emailed twice but no refund !
F	service was good but product disappointing
M	it really doesnt cost £ 0 . 00 to post a small trophy !
F	i very much recommend fakeidboss !
F	they have , nt got it .
F	i paid £ 0 . 00 for the postage which i thought was reasonable .
M	hi just placed an order with this web_site physioroom , stuff was dispatched on the 00 of aug its now the 00th still no order has arrived , heading off on holiday now for a couple of weeks in a bit pain so will be a while before i get my order or if i get it very disappointed .
M	i '_ve_used this service twice_now and both_times it '_s worked_perfectly would recommend to anyone .
F	i had contacted them the same day the payment was processed and yet my phone had already " gone " and could not be returned to me .
M	incredibly i haven_'_t received yet this item .
F	they are the biggest bedding company yada yada .
M	i can '_t bear to listen to the incomplete information that constantly pours from this iniquitous company , they have taken trust that was built up over many_years and have totally abused it .
F	i also asked for details of someone at the company more senior i could direct my complaint to and was ignored
F	my first purdchase was , i have to admit instigated by price - so much_cheaper_than the annual_fee i had been paying to my optician .
F	they managed fairly easily why could the men paid to do that job do it ?
M	i was a little disappointed because the previous books i have had reproduced very well and now i am very reluctant about having any further crewe albums printed in the future .
M	arrived at depot ( reading service centre ) 00th_dec_0000 00 : 00
F	hope you can help me .
F	however , a few of the magnets are slightly dirty as it seems it been stack on one on another while the ink is not dry .
M	boomkat , redeye , mirage0000 , phonica , juno , bleep all do not have the need to put stickers on , so you shouldnt either .
F	as emails are unanswered and assurance via the telephone unfulfilled .
F	i don_'_t normally_write_reviews on websites , but this was by far the worst customer service i have ever received and so i felt_compelled to share my experience and warn other consumers to think_twice before they make their purchase from here .
F	ordering was easy and when i realised i had put my address instead of my parents i quickly sent them an_email asking them to change it which they did quickly before the battery was delivered .
M	from my experiences in other company i have money back for those item and they charge me when item was in stock again .
F	i spoke to [_name_] who seemed to have resolved other complaints on here .
F	i returned the unit as it was not as_described on their web - site , paying the carriage , but because it was not actually faulty kikatek would not re - pay the carriage_costs .
M	waited another 0_weeks . still no refund . chap on phone was very rude as i paid by card , and not on account " how can you have purchased from us if you dont have an account number ?"
M	the second point is : we are a pub .
F	i was given a time_slot which allowed me to pick free delivery and delivery on a saturday
F	not the largest order was placed but i was treated as if i was a ' big ' customer .
M	we managed to sort it out in the end ourselves .
M	have used a few_times before and will use again and again .
F	wally arrived at 0 . 00am , when i said i expected him earlier he complained he had to come from luton .
F	since then , i have found that most products i need are available here , and all at excellent prices , though at times , if one wants to make a small purchase , the postage is a little prohibitive .
F	everything i wanted for my daughter '_s party was available and arrived very quickly .
M	well_worth the cost and very durable and warm without getting too hot when walking hard .
M	i '_ve tried one other service and i waited over a week for the money .
F	keep_up the good work !
F	it does not reflect well on you !
M	phoned 0 days before installing for advice received no reply
F	ordered a beautiful bunch of flowers for my friend , the bunch she received looked nothing like the bunch i paid for .
M	?
F	had to cancel order .
F	would thoroughly_recommend .
M	the second wardrobe replacement had one side of the front_door which showed panels and in particular a very dark panel , whilst the right hand door did not have the panel feature , the result is we have two odd doors which do not match .
F	i will definitely not be using expedia again .
M	numerous_times we have had parcels delivered by myherpes through people on ebay .
M	except when it takes time to load .
F	due to this we were informed we could choose another sofa which could be delivered in time for christmas with £_00 compensation added on due to their mistake great !!!!
M	ordered first thing on a monday , received last thing on friday after calling up to ensure it would arrive .
F	sideboard was damaged , engineer made an attempt to fix and company offered £_00 discount which again we never received .
F	!
M	the medication my dog requires is still cheaper when buying two of the medication compared to the vet '_s single one .
M	will_definitely recommend !
F	it cost us £_00 00p online if we paid on the night it would have cost us which it was on the card we got for the room it was £_00 00 p . so we wont_be staying at your hotel again i dont accept the terms but i have to tick because it wont send
F	very pleased with the price and service !
F	they have no regards for customer_satisfaction and are unreliable and unhelpful in every way .
F	then they closed the dispute and stopped_talking .
F	great communication and very efficient service .
M	i thought they ' d just replace the chainset and discuss the warranty with shimano separately .
F	i probably_wouldn_'_t recommend this company unless they change delivery method .
F	delivery wasnt that quick but ok .
F	i buy clothes for my daughter , nieces and nephews as well as my self and always thought their clothing was of a good standard .
M	thankyou very much and good luck for the future .
M	this trip i did very little driving and had no option to return the car with half a tank of fuel .
F	this is the second time we have used this parking company .
F	i find you dont get this with other insurance .
M	what do you do ?
F	was assured would be with me on 0 / 00 .
M	i complained about this to the nice and helpful cutomer service .
F	a pity because you offer a fabulous service and the work itself was done without fault .
F	the order was now due for 0_days time ( considering i had ordered at 0 , 00 ) - but regardless it didn_'_t arrive until another 0_days after that - with the product that had run_out of stock .
F	will definitely be selling my blackberry when my contract_ends !
F	.
F	queries before ordering where dealt_with promptly .
M	thanks colin
F	my experience of delivery and processing a return was good - all very speedy and no_problems .
F	again i have ordered the item , but to date have not received it .
M	i had issues maybe a 0 - 0 times a month and for a week at a time .
F	!
M	making the transaction however was a bit hi - n - miss .
M	the canna lilies are still going_strong after 00 days but we had to dispose of the roses after a week as they were dead , and in some cases , rotten .
F	!
M	so adding 0 more days on to that will make it a full week since i placed my order !!
M	all i wanted to do was buy a new line into the house so my teenage_son had his own phone and have my office line moved from the house to a home office i had built in the garden .
M	i am sorry to say but the vice is not very well made when not locked it wobbles all over the place and there is no datum line for the degree scale so is pointless to have the scale .
F	this arrived quickly and was well_packaged .
M	would use again .
F	thank_you
M	so who have you passed our details to ?
F	order dealt_with quickly , well_packaged & arrived as_described .
F	what i can say is that the box arrived damaged , so i only hope it is ok .
F	i have nothing to write and not very happy
F	only other issue was that when trying to read other reviews or location details from a selected parking company , the screen would not scroll_down and therefore , i could not view all the information .
M	all the best
M	returns are also mega easy with the pre_- paid postage .
M	if you want value for money , then argos is the place to be .
F	i wouldn_'_t use serenata_flowers again .
M	i was poorer than a low power guitar_amp purchased a long time ago .
M	didn_'_t ask for swift delivery so it took just over a week to arrive .
M	which idiot actually leave their phone lying_around so it can be stolen ?
F	it arrived_safely so i suppose that is a good thing !
F	took it back , oh there is a leak !
F	also i found the support_team disinterested in the fact that my order was wrong .
F	i have tried_ringing them 0 times only to be kept hanging on listening to awful music then dialing tone again then they cut you off , don_'_t suppose i will get a refund now , so my advise to every one out there is avoid using this site
F	as ever i was delighted with the service i have received from serenata_flowers .
F	so easy and less queues dropping_off than at post_office .
F	had a problem with tickets ordered on a journey from bath to london .
F	this was probably due to the software because after i deleted , then re - installed it i had no further problems .
M	it took 0 months to arrive to the uk
F	excellent service fast delivery arrived on time and it wheelchair was just what i expected lightweights and very easy for me to handle getting in and out of the car
M	they are very comfortable .
M	we booked a hotel in benidorm and when we got there we were not booked in .
M	excellent jacket , brilliant price and delivery within_00hrs .
M	they wanted me to pay carriage on way back for the mistake .
F	consequently , i bought an organiser at a local shop .
F	sorry greenpod , such awful service for you will mean i never order from you again .
F	very easy site to use and rugby shirt promptly arrived a couple of days_later .
M	absolutely perfect .
F	the quality of the photos is outstanding .
M	the service is fine but the site can be a bit_confusing .
M	overall , we would rather see no discounts and the money saved by not offering those discounts put into increasing the pack size .
M	i was in 0 out of the 0 times they claim to have been around to my address !!
F	great firm to deal with on the ball and very good gear quality stuff
M	quite_frankly i hesitate using the flyerzone again , which is a shame as service standards are high .
F	i would not use this company for flowers , the customer service is awful and virtually_impossible to get_hold of and your flowers won_'_t even arrive !
M	i had to buy a few components including wireless and the instructions from the manufacturer where in some cases not the easiest to understand .
F	i didn_'_t see it until 0_days after it had been delivered and my initial impression was that for £_00 it was very small !
F	speedy dispatch .
M	can '_t get better_than that !!
F	would highly_recommend to anyone who_wants to make a difference to their lives .
M	from_start to finish your company is a at the very least a 0_star organisation in every_aspect , it has_been an_absolute_pleasure to deal with you and i hope to again in the future .
M	however , as i had not received anything by friday 00th_october i phoned the spares department and after a discussion regarding the order number , the parts were dispatched and i received them next_day on saturday .
M	the is especially annoying when the sizing of the products are way out from what is offered and the cost is absorbed by the customer
M	also what you said to the other person_who gave you 0_star " we are in the enviable position of not having to chose to deal with every customer who comes to our site ."
M	always a bit_wary of what you are going to get from internet purchases , but the quality was great and the service & delivery i couldn_'_t fault .
F	up size it if you can .
F	when my partner asked to speak to a manager or a supervisor , he was conveniently told they were in a meeting until close of the call_centre and a call back would be scheduled for between 00 and 00_hours .
M	not delivered !!!
F	and try as i might to make contact with a human_being , i failed woefully , as each time i quoted my new number upon request , i was told to wait_until monday !
M	looks good but the proof is in the eating .
M	the number of times i '_ve no shows from potential sellers who expressed a burning desire to want what was for sale is legion .
F	delivery guys were great .
F	sent these to a friend - she said they were ' nice ', and smelt lovely .
M	by the time we realised it wasn_'_t going away we ' d already gone over 0000 miles , which is all they allow for under warantee .
F	all the staff at u . k credit were more than helpful and professional .
M	also selling fees are stupidly high !
F	an_email was sent to advise of my concern .
M	i ordered a bathroom_taps , cistern and other bits - the goods were delivered speedily and arrived on a pallet and is of good quality - however i got charged_twice on my credit_card .
F	the delivery of each order has let the whole_thing down - boxes left on doorsteps , behind the bin etc .
F	an item within my order was received with the security_tag still attached .
F	excellent service and very helpful when i called with a question .
F	i have two small pkts of 0 tablet .
M	i was promised a phone_call from a manager which i never got , which just shows how much they really care .
M	tooled_- up . com came up best price and delivered quickly , great result .
F	it is now approaching 0pm and i have heard_nothing .
F	order promptly processed and distributed and i would have no_hesitation in using them again .
F	this turned into a complete_nightmare .
M	excellent and prompt service .
F	i had a quick response saying they would be shipped the next_day , not sure why they weren_'_t in the first place when they were in stock .
M	phil
F	ordered on line , delivered on time and courier had box in very good condition
F	she loved them and said they were absolutely_beautiful .
M	this i found very confusing .
M	this is a bit of a con , had i know this i would not have made the purchase .
F	they need a representative at the concert to sort_out late ticket problems .
M	they gave_us time to consider the product on offer and answered any questions i put to them .
M	other than that this was a good place to get a pc from .
M	so we get their guy out to visit for an easy sale as mum needed blinds for her new apartment , and we were recommended the firm by the new building manager . ( bad mistake ).
M	if you appreciate up to date facts , results and general nascar information , then you have to visit this website .
F	have had a credit account for two months and owe only £_00 .
M	waste if money
M	very professional service from strat to finish
F	several days of parcel0go telling_me that " myhermes would not respond within 00_hours " ensued .
F	i paid for express delivery so that my goods would arrive within 0 / 0_days . it took 0_days for my item to be delivered .
M	not ideal .
F	message :
M	thank_you i am really pleased with the price and the quality of the product .
F	brilliant rapid service
F	looking at the delivery log they said they tried to deliver on the 0th day , the non - delivery excuse was " no access " and repeated once again on the 0th .
F	very disappointed and will not use again .
F	overall nice but not a lot for your money .
M	i spent about 00_minutes setting it up on the phone , but the first order got lost so luckily i called back the next_day to check .
M	brilliant website and fast delivery but lack of communication took the gloss of a bit .
F	as christmas is saturday , leaving it 0_days for it still not to arrive is leaving it far too late .
M	thank_you .
M	the email_notifications are brilliant , the delivery was perfect and all the info provided is great for if you aren_'_t sure sure how to do the work . and plenty of opportunity for further support is offered all along the way .
F	there was a delay as the glasses as a 0st set of lenses had failed quality checks and we had to reorder another pair of the lenses .
F	sadly i can only give them a 0_star_rating because 0_weeks_later , i am still_waiting for a response from them .
M	was told the cotbed would arrive at 0 . 00pm so waited in for the delivery only to have a call after this time saying delivery driver was in penzance and wouldn_'_t get to me .
F	/ got my kitten in august_0000 and began using petplanet straight_away , i was very impressed by the quality of goods , customer service and prompt delivery .
F	i have placed a couple of orders with beauty_bay the last one was supposed to be next_day delivery which i paid_extra for when it did not arrive i rang customer service was told sorry it was not despatched as dpd not collected i was told that i would be a refund back of the extra i paid - received nothing .
M	you probably_won_’_t be surprised to learn that most issues occur outside of working hours when the majority of people are actually using their internet after coming home from a hard day ’_s work .
F	so , all in all can highly_recommend . only problem trying to hide them until christmas !!!!!!
M	goods matched the website - i got what i wanted
F	bought a bed two_weeks in_advance when moving and bed was due for delivery a week before i moved so i put it back until the day i moved in .

M	i ordered a data cabinet from kenable - had to order 0 times as the first two i selected paypal as the payment type and nothing turned_up .
F	i couldn_'_t have asked for better !
F	a merchant account costs £_00 plus_vat for us customers but £_000 plus_vat for uk customers .
M	he also said i should download naza assistant v0 . 00 .
F	would definitely use urbanara again .
M	the sizes were right and the packaging was minimum .
F	thank_you :-)
M	seller said just tell them at hyde_park ticket office , but they were not interested .

F	i have never used a website so complicated .

M	;)
M	excellent & value for prices
M	0 .
F	to which i have had no reply .
M	thanks to chloe once again !
M	great service and price , delivered exceptionally fast .
M	other than that , they were exactly_what i ordered , of good quality and fitted spot on in my recessed front window which is nearly 00ft wide . they were well_packed and arrived within a reasonable time span .
M	the whole ordeal has_been terrible and considering we spent over £ 0000 on a car what we '_ve had start to finish has_been shockingly_bad , plus now we are stuck with a car that needs to last another 0 years but definately won_'_t without thousands being spent :'( i would say please don_'_t let them make a mug of you too , stay well away and use a company with a more professional_approach who will sell you something you should rightly get for your money and not something that will make life hell or even worse kill you .
F	frustrated .
M	order now turned_up ( monday_morning )!
F	bags were exactly_what i wanted and the perfect size .
M	texts told me flowers had been delivered around 0pm .
M	unfortunately on both_occasions i have had to call and chase up my order .
M	beware there are no nicad batteries included in the sale .
M	as for the photo_book , the photos were reproduced splendidly .
F	very happy .
M	0nd - no one ever saw anyone from dpd .
F	i got my mac code from them and it never worked so i had to outright cancel it .
F	could not fault this company at all .
F	i had trouble with running my photo programmes to get the images i wanted and i '_m_sure i ordered the book in landscape but received a portrait book .
M	i came_across bambino direct and their prices were competetive , their web_site did not suggest anything was out of stock so i ordered over £_000 worth of stuff .
M	i '_ve never had any_problems with them which is the main_reason i keep going back !
F	easy web order , and fast delivery , searching on the site would benefit from improvement , items ordered were as_described online .
M	eventually found click_basin , they had the perfect basin , ticks every box , proportions are fantastic , the customer could not even believe the price , 00 quid , looks more like 000 .
F	( 00kg )
M	i will_defiantly recommend to my work mates .
F	!
M	unfortunately , only 0 arrived the next_day .
M	first order .
M	the drop - off point is a fantastic idea as i no_longer have to wait at home for a courier company to turn_up .
M	with excellent quality food on offer , why oh why don_'_t sainsburys provide enough staff at their checkouts ?
F	i would certainly recommend chemist_direct for all of your pharmacy needs .
F	my advice do not order from this company .
M	i '_ll would never use any other tyre company .
M	i have spoken with jonathan over mail no over the phone .
F	the salesman we dealt_with assured us and sounded very professional about what we had chosen and what we wanted at first !
M	buy with confidence .
M	purchased online a pioneer avh - 0000dab audio system , as the local outlet to me , didnt want to supply ( although i bought leads from them ( wrong type )) and a superb alpine dab aerial .
F	i think the courier let them down , but the service they provided was great .
M	will see if this settles down , if not , i '_ll have to send them back , as suspected faulty , or just a poor product .
M	also if tech 000 or ben feel that my comments are in anyway slanderous or incorrect i would be more than happy for them to persure myself to seek redress for the facts .
M	i bought this item as a birthday_present for my son , i got my sons name engraved on the item and gifted wrapped .
F	will deffo use them again .
M	told it was on the way and i would get a confirmation_email .
M	all in all , i think i have had more problematic deliveries than successful ones from city - link .
F	i even got replies on a weekend .
M	i know these_guys get a bad_reputation for all the things they do and don_'_t do , but so_far i '_ve had an ok experience with them .
M	surely checking the address is correct is a delivery man training school fundamental .
M	very annoying as one of the items was a birthday_present that is now going to be late !
M	excellent work on display and helpful down to earth staff .
M	and bill hand if you write negative_review they will report it to trustpilot , not the positive once though !
F	very disappointed , not a good customer experience at all and you have lost a customer .
M	the bad :
M	i ordered a bow_tie and had it arrive 0 days_later ; the quality was exceptional , and the total price with delivery was only £ 0 .
F	never used them so was sceptical a bit .
F	they arrived_safely and in good time - would heartily_recommend !
M	i checked it myself with a microscope and white image - every pixel was perfect .
F	definitely will be suggesting it to my friends .
M	i am with bt and my contract finishes 00rd_june .
M	needless to say i was amazed that such a large and successful company should have such poor customer service and i wrote back to tell them so .
F	howere i have a friend who had a good experience , every cloud !
F	i recommend shoetique to friends and clients ( i work in a physio clinic and love fitflops ), in fact recommended them to a lady today .
F	frustrating , delivery went_astray , second delivery arrived , box broken and wet !
F	all purchases so far have been of good quality and value for money .
F	super_fast delivery , upgraded for free .
F	the price was very good too .
F	have used them 0 times_now , and never been disappointed .
F	this was in the alloted_time_slot .
F	till min stora glädje så fick min_mor sina blommor på sin födelsedag och buketten var fantastisk .
M	they are all of the above , they stand out for their quality and design .
M	this vacuum_cleaner makes the dyson look and feel agricultural .
M	have been with vodafone for years , never bothered changing .
M	terms and conditions which aren_'_t confusing , and everything they committed to on their web_site they done .
F	mrs wilson .
M	really good . easy to use . quick and reliable . defo going to use again
F	good web_site , excellent service and delivery - you have one very happy customer !
M	waitrose customer sales and support
F	i ordered one pair of shoes and they were delivered within_00hrs with free delivery !
F	they are not cheap but the quality is reliable so worth the investment .
M	made an order with standard delivery between 0 - 0 business days on monday .
F	i met the recipient at her 00th_birthday_party last night and was told she had not received my flowers .
M	also for my last purchase i missed an item off my order .
F	excellent service all together .
F	i told them i would not be using the company again but the customer_services rep didn_'_t seem too bothered
M	all i want is an ipad which surely should not be too difficult for this " multi - million company " to provide !
F	i don_'_t often return things as sizing is generally spot_on with their own branded clothing and the brands they supply , but when i have had to return it has_been free and the refund is actioned really quickly .
M	will always use this company when required .
M	great prices if you wait for a sale , but the quality of their gear varies wildly .
M	this is the only musical_instrument company i will use now , they ' re that good .
M	over the following 0_weeks the item still showed as in stock and the price was lowered by £_00 .
M	tomany errors
F	we try and avoid them from now on .
M	great cash_back offers and when there has_been a long payment from its partners quidco sorts out the problem fast !
F	would never recommend them to anyone !!
F	i ordered a perfume during the first week of december , giving me plenty of time for the last christmas order date of the 00th .
F	i ordered duvets , covers and pillows from this company via_amazon .
M	personally i was surprised that a company that behaves like this was able to establish a 0 *_rating - my experience certainly wouldn_'_t indicate as such .
F	however , as soon as i clicked on the link , the 00_%_discount previously offered was gone and instead a free delivery was automatically_applied .
F	collection was booked for after 0pm thurs yesterday , they arrived before that time a card was left .
M	om_een lang verhaal kort te maken , niet alleen de vakantie op_de locatie dient leuk te_zijn maar ook het voortraject in dit geval de boeking dient leuk te_zijn .
F	please confirm if you are actually selling tickets or if i brought a potential resale which might not materialise .
M	when i have another phone to sell i will use them .
F	great value for money , but a few things did let us down .
M	in the branch called me " boss .
F	the lilies that were open were all brown and papery , the buds that were not open were wrinkled , brown spotted and were obviously going to open brown if they opened at all .
M	i have had no delivery problems and the meat is always chilled when it arrives .
M	as a long_standing customer i feel it is important to have continuity of " lines "
F	just rubbish service .
F	nb_: if you instal it by yourself , do not forget to remove the security bolts behind the wasmachine or you could damage it .
F	it is impossible to get through on the phone , it just goes to a recorded_message , and they don_'_t answer email .
M	i was told this wasnt possible , i stated the person is going on holiday and wont be in !!
F	a neighbour had seen the delivery van and watched the person just dump the parcel outside my friends door so went and took them in for her and left her note , i had a text saying they had been left_securely at the front_door , i don_'_t call just being propped against front_door securely !!!
F	i bought . the wonder_woman child '_s outfit . on arrival i thought what a great item but on closer_inspection i ended_up repairing seems that were not sewn . the outfit was for a 0 - 00 child but my daughter is 00 and it was massive so i would say go very small with the options . i think the item is overpriced for what it is .
M	after agreement was made - that '_s where all problems started : the agreed charge was triple ( they started to divide the agreed charge by a few different accounts and merchants and tried to explain that these are all different things which were extra charged - this was never explained .
M	can '_t beat the service
F	hi , although i have only good comments regarding the quality of the hire care i would have liked to have had an itemised bill at the end of the hire .
F	very helpful and friendly team .
M	the transaction was smooth - from the initial order via the website to the delivery , which arrived as promised .
M	dreadful service .
F	ordered 0 diarys from jessops and had to pick photos to put in them - got the item but not sure its what i thought it would be the photos are just paper and thought they would be stronger than that
F	superb hat , delivered promptly - exceeding the delivery estimate .
F	the flowers finally arrived past 0pm and we stayed in all day waiting for them .
F	the flowers were beautiful but the head of the biggest flower had broken off inside the delivery box which was disappointing as they were a gift
M	don_'_t get_stung by the website claiming " receive no - obligation trade quotes on cheap car parts within minutes via_email , text or telephone absolutely free " because as soon as you reply their premium phone line cash registers are ringing up the profits !
M	i bought the xl protein and straight_away was taken_aback at the dampish appearance in texture of it .
F	i assumed for that price of £_00 ( incl delivery ) the lid for the drawer was included .
F	combine that with the ability to set a price range and filter out low - rated places we found the perfect place for us quickly .
M	find click pay and it comes straight to your front_door no waiting at till or for a silly sales_assistant who_knows nothing about everything .
M	that aside however a pretty good service .
M	well that was the conclusion i came to after 0 months of trying .
M	why pay more ?
F	i emailed them about this straight_away and they told me they couldn_'_t give me another pair as they were now out of stock ( nightmare 0_weeks before christmas !).
F	delivery super_fast .
M	i ended_up having to purchase half the products elsewhere which defeated the object of ordering in the first place !
M	chemist_direct need to review their ordering_process on line to ensure this does not happen again .
F	my husband bought me a beautiful_bouquet . 00 days ago they are still fresh
M	the web_site does not say " we might be able to deliver if we can find someone_who isn_'_t closing " it says order before 0pm and we will deliver same day .
F	no problem with argus_car_hire but fire fly car_hire in malaga we ' re not very good .
F	i have cleared my cookies etc .
M	well_designed website with good filters / searching .
M	on checking with a depth gauge , i realised that it would be due for replacement soon .
F	frustrated , i thought i '_d phone them .
F	booked a photography_course , e_- mailed the company and left messages on their mobile , ałl of which was ignored .
M	charged extra for immediate delivery which failed , ordered standard spec but told i ordered custom fit if that was the case only needed reading and they would have noticed it was a standard club which they had in stock so wasted 0 days .
F	and the books arrive shortly_after being ordered .
M	remember to protect_your goods use protect_your bubble cause they give you good cover for a very good price any where around the world
F	i even looked up theatre trips but there are only a few shows and not really anything that is any good .
F	i ordered a basket and money was taken from my account on 00th_july_0000 .
F	i find preloved easy to use , with a nice format .
F	this got annoying when i was happy with how i had arranged the images and it shuffled them around again .
M	the delivery man was excellent , he helped unpack and install it .
M	when i received the balls , this logo was not on any of the boxes an it looks_like i have received the old version .
F	uch bad lush .
M	the first time i have used eflorist .
M	i was after a ps0 for xmas so my elderley mum said she would buy me a game for it .
M	i ' d be happy to have paid a few more pounds to get better quality fixings .
F	this company took my money , but never sent my order .
F	no response .
M	cannot_believe i wasted £_000 on these_guys .
M	but same time charing 00 gbp for installation of the line i already have !!!
M	wouldn_'_t recommend using these under any circumstances .
M	the sort of service we should expect but , unfortunately , don_'_t get from a lot of suppliers .
F	i rang and was advised there still was no stock and did i want to cancel .
F	why can '_t i have it in english , search in english etc .
F	i was disappointed though with the service when placing my order .
F	fortunately a friend forwarded them to me and when they arrived , all 0 letters inside had the correct_address .
M	simply for my tv to work - for me to get the service i have been paying for and not receiving for the past 0 months !
F	on friday_afternoon however i got an_email from see tickets saying that due to production change my seats have been reallocated to block 0 row n which is quite high up .
M	the camera arrived the following_day but no card was sent .
M	to make_matters_worse there was no apology , my conclusion was that this companies sales advisers cannot be trusted , so i decided not to pursue my interest further and told the manager to delete my
F	upon further_discussion he agreed to phone my local kwik_fit ( which i would to drive too !)
M	obviously been very concerned i contacted groupon , i was told the vouchers had now expired so i would not be getting a refund .
F	but i thought you should know that there ought to be a double layer of packing at the bottom of the box to prevent this sort of thing happening .
M	it '_s the first time i have used this company , but it won_'_t be the last .
F	the lady at the clinic in cork said it will need to be redone , but they now have a better surgeon in cork and i won_'_t be in as much pain as he is better_than the guy in kildare .
M	i ' d identified a specific grohe basin_mixer required in a bathroom remodelling project .
F	i would certainly recomend ,
M	when i rang up they offered me another jacket with a different brand which i did not want so they offered me a refund but only when they collected the woman '_s jacket .
F	great website ; easy to use even for me !!!
M	a great service from offtek .
F	in the past l have not received any discount .
M	look at all the other reviews for city_link , what a terrible company record , so bad i suspect the only good reviews are from their employees paid to do so .
F	i ordered on the 0st_november_0000 and my parcel came on the 0th_nov , the box was damaged with a big hole in it and the gravel bag that was in it had burst_open and half the gravel was missing and it had poured all over into the courier car !
M	the av0tor kneepad , however , is a different_story .
M	the usual loads of options followed_by endless minutes of waiting .
M	receiving the wrong item was an inconvenience - the north_face bags clearly have what size they are on the side , so there was no excuse .
M	packing in a box would be better as these are supposedly more_expensive items of clothing .
M	quality appears to be good and fitted_perfectly communication was excellent and kept in touch throughout the order process .
M	i was very impressed with the way gemma_mcdermott dealt_with my pension she kept me informed every_step of the way
M	een wat een selectie !!
F	he took my number and also relayed it back to me to make_sure it was correct .
F	great company to deal with , grandson is 00years of age and we had difficulty in finding him a jersey to go mountain biking this company came up_trumps would certainly use again and no_hesitation in recommending this firm keep_up the excellent work .
F	daft but life is made up of small things !
F	serenata - you should be ashamed .
M	we received top quality treatment all the way through our_honeymoon .
F	however , since last years ' order the adult moccis ' prize has doubled (!!!).
F	would like someone to contact me urgently as i have never received my delivery yet the money was taken over a week_ago and have had no correspondance as to a delay !!!
M	my experience was fine .
F	just waiting for someone to phone then visit now .
F	great experience all_round !
F	i ordered the roses and stocks bouquet for my mother in laws_00th_birthday , online the roses looked pale_pink and the stocks an assortment of purples .
M	i placed my order and after i had sent the order i realised i had ordered the wrong_size tees ( there was a lot of them - 000 ).
M	whilst the steaks looked very lean , and tasted fine , they were both tough in terms of texture .
M	i have bought several items from superdry , and the choice and quality has_been good .
M	i was kept up to date with emails_telling_me the status of my order .
M	the trader i bought from has_been informed of this failure and is very unhappy .
F	optimax also didn_'_t tell me i had a lazy eye which is bad because the risks are higher when having_laser_eye_surgery with a lazy eye .
F	not being_able to physically buy a pram on a sunday due to warehouse being shut was frustrating , we also requested a call when our required model would be in which never happened .
F	i spent extra to get a larger bunch of flowers and although the box was massive , the flowers were not .
F	i know i left it to last_minute but expect the order to be picked correctly .
F	i used interparcel for the first time , as i had read online that most people were happy with them .
M	good interest_rates but it '_s slow investing and not many new investments .
M	clearly the company prefers not to take returns and makes doing so very difficult .
F	house_network were so easy to deal with from beginning to end .
M	i have bought other tools etc from tooled_up . com and they have consistently given really good service and are very competitative on price .
F	long_stay parking at_stansted is fairly reasonable for the price although booking way in_advance secures the best cost .
M	hope it '_s as tough as stated if i ever drop my phone , only time will tell .
F	it '_s great that the website has a search_function that allows you to eliminate certain ingredients , such as pork ; not so great when you can '_t trust it , and you end up with food you can '_t eat .
M	so presumably i now have to claim on my insurance and get it replaced ?
M	hence overall 0_stars .
F	i ordered some diamond white cider for my darling dad , as its impossible to get around where i live . i must_admit i was a bit " iffy " about buying an item such as this over the internet . there really was no need for me to worry , i placed the order late friday_afternoon and recieved my order from the drinkshop at 00am on monday_morning . the service i recieved from the drinkshop was better_than fabulous and i will_definatley be using them again , and will recommend them to everyone i know . please do not_hesitate to use the drinkshop . com
F	my last delivery i have had to cancel .
F	quick to order easy to track to find where & when your order will be delivered
M	needed to push my company , and wanted my van to do some advertising .
F	outfit arrived on time and as_described who could ask for more ?
F	we had to adapt it with cardboard and tape .
M	now i just buy refills .
M	robert e
F	delivery was fast and i have an extremely happy not to mention gorgeous smelling daughter !
F	today again another letter , my husband phoned back and they tried changing the terms and conditions , they said that the terms and conditions have changed since we signed the contract .
F	although i had no_problems with both my orders , i would have liked to have am email_confirmation when my order was received and another when it was dispatched .
F	simple - i will not be using serenata again .
F	everyone loves superdry , but .
F	i contacted mfd again and expressed my frustration at this and pointed_out that neither mfd or argos had informed me at any stage that the item had to be returned via argos and that another round_trip journey would cost more than the item i was returning .
F	cannot_fault the service i received from this company .
M	terrible customer service .
M	good quality record sent out quickly and packaged great .
M	it did come off with cleaning though .
F	very straight_forward website to use .
M	and for the price , you can '_t go_wrong .
F	i wouldn_'_t recommend using this website as you ' re not guaranteed to get what you ordered .
F	i figure , maybe i '_ll get it on the 00th , you know - because of the holidays , and they have a few more nice items i like , let_me get those .
F	i double_checked the refund policy on a base_layer top and it was agreed that i could return the item to a millets store , so i purchased 0 sizes online .
M	howeven none in stock .
M	shocking delivery especially as i paid £ 0 . 00 for the privilege , it was supposed to be with me in 0 days .
M	from my initial_contact with away0 , through to a successful booking , daniel mednick '_s delivery and approach has_been friendly , committed and diligent .
F	i have to say that i am very satisfied with your products and the way you are treating the costumers .
M	however , after making my purchase i did not receive any communication from this site .
F	they where a cheap tatty bunch that i could of bought from tesco '_s for £ 0 .
F	would not recommend to others .
F	have had more straightforward hiring experiences , but given the convenience of hiring in dieppe and driving a rhd car in france , i would hire from europcar again only be more careful about making_sure i got a car more suitable to my needs and make a memorable point of handing_over the keys .
M	when i turned to the store manager for an explanation his answer was " well it is from our budget range what do you expect " this left me not only furious but also in an awkward_position as i had already installed the bath and toilet , i could not wait another 0_weeks for another replacement so i was effectively forced to keep my old sink .
F	sent flowers to my daughter who is a florist .
M	their hardware is okay , far from the best out there , but does the job . until some hidden self - destruct mechanism goes off after a predetermined time ( that '_s my belief anyway ).
F	i wish i had gone to boots or something where you can get 0 real quality designer_glasses for £_00 , ones that will last a couple of years .
F	i requested two balloons to accompany my order .
M	because of onsite complications had to return product , money was refunded immediately , very good service would use this company again .
F	but it '_s unlikely to be what your expecting !
F	beautiful flowers , was kept up to date with texts .
F	i purchased the plum pixie fairy costume which was unfortunately not as pictured .
F	my husband couldnt understand what they sent us either .
F	very pleased with all my purchases all working well , no hassell . this just so important .
M	no sleep most nights if you are a normal sleeper or have kids .
F	i arranged for insurance to be faxed directly to burnley so vehicle could be taxed .
M	gave_me an additional discount for a bulk buy
F	i '_m not impressed with peninsula , and so was interested when i received via_email from manchester confidential , an_email that said i could have " free employment law advice for employers based on the acas code of practice .
F	transaction_id_0000000
M	.
F	i will definitely check out cheapsmells first next time .
F	i did say " which your company employs " but got no joy .
M	they are let_down by careless home delivery staff who clog the aisles with large trolleys chatting and poor responses to comments .
M	the guy on the enquiries counter found the item in the warehouse and yet again it had been smashed beyond use .
F	took them 0_days to inform_me they would pick_up in three more weeks and also that the refund i requested have to ll this trouble would not be refunded until drawers picked_up and then i would have to wait another 00 working_days after that . not yet refunded as these are due for pick_up this week .
F	regards
M	i think this company is basically sound but when you hand over several_hundred_pounds it does make you sweat a little when you cannot get hold of a human_being , customer service needs some working on and then they would be a great little company and no doubt pick_up far more business !
F	ich_bin über einen groupon deal auf diese seite gekommen .
F	they were sent for a birthday and the recipient was delighted with them .
M	i '_m a former computer support engineer , so i know that it '_s not a fault at my end .
M	i felt as though the offer should not be advertised if the system is not working .
F	no_hassle ordering and next_day delivery what more could you ask
M	very dodgy
M	sorry rentalcars - when you screw up ( as you undeniably did on this one ), take_responsibility .
F	in the first_instance i was led to believe i was getting £_000 for my iphone 0 , which was not that old a phone .
M	the items were in my basket whilst i was going back and forth with the store and my card issuers to try and identify the problem . which of course was their website , but they at first denied this .
F	there is no e_mail address for this company which is ridiculous given that they supply internet services and expect me to use the online service to order from them !!
M	great quality retro kit - all received within a day of ordering .
M	i called up twice to get the system up an running and spycameracctv were absolutely fantastic .
M	my reservations are due to the clunkiness of the user experience ; if i didn_'_t know exactly_what i was shopping for i am sure it would be worse .
F	must be the best service you can get !
M	rest is good .
M	items arrived very swiftly and in excellent packaging .
M	i am someone_who_buys lots of outdoor_clothing / equipment and have recently had the pleasure of purchasing products from the outdoor + country store .
M	i spent £_00 on a valentines package for my wife .
F	it was a good , fast booking in , and even moved onto earlier time as they were running_late , due to bad_weather .
F	would like to half game site , so i can do other things while i play .
M	after waiting in a full two_days for item to be collected i cancelled and got my money back .
F	please , please do not book with hotelsclick - i have never come_across a company like this that takes your money yet does not pick_up the phone or reply to emails .
M	i did however get a phone_call at 0 . 00 am on the sunday after the delivery date from the driver saying he was half an_hour away .
M	great service and buy all my clothes / shoes / equipment here !
M	ian ranger godalming & villages lions club
M	now as fuerteventura is such a small island you would need to drive 000km per day to stand a chance of using it all !
F	i was then sent an incorrect form to complete , when i did get the correct form and submitted it there were some bits of evidence needed that were missing but the forms had not been checked with the excuse " staff are not trained in that particular form ".
M	i was amused to notice , in my emailed confirmation , that a suit was being made for a man 0 cm tall weighing 000 kilos !
F	would not_hesitate to use again or recommend .
F	very impressed .
M	great service from the delivery team , amazing value product .
F	delivery finally took place over a week after it had been scheduled .
F	its an appaulling service to start with , and the after care and customer service is even worse !
M	so_far i have placed an order and made payment , i think i have done well so_far .
M	you are also kept well informed and there has never been any delay .
F	start to finish was very simple , i liked how i could track progress of my order at anytime .
M	honestly don_'_t bother , if you like watching movies from this decade or the last , get something like netflix , they actually have stuff worth watching .
M	they had to set it all up again .
F	there are so many hostels , hotels , b_& bs , etc .
M	one of the great things is delivery to outlying spots that normal couriers won_'_t touch or that will charge a lot for , like the highlands .
M	even if by chance one of your shirts are ready & you happen to have purchased 0 , they will wait_until the other is ready before delivery , coincidently around the 0 week mark .
M	i can '_t speak more highly of them .
F	she now has centre stage in the front_garden and is settling well .
M	chose kitchen_appliance centre because of good reviews on this and other forums .
M	one for a three year contract and one for a pay as you go .
F	enough said !
F	call neverland because that is where they are base .
F	delivery was not with the stated courier , so we had to travel 00 miles each way to collect our parcel .
F	!
F	oh , and as they have changed me to a super_duper money saving tariff ( pfftt ) i '_m now , stuck with them !
F	excellent service goods arrived promptly .
M	i have used glasses_direct a few_times and never been dissapointed .
F	was very pleased as the first item was broken another one sent no_quibbles & didnt have to mess around sending it back . would use again
F	it has given this lady so much pleasure -- now her friends want some
M	apart_from this ( although minor takes time and effort to fix at the time ) i was pleased with the service .
M	all in all , rubbish !
M	it has to be said , the brand itself is pretty_cool , but what good is a catchy brand_name when the service ' delivered ' or in this case not , is nothing but appalling .
F	the only person i was ever able to speak to was a girl who clearly had no authority to do anything but was well practised in the broken record technique & dealing_with difficult situations - she continually put me on hold to refer to someone_else in the office but refused point_blank to allow me to speak to anyone_else even_though someone was clearly there .
M	delivery was quick .
M	what is the point in using a courier if i can '_t track ?
F	going out waited half hour , was not happy as they kept saying be there in 0 min why say that should of said be a while .
M	the hut is a great site for dvd '_s and music etc but their clothing range is poor quality .
F	prompt delivery and much_cheaper with better offers than other_sites .
F	fantastic service and amazing products .
M	amazing quickly response from tom on email ( especially as it was a bank_holiday ), really helpful and when i asked_him to match the offer from gak it was great that he was empowered to do this .
F	first time using blue_chip holidays , i '_m_sure it wont_be the last .
M	they set themselves a low standard and fail to achieve it .
F	website is not always working correctly , i thought i had placed an order , only to discover it had not gone_through , waited a week and sent an_email to customer_services and did not ever receive a reply ,
F	they are still showing the same costume as available on their website and i have had no contact from them telling_me that there is a delay .
F	the telephone_numbers to call on return , so you can have vehicle delivered to the airport are not answered .
M	i provided authorisation to charge the shipping cost but feel that they were very unprofessional in charging the spare_part and giving the impression that this was the only cosy , only to refuse to ship the part unless an additional payment was made .
M	i '_m_sure they didn_'_t do it deliberately and i would order from them again but they ' d have to package things a little better
F	they then told me that they would not refund me !!
F	ordering was easy , delivery great .
M	!
F	next time i would order by phone and not online as online it showed stock was available when it wasn_'_t .
F	i called again and got the same person .
M	0 ) good quality product 0 / 00
F	did exactly as they said on the web_site for a reasonable_price .
F	upon collection the next_day they box was all torn and bashed .
M	their product does not work well .
M	v quick delivery
F	very rude !!
M	yes , other web shops are cheaper for the product , but they add postage to push the overall price up .
M	products arrived a few_days after ordering .
F	i therefore paid £_00 . 00 for the privilege of dealing_with ebookers !
F	so they took my money and the goods .
M	i found this service through an internet_search and having read the reviews , i plumped for them .
M	the car we were given was not as ordered and despite budget '_s protests , it was from a larger , and to us unsatisfactory , category .
M	i highly_recommend modelrailwayloft .
M	funny_thing is , all i received was the two items of which there were two of each which were sent by royal_mail in an envelope .
M	you wont be disappointed and you will use them again

M	this is not about a call_centre being in india , there are many companies with great call_centres abroad in india and other_countries . this is about a call_centre with staff who don_'_t care , maybe don_'_t have the right training , maybe are not set any targets or are not monitored or just don_'_t get feedback about their poor performance .

F	this company i '_d quick enough at taking your money but runs it on a shoe string where engineers are concerned .

F	they don_'_t have everything but if they '_ve got what you are looking for i bet it will be cheaper .
M	finding the pick_up location was also not difficult .
F	there are a lot of signs for other car_parks , could be confusing .

M	after my post on trustpilot i received a phone_call from emilie who_apologised for the inconvenience and said that she would apply for my refund and process as quickly as possible but it could take up to 00 working_days , so my first thought was , i won_'_t hold my breath , we will wait and see and planned to count the days down .
F	will definitely be using them again !
F	therefore i had to contact them over and over again , and this caused my package to be delayed by about a week from it arrived in bangkok until i recieved it on the island i '_m staying at , simply because they only gave half informations of procedures , and after days where nothing had happened , i would have to contact them again and again .
F	eventually got everything about 0_days after original order .

F	beautiful and expertly arranged .
F	basically dial a flight use another company to make the accommodation bookings .
M	i was very impressed with petmeds service , and the product ordered was first_rate .
M	i really do not think value basket will ever learn and predict their constant bad_reviews will eventually put them out of business .
F	the item arrived promptly with no superfluous packaging
F	the company was easy to deal with and my furniture was fantastic , delivery much sooner_than the estimated 00 working_days , only worry at first for me was when i called the phone was answered with just a " hello ", so it made me worry that they were not a genuine company but i worried unnecessarily as all was fine .
F	has persuaded me that i should cook portions for myself and freeze them , then i will have the system with food i want to eat
F	not worth the £_00 they cost or the postage money .
M	first time i have ever felt the need to review a company - i ordered at 00 : 00 on friday so just missed the cut_off for next_day delievery ( which as i paid £_00 . 00 for my bracket im not to worried_about next_day ) bracket arrived in perfect order and fits my tv perfectly .
F	just totally delighted with the photobook i ordered .
F	great product but customer service really needs looking at .
M	i have given 0_star merely because i do not appreciate being deceived and not notified or informed that items are shipped from overseas .
F	after_spending almost £_000 over the past 0_months i '_m moving onto a different supplier !
M	the website is user_friendly and delivery was really quick , i cant_fault it .
M	0_weeks_later without compensation , they then sent the item back , and demanded i sent images of the damage !
M	i '_ve bought their ts000 - p wireless lapel and headband microphone kit .

F	brilliant prices , fabulous customer service !
F	i was so pleased with my book that i wanted to buy a voucher as a gift for someone_else .

F	i tries ringing them for two_days in a row and spent a small_fortune but no one ever answered i was on hold forever .
M	then the out of stock email , 0 month delay , now another email 0 month delay !
F	well_done oakfurnitureland !!
F	finally customer service : talk about not what they claim .
M	i will try the service once more and if i see this type of behaviour again , i won_'_t continue .
M	i ordered sonnet tempo pro sata express card and echo pro thunderbolt adaptor both were well priced .
M	the air_conditioning needed topping_up .
M	also , their shipping_costs are outrageous .
M	my father is an honorable man whose level of integrity has required me to send his details to the company so that they might be matched to the cheque already dispatched and so that smartparking will not upset him further .
F	presumably that is why they insult the caller by endlessly repeating the same - incorrect message at them .
M	i also emailed to ask if there was anything we could do to make me feel better as i had more gear to order , ie small goodwill discount but i did not get a reply either .
F	if they '_d been more accurate when i first called , or he '_d called to update me at any point , i could have popped out before he arrived .
F	i ordered the gorgeous blue orchid bunch , only i got a text around 0am saying that theyd been loaded_onto the van and were on route . i waited around all day and didn_'_t receive them until after 0pm . but hey what do you expect for free delivery . when they arrived they they were not only a disappointingly small bunch compared to the picture of them on the internet but many of the delicate leaves were scorched and shrivelled from the heat in the van .
F	i don_'_t usually shop on line - not sure why - but probably a bit_nervous of giving my credit_card_details and hearing of some people '_s bad_experiences with regard to wrong description / bad quality / poor service etc .
F	the items arrived in good time and at a very good price - with free delivery thrown in .
F	it is quite a popular hostel and the other_travellers were very friendly and talkative - good atmosphere .
F	my old_faithful 00 year_old sebo_hoover packed in thru me sucking up water i never saw on the floor .
F	bought a large order for a new_bathroom , which was delivered as promised and the quality is fantastic .
M	if supplementwarehouse lowers its shipping rates , i would buy everything here .
M	is what i found to the best part of the agreeemnt , unlike an airline , is that , and at no extra_cost , was the chance to board an earlier later crossing .
M	very simple and convenient .
F	?
M	without grammar lessons , as it stands busuu isn_'_t comprehensive enough to actually learn a language from using it alone .
F	i would definitely use these again as there is a wide_variety of wormers that are much_cheaper_than the saddlery and delivered quickly .
F	what a shame when it was to congratulate my daughter and her husband on the birth of their son .
F	before i knew it my pack had arrived and in perfect_timing for my birthday trek in knoydart .
M	the following_monday i phone shopto in the morning and am told that they are waiting for dpd to confirm that the parcel is indeed missing and they will get me a replacement out that same day .
M	order placed , good comms throughout and fast free delivery
F	it was also the first order that i placed - on 0 december and only after chasing my order did i receive an_email_saying that it was ' despatched ' on 00 december !
M	i feel as if we regular_users are being milked .
M	thank_you .
M	merry_christmas .
M	it may be more_expensive but fuck it , we get what we pay for .
F	asos , it '_s disgusting that you can promote such incompetent idiots to ' senior ' positions who clearly have no understanding about buying and selling regulations within the uk and who refuse to protect their customers when all they have done is purchase in good faith and have used their legal rights when they have received unfit items . the whole episode has cost a lot of time , money and effort and with my wedding day approaching , has only made matters worse with me having to find an_alternative dress in a very short_space of time .
M	i bought weights for the integrated pockets at the same time and the overall delivery charge was minimal .
M	only got part refund when i threaten to report them to my bank .
F	therefore , making early settlement impractical and very expensive .
M	i have even found it is cheaper to order from over_seas , pay drastic shipping and even pay custom fees and yet it is still cheaper !
M	i put my trust in the website marketing claims but it seems i should have shopped_around more .
F	at 0 : 00 there was no sign , so i called the adband office back , and everyone had left .
F	i could not fault it and have since order two more .
F	i would recommend petmeds to anyone .
M	simply dreadful service , sent me an imei blocked mobile , then after having me running around to ee then agreed it was their problem and took the phone back , after advising me to send the phone back to them with my original sim_card , they sent me a replacement phone out without a sim !!
F	i booked a cleaner for the 0th_april as i was on leave and hoped to get a one - off clean done .

M	have used musikding 0 times now , and each order has got from germany to england in under a week , well_packed and with email_updates !
F	they don_'_t tell you that what you see as charges are for a ' pre_- order ' and when they finally get around to telling you what it will cost , and it shows for t - mobile £_00 . 00 - but when several days_later ( major delay ) they come_back they want another payment of £_00 !
M	even_though this was a low value order it was still dispatched very quickly , was well_packed and free delivery . highly_recommended . a ++++++
M	management who instruct their staff to deal with complaints like this are not only abusing people but they are also costing the company a lot of money in the long run .
F	website easy to use and goods were delivered the following_day
F	otherwise , happy with the quick and good service .
M	regards : p
F	very reasonably_priced and quick to deliver .
M	mazuma sent me a prepaid_envelope to return the phone in , so all i had to do was pack everything back in the box ( always wise to save the original_packaging ) and post the box .
F	inform you all the time our order despatch and delivery etc .
F	plus they were on special_offer !
F	marina

M	will order from them in future but lesson_learnt :)
F	although the frames and lenses were sent back within about 0_weeks , the vision on one side was blurry and i couldn_'_t use them .

M	only issue here is the communication when the item was out of stock and my account was debited !?!?!?
M	i guess its my fault should of asked if it was clear vinyl .
M	i just did not get out of it what i wanted - great 00 / 00 vision .
F	i will still use you again and recommend you to family and friends , but on this occasion i felt very let_down .
M	couldn_'_t ask for more .
F	i have always been impressed by simply_supplements , they have a very quick delivery response , i have been using them for years and i will_continue to use them for all my orders .
F	lesson_learned if there is no shop to an online business avoid !!

M	we waited and waited for the microsoft search_engine to fnd anything similar to what you wanted .
F	when i phoned , thinking they would simply send a new disk i was told that it was impossible for the disk to be missing but that they would check and get back to me .
F	it was a mess and handled badly .
F	the internet site was a nightmare and i couldn_'_t order 0 thing the same , but to be sent to different addressed .
F	their treatment is despicable , even by the director .
F	a bit like expecting a sparkling firework and getting a damp squib .
M	everything from dispatch through to delivery at address .
M	the 0 items i ordered from elc all arrived on time and as i ' d no clear timeline for this item i went_ahead and built the climbing_frame for my son '_s birthday and then subsequently had to dismantle the ladder to fit this cover only a day later .
F	awful customer service .
F	this is the second time i have used seranta even the first time was bad but i thought i would try again but i will not use them ever again .

M	0 week delay , a match lost a 0 phone_calls took to actually get the racket .
M	order cancelled on site record
F	well_worth avoiding .
M	would definately recommend to others .

M	when you buy a new item of furniture you do not expect holes to be filled in on the solid_wood .

F	ordered a barbour_coat on tuesday night and it was delivered first thing on thursday_morning .
M	they do really treat you like a vip and i was incredibly impressed by how this was handled .
M	so what was the point of asking !
F	website is easy to use .
F	i would use this service again .
M	should have bought first from here .
F	i have bought several prams from this shop and each time ive been astounded by price , reviews , offers including their own promotional_codes they do and quick delivery .
M	crap company and even crapier service .
F	the outfit was just what i wanted and good quality , felt fab in it too
F	they post to other destinations but not cyprus .
M	upon returning to his car with his shopping , he discovered your company '_s chit and immediately attempted to find the attendant , without_success .
M	a few_days before i emailed in a query about one of my target tunes using the contact form on the web_page , but i never_heard back .

F	came_across a great company to supply some cycling_shorts on the internet , called cycle_clothing . co . uk .
F	the next_day i found out from my boss that the first call alone had cost us £_00 !!!

F	this resulted_in confusion and worry .

M	no explanation and no phone_call from rental_cars to explain_why .
M	tried to make a call last_week for an_emergency and the house holder said if you go into the loft you might get a connection .
M	as i now live out of the north_east and do not travel there as frequently i am disappointed how the service in my oponion for the online service appears to have gone down , my expectations of service and packaging i believe should be higher_than that of a high_street store .

M	mis a part ça je pense que woodbrass est_très sérieux tant au niveau qualité de matériel qu ' en conseils .

F	i went to the desk to enquire and eventually upgraded , i was told i would have to pay 00_euros extra as it costs more if done on board .
F	free_postage is a bonus .
F	although the costumes are good i do feel they are overpriced for what you get in them me and my partner spent a lot of money on 0 costumes and some of the descriptions do not fully include what you do and don_'_t get , considering my mum sent £_00 on her costume and it included more than what we got in a single costume on the website and we requested that they be signed for due to amount we spent but they never were they were just left on our porch , i don_'_t know that i would shop there again .

M	i am not happy at all with this service and have now left phones0u !
M	i ordered a bag from website that implied it was in stock .
M	card was poorly_written
F	what a shame the experience has left me very disappointed .

F	have now booked p ! nk tickets for manchester 00 / 00 / 00 and with 0_days to go it has happened again but this time they have not responded about replacement tickets .
F	i have to say i am hugely_impressed by the overall quality .
F	my money was taken without_any problem though !
M	very very quick payment and all_round good service .
F	there ´_s lots of choice , manny manny articles that can fit what your desire .
F	my only_criticism is that it took 0_days to arrive - so it was delivered after her_birthday .
M	delivery was a let_down though - 0 days to arrive and then only came_across it atback door by chance - no communication from delivery company .
M	i am not shocked , interparcel is really struggling at the moment .
F	what more can i say ?
M	clh .
M	am fitting booked .
F	unless somebody makes such a gesture , i won_'_t be using again .
F	useful site but the result cane through with the letter ssi and gsi on the list . what do these mean ?
F	but they need not to take money for items they do not hold in stock and have no idea when they will have in stock and they seriously need to learn customer service .
M	he replied " fair_enough "
F	the customer_services is rubbish because when i notified them they sent me a ' standard response ' email which indicates they had not read my email properly and it also indicates they are used to complaints .
F	used all the time handy tool
M	as far as e_- outdoor is concerned i found a comprhensive range of products at very competitive_prices .
F	very easy no complicated situations you get with ebay or other_sites when trying to sell your old_mobile phone .
M	i won_'_t give very the benefit of the doubt !
M	correct me if i am wrong , people generally would expect to get a bmw 0 series back if they send in a bmw 0 series for replacements , wouldn_'_t they ?
F	blind is useless abd ruined the look of the room - never again .
M	however i found the site easy to use .
F	don_'_t like having coin operated small trolleys while the big ones don_'_t need a coin .
M	v . happy with the service .
F	i requested and paid for a next_day service which was not honored and should have been refunded in full , even fed_ex thought i should but it had to be initiated from partyrama .
M	they wouldn_'_t budge so i was forced back into paying the dd on the date i didn_'_t want .
F	they sent my boyfs pair to the wrong_address , so generally not happy with the service as probably wasn_'_t even much_cheaper_than elsewhere
M	thought ordering was going to be difficult , but when i spoke to one of their team everything was made simple and fully_explained .
F	that bit was very disappointing as thought i had found a gem of a website .
F	they offer free delivery which with some companies can take a week to receive your goods but mine arrived a couple of days_later .
F	!
F	and then they still couldn_'_t promise it would be delivered the next_morning !
M	just consider that before you buy from this company .
F	partmaster was happy to refund but i would have the return postage deducted , making it the second £ 0 . 00 i had to pay out .
F	hi , i received the outfit reasonably quickly but when it arrived i noticed the dress had a hole on the seam .
F	were told delivery men would deliver to a named room .
M	the best bit is , that despite having a credit voucher , i apparently wouldnt be able to use that with a price match anyway !
M	still no compensation .
M	i have noticed links to mr_memory offering discount or promotion_codes .
M	also from an overall hotel aspect it lacked a nice area where guests could sit and relax , eg a nice lounge_area , rather_than just an extension on the reception_area .
F	jet0 needs to look at this very carefully and cease using gold car and any other provider who acts in this despicable manner .
M	really good and pay is fast :(
F	this site has lots of adverts and things jumping around , you can '_t spend too long on it but it does have some gems & good tips
F	completely_satisfied with the product and the service .
M	even sending a message to them results in a web error_message .
M	well it seems like a respectable company that has hit the big time has finally stopped being customer lead and the money machine firmly kicks in by not giving a damn about the customer .
M	delivery was prompt and i am_delighted with the products .
M	i have traveled with thomson three_times now , usually prefering to travel with kuoni .
F	( although probably not as much as before ) of the suet cake .
F	i have paid a lot of money to you .

F	online search lead me to animalmedic site , and as there price was the best i placed my order with them .
M	ordered several items from bathroom0u .
M	davpak do seem to try_harder than most , getting boxes available that fitted the new royal_mail sizing as soon as it was introduced was a smart move and one their competitors who we usually use didn_'_t respond to .
F	excellent service , easy to use website , delivery within couple of days even at this busy time .
F	really simple booking process .
M	jgibson .
M	after looking for an official_iphone_unlock company i have found them an i will be doing more unlocking with u guys very soon thanx

F	iconic_watches even asked me for his wrist sized so it fit_perfectly too and there was no need to take any of the links out !
F	!

M	you '_ve got a great business , don_'_t let it down with weak back - end service .

M	the product , which met my full requirements , was delivered within two_days .

F	quick reliable good product but not suitable for my machine .
F	caroline was very helpful , told me exactly_what would happen and put my fears to rest .

F	bought two lovely vegas bar_stools in april_0000 , one broke after just over one '_s year '_s use order number :_00000000 , after checking the website i realised that these were only guaranteed for 0 year only , this was very disappointing .
M	dot the is and cross the ts on the order detail .
F	rubbish quality - cheap is not the word .
M	is that honest ??
F	i was a bit puzzled as to why it would take so long for them to pick them up ( and a bit annoyed to have to store them for so long ) but customer_services were very helpful .

M	at this point i '_ve given up trying to return the item or get a refund .
M	thank - you kac !!
F	other relatives had flowers delivered to my mother in law from different florists , interflora and christines florists and the flowers from those distributors are blooming lovey !
M	good park and ride facility , except neither the bar_code scanner or payment card worked to enter or exit the car_park , meaning i had to press the help button to gain_entry .
M	however , for a 0 - 0 day build , it took 00 days for me to receive it , over twice the expected when you factor in shipping .
M	in desperation , we ordered a back up from viovet , which arrived , as promised , before 00pm the next_day .
M	i would recommend this to all my friends , easy , reliable and easy to contact .
F	our spare_tyre was on ( replacing the tyre that had been punctured ) and the " chauffeur " - i use this term loosely - had absolutely no idea about what had happened , although he had been driving the car with the spare_tyre on .
F	i couldn_'_t ask for a better service and i just wish i lived more local and had more money as i '_d be there all the time snapping up as many bargains as possible !
M	plus i also got spammed and can '_t remember signing_up for email and you can '_t unsubscribe .
F	anyway .
F	the product looks good too .
F	i buy all my perfume from all beauty . com because their prices are great and its very quick delivery .
M	everything arrived quickly and correctly as promised and good pricing too !
F	i '_m trying to get_hold of squires but will probably resort to getting it repaired locally .
F	the biggest problem i have is that it runs on a 0 week cycle rather_than monthly .
F	i have rarely come_across a more efficient , friendly , helpful company .
M	the enclosure itself looks the business .
M	this should have been included in the initial price .
M	price right , delivered next_day as promised
M	the price was competitive and there was a free leather wallet included in the deal , along with free delivery and a discount_code .
F	great service .
F	however the flower box was slightly_dented and three roses were damaged
F	very efficient to deal with , no_qualms about using them again in the future .
M	aldi may be very downmarket , but they are also very cheap .
F	it was very embarrassing and disappointing .
F	bargain carriage .
M	i found greenman_bushcraft after_googling .
F	in fact it was nothing like that at all the team have explained reassured and been very helpful .
M	all other laptops were the same or had heavy security weights on them .
M	the sun .
F	this is a sneaky marketing ploy to slip extra costs past the buyer and is a little underhand , especially when the cost is already premium .
M	ordered my playstation 0 a few week before official launch in uk , got mine on the release day and didn_'_t have to wait a month to get one , had no issues with contacting them when i needed help , they always contacted me and got to the point , no excuses that were given to me , they just replied very fast and was very happy with my order !

F	my returns experience was hassle - free , and i '_m pleased that i could return items free of charge , with no random fees deducted from my refund , and also that they send a confirmation of receipt of the return .
M	the carrier lost my parcel even_though i received an e_- mail saying it would be delivered .
F	unfortunately my case has_been lost and i am waiting to see if it can be found .
M	i phoned orange ( who employed dpd for some unknown_reason ) and they agreed to send my new iphone to my work address for monday and emailed their dpd contact to arrange the consignment .
M	shirt was delivered quickly as well , would highly_recommend this website to a friend .
M	i tried to re establish contact without_success and finally i gave up .
F	lesson_learned and will definitely not use them again .
F	the ending result is that you will never be used again as you can '_t be trusted to deliver .
M	customer service is obviously low on their company values .
M	chair is comfy / reclines / gas powered height_adjustment .
F	i asked for the phone back and was told i could not receive the phone back as the payment has already been sent !
F	my initial experience was very disappointing as my parcel took a long time to come and on arrival the product box was empty .
F	it must be boring / annoying for them to have to respond to questions that have answers in their faq .
M	personally i wouldnt waste money on an overpriced cable again .
M	i had these sent as a birthday_present for my mum .
M	otherwise first_class service - many_thanks
M	excellent service , bloody good prices and great products why would you go any where else .
M	we placed an order online for a shirt , which was shown with a tie , expecting delivery of a shirt and tie .
M	contact from them would have eliminated all of this
M	did the job but for a £_00 top up that should have cost £_00 , i had to pay a transaction charge of 00p .
M	if i had not chose to mow the lawn god_knows_how long it would have sat outside
F	so i phoned again asking if my money would be refunded in due course and they said i would recieve another email_confirming this only the pending money on my bank card wont_be added straight_away it will take up to 0_days if not longer .
M	once the second booking was created we carried on with the payment .
M	definately recommend .
F	sent wrong_size had to put in a space piece for them to fit as it would be to much_trouble to send back and wait again
F	sonia haddad
F	we ordered a big beanbag and after we ordered we changed our mind on the colour so we emailed the change and this was no problem the bag arrive when they said it would great service
M	happy with the product when it arrived but feel company abuses pricing by pricing trophies low but then overloading the postage_costs .
M	which i found on 00dover .
F	how can they get away with things like that .
F	easy to use web_site , super quick transaction for turning old_phones in to cash .
M	companies should bot advertise items until they are assured that they can actually deliver rather_than just comment " out of stock ", and then make their customer wait .
M	which i did and at 00 . 00 myukdelivery replied
F	nice professional website but do not be_fooled by the prices .
F	tried to buy a washer_dryer which would have been much_cheaper_than_anywhere_else i '_d seen it .
M	in both_cases i have chosen pet_supermarket .
F	i took the refund .
F	wonderful service , beautiful flowers and speedy delivery , just what i needed at the time .
M	they insisted on delivering tickets to our hotel in paris which they did .
M	and yes you are right , i could just refuse the order and this review would never happend .
M	everything that was requested was there and definitely worth the money .
M	so it was 0 days in total , rather_than the maximum of 0 stated on the website .
M	the explanation i received was different from the receptionists explanation and was as follows
M	thumbs_up for better service after a bad start .
M	they lost my luggage on a flight from the uk to brazil , and nobody tried to help , answered the phone or replied to my emails .
F	**********
M	absolutely_useless . no idea what they are doing . please don_'_t use them ever .
F	i have bought this champagne as a wedding gift and it didn_'_t disappoint .
M	they are not a florist and don_'_t understand the concept of sending flowers .
F	very annoying as i now have to mess around getting it shipped back to them .
F	they also have a great selection of top quality products .
F	ordered my worktops without_any_problems .
F	i ordered a pair of aigle clogs size 0 . 0 for my son and they arrived promptly .
M	i will buy a replacement rail from argos and avoid both very and yodel like plague .
M	today is the 00 . 00 . 0000 - i guess i will not be enjoying a cup of coffee any time soon !
M	end of .
F	quick and easy
M	seen there has_been a few different feedbacks about damaged goods , maybe they should change courier and make experience for customer better .
F	but there products were good that '_s the main_thing !
F	the service from diamonds_factory has_been excellent .
M	thankyou .
M	many_thanks
M	thank_you , best luck with the future .
M	astonishing !
M	i then rang customer_services and was promptly informed that i hadn_'_t paid for my product and this is why i hadn_'_t yet received it .
M	the fish and chips was soft and sloppy the curry was army style basically meat in gravy mix and the popodoms were actually hardly cooked so one side they were slighty risen with the other side hard and solid - straight out of the packet .
F	very good service
M	actually choosing the entire ring / diamond design ranges from easy to real easy .
F	:-/ [_name_] won_'_t let_me speak to anyone_else at bathshop about it .
F	lynn nicklin
F	they were delivered on time , and looked as good as the picture on the web - site , no disappointments on any front .
M	advice : plan for the good and bad_experiences with asda because as a whole the good is ok and the bad is an example of absolutely horrible customer service !
M	buying is easy and you get a quick confirmation via e_- mail .
M	they sent emails on delivery progress and the package arrived bang on time .
M	it is just the date of the next delivery to speed_graphic and they may not get enough stock to fulfill your order .
M	great will always order from this company items are dispatched the same day
M	as the bath was in an entire set with the panel for not much more than i paid for the bath . now i have a bath with no panel .
F	i spent a lot of time comparing_prices and delivery charges online - glad i went with net_curtains direct , i '_d happily use them again .
M	you will however receive plenty of threatening_letters and phone_calls demanding payment for inaccurate bills .
F	the items arrived promptly , were well_packaged and excellent value for money - will be using in future .
F	i loved that there is a box for being_able to type any delivery instructions because there is nothing_worse_than getting something mail ordered and then having to pick it up from te couriers depot because you weren_'_t in .
F	the nectar_card is great .
M	i always felt at ease , with proper professional advice on what would be the best treatment for me . the hospital in manchester has a comfortable waiting area , and my procedure was carried_out with the minimum of fuss . im very pleased with the outcome .
F	quick delivery .
F	thank_you alex will recommend to friends and family and will definitely order from you again .
M	the boxes themselves are made from very thin_cardboard and in my opinion should have had some added_protection before being sent in courier bags .
M	i '_ve been using this site for a few_years and they ' re always reliable .
F	also been told i wouldn_'_t receive another bike until the end of next week , its only monday now . but yet the original bike was sent next_day delivery .
M	i sent my mobile off on monday_morning , the money was in my account wednesday_afternoon !
F	as a school , we collected phones to raise money for a charity .
M	i certainly won_'_t leave it there .
M	order partially dispatched no email to let_me know .
F	the completed job looks great .
M	my issue really is that the website should have made it clear that the item was a special order and given me an eta for actual delivery as i would still have ordered it from them and arranged the fitting accordingly .
M	i asked the lady to redirect me over dunkirk
F	they often have offers , offer free delivery over a certain_amount , send the goods promptly and are very efficient .
M	then they blam ' supplier problems ' for the delay .
M	more so hearing dogs barking in the background was rather concerning and unprofessional and didnt speak like a solicitor !
F	i had the impression they are not at all interested in resolving an issue .
M	!
F	he took my husband ( who is good at diy ) and son nearly six hours to put_together .
F	only quibble is that i was told different things by different customer service advisors and their advice cost me money !
M	can '_t fault the service .
M	day one , was sent an email_stating delivery window of 0000 - 0000 .
F	good received as notified and am very happy with the items purchased .
F	i sent an_email to say i had not received an_email and did not get a reply so i sent another email after 00_hours ( which is the promised time for a response to an_email ).
M	april_00rd : i replied stating that i ' d like the item i ordered in the colour i wanted oringally .
M	the parts turned_up eventually , unfortunately they are the wrong parts .
M	why , if the delivery window is an_hour did i receive an email 00_minutes into the window stating failed delivery ?
F	!
F	will use this company again
F	screws in the legs would have made the whole_thing much_sturdier and i had known this i would have paid more for something that has solid legs .
F	this is the third time .
F	courier gave a 0hour delivery time .
F	when i complained they said they '_d had a price increase from their supplier which they hadn_'_t known about until i called .
F	mainly down to incorrect orders unfortunately . often the products are wrong , aren_'_t included , wrong sizes etc .
F	i waited a few_days and then emailed the uk support_team to find out how many more days it would take to rectify the issue .
M	she said no so i knew that they had not been delivered yet .
F	i bought my house in october_0000 and first_utility was already the supplier .
M	so it '_s possible we can promote the first0magnets if all goes well .
M	!
M	i wasn_'_t after a full_refund , rather a phone that i was happy with - so he '_s offered to take it back and redo it once they '_ve completed moving premises .
M	it went perfectly , even when we had decisions and changes to make .
F	rentalcars do not accept that anything was their fault and will not refund the difference_between the two car categories to me .
M	from one very happy customer !!
M	absolutely dreadful .
F	so the flippin hole was too_big to grip the shower pole , therefore useless .
M	prices are fair , i order a pair of cycling_bib and went by their sizing_chart but the fit was not accurate .
F	!
F	excellent service
F	trying to cancel my order requires a letter sent by registerd post .
F	i would recommend this to my friends
F	the recipient had just moved and obviously didn_'_t know any one to leave the flowers with , . i wanted to contact the company to ask them to leave them in a cupboard . i ended_up emailing but they didn_'_t get back to me . however it all turned_out okay in the end .
M	but no follow - up e_- mail from simply baby to explain the delivery would be delayed or apologising for late delivery ,
M	wren conveniently just apologised , sent me screws after the installation and then responded that we were not in the wrong and as a company we don_'_t offer compensation .
M	i thought i would use their price match_promise , quoting another sites product .
F	on the plus_side the member of staff that dealt_with my car was very quick , but things like cdw excess were automatically_added to the cost without even asking us .
M	so i said they could send the one product they did have .
M	after being referred by a colleague i decided to give this musclefood a go , i placed my first order and entered the ‘ hidden code ’ provided by my colleague , the offer was ; i would get 0 . 00kg of chicken_breast and he would get £ 0 off his next order .
F	thank_you
F	although i am pleased with the outcome , i feel that i am just a number in a production line and not a particularly valued_customer .
F	but all in all a good service .
F	but , i am a pensioner and the thought of losing over a £_000 was just too much , and i contacted procook who agreed to refund my money , i waited and waited , i didn_'_t get the three blocks either , and after over a week i rang them again and it was resolved_immediately .
F	prezzy can '_t write a review at moment .
M	great service , which is easy to use and easy to alter your choice
M	they had meant to call to advise me but the person responsible for making the call seemed to have forgotten and was away .
M	the picture were darker so it ruined quite a few of them .
F	the trophies were really good , the main won was the ' sensible ' one , but i think everybody would have like to have won the booby prize .
F	so pleased with these glasses and such a reasonable_price too .
F	that order wasn_'_t good value .
M	ok so i loved sky go when it came out and the recording aspect .
F	i also got in touch with trading_standards about miss advertising and ultimately with a couple more emails , i was fully refunded .
M	i agree with another_reviewer , watch for the auto - renewal , they love to capture your card_details and generate those invoices .
M	the company itself is excellent , stocking a wide_range of great value goods .
F	you have been warned .
F	it also stated on the receipt 00 x 00g but there were only 0 x 00g in the box which was a bit_disappointing .
M	by this time i was back at work and no_longer at home to recieve the package .
F	quick , simple and money for phones i was going to throw_away - many_thanks !
M	ordered two cat bowls in the shape of fish .
F	the following_morning , i phoned the office to ask them to put in a ' gift note ' and i was told it wasn_'_t possible .
M	when they do respond queries are usually resolved fairly quickly , but there have been a few occasions when it has taken a while to resolve an issue .
M	using the the offtek site i quickly found the ram i needed for the old pc i was upgrading .
M	i '_m only writing this review to save other pilots from making the same mistake .
M	excellent service and prices .
M	there was a scuff to the drivers_side wing_mirror which wasn_'_t noted on hand over and the car was infested with ants - not nice !
M	excellent service , great product , speedy and tracked delivery .
F	although fast delivery and i will wear my costume , it wasn_'_t worth the price .
M	after two_weeks we called the company and they said it was in germany and would arrive on 00 dec which is days ago .
M	the shirts are fantastic , the rest is just frustrating .
M	i had reservations_about using this service and expected to recieve less_than the advertised price .
M	also after talking to tony , i decided to increase the diamond to a vs0 and it was a great decision as the diamond is fantastic !
M	i found the price a little more_expensive than i have been paying buy i am happy to pay that extra for the good service that i have received .
F	please_avoid using arena flowers delivery at all costs .
M	excelleng website with great offers and really prompt delivery
F	scandalous company , advertising totally fictitious prices !
F	they have offered further help also ' any_problems call that is what we are hear for '
M	ordered a a boot_mat on 00th_november_0000 .
M	i am been trying to set_up drirect debt for for 0 years every time i try to set_up with them they say that you direct debt is not set_up and they charge you 0 pound for not having direct debt talktalk is so bad would book about how bad they are seriously
M	as a first time customer , not too impressed - regardless of how much i spent !!!
M	smooth_transaction would recommend :-)
F	i like the shaded map which shows the main tourist areas ensuring you do not end up in a dodgy area or miles_away from the sights you want to see .
F	was gutted that i couldn_'_t find it in stock anywhere at the time i bought the bikini .
F	clare '_s florist provide a great and trustworthy service .
F	i was searching online for a slate door number for my house and found atlantic_signs who are based in cornwall .
M	not good practice !
M	well surprise surpise it wasn_'_t !!
F	i wasn_'_t expecting perfect quality ( or even particularly good quality ), but both products i '_d ordered were awful .
F	fully_satisfied , no_complaints
F	only a refund will due now , both serenata and yodel are not doing all that is claimed on the website , totally_unacceptable .
F	monday i contacted them to see what time it would arrive and was told it would be delivered by highway couriers and they would phone me within 00_minutes with an_eta .
M	the pack arrived very quickly and the money arrived a couple of days after the handsets were posted along with a text_telling_me it had been sent .
M	put up note again , turned on outside lights and waited .
F	i could only get the product i needed from the doctor in 000g tubes but as i can use as much as i want when i want i was always running out and the prescription charge put me off using it all up .
F	but the fact that the plant was out of stock , and i received no notification until i chased the order was disappointing .
M	actually finding a buyer can take a while and need some luck , but it doesn_'_t require skill .
F	battery arrived in four days and is ok and does the job .
M	i have shopped with animed_direct previously , on both_occasions the product i ordered arrived .
M	due to items not being in stock , i '_ll have to place another order in future and pay for postage again , which is not favourable , but what can i do ?
F	i have ordered with this company previously and received the same excellent service !
M	this company should not be allowed to trade .
F	the engineer came out on the friday to install the line .
M	further , upon_contacting the store via_email - as suggested in confirmation emails from cashgenerator . co . uk - i have not had my issue solved .
F	my order was handled smoothly and quickly .
F	i recieved the boxes i ordered in perfect_condition , and got to work organising my work room , i am delighted with them .
F	no problem said the very pleasant check in staff ( they always are !).
M	also , they over - tax transations , with bouble fees when ebay
F	i would suggest that the photos of the chair on the website are updated to help buyers in the same situation .
M	a quality service .
F	after a couple of days i emailed to query the whereabouts of the item and they said " oh , they should have been delivered - we '_ll contact the couriers ".
M	nothing arrived .
M	nobody ever answers their phones .
F	it wasn_'_t even offered special delivery !
M	they were cheap and cheerful .
M	its wrong and wont be dealing_with them anymore
M	so now we have nothing to sit on thanks to complete incompetence from a shocking cowboy_outfit .
M	i would not_hesitate to recommend them to anybody !
M	we just found it a niggle that the free_postage was not automatically taken off .
M	ordered 0 t shirts with my own logo came on reasonable time but !
F	live_commentary on red_route good .
M	fast deliveries and excellent pricing .
F	i received the dog_food quickly and promptly as always .
M	fortunately the staff at the hotel were very good and got me another room with no extra_charge , but still we didn_'_t get our deluxe rooms as promised .
M	they took payment of £_000 then when i turned_up at faulty towers the owner demanded £_000 before i gave the keys .
F	they again sent out another chair which had the yet again the same problem . all the while i was having to stay at work to take delivery of the chairs and be there when the faulty ones were collected - quite an inconvenience to be honest !
F	alwaya use this site and company , shop on line with viovet
M	delivery , removal and courtesy afforded with the delivery was also first_class , keep_up with exellent goods , service and cost as we are pensioners and a saving of £_000 paid for the plumber and fitting .
M	not good . but hey , that '_s not sunglasses_shop '_s fault .
M	when i did order something it was received easily and well_packaged !
F	i '_ll definitely use argos again but perhaps for a product like this i '_ll use a different company where i can inspect it before i buy .
F	you had a tough time because of the fire at the suppliers , but you spent half hour talking me through your stock to get my order perfect !
F	you were warned .
F	the two costumes i ordered arrived quickly . the childs santa costume i ordered was minus the santa beard !!!
F	be aware that when they say they can substitute they apparently mean practically the entire arrangement .
M	envelope arrived on saturday_morning .
F	took quite a bit to be received which is no fault of the company , but then was atleast 0_days after they had received it when i received my money
M	the star_rating is the wrong system , the people on the phones deserve the full
M	prices are the lowest on the web and delivery fast and no cost .
F	could they please update this system !
F	it was agreed the tyre would be fitted the day after , but in the morning .
F	however , i did receive the correct cover by return of post .
F	just one eye ( my left ) feels_like it might be too strong , and i end up getting a pain above that eye after wearing them for more than 00_minutes , which doesnt_happen with my older glasses !
F	i have finally received all of my order - several months after_placing it .
M	as it was our_honeymoon we received some fantastic upgrades along the way but the hotels we stayed at .
M	great selection , great turnaround .
M	then you get another text saying they attempted to deliver the product and you were not there !
F	really simple process to get the ' ticket ' and i found a parking_space very quickly .
M	not good enough .
F	should have had laser_surgery years_ago - it is so freeing not to depend_on glasses .
F	so much choice even for my fussy furry but best of all is the incredible delivery .
M	i used stress_free parking at heathrow .
M	the products were good quality but i ordered a 0metre component video cable and i got a box that had 0 metres printed on the front .
F	never ordering from them again , hotel_chocolat on the other hand were excellent .
M	i informed aria about the problem through their website and explained i could not afford to send the item back and that coming into the store before 0pm would prove probably too difficult .
F	thank_you
F	good price and delivery on time
F	very pleased with my outfit looked the se as it did online .
F	that '_s why they keep you leaving on hold and that is why they called to clarify .
F	they finally arrived at 0 . 00 am
F	the staff arranging order and delivery couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
M	?
M	i will never again buy a computer with this pre installed .
F	i rate this company as one of the best iv come_accross and i purchase always always rom my pc
M	( it must be easy if i managed it !)
F	i eventually gave up on the after sales_team and decided to speak to the sales_team who miraculously answered the phone immediately !
M	the service was very quick ( next_day delivery ).
M	if it was just westin i had had to deal with i ' d certainly have given 0 or 0 .
F	she rang back to tell me that there was in fact an issue with the courier and she would refund my delivery fee ( and ended_up refunding the total price ).
M	intensive rehearsals break some ( admittedly tired ) drum_heads with a gig to follow .
F	i find it tacky .
F	very nice flowers - the recipient said they were beautiful but problem in online transaction . original recipient address and greeting were lost by e . florist and all had to be put through a second time . l . but fairplay to the customer service team they
M	order items :
M	i checked the website and i found in the time i had sent my ipad they had dramatically dropped the price of the trade in on ipad 0 which is fine , but i found they had rated my ipad in bad condition - scratched front and back , with a dent on the side apparently !
M	the site is simple and the prices are great .
F	thats how good jules_b is .
F	not enough comparison photographs .
F	thought paying 0 . 00 for mothers_day delivery was acceptable .
F	no direction from her solved the situation but then everything went down_hill .
M	good price , good comms & fast delivery .
M	cant_fault them
M	i booked a flight with tripsta on the 00th of june .
M	easy to order on the net , kept_informed all the way and delivery guy was bang on time .
M	i received an e_- mail telling_me it would be here on a certain day which wasn_'_t convenient , so i followed a link and changed delivery , very easy to do , i then got another confirming changes , and also telling_me i will receive another on the day of delivery giving an approx time , it arrived with an_hour time_scale .
F	the rugs i have had are excellent quality and i got 00_%_discount on my 0nd order , very nice .
M	the range could do with expanding on performance parts
F	cannot say how good or bad the product is that i purchased , as i have not opened it yet .
F	i recommend the procedure completly painless , but the aftercare is poor .
F	i still have heard_nothing even_though i emailed customer_services !
M	extra drivers are 0 euros plus_vat per day and unless you take their very expensive waiver_insurance , the a deposit of 000_euros is reserved on your credit_card etc , etc .
M	first_class service great quality and the after sales is amazing nothing to much_trouble for this company .
F	i have emailed them several_times and have had a few replies apologising for the delay and assuring_me that my cheque will be sent out in the post that day , it still has not arrived .
F	from very dissatisfied mum ,
F	however i was pleased with the quality of the clothes i ordered and their service was first_class .
M	if i want something that is cheaper_elsewhere jessops will do their best to match it if not beat it .
F	but i '_ve taken today off work to make_sure i was in for my delivery , but instead i '_ve got an e_- mail telling_me that dpd attempted to deliver my parcel and no - one was in .
M	essentially , they are stealing my money .
M	so much time had elapsed since i ' d placed my order that the price had now changed too .
M	harwich
F	fully_understood what i required , explained that it could be returned if_necessary .
M	?
M	ordered a couple of items before_christmas .
F	my very elderly friend was delighted with her flowers - but she would not have received them had it not been for her neighbour , who took them in for her when they were thoughtlessly left on the doorstep by the delivery person .
F	never again .
M	shocking .
F	the site was great , but the difference in quotes was phenominal .
M	the flowers helped bring joy and comfort to our family .
M	easy purchase , good communications and fast delivery in_spite of very bad road conditions !
F	wanted a new black toyota hilux invincible wheel arch .
F	i purchased some herbs from indigo_herbs and can highly_recommend them .
F	the following_day i again phoned the
F	love the mr .
F	delivery was relatively quick but my account delivery information on the website was a little ambiguous - an estimated delivery time would have been reassuring .
F	!
F	on their site ) yesterday and a follow_up one today but still not response !
M	on top of the late delivery , the mouse i ordered was not included nor was any explanation as to why it wasn_'_t included , i was forced to call their support_team myself and enquire , only to be told that they were awaiting stock and then that the mouse i had ordered had been_discontinued .
M	my flight landed at terminal two .
F	will never use again .
F	i gave topcashback a go because i was becoming a little dis - enamoured with one of its main_competitors .
M	it came back a month later and would no_longer work at all .
M	from royalmail -- means you did not pick_up the item .
F	come on that '_s crazy !
F	no problem , i knew i would be able to get on the 0pm . the traffic was horrendous and i arrived at dover at 0 . 00pm .
F	thank_you !
F	i have travelled many_times on this ferry and always have a pleasant journey but very sad about this one . wont_be booking a meal again as its abit of a rip - off !
M	for otc ( over the counter ) goods chemist_direct are fast and reliable .
F	i found partyrama the most user_friendly website on the internet .
M	they also dispatch within a few_days of the order .
F	their customer service team were rude and unprofessional and completely talked over me and even more shocking was the fact that the customer service manager <_name_removed_> was even more guilty of this than the customer service representative <_name_removed_> …. i have to say i felt sorry for <_name_removed_> after_speaking to <_name_removed >….!
F	well_packaged
M	the technician was quick , friendly and efficient .
F	i have made two purchases with quidco , both online for tp toys and currys and both tracked .
M	i got no replacement phone and the guy gave_me a mobile number to call the store on and suggested i leave it a week or so .
F	they won_'_t collect from or deliver to us but this didn_'_t stop them from accepting a booking from an ebay_seller i bought from recently .
F	it made a bad day terrible even after i had been assured by the help_desk prior to purchase that the flowers would be of good quality as i was concerned because i do not live_near to where the funeral was taking place .
F	on tuesday 00th , when it still hadn_'_t been received , i called and have been promised it will be with me on thursday 00th .
M	delivery was prompt .
F	one operative left more damage than when he started , i . e .
F	told one item out of stock and replied asking for no alternative just send the other two items .
F	not only was this un - nerving and unusual , i didn_'_t know if i had been charged .
M	service was great and price was the best around by far .
M	they are usually more_expensive than most too .
M	we were accepted into bars we were not previously allowed into due to guest lists .
M	third time of use , really good range , quick delivery , good communication .
F	well_done house_network - i am an advocate .
F	once i settled on the times , the actual booking went_smoothly and the tickets or etickets arrived promptly .
F	i am a very happy customer and plan to use drinkfinder . co . uk again .
F	i knew what i wanted from indigo_herbs before i went on the website , however i was surprised at the cost of postage and packing and felt that the 00_%_off was a catch as you had to purchase the set amount .
F	will never ever use again .
F	i will never knock your coffees i just felt that they just didn_'_t quite satisfy that yummy feeling i get with nespresso_capsules and club .
M	i have several parcels still with clients not collected that i have paid interparcel for in advance .
M	a similar brand at sw was more exp and their ship rate was over $_00 , totalling $_000 .
F	will definitely use them again .
F	thank_you for your help .
M	either that or they did not understand because they are based in spain .
M	day 0 ) order confirmation received
F	it was collected the following_day , but i had paid_extra for a service i could have got cheaper if i had originally selected a 0 - day delivery .
M	the seats , as promised , were fantastic , block b , row j - 0 rows from the stage .
F	always quick to arrive and competetive_prices .
F	would recommend this site to anyone .
M	this website saved me all the inconvenience of phoning around , to find the tyres i wanted & then having to take them , to be fitted .
F	would definitely ( actually have ) recommend to a friend
M	not only have i not had a royal_mail card through the door , but considering the other reviews here , does anyone really think it likely that they ' re telling the truth ?
F	item showing as in stock with 0 - 0_days delivery , ( i therefore chose not to pay for next_day delivery ) and expected the watch within a week .
M	good price and quality and fast delivery what more can i say thanks guys a +++++
F	i would tell all my friends and family looking for a quality brush_set to buy from crown !
F	and i did receive the furniture i bought .
M	i '_ve been very impressed .
F	hope its helpful feedback
F	i too have had atrocious service from hermes on selling something on ebay and i am_appalled that companies such as monsoon and next are using such a rogue company and shan '_t be shopping online without checking which couriers people are using first .
F	and filling out my prescription was easy with the instructions provided .
M	the delivery was well_organised , prompt and smooth .
F	we went to put it up for him on the saturday only to discover that we had several extra bits and pieces in the delivery which obviously didn_'_t go with the trampoline we had ordered .
M	she placed the box up on end in our doorway which was upside_down , rang the doorbell and left although my wife answered very quickly .
M	for those that want the facts they are joint 00th with sainsburys .
M	on paper / website it all seemed like a good deal until it arrived and i saw the quality of the connectors .
M	some parts are a bit shabby ).
M	i had to contact them to chase up my order a number of times , the guy i dealt_with was very helpful but an issue with a supplier shouldn_'_t have been at my expense .
F	!
F	what the site fails to mention is that eflorist may accept your order but actually your flowers will only be delivered if they can then find a local_florist to fulfil the order .
M	in fairness oe have been attempting to assist me throughout this with my aftercare regimen , and i am still hopeful that my eyesight will settle_down ( even_though i am upset and angry that the true likelihoods of various side - effects were not fully_explained to me prior to having the procedure ).
F	the goods were packaged very well and arrived from england quickly .
M	when i tried to use the voucher it said invalid , i emailed them and got a response one day later telling_me to try another code , which i tried and surprise_surprise it also said invalid . after yet again another email_explaining my anger and another day went by , they tell me to go_ahead and place my order and they will refund the £_00 , like i '_ve heard that before !
M	fast response with regular_updates on delivery .
F	i '_ve e_- mailed twice and have tried to call everyday and like others say there is no response or it just cuts off .
M	i made the change less_than 00hrs since paying and the brochure price for the new holiday was over £_000 cheaper yet they gave_me £_00 back , it would have been cheaper to go to the travel_agents , they tell me there would have been no charge for this , but how do you fight your corner properly at the end of a phone ( which by the way cost me over £ 0 )
F	je_commande régulièrement sur northern_parrot , et_j ' en suis très_satisfaite .
M	have used paypal for many_years .
M	no email to advise of a delay .
M	i would have made alternative_arrangements had i known
M	cannot_fault the transaction ; excellent price , free delivery and very quicklyrecieved .
M	i did like the reassurance that it would be with me soon delivered by ups .
M	mr_memory delivered the goods - the next_day .
F	this meant she went all day thinking we had forgotten her_birthday - sad for an old lady .
F	pleased with my vase as it was on sale and it adds a modern touch to our living_room
M	i would recommend your service to other pet_owners .
F	the product was far too small and when i tried to return it i was told i could not get a refund as it had been tried on !
F	!
M	on arriving home i contacted alpha_rooms and they tried to blame a different agent .
F	i have spent almost £_0k with this company and have been completely messed about .
F	as they never have enogh staff there to serve .
M	the second response was an_apology for the first response - and didn_'_t help advance the customer service situation whatsoever .
M	other_websites do this so why whisky_exchange doesn_'_t is deterring me from coming_back to them more ofter .
M	hours of call and text outage is almost_unheard of these days .
F	edit
M	none in stock .
M	ann is a very rlaxed profestional photographer who_understands that she has a most_important job , to capture on film speaciel moments in peoples lives that they will be able to look back on with pride for years to come .
M	i then noticed the different name ( time talk ).
M	not good .
F	delivery was slow , ordered 00th_march did not receive until 0nd_april , at a cost of £ 0 . 00 i think is expensive .
M	last time you sent it to the wrong_address and caused a great nuisance to my neighbours in getting it back before you would send it to the correct address .
F	bought a duvet_cover and pillow_cases and love them ; great pattern , colours and material .
M	very resonable_prices
F	the only_thing i would like to see is that possibly finding a way of lowering the courier charge for small items .
M	so despite the original mishap dpd resolved the matter asap and so i have added a star to my rating .
F	i bought 0 sets of party bags which were sent in very large box for their size and was charged postage £ 0 . 00 which i consider excessibe for 00 paper party bags .
M	it went together well but at the end i felt that it could be a little more rigid with an improved design ( e . g .
M	hollow promises about how they are ' on the seller '_s side '.
M	been looking on their website at other products and i will be ordering more stuff i hope this small review helps you .
F	we were kept_informed by email and text as to when the bed would be delivered .
F	great service .
F	today , 00nd february , she received another delivery of tulips from some florist in padiham , address given as 0 ribble court ,
M	the delivery wasn_'_t up to scratch however : i ordered on a thursday_evening and expected everything to arrive on the monday as next_day delivery is advertised , however when i called on monday it turned_out that it hadn_'_t been sent , i got an_apology but no explanation .
M	i ordered the part that day , it arrived the next_day and it took me 00_minutes to fit the new part .
M	the head track ( pressed aluminum ) was buckled and bent , however i could bend it back .
M	i contacted the service desk and it took several days to resolve .
F	on the 0nd i finally got through to be told that the parcel was being returned to me because i hadn_'_t confirmed the telephone_number in time for them to contact the recipient .
F	which clearly_states on there site they have not delivered it and still have not refunded since 00rd_april when parcel was due 00 days ago .
M	the process of just placing one simple shipping note onto a parcel is perfect for me .
F	the experience was ok .
F	three_months later , i started experiencing issues with my samsung_s0 .
M	i thought cdi , meant a button start .
M	i ordered from elitekeys today as i wanted to get into wow as i have just stopped_playing my other mmo due to it being pay0win .
M	a bit annoyed that the " pharmacist " wanted details on using product and using a box with airbags to deliver two boxes of pills was over the top , and using parcel_force to deliver is never ever good , they never can wait_until anyone answers the door .
M	delighted with spped of delivery
M	it was quick and easy
M	when i arrived to have them fitted they found out that they were of 0 different_sizes .
F	as above
F	you advertise goods that you purport to have in stock when clearly you haven_'_t .
F	we knew how busy and expensive it was going to get so thought we would be sensible and book immediately .
M	you are expected to provide suitable packaging - which is quite important as if the phone is damaged in transit it will seriously affect how much you receive .
F	did you know you can pay a little extra for the car to be returned to you at the airport to . handy if you have little_ones arriving early / late hours !
M	not a good experience !
M	i am disappointed that this was not indicated on the website .
F	it covers quite a bit , is pleasant and informative .
M	part shipped with a quick delivery and looking_forward to receiving the later part of the order .
M	don_'_t sell much these days as a hearty 00_% is lost with ebay + paypal combined fees .
M	will be using again
F	my goods were delivered very quickly and were a lot_cheaper_than i could have got them elsewhere .
F	opened the next cardboard_box and a plastic_bag containing my black fitflops such dissappointment as i wanted to keep them nice until the summer .
M	really helpful staff and great products , i spend way too much money here but will be back to spend more soon .
M	david : yodel have delivered this in error , are you saying i have to pay for yodels mistake ?
M	a bit of a wait for my kit and the shower chair had a broken weld .
F	i am not satisfied at all with the service i have received for this purchase .
M	been a little_apprehensive prior to making my purchase ; often when you see a good price for a product you wonder " what will go_wrong with the purchase ".
F	i was very happy with the flowers they looked very cheap something i could have brought from the supermarket for £_00 .
F	unfortunately their system didn_'_t know the pin provided by preloved themselves .
M	i have bought from this site on several_occasions .
M	i ordered the sennheiser hd0 dj headphones only to realise something beyond my control forced the need to cancel my order .
M	the rip was over 0 centimeters long and ( naturally ) some contents have spilled into the postal packaging .
M	will go back .
F	well made , good fitting , smart waistcoat .
M	you will remain my first choice when it comes to enquiries & music books etc .
F	quality is good , value is good , delivery is quick
M	the of course charged my card on the same day .
M	i personally feel you get more than your money '_s worth in cut alone .
M	great price with it being second_hand and next_day delivery was great ; however the pictures did not show any wear to the top of the headstock , and i can only surmise this came from the woeful packing of the instrument which had been crammed_into a standard guitar box with no case and had the lid taped shut around it .
M	and so this dispicable saga goes on .
M	i don_'_t have a lot of money , and they offer some of the best quality protein around for the price , and it '_s delicious .
F	this meant the whole_process from first point of contact to the car landing on my driveway took 0_weeks .
M	what a surprise two_days_later .
M	!
M	do not use .
M	goods were delivered as_described and within the timeframe quoted .
F	we were 0 hours away from calais when we got a text_message_saying that the ferry was cancelled and we would be accommodated on one leaving at 0pm and we were asked to check in by 0 pm .
F	would use this website again , once i run_out of supplies .
M	price was good and delivery was super - fast ; ordered sunday , arrived tuesday !
M	i can see myself buying from cryo pc again when i need to upgrade my nano . which won_'_t be for a while yet !
F	cannot_fault them and would recommend them to anyone .
M	i purchased one key and passed the anti_fraud_checks and was emailed stating all further orders would be instant with no further checks , i purchased the same key again for my brother and was again sent an auto email requesting for anti_fraud_checks , of which i replied but unlike the first key i have not yet recieved the 0nd , this is poor as i was told further orders would have no issues , the payment was succesful but i recieved no key , i tried to contact support via skype , facebook , twitter and email , but with no replies , i am not happy with this service .
F	first time purchasing glasses online , it was easy to choose frames and the home service made it easy to see which suited my face the best .
F	i have usually received my products within 0_days .
F	great value and fitting service was excellent - very helpful staff !
F	our night at the games doesn ’_t finish until 00pm ; it will be a real_pleasure rushing out of the stadium and back to the train_station .
F	i decided rather_than a cheque i would take an argos_voucher which_meant 00p more for my phone .
M	we were progressing quite well as far as magaluf but then we had to go to the further hotel away from magaluf ( 00_mins each way in the bus ) and then did the same after perguera .
F	they have fast shipping to keep me going and keep me healthy .
M	do not trust anything they say .
F	again , nothing arrived .
M	the customer service has absolutely_terrible , i think i have made about 00 calls to them , each lasting more than 00_minutes at a time and only ever recieved 0 call_backs after being told each time i would get a call of a manager and on top of the calls about 00 e_- mails have been sent and the only responses i seem to get are generic ' we ' re sorry ' e_- mails , this all started when they gave_me incorrect information over the phone which resulted_in them not taking payment from my account and charging me a fee , not all i asked was for them to pay half the fee and i '_ll pay the other half . that was 0 months_ago :( very unhappy and stressed out !!!!
M	the surface i could fix , so i just raised the not square edge .
F	i agreed to the repair but after waiting a considerable number of weeks as the manufacturer was busy i became fed_up of waiting and asked for a refund .
F	the two tops were more than 0_months late , i received no word as to when they would be ready or what was happening even_though i asked several_times .
M	great service , quick delivery - all you want !
F	needless to say there is still no sign of the bean_bag despite my delivery date being changed 0 times and groupon '_s assurance that it would be delivered by 00th_february .
M	!
F	fabulous service .
F	would hesitate to use this company again unless i was buying an item for myself .
M	;-!
F	this is my very first order from this company & i have not been disappointed in any way whatsoever , because of this i will certainly be using them again & hopefully will remain one happy customer :)
F	the search parameters are excellent .
F	i am now expected to take unpaid time off work to accept their 0 - week late delivery , and i will also have to unassemble and move my old bed myself ( as i said , i am a girl in my 00s and i '_m not great at diy or lifting ).
M	after a search for new tyres i stumbled_across grippy .
M	since then within 0 months the seat has broken , it '_s needed a new tyre , it turns_out they didn_'_t service it at all so we had to spend over £_000 on that , it has continuously givn error codes and engine warning lights , various_bits have fallen_off and to take the mickey now the turbo is only boosting at 0psi and we '_ve so_far spent_hundreds without getting to the bottom of why it '_s so slow now , can '_t even keep_up with a petrol tanker going up a hill ( true story :( ).
F	pharmacy0u is a great service for people too busy to collect a prescription and get it from a chemist .
F	good branded products at a great price , delivery is quite quick , and items always as expected .
F	i was very dissapointed to find out the extra driver that i had requested and presumed paid for , which stated on my receipt ( paid in full ) i was charged a futher 00 . 00_euros for extra driver and 00 . 00_euros for fuel when picking the car up talk about having you over a barrel .
M	in any case the experience was positive overall .
M	excellent service from_start to finish .
F	easy , cheap and fast
M	i then noticed that one of the prongs on the mains_plug was bent and would not fit in the mains socket .
F	i will not be using viovet anymore .
F	after much emailing between me , serenata and their delivery company yodel i eventually got my money reimbursed but it was a shame because i just wanted to cheer_up a friend with a gift , not have loads of hassle .
M	i have used your services for many_years and recommended to family and friends .
F	happy_puzzle co . is a good site for interesting games and puzzles to attract kids ( and grown - ups ) away from consoles and laptops .
F	nice .
F	sometime later we returned to the cabin , went to look at the menu and it had gone , we were furious that someone had been in our cabin and reported this to security , who called the restaurant manager to see us , after much discussion it was admitted that they had taken the menu and sent us a bottle of wine to the cabin by way of an_apology .
M	wil shop with you again
F	! don_'_t use
M	quality / depth of service is certainly better_than hers when we both have signal but she has signal more often than i
F	the recipient was in , but was given no chance to get to the door .
M	hermes is also more difficult to track than collect_+.
F	so , that makes me a little uneasy to be helping a company make money out of africa or wherever .
F	!
F	the costs of the products are very competitive a lot_cheaper_than the vets !
M	i am_disgusted and will never use viovet or their courier , city_link , ever again .
F	eventually thay recontacted animed to confirm that no signature was required , and the package was delivered with no problem the following_day .
F	0 ) safety_pin on headdress shows from the front
M	very pleased with the service offered .
M	payment was sent ok but took a very long time to arrive .
M	place your order and you get it as_described each time .
F	i bought some items from procook the service was brilliant and the items have a 00 year garantee which is exercelant i will purchase again from them
F	i could have picked something like this up at accessorize for a quarter of the price .
M	0 excellent service , communication , delivery faster_than a speeding_bullet !
M	we were so badly_let_down by this company that it almost cost us our own business .
M	i also ordered a business stamp , but it was that hard to get into , that it broke :(
F	very easy company to deal with .
M	i would definitely recommend - great service !
M	i got all the details from the person i talked to the second time and they were very apologetic but it wasn_'_t helping_me much as they said it was too late to turn him around now .
M	i then wired up the lights as per quite good instructions , however the right indicator flashed the left lights and vice_versa .
F	i bought the pet corrector and they have stopped , it works_wonders and is half the price in the pet_shops .
F	having always bought our park tickets from uk travel_agents i had my reservations using internet site .
M	couldn_'_t find a better price online .
F	im now waiting for them to resend it !
F	do they not ever open their mail then ???

F	!
F	everything ordered was present and correct and i am very happy with all items .
F	i would recommended to go to this parking . what a service top top
M	the matt_black paintwork was covered in grease marks , presumeably from the build .

M	please go away , i am not your friend .
F	i ordered a vintage - look hair_comb for my wedding .
F	by choice i '_ll never use them again .
F	brilliant
F	the communication i have received so far in joining the company has_been second to none , the lady was very helpful .
F	my order arrived the next_day what better service could you get !
F	if your website would have said the shower wouldn_'_t be available for the monday , i wouldn_'_t have ordered it !!
M	kept me informed on progress of order .
F	i was delivering of my goods as stated on the email i had received , 0_days after that a knock came to my door , me thinking it was the delivery driver opened the door , took delivery , when the person_who had brought it advised that he actually lived in the next road which is called meadowcroft road , i am mighty grateful to him as he could have just got rid of it , i don_'_t know how you can deliver goods to a wrong_address when it was clearly_stated on the parcel where it was going , yodel , get your act_together
F	lenses arrived on the following working day .
F	ordering was quite simple but when i saw the delivered flowers they were not quite the same as i had ordered .
M	but if there is more hassle with couriers , i might go back to my usual online website .
F	i '_ve stayed in two properties now : one in paris and one in edinburgh .
F	do yourself a favour and order elsewhere .
M	the final item was a set of pc speakers .
F	while i may get a refund of both deposits , it is simply a credit_note to be reused on shiply , not my money back .
M	i might as well give that extra little_bit of money to the company .
F	i hope so .
M	not what i expect from a moden internet company .
F	last december we ordered springsteen tickets for the june 00st concert at the stadium of light , we chose 0 tickets @ £_00 . 00 add on booking and delivery fee plus_vat and the total charge came to £_000 . 00 fair_enough !
M	i did all the chasing with no feedback .

M	comparing the nutritional value to the uber marketed brands of the pro teams it is easy as good and a lot less , delivery and follow_up support is great from myprotein
F	the delivery wasnt quite what i expected for the amount that was payed .
F	other instruments good .
M	update .
M	00mins on hold to speak to somebody .
M	this time i booked on a saturday_morning .
F	never in all my years of online shopping have i received such appaling service .
M	!
M	all and all a great website and idea but the customerservice does need to improve .
M	when i called the lady_who answered was very helpful but informed me that as the free delivery offer applies only to web orders , if i wanted to buy the belt it would have to be separately with a £ 0 carriage cost . adding over 00_% to the price .
F	great system where vet sends in prescription that sits on the system waiting for orders and reorders .
M	( uk mail ).
M	( amazon replaced the damaged goods without_any fuss - proves how cheap hdnl must be !)
M	eight boxes sent by collect_+, all delivered to mm within 0 days but in some cases not “ received ” by mm for 00 days .
F	i bought the steampunk sally costumes , thanks to a customer review i knew what it came with and what it didn_'_t include however trying to get the additions on the website has_been impossible and i had to shop elsewhere , the costume also wasn_'_t everything i expected the sizing is off , says standard 00 - 00 luckily i '_m a 00 so it fits but it would never fit my mother who is a size 00 so if i were any larger i would have been really disappointed .
M	my sister was driving her car and hit the kerb which gave her a flat tyre at night and she could not get the wheel off to replace , as it was on a busy_road at night and a lone female who was in a panic and crying .
M	came out into the reception_area she asked_him a question concerning print times .
M	order was pulled off without_any_problems .
F	however after_contacting , lesley at customer_services , the problem was sorted_out fairly easily .
M	my order was delivred within two_days - brilliant !
M	having ordered the chair from the site was easy and delivery was prompt but the quality of the product is way below acceptable standards .
F	many_thanks
M	won_'_t be using these again ( as well as axis care hire in montpellier aitport - but that '_s another story !!)
M	whilst there are genuine sellers i saw one locally which looked to be good to be true .
F	very upset that the package wasn_'_t going to make it in time for my grandmother to see it , i spoke to the manager who repeated the same policy and process .
M	i have recommended them to many friends .
F	the tickets i got were for the nottingham arena show on 0st april_0000 .
M	required 0 union tubular latches in brass 00mm .
M	when the website ' same day service '.
F	whats the point of paying for postage then because of the p / f stupid rules the postman cannot leave a package no matter_how safe ur property so u have to go and collect it . so whats the point of paying for delivery ?
M	0 .
M	yodel : im very sorry to hear this david .
F	i have no problem with the goods or the quality of them but someone needs to look at your delivery procedure .
F	they love in a small bungalow !
F	i explained each time that my partner has not spoken to my parents and i send presents on the side without him knowing , again they told me don_'_t worry your mum will get her hamper monday , ok . it was friday now , so what happened next , yes the next bloody day , i got a hamper , my mum got a hamper and my partner , was like what the hell did you , order a hamper for !
F	we waited_until thursday_afternoon before one final call to interparcel .
M	they have been quick to respond to any issue and have been friendly and courteous - a big contrast to streamline . net ( my old host who took days to respond to a ticket !
F	i ordered my brushes and within 0_days they were with me , i thought hey fantastic delivery !!
F	i feel with your quote of £_00 . 00 was right for my mobile in almost perfect_condition .
M	so i rang waltons to ask for replacements , and was told they would be " attempt " to deliver them " within about 00 - 00 working_days ".
F	i would advise anyone reading this , to think_twice before buying from this company .
M	00000 / 000000 / 00 ).
F	i asked if this was not somewhat defeating the object of " 00 - 0 advice ".
F	however , today the flow was noticeably slower and on inspection it was blocked with debris .
F	they will not return your item if it is not delivered or damaged .
F	after waiting approx 00mins , i was answered by a very offhand fellow who told me he didn_’_t have access to my account and therefore could not discuss my account with me .
F	delivery so fast .
M	i have ordered many things from zavvi , and mostly everything has_gone_smoothly .
M	resolved problem by making due payment but was still chased by their debt_collectors for payment which had already been made and whose non payment was the fault of talk_talk .
F	another 0_weeks in total after my original 0 - 00 days delivery , who_knows_how long it would have been if i hadn_'_t been emailing for some information .
F	i have used the long_stay car_park regularly , for some time now .
M	days_later , i got refunded via_paypal to the sum of £_00 . 00 .
F	the first response was very friendly , but so far that hasn_'_t done any difference .
M	huh_?
M	so in summary , use them , know what you ' re getting but have a back up plan .
M	!
M	!
M	when the new 0s stops working the customer service refer you to an o0 shop - who will have nothing to do with you .
F	when cityklink arrived the next_day to collect he said he had left the area when he received notification of the pick_up the previous day .
F	i have used petplanet before and encountered much the same issues , albeit not quite the same delivery wait but the customer service provided is all the proof i need to not order use petplanet again .
F	after looking into it i have found that they have added my husband to a discount scheme that he does not recall agreeing to .
M	excellent service , good communication kept me it touch with every_aspect of my purchase , and last but not least excellent value will use this company again and again
F	although the site said standard delivery was between 0 and 0 working_days i was still nervous they wouldnt turn_up on time .
F	i emailed to express my disappointment and the response was a little scathing although i was told eamonn would be in touch .
F	guess_what ?
F	the trouble is , at_least 0 of my parcels have disappeared during_transit and it '_s subsequently taken well over a month from order to recieving the replacment .
M	i do not think with the reviews that hermes are getting on trustpilot . com and also facebook that they will be around for much longer .
F	i know that pure linen is expensive but it is a worthwhile investment as it will last years and the best part is it just gets better with every wash !
F	we arrived @ dalaman_airport and found the coach straight_away a transfer that normally takes 0 . 00_hours took nearly 0 hours we ended_up getting of and walking to our hotel as we had to change buses and the driver didnot have a clue_where he was going
M	super hurtig ekspedition - det kom med_posten dagen_efter jeg_bestilte det .

F	it never came .
M	superb !
F	this morning monday 00th_november i tried " live_chat " again only to be told that theyg have no access to existing orders !
M	still no card arrived .
M	bought a black & silver pen & decided to have it engraved - when it arrived the engraving was in gold - phoned up to say not happy & was told i should have checked the small_print seems it happens a lot !
F	items took a good 00 days to arrive .
F	great watch , very happy .
M	cars were roomy and great fun economical too !!
M	the delivery drivers ( who ' d tried to deliver the first one ) didn_'_t even bother getting out of the van as they knew the size of the wardrobe and the size of our stair way and that it wouldn_'_t fit .
F	this order was completed to my complete_satisfaction .
F	i read a few of the reviews and decided to go with them .
F	0th_row back and in the middle - we could not have had better seats and loved the show .
M	this is exactly_what i wass looking for and delivered very quickly , so i was not left_hanging_around waiting for my order .
M	they told me to send the device back , which i did by special delivery with guaranteed delivery by 0000 on the monday .
M	and if you ' re in any doubt about sizing , there is helpful guidance there for you also .
M	the parcel was a set of used brake calpiers from my classic car on route to being refurbished .
F	the message was evident on the package also .
F	i would have been happy to maybe have been offered a discount on any other order i may have placed .
F	( turns_out one of the girls wasn_'_t on the group ) anyway i called sarah ( the booking agent ) a week_later as i hadn_'_t heard_anything to be told ' i cancelled it babe ' there was just no need and they didn_'_t even email me , call me or text me or refund the money that had been paid !
M	dreadful experience all_round .
M	i am utterly convinced that every_single five - star_review of o0 i read on this site has_been written with the promise of money involved ; i refuse to believe that they are legitimate , and if any of you o0 lackeys are reading this and you ' d like to debate what i '_m saying , go_ahead .
F	i would defiantly recommend it and i have to many other arty friends !
F	thank_you !
M	this company is brill there feathers razor is by far the best ive_ever used , as long as every time you use it you should clean it , it should last a lifetime and for me to pass on to my son , also there half hunter pocket watch and stand is outstanding not only on my dressing_table but also on my waistcoat , make_sure you wear it correctly for the effect your after thanks again
F	to be honest i '_m so fed_up of faffing i '_ll probably just give the clothes away - it '_s cheap tat anyway !
F	elli gill
F	good customer service apart_from that .
F	made the mistake of buying a shower_tray from them .
M	no problem caused but would have been better had i been informed rather_than me having to chase a couple of times .
M	ordered a shower redring active 000s 0 kw which is still shown on the fastlec web_site but was sent a different model redring active a0 0kw .
F	ridiculous .
F	this ' company ' is shambolic .
F	information came through , all plain and simple .
F	good prices
F	the advisor confirmed my laptop had been received on 00rd_december but hadn_'_t been checked yet .
M	companies like this should be animal affection driven , and i think this one is .
M	lack of del instructions no del time & no tracking no .
M	i '_ve shopped with these_people several_times and the standard of their goods is excellent .
M	there were no written instructions just diagrams and arrows hence it wasvery easy to make_mistakes .
M	i ' d cut my losses and just use another magic card retailer in future ( there are lots of other options )
M	the major_issue i have with the best_western booking on line service , is that i have to re enter my details every time i book a hotel !
M	a little unfair i thought .
F	if they had said 00 days and meant it i could have decided if that was acceptable to me or not .
M	oh by the way i am still_waiting for my refund .
M	sent the phone to rotten_apples on the thursday i placed my order and assumed that it would be back in my hands by monday at the latest , allowing for the weekend .
M	good value .
M	like the product but opened up a long time after purchase as was a gift and had several marks quite disappointed
F	excellent service
M	two_weeks on and multiple emails no response for the warranty claim i need to raise .
F	0 hours since i purchased my playstation live card and i still didn_'_t receive my code . will never purchase from them again .
M	so , it '_s a way to get money back , but you will need to be really patient and it can be a pain chasing up tiny payments that don_'_t get paid without giving quidco a nudge .
M	they do not abide_by the consumer_law .
F	i tell all my ratty friends & they use little pet too .
F	no negative_feedback whatsoever !
F	so glad i have one in my high_street : p
M	loved the texting system re delivery .
F	she then arranged for an_alternative bed to be delivered the next_day witout incurring the extra saturday delivery charge .
M	my complaints began about 00months ago with emails i sent not being received and no bounce backs ( this caused a lot of trouble and i lost business as a result ).
M	at my home , i can usually connect from upstairs but little or no signal downstairs .
F	cheapest prices and great service . you have your business plan spot_on . well_done
F	she would not give me a straight answer .
M	always available on the phone but never intrusive .
F	etc - but you need to know all that anyway ).
M	it was great , i found an amazing deal with sky !
F	my delivery arrived on time , as advised
M	ps tyreleader asked for garages in glasgow and would investigate .
M	i '_m still_waiting for it .
F	however , without the voucher they would cost £_00 . 00 plus a possible postage charge of £ 0 . 00 .
F	seempelz .
F	would definitely recommend outdoor_world direct
M	the delivery was prompt and as ordered , will use regularly from now on .
M	as usual , the flowers were delivered on time , exactly as_described , and very well_packed .
M	when my mother did answer the door the driver was , in her opinion , extremely disgruntled at having been called back and was discourteous in his_attitude_towards her .
M	just read all the other reviews on them .
F	arrived at heraklion airport at midnight .
M	cheapest and most professional tennis store in the uk .
M	je pense a un problème de fin d ' approvisionnement ( méthode rose piano ) à une période ou tout le monde la veut mais mis a par ce souci si c ' est celui ci que_je comprendrai , aucune information concrète concernant le retard .
F	i haven_'_t used product yet as i am sanding all the work_tops and then new sink to go in before using osmo top .
M	this is a great cover and i can '_t believe the low price with tablet wake_up too .
F	it '_s the only place i will purchase my lenses , the website is brilliant , prices are good and the delivery time is out of this world !
M	their check out system is great .
M	it is hit or miss as to good or bad attitude .
F	if i could put 0_stars i would have .
M	looks good , but in_spite of very careful fitting , the flexible seal barely touches the top of the bath so there are slight leaks when you shower .
F	fantastic service , friendly and informative staff .
M	economy_car_rentals have accepted no responsibility for their representative in turkey and have ignored my correspondence , so i can only conclude that they too benefit from charging customers for an intermediate size vehicle and then pocket excessive profits by providing a small lower tariff vehicle .
F	however , helpful staff on hand to chat through the problem with ( even if it didn_'_t work at first !!)
M	i booked for some simple repairs to my bathroom .
F	i understand that now and again the drivers workload may be too much and they might not be able to make certain collections , but it would be great if a text or a call was made to advise of this once they realise how far behind they are .
M	nothing !
M	i have received a letter telling_me that i will have to pay £_000 termination charges .
M	i would never choose to use parcelforce unless they buck up their ideas and get real !
M	i will go back and i will stay again , then when the tap works i will give 0 * - 0 * does not give justice to this hotel
F	it '_s just that they were not as in the picture .
F	having a call_centre in manila is crazy - we need to talk to the local_depot , not some script - reading robot in the far_east .
M	i cant_wait for my next mobile_phone upgrade and tariff review , as i am more than confident it will add even more value for money .
M	shop around , you may find cheaper rates on the same travel dates , at approximately 00 weeks ahead .
M	i did use them last_year although i understand that was a different company .
M	the roses had holes in the petals and they were dry and withered ,
F	.
M	yodel tracking does say ' we are sorry , but it appears ?
M	its a great idea , however when you have to start adding in this and adding in that , i start to wonder_why i paid so much for the hamper .
M	don_'_t like their style , be careful
M	easy to use website offers all the main couriers at around 00_% less_than their own websites for ad - hoc deliveries .
M	i wanted to test their service for that initial 00 days and then if i was happy , take out a new contract .
M	would recommend their service to anyone .
F	i will definitely be a returning_customer .
M	i have never had an issue with the website , delivery of the items or the items that were delivered ( i . e .
M	cheers

F	the bodyshaper is easy to assemble and works_perfectly .

F	this is the second time i have dealt_with mazuma and i am just as satisfied .
F	i have used jessops_photo_book download service 0 times .
F	a quick and efficient service i wouldn , t_hesitate to recommend to anyone .
M	the tiny 0 . 0 " glass came in a huge 00 x 00 x 0 inch box filled with mostly nonrecyclable polyester foam fillings .
M	yawn !
M	they still owe me money , refuse to answer my letters break promises to repay me , break promises to come_back to me .
F	i would not recommend them at all
F	i joined cash_back because my mother was saying how good and quick and easy it is to make money for shopping .
F	couldn_'_t recommend your serve more , and i will_definately be using you again :)
F	apparently they know all about the bad_reviews but keep on misleading people .
M	the customer is always right , and ea should finally open their eyes to see that .
M	pros - excellent range of high_quality glasses which you can browse online and even order trials to check they fit .
M	product received as promised
M	feels_like i spend more time trying to get it working than using it .
M	la situación del apartamento fué inmejorable , pero había demasiado ruido por la noche , la calle era demasiado transitada para nuestro gusto , aunque por_lo_que vimos creo que toda barcelona es igual .
F	i have been told today that they will try to resend it .
F	my order status changed the following_day , thought my order is coming , few_days_later get an_email_saying they arnt sending either of my items and to contact them . but also they will keep trying to get_hold of one and not to contact them for 00 days ?
M	after making a purchase with these ( simply_electronics ) i decided to cancel the order , this is where the fun started .
F	got a call from jap parts saying they had the right part and in immaculate_condition at £_000 .
F	i have spoken to consumers direct who have assured me i am in the right and am_currently in the process of submitting a case to small_claims court .
F	however , i was unaware that the quote did not include_vat so a £_00 bill turned into an £_00 bill .
F	product had been out of stock for a while , as elsewhere on the net , but once it was back in stock i ordered and the product arrived very quickly in perfect_condition .
F	i would recommend rate animed_direct , in fact i have already done so .
F	other than that it was delivered fine and we are very happy with the product .
F	always polite and helpful , and hosting is totally reliable .
M	solved the problem of locking a wrought iron side_gate .
F	very fast and easy to do and had my voucher with in 0_days
F	ordered on tuesday for delivery on friday unfortunately goods were not delivered from manufacturer until friday so order was delayed till the saturday but that was suitable anyway .
F	this is my 0th blind from 000 and have always been happy , but this blind does not seem to have the same quality as the others .
M	its a great torch .
M	absolutlely worth buying from this company quick delivery and prompt attention to what you ordered
M	i don_'_t know where to go !!
M	i have bought a few items from webtogs over the last 0 years .
M	well that one lasted 0_weeks before it packed us so off it went again .
M	quick , easy and foolproof , happy days
F	on the one occasion i had any difficulty venere were quick and helpful to ensure the matter was satisfactorily_resolved .
F	however , the printed instructions for drop - off at gatwick_north were incorrect
M	these_guys were amazingly quick .
M	once calling them , no help at all , just told my money has_been ring fenced and somebody will contact me back tomorrow , after not recieving a call , try them again .
M	you are not in contact as you say in your statement .
M	very disappointed , ordering was good and keeping_me up to date with my purchase was good .
M	i originally asked for a replacement , but when it became_clear they were ignoring me , i requested a refund .
M	no complaint about service and delivery but the balls i pruchased were clearly_marked as the new dt solo .
M	i always go back to guitarbitz for most of my guitar needs as i find them helpful and friendly .
M	no communication from wae_+ at all , and no delivery .
F	and god_forbid you should be late paying your bill by a few_days they continue to harrass you at all hours even on sunday wether you speak with them or not .
M	however at the time , simply_electronics offered a singificantly lower price than any other retailer , so i went_ahead , by credit_card , and was prepared for a bit of a battle if needed .
M	right now your response just looks_like a fob off of to my review .
F	so at this point i had paid £_00 for a flat_tyre .
F	i wish i hadn_'_t gone to 0 and probably was too hasty in my plans but hindsight is a wonderful thing !
M	very good service
M	was the part really , truly , in stock when i ordered .
F	the order arrived in a timely_fashion , was well_packaged and all in all was a seamless_transaction .
M	it only took 0_weeks to receive a sit up bench i ordered from them via amazon and then i discovered that 0 or 0 items were missing from the box , not mentioning the tools to assemble the beast .
F	with a product for dogs with severe digestive_problems this is worrying .
M	- i ' d set aside a good hour of your life if you ever want to speak to them .
M	i think that the parts should be aligned before the backing tape is removed and then the application could be trouble_free .
M	i loved the blinds but unfortunately when the package arrived it looked like it was stomped on and kicked around by the couriers .
M	i '_ll only be in for a time_slot and as the goods have to be signed for by me no one else can take receipt . will it arrive in that time_slot i doubt it .
F	whilst i '_m away on holiday .
M	very satisfied with the service and the products
F	!
M	email confirmation of our booking was sent almost_immediately .
M	the flowers where badly_damaged , the packaging was ugly with soggy brown_paper wrapped around the flowers and the bunch was very small .
M	even the part number sticks in my head . ftd000 traditional pattern knob - i ended_up with 00 of the little tinkers and very happy i was too .
M	i suggest that argos follow the example of other on line companies e . g .
M	told it would be delivered by following friday 0st march at latest ., then when not received i was told by tuesday at the latest .
M	to conclude . i bought my " ticket " onto rightmove through them .
F	i '_ve always wanted to use a professional lens .
F	bought some toffee peanut_butter ( had to buy two because of the minimum order thing ) and got some protein_bread for free ( which is lovely by the way ).
F	just let_down by poor delivery service by ' nightfreight ': i was bombarded by texts and emails from early morning telling_me that my product was on its way but i couldn_'_t access any tracking informaton via the nightfreight website and nor could i get_hold of anyone - their ' live_chat ' customer service capability was always busy .
F	would most definitely use again !
M	not very convenient as order was delivered in 0packs on 0 consecutive_days and was one order
M	different_departments .
M	your sincerely
F	i placed an order of around 000 prints on 00th_march to put in an album for a 00th_birthday_gift .
M	my grandmother hasn_'_t been able to use the internet for 0 - 0 months now and i '_ve spent more than 0 hours on the phone from my mobile as i live a 000_miles_away just trying to get this resolved .
F	they are either completely disorganised or completely dishonest .
F	the tap was delivered quickly and was very nice however when i ordered the tap it didnt say that it didnt come complete with shower slide and hose .
M	city_link did not deliver to my home .
M	while the product was fine , the delivery ruined the whole_thing .
M	after checking my bank in the evening , it was there !
M	i was informed that they would be delivered out to me on friday 00nd_june .
M	fast delivery .
F	their phone just claims there is no one to take your call .
F	he gave_me the impression that they wouldn_'_t entertain it until the five days had passed .
M	that '_s another thing - i would recommend that notice to the postman be made bigger and more eyecatching for the postman to see immediately .
M	needless to say i was right - they failed to do so again .
F	i had to buy it .
M	instead a week_later and without_any email shipment notifications i received a note fro the local sorting_office - which is 0 miles_away that a parcel is waiting for me .
M	wecertainlydontcare @ webuy . com would be more appropriate in describing cex
M	i think the main problem is that i have read all the reviews and just cant trust them with more of my orders .
F	since then we contacted ebrookers many_times via phone and email , two months over still we haven_'_t received our money back , we are still_waiting for this , i hope the person_who is reading this message can understand our problem now , we are really unhappy about all this problems , we are financially struggling due to this , we might contact some expert soon , so we could get our money back .
M	this was a small local tyre and mot company who had a dynomec ltd . locking_nut removal_tool .
M	service was good , prices were rubbish .
F	even_though transaction is made online , there is a feeling that the people behind animed cares_about what they are selling and helping_us find the right product .
M	i '_ll update this when they respond , however .
F	when i rang up to complain that i '_d wanted a replacement , they said i could order it from their web_site , but the price had tripled , so it was no_longer competitive .
M	also on return , it would be better to call prior to collecting bags to minimise waiting time for cars return
M	but it wasnt .
M	unfortunately , the returns_procedure is less satisfactory and i was advised to return item by special delivery which cost me a whopping_£_00 .
F	but overall it '_s a good concept and i managed to find tenants after a few_weeks , and only lost a day or two rent due to the delay in obtaining references .
M	service was prompt and the goods we ordered were as they had been described and all in working order .
F	it '_s an alright shop but isn_'_t anything special .
F	( transaction_id_0000000 ) since this seems to be the only way to get a response from them i would like to hear something other than the generic_response that is pasted onto each bad_review on here .
M	they did the work and pointed_out some other issues that needed attention in the future .
M	i '_m always a bit_cautious_about using the internet for shopping and especially a new supplier . but things move on and a lot of business is carried_out this way .
M	but the flowers have died after only 0 days .
F	i thought i would buy this for my husband , for christmas . i found the procedure confusing , in fact i think i paid for something twice . i specified for it to be dated 00th_dec . of which it is dated .
M	not happy !
M	but not great !
F	it then took 00_mins to contact them later as phone no provided was not available .
M	no problem , so five_stars for a prompt service !
M	j ' ai contacté piscine - center sav sur ligne le même jour pour demander que une nouvelle alarme sera remise immediatement parce que_l ' appareil est obligatoire .
F	in the words of one of the major_retailers ' every little helps ' - so every time you make any sort of purchase - make_sure first you go through_topcashback and you can earn back cash , be it a few_pence , a few_pounds or even a few_hundred_pounds .
M	the packing_material in this particular box didn_'_t protect the wheel sufficiently and a large_chunk of paint was removed by citylink '_s mishandling .
F	i tried in vien to resolve this but the email only customer service were useless .
M	update_: company has offered 00_%_off this and a future order , plus doubled this particular order , but i consider this an insult .
M	quick and trustworthy !
F	we only had one problem when an electical awning came down on it '_s own and wouldn_'_t go back .
F	chap_who picked_up the parcel was very helpful and friendly too .
F	this was sorted_out by custumer services very promptly and effectively , but i do think furniture should be checked more carefully before sending it to customers who have paid good money for it .
F	i guess i expected more of leggings costing this much , and i will probably return them even_though i need something for a themed_party this weekend .
F	these bins are communal bins at the bottom of the steps , that clearly the courrier didn_'_t fancy going up .
M	well i didn_'_t want to wait , i wanted my daughter to see a consultant urgently .
M	one customer lost .
F	i bought flowers with same day delivery for my friends birthday and they arrived 0 hours_later !
M	kept_informed all the way from receiving order , to order on its way and then when order was delivered .
M	otherwise , the service provided was a expected and we will probably use dollar again .
M	so please_please_please don_'_t give them the satisfaction of your money - another company that many many_years used to be good - gone to the dogs .
F	i was very pleased with feedback from my mother in law she absolutely loved her flowers the only_criticism i have was the lack of acknowledgement from you on placing my order i did not receive an_email_saying you had received my order this caused me to panic a bit as i wasn_'_t sure if order had gone_through , i emailed you to check if order had been receive but got no reply until delivery wa s ready to go out three_days_later , i was about to order from another shop when i got a message_saying flowers had been delivered , i buy a lot on the internet , each time i get an_email_saying order has_been received . hoping this was helpful yours_sincerely mrs_c darby
M	not at all helpful when you have a problem and when trying to pay off the debt they take ages to get back to you .
F	they arrived on april 00th and 00 days_later are still looking brilliant .
F	i didn_'_t --- i wanted to know how long i would have to wait .
M	0 ) the wrong mattress was delivered , customer service said the mattress was no_longer available due to a change in stock , the result is we have had to accept a replacement mattress we did not want .
F	!
M	the chosen courier service is letting pet_supermarket down .
F	they are fab , very fast post
M	the stool was quite poorly_finished with sharp corners , in fact my wife cut her foot on one of the corners .
F	the second time misguided never gave the correct_address , missing out the building name and my parcel never arrived on the next_day delivery , after this i was told there was nothing they could do and had to wait_until monday for it to be delivered at which point was too late .
M	great customer service but the quality of coffee is not a patch on nespresso .
F	i ordered them for the day before her_birthday as we were going to france on her_birthday for lunch .
F	the bits that did arrive were beautifully_packaged and very good quality , unfortunately the items didn_'_t go with the cut of my dress so returned items which was simple and hassle_free .
M	thanks
M	never fixed a shower in my life .
F	rentalcars . com or traveljigsaw which is the same , didnt give me a refund for not giving me the service , thats stealling !
F	this was a really good site which was very easy to use and i could not believe_how quick everything went through .
M	i get books from amazon within three_days but up to now i have been waiting 00 working_days and at the moment nothing .
M	i ordered the bike on tuesday_night and it was delivered on thursday .
F	0000000
M	i also chose to have it delivered within 0 - 0 days and got it the next_day i ordered which was fantastic !
F	as i am a friend of environment ( and i could do that this time ), i chose the eco delivery ( it '_s the day when they are in your area ). only 0_days to wait so .
M	it would be best either to have a properly designated web_site or else instruct customers to process the order by telephone .
M	great service , very easy to use online and fast delivery
F	the habitation check was not produced as promised .
F	we ordered some bedroom units in the " january " sale - we expected to have to wait for them to be made but they were delivered within the proposed time and we are very pleased with what we ordered .
F	my dog licked the frustrated tears from my face ( having real wedding dress problems ) and patted my knee .
M	called viagogo to inform them that i have waited in all day and still no tickets . they told me they would contact the seller and find out what the problem was . they called back and told me tickets have been stolen !!!!!
F	a very noticeable black dot inside the middle of the diamond .
F	pour_les mêmes produits sur_le site petmed . co . uk , le_prix est nettement moins cher , malgré que_le fait au royaume uni le tva est plus haut .
F	i want to know what has full availability for my dates .
M	i was then asked to confirm by email or facebook .
M	i was emailed at every_stage , and i could track the order .
M	it '_s great but it takes_ages and the estimated payment date keeps moving further and further away , i '_ve had one claim denied unfairly and this has done my opinion for the company involved great damage !
M	millet refused to reimburse for the cost of delivery despite repeat requests and the website claiming that the cost of delivery is reimbursed if an error is made and the ' wrong item ' despatched .
F	i bought with 00_%_off which was probably passed_onto the florist so less allowance for the flowers they had to supply .
F	whole_process from placing order to payment took less_than a week .
F	i was kept_informed of the whole_process from the time of ordering to the time they got despatched and delivered .
M	then you are asked if you wish to take out extra_insurance in case you loose a key .
M	the buying process was good but was disappointed in the colour of the item .
F	just had first night and felt the difference immediately .
F	well_done .
M	arrived on time , job_done , great price - highly_recommended .
M	the only_downside is customer sevice takes_ages to answer calls & the online billing system is awkward to access - sending you a time limited pin to access your account - secure but long_winded .
M	having a third_party delivery your goods is seldom a good experience .
M	i ordered a small item for just £ 0 and expected postage to be dropped on top as i wasnt spending much .
M	will_definitely use this supplier again .
M	and i have paid for fast delivery .
M	vodafone , if you ' re listening , you need to go back to the drawing_board and work on your customer service !
M	having shelled out all that money , we would have expected more !
F	well 0o /_c came and went and i called dreams , they said the bed is out of stock and could be another month before it was in . they sad the bed was out of stock when we bought it and they don_'_t know why the transaction went through .
M	be warned !!
F	what a mistake !
M	i could not urge_anyone stronger against using this shameful company !
M	ps .
M	i returned it and a replacement was arranged within 00_hours , no_quibble - again great communication .
F	they were the right size , which is a bonus !
M	now i '_m waiting to see how much they have taken from my account .
M	it was suggested i put small stones in the bottom , great . but a bit_messy when you want to re - use them .
F	i had ran into the kitchen with fright due to the nature of her abrupt delivery , with a shaken 0 month_old in my arms and spotted her on my drive way .
F	i can '_t fault my buying experience from ao .
F	i ordered 0 separate items together and yet you delivered them separately .
M	the initial_quote then appeared to be misleading .
M	i find using the website too_busy and you can '_t easily find what you want .
M	infact everything was great until the courier basically threw the flowers at the recipient .
M	in fact the 0 hour flight we had on malaysian airlines in economy was a match for the qantas business seats .
M	i have ordered many many items and only one purchase ever arrived not as_described ( soft cover book instead of hardcover ).
F	they informed me that they would be unable to assist with this and supplied me with the name of apartment in puerto_del carmen that we could leave our lugagge at or if available an apartment we could rent for the day .
F	my advice to other prospective_buyers . be sure you don_'_t want to return an item before buying .
F	good points :- the trampoline came on the day it was promised - quick free delivery - no_hassle .
M	!. absolute_joke !
F	i emailed my order and it was delivered the next_day , great service and at a very good price .
F	no call was received , so today i called homebase online number .
M	it would have been helpful if i had clearer or any guidance on the fuel required for the particular vehicle
F	great job customer_services and well_done to the company .
M	ordered friday_afternoon , tracked the order to the local_depot and collected the order myself saturday_morning .
M	glasses are competitively_priced and certainly much_cheaper_than high_street prices , plus frequent_special_offers make for superb deals .
F	this sort of thing should be outlawed
M	the cryo / cuff is excellent .
F	she said she would attempt to find me a cleaner but 00_minutes later she called back to say there were none available !
M	would you trust your £_000 - £_000 - £_000 tv to this set - up - no you wouldn_'_t .
F	city_link attempted to deliver it twice and on both_occasions i was at work .
M	please use this online golf store to get other more reputable golf stores to price match these joke prices !
F	ordering is simple and delivery super_fast .
M	sit here for another 0 hours like a fool , listening for the door_bell ?
M	may be in order .
M	noon came and went and i tried_calling again .
M	waste of my time and my money
M	i found lawsons very good and will use them again
F	they seemed to be set in stone .
F	i will never use viagogo again .
M	whatever you do dont use this lot
F	my money was refunded quickly hence the reason for 0_star .
M	i find dealing_with my bank i need to take time from my work to meet someone in the bank and they will take a few_days to give you an answer .
M	thanks happy_puzzle company and best of luck in the future .
M	zapper is great if you have a load of old books that you '_ve read and no_longer need which are taking up space .
M	additional details - part or accessory missing from product
M	that is totally_unreasonable .
M	i ordered my items cheaper_than anywhere_else i could_find , they delivered efficiently and quickly and kept me up to date with how the order was doing .
F	called on tuesday to be told that the delivery would happen between 0pm and 0pm : no delivery !
M	not what i seem to be getting more and more of - " new or used from 0p delivery within 0 months "
F	as a result i lost a valued regular customer .
M	feedback is welcome to my email on my account .
F	i ordered tulips for mothers_day and was very disappointed in the arrangement and the qaulity .
F	it is a shame because i have been so pleased with the others i have bought .
M	they only get 0_stars because when i do order , it '_s fairly cheap , items usually get dispatched before the expected date , and the free super_saver delivery is actually pretty quick !
M	arrived in a short_period in a very secure packing .
F	i don_'_t know what happened .
M	nice guitar , shame about the lack of resolve to ensure the customer was satisfied .
F	fast delivery watch was as required .
F	the plunge dispenser had somehow been pushed down despite bubble_wrap and the conditioner had leaked .
F	always confident in buying from john_lewis .
M	told it would be sorted within 00 days which it wasnt so completed their online complaints form which , other than their auto response ` email was completely_ignored .
M	quick , easy purchase .
M	the employee couldn_'_t confirm the quantum of the compensation and the fibre '_s still not installed so who_knows_how much this will end up being .
M	i deliberated for ages about whether to send it back but in the end decided that it wasn_'_t worth the hassle because i wanted to put it up quickly before my house warming party .
M	once again ( 0rd time so_far ) we have had to delay the flooring fitters , i suspect that they are starting to get fed_up with rearranging their day due to hammond '_s inabilities to complete their work .
M	excellent service i have had from tooled_- up and will buy from them again .
M	lesson_learned - if the shirts were better fitting , i wouldn_'_t hesitate to use mt again , as the service was very commendable , but i cant trust the sizing metrix .
M	these_guys can be trusted with your most precious items .
F	telephoned yesterday and spoke to marcus - told me yodel cannot guarantee to deliver on a saturday !
M	very impressive .
M	but really . what we received compared to what we were promised were worlds apart .
M	and the staff rarely help out .
F	the service has_been terrible and i feel like they are ignoring me so that they will not have to give me a refund - an easy way to make money !
M	except this everything was fine but is not a good attitude for a big company !
F	please resend the box was damaged and the flowers bent , so disappointed when sent to my mother in law as been unwell .
M	the car_rental experience was a three way split .
M	where it '_s not available , very uses_yodel for deliveries .
F	it has warped and there are huge curly gaps between panels .
F	not a particularly pleasant . transaction .
M	i will_certainly use then again .
F	love them .
F	regards
F	i won_'_t be using again .
M	( i refuse to make a phonecall to facilitate the return of faulty items , is this even legal ? )
M	we checked many companies on the internet looking for the best price for arden_grange light dog_food .
F	please read this honest account of my problems
M	apart_from that the monitor arrived on wednesday , i liked the fact i could use amazon to pay , saves me typing all my details again .
M	i sent today registered_post a letter to ask that they make contact with me to resolve the situation and will wait to see if i have any reply .
M	pitty the same service levels given up to now was not carried on by a big car manufacturing company .
M	glasses were ordered with delivery not to my home address ( delivery address confirmed in order acknowledgement ) but delivered to home address anyway .
F	first , what i liked : excellent correspondence from westin_gourmet ( regular_updates on my order via_email and text_message ), quick responses to a query i had and a genuine willingness to help , and the order arrived on schedule .
M	i '_m unlikely to use the tinted par much now as all i '_m in the uk for the rest of the summer .
F	all items put in one parcel which makes it heavy for delivery driver .
F	!
M	despite staying in all day nothing arrived .
F	we ordered a sample 0st which came promptly and was exactly_what we wanted .
M	only response when trying to contact them is that my refund request ' has_been passed to the appropriate person '.
F	got a call on the day they were supposed to arrive to say the refrigerated items did not get loaded_onto the van and that they would be delivered the following_day .
F	as he '_d taken another day holiday off work .
M	it was a good and easy shopping_experience .
F	staff there are also v helpful .
F	when i rang the company they said the items weren_'_t in stock but my delivery would only take a couple of weeks .
F	the dinners were my biggest struggle .
F	can not fault the service we recieved from bobby at dial a flight . despite having to change travel_arrangements twice , bobby was only too happy to help .
F	the mats are well finished however and the contrasting stitching looks well .
F	update 00th_march
F	i could collect when convenient to me , rather_than having to stay at home to sign .
M	i also praised the company for the ease of ordering and the easy to navigate web_site but as they were so upset at the use of course language ( 0 b word ) they complained and had the post removed .
M	ordered a dozen_roses in the evening on monday and was delivered standard delivery the next_day by eleven ,
M	good product
M	should have taken a 00_% deposit but took the full_amount .
M	ordered the part and received it within two_days and was kept_informed via_email on the progress of more order .
M	those of us who have suffered yodel '_s delivery for amazon know to fear this and with good reason .
F	after_spending more than a very frustrating hour online trying to send flowers via m & s - and failing , i tried serenata .
M	have used guitarguitar a few_times now and each time the service is exactly the same . excellent .
M	here i am logged in , and writing a comment , but unable to post it unless i have a facebook account .
F	and ignored my following emails .
F	booked a cut and blow_dry , got told by the salon there weren_'_t any appointments available .
F	price was good for the danilon .
F	their prices are no_longer cheaper_than other stores & you can '_t alwyas get what you want .
F	he promised to speak to the boss and ring us back re : refund and unsurprisingly never returned the call .
F	because of my illnesses in my bones stomach and other parts were i have crones disease and colitis i have no idea if the bimuno is working or not .
M	my advice would be avoid this company .
F	the trouble was that i had a project in mind and some of the supplies to make this project were not sent so the other supplies were redundant as i could not make my project .
F	in the meantime i have one broken stool which i thought would have lasted more than a year , especially after paying £_000 . 00 each for them .
M	they took it back and charged us , which is fair_enough .
F	if i tried signing in the normal way , it didn_'_t recognise me - even when i requested a password reminder !
M	i used the online_chat several_times and the team answered my questions fully every time .
F	collection of the parcel was also easy and efficient , the driver was on time and was friendly .
M	there will be consequences , including this review and closing our barclays premium account .
F	i am so disappointed and shocked at the treatment i have received from this company .
M	i '_ll be getting more for christmas_presents !
F	it was dispatched quickly with greats comms but i chose the collect service as the postage was really expensive according to the delivery time options . it was listed as ' active for less ' which is a gym but no instruction was given that it wasn_'_t at the gym but weird automated metal lockers near the gym on the same industrial_estate !
M	good price '_s , good games
M	only option is small_claims court it seems .
F	online ordering was straightforward .
M	product and the advice .
F	nothing seems to be a problem , booked on line , no added_extras like other rentals .
M	i chose the free 0 - 0 day delivery however it took somewhere in the region of 0_weeks for the keys to be delivered .
F	in this day and age everybody has a mobile and and it would be no problem to phone the receiver to inform of expected delivery time or indeed if he can '_t get there .
F	came in only a few_days and the costume is better_than i had expected for the price
F	nothing .
F	york
M	five_stars all the way !!!

M	t shirt arrived in reasonable time but disappointed by the quality given the high price .
F	shape and colour great .
M	we feel it is good value for money and if one has to park a long_distance one can wait for the shuttle_bus .
F	i used the alteration service & they fit & hang perfectly .
F	in all of the phone contact with interparcel not once did i get the impression that the person i was talking to was even the slightest bit bothered .
M	great and sexy
M	i don_'_t believe the correct item was sent having paid extra for delux flowers .
F	deliveryman basically throw the bouquet into the frontdoor .
M	stay_away from doyouspain . com and goldcar !!!
M	if i can find it at the same price elesewhere , i always use that because of the appalling returns_policy .
F	i found the staff to be a bit off with me .
M	the assistant , whom i admit was very pleasant , asked me for my name and post_code so as to check on the status of my collection .
M	car_hire £_00 , damage_excess £ 0000 , damage_waiver £_00 .
F	i got a credit_note for the whole amount but have subsequently been invoiced for the goods on one invoice and the delivery on another . i . e .
F	the customer service is second to none .
F	now this would normally have not been an issue at all if only i had been given the correct information and had i not needed a car quickly .
M	i wanted five new tyres for summer use as i am planning a mammoth route through northern europe mountain ranges .
M	evidence collated after_contacting the complainants on other review forum suggests that majority as high as 00_% of the complainants had a minority ethnicity background .
M	also , earlier this year i used ryanair to travel to barcelona .
F	needed a extra long shower_curtain and the one l got is perfect .
F	ford_fiesta durashift seized after 00000 miles bought from jennings middlesbrough as an automatic turns_out it is semi automatic !!!!!
F	ie_: medium in one brand could be small in another . i orderd fleece_lined and a number of them were actually quilted lining .
M	my credit_card was charged the day i made the order , despite the product not being in stock , and will now take " up to 00 days " to be refunded .
M	- seriously i '_ve had nothing but compliments since i started wearing them .
M	a simple checkout also aided the process and the delivery option are such you can receive your product the way that best suits you .
F	he had paid the extra to upgrade to a large size but when they turned_up they were a medium_size which he was very disappointed with .
M	if it '_s too good to be true , it usually is !
F	they also took a while to be delivered , considering the price you pay the shipping should be quicker .
F	the bow that was tied was also really roughly done .
F	on the tracking website they reckon they have tried to deliver twice and no one was in so they left a calling_card .
F	i feel a replacement card and chocolates would of been a gesture .
F	quick delivery and great products
F	order the correct code but key doesn_'_t work
M	easy to place order , great comms and very reliable
F	will give a cheaper brand a try next time i need new straighteners .
F	i shopped_around for an artisan kitchenaid_mixer , these_folks checked all the boxes .
M	!
M	although at first , i was outstanded by the contract price and inclusive minutes etc , i was left_feeling disappointed after a few weeks by the lack of network_coverage around where i live ( which is a relatively large town ).
M	if you know how many orders you have , you get the necessary staff in to despatch them .
F	i was emailed about 0 times to ask my opinion in the service and now i am giving you a poor review .
M	i would never ever use this company !
M	after paying and completing my booking ( by debit_card ) i was told a credit_card would be required .
M	its not my fault that this company did not receive stock on the date advertised on their site ).
F	more trouble than it was worth but i did eventually get the package sent .
M	eventually after sending an email a lady got back to me ( sam i think ) who was polite and reassuring .
F	:(
M	the shop is great but this mail order is bettered by wiggle etc .
M	still hoping to get the goods , but not counting on it .
F	i tried_emailing and got a phone message back asking me to phone them .
F	the worst customer service i have ever came_across .
F	i mean , how can they make money on a 0nd_hand iphone when paying me £_000 ?
M	would recommend to anyone !
M	some of the places that are reviewed such as restaurants have photos of different places which are obviously in the place . some are closed_down and do not exist and in other cases i have been let_down by reviews .
F	avoid if you can .
F	i will strongly_suggest to choose the delivery with charge if u really want to buy sth here .

F	have only good words to say about glasses_direct .

F	or has fallen out of it , which isn_'_t surprising when i saw the way he squashed my valubale stuff into his manky old transit .

F	easy website to use and great choice ranging_from basics to high end products .
M	shopto are great for fast delivery ( usually next_day if you order before 0 . 00pm ), however their prices are getting worse imo .
F	i purchased a voucher in december whereby i paid £_00 and received £_00 off at coast .
M	this was also available on the website but i then had an e_- mail back to say this was not in stock and would take 0 - 0_weeks to deliver .
F	however , when trying to fit pole , it was very loose in the middle on the join .
M	i had a bad_experience ordering an item worth £_000 .
F	i immediately dispatched an_email asking what had happened , i received no reply .
M	surprised that i had to post these abroad .
F	merry_christmas !
M	this time the parcel contained the ordered puzzles .

F	i '_ve even got a couple of pounds back into my account for next time .
M	( 0 ) supposedly they sent it and and was returned to them .
F	great service and parcel arrived in the one hour_slot they said .
F	however the card is very thin and for the price of £_00 . 00 , plus £ 0 . 00 for postage , my purchase was poor value for money .
F	i have used them a few_times_now and always get excellent service .
M	whilst the online booking experience was fine and in general the delivery service was ok , it '_s a little annoying that the booking system promised something that couldn_'_t be delivered .
F	they called on my mobile to confirm the date , and even asked if this is the number i should be contacted on .
F	i ordered slate_tiles but when they arrived i didn_'_t have time to check them all , so when i did come round to doing so i realised that i had roughly 0 boxes of broken tiles , and i must_say i was extremely impressed with the way they dealt_with the situation i would highly_recommend them to anyone thank_you again xxxx

F	no phone_calls and no sofa . after_contacting argos '_s dreadful customer service centre we were again informed the sofa we had been promised delivery of for the second time was also not in stock .
F	i had to phone up as i had some questions_regarding the handles .
M	that is not the practice with other web shops that charge you only when goods are shipped .
F	so far it is one week late but not sure whose fault that is .
F	wouldn_'_t_hesitate to reccomend to everyone !
F	i was told as we hadn_'_t reported the fault within ' 00_hours ' there was nothing they could do .

F	thanks
M	the most confusing internet order i have ever had regarding shipping .
M	it gets my vote , as a returning customer .
M	this company does not do customer service beware .
M	for example , i bought a hoody for £_00 instead of £_000 .
F	they are con - artists and i will be reporting them for false_advertising !!!
M	would 000_% use this company again .
M	they do that - the next business day if after you post it ( for free ) to them .
M	look for reviews from similar people like yourselves e . g .
M	i took it and was off , before the lpool rush hour traffic !
M	not impressed he left muddy foot prints all over my kitchen_floor and even managed to get dirt and mud on my freshly painted kitchen walls .

M	manufacturer fault or damaged ?
F	you can '_t do anything .
F	main_thing i love about cams is the chat_hosts an the friends i have met on there
F	some 00_minutes later the enterprise representative asked me for more money than i had agreed to on the telephone so i refused .
F	they don_'_t even give you a return_label !
F	could have been left with neighbour or at side of house .
F	they told there was nothing they could do and they could not even match the price of the flights .
M	since i have seen my credit_report ( and its fine ) i have asked them to tell me specifically why my application has_been declined , surprisingly they couldnt tell me .
M	overall a good , but pricey experience , marred_by the exit problems .
F	my order was paid for , for express delivery and according to yodels website , was due to be delivered on 00 . 0 . 00 .
F	yes the prices are great and i am pleased with everything received now , but nearly 0_weeks having spent in the region of £_000 , with no communication at all was a little stressful .
M	i am now in the process of changing my network to a company who is serious and is not larking about , playing_games and pretending to be a business .
M	however after_speaking with couple of friends working in hotels , i got a different perspective of booking . com methods , that are very aggressive , particularly against small independent hotels .
M	avoid .
F	wenn der gutschein nicht verfallen würde , hätte ich meine bestellung schon längst wieder zurück gezogen !!
M	i did eventually work it out but it had now taken 0 days which was much longer_than the acquisition process .
F	you have just sent me an_email to say you '_ll give me some money off my next package - are you having a laugh - do you really think i '_d want to use your services again ???
M	but that is something that a customer in other_countries might want to keep in mind if they ' re worried_about midnight black bag arrests or teams of american lawyers siezing their assets and then suing them for newly invented us laws .
F	after trying to find this type of light on other_sites , this site , easy to find , easy to sort , local people which was a benefit , but ordered and delivered , love the lights , very happy indeed x very well_packed - went to different supplier in n / cle - much more_expensive even_though they promised to price match - happy with my lights from this supplier .
M	this was our second trip with dfds , the last being september last_year !

F	a different company , who the goods had then been passed to .
M	?
M	very quick turn_around with lots of communication_throughout the whole_transaction .
M	if you want to view the world of quality spirits and more , look no further than the whisky_exchange .
F	very , very upsetting .
F	ordered 0 but only got 0 but the service was sort of ok
M	whilst i don_'_t hold juno directly responsible as it could well be the pressing plant or label , it does leave a bitter_taste in my mouth and i will think_twice before ordering again .

M	after a long 00 minute wait on the phone i was cut_off , and had to call again .

M	the amp meets my requirements and i '_m very happy with the service from guitarguitar .
M	it was very frustrating to keep on asking about the status of my order and nobody could tell what was the exact problem .
M	they then sent me the item which i received the next_day .
F	get your act_together itv
M	thank_you for the swift response
M	it all arrived very quickly .
F	they finally got in touch with me in january , and said i could have a refund for the undelivered items but not the damaged items ( unless i posted them back - they were food items and i threw them out after a couple of weeks as i didn_'_t fancy hanging on to mouldy food ).
F	well_done !

M	i definately_recomend them and will be buying from them again .
F	however i did not realise that the gift bag was indeed just a slightly crumpled red gift bag to put a gift inside .
F	essex
F	we are very pleased with our purchase and the service we received .
F	fast delivery .
F	just great .
F	and without preview we didn_'_t find this out until we received our order , so we had to manually correct on each card as it was too late to order new cards .
F	i returned a faulty remote_control to them on 00 mar_0000 but have still yet to receive the refund to date , despite chasing it twice .
F	great !
F	very quick and excellent value
F	can '_t blame them for being fed_up but the delivery was rather abrupt as a result .
F	i was really pleased to find how easy and quickly you were kept_informed when setting_up my account and buying .
F	the gentleman_who received the box had my invoice details which include my contact number , payment details and home address .
F	product would benefit from being described as small sizes as it '_s a tight fit
M	netflix is brilliant for me and perfect that you can restrict access for the kids .
M	i ordered this in morning , arrived by courier next_day although i only paid normal delivery charge .
M	we ordered the kitchen a couple of months in advance this would not happen if they had proper systems and procedures in place .
F	we have to admit we feared for our car a little as we left as security doesn_'_t seem as tight as others we have paid for in the past . and have paid a similar price .
M	informed that order had not been put on delivery truck .
M	thanks for the tracking_number though .
F	the prices are good and the service was excellent .
M	lovely villa , but the description of wifi and satellite_tv is very misleading .
F	we had a lot of building work down and the house had not been cleaned in a year .
F	i did '_t see the flowers but the recipient , an elderly_lady , was delighted with the florist and the delivery .
F	several_times we havent eaten there because the food is overcooked and disgusting .
M	it would be great if all of your buses had a live narrator .
F	0 . 0_weeks since i made the order and now far too late for the special_occasion it was meant for .

M	the flowers were almost dead !
F	i had never used the chocolate_trading company before , but found an easy to use website .
F	all my emails and questions were responded to really quickly , and the final design of the sign was exactly to our logo - something we '_d struggled to get from anywhere_else .
M	i '_ve now had four orders from affordable_supplements .
F	i am a female , and although it was quite large , it was easy to lift and move , so her attitude was very bad .
F	mazuma_mobile was so easy to use .
F	ordered my oakley_goggles and received then within 0 day .
F	i have made several orders .
F	i was impressed by the speed at which my order for some braces arrived but i am disappointed that there is a big mark on one of the front clips .
M	golfonline offered to ship the golf_bag later for an additional_fee of gbp 00 .
F	great website with lots of stoc variet .
M	lots of info on the website about next_day delivery etc , but by the time the order is placed and paid for - only then do you find out ' delivery in 0 - 0_weeks '.
M	0 .
F	the soups are tasty such a butterbean , lentil and vegatable .
M	i am still_waiting for my refund .
M	treat it as something you might get , not something that is guaranteed .
M	i am now the proud_owner of my ultimate watch , a jlc master compressor extreme tourbillon after a most enjoyable buying experience .
F	the online course was great , user_friendly and was done at a pace that suited me .
F	this never arrived ; after emailing again i was told another pack had been sent .
M	so i phoned for that appointment - only to be told that they will in fact not make one without a referral from our gp .
F	on the large charger you have multiple outlets which each run a maximum of 0 sets i . e you cant go more than 00 mts from the charger - not much use on a 00 mt drive .
M	top tip_: avoid like the plague !!!!!
M	i understand , that the company do not notify buyers re dispatch .
M	why oh why does it take so long to get on and off the ship with a vehicle - especially when there are children in the car ?
M	we ordered a 0ft wide mattress , delivery was as arranged but when dropped_off men did not hang_around long enough for us to check it .
M	bought a expensive toilet_seat online , so i get it delivered and it came broken in the box and in the end it cost me !
M	i just insured with them as i had no insurance on my car and needed to go out in it , otherwise i would have taken their advice , clearly they do not want to keep their safe driving customers .
F	how lucky then , was i to have found you guys !
M	very happy with the service provided , but a little disappointed with the actual flowers .
M	confirmed payments but no money .
M	fine , efficient service .
F	thank_you !
M	my gripe is in the fact that despite emailing them and telephoning them , leaving my details for a callback to enquire_about an armed_forces discount that one of the shops confirmed they do offer , nobody bothered to reply to either .
M	the products they sell are so reasonable but the staff need some customer service training
M	when they do phone you they still dont resolve problem !
M	would certainly use again and would recommend to anyone_thinking of buying from you .
M	southampton short_stay priority car parking is in the ideal place for access to the airport and reasonably_priced but i had prebooked but the barrier wouldn_'_t let us in or out of both car_parks we had to call for help on entering and leaving .
F	then you have to pay £_00 . 00 each way for each bag you want to go in the hold .
F	i hope to be able to seek some advice to the appropriate use of the products for my clients specific conditions based on the recommended dosage and others .
F	i have been using jgd_crafts and i can tell you this , i think they are the best , they have always got what i need and more and the prices are excellent .
M	wrong - worst decision ever made
F	she '_s very professional and will request detail such as wbac number so she can " look into it " and say that she '_s sorry so more people can fall victim .
M	mypensionexpert . co . uk was next to call , well what can i say .
M	they offered my 0 %_off my next order .
M	having used viovet now for some years i am still impressed at how low their prices are compared to my local_vet that we use .
M	great example of a large company who are focussed totally on cost at the expense of working with customers when issues_arise ( as they do with even the best of businesses ).
F	absolutely ridiculous , but on the plus_side the pram is lovely .
F	this company has great products , prices and service .
F	you can '_t even report them to the fsa because they need to be able to give you the " i can '_t do nothing more about it " situation before they '_ll consider looking into it .
M	ordered some beautiful pearls for my wife '_s 00th_birthday on the monday_afternoon .
M	price is exceptional
M	i am starting to wonder seriously if this is a scam .
F	will always purchase from cheapsmells and would highly_recommend to anyone .
M	the quotes came quickly and the system worked_faultlessly .
M	to do this , i needed to remove the rear tilt / support . that went_smoothly .
F	fast and efficent service .
M	the food is superb and not to be_faulted but the company is let_down by an un - reliable delivery partner .
F	the bill arrived last saturday !
M	i must_say however , although the bunch of flowers were lovely and well balanced , i was quite disappointed at the size of the bunch .
F	at one point they even told me they couldn_'_t find my order details .
M	i have bought a lot of things from the store and had good service hence us coming_back for more .
F	daily_sparkle is a good tool for reminiscence and can be engaging , it would be nice to bring it to life more , maybe put grannies old time recipes in for us to make on a weekly_basis .
F	free wifi only worked 0 out of 00 days .
M	hi , i recieved my order and was not to happy that one of the sd_cards was a class0 not the class 00 card i ordered .
F	plenty of options and packages to choose from so could control the sale of our house as i pleased .
F	disappointed as apart_from that they are fine .
M	the biggest complaint - crucial when printing photos - is that the images were printed with insufficient dpi , causing the photo quality to suffer considerably - the images were nowhere_near as ' crisp ' as had been achieved elsewhere .
F	we have been trading for over 00years , professionally and personally i have ordered online .
F	the box is far too_big and full of unecessary paper .
F	they arranged a delivery the next_day that was successful .
F	i wouldn_'_t use any other supplier , i trust lenstore .
M	not impressed .
M	this would have caused us a 0 hour delay for an appointment we had , which we considered to be completely_unacceptable .
M	very impressed with the delivery service and deals on supplements .
M	the product since then has worked beautifully and i '_ve been very impressed .
M	i received my itams and the batterie on one did not work and the atamizers were faulty i have emailed three or four times but did not get a reply and i even rang but waited 00 min but got no reply so very disapointed indeed i will wait and see if i get a reply to this email .
M	caught bus to terminal one .
M	i paid in full in advance so was not best pleased .
F	the last_straw was being told that a refund would take up to 0_weeks to process - this despite the fact that on booking , i was charged immediately .
M	i shopped_around and found feel good contact_lenses to not only be the cheapest in terms or product but also offer free delivery on most orders .
M	i ordered some shorts on 00th_may 0000 which arrived a few_days_later .
M	!
F	after several minutes , the music stopped at the other end of the phone but nobody spoke .
M	for buyers , the paypal experience is generally smooth , unless a buyer has to open a case against a seller who didn_'_t provide a good in the allotted_time and who is refusing to communicate or respond to the paypal claims team .
M	i enjoyed my stay at the premier_inn norwich / showground a00 .
M	then i wouldn_'_t need to shop anywhere_else .
M	jusque - là parcel_force et gls , jamais aucuns problèmes .
F	if items are out of stock then remove them from the on - line page or at_least mark it as " out of stock " it would be good if you could also request your cash rewards on - line as having to spend so much money in a phone_call to get it is not good enough and also the length of time it takes to get is not good .
F	!
F	well_done .
M	?
F	i used this service for the first time today for 0 parcels and it was very easy to do but if i decide to use them again i would not go back to the turbary wine shop in ferndown to drop them off .
M	the computer purchased is for a bicycle ( small and delicate ), making the free_gift useless .
F	i have asked plo to use an_alternate courier and re - despatch as city_link were clearly not making the delivery but i haven_'_t even had a response from the last 0 emails to plo customer_services .
F	easy to order , fast delivery and good pricing .
F	i would never use this company again .
F	told card blocked .
M	im sailing every week from wednesday outbound to friday inbound
M	having been with icuk for several_years we ’ ve experienced first - hand the gradual degradation of the quality of service and network performance of this isp .
F	so after ringing it was explained to me that it didn_'_t matter what name was written as the numbers were all that mattered .
M	there is one word to decribe their service that being excellent .
M	on the plus_side , the item was as_described , well_packed , at a competitive price and , following an initial_hiccup , the communication_regarding the state of my order was good ; on the negative side , they did not have the item in stock , the initial communication could have been a bit more timely and the website has a wrong link .
F	lovely flowers , looked just like they did in the pictures .
M	however regardless of the above and where the fault laid the staff at malpensa were very helpful ( organizing the transfer to linate and adjusting the final invoice to the agreed_amount )
F	they deliver quickly and it '_s always free_postage !
M	laaaang ventetid ved telefonen min .
M	i have posted two reviews on this company .
M	i ’_m an individual who ’_s thorough in his research , have high expectations and a “ right first time ” philosophy .
M	on time , on price and easy .
M	in simple terms i ordered a double_bed almost three_months_ago and they damaged it .
F	gold blend every time .
F	no matter_how i tried , even posting them my receipt and acknowledgement , they just reply chapter & verse a generic_reply of no use nor ownership of the mess up .
F	from placing the order to delivery was 00_hours .
M	all_round positive_experience from_start to finish .
F	i said yes , to cancel them and send the food only , or part - ship the food and send the other items separately when they were back in stock , whichever they thought was best .
M	the order was wrongly despatched as only 0 box was sent and it should have been 0 boxes , as i had paid upfront by debit_card it was down to me to then re contact rajapack to point out the error .
F	i had to collect it from their depot .
F	also the water does not cut_off unless the whole item is placed on an extremely flat base - not always easy in a chicken run !
M	then dont hold your breath for a refund , as there refund policy is way over regulated every item has to be sent to a tech lab for testing 00 to 00 working_days_later you may get a refund , buyer_beware
F	don_'_t touch " first_utility " they have taken 0 payments out of my account after i canceled it in febuary , i have been on the phone a number of times , waiting for hours , passed from one person to another , i sent an e_- mail , now they have changed their phone number and the message they have put out is said so quickly that it is impossible to make out , please read their ratings , it '_s disgraceful !
M	excellent service .
F	j drew
F	not sure what the story would be if we had missed our flight .
F	there should have been some dosage instructions on the packet .
F	and with in 00_hours we were making our alpine village .
M	delighted with my sideboard once it arrived .
M	it would be beneficial for busuu and it '_s users to concentrate on tackling the grammar issues to improve it '_s service .
M	that process was easy , but actually then booking a hotel and viewing available rates was fiddly .
M	after_speaking with a specialist consultant , he said it was possible my condition was work related but he was non committal in that he would not put his_name to any document saying that .
F	tiles arrived as planned 00_hrs_later - lovely friendly delivery man , amazed to be told , when regaling him with how i came to order them , that if i hadn_'_t liked them when they were delivered he '_d have happily taken them away and got my money refunded .
F	but the website was easy to understand the t &_cs clear and the process very easy .
M	( and he didn_'_t even fit the wrong tyres like another ' national ' tyre company did last_year .)
M	great / modern selection of products , reasonable pricing , and a sound return_policy .
M	had to cancel train_tickets and hotel stay in london of the friday as travelling from newcastle so i could pick_up tickets the next_day .
M	good alround service , will use again if required , first_class !
M	this may not be their fault but as they have not replied to my email , i have no idea .
F	i would definitely use boiler_juice again as it was quick and easy to order online and i saved money .
M	i rang them this time and was told that the technicians were out but someone would call me back within an_hour .
F	staff were friendly and very helpful , listening to our needs and specifications .
M	very good
F	could not get the phone number to ring line " this user not available ".
F	historically , i have been very happy with it .
M	the 0star is due to a reasonable delivery service .
M	awful_awful_awful etc
M	a little disappointing if i '_m honest , i ordered 0 items and rec ' d an email a couple of days_later to say that one of the items was out of stock and that they were expecting further stock in 0 - 0 days .
F	today i called interparcel as we are fed_up with the failed collection and they said i quote ' it is not guaranteed that the driver will quote the ref although we scan these instructions to them ' .
M	i cant_believe_how easy it was to use etyres .
F	the free gift offer of cotton and scissor starter set was a great bonus also !
M	when i ' phoned the branch they had no knowledge of my appointment and had to ' phone me back to comfirm the appointment .
F	love the shoes but experience let_down by the length of time it took to deliver them .
M	we have not been able to contact the company so my recommendation would be to shop elsewhere .
F	he gave_me a diary to complete should it fail again with questions to answer to give a better idea as what was wrong .
M	on arrival at site a number of fence_panels were down between adjoining properties which would enable our dog to wander elsewhere and maybe cause issues .
M	i have never dealt_with this company and i must_say it was a nightmare .
M	having 0 cats fighting on the windowsill , our blinds were looking in a terrible state .
F	i think they should give more info about the on board entertainment and maybe an announcement before the entertainment .
F	supplements easy to find , very good profiles and links given to provide further information .
M	slrhut offered the best price on a canon xa00 , and i am pleased with their delivery and the product , but i experienced something i have never had before - a phone_call shortly_after_placing my online order to upsell other accessories , pay for more speedy delivery etc .
F	when the phones are answered , the service is extremely good .
M	the only way they could have provided me a better service would have been to also supply batteries .
F	you can_trust them for a speedy delivery and
F	it was great to have a convenience meal that i could eat with confidence knowing that it was gf .
M	unfortunately i couldn_'_t send a picture to complain as my girlfriend doesn_'_t have a digital_camera or smart phone .
F	:((((
F	and why does customer_services close at 0pm when people may still be travelling home .
M	i hope all will be corrected within the year as i have credit notes , due to mentioned items returned above , are not able to be refunded due to their returns_policy .
M	paid by credit_card and it did not indicate a problem when i paid .
M	on the 0th day the amount had still not cleared and all records of the transaction had disappeared from my account .
F	if you are looking for great quality flowers at a reasonable_price then serenta is perfect !
F	tried to ring local_depot , as i have done before , only to find local numbers no_longer work and you have to ring one central dairy crest call_centre number .
M	definite_improvement .
M	""" grandson loved it !!
M	!
M	fast delivery !
F	they were delivered two_days_later and were of excellent quality , with instructions and even have grapes on !
M	i complained about this , and they assured me that they would all be updated as ex - demonstrators on their web_site .
F	it was only on ringing her at 0 . 00pm that i discovered she hadn_'_t received her flowers yet .
M	they may go on to bloom and be lovely but currently i feel i ' d have been better picking a bouquet from a local_supermarket which would have provided more flowers , better presentation and probably have been cheaper .
M	i contacted the crescent electronic again to get things sorted .
F	i was told my flowers would be delivered between 0 - 0 at 0 : 00 they rang me saying they didn_'_t have my flowers and they had rang around a few shops and they didn_'_t have either so they would make me up a new bunch of flowers didn_'_t say what just a ' nice bunch ' and then they didn_'_t arrive until 0 & 0 / 0 hours_later . the next time didn_'_t get any phone_calls was waiting all day ordered thursday to come friday they didn_'_t come until the next_day at 00am i recomend if you want what u order and on time go elsewhere as theses are not a reliable company as this is the second time its happened to me now .
M	was told that there was no way that my iphone could be unlocked by a certain telecoms company ; looked at this site and was suspicious although site looks professional and theres a phone number with contact address .
F	the clothes in my opinion can be a hit or miss and some items intended to look expensive are just tacky but have an extra £_00 added on .
F	he also said that the policy is for people to pay for their drinks at the bar or leave their credit / debit_card behind the bar incase " people did a runner " our point was that we were waiting for a table and wanted 0 bill .
M	i experienced a lot of difficulty in trying to make this booking , so employed the help of my son , who is something of an expert with all things it .
M	equally , delivery at a time of my choosing didn_'_t incur the additional_costs that one would normally associate with this service .
F	what a surprise when my toothbrush_heads arrived on june 00st , 00 days after_placing the order not the 0 - 0_days promised .
M	ordered the flowers just fine but that '_s when it all went wrong .
M	i opted to wait .
M	recommended .
F	i am self_employed , so i lost two and a half days pay for their mistake which they eventually admitted !
F	a short while later i went back onto live_chat to find out if they meant my order would be delivered that day or if they meant it would be delivered on a different day .
M	have used before and will use again .
M	i have used this company on numerous_occasions but with the service and staff attitude will not use them again .
F	good products very good prices and fast delivery
M	update_: i have just read the response to my review from tech000 .
M	he has no right to speak to my daughter like this , silly man when she had 0 , 000 in her pocket !!
F	i '_m still_waiting for the chocolates but remain hopeful they will turn_up for valentines_day in good condition .
M	the village name and last 0 characters of the post_code had been omitted .
M	i was offered many alternatives and ended_up with a better television .
F	ps monty python were also amazing !
F	quick response & payment .
M	thanks !
F	so , my husband took a day '_s holiday from work .
M	i don_'_t like to arrive at a rental counter and be told that they do not have the specific car model i intended to borrow .
M	booked specific tyres (£_000 worth ) via the website on saturday , for fitting the following saturday .
M	delivered very quickly and called to confirm beforehand .
M	will use again .
M	i will take this matter with relevant_department so this company can pay me for causing me massive inconvenience !
M	0 ) white filler very visible at regular_intervals on oak bed_frame , a large_chunk of wood missing and a split .
M	delivery was very quick too .
M	it got to 00 . 00 , no delivery and i was very sure the item wasn_'_t on the van and headed again to the depot .
F	a very big thank_you .
M	i have never used such a big lense before , and even had to borrow a tripod while i had it , even_though some super mortals on the internet say they can hand hold this lense , well , maybe for one or two shots , but certainly not for all day jaunts .
M	i have 0 pairs of ecco_shoes that i like very much .
M	i did like the fact that ordering was easy and simple and they offer all this free extras .
F	i wouldn_'_t mind but i paid 0 grand for it could have been well on my way to a new one with that .
F	received very quickly this was well_packaged and great quality .
F	ps .
M	all_round excellent service , and i '_ll definitely use them again .
F	got to wait in again tomorrow !!
F	i think they are something to do with the quotes but i '_d be guessing .
M	only one thing i could_find wrong but wouldn_'_t stop me ordering or recommending them , i have found cheaper products with the same ingredients .
M	nonetheless , i made my order via the worktop_express website because it was easier to use than ebay .
M	just acceptable draft printing don_'_t think i would use them again
M	they cancelled my direct debt which they said was due to technical problems did not advise of any_problems until getting a letter asking for payment .
M	very unhappy that a company refuses refunds
M	i went into using gumtree as a seller with my eyes_open as i had heard some pretty awful stories .
M	thank_you .
F	good site to skim over to get a brief idea of places , restaurants and things to do but a lot of reviews on there aren_'_t great or true to the place in my experience !
F	all he did was put me back to the switchboard where i waited another 00mins and i then got somebody_else who although more pleasant could not access my account either .
F	opodo is an easy to use and informative site which saves you time when looking for flights , in europe or world wide .
M	when my order arrived it was dirty full of scratches and was very worn .
M	what i particularly_liked was that although it was a 0 day hire , it was a full 0 days in my possession . delivery timescales for receiving and sending back didnt count towards those 0 days .
M	i ordered the cross my heart - grandissimo flower_arrangement for my wife on our 00th_wedding_anniversary .
F	just warn but so far so good .
F	groupon far_superior
F	i tried this coffee as the regular coffee for my nespresso_machine was becoming very expensive .
F	i was looking for a next_day delivery service so searched on google .
M	the service they give is exceptional
F	my dress arrived defective & the customer service phone line 00000000000 has_been busy all day .
M	my wife then spent 00minutes on their 0000 phone being passed through their service centre escalation chain .
F	the website is excellent , and this is how i discovered fish_oil .
M	overall prices are higher then competitors .
M	i mainly bet on football and horse_racing and just about every market i need is on there .
M	needs to be supplied with stand - off brackets for the rad .
M	i pointed_out the problems i had found with the car , ie , exhaust need replacing and wing_mirror damaged .
F	poor communication , poor resolution .
M	in addition they were offering a one off further discount if you entered a promotional_code .
M	as a result , they cannot ( or at_least have been incompetent in doing so ) quickly and responsively regulate the amount of bandwidth available to their subscription base .
F	wish more companies were this efficient !
M	recommended .
F	great strong bags - especially the ones with apples on them - bring more please !
F	( flowers went to boss '_s wife - hugely embarrassing !!!)
M	this was the same on all 0 pc '_s in my house and my mobile_phone over wifi .
F	the time it took to process and deliver was also extremely good probably the quickest service so far .
M	ordered a couple of sacks of megazorb and they were with me within two_days .
M	my local_store is cheam which i '_ve visited before but great experience with tom from newcastle and actually buying the guitar from glasgow so impressive that this service carried through all sites .
M	sent my voucher in ' recorded delivery '.
M	i booked my delivery and got the parcel posted straight_away .
F	00 to return them to sweden .
M	my colleagues at work found it funny but i didnt .
F	they seem to have something for everyone in the family , and at various , reasonable_prices .
F	delivery is something that always puts me off internet_shopping .
M	many telephone_calls and emails just resulted_in apologies and empty_promises on their behalf .
M	i '_ll be back !
M	excellent service
F	a good place to start in the world of vaping .
M	but before i sent it i received one pair of glasses ??
M	phones answered quickly and politely .
F	paid out ok , but not convinced they are entirely trustworthy , had a better experience with zapper !
F	as the tins were quite_expensive , this negates the lower viovet price .
M	a word of caution to the unweary , these worktops are the real deal .
M	i apologise for the delay in getting back to you .
F	order system not clear .
M	tyres_fitted on friday and having to take back next week to have balancing redone , also had to go back as fitter left my centre cap of , these are about 00 quid and it was lucky i checked before i left the garage as i have been caught like this before
F	i was recommended this site by an instructor at the gym i go to .
M	website has no phone number to contact , email gets an auto response .
F	phoned for advice and decided to make a booking there and then - now looking_forward to our break !
F	they did reply to my emails , but didnt ever answer my query or try and help me .
M	the taps i ordered were well_packaged .
F	purchased ink nido biker_jacket size 00 which was available on the site .
M	i logged in and got the price for my iphone , and within a couple of days had recieved a letter containing instructions of how to send .
M	service was excellent and delivery was very quick .
F	every_step of purchase was straightforward from showroom to delivery .
M	thanks for the beer money
M	customer code 00000 00 - 00 - 0000
M	i was with tiscali before they became talk_talk .
M	ordered on 00th_april , delivered on 00th_may .
M	so i can '_t comment on after sales customer service .
M	this was a replica of the previous order where they were keen to identify exactly_what product is most suitable .
M	i opted for the phil jones aad000 cub .
M	it is very efficient and very good prices for the mobiles when i '_ve wanted to sell .
M	received my order after 0 working_days no_problems at all .
M	they ignore emails .
F	there should be more loyalty after 0 years if payments are made on time and no_issues .
M	i . e .
F	i love licorice and it '_s become my fave , but it is a bit . erm . insipid . still i am still off the fags !
M	the pc arrived approximately 0_weeks after_placing the order .
F	also i do not want to received constant_emails about your happy team and would i like to chat with them , if i want a chat i will phone a friend .
M	terrible service and disgusting staff
M	i called them to place the order as i wasn_'_t quite sure what i needed .
M	trustworthy site , would defo_use again
M	the samples we asked for by a set deadline were missed but we were again reassured the order in full would be ready for a press conference to be screened on live tv .
F	i have a faulty tap and no_doubt i will get nowhere with that !
F	delighted with the service provided and the new machine which is amazing as its got a large drum and does a quick wash at 00 ' in only 00_mins :-) i am a very happy customer .
M	“
F	now , i found out the next_day that the call had in fact cost me £_00 !
M	yeah till you see all the extras you get charged for !
M	worst , they ' re times one rep will tell you one thing while 0 other reps tell you 0 totally different things , leaving you not knowing which is correct .
F	if you want to check in on - line so you can reserve your seats it costs ( i think ) £ 0 . 00 per_person each way .
M	i would have actually paid for the little usage i did have if the didn_'_t put the phone down on me when i tried to cancel .
F	would definitely use again and highly_recommend to others .
M	htc_desire nice phone but why oh why did they allocate such a small internal memory .
M	ordered 0 pairs of glasses , one yves saint laurent , for £_00 . 00 !!
M	it lead to disappointment .
F	i had to post my dvds that i was selling to them , they sent me a credit voucher and then i ordered t he goods i wanted and have had to print_off and send them their voucher in the post !
F	it should be clearer on the website - i eas expecting specs in 00 working_days of ordering them , why does it take so long ?
M	placed an order on the 00st of october , still_waiting for my stuff despite qualifying for next_day delivery .
M	however quite often a collected parcel arrives wit no tracking evidence that it has even been collected , sent to my depot or even loaded_onto a van !
M	the ba flight was somewhat better_than qantas but some miles from emirates .
M	you can tell that they put hardly_any effort into the work , for example , the box was completely ripped on the side .
M	- i missed a dinner with my girlfriend '_s family
M	all good
M	items generally turn_up when expected , sometimes a bit bashed though and their own delivery drives can be a bit moody .
M	very pleased with your service , ram working well , tks
F	all i have to do is say yes and we know we ' re getting the best deal .
F	i was relieved to find that iflorist was still accepting orders for flowers the saturday before mother '_s day - one of the very few .
M	hired a mercedes e_- class - for a special_occasion - good that it was a 00 plate - 0 areas of damage worthy of note not so good - car had been given a quick wash down and water drying marks were still evident - wheels had been given a quick wash over and were left dirty in all the nooks and crannies - tyres were left dirty .
M	pawel our local delivery driver is polite , efficient and cheerful which gives a human side to the delivery service .
F	i order periodically but always happy with partyrama .
M	ordered at 0 , 00 on a saturday_night , delivery was on the following_day .
M	excellent web_site which allows you to design the sign to suit .
M	the whole_experience has_been fantastic , from the updates while the ring was being made to the presentation when it arrived .
F	i like that the delivery company they use gives you an_hour_slot they will be arriving in .
F	was not worth the money , and has put me of ordering again :(
F	when i asked to change the delivery address i got a response quick enough that i couldn_'_t as frustrate as i was about that !
M	all i want is to be able to return the faulty goods iv been delivered , and i should at_least get back half the cash for the chasis
F	i made a mistake and ordered the wrong coat , and received a reply immediately to my exchange request .
F	was upsold to have the anti_- bac £_00 .
F	i made my first order last_week , prices were very competitive and delivery was very fast .
M	what a hassle_free experience .
M	!
F	he told my husband that it was too late to deposit cash in for immediate clearance , plus banks were nearly shut ( in his defence , correct ) but that he personally was in at 0 am the next_day , and would do his best to sort it out .
F	happy bl_** dy anniversary !
F	thanks for ruining my boyfriend '_s birthday .
M	i would also like to add that trying to claim a refund is just as bad .
M	i always order from them !!
F	have tried both these formats over the course of 0_days and . nothing !
F	robert offered us a choice of products of different costs and made sure that he matched the right product to our needs .
M	a week after the estimate delivery ( which was already 0_weeks ) i contacted the company and this is where the disappointment begins .
F	the artisan_naturals mattress i bought is blissfully comfortable and top quality .
M	it would appear that products recommended on training_courses don_'_t seem to be fully briefed to shop staff and that those products don_'_t seem to be fully available .
F	hardly_any waiting time .
F	i chose to allow the florist to make the selection - there was no room for instruction as to colour but i did request a large bouquet .
F	asked to be near amminties .
F	my experience with plumbnation has really put me off online shopping .
M	i insisted on speaking to a manager and one wasn_'_t available .
F	if the follow_up feature mentions that customers also cannot trust you to deliver their order it will make customers think_twice about using your company .
F	can '_t even get through to speak to anyone to complain .
M	i found the operator rude , unhelpful and condescending .
F	the balloons were also very small .
M	i printed out the requested info ; the courier called the next_day .
F	not good on veggie food .
F	i '_ve had 0 000 orders now and product wise no_probs .
M	good prices and fast delivery
M	i do not want the tickets !
M	monster change your delivery courier to one that does what it says it will .
M	argos have lost plot on customer service .
M	i use shopto a lot primarily_because the next_day delivery is so reliable no matter what time i shop .
F	because it was a wig i couldnt return it .
M	after repeated_emails nagging me to re - order i did so , and after the order was placed i went back and looked at my original order and realised i had paid almost twice the price the second time round .
F	the site said my two phones were worth £_00 .
M	pleased with every_aspect of ordering from webtogs .
M	good products , well_packaged and secure , good aftersales . first_class
M	otherwise result o . k .
M	a site that has good quality images and as something very important for shoppers , it is clearly_laid_out with a simple and straight_forward process to select your item and size .
M	two_days_later i was told they couldn_'_t give my the set price as my phone had got water_damage !!!!!!
F	the message read : ups have tried to deliver your ticket ( s ) but have not been able to do so after 0 delivery attempts .
F	it was excellently_packaged and the communication i received was brilliant .
F	fingers_crossed they give me my refund very soon .
M	absolutely_useless !
M	don_'_t bother .
F	my mum said i should complain as there were two flower_heads broken off and the flowers were in poor condition .
M	told it was a warehouse error .
F	i have a front_door !!!!!!!!
F	found exactly the right one on ebay and carpetrrunners - quick delivery and as_described completely .
F	the delivery of my order was excellent , the order itself was disappointing as it did not do what i expected it do and i had to buy an extra part .
F	the soft chocolate_bar and fruit soft bar are yummy .
F	at about 00_quid cheaper_than the rrp i didnt know if this was too good to be true , but my sunglasses arrived quickly and are 000_% the genuine_article .
F	i look_forward to receiving their magazines and do not buy my art material from any other source .
F	not good as this has cost me £ 0 . 00 so far so not very happy at the moment .
M	having said that , when i did speak to them , they were courteous and apologetic and i did eventually get a refund so i cannot give them a very low rating , but beware , if you have problems with your original order , expect a long wait to get it sorted .
M	i had no notification that it would be late .
M	easy to use web_site with user_friendly facilities and range of choices .
F	however , after_speaking to the finance company , barclay '_s , we now know that this was also a lie .
M	the agent at city_link was however very professional and courteous .
M	no emails , no other contact and they don_'_t ( i hope ) have any bank details for me !
M	would i buy from then again - yes ,
F	my vets are the best - animed is the best support for prescritions and general medicine in uk .
F	the first day went by and i had ' nt looked for a real smoke so i kept going and here i am 0_months on and feeling great with no withdrawal or anxeity .
F	however it is attractive so money not entirely wasted .
F	on both_occasions the recipient reported being at home during the day but not aware of delivery .
M	i had problems printing the necessary labels for a parcel and had the good fortune to be put in contact with a girl called leanne .
F	cheap , tasty powder .
F	and why display products on your website with a full description etc etc - only to have a note at the bottom saying ' discontinued by manufacturer '??
F	they say ' good availability ' on selected seats but they are mysteriously ' sold out ' when you phone and then they quote a much higher price ( almost_double ).
M	expected delivery within 0 - 0 days .
F	he patiently_answered questions , made some good suggestions and came up with a very competitive quote .
M	to cap it all , they ' re jolly nice people !
F	luckily both the people who received the parcels were understanding , helpful and honest .
M	not the best .
M	a huge disappointment and inconvenience for me and the 0 friends and work_colleagues i had invited to the concert .
F	hightly recommend this service !
M	i will also be recommending you to my friends .
F	i will update all events on this site !!
M	i don_'_t recommend halfords_autocentre at all !!
F	probably would have been ok if they were give to someone but they were sent to a funeral home so i feel they could have been better done .
M	very happy with dealings with this company .
M	the delivery was left_outside my back door and a calling_card posted throught the front_door letter_box .
M	thanks again
F	i got through to serenata and spoke to several different people who said my details would be passed to the customer service team who would call me back as they were unable to transfer calls to that department from their phones .
F	the website was good and i was pleased with the service .
M	once i got to gran_canaria i was told i have to buy an insurance for 00 € or i pay them 000 € just in case something happens as deposit , 000 € is ridiculous anyway .
M	i obviously ordered a pair of hinges at the wrong time of year , it being christmas .
M	booked car for our trip to be collected at cape_town airport , collected car & drove to hotel .
F	now we can not get our refund as it is apparently too difficult to give the refund for orders ordered online !!!
M	if this is going to be the ongoing length of transfer then we will need to think again and possibly go back to the taxi or a hire car despite the extra_cost .
F	easy system .
F	i ordered a banner for my son '_s leaving party .
F	i have called several_times to be informed that refunds take 0 - 0_days , so why 00 days late am i still_waiting ?
M	thanks for wasting half an_hour of my time to stand outside in the rain and cold - when i had neither the time nor inclination so late in the evening to spare for it .
M	easy , great service .
F	delivery drivers were great .
F	in fact i have re - booked to visit the tour but will make my own way there and back as i will get all the time i need and it works out much_cheaper .
F	annoying .
F	so , kids .
F	it was apparently processed on the 00th but im yet to see it !
F	one of the most useless internet based companies i '_ve ever_encountered .
M	the young_lady was very polite and knowledgeable , gave the appropriate advice and took my order .
F	the flowers were also not as colourful as online .
M	all gifts were delivered promptly with no_fuss or bother what more could i ask for
M	i ' d have no_qualms whatsoever recommending them to anyone .
M	changing the car was not a problem other than we lost half a day taking the car back to cape_town airport .
F	hi iwas paying £_00 . 00 broardband and calls + line rental just got everything with talk_talk for £_00 . 00 for 00 month no limits check it out great saving great service
M	button_cells and of course aa , aaa and d cell .
F	surely that makes the most sense .
F	thanks for the service and quality of your products
M	i was disapointed to receive only part of my order , with no explanation that only part of the order was being delivered or when the remainder would be expected i understand that payment has_been taken for the whole order .
M	they said it was an i . t .
F	having said all that , when i sent the capsules back with their free_postage_label ( which is great ) i was sent my full_refund straight_away .
M	i ordered a game , but had no email from moby_memory ( ext ref removed ) either to confirm the order , or to say it had been despatched .
M	mr tong
M	from the minute i click send , i have no doubt that my order will be shipped in an expeditious manner .
F	i have no such problem with sainsbury and ocado .
M	i was charged in the region of €_000 for the two tickets and was under the impression that their face value was in the region of € 00 each .
F	i placed an order for 0 sets of flowers to be delivered to 0 separate addresses and they stayed in all day and nothing has shown up , not even an_email to say will be delivered at a later date nothing would not recommend
F	today they emailed to say that they have raised a query with yodel which will take 0 working_days to process .
M	best regards
F	i would use this store again without a doubt and would recommend to others to do so too .
M	this site might be ok if you ' re happy to wait up to a month for delivery as the price is good , but the service is lousy .
F	would happily use them to book our holiday .
F	having sold some things on ebay i thought that would try to send one of them by collect_+.
M	will buy from again !
M	they used to be very good , but i can only think internally they are now in chaos .
F	not good !
F	additionally neither will house numbers help . as they jump from 00 - to - 00 i had a moment of anxiety that i '_d booked a scammers b_& b !
F	i send parcels to my sister in italy frequently .
F	after_speaking to inghams twice , once on the phone and once via social_media , i '_ve basically been told tough .
M	the instructions did make clear the need to get this right but getting someone_else to make the judgement millimetre prefect is i think unrealistic
M	i found the service given by furniture @ work to be very good .
M	many_thanks ,
F	given that they were large pieces of furniture i expected a call or an update to the position .
F	i purchased the miss amazing handbag deal through wowcher at the beginning of february .
M	actually the guys said it was an easy fix but it required the two bt companies supplying us talking to each other .
F	you are certainly going to be added to my " favourites " many_thanks .
F	steve , don_'_t know your surname but you were my hero .
F	wont use again .!
M	however , in comparing different sites and different companies , i believe that supplementwarehouse is the most upfront , direct , and truthful company when it comes down to pricing and their service towards making_sure you get what you are looking for at the price you want it .
M	if you are not a few quids short , do not buy from this company , especially you are buying for a production environment .
M	sadly this soured an otherwise pleasant_experience .
M	spoke to the company providing the taxi on behalf of resorthoppa only to be told they stopped doing_business with resorthoppa 0 months_ago yet resorthoppa took money out of my account 0 days ago .
M	we also had a stealth charge made for the " convenience " of paying in our own currency - again , this was not requested and we were not notified of this ( if we were , we would have declined as our credit_card is free for international_payments ).
F	had to go away - fitter found a hole in bottom of shower_cubicle box when he lifted it off the pallet with glass pieces trickling out - photographed it and rang and to ask about returning easy plumb tray - told to ring back monday - went through rigmoroll again and eventually the following friday another cubicle delivered .
M	other than what is stated in the title i think the site and company provides great marketing to it customers and gives them great deals on products needed for those who are trying to get into a better shape then they were .
M	there is nothing to go_wrong when this kind of service is attending your order and i shall unfailingly shop_here again in the future .
F	!
M	he could not explain_why if that was the case , there was no note left through the door .
M	what was once a 0_star offer is now reduced to a middle of the road one .
F	and to go out of my way to send them back the wrong item by next_day delivery ( otherwise no refund !)
F	even when breaking them up , i found them dry and hard to get down , even choking on them a few_times , now i feel like i don_'_t want to take anymore :-(
M	bought two oxford basin_taps and waste outlet very pleased with , found plug a bit_tight to get out maybe it will get easier with use
F	when i rung the customer_services , i was basically told tough_luck that i had to work and that i didn_'_t know anyone who didn_'_t work who could sit in all day .
M	it '_s a comfy office_chair which matches the good '_s description .
F	i have enjoyed thus_far a warm and friendly approach from a customer_orientated company .
M	pas_de problèmes avec gamola , bon produits …
F	you can always guarantee that your order eill be delivered instantly .
F	so the british_corner_shop is a great service , prompt and efficient .
M	so_far all ways delivered on time , undamaged , and cheaper_than royal_mail .
F	thank_you .
M	it has_been a touch disappointing , despite the positive customer service .
M	after chatting with a guy called kapur he closed the chat instead of replying me so i started the chat again and a guy called lee got my number to call me .
F	luckily i didn_'_t have to wait long and the same day my voucher came through i received an_email from glasses_direct saying they had a 00_%_off frames offer .
M	i wanted to put up some small floating shelves in our living_room and all the major_diy " players " didn_'_t have what i wanted .
M	including kkarparks ltd . more car parking .
M	have still received nothing .
F	i was surprised when the throw arrived sooner_than_expected and beautifully_packaged .
F	i questioned_why no effort had been made to contact me - i was told they were getting round to it ( group e_- mail ?).
F	to make_matters worse i had a burst water pipe from the bathroom which flooded my dining_room .
F	they wanted pictures anyway so an_email is the only way i could do that quickly .
F	it is fabulous for drying in limited_space and very quick to pack away after use .
F	original offer £_000 and new offer £_00 .
F	i see no point in offering a next_day delivery if u are not going to honour it .
M	steve .
F	driver was quite rude and abrupt !
F	i have sorted further invitations out but will now look for someone that doesn_'_t use yodel .
M	when complained and asked or a refund was given a refund only for the card not delivered and that was then end of it .
F	cannot rely_on getting the medication you need on time but this is not the companies fault , just the courier company they chose to use .
M	goods just as expected , nothing to fault .
F	i will look here first whenever i purchase anything again .
F	i was a bit_sceptical at first , thinking the price was too good to be true so was not expecting much but thought it was worth a punt at that price .
M	i perhaps wrongly , assumed the number_plate recognition allowed_me to go straight to the barrier when leaving the car_park and insert my ticket with my reg_number on it .
M	excellent delivery was kept in the loop_throughout will regular email mails , texts and even a call on the day , was also supplied with delivery man '_s name and mobile number if i wanted to call him .
M	you have also failed to address the fact that the you emailed me the article had been dispatched on the 0rd of january and then a follow_up email on the 0th to say an error had been made and it had not been sent and was again out of stock .
F	it couldn_'_t have been easier to use anyvan .
M	and this should be explained_clearly in the package page and also they should not take the payment until the final step .
M	and like last time , it was delivered early on the day specified - within two says this time , last time the day after .
F	i needed to order a bottle of primrose evening oil as my dog has really itchy_skin and this had been recommended .
F	i '_m a bit disappointed as really had high_hopes for these as an_alternative to nespresso .
F	we feel they should protect their customers , not leave them feeling duped .
F	we ordered this item and it was promptly delivered , however whilst construction was not difficult the instructions in a foreign_language did not help .
F	i recommended but the person coukdnt get discount either as same ( average ) prescription .
M	have you ever come_across a website that not only looks as though it was created 00 years_ago but also works like it ?
F	ordered late on monday and delivered before 0am on the wednesday .
M	i pre_- ordered a generous xbox one launch pack from them back in july .
F	extremely pleased with the level of detail paid prior to my order being confirmed .
F	their prices are really competative .
F	the prescription was the same as was everything else but this time they are not as good or as comfortable .
F	so what originally looked like costing us around £_00 cost us over_£_000 .
M	i highly_recommend the guys at tsohost if you want great hosting at great value .
M	this company is the worst to be experienced since a long time :
M	this was completely_unacceptable to me and the guitar was more like a second_hand instrument .
M	# 0 - 00 hanhai building
F	i had given them the right number , they had mistaken the pre printed bracket on their forms as a number 0 .
F	somehow i ended_up paying twice after having bought and entered my voucher_code with printerpix .
F	i will not be shopping in this place again !
F	i have had a wooden watch since christmas and wore it daily , until my sister '_s dog ate it , my having left it on the night - stand at her home .
M	the courier was terrible , told me he came to my address to deliver .
M	i can highly_recomend toolstop .
M	it was also very dangerous as i could easily have got crushed under the 000 kg wardrobe if it was to fall over on top of me .
M	not even once .
F	shame , the bags were good .
M	eventually called me back 0 days_later - when i said the price offered it was a bit low , never_heard back .
M	it was sent by royal_mail and the can was perfect .
M	i just don_'_t feel like i had a very good experience as a customer so i thought i ' d mention it .
M	several companies contacted myself within minutes , with one making an appointment .
M	was a bit disappointed as i sent you 0 i phone 0 '_s and on the internet you only asked if the phones worked which they both did , but one had a crack on the screen and you reduced your offer to £_00 i think it is an insult , if you had asked if the phones were damaged i would have said about the crack but you don_'_t
M	really professional service from_start to finish , if you want a van , go swiss !
M	make of it what you will but to me i can '_t really give them the benefit of the doubt that there isn_'_t something sinister here .
M	the flowers were of a good standard but the box they came in was half open .
M	couldn_'_t ask for more !
M	when ordering before i have had my products arrive within two_days ,
F	my first time using ths garage .
F	think that a non zipped hoodie in a medium would '_ve been a bit awkward to get on and off , especially if your boobs are big - mine are not !
F	make frequent orders & never had a problem .
F	ordered my barbour_jacket and received it two_days_later , all packaged up in a lovely box .

F	quality of goods was excellent , as was the choice .
M	not sure what / why it happened , but it shouldn_'_t have .
F	the contact_lenses are much_cheaper_than my optician '_s and the service and delivery is excellent .
M	good quality product which arrived on time .
M	000_% recommended to use hostelbookers instead of hostelworld !
F	later in the day , the delivery was made so the information i was given was incorrect anyway .
M	my gripe came when enquiring when this would be back in stock or ordered from the supplier - they seem to have little or no inventory_management , or at_least the customer_support_team aren_'_t communicated this information by the purchasing department , so it left me completely in the dark as to when i would get my order .
M	product is excellent , extak delivered quickly .
F	this lady was unprofessional , vindictive and i would have thought with the amount of time i complained that her manager would have pulled her up on what was happening and at_least spoken to me once .
F	have used this company before and as last time goods as_described and delivery when expected .
M	ok , this was my mistake .
M	there was no card as they obviously aint tried to deliver rather had it on the wagon , it got late so they returned to depot .
M	hof offered no solutions to this on the phone or by email .
M	very pleased with quick delivery , and lights are good quality as well . bought some previously on e_- bay from china and they were a death trap 000volt and loose wires .
M	no place to wait for your car , people were standing in the rain .
F	will_definatley shop_here again .
F	0 .
M	offer of free insurance is a waste of time so if its a valuable shipment you should get additional cover .

F	!
M	none of them have been large but i am now starting to question whether it is worth completing large pruchases with quidco if it is 00 / 00 as to whether the cashback will be paid .
F	the food was rubbish and we didnt get all we paid for .
M	after the email with the link failed to reach them for some reason ( which may have been mine ) i had to verbally supply the details , which i could have done in the first place .
M	they accepted it was defective by e_- mail after i sent photographs and said they would replace .
M	fantastic service next_day delivery perfect will be using viovet often thanks very much
F	i booked a flight online with e . bookers for the first time and it was £_00 cheaper_than booking direct with british_airways on line so i thought that was quite a good deal .

M	emailed customer_services who failed to get back to me for 0 days .
F	great service , very quick , bought on wednesday_night and they came on saturday_morning !
M	considering that i had not seen the vehicle until the day i purchased it i think that jennings_ford offer honestly and good value .
F	received no confirmation by email so emailed and telephoned constantly all day saturday before we left uk to go on holiday as it claims customer_services is open 0 - 0 . 00 mon - sat with but received no replys .
F	i should not be the purchaser that spots that wrong meds have been dispatched but the dispenser and another person at the company to check .
M	i was looking for a new car and came_accross thecarwow site .
F	delivery came when we had really bad rain .
F	ordered some games but had to pay first then send off credit_note after delivery received .
M	the product was as_described and of good quality and standard and at a competitive price .

M	there is no system in place , whereby i can leave extra details with hdnl about leaving it with a neighbour or in a safe_place !
F	when making my order i selected the option to choose the day of delivery ( costing more ) as i wanted to know that i '_d be in .
F	no .
F	good , easy to use , website for browsing & ordering .
F	they seem to completely disregard consumer_rights and make rules up as they go along .
M	i received a phone_call the night before to tell me to expect the delivery along with a tracking_number .
F	all of the above is my own opinion of my experience with the rug_house .
M	you won_’_t answer either phone now but your voice_message says you will respond in 0 hours to emails but i haven ’_t had any response since 00 : 00 ?
M	we were left high and dry and ended_up an_hour of messing_about having to sort our own transport out which funnily_enough was cheaper_than what resorthoppa was charging for the same service .
F	easy to use website good value excellent communications
M	then they can suddenly ( nearly ) meet my original quoted price .
M	however the catches seem to be really flimsy and difficult to operate as they don_'_t seem to hold .
M	i also like free_postage !!
M	but there '_s not much money to be made from cds .
M	avoid !!
M	surprisingly , some things can work fine in this country .

F	dont buy from this company flowers are nothing like advertised on website totally disappointed might as well of gone and picked some weeds out of back garden .
M	all this i would expect as its automated .

M	0000000
M	had to reschedule times , all done without_fuss .
M	i called cancellations before the 0 day period and was assured i '_m not being charged for the tv and phone and that he would do whatever in the system to ensure i '_m not charged more than i '_m currently paying .
F	the item arrived a day late as it missed her_birthday and she thought that i had forgotten it was not a good start , if you had let_me know then i could have told her to expect something the next_day .
M	what more to say other than give them a go to see for yourself !
F	was trying to de - clutter my home and make some money at the same time so decided to sell my iphone 0 which had been sitting in the cupboard for over a year . bingo !
F	i handed the phone back .
M	in my opinion the offer was not honest .
M	when i pointed_out that their order acknowledgement confirmed what i had said they agreed that , perhaps , it was their system that was at fault after all .

M	goods arrived promptly and as_described - happy to use again
F	i was very pleased with the products and will definitely use this company again .
F	informed guy has just left with paperwork and be with me in 00mins .
F	i placed an order and all looked good .
F	environ_products just what i was looking for .
M	i ordered 0 pairs of the same style glasses with different_colour lenses , when i recieved my order one pair was clear lenses and not tinted as i had ordered . i have now returned the faulty pair and m hoping they will manage to supply me with the correct lenses this time . not very impressed . but they were helpful when i phoned .
M	competitive_prices and excellent service is the reason i always use event_tyres - highly_recommended .
M	they called me after i placed my order to say that some of the laptops they send out are faulty , and without paying a £_00 inspection charge , they would refuse to cover any faults such as pixel loss , which is not deemed as a fault . on a brand_new laptop ?!?!?
F	i spent over_£_000 with tile_mountain ordering everything from tiles , beads , adhesive and grey grout for my bathroom .
M	the process was very quick and efficient including payment of funds .
M	arrived next_day has said but was badly_damaged and high_gloss laquear was full of bits and dust .
F	i received a bunch of flowers and a box of chocolates from a friend .
M	they have taken the money from my credit_card account but so_far i have received nothing .
M	the way the furniture is packaged with the base of the wardrobe together with the main part means that the delivery staff cannot lift it due to the excess weight .
F	train your staff !
F	the bed was supposed to be delivered before 0o /_c .
M	just shame about the customer service , wasnt very helpful when telling_me what the problem was and wanting to do everything by email instead of the phone .
M	people have not returned calls and it is almost_impossible to get through on the phone !
F	ordered and delivered the next_day .
F	the website was really tricky and over complicated .
M	we got a very good price on our wellies , and paid for the next_day delivery which was actually very good value .
F	customer service is excellent if needed .
F	the outfits were great , morphsuits and they were much_thicker material than i expected .
F	excellent service .
F	yes ?
F	pity the service wasnt the same .
M	booked 0 trips through viator but had contrasting experiences . canyon trip : late being picked_up from hotel , not very informative during flight and bus trip , requested gluten_free lunch for wife and son , these were not supplied . almost directed onto wrong bus for journey back to hotel .
F	i was very disappointed eecially as i had to pay £ 0 .
F	they came in a sturdy_box with bubble_wrap , but , unfortunately , one of them has_been damaged --- it is creased and i am not prepared to use it .
F	the box was soaking_wet from the rain but luckily the boots were not damaged !
F	i was totally impressed , best selection , best prices , easy purchase and i loved that i was told when the flowers had actually been delivered .
F	!
M	thanlfully we did not need to make any claim so i am unable to comment on the claims_procedure .
M	terrible
M	i will not be using them again and i will ensure that i make other people aware that customer service was very poor .
F	we are still_waiting for our mattress !
F	the rose basket was very impressive and unusual coloured roses and fresh looking flowers were perfect .
F	again , i received no response .
M	i appreciate companies may have teething_problems , but this goes to show that despite one great service first time around ( a delivery to my door within 0 days of order and good communication all along ) it can so quickly be undone , leaving me to remember the poor service .
M	will use again .
F	there is a varied_selection of vitamins & minerals & the only problem is you want so many of them .
M	this was in central_london where delivery is notoriously_difficult .
M	i have paid for tickets many_times with travelup but they have now lost me as a future customer . they charged £ 0000 for a ticket on ba for a premium econ seat ( saying only 0 seats were left ) for a colleague traveling with me , having been assured this was the cheapest available . you can_imagine my shock when after my friend had paid finding on the official site for ba the same seat for £ 0000 . 00 ! this is an example of dishonest profiteering and unacceptable practice by this company . shame on them !
F	they also paid a competitive price for my old_mobile and they kept me updated all the time via emails on the next steps .
F	would recommend to my friends and family excellent value for money and very impressed with the quality if the furniture .
F	as a tutor , i would recommend first_tutors .
F	the transaction went pretty smoothly and i like it that i was informed of the remittance date , so that i don_'_t have to keep checking until then .
M	not the cheapest can buy same quality elsewhere cheaper
F	eg .
F	i still_haven_'_t heard_anything from betterbathrooms regarding this .
M	but they banked my money immediately upon order date . do they really expect me to buy from them again ?
F	however , as far as i could see they did not tell you before paying that you would need to provide evidence to show you are not a fraud .
M	araldite them in permanently in 0 pairs of shoes ( minimum )
F	when i placed the order i filled in the box regarding special instructions .
M	i have also asked hostelworld to contact me twice regarding properties that are really bad or inconstancies with the bill or the hostelworld fee and also about fake pictures on the website , unfortunately i have never got any reply or feedback from hostelworld .
F	the item i ordered was not quite what i got , i asked for bone shaped tablets and i got ordinary round tablets .
F	then funnily_enough paypal wanted to talk again when they lost their money .
M	that aside it is what it is and ebay do the online car boot fair better_than anyone_else !
F	also it was pouring with rain and we got soaked going from meet and greet meeting_point to the terminal even_though the driver dropped us a bit closer .
M	contacted cleverboxes tp obtain a price for a sony hdr - tg0ve camcorder .

F	the company is based in gloucester approx 0 miles from our site and we were last on the list for delivery on one order which was after 0 . oo p . m and the builders had gone home after waiting all day to complete the job !
F	have used before and will use again .
F	pasta and fish dishes were nice .
M	bought wifi for 00_hours and only got an_hour usage due to he wifi going down in just my room .

M	i have used transgloble quite a few_times now and they are so reliable and also cheaper_than the royal_mail and i don_'_t have to que .
M	next_day delivery of the envelope , emails to tell you how your order is progressing and super_fast payment .
M	i think the website is pretty good .
F	on board the thomas_cook plane we did have two seats in a two - seater section however there was no window , just the wall of the plane .
M	you must do it in time
F	marina
F	i was told however by the salesman that the job would take 0 day when in fact it took 0 and this could not be attributed to the fitter .
M	i was in when parcelforce allegedly tried to deliver , did not have a card or receive calls to tell me the item was waiting for me to pick_up , despite parcelforce tracking showing the opposite .
F	serenata definitely did not let us down .
M	unfortunately , i discovered on the following_monday , that nothing had been delivered .
M	the sofa was filthy and consisted of a narrow plank across as a seat which was not only uncomfortable but dangerous as we kept falling down the holes on either side , the only other chair broke the first time it was used , the kitchen was infested with insects ( rep told me that if i cleaned it they should go away - this was in our first day so left like this for us ); and there was a building site across the road and as the pool was in the front_garden it couldn_'_t be used as dust blew across it all day , never mind the noise from drill , men , cars etc .
F	the problem is one blind came complete with everything including instructions but the other one had four screws_missing to attach the brackets and the saftey clip and fittings were missing altogether .
F	the tiles were exactly as depicted and described on the website .
F	the display online looked fabulous and whilst the colour of the flowers were as_described , i was extremely disappointed not to have any lillies in the bouquet , especially as they dominated the picture and therefore ' expected ' them .
F	that driver could have driven one of the other vehicles .
F	we were worried that our car would be damaged and that we would probably miss our flight so we went to the official parking and paid £_00 .
F	after 0 phonecalls to them and several hours of being on the phone between them and my bank there was still aparently no record of m booking whatsoever .
M	he / she instigates tests , scans , mri '_s etc .
F	excellent and courteous service .
M	very misleading and very poor service .
F	well_done bt .
F	!
F	fabulous always get what i want the site is easy to navigate lovely quick check out process and rapid_despatch what more could you possibly want .
F	the next_day came and it still did not arrive !
F	they are completely on the ball and they are a very slick_operation which means for the end user a totally pain_free service .
F	x
M	no_probs glad to have done business with you will use again .
M	do vistit buzz catering site where u will get cheap catering accessories .
M	glasses were very competitively_priced however the lenses are really hard to clean as they are plastic .
F	found the process more complicated than other similar_companies but , from experience , have always had clearer and better quality photos from jessops - at_least for printed photos .
F	so we measure them all , and i go off inside like statto to work out how they can feasibly do a roof and a floor , all the while my heart sinking because , i just know .
M	customer_services chatted some nonsense about product pictures not having to match product descriptions .
M	i use three capsules of " ffc " for a decent large latte whereas i used two nespresso_capsules .
F	use them and you will see why . customer service as it should be 0st_class .
F	it won_'_t accept mine , and correspondence to an anonymous person or computer come_back over and over that ' they have set_up the address ' - they don_'_t acknowledge that when i try to validate it the " next " or " continue " button is greyed out ( even_though i have sent screen prints ) so i can '_t set_up my ad .
F	wish_id looked on here before i signed_up - avoid at all cvost
M	the lightrabbit bulbs are heavy , metal and glass construction and very nice .
M	just not long moved back to vodafone contract after a long , long time on o0
F	!
F	but having finally received the correct item , i '_m happy with the purchase and the quality of the tree .
F	i would really rate diet_chef .
F	and a very good quality wetsuit !
M	i didn_’_t expect any kind of refund on my cancelled parking but donna explained that she would talk to the company and see if their driver had already been dispatched to pick me up .
M	i was well pleased with this transaction the communication was superb , fast delivery and excellent product well_packaged , i will_definitely shop_here again .
M	i went through the order procedure asking to collect in store , but saw that the price to pay was the full_amount .
F	i sold my phone on the 00 . 00 . 00 .
F	we will never order from dell again .
M	great price and easy to book - delighted by the price we got
M	i placed the order online rang through and asked for a time_slot straight and had two tyres_fitted within the hour , could not ask for more .
F	although the job got completed and the staff were individually helpful , the whole_process of repair took too long ( almost 0_weeks ) which i don_'_t find acceptable for a piece of critical office equipment .
M	this was where the problem lied .
F	issues only began when the parcel courier used couldn_'_t deliver on a saturday ( even if i paid_extra ) or after 0pm ( i get home from work around 0 : 00 !).
F	i was not in when the plumber fitted it and it would have cost me a lot of money to ask him to take it off and fit a new one .
M	travel from rotted to amsterdam , i only found out about return bus once i ' d landed by enquiring with ( dutch ) terminal staff .
F	my daughter is getting_married in america and i had no idea how to go about this .
F	i ordered these on line -- they are fantastic - the colours jump out at you -- these were for a lady in another flat that has partial site she can see different_colours -- they are wrapped around her balcony -- she '_s been getting out of bed just to see them glow -- they seem to work straight_away -- now she is trying the different sequents to flash - dance - and others she '_s trying them all -- because the dragonfly are white these show up the different colour bulbs when charged perfect -- very pretty
F	there are lots of reputable florists on line ; serenata are not in the running & they should be ashamed of their service !!
F	i did all my christmas shopping online this year and this remains the only item i have not yet received !
F	the price was very competitive , free_postage and more_importantly it was delivered really quickly .
M	i next paid on my uk visa_card , order accepted again online - no problem , money debited from my card .
M	frankly i ' d have been quicker collecting my order myself .
F	i ordered four items and within less_than a week i received a package .
F	they state on their website the calling time " average pick_up 0 minutes " then you ring and find you can be on there for up to 00_minutes before being answered .
F	i was very disappointed with the results - the photos being very
F	i spoken to member of staff who asked me to take pictures and send them to him , i struggled to do this as my photos were to large , eventually he received them and told me that they would order me a new pair free of charge which was great , but the frames i had were no_longer in stock so i had to search for a new pair .
M	second class deliveries are pretty slow and , i '_ve had one that didn_'_t arrive , so it '_s worth_paying the extra £ 0 for first_class delivery .
M	but it does beg the question as to why santander '_s standard variable rate is 0 . 00_% - that '_s 0 . 00_% above !
F	i ordered my wellies one afternoon about four o ' clock and they arrived the next_day !
F	i have also spent hours emailing or ringing them , to say nothing of not having the use of the item !
F	nothing derogatory , just a simple description of how it wasn_'_t for me , but they never published .
F	thank_you - i will definitely recommend you to my friends & use your company again next time .
F	however , they have been good since and given me an extra £ 0 to order a new bouquet for my mum .
M	mazuma_mobile claims to give you money for your old phone .
M	instead of joining orange :
M	makes me think that the headline prices for the cameras etc are not profitable and they have to make it up with unbranded additional items ( in my case a us battery_charger with no uk adapter supplied - now being corrected ).
M	however i was disappointed not to here from them until friday .
F	when they came they were very small
F	item exactly as_described .
F	i ordered a pushchair and adaptors from sobaby .
M	arrives promptly and well_packaged
F	it was not available to collect from store but had to be delivered with a 0 day delivery schedule .
F	they rang me back first thing the next_morning and that day sent me a new box .
M	as a business i would recommend that no one use carphone_warehouse for business contracts .
F	we ' re still_waiting for a single call to be returned & still have no web builder package .
F	hi very happy with my order fast drlivery will recomend my freinds to shop with you too a very big thank_you
F	easy to find and easy to check in .
M	so 00 days_later still no item , so got in contact .
M	i eventually got through to someone at your customer service but they didn_'_t seem very interested .
F	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to visit when looking for a new machine as they can be expensive purchases and you need to be sure you are buying something compatible with you .
F	i have an account for myself and i recently opened one for a friend to host her website .
F	eventually they came and collected their bins .
F	sandy
F	i purchased the heavy post and rail fencing through b_& q nearly 0 years_ago at a great price , i realised that no corner posts were included so i called jacksons fencing directly and they let_me add some corner posts to my order from b_& q , they didn_'_t charge me any extra for delivery , the customer_care were very helpful .
M	i got no help whatsoever , the desk person was extremely rude , i had to find the man to do the outsize check in and find out where to take the bike afterwards .
M	available to the customer and very secure online .
F	no explanation as to why they couldn_'_t do this was given to me .
F	price very good too !.
F	the website is incapable of accepting incorrect spellings .
F	my wife asked the obvious question why no one had bothered informing us .
F	i expect this update to be ignored as well .
M	i am a real customer
M	will be definitly using again in the near_future .
M	0nd_class post would have been quicker and cheaper .
F	i rang and asked about twist mop i ordered they looked into it told me i had not redeemed voucher or had e_mail saying not gone_through but i told them they had taken postage of £ 0 . 00 & not had e_mail to say not gone_through but they closed it anyway .
M	great price for my hunter_wellies .
M	to many stories of accounts being hacked and monies taken
M	recieved an email requesting confirmation that i still wanted some of the items on back order .
M	does what it say '_s on the title , good service , compatible with my computer , speedy delivery , certain to use again in the future .
M	disappointed with service
M	they messed_up my booking , never told me .
M	i was shocked to find out when we arrived at the airport in rio that the flight we had booked did exist and our booking never happened .
M	however , if my old phone was in a better condition ( without the slight_scratches and beer stains ) i wouldn_'_t think_twice about putting it on ebay or something similar as a used phone .
M	well to be certain i emailed the question to frost , ie .
M	brilliant
F	the bone of contention for me was having to pay for a full_tank of diesel on a 0 day hire .
M	maybe better to pay more and go eleswhere ?
F	very professional operators who get it right every time .
M	( attente d ' une semaine !)
M	after several booked delivery slots and a total_failure of any of the items to show up , we have now been informed that the company is in some kind of dispute with its delivery company and our items have been impounded by the delivery company .
F	when i rang i was told email must have gone to junk_mail and if you dont reply in five days they just send revised_offer .
F	they need to be upfront about delivery times and actual stock_levels in house .
M	and there a friendly bunch of guys .
F	mats despatched fine and as advertised .
F	all jason could do is tell me about terms and conditions which in all honesty the terms are i pay you deliver by the time you have advised on the confirmation or return my damn money instead of getting interest on my money and ruining my christmas because i will be sitting_around with no presents to give my family .
F	she passed me onto someone in the loyalty team who again asked why we didn_'_t want it and he tried hard to convince us to keep it .
F	i will now have to prune it well down and hope it regrows .
M	i went on to the web to place another order some months later , but did not complete the transaction .
F	i can only_assume that all parcel0go staff work from home so can wait in for several days in the hope that a courier might turn_up , most of us can '_t .
M	i have never used this service before as i have stopped wearing_contacts a while ago .
F	last_year i booked a holiday for me and my disabled_mother .
F	the gardman wood large planter arrived intact , no pieces missing and no damage at all .
M	i will be looking there again when i require some more glasses etc .
M	poor service but much worse than that unprofessional behaviour and dishonesty .
M	even the vet was impressed by their prices and they provide the prescription proforma too .
M	thats what i call service
M	ordered for special_occasion so needed same day what i ordered only to to recieve confirmation_email_stating it would be delivered the next_day , customer service no assistance said they would try to arrange it flowers did turn_up following_day not impressed will not be using again
M	i assumed i would pay the rest via the site also , and had to quickly run out for the final cash , a bit_annoying that this wasn_'_t pointed_out in the ' how it works ' ( makes me think keeping it to three steps was more important than the usefulness , more marketing than anything ).
M	have to say that without a 00_%_discount , there would have been reservations - hence only 0_stars .
F	i do however have a comment regarding being_able to see how full the water_tank is , it is virtually_impossible to see how full the tank is and where the markers are for the litres if somehow this could be improved i would be even more impressed .
M	our budget changed and we waited til this year and it was half price , we saved £_000 and it was delivered free in 0 days .
M	i was happy with the dealings with farnham , but i will not be using them again because they send items by city_link .
F	reasonable_price
M	one star but should be less !
M	such a good price
F	what were we supposed to do ?
M	this meant a lengthy delay whilst another frame was ordered from italy .
M	first time using this site so i was wary about giving personal details and booking online .
F	best price could find on website and great product too .
F	can '_t see the functionality to store favourites , card_details , etc_., which would be good for repeat_orders .
F	service was very good - 0 day delivery .
M	trying to manipulate the reviews so all the products look good .
F	dreams said they had tried to call but we had given them the wrong number with one too many digits on it .
M	when they did the service was fast and efficient .
F	i had already questioned if a large bouquet was being sent as the confirmation for the the reorder was
M	the web_site is easily_navigated and the ordering_process simple to follow .
F	when i first came upon this site , i really liked it as i thought i was getting honest_opinions of shopping sites .
M	as simple and easy as you ' d hope for .
M	the help i received at the horsham branch was fantastic though .
F	we miss our cappuccinos which were always offered to us every time we visited the shop .
M	it was delivered in less_than 0 minutes and saved me about £ 0 compared to buying it in tesco !
M	if you hardly use the internet and just want it for loading very basic webpages with no flash / media content on it then maybe its the one for you .
M	morons .
M	brilliant service and thank_you
M	great set of irons at a great price .
M	if you have any sense at all , avoid chaos_cards .
M	i wanted it to use with my pc and assumed that it would be of normal size .
M	oh no it didn_'_t .
M	you '_ll get a similar spec machine for a good few_hundred_pounds elsewhere but it won_'_t look as pretty !
M	instead i will spend the £_00 or so needed to buy a new thermostat from a more reputable_company , i cant face dealing_with this lot again and receiving more insults .
F	i ordered a few items from a clothing company who use yodel as their couriers .
F	!
F	i find the site very easy to navigate and to up load pet_prescriptions .
F	the delivery driver was very polite and helpful too .
F	it was a thursday and needed it for the weekend so ordered next_day delivery but realised it had to be before 0pm and i placed the ordered at 0 . 00pm but it still came the next_day !!
M	complete dog sh_* t with lots of unnecessary_stress .
F	using a search_engine i found this comparison web_site and saved money .
M	cleaning stuff left at front_door not really acceptable or professional .
F	often have good deals on alcohol , but i don_'_t drink much .
F	i waited around for quite a while for a sales_assistant to take my order , i felt like they ignored me as being a girl in my early 00s , they probably didn_'_t expect me to buy anything or spend much .
F	!
M	the majority of my orders have been cancelled and refunded as store stock is not updated on the website listings , and from time to time when they list something with the wrong price they say ' its just been sold in store today ' to get out of giving you a bargain .
F	the website itself is very easy to browse and its easy to find what you ' re looking for .
F	no postage_costs either .
M	three_days have passed since my last email to them and they now tell me that i have to wait another five days before they can tell me if they will be delivering any time soon .
F	very happy .
F	but . although i was told to expect my delivery on thursday having waited in until about 0 it took two calls to customer_services to learn that there had been trouble at the northampton depot and my goods would not be delivered .
F	so this meant a wasted day for me waiting for my bags to be collected and no one arrived .
M	the ring is beautiful , much_better colour and clarity than the ones i had been looking at and up to 00_%_cheaper too .
F	on the phone they pass me to different people every few_minutes , none of whom understand the situtation so i have to explain each time .
M	when requesting a refund due to an inferior product being supplied , i was told that it was beyond the 0 day return period .
M	none of these items were in stock !!!
F	where is the item i have paid for ???????
M	definitely recommended .
F	google tried to deliver your message , but it was rejected by the server for the recipient domain thehut . com by mail00 . thehut . net .
M	atv tour : very good trip , very informative guides , small group ( 0 ) made it more personal and son got gluten_free lunch .
F	no definite answers , no sincere_apology and no compensation / gesture of goodwill offered .
F	the meet and greet service is a really convenient idea and the driver was prompt and polite .
M	so_far used several_times with no_complaints but not tried in colder weather yet .
F	they also gave thorough descriptions and a floor plan .
F	i already have roller_blinds but thought i would order on the internet , the cord for pulling the blind up and down is very poor quality and i don_'_t see it lasting for a very long time .
F	delivery was fine and came quick and easy process to order .
F	advised goods dispatched 00th_dec - actully recieved very late_afternoon on 0th_jan by yodel couriers .
F	expensive , disgracefully disorganised parking , horrible expensive messy food , tatty displays of lego buildings which were originally nice but now not properly maintained , too few staff , long_queues .
M	yes i ' d buy here again as it '_s the product that matters , but i would like to see a little more pace in the rear of house functions .
M	cost_effective and fun uses for magnets !
F	other order the same plus they have been delivered to wrong_address

M	ulumi .
F	yodel could give me no information whatsoever of the whereabouts of my package , no tracking_number , not even the name of the carrier who now has it or what address it is going to .
F	after this , they would not let us book as they had messed something_else up in october ( booked a hotel room , then cancelled it , then charged us twice ) which was blocking my account .
M	ordered item and it arrived a few_days_later
F	a bit misleading so i stated the delivery information should reflect this as some companies still operate on bank_holidays .
F	don_'_t think it will last long .
F	reliable , quick delivery .
M	i only used this site because i had a 00_%_discount_voucher .
M	will not use them again .
M	we registered 0 cards with quidco ( my wife and i ) at times the card_details got erased so any purchases made did not register .
F	as a couple , we had a private_room with a balcony and the bathrooms were always quiet so it felt like a hotel , but nicer and more_homely .
F	sent off my perfect_condition i phone 0s and surprise_surprise it has triggered water_damage ?????

M	i used spectrum for my new range of illustrated giclee_prints .
M	at our age the bunk_bed is neither comfortable or safe .
M	i had never bought a game online like this before and was unsure if it was a good idea , i thought maybe i should just go into_town and buy it from a shop like the good old days .

F	as you know it is scary in this current_climate and i have had ver positive_feedback from ltd companies , little do they know i will be taking them up on there of of assistance .
M	ordering was easy and delivery wast timely , unfortunately when the boxes we ordered arrived a number of the lids were cracked / broken , no doubt this occured in transit .
F	it meant that there was a long delay before i got my refund , as i had not noticed that i needed to do this .
M	it is not my responsibility to stop them from destroying themselves .
M	tried to order head phones reviewed by computer active .

M	at the end of the day they were only 0 %_cheaper_than a main_dealer who did the job in 0 hour on the spot .
F	it even has its own metal stand and looks really elegant on my work station .
F	had i not been out of the country this company would have had a very nasty phone_call from me and a request to uplift their goods and refund my money .
M	they make you pay € 00 up front for fuel , as the car is supplied with a full_tank , and tell you to return it empty .
M	then out of nowhere , a small slab of lasagne arrived in front of me , stone cold !!!
F	it certainly looked more in the ad .

M	when my wife asked politely and deferentially if someone ( a technician ) could call and remedy the problem she was firstly stonewalled then instructed to provide photographic_evidence via a camera phone download and when she graciously pointed_out we do not have the expertise or the facility to provide this evidence the unhelpful individual became abusive and ridiculed her stating management of the company would decide_whether a visit was necessary based on the evidence we must provide . with the help of our son ( we are a retired couple and computer novices who simply require patience and assistance which is sadly_lacking on this occasion ) we have forwarded the required pictorial evidence .

M	after a hitachi deskstar hard_drive i purchased from tekheads that came with a standard ( global ) 0yr_warranty failed in its 0nd year i tried to return it directly to the manufacturer only to find it was a us model and that i had to " contact the supplier ".
M	this is why i think busuu should only be used as an additional tool coincide with a language course or book and not a single learning resource .
F	i purchased them several months before the event .
M	i have looked for an_alternative service and cinema paradiso fits the bill ( they even have up to date titles ) however the service i want costs £_00 per_month and now i have netflix which would take me over budget .
F	why , if something is out of stock was my account debited on the original day of collection ?

F	now 0_weeks on my ' new phone ' has had to be sent off again for the exact_same problem only this time when i went into the store the sales_advisor told me it was a ' common fault ' on the specific model i had , clearly upset i asked was there anything i could do even suggested paying more to my existing contract to change the model phone ( which i shouldnt have to seeing as the model they sold me on a 00 month contact hasnt even lasted 00 and was malfunctioning as of its own accord and not my fault ) to which i was told to basically ring o0 customer_services and ' kick off '.
F	boots good however not impressed that day they arrived they went on sale saving a further £_00 . 00

F	i immediately contacted yodel who told me that it would be passed on and i would get call as a matter of urgency .
F	i have ordered from medic_animal before with no_problems , however this time round was let_down when part of my order was missing .

F	one of the shoes had faded , maybe it had been on display for a long time , the delivery service was excellent .
M	i originally booked for the the tuesday .
M	so you need scales that read kg '_s .
F	each_step of the process seems to have a different method of communication - you have to report it in person at the airport , then fill in an online form then you get a noreply email_telling you to send a fax , then a letter saying they plan to pay you , but no cheque and so it goes on !
F	i ordered a bouquet of flowers for my mothers 00st_birthday .
F	when i complained they advised that staff were training , but offered no money back or discount for my problem .
M	well i ordered a subwooffer cable late one night after reviwing various other_sites mainly_because they had a short length cable i required as some other_sites only had cables that were far to long for my needs anyway lo and behold it arrived by post 00_hours_later needless to say i was delighted at the service
F	i have now waited almost 0_weeks on an_email_advising when i will receive my refund .

M	!

F	dissapointing .
F	would recommend .
F	great service !
F	i clicked on live_chat to find out if couriers would be happy to carry the package and got through to william .
F	they had both my phone number and email on record .
F	very accommodating when i was unable to meet their original seven day deadline due to illness - they were prepared to honour their original offer without having to start the whole_process again
M	it '_s nice to order from a company that shows care to it '_s customers and offers such a professional service !
M	many_thanks
M	ordered a custom audio electronics wah_pedal , was the lowest i could_find it online and arrived the next_day ( and received text_messages to tell me what time the item would arrive ).
F	need to be more cheap
M	i was satisfied although there was no communication that the delivery times would be much greater due to new years , however i had already factored in extra time .
F	ps if there was an option off zero_stars , that '_s what i would give them .
M	eventually_managed to get hold of a customer service advisor who didn_'_t immediately leave the company , and at that point the order process wad flawless .
M	i would recommend them top anyone .
F	the only_negative_point is the alarming speed at which we used up the toners supplied with the printer .
F	absolutely no_probs - everything completed in a timely_manner !!
M	he simply said i should have pushed in to the head of the small queue outside the tiny office .
M	i thought ok , i fuel the car with 00 € and guess_what .
M	i was very pleasantly_surprised to have a call from the us within minutes of ordering , to confirm the order details and ensure shipping details were correct .
F	before buying again i would ask for a sample .
M	iwm
F	disappointed !
M	when you cancel you do from that point not from the end of your subscription .
F	he had not been !!
M	i have used jokers_masquerade for a few_years_now for all my fancy_dress needs and have always been impressed with their efficiency , pricing and availability of products .

M	nice work !
F	we had a great honeymoon in mauritius with all parts of the holiday organised by holidaysplease .
M	00 / 00 /_0000 i received a delivery from amazon uk ( don_'_t know from which warehouse ).
M	i appreciate you want to make supplementary sales and profits , but lay off the hard_sell .
F	lovely range of products on an easy - to - use website , all of which was delivered on time and at a reasonable cost in time for christmas .
F	the flowers , in a rather poor quality basket looked insignificant in their setting .
M	ordered using my iphone while out , keys delivered within a day or so .
F	at this point , husband had been on for over three_quarters of an_hour insisting on speaking to someone in charge .
F	not partmaster '_s fault directly but packaging when i did finally get product was appalling .
M	my dealings with mobilecashmate came as a shock as i had never known such appalling methods to steal from people .
M	i gave 0_stars for the after - sales and no_fuss service .
M	every order i have made for fish products now comes from charterhouse_aquatics .
F	flowers didn_'_t arrive until very end of the day and courier didn_'_t even ring the bell , just left them by the front_door !
M	bought a computer from these and it developed a fault after 0_weeks .
M	it '_s been 00 days now and no refund .
F	they would not let_me lodge a complaint after 00_mins on the phone , and said they would call me every day until i agreed to close it , well i won_'_t .
F	what else can be said about that ?
M	we had to get a taxi because we couldn_'_t get a rental car .
M	just a short_walk to the terminal .
M	i always use argos as it '_s invariably the cheapest option and uses the most reputable car_hire_companies .
F	literally !
F	a pool_table is advertised but it is of very poor quality , the baize is too slack , the cues are unsuitable and the cover leaks .
F	we followed the correct procedures and gave a months notices as per terms and conditions .
M	i had to dismantle it and wait fir the replacements to arrive .
F	i had my order delivered to my work place where other staff_members also get their orders delivered to .
M	it '_s little_touches like this that make the difference and i will use again when my current supplement need renewal .
F	this could have been prevented if only somebody would have put the earrings in a inexpensive plastic_box .
M	can '_t fault delivery and turn_around time though , spot on , a credit for the return postage due to your error ?
F	it went wrong again within 0_days of coming out with the same problem .
F	the emails you get to update you where your money is and when you will receive it is very handy so you know where u stand .
F	we had an excellent driver and polite and knowledgable courier at the outset of our bus_tour .
M	my issue was never resolved .
M	happy with work but image should have been made clearer through my options .
M	i wrote a constructive review of the products addidas f00 keeper gloves on there web_site and the sportsdirect . com moderator removed the review and said it wasn_'_t allowed .
F	quick and easy to book - friendly and efficient operator - competitively_priced - would use again .
M	0 things .
F	keep informed each_stage and delivery was when the email said .
F	especially with the new ' timeline ' major changes that affect the users are forced upon them and make the site confusing and annoying however it is still a good place to connect to friends you can '_t see in person a lot .
M	it is a pure money_grabbing operation .
F	however , on one occasion , returned an item which surfdome claimed not to have received - very disappointing .
F	i have contacted them 0 times and have yet to receive a reply , have also tried to ring them without_success .
M	i am smarter than them and got my claim in before the deadline date and paypal refunded from their account .
M	currys ) i could have ordered an item and had it delivered to my local homebase for me to collect .
M	( however the blind itself was not damaged ).
F	we had to wait over 0 hours late at night in the port building with 0 young_children ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) which was cold no where for them to sleep and the facilities to get anything to eat or drink was very poor .
M	i ordered a set of ' ceramic frying_pans ' ( 0 piece set # 0000 ) for £_00 - 00 as shown in easylife catalogue .
M	waited for three_weeks for order to arrive , when i checked my order it said it had still not been despatched .
F	so i rang the next_morning , and still spent 00_minutes on hold .
F	awful service . will not recommend to anyone . better to pay a few pound more and get a proper service and less stress !
M	for a product ( por00 fuel preservative & stabilizer ( us pint )) costing_£_00 . 00 to pay £ 0 . 00 postage will unfortunately make me think very carefully before buying again - sorry !
M	bought a lawnmower for a good price and it was delivered the next_day .
M	add that fact they go missing for a week with no contact , then get various assurances of re delivery to all be dashed when finally the two rudest operatives arrive late on a friday_evening to slag off their job in front of a client then be rude to the client really re defines poor service .
M	sent the engines back - they could not find anything wrong .
F	!
M	after a few hours looking for an air lock we found some foam insulation had got into the tank and blocked the outlet .
F	excellent quality goods and swift delivery .
M	recomiendo a todo_el mundo la compra de neoprenos en esta página .
M	it strikes me that florists are one of those groups of businesses that pretty_much have to get it right .
M	if i stick to making a purchase i usually have weeks to wait for delivery .
F	i have , however , switched to another vlcd because i found that having 0 " meals " a day was much much harder that the 0 that i had on the previous vlcd .
F	i ordered 0 items , signed for the delivery , but when opened the box only 0 item , nothing about other item , packing_slip - didnt get one .
M	better late than never i guess !
F	will definitely not be using them again .
F	we are very disappointed .
F	i purchased this vanity_unit from big bathroom store when it arrived it so many faults it is easier to say what was right which was only the doors .
F	i can only surmise that this type of misuse has caused the damage ."
M	we purchased a samsung freestanding fridge_freezer , which we had seen at other electrical retailers at a higher cost .
M	this is especially important when it comes to bags of feed .
F	mine had a b_& q sticker on it when it arrived !
F	they all agreed it would be better to leave it as they didn_'_t want to wreck the chassis but luckily my step dad could put it in for me .
F	honest sale price , no_quibble .
M	first time trying to use their service , very dissatisfied !
M	many options were available and it was easy to book a hostel for my travels .
M	however , i booked my car in for 00am for an_hour long mot , and didn_'_t manage to get away until 00 . 00pm or so .
M	i had been intending to visit the guitarguitar shop to try out portable acoustic_guitar amplifiers .
F	we have recommended this website to other friends thinking of buying a new car .
F	at_least it would be better , if the unsubscription page was easily found in english .
F	they say hold the line and you will be put through to an adviser but cut you off instead , so you phone again and are kept hanging on so long you just give up .
M	they looked to be good quality at a reasonable price .
F	goods still not received .
M	it was well_packed and exactly as_described .
F	so .
F	after_contacting customer_services they refunded my postage but " politely informed me that this is a one off and they don_'_t usually do this " i would suggest hiring better delivery people as it is common courtesy to ring the doorbell on arrival at someones property .
M	both orders eventually delivered - mine as i have the items the other because i got an email_telling_me , i assume the second arrived at the correct address !
F	i was happy to wait for my goods so opted for the free delivery option .
M	juicer exactly as_described and so_far has performed as expected .
F	plenty of opportunity to change that slot if it had not been convenient
M	she has only just had a so - called engineer out who was unable to fix the issue .
F	this is our 0rd year with hospitality ffinder and once again a big thank_you to sue pearce for helping_us organise another amazing event at cheltenham
F	she received on time and was happy .
M	i was supposed to have had a parcel delivered on the monday_morning however i did not receive it at all that day , i checked my online order details with littlewoods & it told me that the parcel had been loaded on to the van at the lincoln depot however i did not receive it that day .
M	we returned their for our_wedding_rings , and when my wife was pregnant with our first child we returned once more to buy an_eternity_ring for her .
M	!
M	we purchase our salcura shower_gel on - line from natures healthbox and pay via_paypal .
M	the hertz_desk pointed_out the sbyc desk in a manner indicating that it was certainly not the first time a weary traveller had to ask the same question .
M	las_vegas trip worked out cheap compared to the deals i was getting during the time .
M	next comes the fitting of the sink .
M	and they out ; lasted the serenata ones by 0 days !
M	after a thorough_search , watch supermarket had the lowest_price for the watch i wanted .
F	however , their delivery service let them down .
M	well , i went on line and followed the couriers instructions as to where they could leave my parcel .
F	very quick and efficient
M	i have requested a refund twice , still_waiting now nearly two months , so like their products will probably wait about a year to receive .
M	did not turn_up on the day it should
M	i do hope this call is recorded and listened back to .
F	you are rubbish rubbish rubbish bunch of theives who ruin people '_s credit and give absolutely nothing for loyalty to you .
F	an easy friday_afternoon ordering tyres off the internet , came recommended to me , happy to continue the trend .
F	the villa has satellite_tv but it would make it far more enjoyable if there was also a sky package as not all of us go out in the evening / most evenings .
M	so assuming the range was exclusive to topps , we thought we would wait_until the next offers came in .
M	i sent olotels an email on 00th_november , immediately after_speaking with the hotel , to advise .
M	i have now been offered an_alternative colour which is not acceptable .
F	disapointed that i could not speak to anyone to solve a major problem .
M	yodel : we was never contacted to advise for this to be returned david .
M	beautybay has good prices overall , but it takes loooong time to get the delivery .
F	the only_thing that i could_possibly fault was the delivery charge - with most websites , if your order is over_£_000 delivery is free .
M	go on treat_yourself !
F	the prices are not the cheapest and some stores give the delivery fee '_s after a certain amoun '_t and i '_ve exceded that amount in bouth the orders that i made , so i think that good coustemers should have a incentive to come_back .
F	0_months later i found they had been taking money from my account with no notice and no reciepts .
M	0o / c specialist battery identified and ordered .
F	i sent it to mazuma and got £_00 as agreed with no_issues at all .
F	i would definitely use them again !
F	their blog used to be more reliable
M	credit_card dispute raised and money refunded by barclaycard .
M	i was told because this product had been so popular there had been a delay and in fact the order had been dispatched today and would be with me in a week as it was coming from holland .
F	would defiantly recommend .
M	i will never sell to fonebank again , i sent a working second_hand iphone bought from ebay and they said it was stolen !!!
F	i booked my surgery and off i went and waited 0_weeks .
F	i ordered a pack , and i payed for it , but i have not got it yet .
M	if they had a truly local_depot i would have gone and got it but a round_trip of 0hrs is a bit much .
F	the roses arrived curly at the edges with brown leaves .
F	website very user_friendly .
F	thanks to holidays_please we got our dream_honeymoon to meeru island & resort - maldives .
F	i have been informed ' normally the refund can take up to 0_weeks on occasion for the refund to be initiated due to current processes we have in place .
F	villa_plus are very efficient and the location , privacy and space of the villa is excellent - as is the pool and the cleaning service but things that we were not happy with :-
F	i have also had online deliveries and have had no_problems .
F	dress itself with headband and choker were good but i gave the ' boots ' a miss !
F	what booking exactly ?!
F	i sent two_separate emails immediately to drinks_direct and have not had the courtesy of a response .
F	if this date / time did not suit , i was able to change it which was great .
M	" we will look into it ".
M	i have had a terrible experience overall and would strongly_advise people to avoid this company at all costs .
F	i think if they were to offer a good price deal compared to other_companies they would do much_better .
M	how the air staff managed is a miracle
M	i explained that this wasn_'_t my problem , this site offered a service and surely they should find someone_who would fulfil the order , that '_s what they charge their fee for ?
M	i travel to denmark on the sirena seaways every year , and look_forward to the trip as part of my holiday . this year , however , half way through our holiday , we recieved an e_- mail from dfds informing us that the ship had been damaged in a collision with harwich quay , but should be back in service before our return date . at no time was this incident reported on danish tv . i tried to email dfds on several adresses , but could not get a reply . i tried to phone the number given in the email , and got an_automated booking machine . 0 days before our return , we discovered the ferry was out of service for some time . with no options , contact , advice or assistance from dfds , we had no choice but to drive from mid jutland to calais , a 00 hour journey which cost me over £_000 in fuel alone . i have tried , so_far unsuccesfully , to recover this from dfds . a good danish holiday totally spoiled . my review , sirena seaways , 00 , dfds customer service , 0 .
M	so , often as not , i amble down the high_streets instead , and get decent stuff right away .
M	needed them urgently for a ski_trip , so paid air freight delivery !
F	delivery was late .
M	quality product , speedy delivery .
F	0 jan_0000 00 : 00 : 00_pm wednesbury west_midlands gb arrival scan
F	having signed into this site i am now inundated by emails for another part of the company business home_brewing which adds insult to injury .
M	steam_key was sent fast , and worked_perfectly !
F	when she got them some of the flowers were dead , some had literally grown fur and mould , she had to through them straight out because they smelt so bad being that they were rotting !
F	why would anyone pay full price from petshops when you can buy direct . delivered to your door and at a fraction of the cost
F	i don_'_t think it is victorian_plumbing '_s fault , the goods have obviously come from the manufacturer .
F	however , i will order from animed again as the prices are fantastic .
M	cheque arrived almost_immediately for £_00 .
F	finally the following_monday everything went through and we picked_up our car .
F	the only_reason for the 0 - stars was that parceforce took over a week to deliver the rug , despite it being on a " parcelforce 00 " delivery - i had to call around to parcelforce a few_times to track it , as there was no information on the online tracker .
M	- good value for money
M	however , when i contacted showerdoc , they organised a call back from one of their engineers who advised how to fit the part correctly .
M	inexperienced desk assistant ( 0 days in job ) gave_us car 0 grades lower_than paid for .
M	ultimately over a period of 0 months ( yes 0 months ) sky have not found a way of allowing me to call them without paying for the cost of the call .
F	there is a bailgate hotel , but don_'_t confuse them .
F	i booked almost_immediatly .
F	don_'_t be silly that would be far too simple .
M	this website is a scam designed to separate you from your money .
F	fast efficient service .
F	i applied the tint to the picture on the internet and it looked exactly_what i wanted so that '_s what i ordered .
M	pricewise , the tyres & fitting , worked out cheaper_than many other_sites .
F	we also prepay the delivery charge .
F	at the start of the process i received emails relating to other_peoples cases .
M	i was told that that one set of frames was no_longer available .
M	this , coupled_with a wide_range together with good prices offers great value - i '_ll be back soon and will be recommending you and your website to others .
M	i voted in may 0000 and am on the electoral role .
F	the recipient received them damaged and whilted .
M	i had to ring team c courier in the uk who told me for this package they were using dhl but this may change .
F	if no payment is received i will taking matters furthers and and i will get this shocking company closed_down for good .
M	i knew what style of radiator valve i wanted for our new slim line radiators , this was the only place that hade an_alternative to the big plastic standard parts , or very cheap unbranded parts with quality issues .
M	i will be using the service again !
M	an email to confirm that they have been delivered would just make the hole better .
F	do not buy from this supplier - products ordered several weeks_ago have not arrived , with no email explaining delay
F	tried to order on line but 00_% code not accepted , so had to resort to telephone_enquiry and then able to re - oreder on line .
M	so it was a bit of a false alarm .
M	there '_s a good range of products and secure methods of paymen but the preparation for post and packaging then delivery of the goods can be a w bit_slow .
F	i recently_purchased from partsmaster fusible discs for my pressure cooker in the pack there are three discs they are minute price off £ 0 . 00 ok postage £ 0 . 00 unbelievable these discs would fit quite safely in a small standard envelope
M	totally different quality when compared with these_cowboys !
F	this is a very professional company and i am extemely happy with their service and especially the quality of their chocolate !
M	well_done you out did your self again
F	i don_'_t find anything to write beside my anger .
M	i was given a product ref which i then ordered which was not what i needed and thus useless .
F	to then just repeat the policy and process at me over and again instead of looking to find a solution especially when i was clearly upset just showed the poorest service and lack of care .
M	i would recommend mazuma to anyone easy website .
F	my partner '_s was paid in full , but when i returned all the correct statements i was only given a part payment - no explanation was ever offered .
M	i must_say i '_m slightly dissapointed with the service this time , i ordered the ' grandissamo ' roses and considering the price their was nothing grand about them .
M	this is not how to run a business .
F	very good service and excellent telephone help , told me a date my order was to be expected and arrived on that day .
F	i wanted to file all my paperwork but could not get out to purchase one , so i purchased the product that i thought would work from the website of wham which i saw on t . v .
F	i find this unacceptable , especially from a company like aspinal .
M	i tweeted their " customer_services " team who asked for a postcode .
M	for the price the product is better_than can be expected .
M	they know they have to issue a refund but would leave me out of pocket rather_than deal with it at the last moment .
M	i would recommend mr_memory .
F	now that '_s what eflorist should say on their website , it would in my experience be more honest !
F	i had contacted another travel_agent and travel_nation was the best in terms of flight convenience and price .
F	only wanted to borrow £_000 just to cover me till pay day and they phone you up several_times and ask for bank details and i only had to repay £_000 on my payday .
M	both the outer and inner packaging were damaged .
F	when the delivery was made i was out and although the driver claimed that he left a card i could not find it and the rescheduling of the delivery was not possible because i would be unavailable to receive it .
F	so upsetting and stressful for my mum and me .
M	after phoning tesco they initially told me it was my fault for not being at home , but they discovered that although my address was right in the system the print for the driver somehow cut_off the last digit in my flat no so they delivered to the wrong flat .
F	was told the flowers were lovely
F	i tried to call repeatedly , but the office is open day - time only and the lines are very busy .
M	the product was exactly_what i needed but express delivery was not express a fault of the delivery service used i believe .
F	all through the day i received emails and the final one stated the parcel would be with me between 0 . 00 and 0 . 00 that day .
M	not a good start but hey no_problems with my last car !
F	i have written to them direct but have not received a reply , so much for customer service
F	asked for flowers to be left with neighbour if no one in but instead simply but a card through door and put them over the wall into back garden where the dog was and could have destroyed them .
F	why ?
M	definitely recommend them .
F	the sample handles arrived in good time and were packed_securely .

F	their products are a great quality and value .
M	i would say that despite all their attention to detail for a simple service they are quite expensive as i ended_up paying over £_000 for replacement of 0 tiles and some re - sealing of a shower_door .

F	always goes up the creek when he '_s on holiday or sick .
M	from the order through to delivery , everything has_been smooth and professional .

F	which means i lost my money and had to reorder another one from them again , which cost me more .
M	i found this company online and decided to test them with a request for an iphone back cover .

F	needed a spare for my mira_shower .
F	i decided to ask apple_store itself .
F	at the moment he is only having problems with one but this kneepad has_been a godsend .
F	impressed with personal service and excellent communication setup - would recommend using this online shopping company as they appear to be reliable and efficient .
M	time_consuming to put up ( took me three_days , with no help ) but strdy and rigid when bolted to the ground .
F	i would definitely use this company again .

M	i have touched up with a anti - rust paint .

M	didn ; t have diary with me so ended_up going into the local_branch anyway to arrange the mot .
F	if i had not experienced problems , i would say that the simplistic ordering is great , and the ease of use fantastic .
F	boy was i wrong !
F	this is an informative web_site and fairly easy to navigate .
M	in future i will look no further .
F	i cannot_believe the messing_about i have had to do all because the product was the wrong_size if i had purchased the product on - line to start with and it was the wrong_size i could have taken it back to the store and got a refund straight_away .
M	i '_m_sure it won_'_t be too long before you all come unstuck . good luck with that !

M	kind rigards
M	as i said the flowers where lovely .
M	som_jeg_ikke føler at der bliver gjort ordenligt opmærksom på ( og selv fakturaen nævner det kun indirekte ved at lægge gebyret til buketprisen . så ser det jo nok lidt mindre farligt ud ?).
F	we needed to join 0 lengths of full_stave work_surface to go along one side of the kitchen but they were really different and looked awful when joined together .
M	great range of items at good prices .
M	despite constant attempts to get in touch with this company ( including having to do research and get a different number from another site he '_s involved with , petrotools ) i still have no goods or refund after 0 year .
M	even the courier used was good because it allowed festive_lights to email me with a rough time the courier would arrive and you could actually go to the couriers website and check where the driver was and what delivery number you were and what delivery number he was on .
F	we love italian food but , of course , there are some things we miss that you just can '_t find here in italy , e . g .

M	great price and look really good .
M	the car should be available with a minimum amount of petrol and then it should be up to me how much petrol to put in the car .
F	i phoned 0_days ago to ask where my refund was and they had no knowledge of the items being picked_up even_though i had phoned them when the delivery driver left with the items .
F	the flowers were up to your usual high_standard .
F	coffee sometimes loses its milk . due to high number of customers .
M	the fitter then ask us to sing some paper_work tell us that it was the delivery note for the windows that needed signing on 0 form as there was no carbon copy 0 form was placed over the first with just the signature line showing .
F	no_messing , quick and professional service .
F	probably not .
M	at this point it was getting late so i asked again if i would have my glasses the same day .
F	payment sense is very recommended , the set_up was extremely easy and painless , kevin torres answered all questions with much patience , and talked_me through the process and set_up with ease .
F	the person told me he did not know , to call scotrail .
M	highly_recommended !
M	i '_m hooked on napiers and tell all my friends about it .
F	next time i will return to a company who i can be sure of .
F	i contacted the company and had to prove this by sending a photo , which i did .
F	and some hair came off .
M	there was mastic all over the bricks around windows it looked like he had removed the nozzle from the gun and spread it around with a trowel .
F	doesn_'_t mean we won_'_t use it again but prefer the [_external_reference_] people although they don_'_t use the car_parks .
M	generally , buying on line is a good experience .
F	my clicksnap thing refuses to work as it states i have the wrong log in details .
F	not impressed !
F	reasonable_prices and delivery charges .

M	it was very efficient .
M	will use again
M	can '_t fault the service at all
M	however in most_cases your money will be taken and that is the last you will see of it .
F	decent price and quick delivery .
F	we currently having a lot of work done at the moment and did not inspect it thoroughly - lesson_learnt .
M	went into the derby store to buy a sim only deal because i already had a phone and just needed a sim_card for a few_months .
F	i was quite disappointed with rentalcars . com because of that .
M	as a shopping_experience , it was really easy .
M	took it back to the dealer for repair under_warranty and got a bill for £_000 .
M	otherwise , a nice arrangement
F	when you pay £ 0 . 0 for a next_day delivery you expect to have your parcel the next_day .
F	this may be because of the splitting - it is my guess that this should not have passed quality control .
M	daily contact much too much !
F	and they said it was discontinued in the colour i had ordered .
F	i sent an_email about this and am still_waiting on a reply !!
M	i organised for the goods to be taken after discussing the cellophane so that a 000_pound refund could be made .
F	but looking today , the website still is showing the green & white .
M	shelves fitting in space allocated for them and cross struts at some places ).
F	use this website if you want good quality clothing at very reasonable_prices .
F	every number i try is the same automated_message with no option to speak to a real_person .
M	it '_s about the principle !
M	:-(
F	the finish of the end product in some places was lacking such as underneath , i . e .
M	shame that the packaging stated who the goods inside we ' re from .
M	banglads alway have a huge rang in style underwear and clothing and always keep there stock list well up to date .
M	the least they could have done would be to use next - day shipping for an order that was placed over a month_ago , but they did not .
M	the delivery man handed the box to her upside_down !
F	i contacted them , and they got back to me within 00mins of my e_- mail to tell me they had changed it to the correct prescription .
M	one little gripe , although their new trade_counter is superb i find the queing system tedious and time_consuming .
M	i tried to sell a computer on ebay a while ago using myhermes and it was a total_disaster .
M	however , our two most_recent trips have been a bit painful .
M	i wrote back very angrily outlining why this was unacceptable .
M	unfortunately , due to us regulations , you can '_t have the fake review removed by the site owner and they don_'_t seem to care about it anyway .
F	i '_ve made nearly_£_000 mostly through the free deals !
M	they are also extendible which adds to their versatility with the ability to mix and match with other sets .
M	i ordered a curtain_pole which for the price , i was expecting to be solid_oak , however , when it arrived i was very disappointed to find it was cheap softwood , stained an oak colour !
M	in writing , for all to see !
F	ordering is easy and delivery super_fast - had computer problems so phoned the order through and then confirmed it online and it all went_smoothly with goods arriving next_day !
F	0nd_october nothing , so sent an_email , 0th_october no response to the email , called the free phone number ( 00000 000 000 ) but was a dead tone , had to call the 0000 number only to get through to a voicemail , 0th_october call was returned with voicemail left advising supplier delay no further details .
M	i was talking to a friend about the cost of receiving faxes from booking agents for my hotel , he suggested i tried soho 00 and could not make up my mind until i spoke to them direct , and signed_up instantly this is going to save me appox £_000 . 00 per year , best move i have ever made .
M	no_fuss .
M	no call back .
M	the small_print stated the local supplier may require the purchase of a full_tank of gas , with no option to return the car in the same fuel condition as collected .
M	i still purchase from them so first point of contact is essential . remember me please .
F	i was delighted with the service you provided and my sister in law was delighted with the flowers .
M	i used the mobile service .
M	hope this helps , ive_used this site once and never again
F	i got a refund in the end but it took several days and granny didn_'_t get any flowers for her_birthday .
F	i recommend them to everyone ( even the lady in the post_office when i sent some glasses back - i '_d forgotten to get a sunglasses_tint and they redid them for free ).
M	hi , these remotes are half the price of the originals and work well .
M	when enquiry was made as to delivery of item the response was rather off hand and not very helpful .
F	lucky for me that it did not rain or anyone walking past didn_'_t think their christmas had arrived early .
M	he was very rude when i said i ' d sign once i ' d seen the goods .
F	i spoke to a guy in customer_services who also said their terms and conditions had been changed on the website this tuesday 00th_march - my contract was formed on the 00th_february
M	i only wish they ' d told me it would take 0 hours so i could have done something more useful with my time .
F	it quite clearly_stated after i paid the total amount requested that the total amount due to hotel was 0 .
F	i took my mother to nice and knew she is easily stressed , booking this meant she didn_'_t have to worry_about shuttle_bus , time , where did we park the car . etc .
F	i always buy the worm_tablets for my 00 dogs and i have had no_problems with vet -_medic they always arrive on time no problem ordering them online and a lot_cheaper_than the vet !
F	it was about £_00 cheaper_than instore so this and previous_reviews persuaded me to but it from white &_bishop .
F	no one bothered to contact me and no one bothers to answer the phone . ever !
F	:(
F	the prices are brilliant compared to high_street shops and the delivery of my order spot_on .
F	i still_haven_'_t heard from selectspecs not even an_apology .
F	les_prix pratiqués sont les moins chers sur_le net .
F	excellent service in shop furniture excellent .
M	i ordered a jacket from their website on a sunday , they said it would arrive with me on the following friday in time for my camping_trip .
F	while we were away , we realised we had booked the driver to pick us up too early , so spoke to sun_transfers who rearranged the pick_up time and text and emailed us the confirmation details .
F	we found customer_services in all_aspects of sales to enquiries to be ecellent .
F	normally good experiences but wondering what has happened to some shoes
M	not sure i '_ll use solopress again for such a job unfortunately
M	checked out many car_rental_companies , yours was the best price , we wanted a basic vehicle , to buzz around the island .
M	the bouquet was mostly padded out with gypsophila ( all of which i removed before giving to my wife ).
F	we do a lot of fancy_dress events every year , and i '_m not sure if i '_d use the company again or not .
M	i will however do my utmost to ensure that all my business and mail contacts do not get caught out by these_people and will approach local_newsagents to remove their future catalogues from papers if my refund doesnt appear .
F	we '_ll be calling in store for a tv / hifi cabinet soon .
F	avoid
M	issue selected - i have a problem with my order
M	i give them a bad address , 0 minute after order i tell them about the error but they said to me that the article was shipped and no possibility to change address . now i '_m hoping tha however will arrive .
F	!
M	disappointed that i received a renewal_notice which quoted an increase of 00_% on last_year !
M	and this seemed to be the best way to get some premium quality tyres at a reasonable price .
M	it should of been called nosebook , invite the outside world into your underwear draw , but if you want to flag your birthday or make your x pay attention then this one is for you ( beware you may end up on jerry springer ).
M	in short , delivery times bad , prices bad , postage prices bad , customer_services will just fob you off with a short default reply .
F	the delivery man was very efficient and professional .
F	definitely recommended !
F	they left a card .
F	on thursday waited_until 00am then called to see if they could let_me know a time .
F	we really felt we had made a friend by the time we finished .
M	to my disappointment the one shoe was new - the other shoe looks_like it was over 00 months old and been in their shop .
F	i decided to order the red instead .
F	product took ~ 00days to arrive , had to phone up to find out where order was .
M	blink and you will miss the next_day delivery !!
M	waste my engineers time and my money standing on the phone or down loading to a computer a wiring_diagram
F	black and white tiles ordered for chequered effect in hallway .
F	not a good experience as ordered and then was told could not get the bonus offer of free vouchers !
F	will be using this company again in the future .
F	thank_you !
M	i was told the estimated delivery date , - no delivery .
F	thank_you .
M	i rely_on fast reliable deliveries for my reputation and customer_satisfaction , these_guys help me to acheive this by running a tight_ship when it comes to quality delivery systems .
F	their beds are rubbish and customer service even worse .
M	april .
F	i kept coming_back to appliances_online and although the prices were the same as some on the high_street , it was their customer service that made me choose this company .
F	departure - the app that we were told to download didn_'_t allow us to find out our pick_up time , so i had to call them .
F	i was a bit_skeptical as to them wanting payment upfront and in full , and i actually stumbled_across this site before i ordered and paid as i was trying to discern if they were a legit company or not .
M	!
F	not the colour really as shown and the material shiny due to blackout linings very good tie_backs prompt delivery would probably buy from them again
M	pleased my parcel had been collected on time i thought all was well !
M	simply excellent !
M	daniel on phone was helpful , ordering on line was easy and the delivery was within the 0 - 0 days advertised .
F	went in store to ask a few questions about what deals / tariffs they have got and the staff_member said , " just a minute " looked away and started talking to his friend at the counter , 0 minutes later i was walking down the road .
M	ah
M	at 00 . 00_hours i am informed they have been delivered to a secure_location - a different address in the same road on the opposite_side .
M	on looking at the paperwork , we should have been offered an option to bring the car back full , which we weren_'_t .
M	i asked how i arranged to pay line rental in advance and was told it was an option in the basket .
M	quick response and delivers when promised .
M	incorrect items .
F	however i am now with everything as the whole item could not have worked ,
F	i was informed of my delivery day so i arranged to be in all day so that i didn_’_t miss the parcel only to check online at 0pm that apparently my goods were back at the depot due to a failed delivery attempt !
M	he promised me that someone would get back to me yesterday , no one did .
F	all good quality .
F	yeah my hammer was great made my husbands live a lot_easier at work .
F	as i 00 year_old this was a difficult_task , one i do not want to repeat .
M	my second a breitling_navitimer turned_up in excellent condition albeit with a brown rather_than black strap .
F	the men were grumpy and unhelpful and i have made a formal_complaint about them .
M	aol blamed everything from filters to the router to windows , basically anything_else apart_from them .
M	no contact to say its not coming .
M	i then called today to find out why it is still not showing only to be told the domain
M	go to any vip collectors record fair and you will find virtually all cd singles for sale in those same pvc sleeves : it is standard_practice .
F	i have gone from being an ambivalent customer to now being a very frustrated and angry one : {
F	not so !!
M	wouldn_'_t hesitate to use them again .
F	eventually the order was sent out by royal_mail express delivery and arrived within 00_hours .
M	i have a fedex number finally . but it '_s still not registering .
M	all i want is my repair money refunded and my property back or my glasses replaced but am getting_nowhere .
F	excellent !
M	great choice , really helpful staff , fast delivery , free returns .
M	the prices clearly showed whether they included_vat or not , unlike_other competing websites who leave you in the dark until the final stages of payment .
F	companies like ups , dhl etc wont talk to us because as far as they ' re concerned the " customer " is interparcel .
M	the service and delivery time was first_class with molarclaen but i was disappointed with the product .
F	shipping promised 0 - 0 working_days .
M	avoid
M	got car from sixt tampa .
F	also nearly_missed plane because the admin of purchasing a boarding card took so long .
F	he was informed by the member of staff that loyalty only meant something to them when they were taking out new contracts to get better deals .
M	i have enjoyed a few orders and will_definitely be ordering from them again in the future .
F	fast , trustworthy , low_prices .
M	not only was it the best price i could_find , it was also free delivery and i received the product two_days after i ordered it .
F	i did like shopping on line but its cheaper elsewhere .
F	no reply to e_-_mails and it would appear that the contact telephone_number has_been disconnected !
F	excellent service .
F	upset as they were in memory of my grandad who had passed_away .
F	do not buy anything at infurn .
M	the only down_side was the mountain of packaging that comes with the items ( but you get you items undamaged ).
M	unfortunately it had not arrived 00 working_days_later , despite standard delivery being described as " within 0 working_days ".
F	big waste of money and no respect for other people .
F	0nd experience i had with them was when i ordered something from zaggora - ordered some expensive clothing which i really wanted to arrive quickly .
M	in addition , when they have a sale , they pass these huge_savings on to the the customer .
M	if you have any other queries .
M	not the best bunch of flowers i have ever ordered thats for sure .
F	the new type of batteries are useless after the first time they ' re used .
F	the website states it will be received within two_weeks .
M	well_done white &_bishop .
M	musclefood are cheap and the food is unbelievably good .
M	we urgently_needed moustaches for a 00st_birthday_party ; i had not been given much time to grow my own - only 0 days notice !
M	day 0 ) simple onscreen instructions to i . d .
M	i wasn_'_t sure about buying sports gear over the internet but having used sportpursuit , i am now addicted ( i '_ve made more than a dozen purchases and counting ).
M	after 00_minutes on the phone receiving a really hard_sell i managed to get the slimy toad off the phone .
M	i will_definitely be using petfleas . co . uk again .
F	bought two more pairs of glasses as so pleased with value and service . will probably get some more and recomend to everyone .
M	this was a bit_annoying as your delivery policy states it won_'_t be delivered to another house or signed for by anyone apart_from at the final address .
F	the tags were really simple to apply and i will return for more when these run_out !
F	thanks you .
M	i wonder where i will be tempted to get my pc parts from in the future .
F	a new set is expensive but i was able to order just one ball from jacques at a fairly reasonable_price .
M	the first day we tried to view a car we were left waiting half an_hour without being seen ( and weren_'_t ther only ones !)
M	good easy process on the website . however national are advising ( after ) the purchase that additional_costs due to possible removal of under covers that there may be an additional_charge . this is a scam and should be priced in to the job . no other garage does this or indeed highstreet tyre and exhaust companys like kwikfit etc_etc .
F	i ordered 0 pairs of sheer pretty_polly control top tights - i had ordered these before and loved them , and more_importantly , they lasted more than 0 or 0 wears before snagging .
F	yet again the parcel didn_'_t arrive when it should have .
M	this company is letting down the businesses that use them to deliver their product
F	no proper contact and line was suspended even_tho i had tried to pay bill rubbish service
M	my mam loved the flowers and i would highly_recommend .
M	would recommend without_reservation .
F	i cannot recommend shoetique enough !
F	i had an_email letting_me know and asking me what i wanted to do which was great but then no one replied to my email and the number they provide to call for assistance didn_'_t work .
M	this now over 0 month since the order was placed , this will be my last update until the goods arrive ??.
M	regards
F	00_hours , then the day before they rang to say they couldn_'_t find anyone to do a delivery .
F	also said a courier would collect today but no one turned_up .
F	i was attracted to iflorist by the lovely arrangements and pledge to deliver on actual mothering_sunday .
F	no_problems at all .
F	great ear_muffs , can '_t fault the service , but they stuck a big orange sticker on the outside of the ugg box , which i wanted to keep . thus ruining the box when i removed it !
F	my complaint was handled very well and i went on to order a subsequent book without difficulty .
F	they paid the money in straight after they tested the mobile .
F	today i have finally taken delivery of an electric recliner_chair , for my grandmother .
M	not good news for savers admittedly but much_better if you are borrowing .
F	i understand you pay the market rate for this sort of thing , but there is no competition - as far as i can see viagogo were the only option - and can therefore charge what they like .
M	be very careful or setting from these_people - not much customer_care is on offer if the order gets lost .
M	we were looking for new dining_chairs .
M	besides ; me sending it back won_’_t be worth it as the item is £ 0 . 00 ( including tax ) and p_&_p ( postage and packaging ) is near enough £ 0 . 00 and me sending it back would be about the same and you people probably_won_'_t refund return postage so i '_ll be left with £ 0 . 00 .
M	as per prior times , order was complete , well_packaged , and priced ok .
F	you have no interest in the customer and accurate representation of service .
F	courteous and thoughtful .
M	so if you are wasting more time than you have i recommend that you do the same .

F	when we took pool cover off on first day there was a dead grass / seaweed we had to get out of bottom of pool

F	very easy to fit , with the added_bonus of 0 brackets .
M	strings_direct is a first_rate supplier of guitar accsessories .
F	easy to use web_site made ordering easy .

F	i have been really impressed with the service offered by trophy_store .
F	idiots !!
M	two trips back to my optician made me look a right muppett .
M	i '_ve read a lot of awful reviews here .
F	there are always special_offers on their site making the buying of known_brands acceptable .
M	i '_m not impressed , the guitar cost a smidge under 0 grand and i don_'_t have set of matching tags and handbook to go with it .
F	pasta_maker very good already used it and made great pasta .

M	cannot_comment on flowers as had them delivered 0 other end of the country .
M	i hear it ’_s going to be cold this winter and this will keep me warm while out and about .
F	i found my experience of ordering on line quite difficult , not enough help and information given .
M	the shed turned_up on a flat - bed van , with one driver .
M	sometimes i just either ended_up using my phone ( dunno if it uses a different access point to the mobile_broadband service ) or just driving along and waiting until i reached home or the office where there '_s wi_-_fi .
F	no smile or a thank_you .
F	after_searching the internet to find one at a reasonable_price - they were priced anywhere between £_00 and £_00 - i came_across the i w hurst website , where it was available for around £_00 .
F	flowers delivered on the day promised and beautiful arrangements .
M	good quality trophies and very good delivery .
M	they even lied and said they ' d been to the address and that the item had been collected !!!

F	it must have been much worse to have to speak to two people .
F	unfortunately i would not order from you again in case again i had to travel 00 miles to collect my parcel !
M	in the end i was able to use virgin_trains website , who also do not charge booking_fees and display booking summary information accurately before you pay .
F	my daughter runs track and had acquired a terrible case of shin splints in both legs - the kinesthetic physio tape helped relieve the pain she felt and protected her legs from further damage - the tape was super easy to apply and take off - and it arrived very quickly - excellent !
F	had a confirmation_email to confirm it was being_processed and that the tracking_info would follow
F	however i would like to say that the items i have bought have been very competitive in price .
F	i don_'_t understand_why pretty_much the whole of scotland is considered an extended areas in the uk which may has additional surcharge for postage .
F	filled in a form , they send you then envelope , you post it , they pay you .
M	i have used reemclothing for several_years and canot think of a time where the service has_been anything less_than excellent .
F	i was impressed with the communication from the company and the speed of delivery .
M	very poor .
F	i was then told that i should have been home for their arrival and that they were just about to leave without completing my delivery .
M	i asked to speak to someone to make a complaint - he told me it had to be in writing .
M	again selectspecs refused to refund what were clearly faulty items , even when i took the case up with trading_standards !
F	well_done !
M	out of stock but still advertise .
M	don_'_t need to spend my money in a shop to be accused of theft .
F	my order arrived the next_day .
F	it is really handy being_able to get those extras which are just not available here , and the prices are keen plus deliveries are reliable and quick - not always the case with other on line suppliers .
M	can recommend this firm
F	plus the messages confirming the delivery status were extremely_helpful .
M	!
F	!
F	i have always used a tour_operator , so was a bit_wary .

F	0quidhost are a rare hosting company where free actually means free , with no obnoxious adverts or pop_ups making the service unusable .
M	omg headache tense nervous headache .
M	david .
F	on top of this they overbook dramatically , they will take however many bookings they can and still claim they '_ll be collected the next_day which sometimes must be a physical impossibility .
F	i cannot see very well if there is light behind an object , am dazzled_by the glare off headlights etc and still see awful shadows around reflective surfaces .
F	i also had a couple of faulty products at the time too and they were very good with the way they dealt_with me & the issues - no one likes going in with a problem , let_alone 0 from one shop , so hats_off to them on this occasion .
M	asked driver twice which bus we needed and told wrong one both_times . luckily other persons on bus gestured to us to get on correct bus .
M	it wasnt until a couple weeks after xmas that i managed to get in town and to cex at which point i was rudely_told it wasnt their problem cause it was over the 00 days despite the game being purchased dec_00th and me not getting it until the 00th .
F	my son matthew has a range of very complex disabilities including autism / pda and leg deformaties .
F	my husband pointed_out that if this went off late next week , and took 0 working_days , we '_d be pushing four_weeks from ordering .
F	then received a text_message and an e_- mail from xdp today too to say that the eta for the delivery was between 0 . 00pm and 0 . 00pm : delivery or no delivery ?
F	felt like they only care for customers who are able to make a claim , if nothing come out of that , customers are not very important .
F	the person on the phone just kept saying yodel don_'_t do international_deliveries and therefore cannot help me .
M	the booking was painless but the payment element was a little odd .
M	the website says it takes 00 days to moscow and customer_services have told me that once it leaves the uk there is nothing they can do to find my parcel and i have to contact the russian postal service myself .
F	delivery quick and efficient .
M	there was no feeling that i was pedalling with my feet too far apart , it felt really comfortable as i could let my foot take up it '_s natural sticking out position with no fear of catching something with my heal .

F	would rather have half the fee back and buy glasses for tv and driving etc .
F	thank '_s gtech for these wonderful units it '_s 000 out of 00 you '_ve got to have them .
M	only ever had one problem which was resolved by the customer service team !
F	i had rushed around getting my eyes_tested so as they were up to date for this more_expensive purchase so i was keen for my order to arrive .
F	my mother was delighted with her beautiful flowers for mother '_s day .
F	now i have to wait wile they return the item ( no explanation given ) and the seller has to wait in and book another courier .
M	there was no_indication as to where the member of staff was or how long he was going to be on the desk .
M	why does it say that if we have a problem we can go to a store when they have no power to do anything ???
F	it was a great price and i had really looked around .
M	items , fast service and no mistakes .
F	i sent this message on the 0th_july , sent it again on the 00th_july when i received no response and then also sent a further message through the enquiry form on the website just to ensure that there was no way it could have been missed .
M	it is all very well advertising great prices but if you have to wait ages to be told its out of stock and then wait even longer for a refund then any discount is not cost_effective for the purchaser .
F	i purchased this last night and i still have not received any emails saying it was successful ??
M	the corners were not protected so it arrived slightly_damaged .
M	it is very good and dose the job it is allso priced right .
F	!
F	with no_problems_whatsoever i purchase exactly_what is needed for my 0 dogs to endure the fireworks period with less stress than before i discovered the adaptil collars
M	0 ) many items such as older games and action figures are out of stock all the time .
F	i then get messages from city_link that the appliance direct company order was on its way .
M	so i decide rather_than call and talk to someone ( if that was the experience i was after i would walk in a high - street shop and buy my cards there )
F	recommended to everyone .
F	booking was quick and easy , and we had a good email with useful info and directions .
M	delivered quickly .
F	does everything it says on the box !!!.
F	as i write this , i am looking at their website , specifically our product and i see ' mrs x just bought this product ' and ' 00 people are viewing this product at the moment ' and i wish i could reach out to each and every one of them individually and tell them to run screaming in the opposite_direction .
M	!
M	part arrived within_00hrs , well pacakaged
M	so a little dissapointed but not essentially a fault of serenata .
F	the internet is lagging as is the tv guide interface .
F	i emailed the plasticshop a couple of times with questions_regarding a worktop i wished to match up with an existing one .
F	so far i '_m not impressed .
M	no_problems no_hassle lovely present for our little_boy .
F	love this company , could spend a fortune here !
M	i have toyed with the idea of transferring all our old_vhs_tapes to dvd '_s for years .
F	sorry folks it '_s all about the money !
F	the product was exactly_what i expected it to be , great lip_gloss , great quality as its a nars product .
F	the
M	ram i ordered was delivered when expected and is exactly_what i ordered .
M	the facts :-
M	i ordered my equipment from toolstop on tuesday , and cancelled an arrangement for wednesday because the delivery was to be " next_day ".
M	i understand you have booked a new collection for today , they have confirmed this has now been allocated to a driver to ensure you have no further delays .
M	not to mention this brand_new rip_off called " be more dog " or " refresh " where customers ( the stupid ones ) can do an early upgrade if they want to loosing their discounts that would come at the end of their contract .
F	also the plaster started to fall_off the wall by the mirror
F	i was due to go on holiday and anxious that my order would not arrive in time - excellent speedy service .
F	but the delivery guy isnt interested in it and there is no email address for customer service , you have to phone up to complain .
F	i purchased something over 0yrs_ago from them not a phone and i certainly didnt give them my phone number i am registered with tps , so why are they harassing me . never in a million years would i buy even a earphone from them now
F	good price too .
F	against my better judgement i agreed and this has given me a great headache .
F	their service is excellent , the website is easy to use and paying via_paypal couldn_'_t be simpler .
F	the glasses are great , what more could you ask for ?
M	i accumulate our money and make a sterling / euro purchase on average four times a year this allows me the time to wait for the optimum exchange_rate .
M	i was happy with the service , but not happy i did not receive the full price originally offered .
M	i was told i had total insurance for car yet i was sold extra_insurance for tyre cover .
M	order arrived on - time and safe .

M	easy to book , clear website [ very nice to use - model to others ], and good price .
F	i doubt this csl suite will last 00 months . absolutely_shocking , guarantees worthless .
M	0 ) being an xlarge size and therefore long in the ' body ' i have found i have to be careful to ensure the zip is fully open to take it off ( i didn_'_t do this the first time and was well and truly trapped until i asked a stranger out for walk to help and she pointed_out my error out to me ).
F	even when i had ordered the wrong product , i returned it and got a refund with absolutely no_hassle .
F	i do not agree all the staff i spoke to that day were rude and didn_'_t care 0 women genuinely tried to help the situation but still after our conversation it was left unsolved .
F	very good service and very easy to use .
M	the company ask that you report any_issues within 00_hours of delivery , however they do not respond back to acknowledge the issue within the same timeframe which is disappointing .
M	but as stated your sales_team apologised and communicated very well .
F	i am so pleased with my glasses and the extra pair means i can keep one at home and one in my bag so i never forget them when i go to uni .
F	they then asked me if i wanted my old_appliance taking awy for free .
M	order should have been delivered to me by 0pm tuesday 0rd sept , after dealing_with live_chat someone eventually phoned me with such an attitude that i cancelled my order and asked for a full_refund , which they agreed !
M	i have not received the payment for this phone .
F	when lit , the lights look beautiful and are every bit as bright as mains powered lights - maybe even brighter - and the tiner function is great because i haven_'_t got to remember to turn them on and off .
F	the website has some great deals and good products however the delivery service is poor .
M	my guarantor was less_than impressed that he had to call in himself and wait for ages , i think really amigo should have called him .
M	especially since i have a ford_dealership not more than 0 miles_away from where i live .
M	ive been useing quidco for years never had any trouble always got my cash and i '_m more than happy to tweet

M	the flowers were for my fiancé for valentines_day . her comment was that there seemed to be more foliage than flowers .
M	not quite sure what 00_hours delivery means anymore .
F	she was horrified .
M	will think about it in a few_months time when i run out of frontline .
M	i believe this is probably why they can keep there prices so low , and also offer great product promotions at the same time .
F	i ordered 0sets of personalised playing cards from jessops , and then a further set .
F	what if people wanna do their shopping online and they want to use primark ?

M	she doesn_'_t have a computer .
F	howecer this time i have been charged_twice from my bank_account for the holiday -- not good .
M	now looking to see what i can_afford to buy next !
F	only issues i had was that the cost of delivery could have been 0 / 0 pound cheaper apart_from that very happy thank_you .
M	i was told because they had been busy there was a delay and they stated they will send the phone by guaranteed delivery and received this on the following_day .
M	prior to each purchase i have compared whats on offer by other_providers .
M	i am still_waiting answer till today .
M	if this was to be speeded_up a little then i would upgrade my regard for your company from good to very good .
M	very pleased .
M	she said she wasn_'_t interested but before she knew it the salesman had stepped inside and walked_into our living_room .
M	contacted customer_services on 00th to ask when i should expect it and they said they would come_back to me .
M	but this was a good thing as i soon realised that i didn_'_t have to go with the masses and go as dracula or a zombie .
F	so i couldn_'_t be bothered in the end and cancelled the whole_thing .
F	both_sets of glasses have anti_scratch coatings and anti_glare coatings .
M	constantly hangs - particularly after advert breaks .
M	called karcher head_office received a good reply ,
M	very disappointed !
M	the bottles always arrive when scheduled and are well_packaged to ensure no courier accidents !
F	fast an easy to understand an use !
M	the price was the cheapest i could_find and then the item arrived well_packaged and in a couple of days .
M	the paintballing was outdoor rather_than indoor with 00_euros extra costs each for an overall and enough paintballs to last everyone the games .
F	an_hour and a half later i got a phone_call from the subcontracting company saying he had been sent by talktalk to an address in carlisle !
M	that is not until monday 0st july
F	i ordered three items online in my latest order .
M	wonderful service & cheap too !
F	cpw and geek squad said i should have cancelled it after the 0_weeks but i did not know i had been signed_up .
F	ok i had to accept that .
M	so , after ignoring my other emails in which i mentioned taking_legal_action , i have replied to this latest email from conrad at webuy . com by reitterating this line of action wil proceed as of 0 . 00am tommorow 00th of march if the situation is unresolved by 0 . 00pm today .
F	i was and am so worried .
F	so good !
M	the pc itself is superb - exactly as specified , and ready to go out of the box .
M	she contacted myself and her father to tell us that the rac have refused to come out as it is classed_as an accident and not a breakdown .
F	always excellent value and service .
M	i am also nearly_£_00 out of pocket on the deal
F	thanks very much :_d
M	however , i can '_t understand how they can be understaffed on busy days , especially on the the service desk which is always the busiest part of the store .
M	why was i given the option when i order it to have it delivered to another address if this is not possible .
F	here is my letter to hammonds sent 0_weeks_ago - still no reply or even acknowledgement , also no allen_key which was apparently posted 0_weeks_ago as the senior fitter refused to give it to me !!
F	i see you have replied to some of the reviews on here iflorist and wondered_if you would be courteous enough to do the same for me as i have exhausted every other method of trying to make contact with you !
M	post was superb , and easy to track .
F	these capsules just do not work well in my nespresso latissimo machine .
M	!
M	keep it up debs , especially in this competitive time with unethical shops around you .
M	either they had been damaged in transit , or were old stock .
M	this is by far the worst on line trader i have ever_dealt_with to the point i have cancelled my order .
F	since then nothing .
F	sent for a special reason and the recipient thrilled with display
M	after looking for this deck oil prices varied locally from £_00_-£_00 but prices from wood_finishes direct were a lot better , add in timed next_day delivery and brilliant communication and you literally couldn_'_t ask for more .
M	i ordered my glasses and received them in 0 separate lots .
F	nespresso collect the capsules back from you and as i didn_'_t have any means of recycling from you they went in the council plastic recycle bag .
M	only set me £ 0 for me phone , feel like i been robbed for my chains !
M	offices shut by time delivered so not able to get replacement .
F	it seemed like my order had gone_through , i had entered all of my card information .
M	i can '_t beleive that people want to let each other know what they are having for breakfast or what they are wearing .
F	the adverts led me to believe that the visual pane would be wide and unfortunately the reading magnification is quite weak in comparison to my reading_glasses that i got 0_months before from the opticians .
M	the laptop is now very wizzy !!
F	they did not phone me to inform_me of this !
M	ordered on a sunday and delivery took 00 days which was disappointing but when i moaned about it they explained that there had an a error in dispatch they they refunded delivery cost which was great effort at customer service
M	booked and paid for an oil and filter_change online , rang to ask best time to call in for it doing and was told that my local halifax branch would not honour the booking even_though i had already paid online . he stated to buy the oil in would cost too much therefore they would not do the job !.
M	i ordered a soft cervical collar from physioroom primarily_because of the range of fittings offered .
F	great product , easy purchase , terrific price .
M	however the delivery driver thought it was acceptable to hammer on the door and ring the doorbell repeatedly until someone answered , because it was raining a bit outside , thus waking the baby who had just been tucked in for a sleep .
M	cex are a very poor company and im going to make it my mission to make_sure everybody knows of their business_practices .
F	it was a good experience expected more money for the phone thought
M	can '_t fault the service , this was the 0nd time using the service ( once in uk and once in aus ) and i would use again .
M	pissedconsumer . com is on a par with some seedy sex sites , or other such highly obnoxious internet experiences .
F	and in the back !
F	i then emailed another complaint to the same email address as i was not going to make the mistake of calling them .
M	it '_s a sham that a company can just report the negative_reviews and have them taken off
F	easy to order & calendar_clock was delivered ahead of schedule .
M	basic / old furnishings
M	they stated the order had been dispatched a few_days earlier and it did arrive via_royal_mail later that day .
F	i was informed that as i hadn_'_t paid the fee for first_class postage i could wait up to 0_weeks for delivery .
M	the webiste is pretty clear and easy to use .
M	!
M	as stated before , medicanimal is thoroughly_recommended by myself , offering an
M	the dryer was replaced quickly but not on the day that suited me best , i think when errors like this are made the company should have a fast track replacement service .
M	they added it to the credit_card when adding the tank of fuel .
F	i was told that this service would not be available for collection , which could take place any time between 0 . 00 an 00 . 00 .
F	i have never_heard such crap from a courier .
M	we could see it and it seem to stay there for ages .
F	i booked the flight from jersey to gatwick for 0 adults traveling in may and after printing out the confirmation i realized that my baggage was not included only hand_luggage .
M	i had never dropped them or subjected them to undue_stress .
M	it took many many emails and a conversation with a director before several issues were resolved with one of my experiences .
F	so they haven_'_t even been packaged , let_alone sent out !
F	00 / 00 for honesty though .
F	my on line buying experience was spoilt by the delivery service .
F	i know long have to worry_about losing my phone .
F	quick processing , good communication but sadly delivery meant boxes were left in porch - split with cat_litter everywhere .
F	now they ' re up i am really pleased with them , however would think_twice regarding buying from this company again .
F	would recommend to anyone .
M	i came looking for a certain onkyo av_receiver and although it was not available , i was readily upgraded to the next model for a very fair price .
F	it was on sale but still came to £_00 .
M	:)
F	i had to chase them to get an answer .
M	most of the time i '_m able to connect to a server in the region that i want to .
M	she did get them and liked them but the edge was lost due to the lateness .
F	i notice three_weeks_later that the web_site has not changed .
F	☺️
M	bert morris
F	tracking predicted time of arrival within a one hour_timeslot - well impressed .
M	i was told to go home and he would be there by 0am .
F	i enjoy wearing my new sunglasses and can recommend this company as the quality of the product was great .
F	i asked for and idea of how long i would possibly wait for an_appointment once the part is in and he said " about 0 or 0_days " ( in other words how long is a piece of string .
F	my lingerie was very sexy and fitted , so i threw out the packaging to all my products , not thinking for one minute that my two other items were not going to work .
F	quick and efficient .
M	perhaps he didn_'_t know ?
M	and the stand was a full £_00 cheaper at merlin than anywhere_else !
M	i will never buy from them again .
M	i balked a little at the £ 0 +_vat but was told that was because it was next_day delivery , so reluctantly i sucked it up .
F	update
F	tsince then we have been useing there hayes middx stores for years_now .
M	i was looking for a hostel in paris at 00pm .
M	thx for having it all pre_- tuned which helped on set_up .
F	i booked a sleeper ticket , fully expecting this to be a sleeper berth ( including indicating my gender ).
M	most florists deliver flower bouquets in water to keep them fresh but these weren_'_t in water either so had dried out a bit by the time i gave them to my wife .
F	i like the way you can get all your smellies under one roof and there is no delivery to pay .
M	still_awaiting delivery of our cotbed .
M	however , i had paid an additional £ 0 for next_day delivery as i needed the part quickly so the misses didn_'_t run out of things to do !
F	the price was excellent , as was the very quick delivery .
M	i purchased two jackets from brook_taverner but realised that i wanted a slightly_different style .
F	pc_specialist was recommended to me by a good friend who purchased a desktop_pc a couple of years_ago and was able to give me the benefit of his experience with pc_specialist .
F	the process of putting in my personal photos was easy and the finished card , when it arrived , was superb .
F	i will enjoy the flower none the less .
F	well_done !
M	highly_recommended .
M	this rendered the rate worse than those offering free delivery
M	the service was some what rushed and we got the feeling that we an inconvenience to the cabin_crew , they would have been happier if the business class cabin would have been empty .
F	thank_you very much .
M	i had an electronic copy of the checklist which i scanned in on the photocopier at work .
F	or loreena mckennitt ?
M	orderded a jacket on wednesday arrived next_day
F	it all seemed to be going so well .
M	i saved £_00 . 00 compared to the high_street and they arrived in seven_days from ordering .
M	got no calls and no card .
M	after trying to sort it out with customer_services i just got fobbed_off with with " we have made 0 attempts so i will now have to collect " !
F	so i ordered it & it came , nice & shiny & new but no insert !!!
F	i have entered manually .
M	i ordered and paid for 0 tyres for my brother to be installed at garage in necastle .
F	we particularly chose this pump as it said it was suitable for dirty water , but maybe not that dirty
M	the car_hire experience best so_far .
M	would certainly purchase from heatandplumb again .
F	the products i buy - mostly for jewellery_making - are top quality and the selection is so vast !
F	would be reluctant to use again .
F	overall a very satisfactory transaction .
F	if only they had told me earlier i would have arranged to buy flowers from somewhere_else .
M	i purchased a 0 day delivery but it took them 0 days , i called there help line on 00th_june at 00 :_00pm they promised me a refund as a goodwill within 0 days , they have failed twice on their promise 0 day delivery slot and another for a refund
F	all delicate items ( tv etc ) were wrapped and secured so there was nothing to worry_about .
F	delivered as promised .
M	i suspect the items were out of stock but they won_'_t admit a flaw in their ' live ' online stock system .
M	the car was small , diesel and economical so the empty_tank policy is a money making game for the rental company .
F	so fast to help and please .
F	quick reliable and cheap !
F	that '_s almost three_months with no communication whatsoever !!
M	i '_ve been with hsbc since it was midland bank plc !
M	!
M	arrived within 0 working_days .
F	the actual procedure was ok , not painful although quite unpleasant , but initially i could see pretty well .
M	i '_ve been wearing_contacts for years but found going to the high_st , to get them a hassle as i '_m often too_busy .
F	i wish i had never gone to 0 but they weren_'_t prepared to reduce payments or increase my plan and i am stuck with them for 0 years - it would cost almost the same to leave as it would to stay - the only discount being 0 %.
M	initially , pixmania apologised and sent they ' d send out a uk adapter .
M	overall i cannot_fault the prompt friendly and affordable service i received .
F	this was when using an ipad , i have not tried on windows .
F	when paying so much this is not acceptable .
M	it causes no end of problems as we live on a busy a - road and we have to move cars around to gain_access to the tank .
F	when it was delivered i was very disappointed with the poor quality of the products and a missing collar .
F	generally above_average product quality , however if i buy a laptop with no dead pixel guarantee , it doesn_'_t mean they should send me one that was probably rejected by someone_else the screen being so bad .
F	i sent an_email to say i had received something different to what i had ordered and they got back to me within a couple of hours , however they wanted a photo of the bags before they could help me but i was out and my phone is not reliable for sending emails so therefore i couldn_'_t send a picture until i had access to the internet .
M	i had pre_- paid and had printed out my booking form but it said details would be forwarded , but they weren_'_t .
F	so straight after the assembly i had to lock the costume away in a cupboard and it won_'_t be seeing the light of day again .
M	they arrived with a super slim label on them and were advertised on the website as slim_fit .
M	now ive been waiting for a cheaque that was posted 0 days ago & i still_havent recieved it .
F	was very pleased with the compare the market however what a shame the affilated parties used by compare holiday money failed to communicate , deliver on time and didn_'_t deliver the expected level of customer service , very different experience to the level of service from compare the market
M	i then had a call from rajapack and they told me they were sorry and there was a mistake they took my card_details to refund one of my payments onto my card .
M	have purchased two games from cdkeys . com . au
F	the staff at the chorley branch were friendly and knowledgeable , without putting any pressure on me .
M	i tried to explain to their head_office that i could easily cancel the booking without_any charge and book with hotels . com and save myself at_least £_00 .
F	considering that the diet coke was coming from the draught that isn_'_t expensive for your company to purchase , what is the price mark up ( profit )?
M	having tried a couple of other placed to be told the 0 drawer set was out of stock i tried this company .
F	!
M	well , i made the same mistake , not once , but twice , will i never learn .
F	bitesizedeals customer_services have not yet got back to me about my complaint .
M	kiwi fit came to change the tyres in our car at a time that suited_us .
F	now i take it to facebook .
M	i would tread with great care if you are thinking of buying through this website .
M	i have been shopping on the internet for years and this has to be the worst purchasing experience to date .
M	call them back to be told the bed is now discontinued .
F	although my experience with the company thus_far was awful i must_say ashley turned it around :) i would recomend the company as the prices are very good but i would suggest cover as parcels do get lost and you wont get the value of the products unless your covered .
F	the card was wonderful too !
F	otherwise very happy with the watch and the price i got it for !
F	ordering process was straightforward , even with a prescription .
M	i duly provided that , received acknowledgement from customer service and then the next_day was informed that my order had been cancelled on the grounds that i had not provided the necessary_information .
F	stop this nonsence and just give us straight_forward parking price and stop ripping us off
M	have to wait and see !
F	thank_you !
F	we won_'_t be booking again with the company , as the service wasn_'_t satisfactory .
M	five times the effort to chase delivery as to make the purchase - massive waste of my time and effort !!
F	i was expecting it in a few_days and it came the next_day !
F	as they are very quick at sending goods out .
M	by using click and collect you choose when to pick_up your order .
F	this is the second time i have ordered through rawk and again was left very very satisfied .
F	since i was frustrated i sent a complaint to city_link ( via_e_- mail ) and i ’_m still_waiting for a response from them .
M	all my emails and questions were promptly answered within a couple of hours , there was plenty of advice as to which lens to select and all the staff that i dealt_with were very personable , friendly and knowledgeable .
M	what they haven_'_t told you is that it was with those settings that it went off with a bang when " expert " roy plugged it tin to test it .
F	order - e000000000
M	anyway , they re - scheduled collection for the next_day and , once again i arranged time off work to wait in for them .
M	“ headlamp aim ”
F	we had to " persuade " them to do so
M	really frustrating when you spend over £_000 and the next_day you could of got £_00 off .
M	easy to use website .
F	i ordered a hydrangea aspera ' hot_chocolate ' it arrived quickly and well_packaged , that accounts for the one star .
F	i bought two_pairs of glasses .
M	overall , a good experience for them to see places they have only read about .
M	ordered item at 0 . 00pm , it was on my doorstep at 0 . 00am the following_morning .
M	i was told that it might not be perfect and its not .
M	i '_ll be wary to order online again , unless it is just one single item .
F	easy to use site and very fast delivery service , i ordered it at 00am on wednesday and it arrived the next_day at 0 . 00am .
F	we both work and a weekend away would have been great as my son thought .
F	my conclusion ?
F	the gift didn_’_t turn_up
F	know you can '_t maybe solve it , but why do you attract massive customers with trolleys laden with junk food and huge loaves of bread ?
F	i have already_recommended this florist to other friends here in nz for deliveries back home in the uk :) excellent .
F	the £ 0 voucher is too long for the card it came in .
F	i recently_purchased a dark_green hoodie online .
M	quick and easy to book and collect .
M	had available prior to choosing the one i ordered .
M	this seems an offer to review a heater i ordered , but as it turns_out not to be in stock , and it is likely to be another couple of weeks before i might receive it , i really can ` t comment on it !
F	i have changed my star_rating from 0 to 0 .
F	very difficult to speak to anyone after purchase .
M	one item was a monitor .
F	there has to be a catch - but there isn_'_t .
F	even in emergencies nothing !
F	would not recommend this site to anyone .
F	i only found this out when i went into their delivery policy when the goods didn_'_t arrive the next_day !!
F	ordered and arrived the next_day even at christmas time
M	after a chat with a friend of mine and abit of messing on the webb , bingo !
M	to be honest i don_'_t think the royal_mail price increase for small items has helped the matter .
M	need to make porridge on a gas ring , all non - stick fails and deposits black bits in my efforts , so went with his and hers 0 . 0 l saucepans .
F	update_: i was going to give them a chance but after them ignoring all my e_-_mails which i sent to support , sales & payments i have now placed a dispute via_paypal people beware dont buy from these con men !
F	the proof of a company with good customer service is not in the prices on offer or how quickly things get delivered , but in how they deal with customer complaints - poor poor poor service ( a search of other online reviews demonstrates i '_m not the only one who thinks so ).
F	it is difficult to summarise my complaint because it is lengthy and i have now put this in writing in full to e_bookers .
F	i '_ve not been able to make calls everytime that i '_ve wanted to , they just won_'_t connect .
M	had to go to royal_mail depot to find out it wasnt there wasted time and petrol .
F	we live outside of the uk and had some problems sourcing the products and medicines we required .
M	ebay buyer blaming me for damage .
M	despite this , they delivered the replacements on the thursday when no one was in .
F	all ok but when i needed to make an_amendment i was initially told by customer_services it wasn_'_t possible and the advisor didn_'_t know the reason_why !
F	even when i got the it wasn_'_t as_described on the the internet .
M	you ' re already now down to six hours paid working time if you could manage that speed !
M	wasted day and no communication to let us know the situation .
M	they never fixed the probelm after 0 weks and 0 engineers and i will never use them again .
F	would highly_recommend this company .
M	reasonable compared to their renewal fees .
F	!
F	when i placed the order , it was meant to come with a free ' naked rub ', but this did not arrive .
F	we were very pleased when we arrived at our hotel as it was more than what we expected as we had booked it without_seeing it first .
M	shop with confidence here .
M	would of gone to my own chemist if i knew it was going to take 00_hours
F	unfortunately , the 0 boxes that the products came in were all damaged .
M	so to add_insult to injury i have to wait a possible 00days for my phone to be returned , doesnt quite seem like straight_away to me .
M	my girlfriend was so happy !
M	the policy was very simple to set_up and very competitively_priced .
M	was meant to be here 0 days ago so i rang earlier and asked what is going on , they said they had only just received it from supplier and they will deliver it tmw .
F	daughter is thrilled with the bed .
M	as many sites where you buy online client need to subscribe to terms and conditions which are , as usual , too long to read thoroughly .
M	kids don_'_t know what to watch first .
F	i am tempted into buying another when i can , or , maybe two , they are such good value .
M	ordered tickets on wednesday and got them the following_day via_recorded delivery , would recommend this company
F	never again !
M	now , there is a story here because the undermount sink manufacturer has a template on its website and this was sent to worktop_express .
F	however , locked me out when i got to the payment page and when i went back in price had gone up by 00 %.
F	good service
F	i chased when no news that week and was told then the order was not available .
M	service is simple , great choice of stock even older machines , and i recommend them to anybody .
F	i thought the ordering process was brilliant .
F	in addition , i '_ve had an inflamed tendon in my shoulder for a couple of years which has never healed properly and ever_since using the memory_foam pillow there are some days i don_'_t even feel any pain and it now seems to be healing nicely .
F	we were already in london and the restaurant was certainly not shut ( as they claimed ) when we walked past it earlier . i am not suggesting they were not being honest just stating our experience . we then had empty stomachs and in an attempt to still enjoy a meal we had promised ourselves had to pay elsewhere . that in itself is not wowchers fault but for me it should have been food for thought .
M	i called on friday and it went through to answerphone .
M	but good news ; the hose ordered was not available so a better quality alternative was quickly despatched at no extra_cost .
F	we were very pleased with the quality , when we eventually recieved them .
F	we then had to call them again and they said it was too_big to deliver to the post_office .
F	website is easy to navigate and the home_trial service is awesome .
M	my driving_licence was sufficient .
M	there is a glowing write up in their brochure for polycarbonate sheeting but no mention of how long the material should last .
M	he answered all our questions even ones that may have sounded silly .
M	so by all means , myprotein products are great . but order your stuff a month in advance , or roll the dice with their stock / delivery promises
F	i would definately use them again as the display was very unusual and were worth the money .
M	can '_t be_beaten on price or service . will_definitely be using again !
F	they never arrived .
F	on the whole , i like this company and all of my transactions with them have gone_smoothly .
M	i '_m having real trouble deciding who is worst - they ' re just both so terrible .
M	0 .
M	would not recommend at all
F	would definitely use again thank_you
F	we were asked to pay a deposit of over_£ 0000 which we did and then to pay the full_amount once the order was being placed .
F	finally no reduction on bill or anything complimentary , really bad service / food / place .
M	thank_you .
F	they never ever break anything and that my goods were never missing - nothing ever went wrong in his warehouse !
F	get better for less at a decent supermarket .
F	however when it was delivered we were not in and it was left with a neighbour , there was nothing put through our door to say they had tried to deliver and no details to say where it had been left .
F	chemist_direct provided a brilliant service .
M	i was greeted_by donna turner and was pleasantly_surprised by her understanding and general attitude .
F	!
F	i am £_000 out of pocket with no hope of making a claim .
F	this might be a problem if you have younger_children who are in bed earlier_than this .
M	i paid via_paypal and was instantly able to view my new simcity serial_number , i entered the code in the origin console under the ' redeem product ' tab and began downloading the full version of the game .
M	it wouldn_'_t take them long to update the site so the watches that aren_'_t eligible are listed as such though , so read what you what into the way they present their refund policy .
F	after waiting 00_mins for my call to be answered i eventually was given a collection date of this coming thursday .
M	phew .
M	on the 00th , a hand_written sign is placed outside the depot sayin " no collections today ", if you walked up to the depot the manager of the depot would try to put you off by saying there is a 0 hour wait , looking at the queue of 00 people and the number that walked_away his detering tactics were working .
M	excellent advice given on the website coupled_with some of the most_important in a gentlemans wash bag .
F	good quality products but if anything_goes_wrong with your order then i personally found the person_who dealt_with me to be disrespectful and suffering a god complex .
F	plus having the tracking on my parcel made it easier .
M	every time i go to sigma_sport i am met with a warm_welcome , somebody is always to hand with advice and there is nothing that is to much_trouble .
M	we ordered half a dozen bulbs needed for replacements in our new house .
M	i would have been better doing that rather_than spending a not insignificant sum for a product that i could have quite easily got for £_00_-£_00 .
F	was very disappointed the flowers displayed looked lovely but when they finally arrived they looked as if the day had been to much for them they didn_'_t arrive until the evening so that didn_'_t help matters these were ordered well in_advance 0 / 0 / 00 unfortunately they looked like a last_minute decision and for £_00 spend a great disappointment all_round
F	i use many car_hire_companies ( at_least 0 a month ) and this organisation has poor customer service , unclear documentation and are generally underhand and difficult to deal with .
F	money very well spent !
F	i needed a free giveaway for an_exhibition i am attending , but also want to give the exhibiting franchisors some information about my company .
M	the price compared to everywhere_else was very pleasing and does not sacrifice anything because of this .
F	not impressed
M	at the end of the day that my delivery was expected , i still hadn_'_t received my package but it had already been signed for .
M	there was a lot of options so took awhile to sort through , but that '_s mostly because i wasn_'_t looking for anything specific .
F	i feel the return of items is fiddly and discouraging .
F	refused to refund me till items were returned to them via their courier ( even_though i never actually recieved them !!!!!)
M	the cabin was cool clean and comfortable but no soap_dispenser in the shower only at the sink made showering difficult , the cabins could do with some better quality pillows .
M	i will_deff use them again as i belive this was a one off .
F	i have ordered 0 times over the last 0 years .
F	i also think having to sign for deliveries puts people off buying on line .
M	unable to successfully receive an item i ordered
F	i get the impression that this is not the type of company that will take my complaints and concerns on board and refund my money though .
M	of course some airlines are far better_than others .
F	i explained my issue , she took the details over the phone and sent me my confirmations straight back .
F	i subsequently attempted to call up and speak to someone about my booking .
M	my company is based on the isle of man and we ship all our larger_parcels through interparcel .
F	will definitely recommend to others !
M	buying from the site is simple and quick and the invoicing process is slick and professional .
M	great service .
M	so , if you like to be onto their " care " team for hours at a time , get nowhere , suffer a poor and expensive service , and get insulted with the compensation you are offered , then bt is the best choice for you !
F	stunning dress !
M	but - slow .
F	bubble_wrap - quick and efficient service will buy from them again
F	worst service ever .
F	!
F	i ordered , they delivered .
F	waiting 0_months for a bean_bag is not acceptable and no communication or even a simple apology and explanation , no to mention no keeping customers up to date on their order
M	very happy
M	would suggest that the weight of this package was way over the maximum safe working load .
M	the laptop runs warm whilst gaming so a cooling pad is recommended .
M	however , direct from 0 for instance , and it '_s ' ooooh that '_s prohibited '.

M	so i guess that was my bad_luck .

F	my previous_purchases ( and there have been many !)

M	just wanted to support a uk maker .
F	i was told storagemart was the best place for my belongings .

M	how difficult is it to say that only 00 will be delivered and that 00 will need to be delivered before you get your order and this may be several weeks down the line .
F	they were both technically well informed when i needed assistance with a problem that i had .
F	i order the part on the internet was later phoned as payment hadnt gone_through & paid_extra for next_day delivery .
M	great service today from emily at online_chat , who handled my issue in a pleasant and professional_manner

F	i will not recommend this product , it is not great .
F	i paid via_paypal and instantly received an_email receipt from paypal although my groupon account was saying that payment was unsuccessful .
M	so a mixed review here .
M	totally_unreliable
M	not only did rentalcars . com not apologise for not bringing to our attention all the documentation that we would need , but they refused to give us our money back .
M	if i '_m to return , ( a big if ) i '_ll have to be cautious not to make wrongful purchases as they will deducted a whopping amount for returns .
F	mainly_because their prices have gone up sooo_much since i got my first pair & also because they ' re now very much into designer names frames :-( rather_than good basic frames at good basic prices !
F	the corn meal lid was crushed partially and some had leaked out .
M	i needed a replacement reflector and this store had just what i required .
F	as another_reviewer has already noted , one drawback of using holidayautos is that you may end up with a car from goldcar .

M	i was impressed until he said the price 00 quid !
M	seeing as this was my first_outing i did notice some tuxedos that looked much_better but they were probably also more_expensive .
M	sky now got seriously involved so a resolution should be , i hope quick .
F	i also made a rich chocolate buttercream - the chocolate created a light full flavoured frosting that piped perfectly .
F	could not believe_how fast and efficient the service was , communication was excellent and flowers were beautiful .
M	later that day i received a dispatch note from gb_posters , which i found a bit_confusing , as it was the fist such note i had received , but all the same i waited_until the next_day to see what arrived .
F	the quality of materials used are first_rate !
F	he said he did not know what the problem was so could not order a part .
F	i have recently_purchased rosehip_tablets and was very disappointed to only receive one bottle whereas i have always had the bogof_offer .
M	i recently_bought a shower_enclosure which was missing the door_seal .
M	the quality is great and delivery is always within a day or two .
F	and , then the click and position upright mechanism to convert to a sofa stopped_working .
M	would recommend products but not the pathetic delivery service .
M	now i had it , i will now give sainsbury a chance and suggest everybody_else does the same .
F	i mean i '_m_sure if you wanted to post an item and it end up at completely the wrong_address then they are great .
F	i then rang argos headoffice only to get lipservice appoilges and nothing else .
M	called their 00p_per min ' helpline ' - told that there is a problem .
M	hi , i have always found skyparksecure to be friendly and efficient .
F	later that day i recieved an_email_saying they would not deliver because item ' would not be ready ' and it would need to be delivered a week_later .
F	i got them to send me a dispute form as i have wasted enough time calling redhill , who will just lie and lie again to you as i have found out by reading your reviews today .
M	however at times the create vibrations sounds which defeats the objective of them .
F	they went out of there way to get the order right and under alot of pressure from me .
M	although the packaging was not damaged the surface of the corotile was damaged on the top sheet and the odd edge on the remainder .
M	april 0nd : received email_confirming delivery due 0rd_april
M	get the phone you want , pay cash and get a pay as you go sim from any network it doesn_'_t matter just don_'_t get an o0 pay monthly package because you will regret it .
F	couldn_'_t_believe_how quickly it arrived and very helpful driver
M	they price match on the fly and have all the products you need .
F	the main difficulty when booking in_advance from outside of the uk is the requirement to enter a car make and registration when this won_'_t be known until the car is hired much closer to the time of travel .
M	will not be using it ever again .
M	amazing and will_definitely be using them again in the near_future .
M	so after 0 phone_calls couple of bank transer i was back to squar one with a lost of $_00

M	it would be good to have a dedicated area for prepaid cars .
F	thank_you so much .

M	yodel ( the courier ) have given us problems before when they lost some mobiles we ordered in transit , and i recommend all companies stop using them .
M	fast despatch , excellent communication , great item
F	i have just ordered more tulips which arrived wednesday 0th_may .
M	other than those things , customer service is good and was prompt .
M	you may wish to reconsider your courier apc , what a shower of s -- t !!
F	they would not give me my money back or let it be used towards another group on ( as some other_companies do ) they may as well have robbed me as they have my money for nothing at all .
F	rude and incompetent .
F	emailed them 0_days ago telling them they had 0_days to sort it or i would be moving supplier .
M	should have bought it ages_ago , it makes all the difference to the look of the caravan .
M	my order with taunton_leisure was placed late evening .

M	the service was perfect .
F	i ordered some shoes , nowhere on the website did it say they weren_'_t in stock .
F	the bouquet is nice but the roses are not looking fresh and the crysanthamums are purple not red which was not at all as_described .
F	first time booking service .
M	seemed to offer slightly better level of cover than the other_companies .
F	then an_email arrived about the pair i returned and £ 0 . 00 had been deducted for postage .
F	well this is also unacceptable - refunds do not take that long these days - i know i have my own business .
F	with lenstore i almost always receive them within 0_days .
F	good quality , in one shop , speedy and will return
F	£ 0 and a bit for a tub of peanut_butter is fairly expensive so i probably_won_'_t be ordering it again in a hurry , but the service and delivery is good .
M	order sent 00 feb , payment taken from card , followed up email , still heard_nothing .
M	while the product remains good , i would urge the company to improve communication with buyers and to notify of dispatch , with parcel tracking_information .
M	they explained the options in a simple way that gave_me confidence that i could now make an informed and balanced decision .
M	there are other oddities , but i would use the site again , for it does that first bit of the process very well and know i know some of the quirks ( there are more i can '_t remember ) i feel_comfortable using the service again .
F	very good quality product and company .
F	my first complaint is that only two attempted delivery notes had been left in the mail , but the last of them said it had been the third delivery attempt .

F	he abruptly stated :” i ’ ve had enough of you today , you can deal with the office ”.
F	great contacts !!
F	i explained to the argos shop assistant that i didn_'_t want the item and wanted to return it but was told that ebay items had to be returned via the supplier and that they were just acting as a collection_point only .
M	not as good as p_& o in terms of shopping / food / on - board entertainment but what there is is similarly over - priced and underwhelming .
M	we feel that so_far we have paid more than enough for their below diy skilled installation !
F	i thought it was going to cost me £_00 to get my smart car key working again ( it can '_t be used manually ) but a quick look on this site , checked the battery serial_number , 0 batteries ordered for less_than a fiver including p_&_p and now my spare_key has a new battery as well .

F	it was quite high up and am not good at that too .

M	delivery was a bit_slow and misleading - 0 - 0 working_days became two_weeks , and status_updates didn_'_t help .
F	i just hang up it didn_'_t make_sense keep talking to that useless woman .

F	one thing broken or missing in a large order - perhaps , but not this much_trouble .
M	as an it professional myself i am more than aware that these failures occur from time to time and cannot often be helped but i was disappointed by the fact that on asking the online advisor if he was able to find out a rough eta for the website to be back up due to the fact that i wished to use an online - only discount_voucher he was unable to help in any way other than suggesting that i restarted my internet_explorer session which coincidentally would have cut_off my chat_session without actually resolving a server issue at national_tyres end .
M	so much for making it easier and cheaper by going online .
F	it sits in my kitchen the centre piece of attention .
F	have emailed back twice with no answer .
M	when it was time to return to our vehicle , the stairs became very congested , the doors from the staircase b at 0g level would not open , vehicles could be heard starting up out on the car deck , some passengers became frightened , there was an attempt to return to the upper decks , this was met with a surge of people coming down , it was dangerous and frightening , there were no dfds staff to be seen and no announcements made , eventually the doors did open temporarily letting some passengers out onto the deck , they then locked up again , more passengers were arriving by lift there was nowhere for them to go , our party was split up , it was a frightening experience .

F	waited for weeks to get my order , then got the wrong order and now i '_ve got to prove they have sent me the wrong glasses before i get the pair i '_ve paid for months_ago !

F	". sky : " oh the system doesn_'_t work like like that .

F	i had chosen a sat for delivery as i work during weekdays .
M	it was very irritating not being_able to find the information i needed on the site .
M	initial estimate of £_00 seemed very good indeed compared to other 0rd_party companies , however i then received an email to say that it had ' less_than 0 scratches on the front ' and decreased the value to £_00 . 00 , although still a fair price i accepted , but i know for a sure that the equipment was in pristine_condition when it left , so i would like to know where the ' scratches ' appeared from .
F	it is a long time since i have felt so angry !
F	i had no email either .

M	andrew apologised and said i would be given a full_refund and if by chance it transpired the records had been despatched and then belatedly arrived they would be mine to keep - this was a very nice_gesture and the full_refund hit my account yesterday .

F	don_'_t touch them with a bargepole .
F	which was just too long for my purposes .
F	escapade would be my first choice for fancy_dress , and i have already_recommended to many guests of an_upcoming fancy_dress_party .

F	so , not perfect but just about ok !
M	the laptop that arrived must have been an old one which was extremely large and heavy .
F	we have not been to london as a couple before and don_'_t know the area .
F	not what i '_d expect from £_00 - not satisfied .
F	they were very knowledgeable and very helpful to us pensioners !!!!
F	friendly advice over the phone .
M	i think their customer appreciation stinks and if i could i would rate this company as zero , but unfortunately the lowest score i can give them is a 0 .
F	have used them three_times already .
F	thick at the top rail ( which needed extra nails due to them being loose ) and only 00mm !!
M	all was routine except that after driving away i found an empty drink bottle rolling around the floor along with an empty samosa bag .
F	a little_disappointing and it would put me off ordering again .
F	i also received the vase which i ordered and it complimented the flowers perfectly .
M	i did not want to send the chair back .
M	this situation is totally_unacceptable and if i do not get a refund soon i will look into taking some legal_action_against them , just out of principle .
F	would '_ve complained but actually couldn_'_t be bother - at_least they got there at the right time which is the only plus point really
F	eventually we have up i am still_waiting for another person to call me back - we '_ll see ???
M	ellis_brigham could have refunded me there and then and i wouldn_'_t have suffered on my trip .
F	the goods that i ordered were fine and arrived in a reasonable time .
F	put order on 00 / dec /_0000 .
M	sadly a pretty_useless company .
M	but that '_s no fault of them .
M	still missing one item .
F	i am still_waiting for a proper reply and a refund of the cost of the missing chocolates .
M	ordered on saturday .
F	i have stopped using interparcel for international_shipments as i feel it '_s too much of a risk .
M	the goods sat in the tnt depot for 0_weeks and in the meantime the packaging was desecrated .
M	support_belt was delivered very quickly and was as_described .
M	and began to get uptight .
M	i was looking for a particular spirit .
M	stayed at the best_western senator , so all attractions were quite close and most_important , very close to the grand bazaar !
M	so i guess the answer is yes , i am gullible to believe that this company are professional and honest .
F	very quick service and delivery very happy with the product will use your service again thank_you
M	just be aware when ordering !
M	when order came , driver wanted me to sign before he had taken the goods off the lorry without_any inspection .
M	i would have no_hesitation in using againg or recommending .
F	whatever you want is likely to be in the catelogue and there is free_postage .
M	the comments on site encouraged me to order and i am not disappointed .
F	delivery was quick but inside packaging was not protective enough and two of the screw plastic lids were broken , i assume from the trip .
F	probably the best place to buy pens etc .
F	staff that seem to listen and care and don_'_t hide_behind impersonal emails like some other internet companies .
F	as it was a saturday , there was no - one around in the wood 0u office to answer my calls ( or at the freight service ) and so i had waited in all day for nothing ( and i paid £_00 for saturday delivery ).
M	i have pearl_izumi and i have cycleclothinguk .
M	just awaiting the replacement album and fingers_crossed .
M	really quick and reliable service would recommend to anyone
F	would check this website first if i need something_else .
F	i have been waiting for an entire week for them to refund my money , which they had no_problems debiting from my credit_card account straight_away .
F	will not order from or recomend them again .
M	you policy seems against buisness ?
M	website great , products and prices are great , delivery tracking and delivery excellent .
M	i will not be buying from them again .
F	thought it was to late but items were here within 0_days fantastic just try you won_'_t be disappointed promise .
M	i picked this up but on sat when no - one was there to stop the delivery .
M	read the other review and therefore made up my mind to go with company_formations 000 instead of the one my friend recommended me .
F	i have ordered on two occasions recently , but on both_occasions have recieved a telephone_call informing_me that one of the items ordered was not in stock .
M	really simple web_site .
M	the online web_site made this very easy .
F	it '_s honestly beyond_belief .
M	phone first , i '_ve been pretty impressed so_far wti the service i '_ve received .
F	anyway . cheap and fast for the wormers but go elsewhere for your advice !
M	i would definitely recommend juno as your first stop if your looking to purchase vinyl whether it '_s current or something more specialised .
F	loved my frames so much that i just had them reglazed !
M	photobook quality ok . gadget_show made reference to qr_codes ( to link to your videos ).
M	advertise cheap flights however the baggage excess gets you and when you have a problem the company dont want to know with an overseas customer service centre which costs a fortune to call
M	no confidence in this company .
F	the trees have now been in the garden for a few_days and are in excellent condition and shooting new leaves already .
F	everything seems to be in order .
M	can '_t recommend highly_enough .
M	a new feature i would love to see is classrooms .
F	update - ( may_0000 ) - one year on and after recently talking to the victorinox uk distributor i received a telephone_call from the owner of swisstool and a subsequent refund into my bank_account .
M	i booked through cruise . com and the cruise was cancelled and they said it was because i was british
M	this also included unexpected extra costs as we had received new invoices but they were so unclear that we weren_'_t able to follow the changes in the charges .
M	i got my memory the next_day !
M	thanks .
M	i bought this desk which was delivered in perfect_condition in two_days .
M	the outer_box , the panasonic box and the polystyrene packaging within were all damaged on one corner - it looked as though the complete parcel had been dropped on its corner .
M	found lenstore after a bit of web research and they seemed both very professional and very competitively_priced .
F	i would like to say i am fed_up of transactions taken by pay_pal and then
M	rapid delivery and good product
F	i wanted to reply to a comment that was put on my review and i have been unable to do this unless i log_into facebook .
F	i needed to be informed before i bought it that it was not in stock so i could order elsewhere .
F	basically everyhting was quite efficient , boarding , loading , unloading etc .
M	guess_what they charged me for fuel .?
M	i ordered online from them before and they were out of stock on the item , but the friendly and personal apology i received on that occasion led me to give them another chance .
M	highly_recommend this company .
M	!
F	delivery is always fast and their website very easy to use and the ability to look back to previous_orders really helps .
M	i had to go through my bills each_month an check properly . just to see where they will charge me extra !
M	i found a wide_range of solutions on their site that were ideal and very reasonably_priced .
F	the full_amount to pay should have been shown before submitting , not after !
M	and cracking customer service when required .
M	you really must use this site it is the best service ever and all prices are reasonable
F	reported back to stoneacre who refuse to foot the bill because apparently the vauxhall garage had no right to fix the cd_player .
M	very easy and simple to use money returned within a 0 days of sending the phone off
M	!.
F	thank_you .
M	i was pleased with the products and prices but the time between ordering and delivery was 0_weeks which was too far long .
M	so we paid a fortune for hyde_park hospitality including seats .
F	i ordered cottonwood curtains for my patio and bay_windows costing_£ 0 , 000 .
F	parcel did arrive promptly though .
M	every time i have used this company there has_been a problem .
F	despite living 0 minutes away from a good tyre_centre , and being_able to drive my car on the " run flat ", i decided to use e_- tyres and pay a little extra .
M	however we resolved most of these issues with his boss amicably .
M	what a disaster !
M	both of us use tyreshopper and national , and have done for 0 years .
M	other than that it was very satisfactory .
M	i will use again and recommend to anyone .
M	in terms of its lightness and manouverability it is good but the fact that it does not completely replace a standard upright means that a second machine is required to do corners , cobwebs and ceilings .
F	i will never book with them again !!
F	six_months later i called quidco and as it has_been so long they released the payment anyway after some coaxing !
F	the whole company deserves to catch syphilis and then go to hell and be locked in a flaming hot cell with adolt hitler , fred west and jimmy saville .
M	the products ( headphones and amplifier ) arrived following_day and to cap it all they sent me a lollipop !
M	0_star service !
F	she rang me this morning to say they were absolutely_beautiful .
F	i received tickets only two_days before the concert and that was on a friday .
F	when what you buy doesnt work you expect a company to arrange a replacement - not these people - they cannot even be bothered to reply to emails .
M	update , update , update !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
F	so disappointed for my friend .
M	shocking customer service .
F	trying to contact them to get an answer is a nightmare .
F	the excuse was import clearance which apprarently is out of tge or ups '_s control .
M	collections are a nightmare !
M	i usually buy from john_lewis all my flowers so lets_see the quality of flowers you deliver .
F	will be recommending this company for certain .
M	they also created an artificial , very short deadline that if you did not reject their offer , they would proceed with their new price .
M	the published pictures of apparent location do not meet reality , but smelly environment with run down cheap furniture .
M	however i was not ringing them for that reason so obviously telepathy is not a strong point at orange .
F	so lets get busy and start using it
M	orders received the next_day , impressive
M	there appeared to be no security at all and the fact that we were not required to leave our car keys meant that if there were a fire or any other incident none of the vehicles could be moved .
F	very hard to understand anyone as they seem to be located everywhere but england !
M	the quality of the worktops is superb and they now look great in our new kitchen .
F	i have done 0 orders now .
M	the car_hire company never quote all inclusive price for example , we had to pay £_00 for winter_tyres
F	four telephone_call later still had no helpful resolution or advice from customer service department .
F	would never recommend or use this company for their sheer lack of incompetence and poor customer service .
F	i obviously couldn_'_t ask my hubby to take me because it '_s his surprise pressie !
F	i '_m very happy with the service that i received and the product i purchased !
M	i immediately cancelled the order and got a reply_stating they would refund my order but it could take 00 days !
F	i am seriously_considering making an official_complaint against them .
F	now i want to buy a table and chairs to match .
M	even when things went wrong ( the video card '_s 0nd hdmi_port was faulty ), not only did cryo responded swiftly but i even got an engineer come round , replace the faulty component , verify the new one worked_fine and give the system a complete health check before leaving !
F	never mind , i '_m creative and have made mine off the shoulder , added a laced corset over the top and a frilly under skirt . it looks ok !
F	very annoyed .
M	great prices , great advice .
M	it was easy to get cover with uia and so_far i have no cause to complain
F	even better the shoes were perfect .
M	the wardrobe was faulty , damaged , unfinished and showed very poor workmanship with no quality control for the following reasons ;
M	they agreed to this .
M	i ordered a flower with a birthday_cake from iflorist . co . uk on 0th_jan_0000 and the website told me that they will deliver it on 0th as i required .
M	great customer service all the way through ( especially from alan in sales ).
M	excellent service and value for money .
F	loved my chaise so much i ordered a second one !
F	fitter rang to confirm arrival time on fitting day , which was accurate .
F	arrived following_day
F	product was good once it finally arrived but it took over a week , i wouldn_'_t mind if it was free_p_&_p you can '_t complain then , but when you have to pay for it and wait ages . also none of the packs had scoops in them - you have to buy these apparently !
M	after getting the glasses returned i sent them another letter saying that if they didn_'_t even read my first letter how was i to believe they even tested the glasses , they replied to say they had sent them tested by an externally and they were correct .
F	highly_recommend .
M	the support staff are laughably unhelpful and just tell you to contact your online_retailer .
M	the website offered me a discount and i successfully placed an order including paying on my credit_card .
F	i '_ve always admired bhs having shopped in their stores frequently , this was my first on - line order with them and it is also my last ever purchase at bhs .
F	i would say do not ever book with lakelovers . co . uk .
F	great service & great price .
F	no problem , until the phone_call from the restaurant saying they didn_'_t deliver to my postcode .
M	avoid at all costs .
F	i did my order on line so had copies of all my correspondence .
M	pointless ordering it online not happy !!!!!
M	good .
F	the second one arrived the next_day but no - one was in .
M	tackle_uk sent me an item that had been taken out of its packaging and there was a piece missing so i could not use the item they sent me .
M	the company took my money , failed to provide the item at the advertised price , and to date has failed to refund me .
M	deposit paid , job_done !
M	i usually receive my lenses the day after purchase and the whole_process is quick and easy .
M	i would happily_recommend them .
F	in the meantime i have had to order the plus size costume which is more money and is far to big but i have to sew in all places to fit my entertainer .
F	it was priced well , the packaging was good and the delivery time just what i needed .
M	i was able to go the website and find the part i required fairly easily . i ordered and paid on line and in a couple of days the required part arrived - no_hassle .
M	but that was more by luck than any proactive planning or engagement from the delivery company .
F	so i took it up with my credit_card and got money back !
M	the other three nights the service was sloppy .
M	this is not the first time this has happened with pharmaceutical companies who use a third_party payment system and deny all responsibility for it when it goes_wrong .
M	per_kg , per 000g , per pack etc
F	used a voucher_code from mighty_deals "£ 00 worth of flowers for £_00 "
F	on other_sites i use a message comes up saying words to the effect of " spend another £ x to get free delivery / extra bonus points / 00_%_discount " or whatever .
F	way back in early march i ordered a piece of furniture .
F	i was told that in the time from selecting the flight to confirming payment the product was no_longer available .
M	but i shall think_twice about buying from ecco another time .
M	i rang the local office and told them what i had done and even gave them the drivers_name " paul ", they said they had no record of this on the system even_though i quoted the drivers_name they didn_'_t believe me .
F	a month went by and suddenly money for a talktalk bill was taken from my bank_account , now i hadn_'_t used any of their services for over a month and having asked for it to be cancelled i got back on the phone to them , where they passed me from person to person hung_up on me and tried to refuse giving me my money back , until eventually telling_me the only was i could get a refund would be in a months time or unless i filed an indemnity claim with my bank - now i did not see why i should have to wait a month for them to pay back money they had essentially stolen from me so i went_ahead and file an indemnity claim at the bank , whilst on the phone talktalk assured me i would be charged no more money and all charges such as early cancellation charges would be voided as they could not provide me with the services i wanted and they had messed me around .
M	very slow when processing orders , i know you are a big company but make it faster so i can be a happier customers !!!!
M	excellent materials used in the construction .
F	never use this company .
F	i really wouldn_'_t bother , i know some people find it brilliant , but not me !
M	second time i '_ve_used glasses_direct , both_times i '_ve been very happy indeed .
F	they arrived saturday_morning , but my invoice stated it had been due for delivery on the thursday .
F	i cannot_fault the service from made .
F	i hate the fact i am contracted to o0 and am unable to leave without a huge fine .
F	after looking at ałl these reviews , i feel a complete idiot for even considering groupon , obviously it '_s just another money making scam .
M	would i use them again , oh_yeah .
M	so i checked with tyreshopper for the price of 0 x avon_zv0 '_s , as i had two avons fitted to the rear last_year via tyreshopper and had found them to be much_quieter and better riding than the original tyres_fitted to my mondeo .
F	can '_t fault them
M	every_month they continue to send me bills for a property i don_'_t live in .
M	i understnd the desire to maximise sales in the run up to christmas but perhaps
F	we did all the checks etc ourselves so can '_t comment on this side of their service but we would definitely use them again .
M	i ordered after close of play on monday apparently - so as i had builders in i decided to ring and ask on the thursday when they were being delivered .
F	i checked the internet and was able to find a number for yodel .
F	returning it to viovet has_been more costlier than i could have imagined .
M	my overall feeling was disappointment some of the items arrived well_packaged and others did not , there was a feeling of inconsistency to how items are packaged both within the jules_b branches and also sent out when you purchase directly from a jules_b branch and from the online service .
F	i appreciate that this isn_'_t walls and floors fault but it does impact on the customer '_s overall opinion of the company .
M	annoyingly can only enter a single discount_code even if have more .
F	thankyou .
F	they are conveniently claiming that they have no record of the call in which i was promised a refund if delivery was any later - such a lie .
F	!
F	there were several places in which glue had leaked from where two bits of wood had been stuck together .
M	the limousine service as part of the ticket was the icing_on the cake .
M	that was the first review - i had an mot from a different national a week_later to find it failed because one of the tyres had been fitted the wrong way round .
M	we placed our order one afternoon with a request for asap if possible and we were very impressed to receive the goods before 00am the following_day .
M	they need to work out their stock_levels and list it live on the website to avoid further inconvenience to customers .
M	recently taken out 0 contracts with three , a mobile_phone contract and broadband contract .
M	me cannot say enuff great things about this fantastic company .
F	sorry talk_talk but you ' re not listening to me - i am very disappointed with your service .
M	i ' d have previously recommended them , but dealing_with cs , i simply can '_t any more - if a company can '_t deal with complaints reasonably , then they are best avoided .
M	hopefully trust_pilot can find what " honest " means .
M	i simply redeemed the codes and right away , it worked .
F	this was my first experience of using this supplier and i was disappointed .
F	had i not had such a problem to find such a large pole , i would have returned it .
F	waste of money mrs haughton
M	mike
M	it appears that interlink who has a legal contract with my business , are more than happy to employ staff who blatantly break the terms of this contract and then lie through their back teeth to protect themselves .
F	customer_services at pram_world were very helpful and sent a new table out the next_day , unfortunately this new table was also faulty - third time lucky they sent out a replacement , which i am happy to say is fine .
F	they always have the batteries i am looking for , the website is easy to navigate , the postage very reasonable and the whole_experience is extremely quick and efficient .
M	international services definitely requires improvement .
F	i ordered 0 boxes of cigarellos .
M	the problems come when you have a problem with an order .
F	some of the information the sales_assistants gave_me was conflicting or incorrect , better knowledge of the prams i felt was needed .
M	what was more annoying still was that there were people at calais booking the journey with dfds so i cannot understand the problem .
F	i usually get a quick response from this company but my last two items were late , one was late by nearly 0_weeks , with no message to inform_me it was out of stock , and another was at_least 0_weeks late .
M	i did have one tiny problem with one of the fixings but having contacted their customer service department , , which was easy to do , they fixed the problem politely and with 0_star treatment
F	well , first of all i paid 00_quid for 0 - 0 day delivery and it took 0_days .
F	if you cantravel with just hand_luggage you do generally work out cheaper , but it '_s never as convenient and the airport is generally quite far away from its description
F	customer service not brilliant but have now received book and very pleased with end_result .
F	go - electrical were professional and did solve the problem as well as they could but it had to be delivered to my work during the day instead .
M	if only all internet transactions could be like this .
M	they are friendly , helpful and very reliable .
M	the prices were very good , and the demonstration_video '_s were really useful for someone_who had never done anything like this before .
M	i booked tickets and everything worked ok but i can '_t see why the site is any better_than rail_europe .
M	why cans all firms be like this and free next_day delivery at the cheapest price around .
F	the only_thing i would say is that when we turned the camera on the language wasnt set to english , so we had to download the manual ( the hard_copy wasnt english either ) to figure_out how to change it .
F	you need to be able to give a price and keep to it , just think £_00 was a lot and it has cost me alot more than i wanted to pay .
M	informed that order had not been put on delivery truck .
M	ordered on 00 / 00 / 00 , paid extra for special delivery and payment taken immediately .
F	floraqueen confirmed they would deliver on 00 september .
M	we had older children with us and for us and we felt somewhat detached from the rest of the group .
M	delivered in good time in each case
M	logged on on friday_afternoon .
F	what does that say .
F	they have now promised the money back but not seen anything yet so who_knows !
M	end has a wide rage of great clothing and i shop_here all them time .
M	i have always had brilliant service from netflix !
F	kept me updated by email regularly .
F	simple and efficient - and if you need to ring them - really friendly , patient staff at the end of the phone ( i don_'_t think they do problems - they only seem to have solutions )!
M	products are okay but then service needs to be more professional .
M	it is now our policy to call after_placing an order .
F	there was no personal response to two of my e_-_mails , and more_importantly , the parcel arrived a week after i placed the order , containing all the items - nothing was cancelled and my request had been ignored .
F	communication_regarding the order was good .
F	we are traveling all over canda and usa . everywhere we are stopping viator had trips running from there .
F	i was surprised and disappointed to hear that a 00 hour guaranteed delivery could not be arranged , even_though i was willing to pay extra to ensure the badges arrived on time .
F	i ordered a feminine tens_machine from chemist_direct for about % 00 of the ebay price for the identical brand with inexpensive delivery to australia .
M	no one was available and i was told i ' d be called back within 00_hours .
M	they were very helpful and said they would contact the chessington depot to locate the parcel .
M	couldn_'_t find them cheaper anywhere .
M	all ok good good good good
F	i once again tried to log in and have met nothing but problems .
F	i was likely to be a regular customer spending_hundreds if not thousands of pounds .
F	i ordered a seal for my washing_machine , on the website the picture_shown was exactly_what i needed and it stated it was a genuine part however upon fitting this seal to my machine it was missing an integeral part , i emailed part_master with no response so i called them to find out they wouldn_'_t refund me or send me the correct seal , as i had fitted it into my wachine , which any one would do thinking the right genuine part was sent , it was part masters mistake for sending me the wrong part , and they won_'_t refund or replace this redundant seal i spent over_£_00 on , i held up my end of the bargain by entering all the correct info and paying so it '_s only fair they send me what i paided for , if you want to be ripped_off and fobbed_off then part_master is the place to order !
F	the item is perfect and very well priced .
M	my 00 : 00 appointment was cancelled at 00 : 00 the day before as they couldn_'_t get the tyres in time .
F	i was very disappointed , flowers broken , flowers were brown edged and the box they arrived in were saturated with water .
M	web_site said in stock .
F	i was positively_surprised by urban_industry !
M	i have spoken to the merchants directly and they have confirmed they have paid topcashback , so they are sitting on the money and simply refusing to pay it to me and keeping it for themselves .
M	i think a major communications problem between the on line retailer and thier supplier
F	thankyou
F	recently bought fitflops for half the price i could get them elsewhere so not only great value but my order arrived superquick .
M	we have been trying to obtain a refund for an item we purchased , we have been fed a saga of lies , changing information and today when it was promised the goods woould be returned to us " repaired " they have failed to deliver them .
M	i did this last saturday as i wanted to send some flowers but couldn_'_t get out to go to the local_florist .

F	after getting so far through the booking process that i '_d entered my card_details and clicked ' confirm this booking ' a number of times at a certain price , the very last_hurdle was a page stating the price had gone up by 00_quid .
F	i found the ordering on line easy to use .
F	had paid the £ 0 . 00 for premium service .
M	part of the work was for three joints .

F	when i turned the box around i could hear all the bits inside , i was dreading what i would find inside , the packaging looked great , well secure so i was really disappointed that many of the cigarillos had bits that crumbled off them , there were about 00 that were broken , which isn_'_t too bad out of 000 , but lots of them had bits crumbled off 😟

F	i love that you can try up to 0 different frames at any one time at home for free ( although you really have to be on the ball sending them back quickly ), and i found this much_nicer_than going into an opticians and having to try things on with a salesperson breathing_down my neck , even if it took a bit longer to work out what i liked .
F	a lot of the retailers are far too slow to pay out , also others have not tracked .
M	i could have opted for a bank_transfer but i personally preferred to receive a cheque .

M	all in all , no issues with my items but wasn_'_t expecting it to take as long as it did to receive the cheque .
M	but , the main point is that they accept no responsibility whatsoever for your vehicle and that is a concern for me .
M	i phoned the next_morning and was told that it would deffinately be with me that day and if there were any_issues the driver would call me . all day went by and no parcel .

M	waste of time .
M	csl will not respond to letters , or e_- mails .
M	!
M	a couple more days passed , and nothing arrived .
M	bath_panel wasn_'_t with bath , and wasn_'_t clear it was an extra .
M	how exactly could the delivery have been made if the lock on my oil_tank had not been busted ?

M	are you expecting me to take the next few weeks off work hoping that it might finally arrive one day ?"
F	thank_you for all your help and patience .
F	what the hell is the point ?
M	i was tempted to phone him to say ' nothing personal , but you ' re going to have to accept that i am your friend , without my having to join some official club in order to prove it to you '.
M	can '_t rate the service enough .
M	wren give the impression that this is business as usual for them .
F	overall , poor service and not no customer focus .
F	as always my vitamins arrived within two_days .
M	i was passed around 0 separate operators and ended_up giving up and calling to get help when tracking incorrectly delivered order .
F	despite this an excellent service and will definitely use this service again .
M	i find paypal a useful financial service but as most of my transactions are small , the fees make it inappropriate for serious business volumes .
M	delivery was pretty prompt and product is nice albeit the very vibrant coloured balls that form the key feature of the coat_rack lack colour .
F	the delivery was very good .
M	used frost to buy por - 00 paint for the restoration of my vw .
M	cash_genie offered me cash when i needed it so i guess i cant_fault them there .
M	i did however receive an email on the 0rd of january to state that my order had been dispatched .
M	i got an email_saying they had received none of my emails - despite my previous email being copied at the bottom of the one they were replying too ( ahem bulls_** t ).
M	they gave_me a call a few_days after i had received the parts to check that i was happy and continued to help me and answer any questions that i had .
F	love the rain shedding pole in the centre .
F	i have done about 0 now and the colour is really poor compared to original photographs .
M	just say what it costs on the first page , please .
M	this follows the same pattern as the many previous times i have ordered from battery_force , just faultless service .
F	in fact the other colours available in this style are strangely named as red alert & emerald , neither of which bare any relation to to the photographed colours which are much softer than their names suggest .
F	when spending 000gbp i '_d like an eye for that sort of detail !
M	the loading process was a shambles , those of us traveling on motorcycles were treated_like second class citizens . we were directed into a tiny area with barely enough room to dismount from our motorcycles and not enough room to open our_luggage cases . we were made to park our bikes so close together there was no room to move between them . we were left to secure our own bikes with filthy ratchet_straps with no help or guidance from the deck crew . some riders were on their first ferry trip and were at a complete loss as how to secure their bikes , this could have led to a serious situation . i was disgusted with out treatment i had a meeting with the first officer on the bridge to explain the situation in detail on the motorcycle problem .
F	apart_from that i have always loved the oka range .
M	they allowed my mum to drive the car home untaxed and so uninsured what idiots .
F	it will be not name or implicate by name any third_party .
M	they use ups to deliver and although i ordered wednesday_evening they promised to arrive by friday , great sun out busy weekend .
F	from_start to finish quick and easy .
M	i cannot understand how items that ' have been added to my order ' can then be out of stock - assuming their stock system would only allow in - stock items to be selected .
M	stay clear away from this " company ", it is the biggest ripoff i have ever come_across and wasn_'_t able to do anything about it !
M	hence the entire_process appeared seamless - making money flow .
M	well_packaged but let_down by slow delivery by courier , it took a week - yes a full 0 days to receive my goods .
F	so sunday came , no flowers , how very embarassing , and disappointing for my mother , when they did arrive they were already bloomed & starting to die .
F	delivery itself was well within my expectations and i was delighted with the goods .
M	no_problems on any occasion just a swift delivery of my order - no_fuss - no_problems
F	i have just odered refills for orginal bean_bags .
M	however we paid for a flexible return from calais to dover which said we had to phone 0 hours before journey .
F	to little , to late
F	have since been contacted by a management member , the original member of staff dealing_with ( or not dealing_with ) my query quit , i was offered the full phone price and it was paid into my bank_account the next_day .
F	quality was ok and as expected .
F	also it wasn_'_t very clear what to click on to , to input my details .
F	ordered two bags of dog_food bannered " buy two bags and save £_00 . 00 " when i queried this because full price was charged i was told this referred to the retail price that i may otherwise pay in a shop .
M	without a doubt the worst company i have ever_encountered !
M	booklets were easy to make using the software provided .
F	glasses - quite another story - 0 pairs coming from hong_kong .
M	a refund will stop me from advising friends from using long tern car_park .
M	i will be contacting bags direct to arrange for a replacement .
M	product arrived very quickly , but should have been packed much_better , since both the cans i ordered were badly deformed .
M	they have got to be one of the worst companies to deal with when it comes to changing or ending a contract , even after 0 hours of trying to get them to cancel my contract and being told that i was making " the wrong decision " by leaving them and that leaving them for a rival carrier was " stupid ", they still didn_'_t even do what i asked them to do in the first place which was end my rolling_contract , which resulted_in me having to phone them again , and of course going through the exact_same stuff and tripe that their staff have to come out with .
F	i have been advised by trading standads that as they have breached their contract to deliver the said flowers on the said day i should write and request a full_refund .
F	let_me contact them .
F	i tried one of them on a dvd_player today with no success !
M	the delivery was standard so i was expecting it ro arrive in a few_days , but it actually arrived the day after thay has sent it .
M	thank_you .
F	i '_m delighted with my new ray_bans .
F	it '_s accessible and helpful to all types of people , weather a novice or a dedicated gym rat .
F	i will certainly be recommending you to my friends and family
M	i upgraded to the iphone 0 , the person in the o0 stores told me it would take 0mins for my number to change over from my old phone to the new one .
M	easier than high_street shopping
F	0 .
M	needless to say , i shall not be using your company again and will be ensuring family and friends are aware of my experience .
F	however didn_'_t indicated that this is a glitch - its ' simply the way it '_s set_up .
F	i would not_hesitate to use them again .
M	a few minor_issues i know but at £ 0 , 000 . 00 you would expect it to be spot on !
F	i was assured i would be contacted to discuss the delivery , which i paid £_00 for due to my order being in their higher value bracket .
F	i signed_up to quidco a few_months_ago , and i am generally pleased .
M	to my relief the parcel was delivery around_midday the next_day .
F	my ankle was painful to walk on now it '_s not !
F	however i spoke to the recipient and they said that the flowers were just left on the doorstep , and after 0_days the roses started to droop .
F	love my roman_blinds quality good but the cords could be stronger
F	i would recommend your services to anyone
M	it clearly says on the box who to deliver the flowers too and when paying for a bouquet of flowers for be delivered i expected them to go to her and not be dumped in the office for all the staff to read and find out who they were for .
F	00 years_ago i was giving talks and i felt i wanted a record of our adventures .
M	!
M	bought my 00 " hitachi from argos 0mnths ago its now faulty have to take it back and they '_ll send it for repair how long for there not sure up to 00days do i get a tv to use in the meantime ha you must be joking my kids will drive me crazy do the care not a jot cause they have my money and i don_'_t have a leg to stand on .
F	do they really think they get away with this crap ?
M	the only time you got in contact was when i raised a paypal claim !
F	unfortunately when i opened the pack half the bars that were supposed to be in the pack had been replaced with more of the 0 varieties that were sent .
F	never ever .
F	fast delivery . excellent customer_services . brilliant . all_round .
F	i will never use them again and the case is on going with photographs to prove .
F	sitting on the metal bar and springs and huge gap at back of cushion when sat on it .
M	phoned me 0 days_later to tell me it was out of stock and it would be at_least another 0 days before i received it .
M	the website information on delivery timeline was incorrect .
F	i would certainly recommend them to anyone .
F	my emails were ignored and i could not get through on the helpline - every time i rang i was placed even further back in the queue !
M	the following_day i chased the order by phone as it hadn_'_t turned_up by 0 :_00pm only to be put through to customer_services and to be told that they hadn_'_t got stock .
F	my boiler stopped_working on the 00th_november , no heating or hot_water . i rang them and they said the earliest they can send an engineer out is three_days_later on 00st .
F	i got my order the next_day , which was great .
F	loved the choice & quality of items .
M	iordered my pl 00 headphones on friday and they were delivered to me in northern_ireland on saturday_morning .
F	i tried to explain that i can find my statement if required but it wasn_'_t enough .
M	unfortunately , it does not appear that the distributors have any idea of maintaining the good service delivered by the customer face of the company .
M	i ordered ny new accurist mb000b at_0000hrs on friday and it was delivered the following_morning ( in north_yorkshire ) at 0000_hrs - fantastic .
M	too early to say . sorry .
M	i will not be using this company ever again !
F	when we booked it there was a slight_hiccup on the booking site - not at dealchecker - and i had to speak to an agent .
F	they do offer some form of customer service ( which i haven_'_t tried ), but they take no responsibility for actually getting the food out to you .
M	they had been given my name and address round the wrong way , they asked for mr findon of peacock road instead of mr peacock of findon road .
M	i am_disgusted with the lack of any attempt to sort_out this problem , as they are still showing as in stock for 0 - 0 day delivery .
M	i know i didn_'_t .
M	bit disappointed i had to make two jouneys .
F	the ones i ordered last time were lovely .
F	told me the expected delivery date to snowinn '_s warehouse is 00 / dec /_0000 .
M	i don_'_t deliver , which i put in block capitals .
M	recommend by a friend .
F	this is the worst service i have ever received .
F	little disappointed that , although the parcel arrived quickly , our order was for white bags and we received red ( kept them as we were desperate !
F	on the 00th , the tracking_system was once again updated stating that they were unable to deliver the parcel ( but having contacted the recipient i knew for a fact that they hadn_'_t yet called her or attempted a delivery !)
M	the driver did call and arrived about 0 . 00 pm , better late than never .
M	i asked for order to be corrected , but another batch of distorted cards arrived .
F	i would certainly think_twice before placing a further order .
F	i would highly_recommend and will certainly buy again !
F	!
F	we pointed_out the state of the crockery and were told that he hadn_'_t noticed the chipped edges when he brought to the table even_though they were unmissable due to their size , he said he only brought ot and the chef was resposible for filling the ramekin so he obviously had not noticed either .
F	by late at night 00 january , i still had not received any contact as to when i might expect my order to be delivered .
F	now as anyone will know who shops online , the usual procedure is that you let the company know the shoes didn_'_t fit , and they come and collect them whilst delivering another pair .
F	i ordered a marie_curie product and liked the idea that a percentage of the price would go to that charity .
M	right ?".
F	so easy to order .
F	great service and great selection and prices !
M	i told them what i wanted to do , they advised , priced , delivered .
M	wow !
M	got an overall well balanced sound to it and good quality .
F	this is the first time i have dealt_with castlegatelights and although we have not fitted the lights yet as are not quite at that stage therefore i am unable to comment on the quality of the lights as of yet , the service was excellent .
F	i am really impressed with assos goods and the customer service .
M	i needed vari - focal lens .
M	somehow i don_'_t think this reflects the original vision and passion with which martha lane fox established the company and i '_m_sure she would be mortified if she knew how they treat their customers today .
F	!
F	what is the point of asking if you want to change the address if you are going to ignore the instructions ?
M	later , when payment did not turn_up , recipient realised she ' d given me incorrect information for payment to m - pesa account .
F	i did exactly as i should have done including writing a covering_letter explaining why i was returning the item with my order number and i expected my refund within 0_days as per their own t & c .
M	we came to visit your shop on the 00 / 00 /_0000 and ordered a table and two chairs with you .
F	fast delivery .
M	won_'_t order again , it is massively overpriced for the quality , i will get them from the bottom of my road as usual .
M	then told me it would take 00 days for a refund . i was lucky i paid with vise dabit so my bank eventually got it back for me
F	however my daughter has had to throw half of them out within a few_days .
F	product not used yet
M	would definitely be using them again over screwfix or b_& q my normal suppliers !
M	i was just beginning to trust this company and had placed my third order . received email to say order would be delivered next_day , nothing arrived , no explanation , all day wasted .
F	i was wary of using an internet opticions but had purchased a groupon_voucher so thought i '_d give it a try , im so glad i did , i tried out some frames at home , on home_trial and chose which style i liked .
F	the shoes were sent back in their original packaging unworn .
M	there are a few roads in this postal area with the same name as mine .
M	i then tried_calling back the number that appeared on my mobile but it rang then cut me off .
F	this time i am demanding my money back and compensation .
M	batteries were brilliant , minimum packaging , quick response , thank_you .
F	our small business relies on fast shipping / deliveries and good quality products , which is exactly_what we get from 0000rpm .
F	when i '_ve had my servicing and mots done there , they have always been straightforward to deal with , clear about any_problems and i feel_confident in their advice .
M	when the item i ordered arrived ( a set of six placemats ), i noticed one placemat was missing .
M	i have just tried it again to see it is better , and it seems to be .
M	we have had yodel deliver to us on many occassions without a problem so why was this so difficult ???
F	this is a good site for selling second_hand good and also purchasing .
M	i waited 0_weeks until after my order and decided to request a refund which , in all fairness was prompt and hassle_free .
F	i still don_'_t have the re - assurance from you that my package will leave the shop today .
M	i don_'_t think there is any intent to not pay but the whole_process was very slow and perhaps the xmas_period didn_'_t help .
F	overall ebookers was the easiest site to book flights with .
M	good priced product but was given a delivery schedule , waited all day but did ' nt show , text me next_day but i had to delay to day after , i think it was delivery firms fault
M	still no sign of a refund 0 months later .
M	the biggest irritation on the journey was that we were not able to check in on line for any but emirates and qantas .
M	excellent value , and a fast service , being kept_informed at every_step .
M	their customer_services team are rude and unhelpful and i genuinely think that the delivery staff must play_football and other sports activities with the parcels .
F	the jeans fit my son just fine
F	trust product 000_% - have certainly seen an improvement in my 00 year_old horse and tell others when then they remark on his youthfulness .
M	im well impressed with this camera , i think its that good that my father wants one now .
M	shiply make it easy to pay for they deposit ( their fee ) but after that you are on your own .
F	the service from kiddies_kingdom was good when it comes to sending the product but the delivery wasn_'_t .
M	used for both imports and uk deliveries , simple , no_fuss and reliable .
F	they ' re the same old dodgy corporation with a smiley_face on the box ( a bit like apple .)
M	so , let '_s hope the holidays goes great and there have been no misrepresentations / issues etc .
F	did i pay an extra gbp 00 for the volume , or for the weight , as the items could of been put in a padded_envelope and sent through the post .
F	the boots when they arrived were in excellent condition
M	thank_you hf
M	item was delivered within a few_days
M	please don_'_t ever dream of using that bloody yodel !
F	the service i have received is appalling .
F	groupon need to make_sure they have the vendors refund policy clearly_stated on groupons website , and have a more efficient help system .
M	items arrived promptly and as_described
F	with bonus box of chocholates makes it even better , this is what i call a service and customers choice .
F	the dual front_wheel is easily altered from the kerb and doorstep climbing position to country walking where both wheels travel on the ground reducing wheel wander .
M	i purchased a plant from you to be sent to south_africa instead of flowers for a funeral last_week and i have just received a notice that nothing has arrived .
M	great survice
M	i sent of the phone free_postage and insurance too if under £_00
M	i have been with t mobile for just 0_weeks but everyone from the shop staff to the help desks have been great .
M	they replied that that had not been given my phone number by tyreleader .
F	update
M	service was so good iv place 0 orders in the last 0_weeks , and they saved me weeks of tracking down vintage parts .
M	i will not use this branch again .
M	been on hold for 00_mins at 00p / min trying to get through to customer_services .
M	customer service fantastic , delivery fantastic , and no_quibbles at all !
M	ordered two products , although on the delivery note , weren_'_t delivered on the same day , although not a major thing , i did think something was missing from the delivery , maybe not their fault but the couriers .
F	however , he said that there was nothing he could do to help as these tickets are non - refundable .
M	so i took a chance and was extremely pleased with the quality of the trophies , the delivery times and the way they keep you up to date with the progress of your order ( text ) so i knew_exactly when it would arrive .
M	when the posters hadnt arrived after a few_days , i rang up the company , as i needed them for a display .
M	with the delivery time , but i am not satisfied with the length of time they lasted , by sunday
M	overall they are good but could do better !
F	got a phone_call at 0 to say my order will be delivered the next_day ( today ) this morning , sure enough i get a text saying it will delivered between 00 and 00 this morning .
F	luckily it was a reasonable_price and the job got completed after a delay in the collection .
F	i was wary of ordering without knowing the actual measurements of this item - but the blanket is a good large size and lovely quality .
M	looked on the internet today and the website was down , probably just a blip .
M	when i click the unsubscribe link , the server cannot be found .
F	meat tastes amazing !!!
M	i work in it and if the systems i developed were this poor , i ' d be sacked .
F	so i called redhill again to give them 0 more chance , but was still told that it should be delivered next week , but no guarantees .
M	wrong goods still_waiting for replacement ?
M	however they came through and managed to secure the product which was then delivered quickly .
F	i have been told on my email to pick_up the tickets on our arrival to the port but where do i pick them up ?
F	when i phoned to find out about it i got told different reasons .
M	website not bad .
M	john hughes
F	i will be surprised if she has driven more than 000_miles since the day we got the car .
F	everything about this experience points to bad practice and working under - hand and certainly false deals / advertisements .
M	first and last time i will ever buy with the car shop .
F	the flight price went from circa £_000 to over a £ 0000 .
F	you get charged something crazy like £ 0 a mb .
M	it not run out till may .
M	i '_ve just registered for a loyalty_card membership .
M	there was no way i was going through that again , so i took it down to my local vodafone dealer .
F	quick turn_around .
F	all in all i was pretty disappointed which is a shame :)
M	will_definitely be using this service again , thank_you !
F	0 . also ( l understand extra security ) but it turned_out out to be added stress upon the guarantor and the client needing the loan .
M	we also wanted broadband which , for the many , is indispensable .
F	my last order was extremely heavy and i am disabled and need them to bring it inside for me .
F	iwhen you need new tyers deffo do it this way , loads cheaper and quick ordered on wed_afternoon and hey_ho had them fitted on fri morn .
M	they then told me when i chased up that they had not stock ( despite the website showing the item as available ).
F	!.
F	also acknowledged .
M	the glasses arrived within a few_days and are excellent value for money .
M	needless to say with such incompetence as the norm i will not use them again .
F	i have since ordered glasses from another on line company , its a shame because i found the service quick efficient , costumer after care ss let them down , i would think_twice about recomending them to a friend 😞
M	!
M	i would definitey recommnend them - and use them again .
F	habe 0 zur auswahl bestellt .
F	ineeded to know something about the booking i made with lowcost yesterday , so phoned the 0000 no re existing booking to be promptly informed that no agents were available and it would cost me 00p_per_minute to wait !
F	the great thing too was postage was free !
F	i always recommend ecco_shoes to my friends and family .
M	i never like puzzles that don_'_t hold apart at the edges .
F	i received notification that the flowers had been delivered to my sister who had just been in hospital , i received an_email to say that the flowers had been left in a secure_place in the front of the house , this was totally incorrect as my brother - in - law had taken delivery of the flowers , which , had been delivered by a large furniture type van .
F	it is very straightforward to order just follow the step by step instructions , and i have found i have saved a considerable_amount of money for identical lenses which i would have formerly ordered from my optician .
F	i decided on the ray_ban aviators in the rose lens color .
F	each time i got to the checkout the site froze and i was returned to the home page !
F	i would certainly recommend penketh '_s for product quality , price and above all personal service .
M	the first of my rump_steaks had a lump of gristle at one end that i would question demonstrates a top quality cut .
M	thank_you pharmacy0u
M	not only is the service from mazuma very quick and reliable , it also offers the best price for your old_mobile_phone .
F	not wrong as process to sell very easy and straight_forward .
F	i tend to forget to ask to be parked by the lift . due to a disability .
F	i was informed 00 . 00 but the bar was told 00 . 00 .
F	i will never use this company again , i will be telling_everyone i know not to use them and if i hadnt been working all the time would have sold it on the high_street and got the money the same day !
F	my straightners were delivered in under 00_hours - thank_you !
M	do you want an insurance company that rips you off and fails to deliver on any of its promises and then blames other associated companies when things go_wrong ?!
F	the lady on the phone actually didn_'_t even offer this as an option - she offered me a refund which didn_'_t really help me get flowers delivered to a funeral !
F	not one second of film .
M	vanillamart makes buying vanilla_pods simple and easy , delivery is prompt and efficient leaving me time to enjoy myself .
F	o0 own this company and think its a great business plan to provide a service hiding_behind a new name " giffgaff " where they get the actual customer to provide all the support .
F	the service however was terrible , it took 0days to receive my order in which time i had managed to receive , send back and reorder and receive another pair of shoes from a different website !
F	we bought some submersible led_lights , for our table_decorations for our_wedding , they look amazing , great deal and speedy delivery .
F	it '_s like a bad comedy show .
F	it '_s so easy to reorder as they just send you a " click here to reorder " link .
F	also beware of the diversionary tactics they used with us to take our attention away from the forms .
M	would recommend even to a friend .
M	ha .
M	on arrival at the desk at pisa_airport with a document saying fully paid i was asked to take out further insurance that i assumed had already been paid this put the hire charge over £_000 i still feel slightly ripped of as i could not understand the language youre comments might clear this up ??
F	i buy stuff from these_folks a bit , and they do well . but when i emailed regarding pricing on the new festool pdc drill i wanted , the trail went cold after one inconclusive reply .
F	not good enough
F	total_waste of time and money !
F	these_folks are on the ball - orders are filled quickly and shipping is super_fast .
M	not parcel0go '_s fault would be a nice addition in my opinion to their website .
F	i appreciate that this is the postal service that enforce this restriction but it is extremely frustrating when i '_m waiting for a product that i need to assist me with my sports training .
F	when i bought the costume i waited 0_weeks and it was never delivered .
M	their platinum saver system is incredible !
M	if they would just be honest and put made to order on their site it would have saved me a lot of annoyance .
F	jo also sounded_like he really couldn_'_t care less and that my complaint wasn_'_t valid or important !
F	efficient service upon collection .
M	ordered set of drawers expected delivery as agreed to be to my house , that being my front_door in my home .
F	easy to find what i was looking for and quick delivery , thanks .
M	again thanx
F	!.
F	i was extremely disappointed and contacted serenatra straight_away and am still_waiting on a reply .
M	cms online '_s exploded views of my bike makes choosing the correct_part easy .
M	if you send flowers you need to know they are going to get there .
M	but would not detract_from ordering from trueshopping again .
F	this is crazy .
M	its not to be .
M	a few_days_later i phoned the company , and i was told that i would receive an update on the status of my order , but no such update was issued .
M	the offer very shortly .
F	great service and would definitely use again
F	outside lights were hanging off with wires exposed .
F	i spent the first hour of the weekend_break trying to get through to expedia but spent most of it on hold .
F	i ordered the tempest nars - lip_gloss on hq_hair because of the cheaper delivery than on the nars website .
M	i am just hoping as well that we didnt get a parking ticket when the car was picked_up as we saw the traffic warden was telling him to move away but he was chatting to someone then had trouble driving the car off .
M	fik hvad_jeg forventede
F	my mother - in - law was so pleased with the flowers and chocolates received .
F	i select express shipping !
M	the initial_contact with the support_team was very good .
F	great service and a quality product
F	this in turn prompted my urbanista to come out full force , because there '_s nothing that pisses me off more than someone not taking accountability and then saying it '_s my fault .
F	if i had not had this additional credit_card i would not have been able to hire the car .
M	simple ?
F	so if you want good customer service from this company forget it , there quality of cards are very good but when something_goes_wrong their customer service is truly appalling .
M	literally , the very next month they increased it to £_00 !
M	the0 tyres ordered are a whopping_£_00 (£_00 each ) cheaper_than i can get them here on the isle of man and that '_s inc shipping just amazing value !
F	on wednesday 00th , i overheard lee contact his manager as he was concerned straightaway about the position of the main light switch , something which was raised with the surveyor as i was worried that john fox had not taken this into_consideration in his design .
F	they go out of their way to make themselves difficult to contact eg by fax - who uses fax these days ?
M	i received an email the following_day stating " the driver delivered it so that '_s the end of this enquiry " so i rang them to speak to a ' real ' person , the automated_message stated that the answer time is 00_secs after 0 mins or so i thought they may be lying , i got through to an operative and my only question was " if the driver has delivered it to a neighbour , then which one " that '_s it , that '_s all i needed to know , my reply will be forwarded to me possibly within 00_hrs ,
F	first of all , i hate the new website .
M	the goods took over a week to arrive well within the up to 00 days the web_site suggested it could take due to the items coming from a depot in europe .
F	!
M	delivery promised within 0 to 0 ' working_days '.
M	wonder_if the person parking it was really tall and had a bit of a sleep in it ??
F	very clear , easy site to use .
M	the fridge_/_freezer is back in business in only a few_days .
F	the wrong bettery was collected efficiently .
M	delivered the day after i ordered .
F	they were so thin you could almost see the contents through them .
M	and since it takes around 00 days to get a gp appointment it kind of all defeats the object really !
F	zwazea000000000
F	i couldn_'_t get_hold of anyone on the number provided and i used the online form asking for someone to contact me , no - body ever got in touch .
F	maybe their management should visit the us and find out what customer service really is .
M	thank_you for your help .
M	the ship was kept very clean and tidy ( the crew were even washing the outside windows in all the wind and rain )!
M	their packing service it sub - standard & customer service shambolic !
F	why can '_t i leave 0_stars !
F	we are happy now the bathroom is fitted but expect there to be leaks with the poor quality taps and time will tell if the panel ends up having to be replaced .
F	avoid the hassle and don_'_t use !
M	several of my e_- mails were simply ignored but eventually i got a reply telling_me they were awaiting stock and would contact me - the problem is that they don_'_t and it '_s left to you to chase them ( again ).
M	well_done mazuma !
F	from the selection available to the prices .
F	free delivery was excellent and then for the glasses to arrive the day after meant i would have no_hesitation in using again or recommending to anyone .
M	i would absolutely recommend this service .
F	never had any_problems .
M	and am waiting to hear from them .
M	the products received are fakes .
F	they offered me 0oml bottles for a couple of pounds less_than the 000ml_bottles i '_d paid for !
F	you just have to get lucky with the drop_off / pick_up times they run every 00_mins i '_d say more like 00mins , but wsnt too much of a n issue . would use again
M	i put in the information and received about five responses within 00_hours .
F	!
F	thoroughly_recommend this company .
F	this is our second time ordering blinds . we are very pleased with them and would recommend to our friends .
M	i had to chase them twice by email and twice by telephone - no one answered it was just an answering mahine .
F	my most_recent prescription was in fact out of date , a fact i had not noticed .
M	i informed her that i am not happy with this and she agreed that it will be fine to pay for 0 people on one card and 0 on the other .
F	product is very sturdy .
M	bought it and paid straight_away and received a mail to say it had been posted .
M	shame as this company is normally really good .
M	does_exactly_what it says on the tin booom !!
M	my contact was steve_crawshaw he explained all the details of equity_release pitfalls and all , he answered all my questions , and when i was ready to go_ahead he progressed the paper_work for a speedy completion .
F	this has happened to me before but i was willing to put it down to some sort of interupted internet_connection .
F	a lot of the promotions are geared up for those who can play in the evening and there is very little incentive for the morning / daytime players to play .
F	the driver knocked on the door and asked if i would help with the box as it weighed 00kgs and he couldn_'_t lift it .
F	lovely and fresh and good condition .
M	all items arrived quickly and as_described .
M	after mothers_day ) i received a request for a destination phone number , which i had already included on my original order .
M	their website just isn_'_t very well_done , its often tedious to find things , and it takes a long time to add things to cart .
M	revised rating following the apology from the company , and some compensation .
F	easy to order and quick to deliver .
M	the engineer that they arranged to attend agreed that the tv lift mechanism was indeed faulty .
M	what they forgot to say was it doesn_'_t matter_how many_times you ring the number ( in my case 00 times to date ) they will not answer .
M	busuu is great for meeting and getting to speak with natives of the language you are trying to learn .
F	ordered two items , with business post 0 - 0 day delivery , after a week i contacted parmacy 0u as no sign of delivery , and was informed that one of the two items were out of stock .
M	would process the refund as a matter of urgency - to finally resolve the issue .
M	unfortunately i just could not afford to send it back and wait for another week for a replacement as it was urgently_needed so i straightened it up and installed it .
F	i ordered and paid for goods on 0 dec . a week_later , as the goods had not arrived , i emailed them and they said they were having trouble getting supplies .
F	customer service has_been good since we sent in a complaint , shame that the transfer company in mallorca is unreliable and the actual service wasn_'_t provided .
M	simon
F	i ordered a prescription_drug which did arrive reasonably promptly .
F	i sent them a message the day after i received this email , using the online contact form on their website , in which stated that a courier had been to collect my item on 0rd_december and that i had a receipt from him proving this , and asking what i should do .
F	but the actual table was badly made and therefore difficult to put_together and is pretty wonky !
M	the staff were friendly and competent and knowledgeable .
M	i sent email which wasn_'_t responded to .
M	be warned - if something isn_'_t right the company won_'_t entertain you and you will lose your money !
F	they have grudgingly conceded that we did indeed cancel the order but here '_s the amazing thing . instead of doing what any decent company would do and immediately refunding our money because it was their mistake we have to wait for them to get the computers back from their shippers before they will refund us .
M	i have contacted several_times with dhl_express here in madrid and we have specify a delivery schedule and they don_'_t deliver me the item .
F	we found it to be unacceptable and wrote an_email asking about delivery date and compensation for such a long delay ( it has_been a month ).
M	very fast despatch of goods , and very easy installation for the lam flooring and works beautifully
M	i wasn_'_t sure what memory to buy but the site walked me through everything step by step , simple and easy .
M	would it not be so much_better if they learned from their mistakes and just package and send items ordered , there are so many online traders that can achieve good relations with their customers but value basket are not one of them .
M	i dont really care which celebrity is sleeping with another celebrity or which celebrity has a new haircut or who looks great in their new dress .
F	unfortunately , i '_m going to have to find another_supplier which is a shame because they used to be so good .
F	defo will never book with them again .
M	when we challenged that ( the correct answer is : if you are between 00 and 00 years old , and all drivers have to have at_least 0 year of driving_licence ), he became rude and dismissing .
F	friendly helpful staff who are able to help with anything and respond efficiently to any_queries .
F	it '_s been now 0 whole days that we '_ve been stupidly waiting for our delivery !!
F	booking_fee and cancellation charge are not clearly_marked with the price when booking .
F	had to purchase again .
F	to compound matters he could offer no reason_why it hadn_'_t been delivered in store , and told me i had 0 options ; cancel and wait up to a week for my money back , or drive nearly 00 miles to the market harbourough store as they did have one in stock !!!
F	luckily my son will ' share ' his chair for a while and we can keep the one we have bought but i may have chosen a different colour knowing this .
F	well we argued and argued until dreams finally got the bed to us two_weeks late and gave_us a cheque for £_000 .
M	received them together in a very quick time !
M	they have terrible customer service and if you do a quick google_search you will find out that the goods are shipped into the uk as " gifts " and no import_tax is paid .
F	so that was all good .
M	newsflash : do believe all you see and read about bt .
F	still_waiting for delivery so can not comment positively did not expect to have to wait this long . used other photo sites in the past and had a lot quicker delivery .!!!!!
F	this is where the trouble started .
M	late_afternoon and we now have a fitting date of tomorrow and wednesday but it took a lot of explaining the hassle that we had clearing a room into the rest of the house and taking 0 days leave to be here when they decided to come originally and failed .
M	before i say all the below i just want to say i love the ja store and there clothes but they need to sort some stuff out that '_s why i '_m writing this .
F	so trust and use now when in a hurry
M	they never used to be like this , buyers_beware !
M	the cheapest price on the net for the dyson dc00i animal , painless ordering followed_by swift delivery , definitely a returning customer
M	i couldnt call on thursday but called 0st thing on friday_morning stating i wanted to cancel part of the order as no one would be there to receive the delivery .
M	i then had them transfer some monies to it .
M	good quality worktop .
F	the worst thing i done was change from my old school flex 00 to a shitty i phone contract i have a few_weeks to go and my 00 year relationship with tmobile is over !!!!
M	the prices are a little high , but considering there is major under - provision of japanese food products in supermarkets in the uk , it '_s not a big deal .
F	unfortunately the tap was damaged .
M	the contact_numbers are hidden for the local depots so you cannot call them to chase them up .
F	the info was nothing essential .
M	would deffinately recommend
F	i was a little disgruntled that i had to pay a £_00 delivery charge for the new white grout but am not unreasonable and can understand .
F	great place to easily compare_prices and reviews , payments very easy
M	will use your service again
F	this cannot be right .
F	i would say that there was £_00 - ish worth of meat in the hamper rather_than £_000 so you get what you pay for rather_than the hamper being half price ( we are beef farmers and i am used to good quality beef and know what you have to pay for it !).
F	i chose the colour i wanted then picked a style and length .
F	no recommendation will be offered to anyone ; as i paid for absolutly nothing .
F	tree was in my garage by 0 . 00am tuesday !
M	tbh it was a total_con job , low price on booking but actually works out dearer in the long run .
F	we wanted a peugot type but were ' upgraded ' to a ford_focus .
F	i am already gearing up to by them for a birthday .
M	very quick service , arrive the next_day .
M	the package arrived in good time , so am happy with the efficient service .
M	therefore , unless you are sure about item size & quality and fit - do not buy there .
M	all good .
F	it carried tents , equipment , food and more for four days from loch hourn to barrisdale and many hills in between .
F	most people would agree that a parcel has shipped only when it '_s been collected by or dropped_off with the courier .
F	i have used the service twice , after_searching for many hours trying to find my husband his_favourite rum that reminded him of his time in india , i finally found it .
M	firstly - it is disgraceful that you can only write comments if you are satisfied .
M	the full details of our experience is outlined in my letter to dfds of 00th_july .
F	this set is a gift for my mum and i am sure she will not be disappointed !
F	also talktalk put a cap on charges and once you go over the limit they simply cut you off . every time !
F	he then_proceeded to tell me that if ann_summers hadn_'_t been notified of a problem , they couldnt fix it .
M	i paid for lots of extras including a new chain set ( shimano m000 deore ), which included the peddle shafts .
M	also really useful for checking things like historical price changes and statistics for the prices of different bookmakers .
F	you can print_off your_own freepost_label to send your item right away you just have to package it safely and take it to the post_office , they received my item within two_days and i had the money in my bank within the week .
M	so i ordered flowers for my girlfriends_birthday .
M	the delivery is fast :)
M	optimax were and are the best in my opinion .
M	therefore they ripped us off for £ 0 or so extra for the credit_card surcharge which is a fixed amount by allowing a flight to be booked seperately .
M	every one fitted_perfectly , extremely well made and excellent quality .
M	he was made up and is planning to visit his territory .
F	if the full_amount is refunded as promised , i will_continue using your services in the future and increase the rating of my review as it clearly shows you care about your customers .
F	i ordered my litter trays for my elderly pet rats who have difficulty climbing so the height was off great importance .
F	michelle at holiday please was fantastic .
M	once again service and efficiency as expected .
M	this is the second time this year i have used flyerzone , and been happy both_times .
F	postage seemed expensive too .
F	thank_you .
M	it drove well and the customer_care on arrival and return was super .
F	i also would say that as i drink a lot of decaff , nespresso it is hard to please a decaff drinker every time .
M	it '_s a dhame because we always used to look_forward to our breakfasts on the ferry .
F	i was delighted and will definitely use we buy books again , it '_s so easy and the money is great !
M	!
M	if you had of emailed me i would have known that my payment had not gone_through i was still_waiting for you to deliver the item but i was giving you a bit more time before starting a dispute case with ebay
F	overall , the sales service was excellent but the delivery was a bit shabby .
F	all members of staff i dealt_with were friendly , polite and knowledgeable .
M	due to the low value of the order i couldn_'_t be_bothered to waste time chasing this up .
M	the watch is superb , exactly_what i wanted .
M	i strongly_recommend you look else where i regret placing the order .
M	true you do have to be patient with some retailers , but i take the view that if they eventually pay i '_m happy to wait - after all it '_s free cash !
M	i am now left without anywhere to work and no one seems to care .
M	very helpful over the phone , tried_contacting me several_times by phone and email after i had input the wrong info on to the web forms .
M	can '_t fault their service - i am very pleased to have found them and would certainly use them again and heartily_recommend them .
F	however , the business has had my money since monday and four full working_days to post my order .
M	i have recommend this great company to all bikers mates and as a recovery mechanic .
M	on our outward_trip we found that the choice of a decent breakfast was disappointing otherwise the trip was ok . on our return trip the ferry was late by at_least 00 min although we were told 00_minutes at book in , we were guided to a position on the lorry deck that was walled at both_sides , when we returned we found it almost_impossible to regain access to our vehicle as a very large lorry was places behind us thereby massively reducing the space down each side to get to our car , my wife had to climb a safety barrier to get through , this was completely_unacceptable as my wife has walking difficulties and struggled to gain our rightful access to our car , i am disappointed at the overall service compared to both p_& o and the now_defunct sea_france , i will probably not use your service in future as it by no means compares to p_& o . i consider our experience as being against health and safety guidance and would advise that you seriously review you loading procedures regarding giving safe and adequate access to vehicles parked on all decks
F	i would recommend chemist_direct to everyone .
M	and don_'_t you dare respond to this saying ' send us an email ' - i know for a fact you won_'_t reply .
M	my advice , pay a bit more and buy from a well established , reputable_company .
F	as a single_female traveller it was another heart in mouth moment !
M	hotel location to covent_garden and theatre land was also quite good ' nevermind being reasonably close to oxford_street , using the bus , so that my wife could enjoy some shopping .
F	i hope the staff at bcs will now use this method for packing other liquids such as syrup to prevent this happening again .
M	well_done halfords , keep_up the great work .
F	the only redelivery option in the week would have involved being at home between 0 and 0 , impossible due to work_commitments , so i was forced to pay £ 0 . 00 for delivery on saturday_morning .
M	i ' d expected them to slash the rates once the iphone_0s had come out .
F	a couple of days ago .
F	on a positive_note , the parcel was well_packed and dpd were super and delivered according to the hour time_slot that was e_- mailed to me ; for £ 0 . 00 this is great value .
F	don_'_t be tempted_by their cheap deals they don_'_t exist and are lies !
M	however i have had an issue with false_advertising and not recieving all the products i ordered as part of a set which i couldnt return because it was opened and after a few e_mails back and forth trying to get what i ordered they just started ignoring them .
F	i will not be using this company again .
M	i would certainly recommend them and will no doubt continue to use them again .
M	placed two_separate_orders , one by phone and one on the internet .
M	good prices though .
F	these people are thieves , and should not be allowed to continue trading .
F	lee also advised me that the internal brackets had not been delivered but should arrive the following_day – at no time were we advised of this in_advance by hammonds .
M	the website is easy to use to upload your logo and see how your finish items will appear .
F	courier texted time of delivery and emailed and then delivered !
M	very easy to use but the bunch i picked at £_00 ended_up being £_00 .
F	for next christmas i was going to use jessops cewe to make a full photobook of family history and make 0 copies for myself and my siblings .
F	the service was very quick and it only took 0_days ( 0 were saturday and sunday ) from sending the phones to having the money in my account .
M	when i needed caravan tyres i decided to see if they could help i received first_class advice and next_day service from event .
F	it takes to long for the dvd to arrive , and you have to pay postage .
M	agent unable to discuss issue just arranged an exchange , and if still incorrect , a refund .
M	never had a problem good fast service
M	i have updated the review to three stars .
M	i was certainly unable to get through on the phone lines for 0 hours this morning before this initial review was posted and a chase up email sent 00_hours ago to the above email address .
F	internet sale all easy & clear .
M	i have had the specs for a week now and i am absolutely_delighted with them , they came just a week after ordering them , that '_s is quicker_than if i had got them on the high_street .
F	would definitely use this company again as the service is one of the best i have received from an internet_shopping store .
M	quality tyres , good grip , very good price , and i can really tell the difference since the 0 new tyres i have had fitted .
M	after altering the electrics and radiators in 0 rooms to suit the furniture we liked we where told delivery would take 00 days totally_unacceptable !
F	they asked me if i would like to cancel and refund the other products and just send the food .
F	but nobody answers just a message_saying all they are experiencing unusual high call volumns ( hardly surprisiing since this company seems to want to take money but provide nothing else )!!!
F	wouldnt_hesitate to recommend
F	however , the night before the event , they had still not arrived by 0pm , and we had to run to staples to buy substitutes which cost almost £_000 .
F	fast dlivery pleasant to talk and deal with
M	correct item , well_packaged , very quickly delivered .
F	the above_says it all . would definitely recommend
M	the cateye is excellent .
M	o0 has done this though i am surprised with the various ' blackspots ' in coverage in scotland & middle england compared to my wife who '_s phone is orange .
M	she was absolutely_delighted and we had a fantastic weekesn with no_hastle as all the booking was taken_care of for us by tickettree .
M	i will never see a deal like that again and they couldn_'_t care less despite me being there first and helping them fix their website , which in turn helped someone_else get these over me .
F	from now on ill be checking the sites thoroughly before purchasing anything .
M	then my 0nd dealing_with this company was just as farcical , firstly trying to use the prescription upload system which is clearly broken and then being told a week_later after i ' d already had an order confirmation_email_stating they are waiting for my prescription before they can send the items out , clearly not good enough in my book .
M	john . gibson .
F	i am upset and disappointed i had to take a day off work to go and pick my parcel up as well as the expense it cost me .
F	when i telephoned to enquire where he was i was told the appointment was been 0 and 00am – this does not appear very efficient , if a fitter does not arrive until 00am half the day is gone !
M	i have used them a few_times and would recommend them , especially on price .
M	. just using the color cartridges now !!
F	i then tried to get a refund , they claimed they had transferred the account from the old electricity_supplier , i contacted the old electricity_supplier , and they said never_heard of the transfer .
F	000_% complete_satisfaction .
F	all trees planted today by pen cantref community around the wildlife pond .
F	i '_ll be ordering more products from this company !
F	i '_ll definitely be using you again !
M	me : " so why has nobody bothered to let_me know its not coming today ?"
F	product fine , when it arrived .
F	this was not at my request , but on best bathroom '_s own initiative - but no - one told me .
M	in the past i '_ve got exactly_what i '_ve seen on the website , so this really shook me .
M	just usable but disappointing .
M	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
M	parcel arrived very quickly .
F	i live only 00 miles north of glasgow and am in central_scotland .
M	i can '_t even begin to describe the experience of these utter idiots .
M	when i asked the delivery man , whom i was having to help_unload the shed and carry it into the garden myself , how he was supposed to move the heavy bits on his own , he said " i have to slide them ".
M	after this experience , i can only_assume that my £ 0000 p . a grocery_shopping that have mostly been spent at asda is too insignificant to warrant any form of customer_care and as such i am happy to let my feet do the talking to a different retails .
F	thank_you
M	mistake on address translation to courier .
F	is it about time these types of companies and the courier they use were investigated to see how our valuable packages are actually handled ?
M	thank_you ,
F	i spent a day before christmas trying to order photo products .
F	the customer service and speed of delivery were both 0 - star .
M	stuff arrived quickly , price was good , what else can you ask for ?
F	beware , don_'_t pay for anything over_£_000 with adebit card their money back guarantee means nothing !
M	took a laptop in for a simple screen repair - covered by the " whatever_happens " insurance .
F	i did ask to speak with the customer service director / manager as i was not happy with the level of service i received and he told me i had to email in my complaint - i told him , i had tried that method but as they don_'_t respond to emails , this was pointless !
M	the web_site was exact and made finding the correct_memory for my machine easy .
M	regards
F	no way will i ever use or recommend this company and i will make_sure that i spread the word !
M	it got worse as i headed west along the m00 and i was getting desperate by the time 00 : 00 went past and i hadn_’_t even got as far as the m0 junction .
F	flowers always excellent .
M	seriously though . leave it alone now !
F	at_least i know they are in stock and will receive them .
M	this is all most perplexing and i wouldn_'_t say this is the easiest product to assemble !
F	a very efficient service .
F	i have used them 0 times_now and always receive exactly_what i need quickly .
M	i took his advice and got booked into my nearest_branch ( feltham ).
M	perhaps we were just expecting too much - after all it was a friday_afternoon and the driver might have been in a hurry to get home .
F	i was told i could send it back and once they received it , they would send out the green & white .
F	an_hour later , still no call back , eventually they leave a message to say my order is still out of stock and what would ilike them to do .
F	very happy with service and product although in an ideal world would have liked bigger choice of frame within my price bracket but having said that was able to make a satisfatory choice which i am happy with .
M	the instructions on the paper_work about where to drop_off were confusing and when we called for help were told something different completely .
F	( the sizes were different depending_on the brand ).
F	my parents had them professionally fitted into there home by a company and they commented on how better 000 blinds were in comparison to company fitted ones .
M	city - link could not operate outside the box by making up for their mistake by just delivering it when i requested , as they needed havens authorization to deliver the package on saturday ( apparently that cost extra ).
F	i got onto google , called a few companies and couldn_'_t get any valuable_advice .
M	on time , good rate of exchange , what more could you need ?
F	very impressed .
F	flights paid for now just need insurance .
M	these all arrived_safely and on time ( and the courier '_s tracking_system was superb !).
M	unable to purchase due to bank security check each time i try to make a purchase from gamesbite resulting in purchase being turned down untill check complete .
F	thanks mazuma
M	i then saw the same models of the items , that cash_converters made sure i missed out on due to their mess up , on their website again .
M	terrible customer service .
M	i bought a 00ft_trampoline in good faith having read about the quality of the product .
M	thanks again for excellent service
F	i choose certain flowers as they had sentiment to the person that was receiving them .
M	- did not respond to my email about changing delivery address , i called up directly but was told to email a certain address
M	i ordered some flavours for plain e_- liquid , which is hard to find at a reasonable price with a trusted company .
M	we purchased an ankle_support , which was fine , the speed of delivery and everything else was fine - except the packaging .
M	i received your lighting package in a week , but on installation the four downlighters blew , one after the other , within the space of a week .
F	this is the second time that the flowers have been left_outside .
M	haven_'_t been buying supplements in about a year and a half , and have moved to the uk from ireland so unsure as to where to buy from .
M	she said no but we will be with you shortly .
F	great service very straight_forward easy to follow once ordered you can get repeat order without_any hassle .
F	being dismissive really not good .
F	in the end i got 0 pairs of glasses worth £_00 each for a mere £_00 including delivery !
F	i love the email_updates telling_me where my package is .
F	0_stars perfectooooo : ) !!
M	i can '_t fault cult_pens .
M	i tried_calling but nobody ever answers .
F	my sister loved the flowers and the service good , unfortunately my only_complaint i have about serenata_flowers was the added card i requested .
F	we had a hard time getting answers when we asked questions .
F	they have gone in a charity box .
F	!
F	i had 0 nets 0 upstairs 0 downstairs , they were fab value for the money , i had what i asked for and got it , thank_you so much , i will shop again with you when i need xx
M	it closes at 0000_hrs !
M	sorry for my bad english .
M	thank_you victorian_plumbing .
F	i do feel that as there was a problem and i had not responded to the email , then surely a follow_up phone_call should have been actioned .
F	i have been a regular user of the super cigs for a few_years , i have found that the batteries seem to wear out very quickly and need throwing away , and as for the cartomizers thetop coating around the outside peels off very quickly again not being_able to be used properly it is all becoming very expensive to keep replacing them .
F	my son bought my husband and i a two night hotel break for christmas .
M	while in the store last friday00th i asked if it would be possible to purchase the 0 on show as the label said " take home today " and was told no .
M	just simple very good delivery as sheduled .
F	the coupon_code that won_'_t work , ergo our issue at hand ?
F	paid_extra for goods to be delivered in two_days never received the goods till a week_later missed the event that i was needing them for even after emails sent to company there was no explaination as to why the goods where late in arriving when i eventually received the goods one set was not working
M	their prices are competitive and they dispatch the order very promptly .
M	good price but attempted delivery to wrong_address .
F	why would you have to submit your telephone details on your account if not being used ?
M	if hmrc open the package and find out you have paid for this item , then you will be responsible for paying the import_duty etc , which makes it no cheaper_than a high_street shop ( without_any guarantees etc ).
F	the whole service was poor and the experience even worse .
F	so i had to ruin the surprise to be able to borrow money off husband and know what game to get .
M	i want to cut my contract with t - mobile as they don_'_t give you your moneys_worth .
F	a totally shocking and disgraceful experience .
F	the material of the blind is ok but the measurement of the material was one and half inches shorter that i had anticipated , a good job i was fitting the blind on the outer part of the window and had allowed a little_bit extra , otherwise it would have been too small .
F	i worked from home for a week to receive my item .
F	highly_recommended .
F	they blamed their computer_systems .
M	my shower is now working and the part only cost £ 0 !
F	decided to hold a tiki - themed cocktail_party to celebrate my 00th_birthday and as usual was on the last_minute ordering my decorations .
M	i have never been dissapointed !
M	so i wanted to pay via_paypal and send it to germany where i was staying on holiday .
M	i have also tried_contacting them 0 times on facebook and twice they have deleted my wall posts and have not responded to my status including them .
F	wouldn_'_t have been too bothered if it was for me but as a gift looked shoddy & as if it had already been opened .
M	on checking the email address they sent it to an e_- mail address that does not exist .
F	we knew where we wanted to go and she gave_us her advice and of course fantastic price and on no occasion were we pressurised to use the company or bombarded with telephone_calls which is what we had with other_companies .
M	bought three items in one batch to update my personal pc workstation :
F	lets play this game - i love games .
F	i phoned customer '_s service and the lack of understanding or sympathy for our plight was astounding !
M	scammers !
M	disappointment and a whole morning of my time wasted .
F	anette from denmark
F	would recommend to anyone .
F	would recommend this company
M	go go go . natalie parchment . in fact natalie if your single let_me know please ???
M	email enquiry responded to in good time .
M	the price match was honoured but points cannot be collected on price matched products , unlike_other_companies .
F	they deliver what they promised , cannot_fault them at all !
M	i must have spent over £ 0000 on your website and i '_m treated in a disgraceful manner .
M	both lenses were badly smudged with grunge as if the operative had spent the lunch hour changing the oil on their car without washing their hands before bodging a pair of glasses together .
F	i live in australia so the items on jules_b are very different from most clothing items we are exposed to down under !
F	so i had canceled my hotel_bookings from ebookers even_though i had to pay for the extra fees !
F	the only_reason i have not given 0_stars is that the creation software repeatedly came up with the message that some of my pages were blank , which made me quite nervous when it came to " order ".
M	price was good , coat was delivered quickly and as ordered . what more could you want !
F	advised they would sent missing meat and would be with us by friday .
F	i applied for my loan - staff were friendly and accommodating when i was told i was approved .
M	they always keep me informed .
M	i said to garage do you know you are recommended on tyreleaders web_site .?
F	okay , a bit disappointed the packaging was wet and damaged . luckily the canvas was unharmed .
F	let '_s just say that i have had issues with my broadband performance for some months now and when i contact them i am told incorrect information .
F	i '_ve shopped with active_beauty on and off for a number of years and i can '_t fault the customer service or value for money .
F	ranging_from £_000 - £_000 for the same amount of stuff and the same amount of men .
F	good quality organic seeds with a long sell - by date at a fair price .
M	the website is well_laid_out , the hard_sell technique in terms of additional items , ( vase , balloons etc ) are the only area that makes your site feel cheap and gimmicky .
M	i have requested a refund more times than i would like to count .
F	this is the second time i have used ao . com and will again i '_ve recommended ao . com to family_members and friends because of the price , quality , service , choice and overall excellent method of getting the good '_s you want .
F	all the change over , set_up and customer_care with a personal_touch was there .
F	i rang again !
M	they do not guarantee that they will supply you with tickets .
M	the roses were wilted and had brown spots all over them , the greenery also had brown spots and now after 0 days they lily '_s have finally open they are white when the ones pictured were two tone pink !
M	my honest view about powerbeck is they are amazing !
F	harlow
M	i suspect that i may be looking for more when certain works are done on the house and will be more than happy to return to roofing_superstore for them .
M	facebook a good place to start !!!!!
M	i just ordered and received some window deflectors and thought they could be fitted straight_away .
M	good quality product at a good price .
F	it wasn_'_t until i asked if any bio tone had been delivered and we checked the order number that we realised it was my order .
F	secondly , my blinds are brilliant white and the stiffening bars used to construct the blind are off - white and therefore look yellowish through the blind .
M	the box seemed to have been walked on so i cannot blame the depot , potentially this was damaged by the courier that the blinds depot employed .
F	the prices were substantially_lower , so i was a little_bit_worried_about the quality but my fears were groundless .
M	i would be a credible excuse .
F	unfortunately , the order did not arrive for another 0_days .
F	i have e_mailed you as only payment shows on credit_card statement & not the credit .
F	the flowers that i received were beautiful and they kept me in the loop with regards to delivery .
F	the products are probably cheaper because they have a short_shelf_life , there is nothing wrong with the product but be careful if you are stocking up on an item .
M	their deals are great , and always buy one get one free .
F	as i know these tickets have been released and people on ebay seem to have them in there hands already .
M	first time , i was sent a fake ' replica ' item .
F	my order was delivered promply .
M	after i had put on the space_saver , i got home to look for a replacement tyre .
M	admittedly we made changes to our requirements or if not changes then additions ( as in spending more money ).
F	in fairness , having made my disappointment apparent in the form of an e_- mail , they were quick to respond and i received a full_refund .
M	yours unimpressed clive
M	they were delivered very quickly .
F	sausages etc .
F	bought both worming_tablets and flea_treatment for my 0 cats , flea treating the cats is easy but the worming i have to resign myself today is the day , as most people that own cats trying to get something into a cats mouth is a major_issue , though drontal is a great wormer , i just wish they would make the tablets either smaller or a tablet that a cat would eat willingly , its quite an ordeal when i have to worm my lot , some easier than others but because the tablets are quite big its hard to always get it down their throats , succesfully did all cats the last time to find a tablet on the floor which cat i do not know as i thought i had successfully done them all so who ever the culprit was this time maybe i will be more observant and not let them out of my sight until i am happy it has indeed gone done their throat ( lesson_learnt ).
M	although it was known the item i ordered was not in stock and had to be ' shipped in ' i wasn_'_t informed of this .
M	free delivery good too . but don_'_t put 00 / 00 hr delivery when in actually takes 0 / 0 days .
F	i ordered a canon ixus 000 camera and was able to track its delivery until i received it fairly quickly .
F	my exprience of 0000rpm has always been and i hope will_continue to be reliable , professional , quality and great budgeted company .
M	i ring again .
F	received goods day after est .
M	0 .
F	# notstupid
M	i still ended_up booking , with no added perks to compensate for the mis_- quote , which was a bit_annoying .
F	the software was easier to use than with other website companies but the product hasn_'_t arrived yet so i can '_t comment further on quality etc
M	and if you decide that , after_reading this , you no_longer want me as a customer well .
M	printer arrived next_day and works_perfectly , i had £_00 cashback and a 0 year_guarantee what great deal !
M	ordering tyres from these_people is easy and after_searching the net , i found to be the best deals , but if you need to return an item its a standard charge of £_00 .
F	very happy with service would reccomend
M	the flowers were of good quality and enough stems .
M	they were quick to replace though at a price that was competitive , so worked out ok in the end .
F	just deliver it when you said you will .
M	" 0_stars : acceptable experience but with some friction ."
F	they were supposed to be sent with presents to cape_town , australia and new_zealand before xmas .
F	it was so easy to order , and very fast delivery , i will_definately be ordering from them again .
M	i remember the first time i logged in to facebook , amazingly just 0 - 0 years_ago or so and was intrigued by the concept , it was all so new but was also still in it '_s infancy so i soon lost interest and didn_'_t visit it again for over a year !
F	further_action is most definitely needed !!!!
F	the whole_process of ordering was easy , the items came in super quick time .
F	both_times spoke to friendly staff who explained they can come the day before the event , it '_s the individual who has sold viagogo the ticket who hasn_'_t sent them to me yet ( they contacted the seller on the 00st_may to ship them to me , so i dont understand_why the seller holds on to them for so long ).
M	sorry folks , but you did ask !
M	whilst they give you the impression that there are no credit_checks , there are and very lengthy detailed discussion around that .
F	very quick responses were made to my initial_enquiry .
M	it '_s easy to forget too that when it comes to online shopping - all shops are not equal .
F	obviously i should have done this but i mistakenly believed that , after admitting that it was their mistake , they would treat us fairly .
M	the delivery is exemplary , with items usually arriving within 0 days of purchase .
M	best price around for cortaflex ha with a very simple re - ordering facility .
F	:)
M	their range of clothing and other fashion is second to none in the uk .
F	she was delighted that it fits and works great .
M	they say they have a 0 day satisfaction_guarantee but they don_'_t honour this !!!
F	the quality of the brushes were fantastic and i will_definately be ordering from here again .
F	the pork and madeira dish was pleasant enough but my daughter didn_'_t like it at all .
M	the company phoned me back and have offered a refund but are looking in to my claims over the glasses .
F	like it !!
F	the flowers were left_outside at the front_door .
M	beware also a noticeable snobbishness in favour of petrol and against electric models !
F	the estimated delivery time was 0 / 0_days .
M	the quality of the worktop is excellent .
M	pricing is good on the whole but often find stuff cheaper_elsewhere and recently sent price notice for a microwave that was £_00 cheaper on another site ( with free next_day delivery !)
F	to say that the driver was rude and unhelpful to passengers is putting it mildly .
F	terrible i still have not received my purchase from this company
F	then the second time i phoned because via_e . mail they were unwilling to send me one , the person i spoke to was quite rude and told me a different_story to the first person i spoke to .
M	they overload your mailbox with way too much spam !
M	i think the least i should have been offered was an_alternative at the same price .
F	i almost didn_'_t receive the product as the corner of the envelope was split with the rods hanging out and had burst through the courier plastic envelope , but lucky all the rods were received .
F	limbo .
M	simply submit your details for your tickets .
F	used this firm before very satisfied with the service and flowers
F	they were not .
F	this is incredible service , in my opinion , as i live in rural sa .
F	so i go to their wesbsite and see ' chat ', i think wow , this is amazing i can get immediate answers and actions .
F	ever .
M	bought two lighting nets and a teddy_bear .
M	i have no idea of the service as not got my goods yet ?
F	i was recently looking around to buy a bmw in the chesterfield store , i was brousing the cars outside for quite a while and not one member of staff came out to assist me , they were clearly too busy chatting inside .
F	flowers were lovely , although a stem is broke .
M	however a week_later , on 00 november i received another note from the royal_mail informing_me that another parcel was waiting for me in the depot .
F	they use a 0000 number so im not going to keep ringing them , it will cost me a small_fortune !
F	since tiscali was taken over by talk_talk , more_expensive poor products , bad service , non - existant customer service , impossible to contact anyone , slow slow slow connection via broadband , keep selling me extra products that never materialise .
F	have been on the sofa watching stupid tv shows all day long waiting for the driver , he never came !!!!
M	returned car as agreed to malpensa terminal one .
F	the car_park seems to be so far away from the airport and the buses not as frequent as it could be , but these are things that can be overlooked for the excellent price .
F	he apologised for any inconvenience_caused .
F	well_packed , good dvd and instruction_manual , easy to set_up and a dream to use .
M	previously bought battlefield_0 limited_edition , just bought shogun 0 . cheaper_than steam and instant service . what more can you ask for ?
M	we had to cancel the policy and get a refund .
M	a 000_% mark up , extortionate .
F	my friend was very pleased and said they where lovely - i haven_'_t seen them though .
M	although my account shows a credit balance of over £_000 i get debt_collection_agency calls and letters !
F	tried online_chat and was given an 0 minute response time for my query , over an_hour later i still hadn_'_t had a response and i was number 0 in the queue !
F	a book under 0 side has made it stand firm .
M	good prices too !
F	anyway after over 0_months disappointment , i had had enough and i contacted my bank and had to fill out some forms detailing all my emails and the correspondence i got back from them , and i received refund in full from my bank , we then managed to buy a 0ds much_cheaper with extra games from well_known high_street store .
M	phoned up to be told it was delivered and fedex have a signature , but no one we know has that name including neighbours .
F	not happy at the moment !
M	had to go home and wait all morning for a phone_call to say the others were in .
F	i love_primark stuff , it doesn_'_t really last more than a year but i change my style so much anyway it does '_t matter !
F	contacted talk_talk passed from one person to another nobody had a clue then to be told their online service was very easy to use and i should have dates ???
F	however , delivery took a long time .
M	emailed hannants requesting return and refund , and was completely_ignored .
F	she said she '_d put the refund through and said " yeah they '_ll probably give you a 00_%_discount thats usually what they do .
M	there are few explanations on the grammar and structure of sentences which is one of the main crucial areas of learning a language .
M	this led to a delivery not being cancelled as requested .
M	postage_costs seemed ok .
F	my mum_loved the flowers she received and the choice serenata offers makes it really easy to treat someone special .
F	there is indeed some justice in the world .
M	ease of ordering , communication , reliability and speed all spot on .
F	i found the ordering process misleading .
M	more options on colour would be nice .
M	i was not made aware that to qualify you can not mix medication and toiletries to qualify for free delivery
M	postage was expensive for a flute and i sent an email questioning this but never received a reply .
F	0 .
M	several unhelpful phone_calls later , visits to shops & live_chats has resulted_in me finding out that vodafone take 00_hours to update your data , no two service representatives give you the same answer , 00 hour call back on escalations means 0 working_days & not 0 days like you would expect , 0 attempts to call back does not exist , two of my escalations have resulted_in callbacks of 0 attempts in about 0 min & 0 attempt which the network dropped me !!!
F	can '_t fault the service i got tho .
F	dreadful .
M	is anyone_else interested in attending the offices in birmingham together with the local media ?
F	still_haven_'_t received my order , no card was left to say whether it was tried to be delivered never received an_email to say when it should be with me by .
F	nothing at all like the bouquet i ordered .
M	i have used this branch on a number of occasions now and would recommend them to anyone i know .
F	which never turned_up .
M	another longer established web based company in the same market has_been taken over by a large chain , opened shops and allowed its business model to change to the more mainstream retail offering e . g .
M	i bought brakes and protective gear from merlin and they were cheaper_than anywhere_else .
F	i hadtoorder somelast week from somewhere_else , they delivered in0 days .
M	will come_back now i ' v found it
F	on a postive note physio_room replied the next worlking day apologising and sent an e_mail with a collect_+ returns_label so i was able to send it back free of charge .
M	initially the price was around £_00 (£_000 total_cost ) more_expensive but with a cheaper and perhaps more appropriate paper the price came down to what i considered more acceptable .
M	i want to feel that i am a known customer to them otherwise it is easy enough to go to any other site and book through them afresh
M	this is the first time i have bought this system from the under_floor heating store and they have delivered on all fronts .
F	wish you could give no stars .
M	avoid !
M	jag betalade 00 kr för_att prova ett par skor som_var för stora i storleken .

F	: 0 (
M	all goods delivered after 00_hrs with the driver calling 00mins before delivery .
M	in december_0000 they randomly extracted over £_000 from my account without_any notice or production of a bill .
F	was also impressed with the tracking_information and delivery .
M	thank_you so much , you saved the day and it was so easy , i loved the email update .
F	packaging was very over the top , vast quantity of packaging and huge volume of polystyrene packaging used when air bags would have been much_better .
F	my gripe is communication or lack of it .
F	i have no idea .
M	each item is excellent quality as expected from procook .
F	dear steve , many_thanks for your reply .
M	they are satisfied that the actual size is not mentioned in your email .
F	it would be easier for all concerned if customers could pick a date as part of the ordering process as on other_websites .
F	i thought about it for months .
F	order on a saturday for delivery for a monday between 0 . 00 - 00 . 00 and finally receiving your order after 0 emails . at 00 . 00 . disguisting service , would never recommend to a friend .
M	customer focus company ( cfc )
F	period .
F	the keys arrived within a few_days and worked_perfectly .
M	left sheffield florist at 00 : 00 , but did not arrive until after 00 : 00 in sheffield .
F	was i spoilt by the first quicker delivery ?
M	rock and run are consistently excellent , orders are shipped on time and arrive securely_packaged , delivered by royal_mail , who keep you informed when they are going to deliver and just get it done , and just to round it off ask for feedback , just in case there are any_problems .
F	i never complained and just thought that it was due to the location i was in .
M	despite this being entirely their error , they could not guarantee correcting their error in time to help our cat .
F	next_day delivery no_probs at all .
F	thanks a lot .
F	i told her it had squeezed in before but she said no , her computer did not accept vehicles beyond 0 metres in height .
F	no communication at all from them .
F	the occurrence of wrong units and pieces of the kitchen being delivered became common dragging the fitting of the kitchen from 0 week to almost 0_months !!!!
M	bought the leggings for my wife '_s birthday .
M	this is the 0nd time i '_ve_used myvetmeds and if anything the service was even better this time - probably because i bought two lots of medicine so saved on postage_costs .
F	i will never order anything through them again .
M	it was valued for insurance_purposes at £_00 , 000
M	brilliant i thought , good job shopto .
M	frontline is a great product and a fantastic price compared to vets / and tescos / sainsburys which were almost double the price in there stores and very helpful customer service and fast delivery i highly_recommend them
F	i emailed straight_away and rang first thing this morning only to be told that it was not possible to amend the delivery address as the order had been processed even_though the delivery is not going to be delivered until tomorrow .
M	he offered to rebook me with an " on airport " rental company - both of whom were served by the bus i was stood waiting for .
M	i got an email_telling_me it would be thursday .
M	i usually buy it from ebuyer but on this occasion gogodigital '_s price was too good to ignore .
M	its a joke
M	now i am on their website trying to close my account .
M	fantastic , dispatched really quickly and cheapest on the internet
M	we wanted a phone line , although as we use mobiles mainly so this was not as important as broadband .
M	pc was unpacked with every part as ordered , and up and running within_00mins .
F	would buy again !
M	can '_t tell you how good the molaclean company are , i ordered from them for the first time and within 0 days i had received my order and wow they are better_than the top_brands , great product i will_definitely use them again .
F	kept up dated with despatch and delivery
F	i recommend it to ex - pats who are marmite addicts and miss some of the other british home_comforts that you can '_t find abroad .
F	they then charge a minimum of 00 pounds to send it back if you reject their offer .
F	00_hours_later , the flowers were left at the back door .
M	it was let within a week .
M	real tasty steaks and nice chicken to
F	if you dare take out a contract with talktalk and there are any_problems - you are on a one way ticket to stressville , and talktalk won_'_t give a jot .
F	i was very surprised that the package arrived so early - within a couple of days of placing the order .
M	i was a bit_confused and questioned it .
F	the quality is excellent .
F	which is ' nt what you would of expected !
M	clubs ordered simply and at speed ( they are for my father in law - i know nothing about the technical terms , etc but they were very good to talk me though ).
M	the interior was dirty and there was rubbish in glove_box and storage places .
F	was a little disappointed with the flowers that my partner received , they didn_'_t really look much like the description on the website and i didn_'_t feel i got very good value for money .
M	unfortunately there was a queue of people waiting to go through the insurance sales routine in front of me and each one took 00_minutes so with just one person on the desk , it was an_hour before i could drop_off the papers .
M	great service and fast delivery just in time for mothers_day easy and fast transaction look_forward to buying more products from you
F	will never use these people again nor will l recommend them to anyone .
F	my grandaughter has not received the goods yet
M	:)
F	sorry millets , i am unlikely to shop at millets again because i don_’_t use shops that have refund hassles .
M	all he kept saying when i pointed_out problems and issues was ' yeah , i '_ll take that on the chin '.!
F	couldn_'_t expect or get more , was really pleased
M	they tend to deliver on time .
M	beat the online competition and super_fast delivery , love my kicks and will_definitely be using urban_industry again .
F	" we apologize for the delay of the design samples .
M	bought a suite , 00 / 0 / 00 , delivered 00 / 00 /_0000 .
F	she actually found out that my refund was never processed in the first place , and that she had to start the process again . which could take up to 00 working_days !!
M	the coach ride was comfortable and the guide was knowledgeable and offered information at many places along the way .
F	the prices are also fantastic .
F	i also tried one of the raw_chocolate_bars , i think , with cherries , and i found it really nice : fresh , melting , full cocoa flavour .
M	getting a refund , or else my bank is getting involved .
M	also when i ordered i chose to checkout as a guest , but they created an account for me anyway , showing total_disregard for my choice .
F	they have shown themselves to be unable to deal with anything outwith the norm .
F	00 hour delivery - just perfect .
M	waited in for a third day and at last the desk was gone .
F	very quick to deliver and professional .
M	i would not recommend purchasing anything from this site unless you want to spend hours hanging on the phone or days ( 0 to be precise !)
M	and received everything the following_day .
M	thankyou rxsport .
M	can '_t fault the bouquet which is good value for money and greatly_appreciated by my mum .
F	l . there is no such place as bailgate apartments .
F	also the address on the direct_debit mandate is wrong !
F	well i dont_know about you !
M	huge_selection of products and the prices are very competitive with the other supply stores .
M	found blinds0go while looking for a replacement blind for our kitchen .
M	it has_been 00 days since order was placed and i have received no refund .
F	at this stage im at boiling point as it seems impossible to speak to anyone and get what i need .
F	so you need to make_sure what the descriptions are
F	i called them , oh bring it back we will check it out , free of charge !!
F	the seal could have been sent in a much smaller package to avoid this , i was impressed at first because of the prompt delivery but it has cost me far too much in the end so i will not be making the same mistake again .
F	obviously not very important to them .
F	' where '_s my summerhouse ?'.
M	apparently manufacturer would call us with eta .
F	we ordered a bike from them for my sons brithday .
F	fab store , so glad i found it .
M	only that they will try to get you tickets and if they fail to do so they may give you your money back .
F	!
F	surely not ?
F	to get set_up to advertise ( among other things ) you have to put in the address of your property .
M	customer service could be much_better : i had my bike serviced 0 months_ago at the waterloo branch of evans_cycles .
M	i had ordered the quick step arte laminate_flooring and they were delivered at a good price and the quality was top_class .
M	if i could rate them with 0_stars , i would !
F	system sould not take order if can '_t deliver !
M	love them .
M	bay fitted , though i removed the " contact " plate from the leads , and solder on a much longer lead .
F	from showroom to delivery service was superb .
F	i can never get the sizes i want & the choices & styles are not half as good as they used to be .
M	why was the connector not sold with the pump , as had been done originally ?
M	use powerbeck they won_'_t let you down !
F	update_:
F	easy to install ram
M	it has an easy to navigate webpage which made ordering straight_forward .
M	i called dpd and they said it would not be delivered until tuesday 0rd_jan no reason given .
F	the flowers arrived in a crushed box , heads off some of the flowers and i have tried 0 times to contact serenata_flowers to be sent a message i cannot open .
F	i couldn_'_t_believe_how easy it was to get a new tyre which is something i normally hate to do !!
F	another issues where we found was unnecessary was the cost of postage .
M	letters never acknowledged .
M	i used the mobile fitting service and the technician called to agree the time of the installation and arrived when he said he would .
M	when we had to expand the trip from 000 to 000 due to massive sign up numbers , they allowed_us to do so within 0 days of finding out we needed more spaces which took a huge_amount of pressure off us as a committee ( a lot of people were very annoyed that they werent in the first 000 ).
F	so far so good .
M	also the seller of whom i had paid £ 0 . 00 for delivery of the bluetooth device never refunded my £ 0 . 00 despite several emails and phone_calls .
F	what was delivered was very poor substitute - cheap flowers and wrapping .
M	i phoned the 0nd company trying to tell them how ridicilous is that and a young_girl in her 00s picked_up the phone telling_me “ those enterprise disks are out of stock so they decided to send me these ”.
M	regards
F	when we picked_up the car there was no one on hand to show us how to use it .
M	the final email from the complaint said " i '_m sorry there is nothing we can do ".
F	no personal service or communication .
F	sent fo the phone to replace exiting hand set , easy to order and speedy delivery .
F	i haven_'_t received my delivery !
M	generally excellent products more often than not backed by long guarantees - good quality , even if not well_known_brands which get good reviews for specifications .
F	constant phone_calls and unanswered email messages all to no_avail , l am still_waiting .
M	the repair took a week but other than that great .
M	in my opinion , when an e_- mail is sent stating the delivery day it should most definitely be delivered on that day .
M	the store say they are not informed of the date of despatch , so there is every chance that orders are being lost / stolen or misplaced !
F	i bought quite a few items from tooled_- up . com and delivery costs and price of the goods themselves were really good .
F	i finally gave in and had the excess covered because i was so afraid of everything .
M	company lost that sale .
F	unfortunately despite cancelling my account , i have since been charged_twice .
M	james_villas shame on you
M	without a fault so ended_up ordering from alternate supplier
M	i bought a clearence item stupidly assuming it would be ok to use , when it arrived the expiry_date was 00 / 00 ( over 0 . 0years_ago ), ok so i didn_'_t read the small_print prior to purchase , whatever , i '_m ok with losing the ££!!
M	simply awesome .
M	customers should not have to put up with the standards of delivery service offered by nightfreight and i advise people to think again before buying from companies that use this service .
M	this is a review of my experience of ' optical_express customer service ' relating to the refund of a deposit for laser_eye_surgery .
M	00 hour delivery arrives more 00 later .
F	when i contacted serenata , i got the most robotic , inhuman responses i '_ve ever_seen from a brand .
F	another delivery slot has_been arranged without_consulting me .
F	this was the first time i '_d ordered from gear for girls ; the customer_services was pro - active and positive , the products were high_quality .
M	that '_s all i ask and these_guys provide both .
F	really good quality waistcoat , excellently_priced and speedily delivered .
M	sent my phone undamaged and when it arrived the screen was broken so even_though it was not my fault my payment went down from £_00 to £_00 .
F	there are some great discounts and delivery is fast .
F	vi købte 0 netkabler og 0 hmdi stik , og varerne blev_leveret til os næsten dagen_efter ( da vi_bestilte varerne sent om aftenen !
M	i ' d recommend them to you , i know i '_ll use them again !
F	they really screwed_up my delivery by failing ensure that the correct instructions were on the parcel .
M	further , if it were possible , that e_- mail should state if it was going to be delivered in the morning or afternoon .
F	so not the best place for our first ever visit to scotland !
F	on the second order i recieved a text to day that the parcel was with the courier , but it didn_'_t come that day .
M	must be able to compare net price after cashback with other comparison results - especially true of financial sector credit_cards insuraqnce etc .
F	was sent broken and packaging was awful .
F	in the mean time i have requested a refund on several_occasions .
F	we would be lost without them .
M	if this goes on much longer then we should all take legal_action and retrieve the money through our credit_cards .
F	unfortunately i didn_'_t notice this until i had given it to my mum on mothers_day .
M	they have not responded to my e_- mails and will not answer the call .
F	had a issue with one pair not having the " reading " side of the prescription , i contacted glasses_direct and they asked me to return them .
F	this time , they call on the morning of the delivery and say that the item ( s ) are still unavailable , and that it is a short_notice cancellation because it only just showed up on the systems .
F	service was very good with speed and good packaging on item .
F	i '_m a bit gutted about the rash , as i would have liked to carry on for another week or so and lose a bit more .
M	usenext - subscribers will come and go .
F	i think that '_s what she said !!!
F	i '_ve not received a reliable service from this company . and putting the blame on a vendor is not the answer .
F	a very user - friendly website with a good selection of bouquets .
F	0 jan_0000 00 : 00 : 00_pm cambridge_cambridgeshire gb delivery attempted
F	ordered my mep code for my curve 0000 , 0_days_later nothing .
M	i have requested them to discuss the potential serious nature of this in the next team meeting with staff "
M	brittany is the most beautiful part of france - and thankfully time has passed it by .
F	time . wasters with no compassion !
M	up to the last journey encountered no_problems at all .
F	instructions were vague and misleading .
F	we paid total balance when ordering sofa on 00 / 00 / 00 advised by salesman it would be with us in 00 weeks at the very latest probably before .
F	this is totally_unacceptable and we will not be using this company again .
M	i just wish the web_site had been up to date regarding returns .
F	my husband them called them again to tell them that i had made a mistake in what i was trying to tell them and he was told that someone would call him back .
M	i intend to press charges
M	fast , efficient and good value .
F	sorry for lengthy review .
M	be ware !!
M	it is also a large comfortable sofa in its own right .
F	my husband patiently_explained the need for soap on oil stains in the kitchen , but when we came home to find the bathrooms dripping in water everywhere - with water stains on every tap and mirror - we decided we couldn_'_t be responsible for his entire training .
F	they are friendly and their site is very easy to use .
M	their staff at the shop and resorts are extremely professional and very helpful and even . pleasant !
M	clearly these_people are happy to send out rubbish and ignore any complaints in the hope that people will give up .
F	felt bullied_into buyinv more than i wanted .
F	first one managed to find someone_else to purchase it have just returned 0nd item for exchange so need to wait and see what_happens .
M	ordering on line was effortless .
F	i still have not recieved my refund
F	he then shouted down the phone as he read me the terms and conditions of a ticket which i did not want !
F	the product is good , although it is available cheaper elsewhere , and the delivery was quick .
F	good quality product and timely delivery .
F	probably_wouldn_'_t use again .
M	refund finally received at the end of january , so not a scam but seriously bad service .
F	the response was quick & i was kept_informed of the progress all the time .
F	the clocks are excellent quality - better_than i imagined .
F	next time i will simply collect from the post_office or just pay the extra for the postage to home .
F	ordered a brand_name watch_strap , website said 0 - 0 working_days , arrived the next_day .
M	a phone_call resulted_in a specific date by which delivery would be made .
F	when i reordered the plant went to a different address than on the form .
F	had everything i wanted , where alot of places
M	looking neat and professional was the idea behind making the acquisition in the first place .
F	the tuxedo arrived on the wednesday_morning , within the time_slot fantastic customer service from_start to finish .
F	the staff were very polite and helpful .
F	after 0_months i called again and was told 00 days i have now been waiting for more than 00 days .
F	i ordered oral_b toothbrush_heads at £_00 . 00 from this company on may 0th and delivery was promised ain 0 - 0_days .
M	top service .
M	- i had to pay for accommodation in sydney for a night .
M	eventually it got sorted no thanks to either bigdug or uk mail .
F	would highly_reccomend .
M	they scammed me into paying twice then wouldnt deliver the item .
F	also highly_recommended !
F	brilliant product .
F	after having problems tracking down the journey my parcel was taking and intrigued by the length of time it had taken for it to come to a standstill mid transit i contacted parcel0go agent katie .
M	the date for delivery had apparently been set for several_years previously , and the rep implied that the error must have been caused_by user fault with my laptop date being incorrect .
F	i recently brought some flip_flops from rubbersole but ordered the wrong_size .
F	they said they would need me to send everything back , including the phone .
F	the clothes were fine but all the same size ordered but some were bigger_than others but all in all very good
F	i have been looking_forward to this for months .
M	when its clearly the courier at fault .
M	i stumbled_across tyre_shopper - bit_dubious as never_heard of them before but realised the fitting service would be with national .
F	dealing_with this company is an_absolute_nightmare - the very worst online shopping_experience i have ever had .
F	ordering was stright_forward and the order arrived very quickly , well_packed and undamaged .
M	i have no_complaints , but a suggestion .
M	overall i got good money for my phone and the turnaround was quick as promised , but watch out for the small_print .
M	what this is basically is you go to a different website where its listed for cheaper , supplement_warehouse doesn_'_t just match the price , it gives you it for much less .
F	would not order by internet again .
M	what a joke !
M	i found this a very demanding site , that with one wrong move your in court being billed
F	love this site the prices are great and very very reasonable and reliable !
M	!
M	recently we have had to replace our washing_machine and decided to try the same company again .
F	after receiving no response i contacted wowcher again only to be advised that miss amazing are no long able to fulfill the deal .
M	the flowers were delivered on time however the arrangement was nothing like the online picture and appeared to be a bit of a ' rush job '
M	frustrating , time wasting and because it could not be completed om - line it has cost me £_00 . 00 .
M	!
F	no request was too hard .
M	national_tyres in broughty ferry however were rude , of poor service and slow .
F	i was lucky it was basins and not my shower_tray etc ( ordered elsewhere ) otherwise the refit would have been held up .
F	the first time all the washers were replaced , then the whole workings had to be replaced and not from bathshop but wickes .
M	i ran a taste test making a cup of nespresso ( n ) and fine_coffee_club ( fcc ) coffee and placing the cups next to each other .
M	as soon as i have received it i will send you a confirmation e_- mail .
M	had i known , i would have waited the extra day .
M	ordered my rear breaking system from jk the service was brill very well_packed very quick delivery sensibly_priced a0 .
M	this is not a company i would recommend
F	the site itself is a good idea and reasonably easy to navigate after a while however the constant changes with lack of respect for what the users want is disgraceful .
M	i stumbled upn festive_lights and found that the site was easy to navigate and each page contained good information on what you require and if you needed a power pack they told you which one was required .
M	great .
M	i '_ve_used printer_basics for my kodak esp0 for several_years_now and have never had any problem whatsoever .
F	overall i am impressed and would use the service again .
M	i will always keep them at top of my list .
M	from finding the web_site , the experience was first_class .
M	had looked around for a good value towbar and found this site .
M	i posted the phone on a thursday and had the money in my account by friday lunch time !
M	they had wilted not very happy at all , will have to think if i will purchase withyou again as they arenot value for money .
F	perfect flowers for birthday .
M	thankfully i got the medals in time for my event but feel you should be aware of my experience .
M	the recipient was very pleased with the flowers
F	very good service .
F	when i was googling the product i was looking for ' chemistdirect ' came up and seemed to be cheaper_than everybody else .
M	expensive returns_policy and took_ages for refund , had to chase it 0 times , took .
M	they agreed to replace both packs on the friday as no one was to be home on the thursday to allow the damaged shelves to be picked_up .
F	she specifically_asked for the shoes and i looked on clark '_s and then debenhams and they had sold out on both !
F	i would advice this to anyone .
M	i am not happy that i spent a substantial_amount on these flowers and they are rubbish
F	it arrived 0_days_later and was amazing !
F	i '_m lucky i paid through paypal as i '_m opening a dispute !
F	unfortunately he didn_'_t know this until be bought the gift .
M	not what one wishes when disembarking from a flight and anxious to be on our way .
M	i bought 0 tickets for manchester big reunion tour on morning sat 0 may , received 0hr later by e ticket , then went to concert at 0pm same day to be told that the tickets had been cancelled by previous_owner that morning shortly_after i had bought them , nothing could be done at the arena as they have no control over viagogo , so had to purchase further 0 tickets , original ones were at the front we are now situated at the back , viagogo close at 0pm on sat so contacted paypal following_day and emailed viagogo to tell them what happened , payment been accepted but paypal opened up a case which takes 00 days , viagogo sent claim_form through email which has to be sent back in 0 days or they will not deal with it , this took 0 days to try and open as no software to open the attachment , email it bk no response , fax it back nope dead line , phoned them sat at 0pm sorry all lines closed erm 00am till_0pm advertised times , use thier website to contact its just a maze of random confusing questions which sends you anywhere , all you can do is email the same thing as you had done 0 days previous , as they say on thier webpage they pay the seller immediatly after thier tickets being sold but trying to get your money back or proper response is unbelievable .
M	with an item as large as this , it was slightly_annoying that it was delivered a day earlier_than originally advised .
F	i found the website very easy to use with lots of added_extras_included to enhance the photo '_s i had taken .
F	i had travelled down myself for the opening , paying for 0 nights in a hotel plus travel .
F	payment is easy to process and so it is just the difficulty of accessing one '_s account that remains a problem at times and not finding help to resplve this easily found .
F	unfortunately , even these panels did not produce their full output as specified , but more_importantly the construction was such that when water entered one of the so - called sealed panels it shorted its internal electronics , which in turn shorted the battery bank of three batteries it was charging , completely destroying their charging capability .
M	they are even taking pictures of the snow !!!
F	i have reported this to the telephone team but no action has_been taken .
M	had a claim in since last october , at last in april they say they have sent a payment to my paypal_account ----- but they haven_'_t ( 00 days_later ).
F	i cannot_comment on their flowers as i haven_'_t seen any but i would not recommend serenata to anyone .
F	i am having to return tge diary i ordered from you as the skin of thecover has bee cut too small leaving unseemly gaps on the corners which i know will fray .
F	really good quality clothes but rubbish customer service .
M	he refused to replace the exhaust unless it fails its mot .
M	happy to report nothing of the sort with redhot sunglasses .
F	it was the first time i ordered from spartoo as they had such a good deal on with the ugg_boots i wanted .
F	what really stood_out was the great email communication , i was never left_wondering the status of any enquiry .
F	teenage_boys are long on the arms but still have small chest size - maybe you could do a youth size ?
F	very disappointed with this company and will definitely never order again .
M	it should not cost 00_euros to replace a tyre and it should not cost anything like the fees quoted if something went wrong with the car .
M	was quoted between £_000 and £_000 , then the price came in at £_000 plus_vat !!
F	ordered keys lunchtime and they arrived the following_day .
M	thats what service should be .
M	the woman employee on arrival failed to confirm return time with us which caused delay on leaving , she also failed to inform us on how we gained fast track in the airport ( which we had purchased ).
F	i understand you raised concerns that shiply . com was misleading because it was not clear from the front pages that shiply ’_s fee will be returned to a user ’_s account as time - limited credit if a job is cancelled .
M	in all the service delivers and is great for both tutors and learners but the search experience could be so much_better .
F	i always make_sure i have a good stock now .
F	i did not feel that the customer service was great - it took rentify a relatively long time to respond to my email queries , and then did not respond to all queries , and i had to chase on several_occasions .
M	to date ( nearly one week_later ) and after 0 emails and reports to myprotein no response has_been provided except an auto response from customer_services acknowledging_receipt of my complaint .
M	i have used holidayautos for many_years and have always found them reasonably_priced and providing reliable service in europe and the usa .
M	sounds_like a shoddy outfit run by people who dont care what service they supply .
M	the ordering procedure was easy and straightforward and delivery was only two_days_later .
F	i was annoyed because the day i booked it i waited in all day with the intention of going out the next_day but had to wait in again .
M	only bought because wife really keen to go .
F	flowers were delivered on time and were greatly_appreciated .
F	it is really against my nature to post a bad_review , but a response from the company was in my opinion the least i could expect .
F	a very disappointing experience all_round & i '_m £_000 . 00 out of pocket .
M	i was therefore surprised to receive the larger cover .
M	thanks .
M	not impressed at all .
M	good researching to you all !
M	but when things go_wrong no one knows where the deliveries are , when they will get here and when they have gone_missing , i get you save_money sending them in bulk from what ever third world country makes them but it doesn_'_t work .
F	commentary got repetitive .
F	very sadly we will not be ordering another lot this year at such inflated pricing .
M	this is an average site .
F	this was made known to you at the time , but before it was due to be delivered i received an_email_saying unless i put the old freezer outside ( over one step ) from my porch , then you wouldn_'_t deliver my new one .
F	how lucrative it must be to own a huge company where a considerable_amount of what you offer for sale you do not stock . then unsuspecting twerps like me , who do not read the reviews , order such items , in my case with a value of over_£_000 , and guess_what , the company is unable to supply the item . oh_yes they will inform you quickly enough , and offer something_else , or a refund , but not before they have grabbed your money . the name of the game is then to hang on to it for as long as possible , in my case a month despite_being told that the money would be refunded to my pay_pal account on two occasions . needless to say i am still_waiting , and will have the hassle of entering into a dispute . companies like this will sail very close to the wind unless the law moves to plug these glaring sharp practices . i think the black_hole contains too many of their victims , and hope that you the reader will beware . glenda kirby . devon
F	great service , great product .
M	when i called i was informed that the courier had tried to deliver but couldn_'_t i am not interested in these differing_opinions .
F	everything organised in the time frames i requested and accommodation alternatives offered - some we took and others we organised ourselves .
M	i would have give 0_stars otherwise .
F	what a load of rubbish that is , the cost of pillows is under_£ 0 .
F	i would probably try someone_else first now instead of ordering from here again .
F	not happy and awaiting photo to send to serenata :-(
M	i am utterly threaders with having to relearn where everything is every few_months , and as for you deciding what you think i might find important , well . you ain '_t god dude .
M	i made the point that i doubted the date i actually had available would be free then but apparently there was nothing she could do about it .
M	no apology or offer of half the amount back as a good will gesture ?
F	very good products , which were quickly and easily dispatched .
M	do not book with credit_card , you will be surcharged and they don_'_t tell you until after the booking is confirmed .
M	but after sending all the information on how it would work , out to mine , it was plain_sailing .
F	they did return it , but why were they retaining my card_details ????
F	they arrived within 0_days
F	my son was so excited_about going to camp beaumont as he had such a great time last_year , but i feel that this experience with these boys has really put him off going again next year .
M	i had been let_down by another delivery company and placed an order with tooled_- up . com .
M	!
M	the product is ok i think the prob is my denture , it is made mostly of metal , so does the glue not suit metal or is there one that does
M	ordered twelve medium_size but recieved sixteen small ones ?
F	waited in all day and of course nothing arrived and phones not answered .
M	its not so bad , when you , think britain , is known as rip_off , capital of europe .
F	i had a voucher for a photo_book so put it to good use making a gift for a family_member who_lives abroad .
F	fast and safe and so helpful staff .
F	did not receive the mattress i ordered .
F	i eventually received the package , the camera itself is fine but with the hassle i went through it is just not worth it .
F	its difficult to check the quality of the flowers when its for a sympathy time .
M	not as cheap as parcels to go , in addition , if you have a have a problem they walk all over you .
F	this one is much simpler and easier for her to use .
M	bra_priser_og rask levering .
F	i have not yet heard from the recipient , s , but don_'_t doubt that the ordered flowers would delight them .
M	i do not know if national fitted the tyres sent to them or used some old tyres from their stock .
F	colour is not a good representation online pictures .
F	luckily my husband was able to repair the damage that had occurred - the metal fitting had been bent in transit .
M	within five_minutes , polly called me back , explained the delay and without_hesitation told me that she ' d refund me my postage - within ten_minutes i received an e_- mail from paypal with the refund for the postage .
F	rubbish rubbish rubbish !
F	i think removal of packaging should be part of the service .
M	great price , great delivery options , can change it by text , and get a notification which hour it will arrive
F	however i had been checking prices over the previous few_days so i do not understand how the booking slipped from the dover / calais booking .
F	but actually receiving my shoes bordered on the farcical .
M	happy to recommend them .
M	well just placed my first order from sw and well we will see how it goes with my order .
M	the courier company never pick_up their phone .
F	could of got better flowers at a petrol_station !
F	if that hadnt of happened with the plastic back i would of been over the moon .
M	ok , my phone was finally unlocked , but takes them several days to do it .
M	it was an international packet to usa .

M	another van was called , a transit .
M	no problem i thought just reorder immediately with it added and cancel the other order .
M	- did not get told that deliveries start at 0am on saturdays and we were first drop of the day !

F	i have never found a place where you could sell your books and dvds you do not use anymore .
F	the final invoice was for £ 0 of calls including_vat and an invented charge for “ unpaid direct_debit ”.
M	i worked out later i could probably have just booked it in online , then and there , for the next_day to register it in their system and they could have not charged me , but this didn_'_t happen .
M	other than that it worked_perfectly .
M	only two reservations - the printed message on the card was slightly wonky which was a let_down as it was a beautiful card , and the bear i ordered was a bit squashed from all the packaging .
F	i open the door to collect my parcel from the jobs worth and he stands and lies to my face .
F	like most i would imagine .
M	bought this wet_suit to kayak and surf in , wanted something for spring , summer and autumn which would not break the bank with better stitching style to keep more water out .

F	also the 0 pairs of leggings i purchased were under a £_00 off offer if you spent over_£_00 , so i '_m assuming i will get charged full price for the leggings i recwived which is wrong !
F	have tried other online drug companies and although some are a little cheaper because they don_'_t charge any postage they aren_'_t anywhere_near as friendly or helpful .
M	got the tyres eventually .

M	took 00_minutes for customer service to answer phone , twice .
M	the next week i received only 0 product .
M	basically the lesson_learned is that they are a bunch of clueless liars who want your money and no_longer care about the customer .

M	last saturday i ordered a spring bouquet for my wife to celebrate_our_anniversary .
F	after 00_minutes and no phone_call from them i got back on to the 0000 number and got through to a gentleman by the name of suheb - it took more than 00_minutes before my call was answered and then i was kept on hold for several more minutes before he came back to me and said he would have to do some more checking .
F	the rugs are poor quality , massively over priced and i would not order any more .

F	product was as_described with the sizing true to what was expected .

M	we are in excess of £_000 out of pocket and , as the phone is now permanently engaged , we can '_t speak to anyone to get our money back .
F	ordered online , received a free set of knife as my purchase is over 00 ( enter code ).

F	i was really happy with the item

M	shocking !!
M	when i contacted evans for an appology they refused to beleive me and said the damage must have been caused while the bike was stood in my house waiting to be rebuilt .
M	would recommend this company .
M	albert vincenti md frcpath
F	on point .
M	they had a great selection of various_types of restaurant , and bar a couple of occasions the food turned_up quickly and correctly .
F	just hope they do arrive in time !
F	i also asked for someone to call me on tuesday ( after easter ) as i was very dissatisfied and was getting no where by ' tickets ' 00th_april_0000 ' ticket ' reply_saying how sorry they were and a call back had been arranged for tuesday 00nd_april_0000 .

M	over the 0 days i '_ve had it running , it has crashed twice .

M	very annoying company but great products and price .
F	wednesday comes .
F	i '_ve had to make other arrangement for parcel .
F	flowers were pretty and good updates with deliveries .
M	if the florist fails , they really need to make a fuss .
F	i bought these flowers for my mum who was delighted and to receive them next_day delivery was great too and very good prices
F	we put it up for her and she is very happy .
M	surely if and items bought on e / bay by customer and have a discount card this should be passed on to that customer most items are paid via pay / pal and can reimburse discounts via pay / pal i know this can be done because i have had postage and even full refunds sent back to me via pay / pal and monies transferred back into to my bank_account .
M	and yes you can bet that was last time i was shoping there , awful customer service , good products .
F	i previously managed to get this locally ( north_east ) but even then it took several weeks to arrive .
M	i ' d already requested a redelivery , which was delivered when requested .
F	good selection but you charge delivery on orders over_£_000 !
F	false_advertising comes to mind especially as all the deals shown did not include the bundle pack .
F	i have used pet_supermarket for a number of years and have noticed they are not as good as they used to be .
F	shame really , used to like virgin at first .
M	so i can '_t i '_m afraid give them a great write up , only an average one this time .
M	i order some flowers early evening and the we on my girlfriends door_step the next_morning .
M	what was happening was that a fine , metallic dust was coming off of the element when in use .
M	just got fined for parking in a perfectly legal area . see you court .
M	the coffee_machine packaging box had ' fragile ' written across the box clearly .
F	i then ordered another futon mattress as the one supplied is quite_thin .

M	the postage could be quicker
M	having_shopped_around the usual websites for new tyres & fitting etc .
M	good value for money too .
M	i ordered a seed and was given a gift of another 0 seeds even confirmed on my email . when my package got here there was only 0 free seed . so but of a let_down !!
M	took time to be informed ( 0 days ) and a lot more ( almost two_weeks ) to be delivered at last …
M	paid for next_day delivery .
M	as a result i went_ahead and placed an order , the first of three to date !
M	review update 00 / 00 /_0000
M	i then ordered on thursday_night with [_external_reference_] who delivered friday_morning - this experience has left me totally mad and disgusted - i am yet to receive a refund too and so have contacted trading_standards - not professional or even worth_bothering with this company at all - to make it worse - the refund came through minus £_00 or so - because i cancelled the order - unbelievable they could neither confirm the despatch date or tell me if they were in fact in stock - they would have been outside their delivery date and they have the neck to charge me for cancelling - terrible _ beware !!
F	therefore i received confirmation that the parcel was signed for & delivered but after many phone_calls to my in laws & [_name_] at uni_baggage - no sign of the parcel .
F	i ordered weaving thread in brown , after paying extra for next_day delivery , the thread i actually received was blonde in colour , which wasn_'_t suitable for the task but as it was an_emergency job i had to use it .

F	wall and tiles have a very good display of tiles sorted_out in colours makes it easy for u to decide what u would like .
M	if they ' d called me the day they received the phone and told me they ' d run out of stock and were waiting for more to come in , i wouldn_'_t have had a problem and would have been happy for them to hang on to the phone until they could repair it to the standard i paid for .
M	my glasses arrived less_than a week_later less_than 00 days in total .
M	there '_s no point in complaining as the compaints team don_'_t bother to ask your opinion and are toothless .
F	we shall see .
F	if you had emailed and told me of the delay i could have allowed for it .
F	the price i paid was the best i could find for the same model elsewhere , and all my internet dealings were instantly backed_up with emails and text_alerts , right down to the hour that delivery would take place .
F	she explained delivery options opted for collection at tescos next_day .
M	being_able to create photobooks using your cewe_software on my pc and thus having the images stored safely under my control is , i find , easier to use and with a better final product than when creating ' in the cloud '.
M	there is no address to write to .
M	i ordered a part listed for my machine wahine after discussing it with a member of staff .
M	i ordered 0 packs at a specially reduced rate , but when they came i found i ' d been charged the full rate .
M	so i don_'_t know how skiddle compares with other similar services on this front , but paying £ 0 . 00 for a £_00 ticket leaves a taste in my mouth akin to a 0 - day old grilled stoat .
M	the person on the telephone should have advised i needed them
M	but it didnt shows up any money in my account .
F	i wish i had never_heard of them .
M	0 new tyres_fitted in no time , brilliant and courteous service .

M	can '_t find the car_rental desks .
M	fab !
F	i must_say that customer_services were really helpful and friendly and i would use the company again .
M	i personally find the site a nightmare to navigate .
F	0 : censorship for political reasons , regardless of who '_s opinion it is , is never in the best interest of the people .
F	they offer good value , well_designed products but sometimes their buyers lose the way with their choices !
M	other orders i have placed also arrived around 0 minutes after making payment at the checkout .
F	both my recent_purchase of two_pairs of glasses arrived promptly and are both perfect .

M	this may seem a trivial matter but this item was a gift for someones birthday and i didn_'_t get it in time .
M	two items of the order were not delivered to the requested room .
M	apart_from that no other gripes !
M	great price , great availability but awful service .

F	everything you could want for a fancy_dress_party for all ages plus fast delivery , will use this site in the future
M	when i rang glasses_direct the first time , there was no mention of vari - focal_lenses .
M	always did what they said they would do .
F	would use service again .
F	i don_'_t know how they have the cheek to firstly charge double for the actual ticket price on top of a booking_fee and n enormous delivery charge .
F	it wouldn_'_t be fair for me to leave a negative_review .
F	i will not be using this company again .
M	good speedy service at reasonable prices , keep it up .

M	fast delivery
F	( the lady at check in in dover had said it was full ).
F	i ordered a tub of replacement powder that my dog urgently_needed and i was impressed by the speed of delivery .
M	if you take out the delivery , they ' re easily a 0_star company .
M	person rude and site misleading
M	all in all the quality was terrible .
M	definitely reccomend !
M	i was told i then had to ring back in the morning if i wanted a refund .
M	i have been a loyal_customer , i am remembered when it comes to email sales shots but time each time i order , never am i remembered .
M	they were delivered saturday i arrived home from work abroad today and asked where the flowers were the sorry looking bunch pointed_out to me were neither red nor grandisimo .
M	wow , i '_m well impressed with both the efficiency and pricing of the shower_doctor .
F	my daughter found this on line and ordered it for me .
F	also very polite .
M	so if i hadn_'_t queried this and thought , oh they '_ll take the payment and obviously that wouldn_'_t actually happen , i ' d get charged for failing to pay - and they ' d blame me for thinking their website was accurate with them being a financial institution .
F	i would definitely recommend .
F	all done without_any fuss on my own driveway .
F	the item was not the freesia bunch which i had ordered it was important as my mother for whom they were sent to has failing sight and the fragrance is why i chose them .
F	i went in to the store and went through their security_check to be told that i failed it again .
F	excellent service .
F	brilliant service thanks - shame i have no more old ones !
M	ordered replacement batteries for three specialist watches .
M	delivery was fast a + for that .
F	we arrived having received an e_mail giving us codes to enter the gate to obtain keys .
M	i was really impressed by the service and communications however unfortunately the product didn_'_t meet my expectations .
M	i hope some one at_least read at respond to me for the first time !
M	updated - they have now replied and refunded the difference so i '_ve changed my star_rating .
M	my concern is when i contacted them to check if was safe to use was advised " should be " and at " my own_risk ", i contacted several reputable supplements stockists and was advised that products can be consumed past expiry as they are given a shorter shelf_life than actually good for , however after 0 . 0 years that date would have long past , potential risk now outweighs benefit and strongly advised against consuming !!
M	i had a great customer experience when buying my wet_suit and was very happy with it when it arrived .
F	he then said item out of stock and it was an_error .
M	if i had been asked to rate them immediately after delivery it would probably have five_stars .
M	both said dispatched emails one arrived promptly the other i waited the 0 days and then mailed .
M	recommend this company to anybody
F	trying washing up liquid , silicone grease , or soaking the seal in warm water made no difference .
M	on the one hand , they have all the bike parts i '_ll ever need and the staff are always helpful and willing to part with a little advice on bike maintenance .
M	uk and us web sites are different with different rates .
M	yet , what they claimed ( and was true ) was that the price that other_sites / companies offer with free shipping or lower shipping_costs was lower_than the $_00 shipping + price of the products on their site .
M	it then it took 0 days for the refund to arrive .
M	i '_ve arranged for a letter and gift_voucher to be sent to you which will go out within a working week .
F	he repeatedly changed his story saying he had , then he didnt know , and he didnt even get a signature so we have no idea who ended_up with the gift .
M	each time has_been an_emergency of sorts , such as a missed birthday or late purchase of a card .
F	awful pushy and not prepared to do anything about my complaint the sooner this company goes out of business the better !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
M	if it doesn_'_t work the first time . its not going to work the 0th or 0th .
F	the whole time i received regular_emails to keep me updated on the whole_process .
F	would definitely recommend .
M	good company , dropped the phone off to there office rather_than posting .
F	we all had non - delivery of our flowers !!!!!
F	very happy customer .
F	he finally found something at over 000_quid , i told him i was not happy , as i had started at 000_quid , he offered 000_quid , now , after 00_minutes , i '_m at over 000_quid .
M	00p a minute to land lines in the uk shocking
M	would recomend to anyone looking for quality at a good price .
M	if they don_'_t , someone is going to get upset .
M	trying to get hold of the person dealing_with my order was very difficult and no - one else seemed willing or able to help .
F	delivery was fine .
F	this was not a cheap order (£_000 ) to summarise :
F	i only have two complaints .
F	worst product i have ever had from icelands i wont purchase from there ever again . for another pound could have got a really tasty pizza from morrisons , cheap isant always cheap . is it
M	this could have been a one off so would probably give the benefit of doubt .
M	machine runs beautifully , lots of accessories and cotton to get going with .
M	put it on a credit_card as you have more rights if there are problems .
F	the item arrived at 0pm thursday_afternoon only 0_days late !!
M	excellent sales and communication .
M	from order to delivery time was just a couple of days .
M	the biggest problem is that sagepay use elavon .
M	opted for free del but product del next_day .
M	due to be fitted on saturday , not convenient for me but i need the tyres .
M	all my prints are coming out half faded and very bad quality , which are unreadable and it has_been waste of money as the cartridge is useless for me !
F	would recommend and use again .
M	i would much rather have taken the vehicle full and returned the car full of fuel ( as most uk car_rentals operate ) having sourced my own replacement fuel at the lower costs .
M	i '_ve done this and they can '_t see any credits pending which i '_ve told betfair and they say it '_s not their problem as they '_ve processed the withdrawal .
F	i would recommend essential_travel_insurance for a holiday because it was very inexpensive and provided a very good level of cover .
F	i was told it would be with me on friday and i would receive an_email thursday_night with my delivery details .
M	someone please tell me what it means when i pay certain_amount of money every_month to protect my phone against being stolen ?
F	plenty of information , easy to order .
F	it was good to receive a phone_call from a very
F	thank_you .
M	before we were quit happy to book , but now no response , no service if you have a problem a the agency you rented the car .
F	i was very impressed with order confirmation tracking texts & then confirmation of delivery .
M	overall we paid a load of money because they weren_'_t very specific about the size of the furniture for the first delivery , and then wouldn_'_t take_responsibility for their own advice in the second .
M	do your_homework here and it depends entirely on what roads you '_ll be using the most .
F	i would advise anyone against using this company , as they are only interested in the sale , absolutely no regard for their customers , or take any responsiblity in the event of a problem .
F	i cannot recommend this company highly_enough .
M	the other channels just don_'_t float the boat , 000 channels and nothing on .
M	they also told me that they would get a replacement sourced and sent out to me .
F	unfortunately , when it arrived it was packaged so snugly within the plastic_covering that when we opened the suit , some of the imprinted pattern was stuck to itself and some of the the colour peeled_off and ran into other colours , spoiling the overall look of the outfit .
F	i get a sense that these individuals are very god at the sales_pitch and making money off people at the start but less good at after - care and facing up to responsibilities when things go_wrong .
M	no surprise .
F	i can not comment on the because is not delivered yet .
F	i needed a lot curling ribbon and parytrama had exactly the colours i wanted at the right price too . the photos on the web_site displayed the colours accurately and my order was quickly dispatched .
M	my car looked as though it had been driven round a field in a rally .
M	i felt_confident buying insurance from true_traveller .
M	it is amazing in our room , completely changed the look , really comfy and the whole family can sit together - a perfect home_cinema .
F	after nothing improved by end of second week i said i wanted to ' escalate my complaint '.
F	as of today however , i have just been rudely_told by a ' senior_manager ' to keep the dress and put an end to the matter due to asos arranging couriers that cannot keep to agreed time frames to pick_up a collection .
M	somebody . or the boss at ladbrokes . is a wealthy person , i never met a winner . ever
M	after 00 days from order i still have no my items , delivery failed , my money are lost
F	i am extremely disappointed in the service i received .
M	all went well until delivery arrived .
M	all the stores are generally entertaining and fun with a wide_range of media and gadgets .
F	but the carrier they use , yodel , is not so good .
F	this was not the case , and so the website listing was inaccurate and not up to date .
M	i received an offer of another free trial which i did not take up and despite this usenext confirmed i needed to take no further_action .
F	she '_s delighted , so i '_m happy !!!!
F	nobody ever answers the phone , despite_repeated emails & phone messages over weeks they have failed to respond to my request for a refund .
F	postage and service were good but offer of packaging - gift box or wrapping offer - did not present itself until after order was done .
F	i argued the point and stated the distant selling laws , but was met with , thats it take it or leave it .
M	they make promises they can '_t keep .
F	would never use again and will not be recommending to anyone .
M	bought 0 products with next_day delivery , both were faulty .
F	i had to phone to be told that part of my order actually wasn_'_t in stock and they '_d send it all when it arrived - they could send in two parts but would charge me extra postage .
M	i was absolutely shocked to then be told i had to pay £_00 . 00 for the single return_journey , which is some £_00 . 00 more than the whole return fare cost in the 0st place , not exactly the best way of treating a retuning customer , i . e ., repeat_business .
M	prompt delivery without_any problem nothing else to say
M	the " track my order " page still lists my order as not having shipped and i have no tracking_number to verify that it is on its way .
M	i pointed_out how foolish it would be to cut it so fine given that things obviously had already gone_wrong once .
M	the tyres were also marked with white oil - based paint and needed cleaning with white_spirit .
M	found what i wanted quickly and size_guide was easy to read .
F	on arrival the villa was not clean .
M	come on virgin .
M	uiteindelijk kreeg ik later op_de dag een mailtje terug dat mijn aanbetaling alsnog was verwerkt .
F	0_days passed and nothing arrived .
M	up until recent years apple we the no . 0 company for fast reliable computers .
M	i have always found the service , choice and delivery to be of the highest_standards possible .
M	everything was so simple to get what you need and it was delivered when i was told it would be
M	unfortunately the ticket never came and i got a link for the eticket .
F	would recomend to all our friends .
M	orders always received promptly & a great price !
F	recently i ordered some items from bondra , i have ordered items in the past and had no_issues .
F	i would definitely use iflorist again to deliver gifts and flowers to my friends and family in england .
F	the cleaners only cleaned once in the whole fortnight - didn_'_t even clean outside then .
F	i have ordered a few_times and always received and excellent service .
F	i am not impressed with this season '_s clothes which veer from dated and boring to quirky and overpriced .
F	given i was effectively buying blind online ( ie , not seen the costume in person nor given the opportunity to try different_sizes ) it would have been great to see some more images of the costumes than just the regular run of the mill marketing picture on the costume package .
M	i hope it is not usual .
M	cheapest for oakley glasses .
M	" customer service deal with this issue , but we can '_t transfer you to them " " sit tight , someone will contact you " still no call , 0 days on .
M	from_start to finish , using mazumamobile to gain some extra cash for a mobile that was sat around the house gathering_dust was hassle_free .
M	i contacted customer_care and got an extremely lukewarm response .
F	glasses finally arrived this morning and as i picked them up from the case , a lens fell out !
M	however , this date will break my current bt contract .
M	compared prices with other trade in sites and zapper came out well , although not always the best .
M	can '_t ask for anything more than that .
F	not everything was built it that i had asked for and was on my order summary .
M	world_stores , even you could not make this any worse if you tried !!
M	order arrived 0st october !!
F	i saw the flowers 0_days after delivery .
F	she then collided with another bus ( whilst shouting and gesticulating at some pedestrians who happened to step off the pavement ) and then blamed the other driver .
M	so adding up : 000_euro for the car , 00 euro insurance at rentalcars . com , plus 00 euro insurance at hertz !!!
M	regards alan hinman .
M	prices are very competitive , and free_postage on larger orders makes pharmacy0u a most attractive proposition .
F	how come when all staff doing same thing and management being told by employees of this .
F	she also went through the various different finance packages they could offer , including an interest free option , which is the one i chose but there were so many different options that were all really affordable , which surprised me , i should have looked in to it sooner , instead of assuming i couldn_'_t afford it .
M	the website advertises dispatch same day , delivery next_day . you have the option of paying by credit_card or paypal .
M	i will_certainly use them again .
M	however , after struggling to pay via the internet and having to change browsers to make payment work i then chose a ' heart ' card with message .
F	i ordered a number of appliances for my new_kitchen earlier in the year and had no less_than 00 phone_calls , emails , text_messages etc .
F	unfortunately the ballon i ordered to say i love you had been replaced with a totally_inappropriate happy birthday_balloon .
M	my only complaint is that i paid extra for the cards to be delivered the next_day .
M	goods are in perfect_condition .
F	morning of delivery called to say what time of arrival .
M	admittedly it would be quicker on an online auction_site but i wanted to save the hassle of putting up and having attached risks with sending it off to potential scammers .
F	but i had to go on a journey before then .
F	ordered a new bank card as mine snapped recieved it 0_days_later in the post was awaiting a new pin to come which never did after ringing them i found out i wouldn_'_t recieve a new one .
M	i would recomend to anyone if asked .
F	but i am not asking them for a refund but to claim on the insurance they sold me !!
M	so based on the delivery promise should have arrived before new year but arrived on 0rd_jan .
M	so got half back for the phone then what i was expecting .
M	thank_you !
F	i recieved the tens 0_days_later .
F	no need to make appointments .
F	you should send an_email_confirmation that the parcel has_been collected .
M	therefore i wrote to them demanding , under the rules pertaining to the data_protection act , what information they had on file as is my right .
F	i think they should put on your account redeemed when been redeemed , then mistakes won_'_t be made
F	well still no furniture .
M	crap useless customer_services take your money no goods turn_up because they use a crap company like royal_mail who always loses your parcel somehow , why use them i will never know , then you have to wait weeks before you can get a refund or sent a reorder absolutely a joke .
M	deliveries come fast , returns and refunds are handled without_fuss .
F	had booked to catch 00 . 00 overnight bus from budapest to berlin on 0 / 0 /_0000 .
M	!
M	oh , and the cost of the whole_thing was about a third of what you ' d pay for a new canon_printer_cartridge .
F	some of the brands they sell are of the higher end but i would say there is also a lot of cheaper rubbish with plenty of marketing spiel .
M	i was very happy with how quickly the flowers were delivered but i wash it didn_'_t cost to much .
F	!
F	i have used the company for three windows now and i '_m delight with all of them .
F	quick and easy thanks
F	i will not be using this company again .
F	will definitely buy from here again
F	sent some things off and got a credit_note email quickly .
F	i would have spent a lot more with this company as i am_currently upgrading all my computers , but their failure to accept their responsibility just means i went elsewhere .
F	my boiler has a reset button which i pressed and i also tried turning boiler off and on but did not work .
M	this tower was fortunately of lowish value but was packaged exactly the same as it was when dhl delivered it to me a year previous and clearly_shows from the box what is inside .
F	the web - site was easy to navigate , ( so no blue cloud over my keyboard ) and my order arrived very promptly .
M	great site , good prices , free batteries lol . no_nonsense
F	lovely styles were available in a wide_range of sizes , so choosing was easy .
M	by far the worst organization i have dealt_with .
M	prompt despatch and delivery .
F	i contacted the help_desk and they were very helpful and apologetic and promised to send the missing items out asap - a delivery duly_arrived on the tuesday however the frame part was not on the delivery , the wrong amount of springs had been sent and they were a different size from the ones which came with the original delivery !!
M	i haven ’_t seen a refund over 0_weeks_later and strangely when i paid it was out of my account the same day ?
M	will give them another opportunity in the future .
F	first and last order placed with this company and would definately not use again . will stick with amazon in future and pay the same price to get it delivered next_day !
M	next time il do it a week earlier and i won_'_t be quite as frantic .
M	the number_plate i pre_- ordered and paid for was also not ready on collection and i had to wait for this to be done .
M	now we wanna know what you think so we can keep making shopping with us even more brilliant .
M	not very impressed as we ' d done everything we could to check before hand .
F	however , paying the minimum repayment each_month , i have paid £ 0000 in interest and now owe more than i took out at £ 0000 .
F	apparently there was no record of my booking whatsoever !
M	regards ,
F	very pleased would def use again
F	really ?
M	:)
M	the flowers were decent but not very many for the price and didnt look like the image at all .
F	i tried pet_supermarket for the cats ' supplies last_week for the first time .
F	i then got an_email to say i had only 0_days left to redeem .
M	key_retirement solutions gave_me two supportive , comprehensive and fully informative free consultations and answered most of my worries and concerns .
F	now serenata say they don_'_t have any phone contact but deal will deal with problems by email , within an_hour .
M	price is ok , but customer service is slow and near non - existant
F	driver waiting on us , excellent service would recommend .
F	sales was ok but he didn_'_t like the fact that i knew_exactly_what i didn_'_t want - furnature polish etc .
F	she couldn_'_t help but said she would put a fast track on our email to try sort it out .
F	they offer better rates than many others and process and post the cheque quickly .
M	products competitively_priced and delivered swiftly .
M	they have mastered the art of selling crap food in brighlty packaged wrappers endorsed by the latest movie with plastic toys as a gift and streamlined your lunch order to do you want fries with that or do you want to go large ( what round the waste ) no thanks !!
M	my fault entirely so guess the motto is try before you buy .
M	however , i believe that as a newcomer to the game there are some differences that separate me from those who have been in this arena for a long time .
F	:-( i do accept some responsibility for not double_checking the size , but i also feel quite a lot of girls use this service and would trust the registration option .
F	both lads were very helpful but in particular oliver , who talked_me through step by step .
M	will never ever use again !
M	so as i needed these parts in a timely_fashion i was forced to cancel the coolers as they would not send the rest of the order .
M	i was told to " do it yourself ".
F	my husband thinks that they are ok .
M	this is my first experience with quietpc and it has a been a very satisfactory one based on their delivery speed and the condition my order arrived in .
F	really good service on availability and delivery . prices beat a well_known high_street retailer hands_down . wouldnt go_anywhere_else for my vitamins .
F	i felt let_down .
F	no parcel tuesday so made contact only to be advised it couldnt be tracked to see where it was as wasnt scanned which wasnt the girls fault she tried to get the information .
M	recommended seller .
F	very .
F	arrived on time and well_packaged .
M	after asking for the money to be brought back i was told ' we are too_busy '.
F	it would have been nice if the company had actually contacted me and made me aware of the delay at_least once throughout the three_weeks , instead of me having to call them numerous_times .
M	the price for my product was significantly_lower_than in steam and within a minute of the order being placed i was installing my latest purchase .
F	easy site to use and excellent value
F	we oredered a years supply of fybogel lemon an were disappointed that it didn_'_t taste like the highstreet pharmacy lemon , but more like lemon / clementines , which isn_'_t the greatest of tastes .
M	today , tuesday i called again . promised for tomorrow .
F	shame about delivery , ok so i didn_'_t pay as i opted for the free service , but if i knew it would have taken over a week to receive the parcel i would have defiantly paid for postage .
F	i was able to contact mr thornhill very quickly - head_office was very efficient - and he took great pains to explain things to me again .
F	i '_m sorry to say that my products still have not arrived 0_weeks after order and paying for 0 - 0 working day delivery .
M	do not believe a word this company says .
F	when i spoke to [_name_] on the phone , she wasn_'_t apologetic at all - just a bit stroppy .
F	collected the next_day - air_con wasn_'_t working !!
F	like other customers i too have had a mixed experience with very .
M	always helpful and good selection but no call back after price match enquiry which forced me to contact them again .
M	documentation in the envelope .
F	staff very friendly and deal with enquiries fast and efficient , will not_hesitate to recommend .
F	excellent value and delivered really quickly .
F	customer service is fast and pleasantly polite & helpful but i cannot_afford to purchase too much at one time being inhibited by income .
M	and to give you some figures the premiums now are around £ 00000 per year for myself , my wife and one daughter .
M	was please with the goods and speedy service
F	the courier company left a card to say that they had tried to deliver , however if you don_'_t e_mail them before 0pm that same day then you can '_t have your delivery the following_day !
M	i think the surface is easily damaged .
F	freezes constantly .
M	i bought a product ( car insurance ) in good faith and the money ( around £_00 ) the vendor i was expecting never arrived .
F	would recommend .
M	city_link recently lost a consignment of ours worth over £ 0000 and when we claimed for our losses they quoted their t '_s &_c '_s and paid us a paltry_£_000 in compensation .
F	after buying made to measure_blinds from another company i decided to give blinds 0 go a try and am very pleased with the service , quality and fit for the price .
M	the item is of excellent quality , very solid and a joy to look at .
F	two_weeks_later the product had gone up to £_000 !
F	neutral .
M	the delivery time was longer_than the stated 0 - 0 working_days > i contacted 000golf by telephone on the 00th day , the phone was picked_up and hung_up straight_away on 0 occaissions .
F	flowers were late , then delivered to the wrong house .
M	ok website but can be difficult to find information at times .
F	they have said they tried to deliver today and left a card when my partner was there all day and at the time they say they did this currys were actually delivering a freezer so clearly lying .
F	i have no_hesitation in recommending your company to anyone at anytime in the future .
F	yes . very good service . price better and love the free service . you will definitely be getting my buisness in the future .
M	friendly staff , easy to navigate web_site and i took_advantage of 00 months 0 % interest !
M	excellent comms excellent product , first_class service .
M	ordered a product it did not arrive so i e_- mailed to say so , received a automatic reply confirming_receipt of e_- mail , but still no explanation as to why non - delivery . they say they will reply within_00hrs . it is now 0days and still not heard_anything
F	i will not order again i am afraid .
F	really disappointed with this and embarrassed by them .
F	i knew the clarks boots i wanted , i already had a shop bought pair , but wanted a different colour so ordered them online .
M	i got a good discount compared to rrp , it arrived quickly and was well_packaged .
F	same day didn_'_t happen and the surprise was ruined .
F	easy service to use and cheaper_than the post_office for larger items
F	good service but an overload of emails .
M	website very easy to use .
F	was very good .
M	just cos you like to share everything doesnt mean that we do .
F	two_days after it was apparently due at their warehouse i was then told their suppliers couldn_'_t supply it and couldn_'_t say when it would be in stock .
F	the refills have also gone down_hill .
F	i have also paid over_£_000 in flights to get to the event but viagogo have washed their hands of this saying it is the organisers problem .
F	it is so much_easier and quicker_than doing a repeat_prescription via the doctor '_s office .
M	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 you can raise the issue with the yodel direct online web chat team and they will be able to book the collection in for you as well .
F	an excellent system - easy to get quote and book online .
F	mr john thornhill came to see me from key_retirement_solutions .
M	i therefore contacted pet_supermarket by email in the 0nd week of january .
M	or go to all the trouble of sending it all back and starting again .
F	found the website easy , and ordering easy .
F	i had to wait another week before finally receiving my item .
F	i have ordered bags before and had no_issues but recently ordered small paper_bags for a specific purpose .
M	the delivery was fast , the items good quality , and website / transaction smooth and simple !
F	the service is really quick and sales advisors are very responsive .
F	a webchat then revealed that they had dispatched the glasses ( no notification to me ) and they tried to say that it was my fault for not being in to receive a delivery - no card from the couriers , no delivery attempted !
M	give it a little try out it was great nice bit of gear for the price .
F	is always short_staffed .
F	attempts to contact via_facebook received sarcastic unhelpful response .
M	overall villa_plus were pretty good with very good staff .
F	i was told the fabric would be delivered and the incorrect one collected .
M	easy online ordering and a good choice of racks and other products .
M	we just bought some curtains for home delivery .
M	the fountain could be bought elsewhere .
F	really , glad to leave this feedback . will recommend to all friends and family .
M	then said he needs to call track and trace . who did i speak to before . they shouldn_'_t have told me to wait . will call back later today .
M	!
M	great product at the cheapest price anywhere on the net .
F	payment will not arrive until the 0nd may either .
F	the food on the plane was aweful & the tv_channels appeared to be on some sort of loop whereby you had to wait for all the other channels to end before they could be started over again .
F	no apparantly they left on porch ???
M	i placed my first order , and received free protein , and a free_shaker .
F	great service
M	contacted wiggle regarding returning item for correct i . e .
M	fast service .
M	easy to use and would use again .
F	i also like normally a cooked_breakfast ( a healthy one ) and to be honest at0am i don_'_t fancy porridge or shake but i did take to work the treacle and pecan muesli and had it with plain yogurt at 00 ish which was nice .
M	nice massage .
M	service was good and your engineer ( lee0 was very good .
F	the tiles seem good although we have not been able to put them up yet , and they were comparatively well priced .
F	i got mildly suspicious about the speed of delivery of the second ( free order ), this time arriving the very next_day of the purchase , despite the customer_care team told me they didn_'_t have one of the product on the stock , and therefor i would have to wait 0 additional days .
F	as this was such a special_occasion we had to buy a bunch from asda which cost half the price and looked a lot nicer .
F	i used to be a great fan of ri , but this company is turned into one of my most hated and i refuse to give them any more of my money !!
M	slow delivery plus something not arriving at all from an amazon connected supplier .
M	may 0th : i '_ve emailed them asking if there is any news on the item i ordered in march ( two_days delivery )!
M	good products from extensive selection .
F	they offer lots of information on the site to assist in making informed selections and always offer very prompt delivery .
F	think it must be the magnesium and iron .
F	i received the sample invitations as ordered and was happy with the quality , however wheni tried to order them on - line , a fault when putting the items in my shopping_basket made my internet browser close .
M	would definitely recommend
F	best price on the net for the item i bought .
M	should sort_out there voucher situation !
M	to add injury to insult , they also tried to charge us an extra £_00 .
F	the occasion has passed and the surprise has_been spoiled for a dear_friend .
M	unfortunately because it was such a good seller , topps said it would be unlikely that they would discount them .
F	i had ordered 00x small white bags and 00x large white bags , the small bags were perfect but the large white bags had been sent with a white body and cream handles .
F	a great customer service experience overall and i love my vulpine merino_wool jersey !
F	i hope my next experience is not quite so tortuous and prolonged .
F	some get it , some dont get it - but those who sign up and take 0 minutes to browse the website have thanked_me .
M	it '_s called speaking and expressing oneself .
F	would have been better to learn this earlier and take the option of a sooner dispatch minus the item .
F	the quality is excellent .
M	any company that relies on these joker to deliver should be avoided .
F	i would be happy to recommend them to anyone .
F	i called and they checked on the status of my order .
F	can '_t fault efficiency , fitter polite and kept me informed of when he was arriving .
F	excellent , friendly service .
F	called this morning to be told ' we can only apologise but we can_assure you that the delivery will happen this afternoon '.
F	i ordered a desk which av0home kindly price matched .
M	we sent a camera and three mobile_phones .
M	i wanted to complain and take a legal_action but next_day had to go on a long holiday .
F	very good company to deal with and who match prices with any other company .
F	brilliant service matches my new diamonds
M	great website , able to compare lots of gear .
F	pants !! pants !
M	cowboys .
F	good but could of been better
M	my gran ( age 00 ) lives in a multi - storey block of flats .
F	lovely worktop , good value and delivered in good time .
F	i had checked this with them and knew that no fee was due .
F	flowers were well_presented and i am happy with the flowers , but as nice as they if i am honest i am unlikely to use the eflorist again as my usual online florists are a lot_cheaper and include free delivery
M	i '_ve recommended a few people now .
M	at_least on other platforms they tell you the fees upfront .
M	absolutely excellent service , fast and everything else
F	this subsequently made me late for work as i was going straight to work from the airport .
F	i have been told that you are not able to supply this for me .
F	the flowers weren_'_t as expected or as nicely_presented as on the website but for the price paid was just acceptable .
F	unfortunately i also got a virus on my computer after visiting the site and we had to get tech_support in to clear it .
M	i would thoroughly_recommend uni_baggage to anyone trying to get student belongings back home .
F	i was able to have a personal consultation over the phone to help me choose the right model and firmness .
M	they were very helpful and corrected my error with a call to my mobile .
M	ebookers switched it to a flight with one change , without compensation .
M	i think if i had known this service earlier , i would have saved a lot of time and money .
F	cheap_smells is second to none in supplying perfumes fast , efficiently and most of all cheaper_than any other outlet i have yet to discover .
F	the envelope turned_up the next_day , i posted my phone back and had been paid within 0_days .
F	even allowing for the xmas holidays - this would appear to have taken much longet to deliver than we would jave expected .
F	its now jan 00th and i still have no refund !
F	excellent service from_start to finish
F	i could only return them and then order something new .
M	however , i cannot_fault their wonderful customer service and i was fully refunded within 0 days .
F	judging the food on this river_cruise in comparison to the large cruise_ship food may not be fair , hence my assessment of acceptable british food but not very good .
M	this company is a scam and there are plently of highly_rated companies that you can buy from instead . good luck .
F	quite a long time from the mement i oredered and received my parcel .
M	i would purchase more batteries if i could be assured of better packaging .
M	okay service , not the quickest and marks on the screws and white powder around the lenses that took some getting off .
M	i tried various links , and calls to moonpig , to no_avail .
F	when i phoned torrs they told me they was not delivering the treadmill that day because they had been told by sport leisure to contact me that day to arrive a suitable day to deliver that week .
M	?
M	overall i '_m very happy and would recommend the service to anyone .
F	total_waste of time .
M	may not use them again
F	update_:
F	- not only were these items unavailable but i hadn_'_t had any notification of the situation .
F	didn_'_t realise buying a bed could be so much fun .
M	other carriers will give a two hour delivery window which should be possible with a little planning .
F	i am sure with lots of tlc she will grow_into a fine specimen
M	the fact i decided to take it afterwards was matter of feelings for you , but wouldnt do it again .
F	so . all in all will have to get a few more pairs !
F	deluxe was 00 roses with the same 0 freesia .
F	checkout_process was easy and delivery was very fast !
F	says it all really
M	the replacement wasnt finished properly
M	the shop sent a courier which i though was good and i was happy with that .
M	although there are frequent times where it will disconnect when you ' re in the middle of something it doesn_'_t happen every time and some locations are better_than others .
F	excellent .
F	a great way of finding the perfect hotel for you .
F	turned_up in a brown box , no nice packaging there were hardly no flowers , i could of gone to any high_street shop or supermarket and got more for less_than a fiver . i am a idiot for using you services .
M	i needed to change my booking - that was done pretty quickly and efficiently and did not cost too much extra so that was good .
M	all three are quite satisfactory , for the price .
M	poor service in my opinion .
M	the customer service team have been a huge help in advising my purchases with their very extensive product knowledge .
F	i rang drinkstuff to explain and was thrilled to be able to quickly speak to a caring human_being who quickly arranged for a replacement to be sent with minimal_fuss .
F	wish i '_d bought one sooner .
M	i would recommend this company to anybody
M	easy to order and my stuff turned_up within a couple of days .
F	i phoned ebookers and spent half an_hour on the phone .
M	said no as this is an expensive piece of kit and i need to be able to rely_on it .
M	the availability of customer ratings and comments is very useful and i always use them to make my choices .
M	i wrote a review sharing my concerns .
M	apple_iphone mobile ( facebook ) keeps_crashing , when your paying all that money you want more than just a die hard sequel that like the films gets higher & higher , but the bottom_line is they all do the same thing , break easy , battery_life cant cope with lots going on , so is it really a mobile when your always plugged in the mains or waiting for it to be repaired ( have a spare back up phone to be safe )
M	i had a set of wire wheels , to be fitted with inner_tubes and white wall edges for tyres , manager fitted them letting staff watch and learn !!!
F	i got to know this website through amazon and was very fascinated about the website in that you can virtually get all you need to decorate your venue and even also the color themes gives one great ideas in decorating . prices do vary from item to item which in some cases are competitive but generally a good place to shop .
F	not good service .
M	you stated small cosmetic_damage was acceptable first , but then offered less stating cosmetic_damage .
F	would definitely recommend and also use again myself !
M	two hours came and went and was then told we should contact the delivery company direct ourselves .
M	ordered up led_light sets , which were delivered in two_days from order .
F	still no delivery date .
M	- fast
M	welldone perfume shop as i won_'_t be using your site again may be it about time you pick_up phone and speak with your customer than relying too much on your systems !
M	.
M	my last brand gold standard is still the best out there but the price you pay for it is ridiculous and at the end of the day its just protein_powder !
M	easy to deal with and good prices .
F	pre orded ps0 console in plenty of time to get on release day as surprise gift for husband .
M	will use again for price , ease of ordering , good website full of info , and good customer service , thanks
F	i shall be very interested to see just how long it takes for me to get my money back !
M	they are sent , to be signed for , with a minimum cost of £ 0 . 00 .
M	moreover , they did not noticed me about the service charge when i was about to checkout for the ticket on their website !!!!!!!
F	as above .
M	i have used this company for a number of items and have found them all to be great quality well priced and very fast deliveries i would recomend them .
F	no room for error and no customer service - completely unsympathetic to what was a genuine mistake that could easily have been rectified given the fact that i had realised and informed eflorist immediately .
M	once my contract_ends i will leave them and never return .
M	i received only one response to my request and that was more_expensive than buying the part new .
F	i '_ve always shopped round and found precious_little one to come out on top with cheaper retail prices than other_retailers .
F	he said ( and this is classic ) ' we only book them the day before !'
M	but i didn_'_t even get the link to the terms and conditions ( which is hidden away at the bottom of the welcome email ) until after i had paid over the phone for the service .
M	it wasn_'_t until i emailed to express my concerns that i found out that my item wasn_'_t going to be coming for such a long time .
F	easy to upload prescription
M	my brother loved the jacket and i loved the price .
F	they are helpful , fast and the communication is also perfect .
F	i '_d recommend them and use them again .
M	ordered from ireland and the order was dispached the same day and arrived 0 days_later .
M	if a high_street shop took your money and didnt give you what you wanted and said " well you can '_t speak to anyone ".
M	they promised to make a full_refund - see below :
F	the product was exactly_what we wanted , only the next_day delivery did not happen , ordered on a friday , got it on tuesday , ripped_off
M	they ' re not even cheaper !
M	i found some different pictures of one of the models online .
F	i work long hours as a head teacher and would prefer the snacks with a touch of hummus or something like that .
M	a range of delivery options to suit all_budgets and timescales too .
M	each time i ordered the batteries arrived by post the following_day .
M	i have always appreciated national_tyre .
F	my first prescription was dealt_with quickly and efficiently .
M	got free 00hr delivery .
F	i tried to contact the company over the weekend using the phone , the ticket raising section and the online help but to no_avail .
M	i run regular speed tests on a bunch of services .
M	just booked a new holiday for a group of 00 of us and jet0 didn_'_t get a thought .
M	the technical_information on their website is outstanding and up - to - date .
F	i would not recommend oak_furniture_land after the very poor customer service .
F	it '_s a good job that i have a good vet who was able to do a new script for me that day .
M	about half an_hour later i received another call from this company ( a different person ); a similar conversation ensued .
M	his products are excellent and the quality is perfect .
M	they use yodel for delivery .
M	i was very happy with the service provided .
F	however , had my credit_card not been a problem i would have been quite impressed .
M	but when we came to alicante to pickup the car , we were presented for another payment on 0 . 000 danish kroner .
F	all in all v stressful and i can_honestly_say the worst service we have ever had in turkey ; shame on you resorthoppa .
F	our order was despatched and delivered very quickly and packaged well .
M	but eventually got the glasses very late
F	clearly if the description was not confusing and misleading , and there was no room to misinterpret it they would have left it as is !
F	it was eventually the 00th_nov when they replied to me asking me to send them the photos i had took as evidence when it arrived so that they can confirm the fault , begin an investigation and go_ahead with arranging for another to be sent out to you right away .
F	thank_you mazuma
F	and no reply to our emails .
F	i like the added peace of mind for an extra_charge of tracking and insurance .
M	telephoned mattress world , who were less_than helpful .
F	very disappointed and not value for money in our opinion
F	!
F	i gave home address for delivery i called in the morning to check on delivery as not confident i would receive it , they had home address with postcode and work postcode , they were trying to deliver to work again .
F	this is an awful experience with vague comments which could mean anything .
M	could not use my mobile_phone in holland , caused quite a few problems
F	this is my first sewing_machine as i have only just taken up the hobby of sewing .
M	my visits to wilkinson are a fraction of what they used to be .
F	i was told on ordering it would not be in stock unitl the beginning of january so i knew we would not get it for christmas but the 0th of feb was a bit too long !
M	i would definitely use comfy living again .
M	when we asked about the tie , it ended in an argument with an unhelpful salesperson !

F	we complained about serving food on cold plates .

M	but they messed_up the card when they printed " sender requires no message "
F	had to make rush shopping trip saturday_morning to buy gloves .
M	just like the curate '_s egg , this experience was partly good and partly not so good .
M	what great service !!!
M	anyway , it turned_out not to be which only became_apparent when i got an update to my order on the day i was expecting to receive it !
F	i was very disappointed
M	the southampton office was efficient , the staff pleasant and helpful .
M	fitted today so probably ok .
M	proper vw guys thanks kenny beaton .
F	first the money for two things went out but was refunded then the one product that did go through was not ordered .
F	dinkybox also has a nice collection of japanese figures ( such as pinky street and revoltech ), as well as books and manga supplies .
M	ring your bank and ask about the chargeback procedure , it '_s good for debit / credit_cards and can be instigated after 00 days .
M	i had some issues with the website which took me to the wrong page of detailed_information for the item that i needed but the price was right and the check - out process simple .
F	this is the third time i have used etyres . they appealed to me as it is so convenient having them come to your home at no extra_cost and at a time that suits you , the fitters have all been very courteous and friendly .
M	i have ordered a week_ago and still nothing .
F	unhappy
F	we sold 0 phones and got a good price .
F	after one year going to start needing glasses again .
M	they were indeed delivered as promised the next_day .

F	heart in my mouth worrying .
F	i definately will be using them again .
F	!
F	we will use hotel_direct next time we want to book a hotel as the service was first_class .
F	these were presents , and not packed tightly enough .
M	flowers were delivered in a timely_manner , but due to the high ambient temperatures , the flowers were starting to wilt by early evening despite changing to cool water to help them .
F	i ordered online the bandsaw was delivered before the end of the week .
M	if it were my company , i wouldnt hand cars back like it .
M	so checked the prices which were the best available and booked them online on saturday for a fitting on the following_monday at a center near me .
F	when the reorder date came round i wasn_'_t sent a reminder before hand and i got an_email at 00 . 00 on the due date .
F	i am abit disappointed with your site now , which is a shame as i am in a wheelchair , so i don_'_t get to go shopping much .
F	not here until weds this month , not thier usual service level .
F	apart_from that all was ok with the exception of the old photographs for the hotel that i booked in hondaribbia in spain which were very out of date displayed on the alpha_rooms website and the when i mentioned this to the hotel they said they would contact head_office as they had refurbished over 0 years_ago .
F	their customer service group never attends the call .
F	mrs a godley .
F	thank_you , thanks to the driver who delivered who must .
M	different_stories from different " customer service " representatives .
F	after i had told them i would not be using their online shop again !
M	parcel to malta delivered next_day for just £_00 !!
F	will_definately be buying from " perfume - click " again .
F	was surprised to see it because i thought it to be an unusual choice of costume .
M	i selected my frames online on a thursday_lunchtime , added my prescription and hey_presto the glasses were delivered at 00 . 00am saturday .
F	i was a bit_sceptical at first about getting cashback for nothing , but now i never buy or do anything online without checking it first .
M	who builds a company like this . i give them 0 months max before we start seeing yellow vans again !
M	no work completed but payment still processed by rotten_apples .
F	they look great , are easy to use & have not come off and the color has not faded .
F	i ordered a set of car mat and a cover for my soft top when its down ' tonneau cover '.
F	but when i asked for an increase in the amount i can borrow i was denied .
M	overall i couldn_'_t be more pleased , and would happily_recommend e_- hardware .
M	not sure i ' d use them again - lots of hassle for a few_pounds saving
M	let_down by lohn lewis , ao came to our rescue , delivered a bosch oven within 00_hours .
F	i unleash my discontent on their wall and receive the generic " pm me so i can help you " response .
M	cant_fault the data retrieval but the customer service and quoting was questionable at first .
F	i am constantly being told to change my details , confirming that the site isn_'_t safe . my account is inaccessible to me for the majority of the time i need it , i can '_t access my own money as paypal refuses to allow me to amend my own details .
F	0rd specs ( according to online progress ) sat in quality control for several weeks .
M	all in all i couldn_'_t fault their service
F	thankyou
M	rang customer service they sorted it all out and the product was there the next_day .
M	this is a quick and reliable card buys website where you can find and buy what you need on a budget
M	over the last few_months i have had multiple breakages , cleaners showing up when no booking made confirmed phone bookings not being logged on system so i wasted a whole morning waiting for a cleaner that they forgot to book .
F	at_least you know you can get somewhere with them .
M	i contacted the supplier yesterday and received notification that the goods were in the post which i will bet the next_day .
M	but on the rental paper_work it said that when adding another driver it would not be more than $ 0 dollar the exact price was less_than this amount so i thought great i will add my wife to it when i arrive !!!
F	wonder_how flowers will be received after a day at a holding station ?
M	the actuators i ordered arrived a couple of days_later .
F	definitely recommend buying from here .
F	i know , ask the teenage_son who may work it out , but i don_'_t want to .
M	on the day , our selected transporter was prompt , courteous , worked quickly yet safely , and was very reasonably_priced .
M	i will not be using you again .
F	we were in the process of moving_house so didn_’_t open it straight_away left it all wrapped up , in the packaging etc … to open it last sunday to find the dining_table all broken underneath !
F	the only good thing is the quick delivery .
M	!
M	we have used intrerparcel for over 0 years .
M	it would have been more useful for them to specify up front what deductions they make for blemishes and other small things on the phone , because you send it in with one price and then you get a different price in return which you can '_t do much about except accept .
M	dont quite fit car
F	so i returned them - have not yet had a refund but am hopeful that this will be dealt_with soon .
F	perhaps i should have waited to write this once my rug has_been safely collected !
F	the order arrived the next_day as she had said and it was beautifully_packaged .
F	if there is a genuine problem why not keep their customers informed via_email .
F	only_drawback is that returns are not free so if heavy items would cost you quite a bit of money to post back
F	however , i did continue with the booking in the hope that the price doesn_'_t double when i finally learn how much the baggage will add .
F	no phone_call in 00 days to say this .
M	in short , don_'_t bother paying for express delivery .
M	this is not a bad review i really do enjoy using ebay , however it used to be so much_better .
F	second , i want to tell about the troubles i had with recieving my package . after having accepted the agreements and paid , the package was sent straight_away and got to bangkok , thailand , two_days after i paid .
F	fair_enough , we called them .
M	stick with it though , the product is good and very competitive .
F	ordered one day it came the next , would certainly recommend it to animal family and friends , could not have wished for better sevice .
F	when i objected on grounds of cost , they emailed a regular number which i used to order my goods .
F	costume came pretty quickly , was not expecting much , but was expecting it not to be frayed at the waist .
F	that will teach me to read more carefully especially as , as a warfarin taker , my husband can '_t eat cranberries and this was his fathers ' day present .
M	why then was i phoned up , whilst on holiday at the other end of the country , by the courier company wanting to deliver my shed ?
M	i am seriously_considering referring this matter to the relevant trade body or trading_standards .
M	i bought an optoma panoview ds - 0000pmg + screen from here .
M	all my dealings were via_email and pete answered all of my questions almost immediatley , once again great service and thankyou .
M	realisation that time talk was actually a competitor poaching customers from my isp came later , but i stupidly allowed myself to be drawn in .
F	very helpful , very efficient - fast response to both orders and queries .
M	order placed late_afternoon and although standard delivery specified , the package arrived the following_day .
M	you have to wait_till the sale ends so no good if you are in a hurry .
F	when you buy large_quantity of seeds you need longer best before date
F	because my shipping and billing addresses were different , they followed up personally to make_sure that someone wasn_'_t trying to scam my card and they were very prompt in responding that all was well and they would be sending out the garment shortly .
F	i have always used collectplus to send returned items back , never an issue .
F	furthermore the internal floor panels promised by the designer had not been ordered .
M	pleased with the price and delivery . willuse this site again . thankyou , big edd
F	the items i bought from you were for my son who has taken
M	ok experience .
F	for months ive been advised i an eligible for an upgrade by text , i do as the text says , call in to which i wait for 00 - 00 - 00_minutes .
F	he merely delivered it , it wasn_'_t his company providing it .
M	the container did not burst_open due to an impact but rather it simply leaked through an inadequate screw on cap .
M	skin two shirt is fantastic .
M	!
M	what a joke !
F	otherwise there is an area cut through the rocks that leads to flat rocks where you can jump into the sea safely .
F	they also state there processing time is 00 days , it has_been 00 !
F	i feel that they need to do more in x large for women because i love superdry i thinks great value but being on the slightly_bigger side not a lot fits me
F	very hungry
M	would highly_recommend
F	i have emailed them 0 times , over 0_days and got no response .
F	these_beanbags were a gift for our young_children who enjoy reading so i am sure they will have years of fun using them .
F	placed my order a week_ago & have not yet recived it .
F	whether they have delayed site updates or what i don_'_t know why but whoever i emailed should have known my order was already shipped and never confirmed to me when it was shipped after i asked them to .
M	i buy from prosource . net as well and their ups ship rate is $ 0 . 00 no matter the weight or how many items are added .
M	and their prices are competitive too !
F	the product description was not accurate , stated suitable for beginners where in fact it was more of a toy or display product .
M	i '_m not holding my breath !
M	the only reason for this i can think off that could cause so much mess .
M	could not have been easier .
F	- didn_'_t even try to retain me as a customer .
F	we left poor feedback comments twice on parts_gateway site but apart_from the original mediation there has_been no response .
F	not to be forgotten , is the local_solicitor used by key_solutions in featherstone who witnessed our signatures .
F	the product is a good price and my dog seems to enjoy the sausages very much .
F	received phone_call from talk_talk last night agreeing to roll back my contract and arrange free uplift of tv box after registering complaint with them .
M	each item or device sold should match the make and model in the order and meet the following conditions :
M	i resent the accusation that i have been rude , abusive and have threatened you .
F	i noted it – wasn_'_t his problem .
M	ordered glasses seemingly successfully only to be told a couple of days_later that the frames were discontinued .
M	i suspect it is something to do with the rubbish they install in order to earn more money for dsg and try to get unwitting users to part with more cash for one of their over priced " services " from the clueless " tech guys ".
F	i phoned the number from the web_site and couldn_'_t get through , so i emailed my problem , i received a reply that same day and the missing things came the very next working day .
M	an all_round excellent site , i recommend it to everyone .
F	this doesn_'_t stop him from claiming that the " parcel was handed to resident " after he '_s left it somewhere where it '_s likely to get nicked .)
F	no parcel again .
M	i then had to explain to my mother that she has wasted a days holiday also .
M	they delivered what was ordered on time
M	when the canvas arrived and was unpacked i immediately noticed a crease in the canvas which appears to have been there prior to the canvas being framed .
M	why would they have that paragraph about a 000_% cancellation_fee in there terms of agreement ?
M	my wife found the bag having_searched on the internet .
M	i could not then get my normal shot and had to find another source .
M	first time i '_ve_used this company and they have failed to turn_up , not a good first impression on my behalf .
M	gee great !
M	again amazing service . so fast from contact to recieving_cheque just 0 working_days thanks again mazuma
M	i don_'_t know about you but i find this incredibly_rude and i can '_t believe that a good customer has_been banned as a result .
M	i haven_'_t plumbed everything in yet but it all looks easy enough !
F	foot_muffs were also bought , which were next_day delivery , but they didn_'_t arrive either ; they came in the same delivery as the stroller .
F	our over all experience with interparcel is great , reliable and efficient , we send out many parcels and they are in the main delivered as per agreements .
F	i am very pleased with the calendars as such .
F	unfortunately none of these were included .
M	checked if items in stock , i was informed by fawkes when they were in stock and ordered them the same day , items arrived in 0 days , exactly_what i wanted .
M	i will be holding off purchases till stock issues and sizing have been corrected , or at_least become consistent .
F	would deffinately buy from you again very good price and delivery excellent service
M	i ordered my protein during the jubilee_weekend .
M	delivered on time and in perfect_condition .
M	in discussions with the dollar_rental staff they stated the rental code ' fleur ' required the purchase of a full_tank of gas with no option to opt for returning the car in the same fuel state as when hired .
F	prices rising , car delivered to airport gone up from £_00 to £_00 - how can that kind of increase be acceptable ?
M	well_done mazuma !
M	the flowers had a nice hand_written card attached and looked good when they arrived .
F	i will never , ever , ever , ever , ever touch these people again with a bargepole .
M	the only thing that let the order down was that the repair kit and poster were send in the same parcel and due to the weight of the repair kit the poster arrived with several creases in it and doesn_'_t look 000_%.
F	i ordered garden_furniture to the value of £_000 and when it arrived it was brown and not black as i ordered .
M	hmm still_waiting !
F	quick to respond , the flyers were printed the next_day and dispatched that evening .
M	very poor service and overlay charged to be put on hold and not dealt_with .
M	thankyou for reading this post , any help or advice would be greatly appreicated , since at the moment im realy restraining myself from emailing them telling them im going to take them to court
F	this company is highly_recommended for their good service and excellent prices
F	first time i have ever sold a mobile phone - didn_'_t_believe_how easy it could be .
M	would recomend that you take your milage reading and ensure that the car is inspected thoroughly before you leave it .
F	again when they eventually did find the order i was told that unfortunately the sunglasses were no_longer available as they had been_discontinued several_years_ago .
F	good service going , friendly and prompt .
M	we chased them once a week for a follow_up for 0_weeks as each time they promised an update in 0 days time , but and then complete silence .
M	informed delivery date , but any time from 0 : 00 - 00 : 00 .
F	you advertise flights at a very cheap deals and when i pressed to book , you select any country for destination , i am very angry with this site . i would not recommend anyone use this site
M	exact time is unknown as the card is incomplete .
F	they would not refund my payment .
F	sent on monday and i had them both back on wednesday - engagement_ring nicely polished ( as good as new !)
M	i could send a parcel home to dublin in less time and not using a courier .
M	but , no_worries here and you do get a quality article for your money .
M	fitting was not too hard as i had a socket to connect it to already .
F	the delivery will take a few_days but the driver was very friendly unlike_some other company drivers !
M	my order arrived within 00_hrs .
M	it was well over your stated deliveries .
M	def_use again .
F	i '_m still_waiting for a call to let_me know what is happening
M	get this right and some communication to the customer , email is fine and you will get five_stars .
M	to summarise them in a few words .
F	i also knew there was a tiny_scratch on the camera but nothing considerable , i have taken many great photos without this affecting it .
M	very easy to use website , a smooth_transaction - would defiantly use again and again 00 / 00
F	flowers looked just as good as they did on the website .
M	i hope it will be done by end of the month !
M	by this time i could not be_bothered to cancel the process and buy the item from other source that would have saved me a couple of pounds , and continued with the postage .
F	i had confirmation and dispatch emails ( always reassuring !!)
M	courier messed_up .
F	good product and price and when used before great accuracy re stock and delivery .
F	i ordered roses for my elderly_mother '_s birthday .
F	even_though used bubblewrap / a towel and cardboard !!
F	the same goes for car parts .
M	everything was fine
M	however , the headrest mounts supplied do not fit volvos and in my email to the company seeking clarification on this , they referred me to the mounts they sell separately ( supplied by brodit ).
M	if you bring your card you may well get even more channels all in all a good villa , hire some bikes and take a ride around town
M	delivery arrived as promised , and well_packaged .
F	the month and day part of the calendar are tiny , and practically_impossible to see at any distance and you are not able to make any notes or appointments .
M	great service and delivery
F	particularly pleased that i could get the baltic lake carpet that i knew would fit another tent at an amazing price .
F	i then had to pay to send back the items after being told i would not be able to return them to store for return of cash .
F	told they would be with us week 00 before christmas and they didn_'_t arrive .
F	took it in for aircon service , booked online - painless .
M	efficient , friendly and eminently huggable !
M	don_'_t like systems where a pick_up is involved however they came at a decent
M	do not use and use other cashback_sites to which i have not had problems before !
F	firstly i tried to return a top and easily arranged a return on their site and a message came up saying it would be collected within 0_days !
M	waiting item not yet with me so no comment as yet
M	there may be some brands not listed , and the odd string slightly_cheaper_elsewhere , but generally strings_direct has_been my port of call for many_years .
M	dispatched wednesday 00 june . unfortunally the item , order number0000000 has not yet been delivered .
F	i was impressed that i didnt have to spend an extortionate_amount to receive free_postage too .
F	having more than 00 years of experience within the hospitality and services industires with the usa , germany and the uk , i know what i am talking_about .
F	however , i was disappointed as the flowers on the orchids themselves were basically almost towards the end of their life .
F	good and interesting deals but i would love to see more long_haul holidays and cruises .
F	i am a loyal_customer of the trainline .
M	delivery was next_day as promised .
M	the post_office counter even told me to pay extra for peace of mind as it needs to be signed for otherwise it '_s returned to myself !
M	it is good to know that our logo is being kept for future orders .
M	works as promised !
M	it actually arrived a day later .
F	0_weeks_later i contacted kiddies - kingdom again and was now told it wouldn_'_t be available until june as it was a new item .
M	received the confirmation_email within 00_minutes
F	i will not be booking with inghams again and will instead return to crystal or go back to making independent bookings next time i go to canada .
F	perhaps woolovers could_learn a few lessons in quality sweaters from places like marks and spencer and topshop .
F	i still cant figure_out how to wear them and i will have to make some straps myself which actually fit .
F	a relative staying with her contacted me to advise as they left for the party , that no flowers has_been delivered .
M	items in stock .
F	however i tried to explain it they would only refund £ 0 as £ 0 . 00 was the charge for a 0 day delivery .
F	little frustrating for the price of the machine but it is still a time saver in its own way
F	00 / 00 !
F	so far i have had no_problems with parcel delivery ; and the places i take the parcels for shipping are also very efficient .
F	it didn_'_t take long to assemble the 00ft trampolin the main problem was keeping the legs up .
M	and interlink delivered it the next_day as promised .
F	was easy to use , good website with lots of choice and product was a bounty_offer so very good value for money my only_negative is the very expensive delivery charge would definitely put me off using the site again and only i was getting such a good discount on the item i probably_wouldn_'_t have paid it i '_d have looked elsewhere .
F	was looking for a gas_bbq with lava rocks at a good price .
F	not flexible for example i have annual_insurance for 0 but only i ski so when i asked for a week add on for me to ski the answer was just a straight no .
F	apparently you would not reveal the full name of the sender because of confidentiality regulations !
M	it has_been over a month since i initially placed my order and i '_m still_waiting .
F	i had to ring the company but the lady on the telephone was exceedingly helpful .
F	the order took about a week to arrive , the quality was fantastic , better_than i had expected as i didn_'_t order the most expensive fabrics .
F	i got an_email from them today saying they were out of stock .
M	wwhere the service fell down was that had i not have logged on to the tracker i would not have known .
F	i make fabrication for spear gun
F	never received my order , when they kept emailing me , i gave them an order for my dog flea_treatment , was told next_day it would arrive , and 0_days_later nothing , it took them all afternoon to email back , i wont use them again , but the emails were polite .
M	however , after i realised the marks largely could be removed with a damp cloth and a lot of rubbing , i did both and i ended_up with the boots i had hoped for .
F	booked glasgow_airport_parking the week after and they do not charge anything for paying by credit_cards .
F	i don_'_t need to explain my case .
F	tha cheaper one is much_better value .
M	they have always been reasonably_priced , if not always the lowest in the market place , but their speed of delivery , quality of packaging and friendliness are second to none .
M	approximately a 00 cm height crack with a very wide gap , running from the base upwards .
M	thank_you very much
M	item was marked as dispatched last monday via cash_generator confirmation_email but then actually only dispatched this tuesday as notified by paypal .
F	what a pleasure_dealing_with this company , they were reliable , have a simple ordering system , good communication , speedy delivery and great selection of watches to choose from .
F	when i have bought shower_trays in the past they have come with the legs .
M	they are clearly the same people , same names , e_- mail address , telephone_numbers and address .
M	good templates for my purposes , which are mainly to communicate with friends across the world .
M	i used this service and i '_m very happy .
M	then 0_weeks_later received a shipped email with dhl .
F	will definitely be shopping with partyrama in the future : 0 )
F	i bought the initial item as a gift , it was returned but recipient was unable to choose something_else .
F	it has_been 0_months now and this kafkaian situation still_hasn_'_t been solved with my bank saying they never received the money because the credit_card was canceled and travel_nation saying that they already processed the refund .
M	got an order which was accidentally missing 0kg of chicken_breasts .
M	however , play did refund me and communication was good , albeit quite a wait to have to process a refund .
M	verdict_: if you value your time , then don_'_t use sagepay and elavon and certainly don_'_t believe the sales people or their website that says it '_s a quick and easy process .
F	i therefore cancelled my policy but of course the online quotation wouldn_'_t say if i would be owed or if i would owe money .
F	the quality is excellent and the prices reasonable - i was eligible for free_p_&_p which really pleased me , and plus i have some new pots and pans , a great looking red , retro kitchen clock and timer etc .
F	what '_s not to like ?
F	i compared prices and animed came out tops .
F	i did have more prints i wanted in the book but hadn_'_t the patience to do anymore .
F	!
M	i never got to see the flowers as they were a gift so a photo of the flowers would have been the cherry on an otherwise ace service .
F	the items ordered arrived in a jiffy_bag and this is fine but the items inside were covered in grey dust which went_onto the items when unpacked .
M	i retook the eye_test and they said they needed to lower the prescription just slightly and to call them back in a week when glasses were made up again with new prescriptions .
M	calling me " boss "??!?!?!?
F	the delivery was at 0 :_00pm .
F	i wouldnt be so quick to blame the courier , mp are marking items as dispatched without actually dispatching them by the looks of things , please sort it out !
M	i was very surprised and happy about the fast delivery .
F	it was amazing !
F	so comfortable , even climbing at 00_degrees c !
M	they start charging for their call package even before your line is switched to them !
F	parking is good but 0 % credit_card charge is a bit much .
M	it arrives a few_days_later very well secured and packaged .
F	then it went all downhill after that .
F	she said the flowers were " lovely " and was very pleased with them .
M	after another round of hugely emotional calls we eventually get an engineer over , who has_been sub - contracted , and spends two hours achieving nothing and totally contradicts everything we '_ve been told before leaving us stranded .
F	only problem is they do not stock them but i think have access to other specialist shops ?
F	we have managed to use the tracking device which was still in use on handset and shall be sending our proof of this been a fraudulent company to trading_standards as they still deny handling / received handset which evidently is not the case .
M	i had a look under engine that night and discovered a bolt was missing from the bottom metal radiator hose where it bolts to the subframe , put a bolt in , knock gone .
M	went elsewhere , haven_'_t been back .
F	they are completely_useless and this has_been the case on several_occasions .
M	i will not be ordering with you again
F	but thanks anyway
M	emails keep you informed of the delivery process .
M	!
F	ive had to pay £_000 in plumber fees due to the cistern being of such cheap quality that it kept allowing water to trickle into the pan .
F	this is a delay that is disappointing and stressful for us .
M	super service og_hurtig_levering :-)
F	i have used this company on several_occassions now and have been extremely satisfied with the service and product .
F	when we contacted them by phone customer service were really unhelpful , and couldnt seem to make their minds up on whether they did read the proofs or not ?
M	wanted some gift_voucher , used the very easy website and the vouchers were delivered to me with in a couple of days .
F	she then told us that if we joined ' flyblue ' we would get one item of luggage checked in for free .
F	they always provide excellent service - high_quality items , fast delivery , advice about their products , quick response to any question .
F	great .
M	as it turned_out , i ran_out of time and needed the amp urgently .
M	would recommend to anyone .
F	once they got a hold of my phone it was only worth £_00 . you guys will not be getting your hands on any more of my old_phones !!!!!
F	my auntie jeanie phoned to say what a lovely surprise and just how wonderful the flower '_s were .
F	however , it seems a little unprofessional to advertise goods that you are not in a position to provide and the poor communication would make me wary of ordering larger items from this company in the future .
M	no answer to the order confirmation_email they send so i go on the web_site and fill out a " contact us " page
F	and the next lens i want is cheaper in the uk anyway !
M	used before for shoes but never a racket and not very trusting with stringers as have had many bad restrings .
F	called wahanda and was told ' your call is now next in the queue ' over and over again for over 00_mins before i was hung_up on .
M	during the ordering_process , there is a section ' special delivery instructions ' - i duly stated that if i was out to leave the parcel in my garden under the patio or in greenhouse .
M	they are ok but given the cost to return and the associated hassle i am better off keeping them , especially when they can '_t even be_bothered to reply to my email .
F	loved it and want to go back now !!
M	order was made late november and subsequent email to the company requesting a proposed alteration has remained unanswered - still_haven_'_t received the order even_tho delivery date of dec 00 was stated on order - quite a sentimental xmas_present ruined - just hope it turns_up at some point in new year
M	for example 0 . 0l diamond hard varnish £_00 . 00 vs £_00 in b_& q .
M	i never once requested this for a christmas delivery in fact my email quite clearly_states that it was a gift for the end of the month .
M	i ' d been in the same job for 00 years and hadn_'_t kept my cv up to date so when it came time to move on it had become a mammoth task .
M	having spent time in the photographic retail trade myself i can thoroughly_recommend speed_graphic for their knowledgable_staff and speedy service .
M	topcashback has_been great , it lists some amazing deals and even rewards you to take them .
M	i had pre ordered a game around 0 - 0 months it was actually released and then it comes late .
F	i know on the website it fully makes you aware that some invitations you need to make up yourself but when my invitations did arrive i had to tie my own bows , with me not been very good at this i felt the invitation didn_'_t quite look as nice , so would have much preferred for them to be done for me even if it was an extra_cost .
M	the night time tour that we went on with a local guide was excellent too .
M	it '_s refreshing in this day and age when you come_across a company that places customer_satisfaction at the top of their
F	yet after getting a phone_call from my close relative explaining she had received flowers i went round to see the quality .
M	they have even gone to the trouble to cancel the email address that we were given for contacting them
M	she_loved the flowers and they were beautiful but just a leaking bag let it down as she needed to find somewhere to put them in water whilst in work .
F	according to dfs the customer is never right !!
F	i have only been with scottish_power for 0_months and have never in my life known anything like it .
F	rubbish i '_d clearly booked just that !
F	when i went back to the store i explained what i had been told , i was informed that nothing was noted regarding this and if this had been agreed they would of been informed so they would have to ring through to customer_services to confirm this agreement , i was made to feel that i was trying to pull a fast one .
M	total rubbish , don_'_t waste your time here , go to b_& q
M	thinking all was now well , i looked forward to the imminent arrival of my order , but it '_s now 00 days since my order , no reply to phone message to chase , no reply to email chasing ( sent last_week ) and seemingly no nearer getting the product .
F	i recently started_using wowcher when i saw a great deal for a break away to find that i could not book for 0_days after i had paid and that the only time i could go was not available .
F	and i haven_'_t worked out how to scroll up page onmy tab yet !
F	kate hopkins
M	mp0_player as gift - so cheap and its worthless - better not give gifts !
M	only down_side is in order to make the most out of their service you need to know what you want ( its not like going to pc_world etc ).
F	the efficiency of your company with the actual order when it was placed was very good .
M	the villa furthermore was very dirty , the beds were very short ( 0 ' 0 ") and as our boys were 0 ' 0 " and 0 ' 0 " respectively were unfit for purpose .
F	it was a fantastic service , i was really happy with how quick it was and how soon the money was in my bank .
M	will_def_use again !
F	the order comes quickly .
M	the customer service then was brilliant , and the value for money couldn_'_t be_beaten anywhere , even by the other jewellers in birmingham '_s jewellery_quarter .
M	great product .
M	the process was simple to follow , the store was quick to acknowledge my returned order and i was reimbursed shortly_afterwards .
M	!
M	i had to chase up and they arrived 0 - 0 working_days after ordering , what '_s the point ?
F	good prices too !
M	even with the gesture we spent a considerable_amount of time of chasing this up as at one stage it seemed like an invisible offer .
F	still_haven_'_t got the part but the phone operator was helpful and said would refund my payment .
F	good product and perfect for the job !
F	also refunds on delivery charges should be automatic if they do not arrive on time .
M	will use them again without_reservation .
M	it would have been helpful if the size could be mentioned on the website .
F	fantastic service - many_thanks !
F	reasonable_prices .
M	!
M	and the real_bonus was a free next_day delivery slot !
F	used it several_times - quicker_than dialing direct .
M	cons_:
M	but - don_'_t add the booking_fee art the end - be honest and either include it in your prices ( it '_s not as if it '_s an optiona ; extra ) or show it up front .
F	i ordered from this site as they were the cheapest retailer of ultradex .
F	unless this improves , i will order elsewhere next time .
F	would not recommend this company at all , i am so disappointed and have never felt so undervalued as a customer - absolute_joke .
M	the original installation was quoted to be 0 or 0 days but 0 months on and it still isn_'_t finished .
M	i appreciate that this is not active_mobility '_s fault as the supplier accepted the order .
M	it doesn_'_t say excluding saturdays , it specifically offers the service on a saturday , it doesn_'_t say excluding certain postcodes . in the end i rang the local_florist and was able to go collect the flowers later that day .
F	unfortunately there were problems with delivery by the carrier , calberson , but the shower doors and parois were fine once we managed to get_hold of them .
M	what an utter lie - our place is so easily_accessible its not true .
F	had to chase a number of times , by telephone , before items were delivered .
F	why don_'_t they have the decency to ring and discuss my problem .
F	some good deals to be had but also some very disappointing ones .
M	i have no_hesitation in recommending this company .
M	ordered a riedel sommeliers single_malt_whisky crystal glass ( height : 000mm 0 0 / 0 "), arrived quickly within 00 hr after the email notification .
M	the cost of the room was shown in pounds_sterling , the final booking in dollars but no declaration of exchange_rate .
M	awful experience and total_lack of customer service .
F	a simple email or phone_call was all i expected to inform_me that they could not full - fill my order but they don_'_t seem to respect their customers enough even to do this .
M	( which is in mint_condition , withought a single mark .)
M	i ordered my appliance over three_months_ago .
M	added to this is the no argument return_policy and you have a winner .
F	we always use the long_stay parking at the airport and never had any_problems until this booking because we bought the cheap deal no amendments allowed unfortunately i put in the wrong return date as it was after midnight when we would be out of the airport there was no way to amend the date within the site straight after you have paid i understand the rules of no cancellations / refunds but i wanted to correct an_error and though the staff were polite when i explained what i had done they could not help not good customer service from the management side in saying that i have booked them for our further trips away this year as it is handy and i double_check the dates
M	the quality of the gear0music electo accustic guitar seems to be high considering the price paid although i haven_'_t had time to really play it , but from the time i '' ve spent it '_s got a good sound .
M	came_across valueshops website when i was searching the net for cannon inks for our printer , after_searching there site for our cannon inks i found there price to be very competitive indeed they infact beat all outher suppliers i checked by approx_£ 0 . 00 per ink_cartridge which is quite a saving over the long_term . i will always buy from valueshop from now on
F	thank_you so much .
M	quickly updated as to the status the process was in and fast payment .
F	e_- mailed fhr asking if my original payment could be refunded got no reply so phoned them to be told they could not refund me as i had used the car_park , albeit for 0 hours , and i had not given 00_hours notice to cancel .
F	great value product .
F	i explained i had already had a text to say delivery will be 00 / 0 / 00 and then another stating between 0 - 00am .
M	my bandwidth is ok , so i assume the speed issue was at the supplier level .
M	- you can '_t phone them ( they have no numbers )
M	rimless - didn_'_t fit well , was told it was only a ' little short ' which is wasn_'_t -- exchanged for a second pair
M	this time i was told that the guy would find out what was happening and would call me back himself .
M	no e_- mail_confirming_receipt , no e_- mail_stating any_problems , no listing !
M	i still shop their a lot though , so they must be doing something right :-)
F	i '_m a regular customer at photobox and after this recent_purchase i will still be a regular customer to photobox .
F	good range but rather expensive .
F	the goods have always arrived in mint_condition , and i have always had the full order .
M	i wish people would stop rating this complete scam of a company with 0 or 0_stars .
M	a real comfort , nothing officious just a direct solution .
F	it shows lots of options in terms of time slots for flights and costs .
F	havent_seen the flowers yet but recipient was pleased .
F	i can recommend chemist_direct .
F	groupon have reset the code and it isnt working and no - one from this company is getting back to me .
F	so buy something for you - not the house , not the kids , not the other half - something for you - a guilt free present that costs you absolutely nothing .
M	if you like this type of deals website maybe use groupon .
F	i usually buy them from my local specsavers for £_00 so i '_ll be staying with them .
F	bought the battery for a mobile phone which had gone dead .
F	batteries which i could not find in the shops arrived very quickly and worked properly .
F	0_stars for service , 0_stars for morals .
M	no real chatty email though , just a thank_you
F	orange recycling was really easy to use and i received the maximum amount for my phone straight_into my bank_account .
F	this should be made clear on the website .
F	i had a couple of queries and it was great to be able to speak to a real_person .
F	no_quibble 00 day returns guarantee .
F	they also said that the order would still be dispatched as they couldnt contact the warehouse . i then asked what courier they would use so i could reject the parcel , and they couldnt give me those details either !
M	vincent
M	i placed the free material over the side windows as it tells you to but after 0_weeks i removed the cover only to find the roof light had small swirl marks where it had moved around slightly .
M	it is to be given as a xmas_present & as it has only arrived today 00th_december , no time to get it replaced .
F	allowing for the substitution clause , i would still expect the same use of large blooms and emphasis on the chosen main colour but the arrangement was not the same .
F	so little time !
M	extensive_research led me to muxu or rapha jeans .
M	most tolls are near the airport and most resorts and villas do not need to use toll_roads for the majority of your stay to get around the theme_park locations .
F	i had an old laptop which i was planning to sell on ebay when i remembered sites like music_magpie which would recycle it for free .
F	i also e_- mailed the customer complaints_dept who said the same thing in a slightly more polite way .
F	i don_'_t go_anywhere_else .
F	the messages received to know when the book was completed and despatched was as good as any other company i '_ve_used and better_than most .
F	000_% genuine !
M	i am disappointed and angry by complete_care shop '_s clear lack of respect for their customer .
M	still no sign of my product .
F	very disappointed as i was told it would be there by friday .
M	it had not been arranged very well , the flowers where not what i would call a0 in condition and i could not help wishing that i had just gone to a local_florist with £_00 as i feel i would have got a far better bouquet .
F	when it came to the delivery of the items , we received a call to inform us that the van was 00 - 00_mins_away .
M	the bench itself is good except in one respect .
M	i went to look at buying a polo from here and the sales staff was very friendly and he said i could have the car for 0 , 000 including 00months mot , a full service , 0 months tax included if i buy the car .
M	no one replied with what was happening - i only got an e_- mail ( basically the same one from the courier and the vendor ) at the beginning of the next_day saying that the part would be delivered that day .
M	was well in the web_site but we did not received any thing
F	please bear in mind that once a refund has_been issued it can take up to 0 working_days for the transaction to show on your statement .
M	.
M	just delivered next_day - arrived only next_day - who needs flowers if they do not arrive on time - people could have been out of the country next_day .
M	never got a reply from them ever again , and still have my money and refuse to accept they have taken money out of my account .
M	surprise_surprise , i have now received a demand ( on the sp website ) from a collections company basically telling my to pay up or else .
M	highly_recommended .
F	the wellies arrived in record_time , they ' re an ezcellent product and i will be using this company again
F	the items i bought were keenly_priced and were delivered very quickly .
M	neil
M	very disappointing
F	product just as_described .
M	sigma agreed to change it without_any issue .
F	i think someone had repackaged whilst having a quick cigarette !
M	however it turned_out this was incorrect information as a hamper did get delivered .
M	a shame .
F	i telephopne customer_services on 00th_may_0000 to again complain_about the smell but to date nothing has_been done and the wardrobe is still smelling .
M	don_'_t waste your time .
M	first of all trouble started when i brought a muti gym from uk sport_imports , parts were damaged , sent me extra parts that i did not require and the parts i had did not fit correctly .
M	highly_recommended , will_definitely be using them again in the future
F	when i found out , i emailed to ask when they would be available and was told 0_weeks .
F	again , the print work and the product were very high_quality - they far_exceeded our expectations in every way .
F	we had only hear bad_reviews about stoneacre but it was the only place that sold a car my daughter wanted .
F	so i emailed wowcher it '_s self who haven_'_t even replied to me .
F	i would recommend cookersandovens but i would also recommend people search the internet for a better deal as my purchase from cookersandovens was due to wanting a specific oven that most others suppliers did not stock .
M	everything was very easy to follow from the music_magpie website .
F	i found the brew to be much weaker , lacking in taste , flavour and depth .
F	there was no card through the door and so it was obvious no one had attempted a delivery .
F	shocking company that has terrible customer_services .
F	all my items were in excellent condition so i had no quality issues queried .
M	the products i purchased are up to what i expected
F	the tree was stunning .
F	tried every diy_store possible and couldn_'_t find one .
M	all at a cost of £_000 for 0 tickets + £_00 cancelled ( non_refundable ) hotel + £_000 train_ticket journey .
M	she explained the deal to him and he became very aggressive and said the deal did not include 0 months tax , !!
F	thank_you for a brilliant service :)
F	i haven_'_t got any flights ????
F	we asked for them to be the same as the last fitting just 0_months earlier yet this did not happen .
F	i have purchased every_single plant in my garden from crocus and my garden is blooming and growing beautifully .
F	not good ann_summers !!
M	this seems to me to be a bizarre arrangement but i duly ordered the tyre and returned to have it fitted .
F	for a fee i arranged for someone to collect the bed on my behalf .
M	well , that '_s exactly_what they did !
F	i received the item nearly 0_weeks after order placed .
M	( not a happy_bunny )
M	not yet planted as arrived 0 hours ago .
F	i purchased flowers for my daughters_birthday a while ago and was thrilled with them , so i decided to order some more for my friend who has_been poorley , i decided to go a little more_expensive and was so dissapointed at the lack of flowers , colour and arrangement , when i saw them next to other_peoples flowers i might have well gone to aldi and purchashed a lot more colourful flowers .
M	however , the radiator has 000mm pipe centres .
F	my disabled aunt and i bought a used car off them in march which was faulty .
M	good communication , have used several_times now and always best prices for fitflops !
M	i have had varying magnets and i must_say they far exceed the parameters given on the net .
M	the coloured 000 will not load correctly and i have ben forced to buy a cannon which is far more_expensive .
F	no chase_up calls , no_fuss !
M	i purchased my part with one company but , it got damaged in transit .
F	price was comparable with other stores but , customer service was second to none .
F	fantastic free deliverys and returns .
M	my experience with this company from_start to finish was first_class .
F	meat missing , rang to rectify .
F	it was well_packed , exactly as_described and £_00 cheaper_than_anywhere_else on the web .
F	they were soon dashed when i smelt the toilet in my room !.
M	please also note : double standards : groupon usa will refund your money upto 0 years after the voucher has expired however groupon uk will not refund not .
M	delivery very quick , staff friendly .
F	i called again asking if they could send me a new headset now that we '_ve tried the factory restart and confirmed that the hardware is faulty .
M	the go_karting was an excellent activity !
M	np are now in my favourites .
F	i ordered 0 clocks and a trophy .
F	coat in good condition - fits_perfectly and is keeping_me lovely and warm !
M	they are not a real car parking company and are not supported_by any organisations that regulates car parking .
F	i cannot stress enough how disappointed and upset the whole episode made me and my family at one of the worst times possible .
F	the order was quick to arrive and all the products had long use by dates .
F	we bought a new build and fu were forced upon us as the developer chose them . stupidly .
M	my experience of this company is awful . take a look at this transcript from the emails i '_ve been getting .
F	fantastic furniture on the whole but just a little attention to detail needed .
M	perfect service , ordered the part , it came 0 days earlier_than it said , great value and great service , thankyou
F	really , really annoyed .
M	in fairness to via gogo a full_refund as been payed thank_you now 00 . 00 . 00

F	shame on you viagogo , disgusting service .
F	i have no trouble with delivery or any items
M	on closer_inspection the angle of the moulding was about 00_degrees .
F	the cross however was beautiful .
M	you should return my money with paypal and stop messing me around .
M	their prices may be cheap but their logistical organisation and response is woeful .
F	i was advised of the price straight_away for my choice .
F	not much of a complaint really , but no unpacking service is offered , so we had no choice but to struggle .
M	terrible company .
F	we also found the lack of information also not helpful and i had to go a few_times to ask for news as it was christmas_eve i had a very worried 0 and 0 year not knowing if they would be home in time for santa coming or if he would be able to find them .
F	very flimsy felt type fabric .
F	most of the flowers were on the decline and some had already had to be pulled_out of the display .
F	the products have been received on time .
M	given that my new phone cost £_000 i am now in profit and someone_else will get to benefit from my old phone .
F	not happened with viovet - price , service and reliability has remained totally constant .
F	secondly , i paid an extra £ 0 . 00 for a bigger ' bunch '.
M	very pleased with the ease of my transaction and the postage of my mobile to mazuma .
F	will not use again would prefer nearer the airport .
M	my insurance is due now so i phoned them to renew , i ask them to do better with the quote they sent me , they refused to look and told me to go online at esure and i may get it cheaper , then i asked them to put me through to the retention department otherwise i will leave them for good , they would not put me through to them and just told me they can deal with this , then informed me that i have not been covered for the last 0 years with them because my full name is not on the policy , i said " you are a joke , just a scam not to pay out if i needed to make a claim !, and why has no one informed me of this problem before !
F	i knew_exactly_what was happening with my order and even what time it arrived at her door .
F	so in the end payed £ 0 delivery which was the price of one of the so - called ' free tops '!
F	lovely to know that crafts and skills and talent remain in your corner of the world !
F	smooth and although i thought it might be a bit fraught because we were meeting the guy up on one of the floors of the short_stay parking_bays , he was there on time and we felt he was very trustworthy .
M	waited in again for the correct delivery two_days_later and the rocking chair did arrive .
M	branches are staffed by not very bright sale people who have absolutely no interest in helping you .
F	i wasn_'_t sure about ordering these albums , i ordered 0 one for my mum for christmas & one for me .
M	such a small tube of 0 % hyrdrocortisone cream was put in a huge box for postage .
M	still no receipt i chased again and told they do not know when i would receive the goods .
M	found that it was a good shopping_experience . thing came promptly with no_problems .
M	i returned a faulty item for replacement .
M	easy jet should be renamed hardist jet .
F	lt seemed very secure & reassuring .
M	re the security problem , i sent an email on 00 / 00 /_0000 to the company stating my concerns and asking for an explanation but as of today ( 0th_july ) there has_been no response .
M	great to deal with and only too pleased to help with any enquiry .
M	both cars in front had difficulties leaving .
F	not only was the price great but the service exceeded my expectations .
M	whcih was a bit_disappointing for my relative '_s 00th_birthday .
F	awesome , turbo delivery .
F	the pillows were not in the parcel so i tried_ringing them .
F	purchased a new contract over the phone on 00th_october .
F	i got a quick fast and very courteous service .
F	same as the last reviewer .
M	and at yodel , we have the scale and capacity to make it happen .
M	what did surprise was that the shoes , worth £_000 , were left on the front_doorstep following a knock on the door .
F	the description of the products and the price was excellent , i phoned your company with a couple of queries , which put my mind at rest , convinced i purchased the 00m heavy_duty rotary_line .
F	it looked like we could have been abroad , if only we have better weather !
F	however with pest_control supplies it was first_class .
M	all the staff were amazing and very friendly , sadly though once it was all over and the surgeon said no to a touch up laser i was left in the dark , no options given or offered .
M	the tape works great and good grip too . supports against the strain and keeps hold to reduce aches and pains
M	other than that , fair_play to you juno !
F	next_day delivery with estimated times .
F	on a sunday morning we like if possible to have something from the mcdonalds breakfast menu , this would always be the same things for my son & myself it is the egg & bacon bagel meal & my husband has a sausage & egg mcmuffin , an easy order wouldn_'_t you say , it seems not when it comes to our local mcdonalds the last 0 times yes 0 times my husband has_been to the restaurant he has come_back with egg & bacon mcmuffins despite telling the person serving exactly_what we wanted & asking them to make_sure & check ( & getting the look that would kill ) , as the parking is difficult ( main_road , parking restrictions everywhere ) my husband has to be as quick as possible so its only when he has got home and given us our orders that we have discovered yet again they have got it wrong even_though ( as i have mentioned earlier ) my husband insisted they checked the order , it may seem petty but if i went into a shop & asked for a bottle of milk i would not expect to get a bottle of lemonade , i actually hate mcmuffins so i was not best pleased on 0 occasions to have them instead of bagels !
F	as i live in an apartment_block , i had no idea of how i was supposed to know they were delivering my parcel and needed me to sign for it .
F	easy to get through on the phone and everyone i have spoken too are friendly and helpful .
M	i found many other_sites were offering replacement parts that were not genuine and about the same price or in some cases more .
F	hello what do you use to text ?
F	this jacket did what it said , it is waterproof and warm , bought this for my son , who rides a motor scooter , he isaid it was warm and kept the wind and rain out he is really pleased with the quality .
F	would recommend !
F	this was denied and i was told that they had a ' tolerance ' for sizes and that i should have ordered a sample if the bag was for a purpose !
M	fast delivery and great prices
F	no sink_unit - no refund - no communication .
M	any other company would have issued a replacement on monday_morning , keeping the customer away from any internal investigation , but no , i have to suffer because their choice of courier lost my parcel .
F	arrived quickly .
F	service has_been super after my issues appeared after op but non the less i now have to start paying for glasses again after 00 weeks !
M	being a low one they still kept me informed by email of goods being sent
F	then a friend introduced me to chemists direct and for the price of two prescriptions i bought the same thing in 000g pump action dispensers ( which in themselves made life so much_easier ) and i am not afraid to use it , as i know i can always get some more i no_longer have to scratch all day and i can leave the house , i have a life .
M	i '_ve ordered batteries a few_times and they '_ve always arrived very promptly .
F	order - to the extent that i missed the cut - off point for delivery date , very , very disappointing .
F	it was delivered to the room , unpacked and placed just as i directed and the delivery team were friendly and helpful .
M	surveyor and fitters were excellent and we now have a kitchen we love .
M	with some effort on my part i will make the bracket work but most people do not have the time , energy and expertise necessary to do this .
F	as it was late on sunday_evening i rang on monday_morning to change the address but it had already been dispatched .
M	ordet acknowleged quickly
M	having made many calls to easygate i had to rely_on the e_- mail system for advice but when i received the reply it directed me to contact [_link ].
F	her work was obviously piling up and as she said the situation had to go to customer service department .
M	however as we head into autumn you now have to apply the code , and if like me you are a bannerman you can only apply one code where as previously you could apply both codes .
F	poor service from dpd - they didn_'_t deliver on first scheduled day , and gave no reason for this , which was incredibly_frustrating , given i was waiting at home all afternoon and evening for the parcel .
M	once this done , tablets came within a couple of days .
F	i asked to speak to the supervisor who had passed the call to him ( mario i think ) but instead was put through to a heavily accented supervisor called rheyn suabez who told me it was not possible to return the box without_incurring a charge and that i had agreed to an_extension to my contract and the distance_selling rules and 00 day cooling_off period did not apply as i had connected the device the night before .
F	beautiful glasses . arrived so quickly with excellent packaging .
F	if i had not done this every time it would add up to about £_00 just in the last few_months .
F	i am looking for a holiday in salzburg , austria and have not found what i am looking for with last_minute , although they are the first people to come up on a web search they don_'_t do it for me .
F	).
F	however the returns system isn_'_t great , the wording of the way to return items is quite aggressive in terms of the condition .
F	ordered on monday didn_'_t receive until saturday .
F	i was going to order two but decided to order three as there was a special_offer of a gift .
M	all automated now then it will cut you off
M	first_impressions are great and the samples that we ordered were quick and a true_reflection of the final product .
F	just one suggestion : as a single working person , i am never at home to receive the parcel and so have to make time to trek_across to the po sorting_office which is a pain .
F	cubby under bed had hair and dirt inside .
F	why would you not use it ?.
F	i '_m definitely going down the small courts route .
F	they told me the goods were out for dispatch and apologized that i '_d not received the notification which then landed in my inbox immediately .
F	i had wanted the thing quickly so it was a bit_annoying but at_least they put it right with minimal_fuss .
M	otherwise ok . post times now have reached an unacceptable delay , not saa fault but post_office '_s .
M	i agreed as everything was correct .
M	i am only giving one star because this survey will not allow me to give none !
F	!
F	as soon as i realised they had taken money without my consent i cancelled my subscription but they still took more money .
M	on to the next thing they ripped me off with .
M	very easy .
F	now this in itself is not a problem but i had had to pay extra to get a card with all the details on it !!!
F	), an item was returned and credited two_weeks before direct_debit was taken , i don_'_t think my bank should sort_out this issue .
M	i used this and went to the sending location only to be told i needed he label with the barcode .
F	at the time i did not have enough money to chance insurance providers so had to continue with the monthly_payments which started at around £_00 , later rising to £_00 . 00 , then we were told that we would be getting a refund taking the monthly_payments down to £_00 then another letter to say no , sorry , your monthly_payments will remain £_00 . 00 .
M	peter
F	thankyou for delivering a wonderful boquet to an elderly friend very dear to me .
M	the guy couldn_'_t help me and told me i needed to return to the booth when i came back for my car and haven ticket validated .
F	banner was completed in a fast turn - around time , even_though i thought amendments would be needed once submitted ; and we received it earlier_than advised .
F	the first page was daunting but i did work it out reasonably quickly .
M	this is a rubbish service unless you love adverts and don_'_t want to watch any programs .
F	!
F	helped to secure parking too
M	ever .
M	i have reported this by email , but they do not bother to reply .
F	thank_you .
F	the order arrived within 0_days and the couriers did have to come_back a second day to re - deliver .

M	[_name_] is the name of the officer who in charge of my email .
F	i am expecting them to fall_off any time now ( i got them on thursday_evening ).
F	four days_later i have received no call back .
M	it has a premium_rate number for after sales which just seems like a scam .
F	the next_day i sent yet again another email to be told that they had been out of the office the previous day and hadn_'_t come in until late the day after that .
F	the screws don_'_t hold it tight , it falls open and i therefore have had to used insulation tape to seal the box .
M	do not as it will be your customers that suffer and you will lose customers .
F	have used tyre_shopper many_times in the past and always reccomend them .
F	i '_m extremely upset about the mother '_s day bouquet that was delivered to my elderly_mother 0_days before mothers_day . not on the day as i had requested . the bouquet was a disgrace . looked like it had been thrown together .
F	stay away from this company .
F	i try not to shop too much at tesco because i don_'_t like their domination .
M	but it took nearly 0_weeks for my cheque to arrive !
F	plus , you get can free delivery if you order enough .
F	fabulous service !
F	thanks !
M	strings_direct provides such a good service that most high_street music_shops don_'_t bother to stock anything but the most basic brands , and that '_s no good for me .
F	the product arrived quickly and was a good price .
F	they want a photocopy of your passport , a letter with your name and address on and a photo copy of debit_card with the numbers crossed out except for the last 0 or 0 digits .
M	you already have the tracking_number and have admitted losing the item .
F	products do exactly as_described

M	part checked located and purchased through parts_gateway .

M	i '_m still_waiting for any sort of refund .

F	00 day in the life of a small kitten is a very long time .
M	not only did the search_engine work quickly and took me straight to the brandy i was after , but the entire_process was quick and pain_free .
F	brilliant service and superb speedy delivery

M	!

M	lots of useful vpn tips on their site too .
F	my booking was for the short_stay car_park upgrades from long_stay .
M	after writing a few more angry messages and promising to never use / buy steelseries again they sent me a better keyboard than the model i had .
F	disappointed as the flowers arrived at 0 . 00_pm at night .
F	i ordered 0 pairs of neoprene shorts ( 0 . 0 mm and 0 . 0 mm ) in size youth .
F	orders are dealt_with swiftly and accurately and the on - line news_letters are always attractive and interesting .
F	using multiple devices connected to the internet is slow to the point of being almost unusable .
M	i would very happily_recommend cryo pc .
F	this experience - rescheduled online for saturday delivery .
F	all in all though it is a good competitive site to buy from .
F	a few_weeks_later the shoes were returned to me , no letter stating why , i had to phone littlewoods again , i was told that i had to proof there was a fault within the shoe myself and that i had to get in touch with adidas , now the way i see it is that i purchased the shoe from littlewoods and it should have been up them to find the fault , according to the sales of goods_act , this should have been the case .
F	well , i brought 0 lady_gaga tickets for stade de france in april of this year .
M	i feel ashamed to have used this company now i have seen these other reviews .
M	also , with the amount of times purchasing from them and the actual amount spent on their site it would make it much more_appealing to buy from them again if there was some kind of rewards_scheme like money off next order vouchers etc .
M	wonderful service , couldn_'_t be better .
M	this is a poor quality product not worth the £ 0 - 00 delivery charge !
M	excellent packaging , excellent product .
F	i was not very happy about it , and also told them that they were charging a premium for this service !
M	sent away to stockport for a philips mp0_player .
M	only advice i would give to serenata . rethink the delivery company .
F	she assured me the flowers would be deliverd the next_morning .
F	i bought the christmas festive basket and sympathy flower_basket , i upgraded both to the medium_size , both costing_£_00 . 00 plus delivery .
F	the meals were either bland or had too much sauce , making them runny .
M	usually they deliver as prom , ised .
M	that said the car was superb , very clean and comfortable and perfectly served our requirements .
M	true to their word , the sign was received exactly on time , of excellent quality and at a very fair price .
F	the order arrived on time , as quoted ( which was very quick ), and the goods were correct .
M	on erecting the shed it turned_out that both side_panels where not correct_size which meant the windows would not fit .
M	and it has to be sent to switzerland , so i would definitely recommend pharmacy0u to everyone !
F	i am very dissapointed and will never buy from them again in fear of not liking the product .
M	i would ensure that none of friends use this company !
M	on 0 june i purchased 00 tickets from viagogo for a concert at somerset house on 00 july for a total_cost of £_000 . 00 .
M	your answers to my complaints have shown just how much attention you really do pay .
F	this means i had to get up early , although i '_d had a very late night , in order to come downstairs , switch on the computer , get through to my emails , in order in this case to find the carrier was not coming till lunchtime !
F	prices and rapid_despatch are extremely good , this company are very reliable and competitive .
F	i have edited this as chemist_direct have contacted me and offered to refund my postage without me having to complain .
F	however the website is difficult to use and needs updating .
F	fast delivery .
M	amazed at how small and mean these looked .
M	i wouldn_'_t use them again on principal .
F	r . chapelier
F	!
M	full of spoofs , you never know who is real and who is fake !
F	received an_email at 00 . 00_hours the night before advising that my order delivery date had been changed .
F	i was informed however that an arrangement from the local_florist to my grandmother '_s address were willing to provide a bouquet with the same colours as my original order , although the flowers would be with different .
M	true / false ?
F	web_site easy to use , good price and keys arrived promptly and safely .
F	sorry
M	searched the web and found mazuma to sell my iphone .
F	the flowers were not delivered .
F	very impressed with the ease of bank transfers , the updating e_-_mails from currency_club letting_me know exactly_what stage the transaction had reached , and the next_day special delivery of the currency to my home .
F	not impressed with golden_tours .
F	the ' discounts ' i saw , of approximately_£ 0 - 0 . 00 on some bottles , makes you wonder_why they bother but it all helps by the time you pay for delivery .
M	been using ebay for years and never had any_problems , highly_recommend this site :)
F	it was like this all day .
F	i would not look to order anything_else online from homebase , an order should not be accepted and payment taken if you are not able to fulfil what is offered .
M	ordered on a sunday and got it by the tuesday , which was 0 days earlier_than they estimated .
M	if you like to keep to the same stuff all the time then ok , but the variety is very minimal on the food side .
F	given that i live in australia and returning and reordering the tights would cost me extra in the long run , i decided just to try these tights .
M	that said the sea front area is lovely , although the stoney beach is not ideal for young_kids .
F	i would definitely recommend jules_b to my friends .
F	she tried to fob me off saying the flowers may have been left with a neighbour .
F	the flowers were ordered were for mothers_day and we got asked to requested a preferred day of delivery , we requested sunday as this was mothers_day , they arrived on saturday_afternoon .
M	the plug that was broken was also the wrong type for the towbar fitting kit . rang up and explained my situation and had the impresion that this couldnt be so but decided to send me another plug .
M	note all the recent negative_reviews have been reported and removed
F	very poor even for a budget room .
M	i am now looking for an_alternative courier agent , hopefully with better prices .
F	annoying as i will now need to buy a third darker pair !
M	well that '_s where the communication stopped .
M	very clever , i '_ll be sure to warn my friends not to bother
M	hopefully my girlfriend will be as impressed as i am .
M	!
F	on the 0rd day i got an apologetic email_informing_me that they were now dispatching my item ( what was going on for 00 days ?
M	nothing more to add
M	called to ask for help to be told nothing we can do .
M	great product at the best price i could_find .
M	placed an order friday_morning , by friday_afternoon i got a message_saying that my order had been processed and was being dispatched .
M	no reply .
M	flowers bought for valentines .
F	as it is now two_weeks since i ordered with the " next_day delivery " i have said yes , fine , i '_ll have a refund and will go back to amazon where they are more_expensive but at_least you know it '_ll arrive !
F	westin are so far unwilling to take any responsibility for their delivery and so we have wasted money on rancid meat .
F	the cost of transfers from dusseldorf to cologne hiked_up the cost considerably .
F	very pleased with my item , great service and delivery was brilliant , service was helpful and everything was on time .
F	to be fair , optimalprint were speedy in their response and re - sent my order to be which i received a day or two later and they were lovely .
M	after waiting all day for delivery i get an email saturday_evening saying that the order had to be cancelled as they couldn_'_t find a florist to fulfill the order .
F	in the end we had to wait over 0_weeks for delivery , with mytub '_s suggested solution being that we shoiuld pay the extra delivery charge for quicker delivery anyway !
M	the area manager is even worse .
F	the tallboy i ordered was going to take 00 - 00 weeks to be delivered .
F	first_class delivery and you can actually see what you are buying !
M	nice flowers delivered very fast .
F	however , i was disappointed about the complete_lack of quality control in this company .
F	you have been warned beware !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
F	had a look for one thing and came away with two without too much damage to my purse .
M	they did turn_up at 00 . 00 one morning , blocking my cul - de - sac , and , after a twenty minute ' perusal ' of paperwork , and a search of the van , told me they did not have ' my product ' ( a washing_machine ! )
F	we booked couples holiday insurance for usa and found that it was a great deal .
F	i was hoping that the call_centre agent would be able to tell me what sort of time ( morning or afternoon ) so that i can pop out before / or after the collection .
F	well maybe not so cheap if you don_'_t actually get any shoes after_spending over_£_00 .
M	seems a nice product , with quick delivery
M	i '_m_sure the lights worked properly before i entered the garage , and i had to adjust the handbrake when i came back home because it was very tight ( this year didn_’_t have any problem with it ).
F	the engineer came on the 00th and said the boiler needed a part which they did not have in stock so needed ordering .
F	it seems that asos don_'_t understand that losing a days work either loses myself or my employer money , and thus means i cannot stay in all day waiting for a failed attempt to collect the item .
F	this is my experience i have gave them the chance to rectify but heard_nothing .
F	i really suspect if there '_s a real employee working on this part !
F	after_speaking to customer service i had to send the empty box back and order a replacement .
F	fantastic service , i would definatly use escapade again .
F	speedy service , however i had to pay the £ 0 . 00 postage plus an admin_fee of £ 0 . 00 to the post_office , as no postage had been put on the envelope .
M	i would really recommend going else where - they may be cheap , but not worth it .
M	i ordered this product late one evening at it was on my doorstep within 00_hours .
F	!
F	by the time i had chosen my supplier , i found that booking charge made this slightly more_expensive than other search_engine i viewed but i carried on as i couldn_'_t be bothered starting all over again .
F	quick online valuation and easy process , but we dropped the phones in on wednesday and didn_'_t receive payment until the following_monday - not within the 00_hours as promised .
M	i ordered some cans of soda . one of them was broken , possibly due to poor wrapping . not a big deal , but if you order 00 cans you expect to receive 00 cans , not 00 .
F	the web_site was excellent for creating this , and i was even contacted directly to iron out a possible problem with the final printing .
M	my compliant and opinions are contained in my 0 / 0 / 00 letter to country_attire ltd . their service was not satisfactory to me .
M	thought it funny when i was only charged £_00 , thinking i ' d been given a deal .
F	great curtains .
F	although i got my goods in good time , the whole site wasn_'_t ipad friendly with many of the features unresponsive , a frustrating experience to an other wise good site .
F	so not certain what to do next .
F	i found it very confusing to know what exactly i was buying and i called for further support and didn_'_t get a straight answer either .
F	great affordable_prices .
M	i was told the strings would arrive to the shop on a tuesday and then they would be sent to me .
F	unplugged my old one and left it standing in the middle of the room .
M	sigma_sports delivered very quickly with as good a price for the assos bibshots as i could_find !
M	much later in the day i received an email from her saying the same stuff with which she and her colleagues had tried to fob me off .
M	good product , swiftly delivered
F	it is irelavant what the manufacturer says because they may be happy to produce this kind of quality as acceptable .
M	admin and delivery perfect .
F	the product arrived exactly when specified and was just how it was described online .
M	my gut tells_me trustpilot cannot be trusted .
M	they did offer to send it back for free .
M	but now i only have $_000 i call again and ask where is the rest and was told it was lost in conversion i ask if i can speak to the manager but that did nt really help they would nt admit it was there mistake and would give me any money back what a joke
F	i purchased a few products one which was a fake_tan mit and i did not realise it was only a face one as it didnt state it clearly and it was around 0 / 0 pounds and they are only € 0 to buy in shops for the big ones , i wasn_'_t happy with thatc
M	if the opus 0 door has the same sized back then all the supplying of measurements is pointless .
M	excellent service and the plane is satisfactory although there are minor problems .
M	they said it would be dispatched within_00hrs ; it wasn_'_t .
M	i '_ve bought 0 costumes from joker '_s - the first was a female oktoberfest outfit which was falling_apart after one day wearing it , i tried to wash it and it ended_up staining half my clothes because the colour ran .
M	all worked_seamlessly with the tyres being delivered , ready for fitting when i arrived .
F	wont answer emails , worst shopping_experience ever !
F	that said i would recommend this site .
F	this is not_necessarily precious_little one '_s fault , but they have not tried to rectify the situation - they merely asked city_link to redeliver , which is what city_link appear to have been doing , but no delivery attempts were made .
M	having looked aound and decided the model i needed was the lexmark_x000 , printerland had the cheapest offer up to 00_% lower_than some others .
F	i received an arrangement heavy on the gerberas and carnations in bright_pink , lime and white .
M	phoned up and was told that bike was not ready and that it should have said that bikes take longer as they needed to swap round brakes ( this was not on website ).
F	one other tyre_shopper customer arrived shortly_after me - he was less_than impressed too .
F	i found this site really helpful , the prices are competitive and the delivery is fast .
M	cheapest price and free next_day delivery .
M	00_mins later i called back but they had no record of my earlier call and no message had been sent to the driver .
M	i caught the delivery man peeing in front_door of flars 0 ! weeks before and i was upset with him for that , he started , to abuse me instead for saying sorry , i wrote to the company about this issue got no reply and no action was taken
F	devastated , because i couldn_'_t possibly take my bf to a holiday_inn for his_birthday [ hardly romantic ] i rung them up the second i got the email which would mean that the booking was still being_processed .
F	it looked like i would get the the sunglasses in 0 - 0_days and i was due to go on holiday 00 days_later .
M	fussy , cluttered website .
M	great service !!
M	i did speak to chris baker the area manager , but he was unhelpful , failed to take_responsibility and also failed to call back .
M	courier given access to a block of private flats , customer appears not to be in , does not leave card but does decides to ( fraudulently ) sign for it himself and then leaves it somewhere - parcel goes missing .
F	found this website that offered more than just flowers to be delivered , ordered what i thought would be a special gift of flowers , mini_balloon and birthday_cake .
F	two items were broken when they arrived .
F	your website did not explain the mailing_bags sufficiently enough for me to realise they were very cheap quality .
M	the premium pricing therefore no_longer translates to a better quality of service , unlike it did at the time when we first joined all those years_ago .
M	i am_currently owed around £ 0 , 000 built up over a long period and they are refusing to pay out !
M	they asked me if i wanted to add bt_vision , i said " no , i am trying to save_money , not add it !"
M	from placing an order to receiving the goods , every_step is monitored and i was kept_appraised of every detail .
F	i purchase a lost of goods online and i must_say this is the worst customer service i have ever had .
F	had three_separate_deliveries , with no prior e_- mail to advise dispatch for 0 order .
F	00 / 00
F	he was in when the surprise arrived and was thrilled to bits with his present .
F	i ordered my dress from vponsale on the 00th_september , and it actually arrived today .
M	cheers , simon
M	i ordered two beech work_tops from worktop_express and everything from ordering the worktops to their delivery and quality has_been amazing .
F	i cannot_fault the service .
M	regards
M	very quick service and delivery . would use again .
F	would i use this company again ?
M	if i were to do this again i ' d ensure i called and advised the garage of the order and again call them on the day to ensure availability when i arrived .
F	it is one of the few places that sell arden_grange salmon for dogs .
M	something that i think should be reconsidered to retain customer loyalty .
M	i think we all felt a little bored by the time we reached bath .
M	prompt service .
F	i guess i am too used to shopping with the likes of john_lewis , topshop and asos etc where the order process is swift and efficient .
F	fast delivery .
F	i was very pleased with the service , you know exactly_what you are going to get paid , and it is all done very quickly .
M	i ordered flowers for my wife as i had to be away on our_anniversary .
F	finally i was seeing the light at the end of this rather stressful period , until today ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) over 0_months after my first contact with talktalk i receive and email_telling_me my april bill is ready to be viewed , and this is where i get the biggest shock the bill is a total of £_000 . 00 - listing contract breakage fee charges of £_000 . 00 + youview + box deferred fee of £_000 , so their promises of voiding all charges was clearly yet again another lie and not once did they ask for a return of the youview_box , nevertheless they will not on any circumstances be receiving another penny from me as i have cancelled the direct_debit , and i refuse to pay for their mistakes and lies .
F	the hoodie was perfect for a size 00 on the top half .
F	the photobook we received was really good but the 0st time i tried to upload the photos i got an_error_message and didn_'_t know if the order had been processed .
M	received faulty goods so had to return .
F	on my invoice it states children '_s large headless_horseman and you sent me an adults large costume .
M	i needed a usb pen and needed it quick .
M	other_suppliers do not do this , and offer a cheaper option when purchasing multi items .
M	they are well made and comfortable .
F	deal was good value with a weeks carparking at airport .
F	i was kept well informed by the carrier and they delivered when the said they would .
F	we are looking_forward to spending many happy years together .
M	have to buy more .
M	bertie , ta for your comment .
F	i thought the delivery service would be first_class , but i placed order last_week and i still_haven_'_t received my order
F	the contact_lenses were a good price but there was a small problem with the order which_meant it took a while to arrive .
F	this company is a joke , go elsewhere .
M	bought a base for £_00 and was sent the wrong base emailed with no reply back
M	i thought i wouldn_'_t hear_anything for weeks however after a few_days they were delivered !
F	i did not bother ringing them back after that .
M	however , tons were full of apologies and rearranged delivery promptly , spot on and cheap !
F	otherwise i would of had them .
M	he also stated that he ' d be adding a further aspect to their test plans to ensure such defects would be captured in the future - its great to see a company learn from an_oversight to ensure it won_'_t happen again .
M	very good service , had tracker to watch and track the delivery , only down_side , was they wasn_'_t the flowers i ordered via the internet
M	the goods were well_packed and delivered within a few_days of being ordered .
F	if they do read these , i would hope they have the decency to reimburse money they owe to customers .
M	not the same shade of white , not the same manufacturer and not even exactly the same size .
M	well_done keep_up the good work .
F	very quick delivery by pleasant , polite young_men .
F	the sky '_s the limit when it comes to jackpots
M	jeg_bestilte_en_pakke med hjælp fra shopusa og_det_hele gik fint , indtil de sendte pakken fra deres terminal . pakken er nu væk på 0 uge og_efter 0 - 0 mails hører jeg_ikke fra dem , og_kan_ikke få fat på dem på hverken mail eller telefon .
M	photobook was ok . not bad .
F	the ch soon nip that in the bud though !!
M	this went_smoothly .
F	will never deal with this company again and will encourage all those i know to do the same .
F	smaller one is great .
M	it was efficiently and professionally resolved , however this is a very basic issue which should have been picked_up at the quality control stage .
M	i only notices when going to cut the grass .
M	but returns cost me £ 0 to ship back item + £ 0 . 00 deducted from refund to cover their shipping charges .
F	shopping with saa is a very pleasureable experience with all your requirements in one catalogue .
M	do not touch this company .
F	but i had not eaten at dover because i was looking_forward to a nice leisurely meal served to me on the top_deck .
M	i haven_'_t had to return anything yet so i can '_t comment on their customer service .
F	i sold a few books and got a good sum of money .
M	and to date they have been fantastic ( quick )
M	more emails sent , eventually i got a refund for one of the packages , i don_'_t know which one , they were both the same price .
M	i had ordered a new galaxy_s0 three_days ago , no phone as yet , i have e_mailed them on 0 occasions no reply , i tried_phoning the 0000 number , on hold for 00_minutes no reply .
M	i '_m dubious because in my entire life nothing i have ever sent by post has not arrived .
F	i can '_t recommend them highly_enough .
M	i received my items speedily enough unfortunately the bow_ties were extremely poor quality and one arrived dirty .
M	nothing gives it away more that you are using an answering service than when the operator answering the phone cannot pronounce your company name when answering your phone .
M	they claimed to have sent a commode that was not sent and was not available .
F	great food , and choice will reccommend
F	myukdelivery failed to collect my item on 0 separate_occasions .
F	efficient service .
M	you couldn_'_t make it up .
M	everything completed but confirming payment returned me to home page . customer service wanted to charge £_00 extra for same ticket which i eventually bought for £ 0 extra the next_day .
F	i swear you can get just about anything on amazon :_d
F	receipts , reservation numbers , actual tickets , probably some shakin ' steven '_s concert_tickets in there as well .
M	their adverts currently state " we '_ll buy every car " and going by the standard they '_ll sell you any as well , even if it '_s clearly full of faults , as by the time you notice somethign isn_'_t right it '_s too late .
F	the service was fast from sending my phones through the post to receiving my chq .
F	eflorist may be slightly cheaper but this seems to negatively impact their customer service which in my opinion is not worth the saving , especially given the time you will spend trying to obtain a satisfactory response !
M	on every contact i receive an excuse ( but no appology ) and a promise to process the refund that same day , but it never happens .
M	they did not deliver on the promised day , even_though i had paid for next - day delivery .
F	my further animal_needs will be through you , as i am a very happy customer
M	i now have to got out and buy the film from a local_supermarket to prevent my daughter '_s upset .
M	waited another 00mins , by this time there was 00 staff all standing around looking gormless .
F	i purchased a couple of bamboo '_s from here a couple of years_ago , i went to this company because they sell such a wide_range of bamboo plants .
F	the tracking page was incomprehensible and all i could i make out was that a notice of attempted delivery had been put through my door and the parcel no_longer needed to be signed for .
M	the refund was finally given on friday 00th_may .
F	then dx rattan_direct '_s courier " lost " my sun_loungers .
F	the flowers ordered were exactly as shown on the website and , as they weren_'_t for me i was emailed at every_step of their journey with sweet messages , perfect
F	appalling charge for using debit_cards by the time all the charges you incur fling schedule with ba ect is not much more exspensive when you consider your costs for travel on to your flight to get you to yuor destination oout of the way airports used
F	i dont trust this site used them before when my account was closed i kept getting emails_telling my i owe them money which i never did my account was clear this went one for a while so i stay well clear
M	once the books had arrived it did take some time to process them although to be fair there were a lot of them .
F	on holiday itself we had a fantastic time .
M	my follow_up email to their head_office was totally_ignored too .
F	very pleased with order for 00th_wedding_anniversary .
M	slight_glitch with my order , which was sorted_out quickly and efficiently by farnham_cycles customer_support .
M	on first inspection all seemed ok , naturally i wanted to plug it in .
F	some articles were out of stock at time of delivery , but i was refunded rapidly .
F	the service was excellent .
F	another negative is the fact that the voucher they send is only valid for a week from the date they send it out .
F	good quality products , items received really quickly
F	would recommend go_electrical to my friends .
F	i complained to customer service who said they '_ll ask their couriers to be more careful in future !
M	i payed £_00 for a strimmer to get collected on friday between 0 and 0 , no collection made so i got in touch with parcel_monkey who said sorry andwould get intouch with them to arrange_collection on the monday ,,,, guess_what !
F	for a customer who has_been used to ordering 0 kilos , this is not only an annoyance , but very expensive .
M	they are also spectacularly expensive for a poor service .
F	my umbrella holder was dispatched and delivered so quickly , i was kept well informed and got the feeling that my custom was valued , i '_d fully recommend !
M	really pleased with my purchase and would use again in the future
F	i have never written a review for anything before but i honestly am so pleased with my service and product .
M	the box was rather distressed having been sent in just a plastic_envelope without_any padding , but the product is fine .
F	listing id_:_00000000
F	it was and the quality was good .
F	so i went online to rearrange delivery the next_day to my neighbours but apparently kitty litter requires the signature of the addressee only .
F	we found the sevice top_dollar . never ordered online before , was worried but products plus staff fantastic
F	however on return from a lovely holiday i was met with rudeness that turned into a very horrible situation where i felt intimidated and vulnerable .
M	checking the tracking status it showed the item may have been damaged in transit and to contact citylink .
F	being metal , the angles need to be pretty precise , but once they are in the tightening etc is a doddle .
F	dell periodically email us to tell us they are ‘ expediting ’ this matter .
F	i let it drop as i was just very grateful for the twine which i couldn_'_t find locally - but it did sour my view of their systems .
F	they told us it had been dispatched to their courier ( yodel ) & was stuck somewhere with them but they couldnt get in touch with them so there was nothing they could do & they refused to re - imburse any money until they had located the bike !
F	none the less , i am a very satisfied_customer and i will definitely be ordering again in the near_future .
M	they are fabulous - look great , comfortable , light_weight and exectkly the right size ( thanks to the measuring instructions ).
F	the ordering process could not have been simpler and the delivery and the correspondence around the delivery was excellent .
M	polite and friendly staff .
F	first time we have come_across your company and i would say it was a very good experience .
F	lovely hamper although the box arrived sobbing wet and broken .
M	who knew .
F	ordered a shirt from my son which arrived with the wrong number on , spoke to an advisor who promised me a new shirt would be printed the next_day & couriered overnight .
M	easy to find what i wanted and easy to pay .
M	very amateur website that doesn_'_t work and gives misleading information that only serves to make them more in charges and interest by cheating the customers .
F	please_note i would have complained and asked for a replacement however this was a last_minute christmas_present so out of time .
F	only had a small order but it arrived as ordered and all good .
F	i have called and emailed which just resulted_in being_fobbed_off with excuses and assurances that my order was being dispatched immediately .
F	the man was very polite .
F	.
M	very friendly great service . will order again .
M	perhaps it is , but if so something went badly wrong , since for quite a few_days it was saying " in stock " when it wasn_'_t .
F	ive since sent it to them via_email 0 times yet you refuse to post my review .
M	i wouldn_'_t say it is very uncomfortable - i sleep in many hotels that are much worse , but at the same time i do sleep in other hotel beds that are better .
M	so my message is , god help you if a purchase goes_wrong !!!
F	my question being was there essays and a final exam .
F	by then it was too late for me to get someone_else .
F	easily to process and a quick response and payment
M	if you know nothing about what to looking for you can easly choose wrong one !
M	delivery on day specified .
F	excellent choice of product and great prices - what more can i say ???
M	complete_joke
M	mine '_s not still ( 0 - 0 ).
F	we had intended to order my fiance '_s ring that day too but after this experience we actually went to another jewellers who managed to make his ring on time and perfectly .
M	dispatch was fast with quick tracked delivery .
F	and just issued a refund instead .
M	bought a pair of thin sealskinz for fell running .
M	excellent service .
F	will definitely use this site again .
F	the item itself was very good value for money .
F	i sold my mobile on mazuma .
F	delivery as expected .
F	very very disappointed .
M	had the best transaction with bulk_powders .
M	ana from the customer_satisfaction team was very helpful .
F	the orders arrive quickly and neatly , the site is easy to navigate and the prices are really competitive .
M	if your priority is cost and you are prepared for a long wait for your goods then they may be the suppplier for you .
F	after i got home from holiday , they had still not arrived and i started to think that this was a scam , especially as i saw some online reviews starting that the company was a scam and i remembered my bank hadn_'_t authorised the transaction .
F	update on reply : i '_ve now had an_email_telling_me that distance_selling act doesn_'_t apply to me " the 0 day money back guarantee does not apply in this instance as you have not received the item ."
M	in the meantime i am informed that my booking was cancelled and that i am not due any refund .
F	the roses were of good quality but it was not of the size of the bunch of flowers in the picture .
M	recommended to all .
M	ordered a samsung phone , order accepted but remained at that status for ages , then order being prepared for ages .
M	my expensive microwave arrived with a small_dent in the door - very quick and easy to return .
F	waste of time .
F	went to the peel centre toysrus after reserving toys online which i found helpful , however when i went to the customer service desk to pick_up the goods the staff were as miserable as sin !!
M	order was prepared and delivered within an excellent time frame
F	since the 0_months of posting this , no word from infurn and certainly no money ( it should be noted groupon have been great and have had a been bag delivered through another company ) .
F	it failed to meet the purpose it was purchased for and therefore is no_longer required .
F	i '_m_sure this will be addressed at some time but it '_s a bit of a pain and needs some joined up thinking .
F	i wouldn_'_t recommend xln , despite my long previous history , i don_'_t know_whats changed with them of late but they are now appauling !
M	she clearly had no idea about the locations and offered no help at all other than giving another premium_rate number to call .
F	that was until today when ashley was able to sort_out my refund giving me a number of payment options .
M	very good .
F	wrapping of some items were not very good .
M	please do some further research on your pods and try to match n '_s more closely .
M	very good , detailed and easily_understood .
F	can only_assume it was a faulty batch in " the west_end " colour .
F	!
M	the next_day the guitar arrived within the allotted hour i was told it would do so .
M	the site has a huge_selection of all types of pens so its the best site to go to if you are looking for a pen .
F	some of the reatilers offer you good cashback and then dispute it and don_'_t pay it so it is a risk you take as this has happend to me 0 times with different vehicle insurance companies
F	i ordered a canon_camera which was " in stock ", was told thre was a slight_delay with processing the order even_though i had paid for next_day delivery .
F	having said all that , we are very satisfied with the goods , we would used nets 0 go again , but would suggest that there is more contact with the customer , when problems_arise , i would have gladly waited for the order , had i known there was some sort of problem , its was the not knowing that created problems .
M	i bought a tow_bar .
M	definitely not worth the money i spent , i probably could have got a better quality item for a better price some where else .
F	they did not have the base_layer top in any of the stores that i checked at .
M	unfortunately when the item came there were 0 parts missing !
M	would recommend to anyone who needs a reliable supplier of contact_lenses
M	it took another hour and a half of waiting before the job was finally complete - three hours of my weekend that i won_'_t get back !
F	luckily nothing was missing , but better packaging would make a huge_difference .
M	hi i recently formed a company on behalf of a client using ukplc . com .
F	a very professional team .
F	we would not have minded if we had a phone_call to warn us or apologise or if we had been told we may have to wait all day , but there was no call , no apology and they did not care .
F	the milk jug was as ordered , but let '_s face it there cannot be much to be wrong with just a jug !
F	as i wanted the item quickly i chose their express delivery at an extra £ 0 . 00 .
F	excellent service that i would recommend to anyone .
F	the guarantee was invalid and i was expected to pay a massively inflated amount for this warranty which would not have been valid if i had tried to use it due to a number of reasons .
F	this did not upset our day but if these colours were not available it would have been nice to know before hand .
F	would recommend this company for effeciency .
F	i feel m & s is a trustworthy store who do care about customer service .
F	no thanks to victoria_plumb .
F	however , i did not send my back because i realised i would be getting a replacement piece exactly the same and i have been unable to find anything that matches the measurements i needed except the items i bought so would not be able to find anything elsewhere either .
M	i then get an email_saying that my order was going to be shipped ( a good week_later ) but although the initial item that was out of stock was now available one of my other items was now out !
F	ordered a mattress and they phoned to arrange a date for delivery .
M	i begrudge even giving them one star !
F	very please with the trainers .
M	the car was first_class , very clean and economical .
M	when ordering was told it would be 0st april . then phoned and told no sooner_than 0th
F	how many delivery people do they have ?
F	i can guarantee that all the older folk don_'_t appreciate screeching music blasting at them .
F	great website and company .
F	.
M	i strongly_suggest anyone considering buying from wae research previous feedback on a number of review and financial websites .
M	i was very impressed to receive my goods the day after_placing my order .
F	!
M	however pick_up was appalling - it took nearly as long to get the vehicle as it did to fly from the uk to majorca - literally .
F	dont don_'_t waste your time going through to checkout with purchases if you don_'_t live in england as delivery will cost you .
M	having looked through many tyre websites was very pleased to find tyre_shopper .
F	i have been contacted by my very unhappy customer that he has not received his parcel today and when looking at the tracking , he will not get it until monday .
F	has it been sent ?
F	brilliant !
M	some replied , some didn_'_t .
F	a definite five_star service - i could get addicted to buying shoes from shoetique !
F	loved the range of cards , but they put the wrong age on the one chosen so aged my sister by years which wasn_'_t appreciated .
M	confirmation of saturday delivery received electronically the following wednesday !
F	!
F	looks like we went to the wrong retail_park as everyone else has had a good experience .
M	other then that ok
F	my comments are currently being reviewed by serenata .
M	medals are lovely but the engraving doesn_'_t stand out at all
M	i recieved some payment in us dollor approx 000 i call them up and ask them if i can transfer they money into my us dollor bank_account as dollor because paypal rate was very bad so i told them transfer they money into my bank and let them do the conversion .
F	thankfully my dress is 000_% perfect !
F	i then get told by hayley it would be paid in my bank as soon as finance guy ( kumar ) comes in to the office , at 0 . 00pm , still no refund .
M	hi i just received the sunglasses the oakley five squared and i was suprised by the size of it . the one size in the internet page i think is not right .
F	this was a christmas center piece which was useless after the holidays .
F	there was one item missing , so i phoned up and the lady seemed very helpful and said she would send the missing item on that day , i also asked about the postage .
F	works well , no setup required and easy to read .
M	contact trustpilot ?
F	the price was right and i received my shower_head the very next_day .
F	warning if you want your products on time do not order from this company .
M	will_definitely be checking here 0st next time .
M	what disapointed me for my last visit was that i was willing to spend money for some minx speakers and an av_receiver .
F	do not buy anything off this company , once they have your money they wash their hands of you , ordered a fitted kitchen from them , free delivery , they couldn_'_t give me a time so i had to take a day off work , they came after i should have finished work so i lost a days pay for nothing , then an extremely rude little man dumped everything by my front_door and said they were only paid to deliver that far , i am a 00 year_old lady , i had to drag all the boxes in myself , i am_disgusted with b_& q thus is not customer service , i phoned them and they said it was the delivery firms fault and out of their hands , shame on you , avoid this firm at all costs !
M	i received an email this morning telling_me my parcel would be delivered between 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 and at 00 : 00 it arrived .
M	happy with service from tile_mountain but courier company did not phone 00_mins before despite having it written in front of them on their paper !
F	thank_you .
F	used hotline for a number of years_now and always pleased with the delivery
F	i was also very surprised at how small the bunch was .
M	rac pass you onto these muppets if there is a crash and a blame !!
M	i was away for two week in mexico since the purchase !!
M	i would recommend 000_% .
F	however , seem to have a good range of corner shops that you can return to .
F	again i explained the situation and again the reasons we did not want the package and asked him why we couldn_'_t return the tv box under the distance_selling rules or under the 00 day cooling_off period .
F	placing the order for the flowers was straightforward and i was then very pleased with the amount of feedback , right down to the message to say the flowers had been left , as instructed , in a safe_place at the recipients ' house ( they were out ).
F	unfortunately when you order something you have no choice over the courier company used , but this makes the rabbit hutch company look very bad .
F	i can always save money and find what i need and want .
F	the blackcircles website was easy and fast to use ( especially as i didn_'_t want to go outdoors to check my tyre size ) and gave_me the best prices around .
F	brilliant i thought , suddenly the frames i thought were out of my price range were affordable so i promptly ordered another home_trial to check the frames i wanted and placed an order .
M	i totally messed_up my order online ; then i bought the wrong bag ( which they let_me have even_though it was £_00 more than the one i had originally ordered .)
M	frustrating !
M	i sent an email pointing_out the error .
F	i bought a pair of union_jack leggings which looked great on the model and at a total of £_00 inc_vat & delivery , i expected them to be of good quality .
F	other than that its fantastic , its great quality and looks like a lot of care went into making it .
M	i would certainly recommend bablas for prompt and efficient service .
M	my credit_card company had to charge me £ 0 . 00 .
M	well what can i say ,
F	i was really impressed by the quick delivery of my fitflops .
F	return transfer in mallorca didn_'_t turn_up but after persistent emails to resorthoppa customer_services we were given a refund for the taxi_fare we had to pay for to get to the airport on time .
F	!
M	i asked to speak to the manager and complained .
M	however - worth to check for offers .
M	having said that the furniture arrived in perfect_condition .
F	at 00 . 00pm i received an_email from xdp saying ' it wont_be out today , i have not received any freight for delivery today .
M	this is a complete no_brainer .
F	my god was he right , this is the only way to order your meat . i will give you there email address .
M	pay_pal have advised me not to drop this dispute or i will lose their protection and that pixmania have to contact paypal , but pixmania are adamant not to contact paypal but maintain their stance of me dropping the dispute .
F	delivered between ( typically !)
F	it actually made me laugh .
F	eventually spoke to customer_services who informed me they were very sorry , would email warehouse .
M	as someone_who has made several orders through affordable_supplements ’ website in the past i have always been satisfied with their service .
F	full_marks !
F	everything was very well_organised , we followed all of their advise and were 000_% satisfied .
F	package was sent in a plain package so if you need something discrete ( family . etc .), that '_s a good thing .
F	easy to use site , loads of products at competitive_prices , goods were very well_packaged and delivery was fast .
F	i ordered thank u cards for baby presents i had received for my daughter , the choice of designs were great and the system to order was very easy to use .
F	will never ever use or recommend them again .
F	we found the web_site very informative which made ordering the underfloor_heating easy to do .
M	therefore i would recommend shopping around if you are looking to transfer money , but not_necessarily avoiding cs .
F	if you want art equipment at an extremely competitive_prices join the saa .
F	i wanted to send the book to france but the company could not accomodate this .

M	' never again '
F	my sister sent me a picture of the flowers as they looked so poor .
F	i would love if you could create a gluten_free suet dumpling to have with homemade stews , gf desserts like the old sara lee doubke chocolate gateaux and a gf battered fish , chips & mushy peas ready_meal !
F	did have some doubts . was it too good to be true ?
M	highly_recommended .
F	as i said the only_thing i was disappointed with was the postage .
M	but over all not to bad .
F	my next call was 0_days after ordering and was again told it would be sent out that day .
F	she said the deal was the best she '_d ever_seen in her twenty year career ! the hotel was superb and we still_haven_'_t got over what a great deal we got .
M	the heater fan was buzzing occasionally and it had a slight groan on the steering at low speeds so i was going to mention these item too .
F	however , although we were told where to meet the operator upon our return , signs to the relevant car_park at stanstead were not good , and we were waiting in the wrong place .
F	currently have an issue with label for tnt collection which seems to be unavailable to print
M	i wauited 00 days before e amiling a complaint .

F	£_00 . 00 is a lot to pay for delivery still_waiting after almost 0_months on an explanation as to why we are not being refunded for pallet delivery when our bathroom_suite arrived loose in the back of a transit with several items damaged and broken waiting almost 0_months for refund of damaged items but no refund for pallet delivery we did not receive .
M	it '_s a real_shame so many companies choose to use yodel .
F	i never received a reply , so i sent another message using this form - again my message went ignored .
F	my sunglasses arrive in a bashed and dented box , the case has seen better days and i feel very disapointed .
M	so be ware i guess of accepting first offers and own web_site testimonials , give people an honest value at the start and you will get the business is the moral , ps , i took there " improved offer as for the extra £ 0 i would have got from the high_street in the end i could not be_bothered and i guess someone_who has lots of gold would be so its all relevant
F	the parcel was undamaged & came on time .

M	fast reliable service .
M	i '_m in the uk and they sent me an eu dc adapter , and also a uk_plug ( unwired ).

M	if that is the case can one not use them to collect from ?
M	e . g .
F	they cannot handle the simplest hotel booking , and when attempted to correct the errors , you might as well be dealing_with martians .
F	i ordered two photobooks , one each for my sons who are now living_abroad .
F	guess_what - item arrived and i have been charged anyway and now have to arrange a return .
M	seriously .
F	carwow gave_us the opportunity to compare_prices from different audi dealers for the new_audi q0 which we have subsequently bought through carwow .
F	easy to order online .

M	would be better to have a telephone_number to speak to staff re delivery .
F	regards dianne mccormick .
F	but there were problems .
F	i undertand we have had easter and there would be a delay but nearly a month
M	anyway we returned in the week and after 00_minutes this time we were helped out and given a key to view a car .
M	do not fall for the ever so nice website .
F	they were apologetic but it meant a trip into_town to return the unwanted item even_though there was no postage to pay .
M	information re stock_levels seems to be accurate .
F	thankyou for making life so much_easier
F	i have ordered a couple things on animed , and i ordered a prescription of metacam for my dog and had a prescription to say that i could order another bottle .

M	wohoo !
F	once again i tried wiggle for one last time .
F	ordered on sunday_evening , delivered ontuesday .

M	what a great quality service me got from dese people man .
M	apart_from the annoying sales_pitch for the warranty , which is where ao seems to be making approx 00_% of their profits from , i would buy from them again .
M	guitar plays_beautifully now .
M	once i had mastered the effort of finding the imei_numbers from the phone , the whole_process from there was fantastic customer service experience .
F	!
F	no manners and no customer service skills at all !
M	update :- i was contacted by mpd shortly_after leaving this review apologising for the mistake and that the cashback would get paid to me straight_away .
F	i wasted a hole day waiting for the parcel .
F	this was definitely not the case , the item was in stock so should have been dispatched and delivered but has not arrived .
M	you enter the port of departure .
M	really good service with a knowledgeable technician who installed confidence .
F	oh but they will send the mirrored fronts and we can meet the expense of a glazier to replace them .
F	the guitar was delivered on time , there were a few scratches and the box had been dented a lot , but as this was a present it wasn_'_t until some time after we had bought the guitar that we noticed the damage .
F	my son wanted to buy 0ds with his_birthday money , ordered it may_0000 , like others have said , when they eventually answered an_email kept saying would be despatched in 00_hours , never received anything , very quick to take money out of your account , not so quick at answering the telephone .
F	so we ask for email_confirmation .
F	fitted my corsa perfectly .
F	the website is so easy , the pack arrived immediately and i had a cheque within 0_days .
F	i booked 0 nights in " escape hostel " in lagos , and they cancelled my reservation cause they had an inspection and they had to close the hostel .
M	the attitude of transglobal staff is unacceptable and i was given the standard procedure about 0 times !
F	my friend told me about cheap_smells now i would not shop anywhere_else for my beauty products . in one word it '_s fantastic .
F	obviously with a disabled_person the apartment was our only option and this cost us further taxi fees plus €_00 for the day for a less_than nice apartment .
F	things i didnt like .
M	as a tentative internet shopper , i was very comfortable buying items here .
F	they also were sent through the regular postal service , not signed for as indicated on their website .
M	i paid for this and it was just a bunch of links to other_websites .
M	already remarked above .
F	why did the second delivery come from padiham ( miles from preston ) on the wrong day and the wrong order .
M	if pupillary_distance is such an issue why isn_'_t it supplied as part of the prescription an optician supplies ?
F	great payment options
F	i upgraded from small to medium bouquet .
F	i have used halfpriceperfumes for a while , you cannot deny the great value for money , but when i order sane , sensible sunglasses , for sane , sensible ( older ) relatives , ( silver & black , & black / purple ), & being sent bright sickly green for one order , & the brightest blue for the other , is no good for me to give as presents .
M	so be aware sellers , be aware !
M	don_'_t really see much point having a customer service email address if they ' re not reviewing it regularly .
F	!
F	i cannot recommend them highly_enough and it is so refreshing to actually find a company that does exactly_what it says it '_s going to do with no_fuss , many many people and companies could_learn so much from these_guys .
M	this was confirmed the day before delivery was due .
F	however i feel the company who delivered the products could be letting you down .
M	tell people the truth please .
M	speaking with customer_services about these issues at the time i found 0 particular girl so rude and with a terrible ' well that '_s tough and your problem attitude ' i was left speechless .
M	i was very happy with my experience .
F	asos still seem to allow sellers to sell items even_though the response by the customers reflects that the items they are receiving are incorrect and unable to be returned when they have been given no warning about this .
F	my gripe is that i had to return the trainers due to a manufacturing_fault , i completed the form as directed with the codes indicating why i was requesting a replacement and sent them back , i was sent a replacement trainer in a larger_size which i did not request .
M	ordered bbq form ebay may .
M	seems more like they don_'_t care but a major flaw as there name is somewhat marred now .
F	no delivery charge .
M	i purchased this laptop for work - what a bargain !
F	it will be processed asap ', is beyond a joke .
F	the service was very fast - my books seemed to arrive the next_day and an e_- mail was sent to confirm everything was in order . and money appeared in my bank_account !
F	also a special thank_you to alison who kept all our family up to date on facebook - my mum couldn_'_t wait to see your news update each day !
M	part of order was missing , awaiting missing part
F	that just tells_me that it was loaded on the van on 00rd may , so far it looks as though it '_s still in the van !!
M	superb service and excellent range of products .
F	she '_s a credit to the company .
F	the flowers were lovely .
M	i had an email and text to tell me it would be delivered between 00 . 00 & 00 . 00 that day including a tracking_link .
M	i will pursue this further with trading_standards we just want what we paid for or some other solution . be very careful if you are considering purchases from this site , they need to change their claimed 0 reasons to buy to 0 and add customer service .
M	the rac say its not their fault the way my sister was treated over the phone because it was their partners ( quindell motors ) manager she spoke to and not the breakdown manager she had spoken to that night .
M	i posted my phone and the money was in my account literally the next_day !
M	the wm000 was what i wanted to replace my old wm000 so the quality was assured but the prices did seem to vary somewhat .
F	i was promptly e_- mailed confirmation that my delivery charge would be waived , but it would have been nice , and much_better pr , to have had some communication confirming that for future " highland " customers this will be made clear on the website at the point where the delivery option is made .
M	i bought this deal for a 00 page book saving a lot of money and find it excellent to have as a keepsake to look at .
F	i ordered next say delivery flowers after christmas and they weren_'_t delivered until over a week_later .
M	brilliant service as usual from gak ( got a free drum key and some cymbal polish too !).
M	apparently this is common with very nowadays and i wish i had researched before - i used to a be littlewoods ( as they used to be called ) customer many_years_ago , no_problems then .
M	the delivery was late , the goods did not appear to be brand_new , they would not pay return carriage , they took_ages to issue a refund , they asked me to scan and return my invoice ( when it was available to download on their website ), they demanded my bank_account details when i had paid by paypal
F	0 - 0 delivery days became 0 .
F	they got delivered mid_afternoon !
M	when i opened up the box the contents were nicely_packed , took the motorcycle_helmet box out and it was horribly damaged .
F	i was then passed through to customer_services and spoke to a louise hill who said she would issue full issue while i was on the phone and it would show up in my bank within 0_days .
M	best prices i have found online .
M	not recommended at all .
F	i have now received my boots .
M	payment received and cleared within my bank_account within 00houra for both phones i sold recently .
F	wanted red cellophane which i was pleased to see was only
F	will not be using the company again .
M	having moved over to shopto after game '_s demise i '_ve been impressed , the prices have been the cheapest and the service is excellent
M	0 .
M	cannot recommend this company enough , they are fantastic .
M	we were told " no bbq today " without_any reason_why and with that we spent the rest of the day hungry .
F	very rude , and a liar !
M	tried for 0 days to order on - line for delivery in uk ordered in canada .
F	the print quality is not really a good quality .
M	however , mine was about 0 . 0kohms therefore this would indicate that it was ok .
F	initially amazing lead time for delivery , ordered pm late dec and received am next_day , a lead time that i wasnt_expecting this time of year .
F	calamari arrivedi in cold bowls , with wedge of lemon and mayonaise .
M	dpd find it and deliver it to me tomorrow or they don_'_t find it and you send out a replacement tomorrow .
M	jessica , you are a marvel .
F	i knew i could be liable for early cancellation_fees but my experience to date had so sincerely stressed me , not getting through to anyone who seemed to be able to at_least appear to know what needed doing as a next step , and to do it .
M	electric toothbrushes arrived safe and sound on sark ( in the channel_islands ) 00_hours after the order was placed !
M	saw the jacket online and taunton lesiure came up with best value free_postage and also 00_%_off .
M	job_done .
M	unbelievably good customer service with detailed , knowledgeable answers to questions being returned in no time at all .
F	i ordered the skinceuticals ce ferulic serum which was only slightly discoloured so i knew it was still fresh .
M	the actual cost of these id about £ 0 . 00 .
M	at that time one of the kits was out of stock , due in on the 0th_october .
F	have listened to 0 advertisements .
M	:)
M	will think_twice before_committing to you again unfortunately
F	ps .
M	found what i want on line .
F	i start again and the same thing happens .
M	previous problems include : no attempt , no card , late delivery , unprofessional conduct ( delivery after 0pm in an unmarked car by the agent obviously taking his son somewhere ), etc , etc , etc .
F	not the best really .
M	now given that the address was exactly the same address i had provided them with for a previous successful delivery this seems a little strange to put it mildly .
M	after having my racket for approx 0_weeks and only playing 0 competitive game and only 0 training_sessions the strings snapped during warm up for my 0nd competitive match , expected much more .
F	i preordered the item late on tues 0th_july . only for the courier to be knocking at my door at 0am on the monday . bearing in . ins we live in jersey and that the item should have been on pre order , i find this exceptional .
M	their prices are fantastic and the goods they provide are top of the range .
F	i have my refund !
M	i would recommend to anyone who_wants to send an item to use parcel0go .
F	delivery was prompt but parcel was damaged at the bottom and the delivery driver put it on the floor without telling us it was open so it looked fine until we picked it up and found the bottom open .
F	however , i had requested that it would not be delivered on either of two particular dates , and the pan was delivered on the first of those two dates .
M	as i said , i did my best not to be rude , but understanding .
M	tried_contacting them via_twitter with same effect - completely_ignored
M	i was very pleased to hear that they were delivered almost_immediately .
M	), they become a victim of their own success and have been criticised in a number of areas in the past , most recently for publishing ages of actors without their consent .
F	i ordered a high_chair one afternoon and it had arrived the next_morning !
M	no provision to use reward_points shown and 0 .
F	arrived very quickly .
F	when checking my e_mails , i had an e_mail with my address it was to be delivered to mum , i explained twice_now , its a present for my mum , okr they said that fine we will change it .
M	very poor customer service , only a computer not human .
M	ttfn
M	both other times i called i got put on hold whilst an agent asked for assistance from ' another agent ' after 00_minutes with no communication i gave up all hope and hung_up .
F	i '_ve_used photoworld about 00 times .
F	unfortunately they were a little tight and i had to return them , also very easy .
M	i would use again , but will take more care over finding out if an item is in stock first .
M	michael was polite and courteous and was keen to make_sure i was happy when he had finished .
F	why is it that companies like this one that set themselves up to do_business over the phone can '_t be bothered to find someone_who sounds as if they ' re even half - pleased , rather_than totally bored , that you ' re actually spending money with them .
M	following a complaint i returned the set for repair and they we returned still warped , bent with an added damage to the lens section .
F	we emailed to see if they had been despatched , to be told there is a stock problem .
F	i received emails_advising me of each_stage of the process and both were delivered very quickly .
F	otherwise it looks ok .
F	yes they were delivered at the right time with no message from whom they had come .
M	i have nothing but praise for the the quality of products and customer service i have received each and every time i have ordered from them .
M	completed several trades but took a whopping 0 . 0_weeks from posting my stuff to physically receiving my cheques which isn_'_t great and a bit of an archaic payment_method in my opinion . considering faster_payments are now the norm and used by other_companies .
F	we only had 0 hours and this was nowhere_near long enough .
F	hassle_free shopping !
M	all top rate .
M	after a week i phoned up to find they are out of stock .
M	oh , the shirt did start chafing my neck and nipples later on in the evening which wasn_'_t pleasant so will probably get a better quality shirt for next time .
M	i have had two orders from your company , and i have been happy with price and the product .
M	it is clear it was broken in transit , but the packaging was so poor , i am not surprised they were all broken .
M	i had to wait 0weeks for an appointment and on the morning whilst i was driving there to leave the car , i got an email from autoglass to tell me the booking had been " upgraded " and now would be done on a home visit !!!
F	have used several_times in the past .
F	certainly doesn_'_t have the feel of a new item i could have gifted a pre_- owned bracelet that way .
M	the website had limited information about the product .
F	he came and did the job with a smile , a joke and speed .
F	i have a pair of size 0 aigle_wellies and the clogs were tighter than them !
M	however , again this is another basic function which is lacking in their hosting services .
F	they have delivered our orders to addresses the other end of the country to where they are supposed to be , lost packages completely and left goods unsigned for out in the rain .
F	the door to door service is amazing no matter which courier is used .
F	came on monday 0th_may , could have had it on the sunday .
M	the booking , prices etc on the rentalcars . now site was good - no_problems at all .
F	i called customer service again at 00 . 00am and was told this time they would definitely call me back with an estimated time of delivery .
M	my speakers arrived the next_day and were the cheapest i could_find on the internet .
F	the tape does what i want , but i knew it would before i ordered .
F	the website said the blankets were in stock , followed_by an emailto say that there would be a two week delay .
F	so we wasted 00_minutes in the wrong place , then got lost trying to correct it , and the driver when we found him looked pretty disconsolate !
F	fast response to my order and great communication on lead times and delivery .
F	i had given no instruction to leave in a shed .
F	otherwise the delivery was fine , but the internet site should be more realistic to avoid_disappointment .
F	their customer service is excellent .
F	i have 0 cats , and have to use 0 different_types of food .
F	impeccable service with a real concern for customer_satisfaction , i especially like the fact they ask for the date of your party as it shows how much they value their customers .
M	definitely yes , because the service is better .
M	a large part of what looked like scaffolding was suddenly in my vision , i thought i had missed it when bang !
M	after 0 - 0 days i got an email from amazon apologising but saying the product wouldn_'_t be available for up to 0 month with a 0week window for delivery .
F	my sister didn_'_t receive her flowers until 00 : 00 !
M	i am surprised they were not more familiar with their own products .
M	timely , and accurate . what more can i say !
M	you do not need to do anything , we will contact you when your application has_been processed .
F	i ordered the same thing in another size .
F	thank god i paid with paypal otherwise i '_d probably never have got my money back .
F	felt that was a bit of a con .
F	00 days since my order has_been dispatched and i '_m still_waiting for it !
F	the reply was i don_’_t know .
M	i put in a paypal_dispute at which point link delight said they had received the grip and were checking it so i could cancel the dispute .
F	well , to be fair , plasticboxshop is the only company in the known universe to make and sell the square water buckets i urgently_needed .
M	had to use my own screws without which i would not have been able to install the blind - simple as that .
M	ok as far as company '_s go got the part i needed in the end but only after having to ring up loads of times and then wait for someone to call me who never did !
F	they will ring you back in an_hour . thats happened 0 times and still_waiting for a single call back .
F	great company , no_problems , would recommend .
M	“ i have stayed in an extra half hour but am going to have to rush now !
M	i would certainly recommend naturesbest .
M	however , i moved_house , and that was the beginning of a very sorry_saga .
M	so , i sent it back ( note ; using £ 0 p_&_p recorded - stupid post_office worker ) and resubmitted my order in the correct_size .
M	i trusted their estimate and got money from insurers for a new frame and eventually got around to buying a new one .
M	this made me have to cancel two sales transactions of a large and heavy book and a five disc and booklet of a music cd box set .
M	what more could ask for ?
M	i was really impressed at first , very professional .
M	the seats were only a few rows from the very top of the stadium .
M	i recieved a text_message from sony informing_me that the new console would be delivered between_0am to 0pm .
M	what i wanted , when i wanted it and at a price definitely liked
F	ideal as it was right outside the airport , so no walking or buses involved .
F	they are all very easy to make and taste fantastic .
M	the headband mic positions ideally for picking_up the whistles and sounds great over the pa . never used amplification before but the other guys have and they ' re well pleased with the result .
F	having said this my advisor went to great lengths to source me the same car from a dealer and honored the original deal which i found very satisfying .
F	i would use rawk again .
M	their email order confirmaton also gave_us a delivery tracking_number .
M	had a telemarketing cold call from 00000000000 .
M	eventually courier turned_up 0 days_later .
F	quick service and great quality products .
F	the total charge was £_000 . 00 for a half a day at the show .
F	i checked with my friend who i sent them too and she said they were beautiful , that was a relief as i '_ve sent flowers before and normally because you don_'_t see them your never sure of this .
M	simply_electronics would help themselves if they adopted systems and packaging of a similar standard as amazon .
F	i had even called lastminute . com 0 mins before the online booking and confirmed that there were 0 rooms available at the venue .
F	to my horror , i then received an e_- mail i received 00_hours before the cleaner was due , was entitled " booking error " and went on to tell me that their new website had accepted postcodes in areas that they don_'_t yet cover so they couldn_'_t provide a cleaner for the next_day !
F	offer a refund but i cant get to the post_office to return the item within the required time due to having a c - section .
F	get back later .
M	useful , have had problems with the connection too my bank once couple months_ago and now
F	i ordered style ' osan ' in white and was surprised that this shoe is certainly not white , but more of a light pebble colour , although the photographs clearly show a normal white leather .
M	information about delivery is incomplete or missing .
M	in other words i do not have any rights !!
F	i was told on the 0th_march that my order had been cancelled because the item was not currently available .
F	i buy this because it is a speciality product we have grown used to .
M	they would argue the size against the ones you enter and ask for a picture of the unopened parcel for proof !
M	received only one despite having paid for two .
F	they do not always collect or deliver on time , on several_occassions i have sat in and waited for them to either collect a parcel or deliver one , only to be left waiting for several days !
F	but since using the probiotic max for the last 0_months i have found that the episodes have reduced to about once or twice a month , so much_easier to cope with .
M	simply put , cdkeys delivered .
F	prompt receipt if posting bag with instructions .
F	i demanded our money back , but stoneacre said it was their policy to try and fix it first .
M	my order was filled and i received my contact_lenses within 0 ( working ) days .
M	video showed a simple four screw fitting , where in reality there was over a dozen which became a problem due to issue 0 !
F	that was 0_days ago .
M	most of the time , saving a few_pounds from amazon isn_'_t worth it .
M	they '_ve taken enough franchises under their wing and prematurely buried them - amongst them some of my favourites .
F	this firm has a different way of operating , trying hard to push you into buying overpriced insurance ( for example , by telling you that roadside assistance , even for mechanical defects , will not be available if you don_'_t buy insurance for >€ 000_per week ).
F	i weigh just under nine stones , so weight isn_'_t the issue .
F	i am very upset with the stress see tickets have put me through just to what seems to me get more money out of the tickets there selling .
F	i '_d buy more from them if the prices were lower .
F	the only_negative_thing i can think of is that there should be more !!
F	thank_you for your email .
M	they fit well and they varifocals quality are good again .
F	!.
M	delivery was very speedy which also pleased me .
M	a very thick cast_iron manhole !!
M	now i see you for what you really are .
F	first of all they mislaid it at the drop_off point for four days and then told me it has_been lost by the man in the van who they said that they couldn_'_t contact .
M	kind_regards ." so you can see why i gave this 0_stars
M	found it : ordered it : got it - all in three_days - thank_you .

F	the soft items were put in first , then the heavy cans were put on top .
F	customer service brilliant and delivery prompt .
M	i entered shop ( i wont call it a super - market because nothing is super ), i walked up to c / services desk where there was 0 women dealing_with 0 customer .
M	i wish i ' d kept my money for jan sales !
F	i had no_problems or worries and it was all straight_forward .
F	its superfab !
M	great service
F	the whole system is straight_forward and simple to understand .
M	but it wasn_'_t delivered the next_day ( saturday ) because driver screwed_up again .
F	getting the item is as important as a good website , shopping etc experience - so to wait in all day for the delivery only to have city_link not bothered if they deliver your stuff or not has ruined this shopping_experience .
F	unacceptable .
M	i am a loyal and regular customer and the question should never have been asked .
M	i look_forward to the next time i use juno .
M	something that they are obliged according to european consumer_protection laws to do .
M	of late , however , they '_ve been slipping badly , with poor availability and damaged stock .
M	but , the sizes of my garments has left me a little_confused .
F	i heard_nothing more until the 00th , when i received a " reminder " that the prescription had not been received .
F	very prof company was disappointed item purchased did not fit . poss more my fault than company . will not_hesitate to order other items for my cavapoo aj

F	i received a message from you to say these had been delivered yesterday as requested - they have not been delivered !
F	thank_you , excellent service .
M	pretty_much no one really cared !
F	if i would have known about this , i would never have ordered anything with them .
F	flowers came with brown patches , flowers looked like they were already dying , set them up for my mum for when she returned home and she asked if i had hidden them in a cupboard for a few day without water !!
M	i know this is not true as i worked for ups for over 0 years .
F	now made a complaint and waiting on some response from topman .
M	great price . delivered on time . easy to order .
M	will have no_hesitation in using again .
M	i feel the markup was a little dear though .
M	i must_say that karen who i spoke to was one of the best representatives for any company i have spoke to in a long time !
M	at this point we decided to leave , without so much as a goodbye from the staff .
M	i '_ve ordered a few things from bbw and they are great quality and usually arrive very quickly .
M	although there was a delay in obtaining my purchase i found the person on the telephone very helpful .
F	with multivits you have to ' know '!
F	on the day of delivery i was emailed and text a one hour delivery time_slot which was accurate !
F	it goes without saying that i will never ever use iflorist again !
F	pointed_out to said seller that as she had not given any written notice before the sale that she didn_'_t fund returns , it was her obligation to do so .
F	i never received the item but as he had proof of posting i had no come_back !!!
M	however , i do still have some criticisms of the parcelhero service .

M	two things could be improved :
M	dog supplement paid .
M	on our return we thought that the signs for the car - park were really poor .
M	also included was a copy of the latest speedgraphic catalogue , interesting reading !
F	earlier this month i returned them again for repair and once completed you sent them to my old address again , then blamed me for not having completed the change of address section .
M	today arrives and i thought it best to check with orange at about 00 . 00 .
M	i find that chemist_direct consistently offers good value on large pack royal_canin dog_foods .

M	i '_ve been interested in supplements for health since about 00 years old and have tried quite a few down the years for conditions suck as osteo arthritis of the hips and moderate depression and as such i '_ve tried quite a few company '_s that sell these pills and potions and i can tell you that , what you have here with simply_supplements is the highest utmost standards and best customer_services i '_ve ever come_across .
M	had to re - arrange collectio from depot .
M	each time no_hassle and payment received ( cheque ) the following_day after being received by mazuma .
M	took a week for jam_golf to send me my club , they blamed the ups carrier but i ' d expect a better delivery service .
F	always feel i can relie on them to deliver .
F	second time i '_ve_used serenata_flowers & ordered some for my mum '_s birthday .
M	delivery driver very pleasant .
M	generally the car could have been a lot cleaner .
M	on this occasion the 000_euro_deposit stated on my confirmation became a 0000 euro_deposit when i arrived at gold car in rome . that '_s their requirement for the class of car we hired .
F	this treatment is completely_unacceptable .
F	we got on and said " good morning " and added " we were glad to have seen him ". no response :( he just stared right through us .
M	going out of their way to ensure they got the lens to me as i made my way to my flight .
M	success !

F	id_0000000
F	poor customer service .
F	this meant none of the passengers could move !
M	i ordered 0 records - this was my first order with juno having been recommended .
F	job_done .
M	don_'_t expect any pleasantries from the branch i had visited , the staff carefully_selected to have no personality or friendly outlook , and yet have been specially trained in rubbing their hands in a miserly manner and grinning eagerly at the till whilst exchanging some unwelcome cheek .
M	i should also like to apologise for the use of a course word in my original review and state for the record that after spending £_000 . 00 on your company products i would use you again and would recommend your products .
F	i am told by the recipient that the flowers were beautiful .
M	ordered easily designed simple delivered quick and a great price a very simple and quick solution !
M	i called fedex who told me that the package had been delivered to a neighbour ( on the wrong street ).
F	if you cannot fulfill next_day then don_'_t offer it alongside of the specific 00am & 00pm next_day options .
M	if a company won_'_t respond to a simple product enquiry then just imagine their attitude_towards a customer who had a problem .
M	- having to hunt through the faq to find how to pay the courier an_hour before they arrived .
F	hoping lots of new growth will start in spring .
F	great service - very helpful advice for a new customer and great final designs !
M	0 .
F	cannot recommend highly_enough .
M	although this may not be within the remit , it is information that would have been relevant if a choice of airline was available .
F	item arrived the next_day exactly as_described :-)
M	i was so convinced i was right that i accepted the change , - long_story_short - i was right - my meter was reported as reading " erroneously " and the percentage of over reading was documented - this was in march_0000 and despite me making contact many_times about a settlement from them they have made no offer to compensate - indeed i just get the normal " we are so sorry you are having a problem with us " emails .
M	printerland . co . uk was recommended to me by a friend as i needed a new printer .
M	i think sigma is still a great shop , but my aftersales experience has certainly given me a tainted view .
M	was discounted heavily and as a result was £_00 instead of £_000 from argos . what a bargain !
M	friendly and very helpful , with good rates .
M	i don_'_t think there is anything wrong with the mattress - certainly not enough to justify sending it back ( and i am sure if i had asked jr would have probably accepted / swapped it ).
M	our new hotpoint_washing_machine was supplied at the right price - cheaper_than amazon & ebay & john_lewis .
F	the cute little icon addition at to end of her name is so unique .
F	from this point it took them 0 hour and 00_minutes to bring my car back .
M	ridiculous and unacceptable .
F	my fiance '_s wedding_ring was perfect first time , but mine didn_'_t quite match my engagement_ring band as i wished so i sent them both back to match the wedding_ring to the engagement_ring band .
M	i used british_gas over 0 years and they always sent me estimate which i paid in trust that i was paying correct amount , never i was sent meter read request , eventually when i found out that i paid them thousands in over charges they refused any refund , didn_'_t even both explaining is to why estimates were sent instead of meter read requests .
F	i would certainly not consider booking through ebookers again .

M	i '_m generally happy with littlewoods , however there have been occasions when customer_services have been slow to respond to a query , and very occasionally no response at all .
M	when it arrived i thought it had been damaged .
M	it took a little_bit long for my check to come
M	" ryanair - boldly taking customer service to depths no - one has plumbed before "
F	i eventually gave up again and phoned them in yet another failed attempt to pay off the card and after 00_mins i got transferred to someone " higher up " in customer service who offered to freeze the interest until the start of april when i would be able to pay off the card ( apparently you can only make 0 payments in any one month before their system won_'_t allow another payment on the account ), even_though my attempts to pay failed they still count as payments .
F	the wardrobes give no extra space than standard wardrobes purchased in a store would provide - it completely defeats the object .
F	despite_numerous e_-_mails from me to them , no reply , and without a direct telephone_number they are not contactable .
M	easy to use website which is fully explicit .
F	!
M	from buying online to delivery was easy and they kept me informed of delivery time and was even called by the delivery drive on the morning to tell how long they will be .
M	it '_ll take another 0_weeks to get another pair , by which time i '_ll have been on holiday for ages .
F	highly_recommended .
F	i did not shout at her and she just continued to tell me she was terminating the call .
M	. 0 months is ridiculous !
M	progressed to the departures drop_off point and pulled over wondering where we had gone_wrong .
M	oh , and in addition , some pleasant girl at sp actually locked me out of my account by resetting my password instead of the final account payment system .
F	one item was missing from the package although the despatch_note said it was included .
M	they need to catch up with the customer service improvements of modern companies .

M	i ordered a sloth mask and when looking at the pciture on the website it looks fantastic and well_worth the £_00 including_postage but on receipt of my mask it was not the same but a cheap immation of the one advertised . not worth more than £ 0 .
F	very disappointing .
M	will be used again and recommend to people .
F	i know there is not much beautybay could do about it but exceptional service would be to have known about the sale in_advance .
F	i will try the same company again , but will check that the prescription has arrived

F	when it was finally sorted_out the emails were informative and clear and as i said above the recipient was delighted .
F	absolutely unacceptable customer service delivered through 0 of the leeds based stores .
M	wouldn_'_t go through anyone_else !
M	a good thing to judge a company by is how they respond to glitches so i await with interest .
M	" sorry_sir , we cannot issue a replacement until the dpd investigation is complete .
M	great service , website easy to use , and good price - with prompt service .

F	i only wish i had found holidays_please a lot earlier_than i did .
F	my only gripes with the site is that the delivery is quite_expensive , but understandably so since the clothes are imported from asia .
M	excellent service - quick and inexpensive
M	the instructions they give you for their site are not even written for the software they provide you with

F	for a refund and i then discovered that the goods were in fact from argos .
F	website has very clear photos and it was easy to select seasonal flowers .
M	you kept me aware of the order progress , despatch , and even a reminder on the day of delivery .
F	all in all , i have been very pleased .
M	the items i ordered arrived in a very short time , iwas very satisfied with what i had ordered .
F	it took 0 week to arrive and i had to get some extra food to see me on .
M	they knew the item was faulty before they sent it , they just sent it anyway .
M	at this point they had taken payment for the part but would not ship because they now wanted an additional payment for shipping .
M	i should have been on a certain date i missed that and when i rang them to explain the speed at which they dealt_with my mistake i was told no problem they would see me without_any notice .

M	however , i started_using the pans .
F	i would give no stars if i could .
F	?
F	it doesn_'_t activate it straight_away either and i have to wait_until_0pm tomorrow to use it . was going to use it today on a shopping trip .
F	i called again on the 00th day as i had received no refund !
F	however , it didn_'_t work .

F	car failed mot but no hard_sell for repairs .
F	i am booking up for my third holiday day very soon .
F	they arrived about three_weeks after the order date .
M	will never use or recomend them .

F	we just lost the property which ticked all the boxes and were not given the right to bid for it !

M	then it all went wrong .
F	i had to logout , and then start again .
M	well_packed , high_quality product and absolutely excellent service .
M	the lenses on this delayed order then had to be remade so an order that should have taken a week took over a month .
M	the order i got was the bright_blue_orchids ( i think ) and the boquet was tiny .
F	the driver spoke little english & was unable to offer an explanation .
F	i was passed from_pillar to post and each time had to explain my situation .
M	there was a smearing of dust all over the car plus bird_droppings which cost my husband £_00 to get it cleaned .
M	00 / 00 recommended and i know where i will be going in the future next time i need a printer .

M	i '_m_sure that those able to drink caffeinated drinks could_find something to suit them from the huge_array available , but it '_s not worth the extra_cost for the single choice of decaffeinated .
F	i ordered two_pairs of glasses from googles 0 u and when they turn '_t up my sunglasses were twisted .
F	it has_been almost a month now .
F	have to click onto homepage then go back to check my basket again then i can see the products i picked .
F	this penalty is totally unfair to existing_customers and penalises loyalty .
F	so annoyed hope i will get a refund asap !
M	i bought my starter_pack of liberro reaslis in october_0000 and was very happy with the product .
F	ended_up buying another bulb which is different as they no_longer do the original ones i bought .
M	they have the monopoly and force any other_companies out .
F	!
F	good price i was offered and didn_'_t change once they had the phone .
F	i think i am a good customer who orders regularly and have done so for about 0 years would be nice i could do everything on line and not take so much time on the phone .

M	after_placing a number of orders in quick_succession and seeing them fulfilled to perfection , i emailed their customer service department to commend them on their great service .
F	takes all the stress out of parking and shuttle_buses .
F	used this company as they were offering the best prices on the product i required .
F	i got the room for half the prices quoted elsewhere .
F	wonder_if the company still the , original one ?
M	its not that it is expensive , but i dont like being held to ransom .
M	fortunately i '_ve already tried the specific bulb out before , so i knew what i was looking for , and lightbulbs_direct had the right bulbs and the most aggressive pricing - with a great online discount & bulk purchase deal .
F	found this great website offering free_p_&_p for all products .
F	!
F	i placed my order on - line on 0 / 0 / 00 without having read the customer reviews about this company .
F	don_'_t do it .
F	0 really unusable pair of spectacles
F	they do exactly_what they say on the tin !
M	does anyone really fall for it ?
F	one saving_grace was that they have given me a goodwill_gesture of a £_00 currys voucher .
F	the flowers were delivered on the correct day , one bunch was requested after 0pm but was delivered earlier so surprise was ruined .
F	we were so disappointed about the change in policy that we took p_& 0 last month instead .
F	i purchased from the website over a week_ago and i still do not have my item .
F	i purchased showroom_shine .
F	stick with mazuma_mobile , guaranteed happiness and helpful - ness everytime !
M	the pictures where too grainy for my liking and some were very dark and too saturated .
M	ebay feedback means nothing , you realise that you can cheat the ebay system through low price purchases etc to artificially alter your score and dissatisfied_customers receiving forced paypal refunds can '_t leave_feedback once the transaction is nullified so of course there '_s less negative_feedback for him on there .
M	they were listed as available for next_day delivery and it was essential for me to have them within 0 days in order to meet a contract deadline .
M	i buy on line because it is very convenient given i live and work abroad .

M	built it up on xmas day and found 0 different aspects of damage .

M	this is the second time used ebookers with no_problems .
M	hey there !
M	this public traded company called ocado must be writing its own review in my humble_opinion .
M	flowers were as shown although some roses looked several days old and were already_wilting .
F	well_done in the end dreams .
M	to be fair to them , the item was as_described and the price was great , but i am not sure i would use them again as there are a lot of internet traders out there providing better service .
F	i bought this because i have had a total knee_replacement , and one of the physiotherapy exercises is stretching the quadriceps and hamstrings , i can now do this at home as often as required .
F	drop_off in front of the terminal_building - step off the bus and into the terminal , and repeat backwards on return .
M	thankfully , i haven_'_t had any situations like that , either as a buyer or a seller , so i '_m not sure how paypal would deal with a situation like that .

M	would definately_use again and recommend to family and friends .
F	sent an_email to which i '_ve still had no reply .
F	the house pump i ordered arrived quickly and well_packaged .
M	booking experience was simple and efficient but was given wrong information on the hotel !
F	the emailed paper_work with all details arrived promptly and the parking company at the other end always knows about my booking with all details .
M	for me the only thing that lets them down is there delivery charges .
M	excellent delivery arrangements .
M	i was told else where that city_link only update tracking 0 times , once collected , item arrives morning of delivery and item has_been delivered .
M	fast to take my money and horrible non_existent cs
F	not so much due to yourselves but the 0rd_party , and the process can be confusing .
M	ordered a kookaburra rogue 000 ' heavy ', but received a ' medium ' after more than a week .
F	ecco also changes £ 0 for return postage .
F	thank_you serenata for everything , i will most definitely be using you again .
M	i do not do reviews .
F	i challenged as it was miss selling .
M	however the man who answered the phone on my return 00 days_later was much more helpful and did in fact leave the car as close to the arrivals area as he could .
F	we ordered two desktop computers from dell ( order # 00000000 ) which showed a ' shipping ' date of next_day and their pop up delivery message said - ' delivery : products ship on the next business day ( excl .
F	very interesting .
M	then i got my contract , not as we disgust , so i phoned bt and complained , she sorted it out and said " i see you ordered bt_vision as well !"
M	( friday 00 / 00 / 00 ) [ day before gig ]
M	asking staff if it was possible to see a macbook_air which was not glued to the counter yielded a simple ' no ' other requests yielded the same answer .
M	it completely wastes your time by which time you '_ve turned away some genuine buyers .
M	no more holes in wooly jumpers !
F	i thought it a little expensive at first until i looked at other_sites and found it to be very good value especially when you think parcels get from the uk to half way around the world in one day .
M	i have 0 x vodafone apps , 0 x iphone 0 data counter on my phone & when cmpared to vodafone internal data system all show different amounts , 0 . 0gb to 0 . 0gb .
M	would have given them 0 or 0_stars but for that .
F	i went to pay with them with capital bonds and the manager refused them saying they was probley stolen .
M	i will be speaking to them again today and will be delighted to amend the review if they change their stance , but i doubt they will .
M	synes det_er under al kritik .
F	before my purchase i rang to get some further information , to make_sure i was buying a suitable i instrument .
M	it closes at the same early time as the phone lines !

M	delivered within three_days ( including two public_holidays ) could not fault the service
F	nutshell - avoid this company !
F	however , when we complaint about this issue to the company , they lied , found all_sorts of excuses , and even tried to blame their fault on us .
M	modern , stylish looking trainers . not the cheapest i have ever bought but hopefully you get what you pay for & they will last me a long time .
M	the communications from deal instigation to completion was second to none .
F	after 00 days ( on an apparently 0 - 0 working day standard delivery ), there was still no sign of the item , so emailed via the website .
F	i pointed_out that this was down to them .
F	i ordered two_pairs of glasses in the same frames ( but different_colours ).
M	quick_turnaround , good value for money and the lenses are great .
F	good delivery and love the product .
M	what ’_s more is its ‘ live_chat ’ isn_'_t ' live ' after 0000_hrs .
M	if you create a truthful and honest review about an experience you have had with an online supplier who use trustpilot and should you dare to publish a poor service , the retailer then objects if you give them a low score .
M	i will be taking my custom elsewhere .
M	the splash back did take a couple of weeks to arrive , but more trouble some was that it arrived damaged , a very small dimple in the metal .
F	it would have been perfect if that had been the case .
M	i went on line and bought a washing_machine from a o . com .
M	cheap and super quick delivery ,
F	once on board our section was shoe horned in .
F	great service 00 out of 00 .

F	when looking for a honeymoon i came_across holidays_please via a google_search , i simply made and enquiry which lead me to andrea white !
M	kind_regards
F	still_waiting .
M	bought a rear_light and there was a 00_%_discount_code on the site so a great price ( inc_postage ), got even better .
M	my issue with company has_been resolved but would recommend times on iphone_app after noon read 00 , 00 , 00 etc not 0 pm 0 pm also could have been a lot_easier to resolve this at initial point of contact not by me leaving negative_review
M	so , actually i picked_up the car at 00 : 00
F	i spent my time giving them my personal_data , only to find out the item was not in stock ( in a subsequent email ), and they had no idea when it would be in .
M	they renew 00 month_contract without_consulting you
F	l : illys were lovely .
M	great service !
M	in terms of data , all was there that i required , 00 %.
M	id is 0000000 .
M	will use again , nice quick reliable service
M	from sales through order processing to delivery very professional and efficient .
M	it '_s been six_months now since first call and am giving up hope this will ever be sorted
F	need to get your prices down for , like my hermes
M	complete_satisfaction .
M	i '_ve been driven to write this review because of how utterly frustrated i '_ve become chasing unsuccessfully an order placed over two_weeks_ago .
F	again , i rang and spoke to someone and explained the same thing again !
F	i really liked the add on options at each_stage - deluxe_bouquet , vase , good range of beautiful gifts , cards and even a glossy photo .
F	delivery came finally after having to wait months as item had not been in stock and it took two months to get it back in .
F	no way to run a business
F	alison
M	nice one yodel , welcome to the conference of couriers .
M	apart_from the 0 year_warranty there is not real difference than buying on ebay .
M	there was a full 0inches difference in the width between my previous one ( xl ) and your recent delivery .
F	city - link tracking , i purchased friday . and it was delivered the following_monday .
F	unfortunately the reds on the canvas came out brighter than the reds in the photo file ; making the peoples_faces look very red and sunburnt !
F	this item arrived on time and well packaed .
M	i '_ve bought a few_times from ao online . never had a problem and they are always the first place i look . normally the cheapest aswell . free delivery is a major plus . i would always recommend
F	mattresses and duvets arrived exactly on time as promised .
F	how unprofessional !
M	when this was pointed_out to dentocare staff they initially claimed that it was my mistake and that i had incorrectly ordered .
M	delivery was near instant .
F	will never buy any thing from them any more .
M	i was just about to cancel and start again when i thought i ' d better check my e_- mails to see if i had received confirmation of payment and there it was - yet the payment was still happily cycling away on screen as if unprocessed .
F	i appreciated receiving a £_00 credit ( that i never used ) due to the frustration .
M	still a good card , but my , how the rewards have been cut .
M	the call lasted 00_minutes ( most of the time with customer_services ) .
F	i can_honestly_say that the site was very easy to use , photos very good quality and the rugs when they arrived were fantastic quality .
F	in addition they provide lots of clear and helpful information for newbies to the world of vaping as well as posting interesting_articles on the subject .
F	i don_'_t check my emails every_single day but do check them fairly regularly .
M	funnily_enough , about 0 months later , i looked out of the rear patio_doors to find a scruffy yellow bag in the middle of the lawn .
M	i arrived at palma and boarded the bus at about 00 : 00 .
F	the website was easy to use and they were very accomodating when i called to change the date of fitting .
M	no_complaints , kept in touch with delivery dates .
M	i have refunded my customers post as i '_m an honest kind of guy and don_'_t like people to be let_down , my loss i know but i prefer to be honest .
F	i contacted torrs again half an_hour later to only be told that my treadmill had only been sat at a depot only 00_minutes away from my home since saturday_morning .
M	thanks very much , never used before but i will always use again .
F	i now in the process of renewing my home insurance again and have no_intention of purchasing it through_topcashback .
F	liz marsden
M	emailed customer service about the above and got no reply .
M	luckily i opted for the insurance but it has still been painful .
M	!
F	!
M	very disappointed with the product purchased from makita , half of it was missing and not even so much as a ' sorry ' or a ' drill bit ' for their poor performance .
F	i recommend you try goodlife_homebrew shop they have all you need to make great homemade wine .
M	within a matter of days i was banking the money , cannot_fault the service one bit
F	and i now have to pick it up from their service centre .
F	the lamb_casserole was quite likeable once i got past the initial strong herby aroma .
M	one of theose companies that " gets " web shopping and the need to provide excellent service to keep customers coming_back .
F	i would use this company again .
M	low and behold it arrived as promised , very pleased .
M	i assume from clumsy installation .
F	bit_pricey though !
M	recommend golfbase for choice of equipment , speed of delivery and quality of customer service .
M	if you stated on your website that you used yodel i would never have ordered from you .
F	i ordered my gas wall heater online
M	their only redeeming_feature is that they refunded me promptly .
M	i '_m impressed with their service .
F	wish i '_d gone to morrisons , spent the £_00 plus delivery on the beautiful bunches they have !
F	we feel appalled this is how they run the business especially at the current economical climate and there is no way this company will survive .
F	i replied to their e_- mail with my feedback but haven_'_t yet had a response .
M	i would now hesitate to recommend key .
F	the mobile checkins are great as these are not included in the retention_fee , but sometimes the app has problems and you cannot check in .
M	true to their word they gave_me a call , and i ordered the goods on - line .
M	wow , posted my phones on saturday_morning , money in my bank_account by monday lunch time .
F	also , jonathan was really helpful and nice on the phone and it was a pleasure to do_business with you .
F	if an item is out of stock you can request email notification when it becomes_available , which is a great facility .
M	great deals
M	they are superb at providing really good delivery rates for large parcels that other will not even quote for .
M	people at the rug_house were always pleasant to deal with and seemed_genuinely sorry for the inconvenience .
M	no tip .
F	:)
M	you company collect_+ really are incompetent and hte replies you are sending should be read by all future clients before they make the same mistake i did .
M	in service terms it makes very little sense to me to have an online advisor that cannot talk with other areas of the business .
M	i was initially very pleased with my smart looking new yale front_door and side_panels .
F	took them to the post_office tuesday and just had an_email to say the money has_been refunded today ( thursday ).
M	also like thire free application for kindleoooks making the reader free across all the main platforms !
M	i guessing now with the time that has passed i will not .
F	they were already in - don_'_t know what happened with the system - but as i got a request for feedback i assume my email address was correct .
M	after making an order online i rang to make a small change ( tariff ) to my pre_- order for a sony_xperia z , the rep i spoke to said they couldnt amend my order , all they could do was cancel and resubmit it but i was more concerned to hear my application had not been accepted and i had not been contacted despite having made this order 00 days earlier !
F	total liars !!!
M	so basically i '_m out $_00 and realize that it '_s partially my fault , and also that it '_s not the end of the world with a transfer of this size , but ultimately i was neither happy nor unhappy with currency_solutions .
M	their cheltenham_store is under staffed and they cancel appointments for the bike to be fixed with a couple of days notice .
F	wow .
M	having to file a complaint via mastercard to get my money back .
M	the delivery costs were very similar .
F	good quality storage_boxes better_than i had hoped for .
M	why ask for special instructions if you can '_t keep to them ?
M	i would much rather have spent an extra £_00 and bought from a reputable_company .
M	the ferry itself and the crossing was faultless but the food being breakfast was disgusting and on the verge of unedible , was stone cold when served but when cooked was burnt to a crisp , the price would of been ok if it had been cooked properly and nice but it so wasnt it was foul , shame as it meant on our way back we ate before getting on the ferry !
M	thanks for warning me through this experience , i '_ll make a point of not coming_back !
M	unfortunately i think most companies are doing this now so all as bad as each other but gold car were generally good apart_from the above .
F	they sent the shipping labels and i attached them to the packages .
M	brilliant !
M	incidentally , they don_'_t have a telephone service , do not let the published number deceive you in to thinking they will answer the phone , it '_s a droll little automated selection followed_by the phone ringing out , there '_s no one there .
M	i challenged this .
M	they did not charge me the postage for this second pair , spent some time on the phone checking the fit compared to the first pair , and they arrived within 00_hours of ordering .
M	arrived in 0 days ( ordered on a sunday ) in very sturdy_packaging .
F	we followed the procedure of confirming our pickup times etc .
F	since installation we have had strong_winds , the unit is so well installed its stuck firm with no_issues .
F	brilliant service , made even better by the fact i was emailed an arrival slot so knew when to wait in .
F	this has caused me a great deal of distress and i will never ever be purchasing anything from dreams again .
F	first time i had used this company for chocolate products .
F	they happily took my £_00 from my account a couple of weeks_ago but blatently never delivered .
F	goldentours booked me on a tour of the queen elizabeth olympic park in june_0000 , but when i turned_up , i was told by the security guards that the tour no_longer existed .
F	hope collectplus will keep and maintain their service as i will definitely use them again .
F	we had to wait about 00_minutes for our car to be returned .
M	still no fefund .
M	the phone when it arrived is brilliant , but the dispatch is agonisingly slow , it took 0 days just to pack it for shipping .
F	awful experience bad customer service too
M	firstly calling to offer additional boosts to save call costs when the boost would cost more than my total call costs !
M	i made a manual payment for what i had calculated to owe them and ignored all communication thereafter as i had changed to plusnet a couple of days_later .
M	take a look at their literature and you '_ll see plenty of wording about guarantees .
F	when i tried to alter the arrangements on dpd site , it wouldn_'_t let_me so the items were delivered on the tuesday after i '_d had to re - arrange my day - thought i '_d got that one covered .
F	as i approached the greenhouse i could see immedately that something was wrong .
F	after promising to deliver the furniture within 0_weeks , i had to chase them for a delivery date , only to be told they could not deliver for a further 0_weeks and would not deliver on a day that was suitable for me .
F	totally appalling customer service .
M	£ 0000 seemed fair and comparable to other specs seen from pc_specialist etc so i was quite pleased with what i ordered .
F	no difficulties in web based ordering and arrived very quickly
M	in short , don_'_t put your faith in eflorist for special / meaningful occasions . there is a real chance that they will let you down in more ways than one .
M	when fully erected i thought it would be a little more stable than it is .
F	how on earth is that next_day delivery ??
F	i was really impressed with the speed of service and the quality of the glasses .
F	too much effort and hassle for 0 pair of poorer_quality shoes ( my last pair is 0 years old and new ones which arrived of much_cheaper make ).
F	it looks a fantastic proffesional site .
M	i sent off a 0 - month old_iphone 0 that had been in a case the whole time .
M	i was going to throw the old hands free phones away & buy new but i decided to purchase some new rechargeable_batteries , hey_presto the phones are like new again .
M	very fast service & very clear_instructions , worked_perfectly on samsung
M	kyle maguire
F	we wanted a box of chocolates for france and needed them with us quickly to ake with us .
F	quality of the flowers was ok but they didn_'_t last long as they had clearly been sitting in the courier warehouse / van for too long .
M	i tried to contact customer service to cancel my order and guess_what ?
F	matt turned_up when he said he would , explained what he was going to do , and said he would give me a shout when he was finished .
F	and on arrival back at leeds_bradford the transport was awaiting our arrival . what more can we ask for .
M	its starting to become the next co - op .
F	recommend nah , the call back was within ten_minutes , the person on the phone was helpful and sorted me out very quickly .
F	!
F	if you want the phone to be put down as having a fault then add that to the drop down box !
F	i have emailed twice looking my refund and phone line is always engaged - still to date the 00th of october - no refund or acknowledgement that my refund is being done .
M	dont_waste your time with all the other_places as they dont even have full time surgeons .
M	both of these omissions where highlighted to us by another member of staff when questioned on our return .
M	one thing i ' d like the site to do is to show fares for a whole week or month in the way that some airlines like jet0 do .
F	i received two dispatched texts at midday , then nothing more .
M	we were miles_away from any shops so out of desperation i managed to get a pizza delivered but had to miss some activities to go meet the guy .
M	having great fun .
F	it is a company with no customer service , no professionalism and definitely no ethics .
F	not companies fault but i have had better from local_florists .
M	despite my repeated telephone_calls and emails , china_chaps remained resolute that the problem was with dartington_glass .
F	i found this very poor service on their behalf .
M	highly_recommended .
F	i '_m not bothered by a delay in delivery per_se , but i '_ve sent them 0 emails requesting despatchement confirmation and they simply do not reply .
M	supposingly delivered but person signed it reception and at wrong post_code so parcel never given to the owner no idea were it gone to
M	but when i put the costume together i discovered that the inflatable had a hole in .
M	decided that they didn_'_t seem to care so had the joint reworked and the surfaces smoothed .
F	in the picture i could see the cooked brown buckwheat - " kasha " - as it should be , so i was looking_forward to getting it .
M	the staff are really friendly and helpful , more than willing to walk me through my failing .
M	the delivery was very fast and there was no problem with the item when installed .
M	they were unable to commit to a time the following_day , so i will have to take another day off work .
M	customer service manager william hayton - didn_'_t even phone back
M	after ordering , chose a delivery date which suited as i work long hours .
F	would be good to over communicate to customers to keep them in the loop .
F	the service from this company is appalling .
M	it took like 0 phone_calls for them to actually give me a valid code . but it eventually worked .
M	i was told all items were in stock , and the conformation e_- mail to say my delivery was due on the 0st nov . well , 0 empty tubs turned_up , 0 out of 0 items i ordered , so i waited another day , maybe there had been a mess up .
M	ordered flowers a fortnight ago , to be delivered on valentine '_s day .
F	a courtesy_call would have been a better thing to do rather_than assume i '_d read my emails the flowers then arrived on the saturday as originally requested - very confusing
M	well i ordered this item and it has taken over 0_weeks to not get here .
M	i ordered my harris_tweed_jacket through farley '_s as they were listed on the harris_tweed website .
F	compared to other_retailers i think these details should be part of the company '_s focus on customer service .
M	it still doesn_'_t mean they are going to answer the phone though !!!
M	i ordered a set of replacement erasers fo my lamy pencil .
M	did get a pants pink sunglasses bag tho .
F	i would recommend this company to anyone , because of their efficency at sending out their orders .
F	especially when they were for such a sad and sensitive occassion .
F	i received an_email to say the item had been dispatched but it never arrived .
M	wouldn_'_t really mind but £_00 for 0 cardboard_boxes is outrageous .
F	the guy before us got his quote based on make , model and year . database should have recognized it was an 0 cylinder vehicle , but wbac representative kept using that against him to joggle down the price , a lot .
M	i saw that an email address was recommended by members of the company on here - i thought great , that should provide some answers .
M	when the records hadn_'_t arrived by the friday i phoned juno and spoke to a very helpful guy called andrew who investigated and then said that there had been a problem whereby they couldn_'_t tell whether the records had been despatched or not and therefroe couldn_'_t tell me what was happening with any certainty .
M	the photo showed roses much larger and prominent then delivered i didn_'_t not feel value for money this time .
M	top_marks to mr_memory .
M	totally_useless , and highly arrogant when things go_wrong .
F	i waited on the email to prove she had spelt the name wrong but the email did not come .
F	was ok but there was only one option to go for .
M	noise complaints and situations were handled well .
M	the sky_poker community is fantastic too either just for chatting and fun or the best advice around to help improve your game .
F	i '_ve still given 0_stars though because i can_imagine it would be no problem to return it if i had the time frame .
F	very good service .
F	i ordered from this company using a group on voucher , didn_'_t realise_until afterwards it could take up to 0_weeks for delivery .
F	click the link to set_up a menrchant account to accept credit_cards and you get taken to a form that only applies to us customers !
F	no called received so i called again an spoke to brian , eh then said someone tried to call me but could not get answer to which i told him was pure lies and also told about the convo earlier .
M	*********************** update update update ******************************
F	arrived promptly .
F	i bought these tickets as part of my daughter '_s christmas and now she isn_'_t getting to go and i am very out of pocket !
F	was very impressed and would definitely recommend .
F	but i '_m happy with the products and rajapack i '_ve always replied to my emails promptly .
M	website easy to navigate and find the right part - delivered quickly - videos show how to make repairs .
M	firstly to get the car sold and of the forcourt .
M	i am not surprised there are so many bad_reviews here .
M	so obvious problems with their ordering system .
M	all in all i would definitely use jokers_masquerade again .
M	website is not too easy to navigate , but the ordering is relatively simple .
F	update based on response ;
F	i emailed thierry muglar who stated the perfume should be pink and any other colour must be a fake and i should only buy from their registered stockists .
F	we then rang up and the prices were actually £_00 more .
F	they stated they never received my returns - however , i do not believe they never received it .
F	have always been happy with freshcig very prompt delivery and products usually spot_on .
F	transaction was easy and money was a bonus
F	i have used this type of service before but not this company and i would be very hard_pushed to go there again
M	we prepaid the car and thought everything was fine .
F	they were sent out very promptly and the company made every effort to have me at home ready for the delivery .
M	i paid £ 0 . 00 to insure the phone , but this was my choice and i '_m glad i did it .
M	perhaps j lewis is resting on it '_s laurels , that can '_t last_forever !
M	i quickly realised and emailed them .
F	compared with trailfinders and other similar providers they could do with a wider_range of experience and a more personable service however i suppose you get what you pay for and they are cheap !
M	saturday came , text from delivery company ( yodel ) telling_me my delivery was out on a van and the times it would arrive by , and yes surprise_surprise a knock at the door and my order was delivered , then the phone rang and it was homebase saying my order would be delivered !
M	when speaking to staff on the phone they are always friendly and helpful and i can say , hand on heart , that guitarguitar . co . uk offer the best service from an on - line retailer that i have ever used .
F	such a shame .
M	this product was just what my laptop needed , simple to install and with a very quick postage , im happy as can be .
F	you could only telephone after 00 . 00hrs and by then it would have been impossible to sort_out .
F	i was expecting a better quality item , better packaging etc .
M	would use again .
F	order placed at 0pm and item was delivered at 0pm next_day . fastest service ive_ever had . good quality and price too
F	delivery is much_faster_than it used to be
F	of course foods are a question of taste but i cannot conceive that anyone would find these chemical , hyper saccharin tasting products nice to consume .
M	the ordering web - site is straight_forward and easy to understand and the service was ounstanding .
M	perhaps its needs to be clear how small the bunch will be .
F	upon_calling i was told that there were ' delays ' and promised delivery would be the following_day and was told i could have a full_refund if not .
F	the box used for the order was rather substandard quality and was coming apart by the time i received my order .
F	the kitchen is very poorly stocked with only the minimum and does not have such items as cooking dishes , a colander .
F	we got a spanish speaker to help us and we found out the so called emergency_number was just a mobile phone turned off .
F	they owe me approx_£_000 from a cancelled order , and i , m finding it extremely difficult to get reimbursed , it is looking like i am going to have to take them to the small claim court to retrieve my money .
M	i tried to pay with 0 different debit_cards unsuccessfully .
M	there tracking was non_existent and when the box arrived it has a large foot print embedded into it where someone has stood on the box .
M	readers i wonder_why ?
M	i am out £_000 with no way of replacing the item !
M	have no_hesitation using this company again .
M	whilst this website seems to have mostly favourable_reviews same cannot be said for all web review sites .
F	i hope i don_'_t have any trouble cancelling the next order .
M	we purchased an adjustable foot_stool which was promptly dispatched .
F	i '_m a shift_worker and thought a mobile tyre_fitting service would be ideal but how wrong could i be .
F	i was thrilled to try out this method of quitting_smoking conventional cigarettes .
F	in fact , we had to park at the hotel for a night then drive to the long_stay car_park in the morning , park the car and get a bus back to the airport , which is exactly_what i wanted to avoid with a 0 . 00 am check in .
F	maybe they do it on purpose so customers end up paying more .
M	could at_least give you 00_% back if nothing to report on car .
M	i made sure i asked_him multiple_times what '_s the catch and whether i will be paying more money per_month than i was at the time ; he answered an emphatic " no !"
M	eyewear customer service excellence .
M	excellent prices and ease of service from this website , i have used before but , although blackcircles part of the deal was excellent they have changed the tyre depot to use to get the tyres_fitted .
F	now i have to decide_whether to take legal_action for the cost of the wc as well as the plumbing costs to replace it .
M	obviously they don_'_t hold stock , they simply try to get their suppliers ' to drop ship .
M	!
M	one order was lost in the post ( i never received it ) i told chaos_cards and under their idiotic rules i was banned .
M	be wary , i '_ll probably cancel my order and order it from the other source who is cheaper .
M	the same emails went back and forth for a few_days and then i got an email_saying it had been despatched anyway just in case i changed my mind when it was on the way . why would i change my mind when i ' d been trying to cancel it !!!
M	update_: i haven_'_t responded to your reply because as stated i '_ve cancelled the order because you are incompetent .
F	this level of service is rare in uk and i applaude you .
F	£_00 !!
F	so the driver sent it back as a duplicate order .
M	web_site was easy to follow and chips came when they said they would
M	i settled on a westfelia tow_bar which was half the price it was on westfelia '_s own web_site .
M	a very good company .
M	- it '_s not that easy to find how to reach them via im live_chat ( try it for yourself )
F	i pointed_out the obvious that you had a driver for the broken down vehicle .
M	great service , helpfull , quick delivery .
F	the jingle stick was of very poor quality and was replaced straight_away .
F	couldn_'_t_believe_how quick and efficient this service is .
F	people need to be warned about this shambolic company . will keep on at them till i either receive my goods or a full_refund
M	the email received from customer_services seems to imply that the fault was somehow mine for not reading the product description .
M	very quick response to questions , even during holidays .
M	so could this be the dying desperation to keep the money in their bank for as long as they can ?
F	still no money !
F	fantastic speedy service highly_recomended
F	box arrived via courier badly_damaged with contents on display .
M	oakland was 0st_class on everything from ordering on line they kept you in the loop all the way to the time off delivery and you cant_knock the quickness of the delivery men would deffantly shop_here again & again & again .
F	don_'_t touch them with a barg pole !!!
F	delivery from company came the next_day .
F	the rest of the tour was good however when it was the end of the day the driver told us the wrong stop number it was finishing at therefore we had to get the underground to meet my son .
F	i ordered £_000 worth of goods .
M	great on products with fantastic service every time .
M	so my advice is simple .
M	the records were in the cheapest white record mailers , and because i bought so many there were no stiffeners , and 0 mailers were taped_together .
M	as i was out and waiting for a call from a friend i needed to get it working so i fiddled and fiddled and tried everything and after about 00mins of pushing this that and the other it came back to life .
M	reasonable prices , options to suit most budgets .
F	the down_side of using this company was the fact that on the day when i was expecting to receive my delivery , i was informed that it would not be delivered until the following_day .
M	had a wide_range of products , i also love the fact that i can simply reserve my item and get a unique reserve code to pick_up the item in store
M	don_'_t write off your local official dealer before getting their best quote .
F	all because this company charge you per min not second .
F	they don_'_t seem to be able to decide where to pitch themselves and with shoes for example they offer cheap synthetic heels then jump to decent leather courts at £_000 !
M	i ordered my item on the thursday and it turned_up friday_morning and was a great quality official product !
M	great service and very fast delivery costume is as_described except it looks as though it has_been worn and returned !!!
M	great service !
F	easy website to use and very fast delivery what more do you need .
F	i stick my face into it and inhale .
F	which is a shame .
M	the best internet transaction i have ever carried_out .
F	extremely disappointed , as my invoice says i did in fact order the correct poster .
F	for i have not as yet received my order .
F	as it was under_£_00 the charge for delivery was £ 0 . 00 , which i felt was a bit_steep but as i needed the mattress asap , was willing to pay .
F	please_accept our apology for this , after chasing the order i have just been informed the fabric you have ordered is currently out of stock and is not due back into us until the 00th of january .
F	love this site , massive_range of alcohol available and brilliant customer service .
F	the cage also had a few bumps on the tray which might of been through the delivery process i think but other than those minor_hiccups i am very happy with my new cage .
M	other than this the turnaround time was good .
F	item as_described , dispatched and delivered quickly , thankyou
M	i e_- mail and ask if there was a problem and the answer is " yeah i changed my mind ".
M	i '_ve now escalated this problem to paypal trying to get my money back but still clubhouse golf are failing to respond .
M	totally_unacceptable
F	they also have a restriction on mineral water_bottles , they are very mean .
F	i recieved a text early the next_morning giving me a 0 hour delivery slot and the driver even phoned when he was 00_mins_away .
F	i ordered some flowers for my sick_friend from this company .
F	they could not tell me why this happened nor why it was not delivered last saturday .
F	excellent
F	this was one if the worse holidays i '_ve ever had completely miss sold it was told a 0_star hotel was more like a 0 my complaint was brushed under the table will never use these again
F	a really high_quality finish & excellent value for money .
F	i always shop around when buying on - line , and have found viovet to be consistently keenly_priced , and i '_ve learnt that i can buy from them with confidence as their service , speed of delivery and product quality are always first_class
F	said the following saturday but i was not willing to pay another extra_charge for a saturday delivery and i wanted a refund of the extra_charge that i had already paid .
M	quick and easy website , with no_hidden cons .
F	i would have liked the web_page to have been uptodate re stock_availability as there are alternative suppliers .
F	there were a few mix_ups . first of all the delivery came after we had closed so i went to pick it up myself , when i got there the front of the t shirts hadn_'_t been printed on , only the backs .
F	the service was quick and i like the quality but the samples are not the same colour as they look on the website .
M	they don_'_t care about customers .
F	i ordered around mid_morning a small bouquet .
F	however the hotel as atrocious .
F	booked the night before , was collected the following_day and delivered back to me the day after .
F	the lady_who took my details online and processed my application seemed a little off with me at times almost as though my inexperience when booking travel_insurance inconvenienced her in some way .
M	your phone and value , simple click order request form and envelope ,
M	the only good thing is that it `_s cheap .
F	i was looking for a waterproof chair seat_cover for my mum and found the product i needed easily at care shop .
F	quick delivery - great quality goods
M	when contacting best_western by phone , the service is excellent .
F	i think its best to order lots of clothes at once so that the delivery fee is worth it .
F	would not use them again .
M	no apology , no nothing until after i complained !
M	i understand i could have left an empty_tank , but who takes a chance with travelling on an empty_tank in a foreign_country .
F	the fault with my old one was that the plastic insert had perished & i assume that you have to purchase the whole_thing rather_than a bit of plastic insert .
F	it ’_s a shame i can ’_t say the same about the courier they use ( city_link )!
F	i had been sent two tickets instead of one which didn_'_t really matter to me , but did it mean that someone_else lost out ?
M	the only reason i have marked them down is because of the missing items , the meat received is great though .
F	i '_m_sure with the invoice attached to it .!
F	decided to try eflorist instead of the usual large named company to send to my mum for a birthday surprise .
F	excellent products at great prices .
M	i booked a courier through shiply for a collection from spain to be done whilst i was there for a week .
M	after 0_weeks they still didn_'_t even bother to reply .
M	my suggestion is to avoid this lot .
F	on returning an unsuitable nail colour ( it was not quite the same colour as advertised on the website ) it took just under 0_weeks for customer_services to acknowledge the same .
F	i needed to shift some books i had to make room for some new ones .
F	i was slightly_concerned as i did not know the florist and what their arrangements and service would be like .
F	very dishonest company .
M	call after call after call was rejected and it took 0 days before making contact with some one who just said it was the photo cells and there had been a change in eu legislation and then rang off .
F	so pleased with my tables looks like a new room .
F	the shoes i ordered were meant to be white but were a horrible cream colour , then i had to pay recorded post to return them . so not very happy
F	ridiculous !
M	software took about 00_minutes to install , but proved to be easy to use and functionally better_than other on - line sites visited .
F	terrible service .
F	this seems wrong , basically implying that unless we chase , the money is going to stay with quidco .
F	the vauxhall garage pulled_out the cd_player , noticed something stuck inside it and pulled_out the object .
M	on purchasing the bass_guitar , the guitar itself was what i wanted and good value , however the included amplifier was not up to the job .
F	i am now assured that it will arrive within 00_hours , so smiles all_round !
M	no responsibility at all .
M	further stress was seen when we found we couldn_'_t be dropped_off anywhere close to the place we booked the travel to ( i had to get a taxi at additional_cost ), there was plenty time for resorthoppa to get in touch with us on this .
M	had product on my head before_lunch on thursday !!
M	was kept up to date on order progress both by email and text .
F	would have preferred to have this pointed_out initially .
M	with eastern holidays in the middle , six days from order the i was walking wearing my new shoes .
M	( slow delivery though )
F	all the removal_companies were professional and websites were brilliant so that took my mind off of the troubles of moving .
F	would have appreciated a note on how to wear the belt eg which position in order to maximise effectiveness .
F	i have found excellent bargains on here but ive also been dissappointed with items that appear to be bargfains but are extrosioate in p_&_p . also the packaging that does come tends to be way over sized for the products its carrying so i feel im maybe being charged unessisarily .
M	i have been a loyal gold member for 0 years and have spent almost £ 0000 in that time .
F	and very important at reasonable_prices .
F	overall now that we know what to do we will_definately use the service again , but it could be greatly_improved by clear airport signs especially for first time edinburgh_airport users :)
M	i did this , saved the tenner and got my headphones within 0 days ( 0 days early over the festive_season ).
M	they use a sneaky low price to get your domain business ,
F	unbelievable !
M	so_far , so good ; i received a few emails_telling of the progress and finally a very specific delivery window – 00 . 00 to 00 . 00 .
M	added 00th_march_0000 - i really hope that my grip arrives as per the update from them below and i am happy with it .
F	we measured all our ushers for their waistcoats and every one of them we ordered came up a size smaller and so non fitted , we were able to shuffle round and order more but its been a nightmare to be hones . very unhappy customer
M	they say their website made me aware of this but i didn_'_t read as was in a hurry to book and didn_'_t think_twice that insurance wouldn_'_t cover damage , after all , there '_s only 0 things you want to be covered for - loss and damage .
F	having said all that , we had a really good time , enjoyed it very much .
M	this is the last time i will deal with them or the far_east again as i would rather pay extra from a uk company .
F	they do not return goods , and have a non exsistent public policy as to what is deemed acceptable and what is not .
F	a great selection to choose from and the promise of fast delivery made me decide to place my order .
M	i never recieved the items and couldnt contact anyone at the company by email or phone .
M	fira inspector agreed , but even the new filling is poor , ( paid extra for foam filling ).
F	0_days since being advised that goods have been despatched by 0nd_class mail .
F	although he wasnt able to solve the problem due to access issues he gave_us excellent advice and signposting to other agencies .
F	hi all a friend told me about decadentvapours liquid he as been smoking e_liquid for the passed 0 years and i have been smoking e_liquid for the past 0_months i have been trying different liquids out and found that a lot of them are really poor quality and don_'_t taste like the flavor its meant to so that '_s when i asked my friend the best liquid to get and his answer was if you want the best e_liquid in the world decadentvapours is the best place to go but its a bit_pricey anyway i agree it is the best in the world and it is a bit_pricey but at the end of the day you get what you pay for and i love it
F	i didn_'_t expect a large bunch , but these were no better_than a five_pound bunch from my local_store .
M	apparently 0 in stock , maybe they were swamped just before_christmas but recent reviews were showing that deliveries were taking place quickly .
M	to summarise : avoid dell if you value your_sanity .
M	then i decided to stop sending_parcels with interparcel . never ever agein
M	no_problems and quick delivery .
F	this didn_'_t happen .
M	when price is more important than luxury .
F	this is the ultimate company for me . whenever i want something on line amazon are the boys i try first and i am hardly_ever dissappointed . fabulous service from speedy delivery and first_class quality and if anything does happen to go_wrong they fix it very quickly . excellent .
M	very helpful response from sales_team to a query about one , albeit quite a long time ( 00_hours ).
M	!
F	not good .
M	in the third call they complained that they had been " dealing_with a backlog of orders " and were experiencing " problems with our new systems ".
F	have sold a few mobiles to envirofone & every time i have received excellent , fast , efficient service - nothing more to say really !
M	the bag for the phone arrived the next_day and the whe process was completed in a few_days .
M	the new delivery day was only advised on the morning of delivery and it was a little inconvenient as i had to arrange someone to sign for the item in my absence
M	will be getting more gear next year .
F	even better the charging_port now doesnt work !!!
M	so as my phone fitted the criteria was confused why reduced by £_00 so called and spoke to a gentlemen at zoomfish who then stated i should read further down to subheading 0 . 0 which then states
F	also material very scratchy !!
F	i '_ve_used carphone_warehouse for several_years_now either for phones or accessories and overall they are ok .
M	i have now sent 0 phones to maxima on different occasions
F	good communication and flowers were nice but were covered in the paper and being a funeral nothing could be done .
F	they take 0 - 0_weeks to refund you if they loose or damage your parcel , that is if your lucky_enough to get your money back !
F	i then received an_email 00 days ago saying someone would be in touch in 0_days , still no phone_call , email or letter .
M	either way , i wouldn_'_t ever shop with them again , truly_terrible company .
F	i presume by new potential_customers . who are obviously more important , as they are generating more money .
F	we have booked the royal_albert_hall and wanted to make a mini_break out of the whole_experience .
F	i have used ebay before to buy quite a few items but my use of ebay has tailed off recently .
M	ordered mother '_s day flowers and paid extra £_00 to make it large .
M	it did not arrive until thursday .
F	next_day at 0 . 00 i received an_email_saying the flowers were being prepared .
F	supplement wearhouse is one of the best sites for researching as well as purchasing supplements for your workout needs .
M	avoid if you do not wish to be left in freezing_cold_weather for non_existant transportation .
F	even_though you offer the best prices compared to other_websites , you do not seem to acknowledge your frequent customers .
M	staff were friendly
F	i asked to speak to a supervisor and after hanging on for a long while got through to a supervisor in india .
F	can '_t help wondering how hard it can be to cut me a bit .
F	got a great service from them , delivered the next_day and great quality shorts .
M	every other aspect about the order was first_class . cannot_fault it at all .
M	i emailed them to change the size , which they promptly did .
M	so my daughter will_certainly not be spending her money with them .
M	no_complaints .
F	in the end despite simply repeatedly thanking_me for my patience which by now was in very short supply , i cancelled the order and bought my lens elsewhere .
M	i ordered a rubydry dehumidifier wednesdy evening it arrived on friday as promised .
M	paypal is extremely unhelpful in dealing_with customers and blocks their payments with no justifiable reason .
M	deliveries always arrive when promised and prices are the best i could_find on the net .
F	this went on & on even_though my email was very clear that i needed two more springs .
F	y
M	a +
F	luckily someone spotted it on a doorstep and realised who it was for and after checking with my in - laws went back to get it for them .
F	twas when he spoke to the lady on the phone , who didn_'_t have the best english , was obviously just there to answer calls , not to resolve_issues any further than ' it will be with you as soon as possible ' and i don_'_t mean any offence by that .
F	however , some of the items were rejected which was disappointing e . g .
F	fast service , notified by e_mail on every thing , packed good .
M	they answer easy emails and ignore difficult ones !
M	still have had no call or apology , but hey , i guess my custom isn_'_t worth their time after all .
M	i wouldn_'_t be too happy if a single record arrived in that style of mailer with no stiffener , but this was decently_packaged and everything was undamaged .
M	highly_recommended .
M	they arrived at our door via_ups on the wednesday_morning !
F	i think the principle of the support is good just need to get the sizing right .
M	also seem reasonably_priced ( though that '_s not my primary_reason for choosing them )
F	go elsewhere i did later that evening and the next_day my sister - in - law received a lovely bunch of flowers .
M	i placed an order with golfbase in excess of £_000 , i was then contacted by them to say one of the items was not in stock and would be given a refund for that item , i conducted a web search for the item and found it still available in their ebay site .
F	excellent first contact , very helpfull staff , super quick delivery & at a great price . a massive_saving on the same purchace from the vets !
M	purcashed a item from this company and it came without a power_cable and was a different part number then what was advertised .
M	there was a dropped stitch in the seem which was entirely visible .
M	it was not as difficult as we exspected your staff answered all our question s helped through our doubts .
M	i wouldnt recommend this outfit to my own worst enemies they couldnt give a damn about loyalty to customers and they really dont realise that without us they wont continue in business .
M	the only places i could_find them was in america and japan but then i found taunton_leisure online .
M	unfortunately i won_'_t be using them again due to this .
F	one satisfied senior_citizen !"
F	but he lied , they weren_'_t sent 0st_class_post they were sent by courier , knowing full well it would be yet another 0_days till we got them and another 0_days for my 00 - year_old dog to suffer !
F	sadly the tickets didn_'_t arrive and it took a couple of telephone_calls to sort it out .
M	item arrived within 00_hours free of charge !
M	many_thanks .
F	i sent for 0 pairs of leggins in the sale at £ 0 . 00 a pair . the sizes were 00 / 00 and m / l to fit my daughter who is a size 00 , but only one pair was a perfect_fit and another pair fit ok .
F	easy ordering , and very quick delivery as promised .
F	went alright in the end .
M	here '_s to a day taken off work for nothing .
F	we have travelled with most passenger ferry operators but it is never easy getting to europe from scotland or the north of the uk .
F	i know it '_s not worn often but , u are showing it off for that night , everyone looking at u , it needs to be better quality .
M	carphone warheouse under the auspices of mobile . co . uk automatically set_up a subscription to a gadget_helpline which is deducted from your bank_account every six_months to the tune of £_00 . 00 just enough not to notice but a nice little_earner .
M	gig great seats superb sound amazing
F	so after chasing the company who had sent the parcel i contacted the sorting_office and was told that the parcel was awaiting my collection .
M	timely delivery
F	i had 00 year_old mother and her elderly frined with me and we had 0 suitcase and 0 big bags but he didn_'_t even offer to carry one bag .
F	speedy service and delivery .
M	this would be much more beneficial than trying to speak to another member to help with your chosen language that doesn_'_t know your own language .
M	sw '_s shipping rate increases as more items ( weight ) are added .
F	it was not to expensive and arrived to my door much sooner_than i expected it to arrive
M	ordered the part i required at 00 . 00 and did not expect it to arrive the next_day , but arrived first_class post and shower back in operation by 00 : 00 .
M	was pleased with the chair but not so happy that the delivery company could not take the desk as they had not been issued with any paperwork .
M	when i phoned to complain to see if i could change for a lighter laptop ( even to pay the extra again ), they refused even_though the only reason i purchased the laptop as it was recommended by them .
F	i only use paypal as ebay won_'_t allow me to use anything_else !
M	telephoned and was told paying line rental upfront was not an option on the internet but this could be done over the telephone .
F	thrilled that i can order my favourite items , but so dissapointed by the continued delayed delivery .
M	i found zero evidence that it does this , and found a few scientific papers to the contrary .
F	can recommend the service .
F	ive been a customer for a few_months now .
M	up came shower_doctor and with a bit of investigation , saw that they not only stocked the part , but had a video on how to fit it .
F	she then went on to say she checked the drivers tracker ( in his body ?
M	bargain !
M	also , £_00 for delivery is way too high , only ordered because this was one of the few toilets i could_find that will fit easily into my existing plumbing .
F	discovered them .
M	i had just returned from a 0 - week trip to india , and needed tyres urgently .
M	thank_you very much !
M	i would highly_recommend park_cameras due to their great value , and professional and courteous attitude when dealing_with them .
M	got the goods on tuesday .
M	i have been buying hi . fi and video cables from kenable for sometime and have found their products to be top_class and their delivery times to be second to none .
M	one purchase 0 emails : thank_you for the order , order received , payment processed , order passed to warehouse , goods sent , feedback request , survey . next time we go to a shop .
M	i ordered flowers for my daughter '_s birthday from floraqueen .
F	i placed an order with wood0u on a tuesday , and was kept up to date with news of my items being dispatched .
F	( not including the standard £_00 odd change to policy fee ) so i decided to get quotes from elsewhere .
M	definitely have to expose these criminals .
M	the service provided by this company is first_class .
M	oh and a huge reduction on rrp price .
M	charger is cheaper_elsewhere on the net .
F	because technically i cannot use their on - line shopping facility .
M	now i know why not , terrible customer service .
M	shocking how a company can get away with this , when i could have got a slightly_smaller amount of cashback from a competitor and now i '_m left with nothing .
M	still , i thought it worth trying in case it was the one for me and bought 000 gms , all nicely_packaged by hand by a very pleasant assistant and then came my next shock - the price !
F	i don_'_t like paying £ 0 . 00 for delivery then if you don_'_t like it the same to return , you end up out of pocket with no item .
M	the flowers arrived in immaculate_condition .
F	from the time i decided to sell my phone to receiving the bag and getting the money transferred to my account this was so simple i would highly_recommend x
F	so , i googled ' window_film ' & found purlfrost .
M	at 0000_hrs , i tried to call parcelhero ’_s 0 . 0 pence_per_minute 0000 revenue - share line .
F	demanded refund , but clearly not expecting that to come anytime_soon , nor do i expect to receive any communication about it .
M	i had to telephone and was dealt_with most courteously and efficiently by a serenata employee who arranged it all for me .
F	stay away if you want good quality products and a proper customer service .
F	i wanted a photobook to show my daughter '_s life from birth to now , as an 00th_birthday_present for her .
F	great beanbags , strong fabric , easy site to navigate , good prices , delivery was fast too .
F	i had to insist ( with bosch ) that they express the part to me and indeed the new part arrived the next_day proving the product delivered to me in the first_instance was faulty .
M	yodel , to say that they were going to deliver it ' 0 days hence ' from the phone_call !!!
F	hi ,
M	i decided to buy simplyboradband after some_research , dispite negative_comments on customer service .
M	the service
M	no joy .
M	once again thankyou won_'_t be ordering from anywhere_else again .
F	would highly_recommend cheap_smells to everyone , no cons just a perfect , genuine service , well_done , 0_stars !
F	), superfast delivery , great price and item was packaged well and arrived on a hanger in pristine_condition .
M	at the time of my feedback i had returned an unwanted item after it was delivered and at that time i purchased another ( replacement ) product from the same company .
F	the product i ordered was as expected and it was delivered on time without unnecessary_packaging .
F	i would definitely use the site again and recommend it to others .
F	the card has only a web address or automated telephone_number , this is okay if you can understand what the delivery driver has written down as your parcel ref_number .
M	the very few positive_reviews on this site indicate a company trying but failing to offer customer service , if you are lucky_enough to order something de cuisine have in stock then i am sure they will send it .
M	what more can i say but will_defiantly be using villa_plus again .
M	many sites offering free p_&_p to n . ireland manage to get the goods to you by the 0nd day .
F	communications were excellent , even with an_email letting_me know the hour_slot that the parcel would be delivered .
M	update > re - ordered material with expected availability in 0_weeks .
F	well !
M	parts fitted perfect after hunting at all d i y for part i now know where to look when i need any parts
F	transaction_id_:_0000000
F	very happy with the whole_experience , good communication , good service , good delivery times .
F	blow it . i will now have to order another one for her .
M	i will come shopping here again !
F	glad i didn_'_t order the medium as it would have looked miserly .
F	0 minute google_search .
F	really great prices for our veterinary products , as we all know buying from our own vets can be very expensive .
F	!
M	have used cheap_smells now for a couple of years and everything we have orders has arrived promptly and has_been at_least 00_% less_than the high_street price .
F	this year bought my daughter a watch that she was thrilled with .
M	the service on this sight was fantastic , checked out several sites and fonebank offered the most for my old phone .
F	i asked jo who was head of customer_services and he didn_'_t know ?
F	they emailed to confirm again the day before .
M	and , to make_matters_worse , i have still not received my order .
M	returned the watch to the watch_hut and after many weeks and me sending emails i was told it was being returned .
M	also there was a challenge over the petrol level on return and an argument all for 0 euros .
M	i felt that the quality of this product may have been a little stronger .
M	despite the problems , i would buy from this company again .
F	i didn_'_t think that the places to sign on the paperwork were highlighted very clearly - my accountant actually highlights the area to sign - much_better , as an idea .
F	and to any customer who . s thinking of eating there .
F	geat product .
M	cheapest i found online , nice and easy to buy 0 steps , waited 00 min and coins was in my account , will be back for more
F	an unusual , but precious gift to a lover of the scottish landscape , which has the added_benefit of knowing you are helping to preserve that area for future generations so that it cannot be built on .
F	which i told him i had but he did nothing with it , and he should have sent an e_- mail to another department who have to trawl_through these countless pallets of incoming mail , look out my item and then the refund gets processed but it still takes another 0_days after that to reach me !
M	also , the support_ticket system did not let_me submit a ticket nor register , as the captcha image was not displaying .
F	it was also useful to be given an estimated delivery date ( in fact the blinds arrived a day early , which was fine , and the courier was extremely nice .)
F	i am now going on holiday without it and am now worried it will be dumped on my doorstep for 0_weeks by yodel !
F	if you want shoes in a hurry , order from shoetique !
F	a happy customer !
M	всем рекомендую .
F	stay away from this company and hopefully they will disappear and no_longer rip us all off .
M	after 0 days i again tried to contact bikeinn , suffice to say no reply and no money , paypal had to refund my money in the end . do not buy from bikeinn , i tracked the order , they source on other_sites and sell to you at a profit .
F	took a punt on using the website as it wasn_'_t one i had heard of before but the fact i could pay via_paypal appealed and it was an excellent decision .
M	many_thanks
F	i will definitely be using spartoo again !
F	in this period i have been passed from_pillar to post with different conclusions as to what the problem is .
F	great site
F	dx wouldn_'_t even compensate by gesture of goodwill by refunding my travel expenses incurred by their admission of fault .
F	they said there would be a 00_% charge (£_000 )!!
M	never before have i spoke to customer service agents who argue on the phone then realise they are wrong and try to apologies !!!!
F	thieves they take your money you need to pay 0 to 0 times more and call_center hhhhhhhh no words for their disgusting behavior . lesson never ever go for eon
F	i was and am still upset about the poor service brentford dfs has given to me !!!
F	i have been using them a while now and always deliver pretty happy with them
F	we got an_email 0_days before telling us they ' could not fulfil our request '.
F	i emailed , faxed and phoned but no response other than you can '_t cancel the contract .
F	how_dare you not reply to any of our calls and voicemails .
M	paperwork for return was very efficient and communications were good .
M	i ordered the new olympus tg0 from tekshop and it was the best price i could_find on the web .
F	purchased a cool shirt for the husband by two stoned .
M	but when my glasses eventually arrived , i was very satisfied .
M	we have tried the most_recent offerings and , sorry to say , all of the above still applies .
M	end is a brilliant website with a really good clothing range , it '_s just fedex that let it down for delivery , i would much prefer royal_mail were able to deliver it is much less hassle for redeliveries and picking_up parcels .
F	have to say , that have bought a few pairs of oakleys from this website and have no_complaints so far . good delivery etc . would recommend them and hope you are as satisfied .
M	really great website , massive_selection including hard to find designer labels ( many cheaper_than the high_street ), all products fully described and shown in great detail on model with all the information one would require when buying on - line , fast efficient delivery + free shipping - top site !!!
M	absolutely_disgraceful .
F	after a phone_call to customer_services i was told delivery had been attempted 00 / 00 , i had left a note on the door asking for it to be left with neighbours if i was not home ( no card was left ) and it would now arrive 00 / 00as it had been placed with another courier .
M	very easy to use and find the right battery that l needed , the delivery was the next_day well recommended
F	excellent prompt service .
M	have asked for a full_refund but don_'_t expect i '_ll get that in the next 0 days .
F	i have now made a claim but have still got no reply .
F	easy to download the software .
F	i received my print within 0_days and it '_s a very professional picture .
M	another thing that i really enjoyed was that they had these packages at checkout $_00 . 00 or $_00 . 00 or $_00 . 00 which all offered different things .
M	they were delivered quickly but found bent , warped and misaligned when opened .
F	flowers broken , not as_described .
F	is it going to be for something all this ???
M	the owner mark went out of his way to put my money in the bank within an_hour of him learning of my problem , i have revised my original review to reflect the good handling albeit late of the person in charge ,
M	i phoned them on monday 00th
M	i '_ve been without a mobile number for one month !
F	and the prices are excellent .
M	but if you were to put the phone on ebay , you ' d get a lot more money .
F	what i didn_'_t like : i didn_'_t really enjoy the meat i ordered .
F	i have decided it '_s too much hassle to bother re - ordering .
M	having said that price is good and one has comfort from it being a reliable_source .
F	i think it could be done more quickly if you could receive the credit against whatever you buy from them in one transaction .
F	i chased the order and was told there had been a delay in production and nothing could be done .
M	these are a bunch of clowns with no idea about prompt reliable customer service or how to perform internet / mail order retail successfully .
M	the booking was non_refundable .
M	in responding to to an e_- mail special_offer the benefit is somewhat nullified by the post and packing charge - not much of an offer is my conclusion .
M	the ideal scenario would have been that the flowers turned_up at my wife '_s work early in the day and they would have been on display on her desk for the day for all to see .
F	hardly the lovely surprise i '_d planned .
F	not the best signs to it from the m0 ( only signs for short_stay ) but either way , not that difficult to find .
F	disappointing .
F	instead of a wooden slat they sent a whole wooden base .
F	i dont_know yet as ive just filled in my form i would like to rate and share opinion when things_happen .
F	did not see the flowers as they were delivered to the funeral but i was told they were very nice and and they gave_me there honest_opinion so will use this florist again no problem and the price was very good as well
F	the site is easy to join , can use on all devices , great selection of games .
M	the website was easy to navigate and products listed in various configurations .
F	it is very heart warming to find one is dealing_with real people who really want to sort_out any_problems .
F	on closer_inspection , however , the t shirts were too short and after a couple of washes on 00 degree wash they had shrunk even more and had gone out of shape .
M	very efficient company component i ordered was delivered next_day i would highly_recommend trading_depot .
M	i rejected it .
F	i get the feeling they want to try to re - deliver this again , this is now no good , the flowers will not be fresh enough and the balloon useless .
M	very friendly and good advice regarding a hornby product .
M	we now have permanent & usable dvd '_s with recordings going back over 00 years .
F	i fiund easy - wellies extremely_helpful and the delivery company excellent with emails giving the exact time of delivery .
M	i reluctantly_agreed , then they later called to say this would apply per person !
M	ideal size for a small family very quiet and easy to use .
F	do not buy from here as you cannot cancel the order if it is incorrect or faulty .
F	i then got a conflicting email_saying they were out of stock when i questioned this they said this was true but when i went on to the website and via other website such as amazon they said they were still in stock and at a cheaper price .
F	manglende information da det_var meget svært at høre .
F	everything has came in excellent order packed great , it took me longer to unpack the board than it did to use it !
F	kept me updated regarding every process of order .
M	0 . : der_er åbenbart også forskelsbehandling på servicen om man betaler med kreditkort / kontant mod at man betaler med_et giftvoucher .
F	the problem is i only chose the frames i did because i thought they would look cool with the blue_tint , so now i '_m left with a pair of glasses i don_'_t really like .
M	delivery company customer service is automated and you cant get saturday delivery or determine day or time of redelivery even_though you have paid for this .
M	if the furniture enters your house faulty they will send out engineers to do repairs .
M	great service , really good product , will shop with you again , thank_you .
F	as far as i can see from the tracking , the camera is currently touring hong_kong , i assume taking some fantastic pictures as it goes .
M	i fully reccomend dry - it - out and the rubydry dehumidifier .
F	!
F	the rug however , i am chuffed with .
M	it '_s a pity some other_companies aren_'_t this good .
F	fab !
F	items as_described , packed well and dispatched quickly .
M	she said it was over the water !
F	the product has only been used once so far and all is ok .
M	before we left i did notice that the meal offered would '_ve cost us £ 0 . 00 each , along with the £_00 theatre_tickets , our so called " deal " should '_ve cost £_00 . 00 . i paid £_00 . 00 !!
F	i have to say i was really impressed with the quality of the fencing and i know a lot of my neighbours admire it , i installed it as soon as it was delivered and because it is pre treated with jackure i have never had to treat it since .
F	it seems like dhl , a worldwide company , lacks a bit in thailand .
F	was it just not ready at the depot to move to the central_london depot ?
M	original review
F	i have been using internet to book my regul ; ar rotation holidays as well as my regul ; ar travel of my family .
F	all_round , good service .
F	i was then worried for the next 0_days as to whether my flowers would arrive .
M	not just rentalcars fault , it seems to be a fixed cartel price through the dealers .
M	it was a very simple website to follow just insert your tyre size etc .
M	simple and easy delivery
M	i entered the email and password i had used with the supplier but this was not accepted .
F	instructions for returning phone were clear and understandable .
M	i ' d been looking out for a light_weight drill driver and impact_driver with a lithium_ion_battery .
F	price and internet service was as expected .
F	a pity but true .
F	i '_m now thinking of contacting_trading_standards as this agency is not fit for purpose !!!
F	i am suppose to have successfully purchased 0 tickets to see the amazing marshall mathers aka eminem on the 00th_july .
M	so as they say buyer_beware if it seems too good to be true .
M	spent £_000 . 00 on a brand_new casio_g_shock which arrived in december .
M	my only complaint is in relation to the various parking levels .
M	the car itself was fine .
M	found what i needed , ordered items and they arrived a few_days_later .
F	excellent customer service , delivery and fitting .
F	ordered flowers for delivery monday .
F	they also have an optional handy ' reminder ' service which you can set to your requirements and subscribe to .
M	let '_s see if my account is refunded in quote : 0 - 0 working_days from 00th of march .
M	i would have liked for them to be delivered simultaneously - saving time , money , and being more environmentally_friendly ( i . e ., less packaging , more efficient transport & delivery ).
M	.
F	i emailed them and they couldn_'_t have been more helpful and best of all , they gave_me , free of charge , no strings_attached a voucher for £_00 valid for one whole year !
F	order taken swiftly and acknowledged by email .
M	give these_guys a call 0st before you buy anywhere !
F	the staff just answered me that this doesn_'_t happen in most_cases , just some cases then tell me if i really want to cancel , i will be partially charged or fined because the company will offer the options for me but if i still want to cancel then it will be my fault .
M	i have used mazuma 0 times now and its the service i always will use !
M	i would have to submit another order to get the item that i wanted .
M	this time though i was disappointed , and it didn_'_t help that all their website said was that my item had been dispatched and i couldn_'_t track it any further .
F	ordering , payment , dispatch and speed of delivery was great but unfortunately the no . 0 sparkler i purchased for my twins 0th_birthday arrived damaged .
M	money refunded on site record
M	i went to the shop and was told they couldn_'_t do it and i had to ring customer_services .
M	they did not look very fresh .
M	i ordered my pc on 0th_january_0000 via the website and it arrived on 00 january_0000 so just outside the 0 week lead time mentioned on their website so not too bad , it came with all the correct components , the oem windows 0 disk and the graphics_card box + drivers so no_problems there !
M	promised in 00_hrs .
F	will not be ordering any time soon !
F	in a matter of 0 minutes my booking was complete !
F	best of all their e_- liquids do n ot have that horrible unnatural taste that some have .
F	prompt delivery service and kept us in touch when they were to deliver
F	will never use them again .
F	i am impressed with the quality and it looks very neat on my rotary_clothes line .
M	i chose small cards and would have preferred the ' cardtown ' logo to be appropriately smaller , less obtrusive and also to be left off the envelope .
M	however , the search_engine drives me a bit crazy .
M	as soon as i '_m able to i will contact the ombudsman and will_continue to try and find out what amount i should have been paying .
M	order received with in 0 day , very pleas with there service ,
M	paymentsense have been double charging me for service charges for 0 months now and still reduce my payments by the service charges which they have already taken !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
M	thanks
F	i want one of those sent a great gift , with an excellent choice on line , just need to change their courier service which really let them down .
F	i found my ideal departure and arrival times - better options than going to the airlines website .
M	firstly , the web_pages showed product as " in stock ", when it was not , which i find unacceptable .
M	album arrived damaged on one corner .
F	dear dad , happy birthday .
M	when i pointed this out , eflorist told me picture was for illustration only .
F	i was kept_informed at each point of delay , the main_reason there were no flowers in the aberden area ,
F	avoid bozowi at all costs , otherwise it will cost you !!!
F	i will_definately be using you again .
M	so , we know the bank of england rate has_been at 0 . 0 % for the last 0 years .
M	suggest they review their price offers .
M	i ordered a swiss grill bbq on line on monday and it arrived on wednesday .
M	wednesday the items that were on back order and the item six_weeks away , arrived .
F	this site is ok for booking_hostels .
M	would not recommend this company to anyone
M	shame that one person spoiled it .
F	around 0 - 0_days after the courier had collected my laptop i had the money in my account .
F	frustrating if you are tempted to withdraw .
F	the wellies themselves were not damaged , but if i had bought them for a gift i would not have been happy with the state of the box !
F	!
F	good range of clothing , and an ok customer service .
F	minutes later this review was removed for ' investigation '.
M	am sending back again this time asking for a full_refund .
M	i queried this charge on the form and he denied it applied to us , and encouraged us to sign quickly .
M	as i wasn_'_t given any alternative , i had to cancel my flights with budgetair .
M	!
M	i declined and have been assured that i will receive a full_refund but apparently this can take " up to two_weeks ".
M	after a week i guessed it hadn_'_t been sent , so i contacted customer_services to request a replacement in time for xmas and was told that i had to wait 00 working ( 00 actual ) days before they would even discuss a replacement ( the game was £_00 and i ' d spent a fortune on 000 games in the previous years ).
F	!
F	there are no_catches with them .
M	only one member of staff dealing_with airside queue .
F	so quick !
M	the post - op care was excellent too .
M	description was complete and accurate . price was very competitive .
F	have purchased a few things from here and would def recommend .
M	my local interlink depot spokesperson has told me that the courier involved , says he went back to the flats yesterday ( 00st_jan ) to investigate and sort_out with the customer but could not gain_access and that the customer was not in - completely false as the customer has_been there since sunday and is still there .
M	because of that i '_ll rate their service 0 .
F	the saving was great and delivery as_described .
M	moved_into a house that was served by these fools end of jan , called to setup new account .
M	poorly_packed with a lot of tape and damaged package .
F	i ordered the 0 - seater futon and struggled to put it together .
F	many_thanks
F	i '_ve_used chemist_direct a few_times so far , and am extremely pleased with the service .
M	was given a refund by shower_doctor without having to ask or have an argument and they got on to courier to make_sure i got delivery the next_day , so was really pleased .
M	the operator told me that in fact my usage showed i ' d need to pay £_00 per_month , so he changed the dd record at their end to this amount .
M	found it , bought it , got it . simples :-)
F	they are very efficient and provide a fast service that can be_relied on .
M	for about £_000 you can get yourself a tuxedo which is alright considering it is between £_00 and £_00 to hire .
M	wish i had known before .
M	we appreciate their professionalising and handwork .
F	my most_recent experience i would give 0_* for as it was brilliant !
F	i decided to email envirophone only to be told i am not receiving the payment until 00 . 00 . 00 , 0_weeks after i started this whole_process .
M	he missed work that needed to be done on our electrical feed which involved unexpected costs .
M	a really good company who offer fair returns for goods bought .
M	unfortunately i realised this too late for a bespoke ring so rang up to see what options i had .
F	the cost was often ridiculous as well .
M	in short , what i would recommend if you are an independent traveler , by all means go to travel_nation and use there travel knowledge to develop a wonderful itinerary .
F	saved 00 months to have this done and only one eye is ok [ not as good as with contacts ] and left eye cannot see distance .
M	i wish i had seen reviews before trying to move .
M	i did opt to send the more_expensive item by special delivery because the information did say they cant accept_responsibility items not received or damaged in transit , and this cost about a fiver .
M	but my opinion has changed because over last 0_weeks i have not had any luck
F	when it arrived , one of the gables was damaged .
M	0 year on i get a letter telling_me that my registration is about to be renewed for £_000 .
F	on the flip side , i have been into my local_store ( basingstoke ) and had mixed service over the time .
M	if you are calling yourself e_- outdoors get your " e " sorted so people don_'_t waste lots of time and effort .
M	so we tried again with a single and double wardrobe .
M	before you buy from curry check online you will get better price 000_%
M	i use serenata whenever i need to send flowers .
M	the range of clothing and the use of less well_known_brands make it an interesting addition to the usual uk_based menswear providers .
F	when it arrived it was just green .
M	strings_direct have a great website .
F	after a bit of discussion they agreed to refund my postage .
F	i telephoned the online number and was told i would receive a telephone_call within 00_mins re the situation .
M	i would recommended flores_tackle to all my fishing friends .
F	excellent !
M	a lot of wasted effort all_round only to find out that a product i ordered was not available .
F	this is a great service .
M	excellent service .
F	never used super drug online before was very easy to use would use again .
F	was very disappointed to be confronted with a £ 0 . 00 booking_fee for using a debit_card , which made the saving only £_00 rather_than £_00 for the £_00 voucher which i bought for £_00 .
M	parcel data received awaiting coll .
F	payment was taken immediately , but did not even receive a confirmation e_- mail of the order .
M	the dimensions were not on the website , rang the helpline and the gentleman while helpful could not find the dimensions either and said he ' d leave instructions to get the information to me and get the dimensions on the website .
M	this kind of short_sighted customer service is crazy and does nothing to inspire me to recommend or use you again .
F	their instructions said on arrival at the airport go to passenger pick_up which was incorrect and they actually meant passesenger drop_off which cause stress and confusion as i went to the wrong place initially .
F	then there '_s vouchers and cashback on everyday shopping items .
F	can '_t recommend this company enough !,
F	feel the quality is very good value for money but we were most upset when the sales_rep was very helpful selecting our £ 0000 order but then was very rude with my wife when she declined the insurance / care package .
M	usually , any issue i have come up against has_been dealt_with quickly and happily .
F	thanks very much .
F	i had to get a magnifying_glass out to read the switches .
F	i wonder_if these companies who you pander to and ensure no one sees the true poor service they provide support your biased unfair website ?
F	had them delivered to a friend in uk who forwarded them to me in france and then i had to return them as they were so awful .
M	?
F	have ordered a few things & some been ok but two not .
M	friday delivery did not arrive , but i had a voicemail from their office at 0000 .
F	conflicting and confusing information given .
M	!
M	0 complaint emails later requesting that they refund the difference_between 0st_class and next_day delivery charge which i think is fair , but this company will not even show the courtesy to reply which says what they think about their customers .
M	i contacted them the following_day and was initially told it hadn_'_t arrived but after giving them the tracking_number they confirmed delivery .
M	i found the guys at amigo to be very friendly and their communication was good however , i did find the process to much more time_consuming than they lead you to believe .
F	delivery : delivery is free to most mainland_uk locations .
F	but , it took until the 00th to arrive .
F	ordered wii and games got the games 0_days before the wii so lucky i purchased before birthday
F	gak - what a fantastic service you provide . great quality products at affordable_prices .
M	a little grievance but my email should have been read properly and responded to !
M	delivery was excellent ( next_day , even_though i had not paid for that ) but overall it is expensive ; i paid the equivalent of about £_00 per unit but i have seen similar units for £_00 [_link_] and £_00 [_link ].
F	the pelvic toner was faulty .
F	virtually knew what we wanted in the french_farmhouse range and had gone to milton_keynes branch for a final choice .
F	then my order didn_'_t arrive , so i called customer service and they told me that a product was out of stock .
M	this was clearly not the case , as i was informed by the attendant that all cars are from the same fleet .
M	when i asked if this didn_'_t damage them , he said " often , yes ".
M	trophy_store had a good selection at prices my small club ( limited funds etc ) could_afford .
F	they were collected by a man in a plain_white van , who said he had no paperwork for anything for me to sign .
M	overall a very good experience .
F	my parents never left their property all day .
M	unfortunately the item i ordered was the wrong_size .
M	only god_knows when ill get the others .
M	i was not there when it was supposed to have been delivered - my problem .
F	i have had three cases so far this week were goods were no_longer available even_though payment was made , i have also waited day '_s for confirmation of shipping
F	only luck would have it someone in , as i had made arrangements to go out , got email to say would be delivered and fortunately my husband was at home sick !
M	will be my first point of call for future needs .
F	easy to purchase , delivery really quickly and at a great prince .
M	but in the end my product reaches safe to me .
M	this site is the best i used instagamepoints and got scammed paid but never recieved code but this site is awesome
M	autoglass really messed me around with the booking to fit a replacement screen after they were unable to repair my windscreen ( a small " star " crack in my windscreen caused_by a stone ).
M	i would definitely order from atlantic_shopping again .
M	the service i received could only be described as a0
M	had some good bargains from cash_generators online store , really like the free_postage promos they have from time to time and the quality of the goods is very good for 0nd_hand .
M	they seem to fail to understand that self - employed people cannot_afford to stay at home all day for something not to arrive as they are not able to be out earning .
M	delivered quickly but marks on the cajon make me think this has already been used .
F	i really wanted the two items for a particular event in may but that did not happen .
M	i was happy to see that i could prganise the holiday , flights and everything else possible through travel replublic .
F	i also am left having to buy a uk battery_charger to be able to use the camera .
M	i have fitted dozens of these from different_manufacturers many for less money , i '_m not convinced this is the best for the money .
M	i bought a moon gem 0 . 0 usb rear_light and i have no_reservations and recommend this company to anyone !
F	physio_supplies provided an excellent service .
F	i ordered a variety of glasses from drinkstuff all of which i loved however unfortunately one arrived broken .
M	get the paperwork better i . e .
M	very quick_turnaround , helpful and communicative staff and exceptionally fast delivery after dispatch .
M	she said she could take details of the complaint and a manager would ring me back within 00_hours .
F	i used the quicker delivery service as strap was needed urgently .
M	i feel as though the frontline customer_care let olotels down .
F	!
M	brilliant
F	no delivery !!!!!!!!
F	then got another call saying parts was damaged so couldnt now be delivered till saturday .
M	refund not yet made .?( 00 / 0 / 00 ).
M	looked like it had been parked at a cement works for black cement !
M	this winter the boiler started losing pressure .
M	!
F	this i could have got locally !!
F	i now had a 00 month_contract and a tv package i did not want .
M	i booked a car and made a point of hiring a child_seat for my 0 year_old daughter .
M	this is the second time that i '_ve_used appliances_online .
M	only a table_tennis net , but same day despatch , next_day delivery , perfect online tracking and delivered in the one hour_slot promised .
F	shower_spares came up to that mark .
M	i am very satisfied .
F	i would recommend this company every time
M	fastlec
M	i am so frustrated by their useless customer service who cannot deal with the problem or send any kind of specific reply to emails .
F	have used this company before and wasn_'_t disappointed .
F	i received an_email from them asking for a review , i submitted it - and it was sent back to me saying , " i had to remove the prices , as it would confuse customers "?
M	fantastic !
M	obviously you return your car with let '_s say a 0 / 0 of a tank left , if your lucky , it cost the rental company 00_euros to refill but the next customer gets charged 000_euros which is the cost of a full_tank , profit profit profit on top of what it costs to rent in the first place .
F	credit where credits due , people are keen to knock when things go_wrong but they deserve their five_star_rating , will_definately use again , cheers coolshop !
M	just a little surprised on how long it took the courier to deliver from the flowers arriving at newton_abbot at 0 . 00 a . m to reaching the destination at plymouth at 0 . 00 p . m .
M	as it is you are not clear where you are and where you are going .
M	on the plus_side though all other parcels delivered fine , the website is good and the service has_been reliable .
M	use the catalogue to choose your item , then buy on line
F	i would definitely use mazuma again .
M	i think aria is a great company with some fantastic bargains .
F	my case is just to cry .
F	would definitely recommend this company .
F	the price given includes delivery charges so you know the total_cost up front .
F	however , the delivery company that hello_canvas use was awlful !
M	please , i would love to hear you try to defend yourselves .
M	however the postage for this one item cost £ 0 . 00 which i consider to be an extortionate figure .
F	i checked out quite a few on - line stores , but no one offered a better deal on the lens brand i usually wear .
F	i have bought three machines from this company now .
M	had to work .
M	it would be so easy for them to just take my phone and pretend they never received it .
M	could not ask for a more efficient service .
M	went to website , stated in stock , ordered then told it was not in stock as someone must have ordered that second with me (_sic )
F	there is only one party that is fraudulent and that '_s not me !
M	it was downhill from that point on !
F	avoid if you can .
F	i also had to pay for the new grout £_00 wach and would get a refund when they received tge grey back .
M	definately shop around ( don_'_t forget that alienware are owned by dell ).
M	00 / 0 / 00 still no email or flowers what a scammers !!
F	then the attachments for the blinds to the hooks are very flimsy and keep falling_off .
F	i paid for internet , and they couldn_'_t help me get it working .
F	i contacted customer_services who confirmed my order had been recieved so i dont_know what that was all about .
M	product quality was ok but fixing_screws_missing from one box so not checked before dispatch . luckily i had some plugs and screws that i could use but could have been most annoying if i had to go and buy some .
M	compared to others i have tried the process of hiring was hassle_free , quick , and reliable .
M	i will_defiantly use broadband_buyer again !
M	my recent_purchase of an electric_chainsaw was a case in point , i needed one for home use but didnt want to commit to spending too much for occasional light use .
F	easy to navigate the website and it '_s quick delivery , just what you need .
M	i told the assistant that i wished to enter into their complaints_procedure .
F	i would never ever go with this company ever again and cannot stress more strongly than not to believe what offers you are accepted prior to upgrading .
M	the delivery driver had been , left the parcel outside the rear patio_doors ( which we never used during the winter ) and it had been outside for 0 months .
M	i have reported them to nectar
F	we got the call to go and collect my ring .
M	the actual shelving is very good and easy to assemble so all in all pleased with the purchase .
M	i use jk loads and really happy generally .
M	i '_ve_used them several_times successfully and have also recommended them to my clients many_times .
M	the price quoted was not what was recived due to a faulty button , we can '_t be 000_% sure but did not believe the button to be faulty when sent , the phone never had issues when in use .
F	the bouquets were delivered on time and were acceptable though not fantastic , but they were delivered in a water bag without water which_meant they were already drooping by the time they were presented !
M	not so good : villa rather closer to the busy_road than implied , and frequent continual barking of 0 dogs in adjacent property caused a fair_amount of disturbance .
F	as for customer service yes they were speedy at dealing_with my problems and the call_centre was easily_accessible but i '_m still feeling a little deflated by the whole conversation .
F	i am so impressed with the costume and the service received .
M	envirofone is the worst company i have ever had dealings with .
M	rests started to crack and break up .
M	all that seems to good to be true usually is too good to be true .
F	customer service , not sure this company know what it is .
M	needless to say the flowers were delivered within the time and they did look amazing .
F	i love that i '_m not worried_about the amount of time it will take , or the way it will look when it '_s finished .
M	in july they mysteriously stopped taking my dds , unfortunately i did not notice for a few_months but having presumed they would have spent the money in my account .
M	fast and reliable company , good quality cables and great value
M	the inability of the basket to auto update quantities is a big negative .
F	the photo was very difficult to upload to fit he photo frame
F	not helpful in any way , customers service extremely poor as flowers and delivery paid for in full not recieved as requested . however its was to be delivered to wrong door number , nothing was done to resolve the situation at the time enquring . i recieved no flower as a result no clear explaination from the call_center or respond to what happened . very poor service .
M	pretty dissapointed all_round
F	actually they turn out to look quite small on an ear or an adult neck .
F	i disputed the payment with my credit_card company who have now refunded my account .
M	i gather that she has scoffed down the chocolates as well .
F	can not fault the quality of the items i ordered , but was a little annoyed at paying for delivery before half nine in the morning , and the goods not arriving for another hour .
M	recently_purchased a charging dock and a car dock for a samsung_galaxy_s0 , the price was very competative .
M	never again .
F	i used to be a fan of ebay , but not anymore . ebay charges you , paypal charges for the same transaction and there is not even an option to pay by check or money order . additionally , i think there are too many cheap and bad quality products from professional sellers that just destroy the whole idea of ebay .
F	it took over 00_minutes on the phone to tell me that the courier would be an_hour late .
F	when i hadn_'_t received it by the 00th , i contacted both dpd and interparcel who confirmed that it was now at interparcels depot in crawley ( having passed my house in the process !)
F	they did not have to be the same style or brand .
F	i would recommend not buying from this company , and if you do phone them first .
F	i am also glad that i already had a non_slip bath_mat and wall fixed grab_rail by my bath , as i do not feel that i could have used the seat unaided otherwise .
F	i will be back for more .
F	half tempted to just say ' f - it ' because the process had taken so long , i held out and went through the entire thing again .
F	i tried a canvas purchase once before from another_provider - it tooks weeks of chasing and the delivery arrived at_least two months later !!
M	this ruined a birthday surprise .
M	it cost me an additional £_00 . 00 to get it to my customer when i promised .
M	!
F	i have a suggestion where they can shove their priority tickets .
F	it cannot be this hard to get someone to help me ?
M	website is easy to get around and like all the reminder and follow features .
F	even after a phone_call they were unable to e_mail me back to explain_why the money had not been refunded .
M	shame really i think they are a good company just couldn_'_t help me .
F	my grandmother ordered a pair of step ladders in december , the cheque she posts is cashed straight_away , one month after purchase she_receives a letter stating the ladders are not available until the 0nd week on march .
F	i got a few things from here and was overall very pleased !
M	technology is basic but is good / straightforward as you ' d expect so 0 - 0 minutes to book on a collection .
M	would definitely recommend to family and friends .
M	so very poor on resolving issues as you are directed to their help section on the web_site but if you cant find the answer there you will have a very hard time getting to speak with anyone , this is very frustrating .
M	there was dust everywhere , thick in places .
F	tried to do all they asked , in order to register but the process was made practically_impossible .
F	i would not reccomend or use chemist_direct ever again .
F	the taste was nice , very mild , and it is so easy to use .
F	the microwave was due to be delivered between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 on wednesday , it arrived at 00 . 00 .
F	exactly the same as many others , ordered , heard_nothing , got no response . then i wrote on this site . then got a response , agreed on a refund . returned item . heard_nothing again . 0 emails later .,,,,, and again heard_nothing !!!!!!
F	( the usual argos service .)
F	fed_up with promises of ' quick ' deliveries ?
F	few things that could perhaps be improved_upon :
M	also they do not give you any information on who is going to deliver your package or on what type of postage they have sent it by .
F	a few seconds ago
F	i only called up this time to recive my 00_%_off as they sent me a voucher .
M	i bought a 000_ml adidas fair_play for the best online price from a trusted website and the delivery was 0 day earlier_than the estimated time .
M	i like the choices i have while shopping here .
F	too long , i think .
M	when i got to the venue they knew that ticketweb had sold a number of tickets but had not been told who had what seats despite emailing them for the information .
M	i asked where the £_000 had gone and was told very rudely " it '_s in the groupon bank_account and i would not be getting it back " .
M	also the box was damaged , it had been squashed but this may have been responsibility of the courier .
M	can not fault , excellent service .
M	could not have done this on my own as i did not no where to start .
M	i followed the tracking and the item was delivered on tuesday according to records .
M	well_done ‘ paperstone ’, would certainly recommend and would certainly use again .
M	poor customer service negates discounted prices especially at £ 0 . 00 plus per phone_call to them stick to amazon , play or hmv all who have very good service , deal with you correctly ( and respectfully ) and have good prices too .
F	found all the products i wanted for a box of british gifts for a friend living_abroad ( marmite , branston pickle and even her favourite chocolate wulnut whirls ) but found the website pretty cumbersome to use .
M	the lady on the phone was polite and really helped_me understand what tyres i needed to go for .

M	its good for a few smaller parcels or the occasional large parcel , but i can see that there are limits on large_quantities .
F	it was delivered efficiently by royal_mail and i received two texts saying it was on its way and then again when it was delivered .
M	products are perfect and what good value they were , will_definitely use them again and would highly_recommend them to others .
M	phoned hull yesterday , spoke to a very nice man called michael .
F	on day of delivery they called to confirm a four_hour_slot .
F	i am a classic " satisfied_customer " and have no_hesitation in recommending them to friends and family .
M	aside from the easy to use website and good delivery service the price was considerably better_than everyone_else .
F	i have tried to get a refund but that has_been ignored even_though they boast of a 000_% satisfaction_guarantee .
F	quality testing needs to be more stringent , have sent the product back as the mug had a significant hole / pock - mark which effected the whole appearance and feel .
F	when they did this they discovered a fault with the brakes (!
M	as a regular internet buyer , shiply is a great source of the best independent , competitively_priced couriers about .
F	the slats that rang along the length of the table did not sit equally , the space between was different from one end to the other end , they were different_lengths .
M	they have no phone number so you have to wait for an adviser to speak to you online - so they closed the service for the entire day .

F	i ordered 0 coffee machines and only one arrived .
F	i have found the pump dispenser toothpaste increasingly_difficult to obtain in the high_street but this was so easy and successful .
M	they seem to be based in a country with a thick accent and little understanding of english , judging from the number of times i '_ve had to ask for clarification or had to repeat what i '_ve said .
F	my money was taken out of my account within a few_days as they said the things had been despatched - they arrived a month later after much chasing !!

F	animed_direct themselves are a great company and sell animal products at reduced prices ( cheaper_than going to the vets )!
M	now to honest they are great for mot testing , but my car failed and the garage quoted me £_000 to replace a coil spring , not clued on this sort of thing but thankfully i said need to speak to the other half first , got home and phoned an other garage who quoted me £_00 for the same work , sadly this is not the first time they quoted stupid prices , quoted my wife for repair work , and it was not even the problem , which would mean paying twice .

M	tooled_up '_s delivery company seems to be very good at sending text_messages saying they will be delivering the product during a 0 hour period , you wait in and then they do not turn_up .

M	just to add to everyone_else '_s bad_experience and hopefully reinforce the message not to use opodo .
M	it is safely say this company has all the incompetent and ignorant sides of royal_mail which in turn is usually an excellent service provider .
F	thank_you so much , it was just what i was looking for .
M	the service is quick is easy and there are wide_range of quality products .
F	by this point i was so bored with making the book i took my chances and placed the order .

M	we '_ve bought a few items before and always get great service .
F	i have also ' invested ' in some of their ultimate 0000 thread_count bed_linen - yes , a bit_pricey , compared to other options - but absolutely worth the outlay for such fine quality cotton .
M	truly unbelievable , and atrocious , ' so
F	i was very pleased with my order .
M	0 ) sometimes when i looking for some hostels in city i '_m going hostel has a very good rating and comments , but when i '_m coming there it '_s so - so hostel ( nothing special ) so overrated .

F	having bought calendars and photo - books in the past , i was rather disappointed in the quality of this book .
F	in the long run i would say it '_s easier to get a pair done on the high_street though .
F	this means that the date is not the same for the payment every_month .
F	excellent service although i only ordered one item it arrived within a couple of days .

M	no apology , no refund .
F	the packing is great and the postage is speedy .
F	i decided to accept the offer , but was disappointed that the 00_% reduction was not made as promised during the checkout_process .
M	for example the bizarre system they implement with the postage fees and the various levels of sellers which you have to be high up on to be able to even offer * free * postage ?
F	the flowers arrived a day late , and i received no email update as stated in the terms and conditions .
F	i love the tiles they were exactly_what i wanted , they were great value and have transformed my bathroom .

F	arrived at depot ( cambridge service centre ) 0rd_jan_0000 00 : 00

M	i asked for it to be redelivered via internet but also expressed my unhappiness to the post lady the next_day - especially as there was a specific request to leave in my garden .
M	none of the above would have been necessary of course if the on - line interparcel tracking site had accepted the tracking_details provided , and used , by yodel .
M	supposedly she had found , sorted the problem , finalised my account and authorized the refund and informed me this would be in my account within 0 - 0 working_days .

F	selected my options and made my payment .
M	the flowers looked good when they turned_up , presented in the spring bouquet just as they were shown in the picture on the website .

F	now the weather you cannot do anything about , however , information and customer service , that is another matter .
F	i got these tickets on wednesday using a presale code .
F	from reading the other reviews it looks like precious_little one is a company that , if everything goes well , can offer good value but buyer_beware if it doesn_'_t .
F	avoid , avoid , avoid .

M	i used the ' live_chat ' facility on their website to find out where it was and was told that there had been a problem but the screens had been replaced and it was now on it '_s way back .
M	thank_you world bound
F	i found the website really easy to use except the currency rate was all in euro meaning it was difficult to determine what the price was in sterling so possibly listing prices in a few currencies would be better .

M	tnt then said they were never sent the booking .

M	took my car for a new radio for my wife .
F	when i called to say i had received the wrong item ( evn though the delivery note was right ) i found the customer service agent not apologetic and with a dont care attitude .
F	i only received 0 types of bars instead of 0 .
F	i returned the item and was sent a refund by return of post .
M	formal_complaint to be lodged today , as 0 days_later still_waiting on my parcel to be collected cheers interparcel many_thanks !!!!!
F	on a positive_note , the parcel was delivered promptly .
F	i find that theres not enough information on what products they regularly sell , only information on the special_offers
M	i will never use apliances direct again
F	i sent it the same way the phone was sent to me with extra bubble_wrap yet miraculously it arrived with a led fault ?
M	other than that no issues_whatsoever with the company or the service recieved .
F	i paid for eyesential product & received an_automated e_- mail informing_me it was out of stock .

F	i ordered and said for a baby sleeping_bag .

M	short course off - road buggy / car ( s . c .)
F	fab !
F	i found it hard to contact you by telephone .
F	was not given the option to have same day delivery even_though advertised .
F	if it is illegal - then fine .
F	the box was well_wrapped in bubble_wrap and the taps are just what i wanted and the quality as expected .
M	ordering was a doddle and delivery was faster_than a speeding_bullet . look for yourself ?
M	i was naturally quite put out by this as it was way above my budget .
F	arrived quickly and all good , thank_you , very happy .
F	i found winstanleys_pramworld via the search_engine and found the item i required as a pre order . great !
M	i was delighted when the door_bell rang and my order had arrived earlier_than i expected .
F	would highly_recomend and use again !
M	i must_admit to a haglofs habit and castleberg is my preferred choice for any kit i might want .
M	havens gave a generic answer when i told them of city - links mess up .
F	there was only one available of the size which suited me , and which came according to the measurements on the website , but all their other pairs back at the factory were 0 mm smaller in width so i had to compromise and choose another style which i didn_'_t like as much .
M	i would definitely recommend them and use them again :-)
F	disappointing
F	not sure i would use site again .
F	0pm arrives .
M	delivery was reasonably_priced and arrived earlier_than_expected .

M	i '_ll be using them from now on .
M	now i '_ll havet to go get it myself at the local post_office , to to much of a hassle , but the fact that dpd ( or a swedish partner what do i know ) lied about trying to deliver it in order to save themselves some time even_though i paid for the service is pretty annoying .
M	ordered & delivered in very quick time .
F	item purchased was faulty and they deducted a percentage as it had been used . erm how do you discover it is faulty without using !
F	i bought a wedding_ring from diamond_geezer , i was initially a little_concerned with buying online , but the experience was a very positive one with help easily obtainable & a returns_policy if required .
M	on the due date i did this but heard_nothing .

M	the safe is almost inaccessible .
M	so assuming that they would get my order monday_morning i should recieve my monitor on tuesday before 0 00 , i waited all day . for nothing , i sent an email via amazon to pcbuyit asking about the situation on tuesday , saturday now , no response , how ever i did get an email asking me to review them .
M	all_round - excellent . highly_recommended
M	very happy once again with my shoes .
F	great website , excellent staff on the phone and nothing too much_trouble .
F	delivery was nearly a week late and no apology or explanation .
F	i did order with yourselves and paid a lot in postage but unfortunately never arrived in time and had to buy another custom elsewhere .
F	lots of choice , what an attractive website !
F	i would be wary_about ordering any more from them in case it starts the whole emailing / catalogue thing all over again .
F	the produce is of excellent quality .
F	easy to order on line once you '_ve done it once details are saved for next order

M	i was extremely disappointed that my order for my mums_00th never arrived .
F	caught me a bit off - guard but i agreed and did ask if that was a standard fee imposed by 00that i would pay if i called them , to which he said " yes " so i continued .
F	i paid_extra for a sunday delivery also .
M	after suggesting the same item in another colour it was added .
M	they are to completely_different phones yet i got paid for the lesser expensive model .
M	provided all details , dd , name , address , reading but they have been unable to setup my account three_months later .

M	i certainly wont be using eflorist again and i will be telling everyone who will listen to me to avoid them .
F	have used viovet for the second time and is always a straight_forward experience , items delivered well_packed and arrive very quickly .
M	been using them for 0 years_now , and never had a problem !
M	easy to book , would have been nice to be able to find more out , such as what type of oil_filter is used , or a better time than just morning or afternoon so will have to wait and see how it all goes before i can say just how good it is .
F	i placed my order , paid and they delivered , quickly and efficiently . easy .
M	paul
M	only option open was to cut down the side of wrapping with a stanley_knife & cut_off ends to find some workable non lumpy product .
M	meat quality is perfect .
F	the girl was gaffing about on the phone and kept telling_me she had to check something .
F	i have to be honest .
F	good value for money very fast delivery one very happy customer
M	it '_s really rare i am disappointed enough to take valuable time writing a negative_review , but . parcel0go may be fine if your parcel arrives ok but if it does not , then best of luck trying to resolve the problem .
F	item just as_described and great value !
M	i had no idea when it was coming so couldn_'_t make plans to be in or to offer alternative_arrangements .
M	the delay worried me , but everything turned_out well in the end .
F	i found the sales_representative very welcoming and helpful .
M	suggestion : upon order check out ask to tick_boxes about communications preferences .
F	when i pointed_out that i was told last_week that it was definitely going to be in this week he was quite rude and said that it was not their fault that their supplier was out of stock .
F	highly_recommended !
M	alternatively look into buying a sunpass at a supermarket ( eg publix ) and load it up with $_00 as and when .
M	it is a good job i work from home as otherwise i would have had to wait around at home for a non - existent delivery .
M	good price , fast delivery , what '_s not to like ?
F	!

M	00 / 00
M	!
F	but that means nothing for the service .
M	however today i bought iceland kebab meat (£ 0 ) in our local_store , and some pittas and salad and foolishly thought it might be as it appears on the pack .
F	great service thanks !
F	this was my second order , and unlikely to be my last .
M	ordered a nexus_0 tablet which was stated to be in stock on their web - site on dec 0st .
M	file service turn_around is very efficient and most of all the customers are very happy with the remaps .
M	product is ok , but expected the added embroidery to be on all mats , not just the front ones .
M	i wrote back to very customer service and got a call back from a polite lady_who_apologised for the inconvenience , but the only thing she could offer was to arrange another pick_up .
F	no apology , no nothing .
F	the gift_wrapping option is lovely .
F	i liked that .
M	good website one of the best tile shop ones i '_ve seen , good product but delivery was 0 days_later than selected .
M	cannot_fault this !

F	fab service .
F	thank_you for a hassle_free service and my wonderful worktops , will be recommending you to all my friends .
F	the flowers that were delivered weren_'_t as many as in the pictures .
M	terrible customer service department who couldnt care less about long_term customers .
M	received a phone_call when they were half an_hour away , saved them pulling up outside the house and knocking us up .
F	to date ( 00 november ), no flowers have been delivered and i haven_'_t even been contacted by eflorist to explain_why .
M	i have emailed them and they say that the arm has broken due to improper installation - when they were installed in the exact_same geometry as the ones that were there previously !
F	i cannot_believe_how quick and easy it was .
F	i found it frustrating that it was not possible to have any other delivery address other than the cardholder '_s !!!
M	this has_been the fourth and fifth time that yodel have let_me down .
M	you could lose customers .
M	the images on the website were detailed enough to get a good impression of what the glasses looked like .
M	well interlink after the weekend you will be known as interstink as i have been in touch with the company , they have issued a full_refund to me and they have told me they will be taking this further with your selves .
F	for this reason i have changed my star_rating from 0 to 0 .
F	delivery fast and replacement items returned very quickly .
F	my holiday was ruined and we couldn_'_t wait to leave .
M	so i signed_up in the hope i would be able to use a code the website however when i signed onto the site i was no_longer able to receive my welcoming pack :( on to the delivery it was good however the mini shaker i had order was dirty and required a wash before use .
F	my aunt has told me the flowers were beautiful .
M	terrible service , terrible company and avoid at all cost !
M	led self_adhesive tape lights , power_supplies and cables / connectors .
M	manager looked at me like i ' d crawled out of a bin and said " how do i know you just haven_'_t taken the stuff out yourself ."
F	i have ordered from serenata on previous_occasions and have always been very pleased with the flowers delivered , but i am very disappointed with the ocean whisper that i ordered for my mother at a cost of £_00 . 00 they were a very poor bunch of flowers and although i do not expect them to look exactly like the description i do expect there to be some similarity .
F	i found their delivery was speeding to say that there were coming from so far away .
M	couldn_'_t have been a more pleasureable_experience !!
M	on arrival at the car_hire_desk we had to pay €_000 mandatory fuel purchase that included a € 00 service charge , and had to put on a € 0000 deposit on our credit_card .
F	this is what happened next , day of delivery finally arrived and they delivered just 0 bottles , my order was for 00 bottles .
M	i got no response from the customer service on their website .
M	kitchen_appliance centre provided a wide_range of products , all of high_quality .
M	i ordered a product but picked the wrong_size so contacted them and was able to resolve the issue easily with no_complications or delay .
M	in between sails due to roadworks
M	the battery must be included
M	there service is perfect tells when is coming web is easy tell you how much and it the best deals around
F	i thought that maybe currys had sent another parcel and didn_'_t think too much about it .
M	the service is poor and the staff not motivated .
M	would definately recommend them and use in the future
M	saved me a day waiting in .
F	good site , easy to work out how the sign would like and the relevant price .
F	excellent response via chat box after i ordered the wrong amount of tyres .
F	but this time everything seemed to go_wrong .
M	i feel better in myself also as i always thought i looked ugly in glases .
F	bad business avoid .
F	so we are now lfft only with there osterly store and will contion to shop at that store .
M	should be rather called " post sovjet adventure living ".
M	so i took it back to a cpw shop , where the trouble began .
F	i could not say anything detremental about the service jessops provides .
F	will definitely use them again
F	i was kept up to date with the progress of my order and it arrived exactly in the time_slot that i was given
M	they had the lamps i wanted and they were easy to do_business with
F	by friday we still hadn_'_t received it or an_email to confirm it '_s dispatched ( party was on saturday so cutting it fine !)
M	it took an age to get an answer to a simple question so i hung_up and spent time trying to find the answer myself , which i eventually did .
M	your order arrives quickly
F	be careful !
F	you also wrapped a big hamper in a little ribbon which wasn_'_t even tied up properly .
F	fab delivery and the whole_process was super speedy and smooth
F	i want my refund but no one is answering .
M	they don_'_t have their logistic supply chains , thus they don_'_t get a hold of the goods they sell .
M	from the time we got on the plane to head for las vargas via new_york we had a trouble_free holiday .
F	in store prices seem to be confusing and as long as i have my glasses on i will find the bargins .
F	just noticed a review from a customer in denmark , you can send to denmark but you can '_t send within your_own country , bunch of idiots !
F	however , there are no previews on save the date or thank_you cards .
F	the spot_on flea_treatment and drontal_worming_tablets were the best price i could find .
M	it would be very good just to have a log in where all my details are kept and if re booking another hotel at the same time i do not need to enter my details again .
M	this is the second time i have used this company .
M	when combined with the apr for paying over a longer period of time the total_cost can be significant .
M	clothes good shame you forgot about our order for a month
F	ok it was easter inbetween , but it was available in local_stores at the same price , so nothing was actually gained by buying online , this time .
M	for my upgrade i didnt have a larger_bouquet i simply had 0 more flowers separate to the main bunch .
F	order from them if you want a totally random bunch of flowers !
F	i had a phonecall yesterday at 000pm ( courteous at_least ) but due to a computer_glitch my bouquet ( for my mums easter gift ) wouldn_'_t be delivered today ( day before easter_sunday ).
F	delivery is brilliant - very prompt .
F	i took photos of the product before returning the item , call me suspicious .
M	having done the ' bloke thing ' and left everything to the last_minute was absolutely_thrilled to bits when df said they could help get the rings in time .
F	great products but overpriced .
F	after a number of emails , in which i was condescended to quite badly , it turned_out that i had been lied to in the first_instance .
F	this is very different to the persistant contacts from marketing before i decided to purchase the treatment .
M	now , normally , this would be acceptable service - but not after paying extra for same day turnaround , and not after having to chase the company almost every day to get answers on where it was .
M	was told that should be fine no_problems waited in all day thursday no delivery checked web link again same problem postcode not recognised phoned up all i got was should arrive by 0pm latest but with no cat_food left thats not good enough .
F	to top it off i came home today to find yet another letter from credit control threatening court proceedings !?!
M	no sign of taxi .
M	we had one minor_quibble ( shower thermostat was faulty ) we mentioned it at the reception and we were given a refund .
M	this might seem trivial losing out on a £ 0 but it this happens with every customer the company is making a nice little profit .
M	among the best places top shop for shoes in the uk
M	whilst we would be prepared to " live " with bland tasting food , as that '_s easy to remedy at home , we are much more challenged by the packs all tasting as if they are over - cooked .
M	its all fine their end though when they test the line .
F	i can '_t wait to plant them in my first real garden .
M	next_day actually meant up to 0 days .
M	because i think i will then be £_00 . 00 out of pocket with nothing to mount my tv on .
F	i received a text_message on the day of expected delivery , but was disappointed when my goods didn_'_t arrive .
M	strongly recommended !
M	we are now in natal so unlikely to get it before_xmas .
F	under promise and over deliver .
M	for service quality and price i cannot_fault them and would highly_recommend them
M	package was collected ok , but waited in all day , only for the package to arrive just before 0pm !
F	it really ruined it for me .
F	thanks .
F	one was too_big and the other too small even_though they were labelled the same size .
F	i received a text saying that my order had been left_securely at the front of the property .
M	it '_s good to see that they are making lots of money and i think this is evident from the massive and no doubt costly company rebrand exercise .
M	when the website says " box of 0 clamps " i would hope that '_s what i ' d get , not 0 pairs just taped_together and wrapped in plastic .
M	what modern organisation discriminates openly ?
F	never using interflora again !
F	sainsburt here we come .
F	when i went on to the website , it tells_me i can not contact hermes , i must contact the company who send me the parcel .
M	being serious .
M	fhj
F	have used this company for some time to buy prescription_drug for my dog . first a charge for using paypal , then a charge for guaranteed next_day , then a charge for insulated packaging then a hike in product cost meant in two months my bill went up £_00 for a regular purchase . will be using another much much_cheaper company from now on . shame on you viovet getting more like the vets every day
F	i do not live on mainland britain so the chances of me getting to a shop are nonexistent .
F	as a woman of a certain_age who has spent 00 years being hot every night i am looking_forward to better sleep .
F	after ordering an item , i had emails_keeping_me informed of the delivery .
M	nice price , good courier service
M	great service , thank_you .
M	was told they would be with me next_day delivery .
F	when the book arrived , i was delighted , the quality is fantastic and i can '_t wait to see my daughter '_s face when she_opens it for the first time .
F	even_though it took a little_longer due to stock_availability , they arrived promptly after receiving the ' in stock & will dispatch ' notice .
M	the products are as you would expect , but given i specifically paid extra for them to be delivered within 00_hours , had the email confirmation and they didn_'_t arrive ( with no explanation or forewarning ).
F	have used them for a couple of years and will_continue to do so .
F	nice that you get a tracking notification and all recipients have been pleased with their bouquets .
M	i opted for the cheaper rm 0st_class delivery option ( 0 - 0days ) but i recieved an email later in the day telling_me my order had been dispatched and would arrive the very next_day .
M	orderd a berghaus gilet for my wifes christmas_present .
M	great way to run a business .
M	the revised date for the valve delivery was ' wooly ' to say the least .
M	it seems the manufactures don_'_t make the model any more , so why is it still listed as being ' in stock '.
F	a week ( and several_times around with the vacuum ) later and i '_m still finding them .
M	ordered my camera on 00th_april expecting a dispatch within 0 - 0 business days as stated on simply_electronics website .
M	the destination for the flowers was brazil and although they turned_up lovely , they only lasted 0 days .
M	customer service very good
M	!
M	maybe the last time .
F	the quality of the service in terms of ordering online , delivery and timing is excellent .
M	i would recommend shopping with end to anybody .
M	easy contact with chat_function , no_problems with shopping procedures and delivery in time as promised
M	they will sympathise with you but can '_t / won_'_t do much to help .
F	i for one shall be returning to them as a regular customer .
F	when it did not arrive i chased it on 00 november and was told it had been out of stock but had just come in that day .
M	thanks so much .
F	all phone_calls go to a voicemail system , so you can '_t speak to a real_person .
F	easy to navigate and find what i was after .
F	bought this as one of my husbands_birthday_presents as it is retro and he_loves 00 '_s designs .
F	this is definitely not the last time i buy something from urban_industry .
M	i needed a new fire door .
F	jacket & trousers were just like in the photo but the hat was a completely_different item from the photo as well as the shirt & tie not being of the same quality as in the photo .
M	i would definitely recommend using this car_park at edinburgh_airport - saves lots of hassle
M	i got new lenses from contactlenses . co . uk and not only were they a fantastic price they were with me really quick thought being cheap the lenses would not be that good of quality but how wrong was i they we ' re comfy straight off and even after 00_hours still didn_'_t who '_s i was wearing them so much_better_than my old spec_savers ones
F	he received an_email !.
F	i bought the nassau cane furniture for our_conservatory and it looks fantastic just what we were looking for . i can '_t fault the internet garden at all they are brilliant my furniture came before the 0 to 00 days delivery slot and the young_man who delivered it was lovely we will recommend you to all our friends and will use you again thankyou
F	email was responded to by a ' client experience officer ' who explained that ' due to high_demand they were experiencing delays in despatch '.
M	i am still_waiting for my order and the company just refuse to reply or respond .
F	the experience of selling my phone was really easy .
F	i ordered boots which were lovely but did not quite fit .
M	ps my sister angela lewis wants the operation what do you think i should say to her ?
M	simply great value and excellent service .
F	i have had a phew bags and all have been excellent postage was spot_on customer service was spot_on they got back to me soon as with my query can not fault them .
F	the website is good , plenty of outfits for my chosen theme , reasonably_priced , could do with more choice on accessories .
M	answer : ' they are waiting for manual verification which can take 00_hours !'
M	not happy
F	they said it was ' ee company policy ' not to replace phones !
M	very disappointed .
M	will_def_use again .
M	the case was exactly_what i wanted .
F	the company were competent in all areas , from the first telephone_call , to organising the advisors visits .
F	don_'_t get me wrong , i love amazon .
F	the text on the box is all in polish and there is some sort of uk to 0 - pin adapter just thrown in the bag , implying that the power_cable is a 0 - pin and i '_m supposed to use an_adapter to be able to plug it in !
F	would really recommend getting the new_york pass because it is so easy to use , you can beat the queues and therefore see a lot more and it saves you money , we were really please with it
M	they run a separate site with sky high prices to enable them to quote massive_discounts on the main site .
F	only a few yards to go .
M	when i chose a replacement i was invited to either take the tent straight_away or , if i wished , i could go away and think about it and they would deliver it to me later .
M	i then sent them an email asking them to confirm that the order and payment had been cancelled , but received no reply .
M	website was good , but the recommendations to go with the product were flawed .
M	it '_s worth_paying a bit more sometimes to go with tried and trusted and have peace of mind rather_than use some scammers .
F	we shall_certainly use your company again .
M	purchased aqualisa digital shower and bath / basin_tap sets .
M	my wife went from edingburgh to amsterdam , by sleazy jet the cost came out at over £_000 for a cheap seat !
F	wrong len '_s fitted so i am_currently_waiting to return the glasses to have them changed so i am able to see !!
M	still_waiting for the item to arrive ?
M	dear god !
M	therefore i '_ve canceled my subscription .
M	i then sent him a reminder on the 00th .
F	they keep you up to date on your parcel status and you can also track your order online .
F	hello
M	how can i do that !
M	sold non working samsung_galaxy_note for £_00 , then got email_saying that engineers had valued it at £_00 !!!
M	!
M	i ordered the christmas flowers for my wife - red_roses and red lilies in the grandisimo .
F	i am so happy with the bean_bag i ordered for my teenage_son .
M	this must be the worst website on the net . they can never find the things you are looking for . if , for example , you were looking for blackpool tower the website would come_back and ask you which town that was in and other equally innane questions .
F	i had a great experience buying my prom_dress .
F	i ended_up having to phone to sort_out the problem .
F	the information came through and the whole_process worked very well , both leaving for our holiday and on our return
M	as the glasses were for a present i was unsure of the lens colour so i phoned the call_centre who gave_me the best option for returns as well as offering me a 00_%_discount .
F	very speedy and helpful service from staff .
F	i was pleased with how easy the site was to use and how easy it was to complete the section with the prescription .
F	so much so he thought that i had consulted with his fiancee which i hadn_'_t !
F	if you are going to do geographical puzzles , get the geography right and don_'_t just send out faulty goods with a correction note !
F	my 0 dogs benefit hugely .
M	please respond to this note an keep me in the loop as to the outcome . i am not wrong !
F	they were sent to me in less 00 days and the glasses are great .
M	they eventually offer me £_00 back , not good enough .
M	i can think of no circumstances where i would use this supplier again .
M	also beware of their points system , it '_s very poorly ran , my account had gone into minus figures , and i had saved numerous points whicheck theh wiped at the end of the year without warning ( it does say in the t &_c '_s but a warning would have been nice .) if ordering from these just make_sure you are 000_% certain with your order before you place it as you can '_t edit an order after paying .
F	it did exactly_what it said would happen each_stage .
M	i bought one just so they would stop ringing me , utter_rubbish from_start to finish .
F	ordered costume friday_afternoon and it was delivered first thing the next_morning
M	stay_away from them if you are a seller cos you will pay pall !
F	not a company i shall deal with again no matter_how easy they make purchasing on - line .
F	i loved the map_feature so we could see which hostel was closest to where we wanted to be .
M	when i phoned customer service was told the order had been cancelled , as id had not been submitted .
M	overall we did enjoy our stay , however there is definitely room for improvement .
F	easy to order , good communication , fast delivery and a good quality product
F	it didnt take long at all for me to get an_email_saying mazuma had received my phone and would be paying the money in that same day !
M	i have recommended them to friends and will_definately_use them again .
M	obviously not too impressed with that which is why i have decided to start paying my account off and shutting it down hopefully by xmas .
M	it '_s great how they can offer to beat everybody_else '_s price by an extra 0 %, that '_s their only forte .
M	prices are superb , and compatibles quality is as good as the original .
M	great price , cheapest i could_find online , well recommended .
F	i would use this company again .
M	keep it up very you have my vote everytime .
F	i would like a full_refund of £_000 . 00 and an_apology , please .
M	i am a member of a large photography forum and people are watching this with interest .
M	thank_you once again flora_queen , you helped make this difficult transition in our_lives easier and the beautiful_flowers helped make our family '_s day a little_bit brighter .
F	good website and clear_instructions but . big problems at your garage on marsh lane in preston where i went to enquire_about a replacement tyre today .
M	battery_force will get my custom for all batteries and bulbs from now on .
M	the box of that game was right , but cd was wrong .
M	finally , 00 days_later , olotels send me an email_saying ' i checked into the hotel , and as a result , i will be charged in full '.
F	order was delivered quickly and all items were a good price , but one of the boxes was very torn and damaged and it was a gift . as the items were protected and sellotaped down with bubble_wrap it was obviously already damaged when wrapped , so a little disappointed but was too late to get another so i will have to explain it was damaged in transit .
M	0st - that '_s a lie because i work at a garage and there '_s always people around who can call me .
M	the excuses , a glitch in the stock system is their explanation .
F	every time i call i '_m told something different .
F	in any case , it has made me rethink my constant use of them .
F	placed order on sunday_evening and was delivered in a one hour timed delivery slot on tuesday .
M	they should all be put out of business asap due to their total_lack of honesty and integrity .
M	was on a fixed one year contract for electric .
M	thanks
F	no_complaints at all .
F	would definitely use again !
M	consistently rubbish at everything they do .
M	they told me a week_later they were awaiting a part and the phone would be with me by the end of the week .
M	secondly they give you only 00 days to return the item ( which could be a problem if you are away ) instead of the legally allowed 0_weeks .
F	not impressed .
M	i ws particularly in the personal e_- mail i received updating me on the status of the delivery and giving me the option to wait for certain items or receive two deliveries .
M	mostly the service is excellent and i have used the site on numerous_occasions .
F	i have purchased a lots products for presents knowing that i '_m going to get great value .
F	i ordered on line having spotted the website whilst looking for the number of a local_florist .
F	every time i wear an item i '_ve purchased online from jules_b i get so many comments .
M	and thats where they are identical to other uk companies .
F	disappointed !!!!!
F	well folks , if you work in law , where there '_s a total denial you '_ll get a straight answer .
F	apart_from the excess packing , far too much for my green bid , it was exactly_what i expected .
F	considering overall cost would have thought these relatively minor_issues should never occur .
F	was kept well informed regarding delivery which i found excellent .
M	seriously save_yourself the money and time and get yourself to a local_dealer to get one fitted .
F	love my watch , it '_s beautiful .
M	but having mixed my first drink i can '_t fault either the mixing or the taste ( strawberry_cream ) and it mixed well with both milk and water .
M	yes £_00 for 00 days . so_far a fantastic company to deal with .
M	won_'_t be using these_cowboys again
F	speedy service from ordering to delivery , would recommend ,
F	00rd_april_0000 , finally got a reply to say it had been passed to finance_dept .
M	the web_page did not provide any dimensions of the item or offered any alternative cover .
F	£_000 . 00p i was delighted .
F	so if they change their transporter it would be all good !
M	this is a great opportunity .
F	as usual ordering was so easy and communication from petmeds
F	very disappointed .
F	after i xhased delivery i then receive different delivery dates from different_departments .
F	0 pouches were ripped and 0 tin lids were crushed .
M	after 0 years our old worktop was starting to look tired and worn .
F	they were a great price , and i even got a discount_code for them .
M	so , in summary , nice stores and nice salesmen , but no support .
M	at the time of writing ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) i still have not received the gift_card .
M	dirt_cheap for designer_sunglasses and they were delivered very quickly
F	0st_class service
M	very prompt and efficient service .
F	but first i emailed them to confirm the delivered to jersey .
M	that reached the back of the case , going down the inside front , bottom and halfway up the bac to the case to the one of the motherboard case fan connectors .
M	i would recomend thius service to anyone who has an old phone lying about .
F	why on earth can '_t the carrier , or the company , notify one by phone or text ?
F	if we had got the upgrade on shore we would not have had the parking nightmare we had just endured .
F	wendy bailey
F	thinking , since uk gov taxes silver 00_% vat , is it not a bad idea to have silver in uk vaults ?
F	i would not be able to deal with them again as i now have no faith in this company .
M	000 offer an excellent service .
M	ryanair . re - think please !
M	it is the most useless service i have ever used .
M	and you got a selection of all type of tyres and the best bit you are given the choice of your nearest_garage to fit you tyres fantastic service and lets_hope the fitting garage delivers just as well to make it a perfect package .
F	haven_'_t these people heard of research ?
F	he pointed_out that the board is damaged in two places , significantly damaged too , a good 0 – 0 inch corner cut_off .
F	on the 0rd , the tracking_system showed that it had been received in birmingham .
M	if you ' re wanting to retrieve the parcel , then you can book a collection of the parcel from your customer .
M	now i have the keys i '_m happy but the wait was inconvenient at the time .
M	my follow_up email asking why they had taken payment blamed sagepay .
F	delivery was on the day we chose , at a good time and quickly unloaded .
F	luckily there was no rain , wind or thieves !
F	i '_ve posted this on the vodafone forum too and the response from the " expert " was to check that my data roaming was off and / or my cellular data .
M	today i got an email reply to question as to where my item is .
F	it is fake .
M	they then took a few_days to reply to my e_- mail about an_alternative .
M	but with the design fault mentioned i would not / will not mount my tv ( 00kg ) on it , without modifications .
F	i had to default on the loan and pay fees so the corrupt company makes more from my poverty .
F	super easy to order and delivered promptly .
M	ordered some tools and saw_blades , had one item missing in the delivery which was responeded to , and resent within hours .
M	kommunikasjonen underveis er_det heller ingenting å si på .
F	i would advise anyone to use dialtosave .
M	i could not get back to the shop so the head_office arranged to have them delivered to my home the next_day .
M	that '_s when i was told that it wasn_'_t full ( it was a darn sight fuller than when i picked it up ) and that i would be charged for a % refill and at double the cost of the petrol , plus_vat .
F	very pleased with my new power_shower .
F	so i emailed again .
M	them : " no we don_'_t have one ."
M	they did everything as agreed , steven made the form_filling foolproof .
F	yet they were holding money from my account .
M	i dont care if i dont get the max broadband_connection , i just want a workable line .
M	i took picture of it and called the head_office they said i need to give it back to the store and they will give me the refund and investigate and i will be sent a goodwill voucher .
M	since buying a case of wine , we have been plagued with calls - as many as 0 a week - from these_people .
M	they now say the parcel has encountered a delay and won_'_t be with me until monday .
F	i like the range of products , and free delivery and returns .
M	it all seems well_packaged , so i '_m happy there .
F	i was very pleased with the decorations , they really added to the atmosphere on the night , and they were great value for money as i '_ll be able to use them again .
F	its so handy as i dont get out much , due to poor health
M	superb quality futon ; very easy to put_together .
M	quality was good too .
M	* in big orange letters then small letters for when you order online at : bla_bla_bla this dose not exactly jump out in your face .
M	the drivers lose about £_000 a month in unpaid work .
F	i have had blinds from here before but the most_recent ones don_'_t seem to match up with the quality of the pervious ones , so i '_m a little disappointed .
F	due to having small children i opted for the mobile service to replace my 0 worn tyres .
F	not ideal if you like me travel with family as the expense of amending possibles little mistakes can cost you loads !!
M	easy to book and a good price .
F	the lace top is cropped which is a major disappointment and the corset is velcro !
M	this company should be forced to close .
F	sorry but thatwas the reason i chose this company , cheque still notarrived after 00 days called again at my expense - no one in accounts and there has_been a problem with some cheques - you may have to wait another 00 days !!!!!!!
M	0 days_later i emailed again saying this time i am going to have the bank_transfers reversed which would be a lot of work for their legal team .
M	at the time of ordering the parts they were " in stock ".
F	it came in 0_days and all looks great . cant_wait for the party , think there will be one excited wee_boy !
F	they sent me an evelope .
M	either way i get one tomorrow .
M	to add_insult to injury they have now charged me for the 0nd year , only 0 months in to the first year .
M	products are incorrectly listed on the website .
F	good to be able to see at a glance what medication you could order .
F	i ordered a pre_- release mug in time for christmas .
F	the breakfasts are fine - the porridge and cereals are good , the lunches are fine but there is hardly_any meat in the soups at all and the dinners are quite tasty but seem to have hardly_any meat in them ( and they are generally meat based curries / stews ) and out of the ' meat ' that is in them 00_% of it is either grissle or fat that i actually need to spit out !
M	it difficult to complete a minnimum order .
F	yes it '_s cheap - yes it works but for someone as impatient as myself , not something i '_m rushing to repeat .
M	your postal_system was crap , my goods wre given to my neighbour , and i will not be using dive_inn for future , unless you can make it more secure .
F	would defo recommend ordering from this site .
M	i would have liked thicker cardboard .
F	no thanks virgin .
F	we have now made 0 separate phone_calls to them on the same matter & in each case have been told that " someone will call you back ".
F	it caused myself and my friends a lot of inconvenience as their pets were needing the treatment urgently while i had to source flea_treatment from other_retailers .
F	went on the website and can '_t even buy the hat at all !
M	also whilst watching_tv they pick_up everything , background sounds and extra little subtleties not normally noticed .
F	they would email once refund made .
F	apart_from that , the house was dusty and not as_described on their website .
F	i sent one through their system which says you will receive a reply within an_hour , and when several hours_later that had not been forthcoming , i emailed them again .
M	done nothing no explanation just an_apology .
M	there are few delays , no long waiting times and the car is looked after safely .
M	within the first six_months of owning this bike i have had to travel over 000_miles to try to sort this bike out in their cheltenham_store , have had parts changed , a useless service carried_out , which would not look at faulty brakes , and a warranty issue with the frame .
M	your paying out system needs to be sorted for quicker payout .
F	tried it on and it was true to its sizing .
M	clearly great craftsmanship in the production of the blind , the company shouldn_'_t be supplying cheap fittings to go with it .
M	bought three bouquets this week for a value of £_00 so really not happy and don_'_t think i will order off serenata again
F	age_partnership were much_quicker off the mark and did an over the phone medical review on us both , explaining everything in easy to follow_instructions .
F	may be too much to ask .
F	i ordered many items , all of which said they were in stock .
F	initially pleased as items arrived well_packed however when i checked the items a week or two later i found 0 out of 00 items ( chocolate shot_glasses ) in a box broken .
F	the fact that there are so many small pieces to put_together to make each part of the building makes it a blind task unless you have previously erected one and would therefore be aware of pitfalls encountered .
M	they offered me another ( more_expensive ) laptop which i paid the extra .
F	the blinds are a good quality & easy to install .
F	so .
M	item delivered next_day after ordering online .
F	i thought the card with the care instructions was excellent with really good information .
M	im tired of online site when they updated after you pay them for something which is out of stock
M	when they were delived instead of following the requested instructions of where the parcel could be left they were returned to the mail sorting_office so had to be collected from there .
M	i placed an order with this joke of a company and recieved a confirmation_email through , then few_days_later they have emailed me saying there is a problem with there payment system and its not gone_through , the money has left my account and there saying they havent got the payment , i think this is a fake company and a scam , ive had to cancel my debit_card as the company has my details , please dont order so you dont have to go through the hassle ive had to go through , items are cheaper in your loocal town anyway ,
M	i would prefer to have elivery time slots available as an option as getting birthday gifts delivered near the end of the day is near pointless
M	phone query on monday_evening .
M	good website overall however but your competitor allow more informations for each house on their website like you can filter by most reduced , most_popular , . you can even when the price has dropped and how much , when was the last sale and how much , how long this house is on the market , the number of views since maketed , as well as the last 00 days number of view , and more important a tool to estimate your house min , max , average ,,, that is a shame all of these usefuls datas to position a house on the market is not included or available to all users in your website .
M	i ' d got a problem of a leading mira_shower , so i did what anyone would do and searched on google for some ideas about what to do .
F	delighted with the back support_belt .
M	as a returning customer i would say that , as ever the specs were great value .
F	the decor was beautiful and views right on the sea front were fabulous .
F	it is detailed as a medium on the packaging too , stating that a small is a 0 - 0 , large is 00 - 00 etc .
M	i am 0 , 00 tall , slim build with 00 - 00 waist and 00 - 00 inner leg .
F	there is also lots of add_ons to the cost , in out case the final price was five times that quoted on argus .
F	the fabric stains if you touch it with dirty hands , i have small children and now matter_how hard you try this happens , and also these are chairs for the breakfast_bar - where you handle food !
M	nothing !
M	flat mesh filter with a circular carbon granule one on fan inlet .
M	would recommend this site to anyone at my golf_club .
M	you will receive your cheque the day after mazuma get your phone .
M	the service at motardinn is just awesome !
M	that said , the transaction process was nice and smooth .
F	the call_centre when i did manage to speak to them briefly just fobbed me off and gave_me the van_drivers mobile number , now i guess its just because he wanted to go home , but the van_driver wont answer his ruddy phone , so they will be getting an earful on the phone first thing in the morning until something has happened .
M	product exactly as_described , despatched promptly and excellent delivery service involving emails , ability to easily change delivery date & finally on delivery day an estimate of delivery time which was spot on .
M	having cancelled the order the item was still sent to me a week_later .
M	why this difference .
F	traveling friday .
M	fittings were a bit_fiddly but got there in the end .
M	very simple and easy and after all its money you would have not got so what is there to loose .
F	flowers delivered on time however i was slightly_disappointed with the arrangement and quantity considering i upgraded to have more flowers .
M	but thats not the best bit . bulk_powders are now running a free delivery promotion . so yes you guessed it . still paying for delivery . shocking !
M	their on line ordering service is easy to use and works well for me .
M	regular e_- mail contact
M	is this yet another ploy to discredit their unhappy_customers ?
M	let_down as the edges of the petals were a bit dry and not completely fresh
M	in the past i '_ve called up to oint this out and have been told that the next time i make an order , the money for the missing record ( s ) will be deducted from my bill , but this has never happened .
F	retailer blamed firstly the weather then my sleeping_bag even_though told them it was fine on the air bed i bought .
F	however , after many emails they quote the phone was never received .
M	have called several_times to order replacements and no one ever calls me back to let_me know what '_s happening .
F	a moment spoilt / lost .
F	ordered it sunday_afternoon and it was delivered just after 00 the next_morning , brilliant service !
M	no issues and a very quick turn_around .
M	searched on e_- bay and found what i wanted at cyclestuffdirect , i ordered and paid , just a couple of days_later my parcel arrived , perfect .
F	recieved my box and sent my laptop the next_day with the free recorded delivery service offered .
M	the traditional 0 course german meal was in fact 0 course with 0 small beers and though the beer allowance was made clear to us straight_away the staff at the restaurant , the fact that we were only having one ( good but small ) meal was not .
F	very disappointed and upset .
M	after looking online for best prices i came_across ffx . co . uk , never_heard of them before but they had a good trust rating .
F	ten days ago they promised to send a replacement box of chocolates .
F	i tried to place an order on line several_times and it wouldn_'_t go through the website .
M	i told_him if the parcel was found to return to my address , he confirmed this would happen .
M	i '_ll be back for more in future .
F	then the miracle :
F	i had a feta salad as being the healthiest option , which was ok , but not the " experience " i had been looking_forward to .
M	timberland - settled for them -- it had two right arms , one bent to be the left one -- could not do a trade - in or exchange -- i gave it a try , but it proved to be uncomfortable -- the staff in the other croydon branch , north end , said they still won_'_t exchange -- had to do what they didn_'_t even try : manipulated them to fit better .
M	the service was spot on with both purchases .
M	it '_s true that their terms and conditions say they can keep your things until you paid , but that doesn_'_t mean you have to pay any amount they ask for in addition to what was quoted .
F	i put in my offer code which they said may not show straight_away but would be applied to my statement .
M	very happy indeed .
F	the mattress arrived in perfect_condition , however it arrived the day after we expected it , with no notice of the late arrival , luckily there was someone available in the house .
M	trust_worthy as ever
M	youmtell them what phone you have , you fill in your details , they send you an envelope , you send the phone off , sit_back , and a cheque pops intob your letterbox a week_later . what could be simpler . its brilliant .
M	i was surprised just how simple the whole_process was , and the speed from posting to payout was fantastic .
F	what more is there to say ?
M	only problem was with delivery date .
M	the back , same as the front , also has a chipped and scored plastic bevel .
F	they used to be brilliant , but feel that you really need to compare their prices before assuming that you are getting a bargain .
F	your ordering system is really easy and straight_forward to use .
F	i use the 00 hour service , which they always keep to .
M	all in all , a very easy purchase .
M	took day of work .
M	along one area of the new laid lawn .

M	if they dident waste so much money on other things and built some masts or what ever u call them . perhaps we could get some good internet signal completely_useless i have galaxy_s0 one of the top phones but useless on vodafone ; was on tmobile and was brill going back asap .
M	the quality is great , but the on - screen preview is not quite what you receive .
F	on one of my previous_orders i paid for the delivery which is usually free , to receive samples of products for potential further_purchases , my order arrived as usual on time , but no sample products arrived .
F	efficient carrier usually same driver delivers at around the same time of day .
M	i designed and ordered them thursday_evening and they were delivered on saturday_morning .
M	as i previous said no real problem and would purchase from them again .
M	easy to use website , good product and prompt delivery .
F	this is not a concept embraced by any bestbathrooms employees .
F	from_start to finish less_than 0_days between sending the phones and receving the money !
F	my recent_purchase resulted_in me not getting what i actually thought i had ordered , on the main page which list all the exercise bikes my model states that it has a 00_kg flywheel the body sculpture bc 0000 indoor racing exercise_bike features a strong frame , large flywheel and adjustable saddle and handlebars .
F	excellent value for money and great service .
F	shutters no_longer shut .
M	and noticed my birds were not looking there best and with the breeding season upon us i didn_'_t want to take any chances ,
M	guess_what , when you try to contact them by phone , their automated service requires you to enter your phone number .
F	i expect if you pay extra for something you as a company should deliver .
F	it did arrive and i asked the delivery man to make_sure the adjustable legs were in order to stop any rocking when opening the door , this was promised , but not done .
F	still , if you want a decent day out go somewhere_else and spend the money on something_else .
F	very helpful people , arranged for courier to deliver the correct item and take away the wrong one , but by now my builder and plumber had wasted five days .
M	i was told that owing to a technical issue it was not going to be delivered that day .
M	in all my dealings with trophy suppliers over the last few_years , this one is simply the best !
F	would recommend kitchen_door workshop !
M	good web_site .
F	on a positive_note the thomas_cook staff were always polite & did their best to help .
M	first time i have used this company . and am really pleased with the speed in obtaining my goods and indeed the quality .
M	all the reservations around the world worked very well .
M	the website is easy to use the options are clear . the cost was very reasonable and it arrived vey quickly .
F	the tickets i wanted were priced at £_00 cheaper each person each leg of journey but not available at purchase .
F	i have lost out on 00 pound , i bought this phone and because the signal wasn_'_t working i bought a new phone ( just thought i had brought the wrong phone for my simcard ) as i have just been informed by you the phone was stolen hence_why it did not work , i do agree with this as i would hate to have my phone stolen and would hope someone would hand it in , but i bought this phone for 00 pound of somebody so not just the person_who '_s phone it is but also i have lost out , would appreciate it if i was the person_who '_s phone it was and will be having very strong words with who sold me the phone !!!
F	the reviews from other customers , added to the description of benefits and outcomes , encouraged me to make several first purchases .
F	we have worked with steven on several_occasions and each time he never_fails to deliver on his promises and always makes us feel_valued as a customer .
M	poor customer service .
M	if it wasn_'_t for showerdoc i may have had to pay much more for this repair .
M	sp they get back to me promising to sort me our , here is email :
M	in february we applied for a mortgage fom woolwich , brand of barclays .
M	the time from order to delivery was exceptionally speedy .
F	i was struggling so decided to apply with clear account , they ask for your internet_banking details , so i researched them before giving g then over .
F	although the order was delivered exactly on time , my colleague received a bouquet of red_roses - not really what i wanted .
F	new fridge_freezer is exactly_what i ordered , very happy customer x
M	completely safe
M	if you work odd hours and cant get to chemists or you need any product that may cause you slight embarrassment to obtain then this service fits_perfectly :-)
M	even if it is not a cost of yours and payable to you i feel all costs should be identified on the booking .
M	i use amazon because it is a big company that i can trust and is generally cheap , but i find it miss - leading when amazon is ' displaying ' a product that they do not sell .
F	the site was easy to use , and the resulting print is very impressive in its quality and detail .
M	the great mobile_phone coverage
M	propert rented with one month of advertising .
F	we waited nearly 0 mins for them to arrive ( having called 00mins before arriving ) they were scruffy and disinterested .
F	from shop experience of very knowledgeable salesman to electronic information given quickly and finally to very helpful delivery team .
M	used next_day service and was delivered at 0pm so you might want to got for timed optional_extra if delivering to work address
F	!
F	have tried all day to contact iflorist , to no_avail !
F	c lamentable d ' attendre presque 0 semaines avant la dates de_la cérémonie pour me dire qu_' il ne me livrerons pas parce qu_' il manque 0 dollars .
M	the bike was well set_up and ready to ride .
F	i saw an add on tv for mazuma_mobile and thought that it seemed too good to be true .
F	would definitely use again and recommend to others .
M	still no answer !
F	i have used surfdome before and found it excellent for swim , beach and ski stuff .
F	let '_s be clear on one thing - i have no_issues in paying for what i owe , none whatsoever .
F	webite is excellent and delivery is perfect .
F	simple , stress_free , trustworthy and really impressive .
M	i was with webs . com before and believe , wix . com are much_better and much more reliable !
F	i then phoned hq_hair who advised that due to low stock the other item would be sent when it became_available .
F	the booking was done easily on line , the fee was competitive and reasonable .
F	unfortunately the size was wrong .
M	complained and told my problem not theirs but gave refund .
F	one arrived , one didn_'_t .
M	service was very good and would recomend serenata to anybody .
M	first i acturely phoned to check items where in stock and got a lot of help on the phone on the items i wanted and how they would sound ( speakers ) and all questions i had where answerd very well i acturely orderd after 0 and i still got my items next_day cant get any better really .
M	on calling back my intention was just to have my hard_drive returned and frankly i wanted nothing more to do with the company but jason saved the day .
F	with best_wishes
F	and you know it '_s not got any nasties in it .
F	as a first - timer i had some reservations_about ordering over - the - counter_medicines online .
M	i found that the rates were the same as before and nothing different .
M	despite my slightly negative_feedback , tyreshopper is the place to go .
M	they have sent me regular_emails to inform that they still have not dispatched my item .
M	for some reason the company then changed it to " not true " with the word " quite " removed .
M	our ordeal went on weeks and then bt had the bare - faced cheek to offer a pithy £ 0 . 00 in compensation .
M	an excellent and easy way to sell your old phone .
M	thank_you for the new and speedy payment option .
F	great service , quick delivery .
M	the frontline i ordered for my cat was nearly_half the price it was in my local boots chemist .
M	forgot to book universal_tickets , flying in a few_days , rang up and was guaranteed overnight delivery .
F	as i live in california it was impossible to make other arrangements for flower delivery that day .
F	nach mehreren beschwerden ueber euroflorists webseite habe_ich bisher noch keine antwort erhalten , warum die_blumen nicht geliefert wurden und wann ich mein geld zurückerhalte .
M	i have to promise to my customers that i will deliver on time so i need to book through a professional service , having tried most of the competition i can say undoubtedly that parcel_monkey is the top of the tree for reliable outstanding service , first and every time !
M	avoid !
F	however , the experience was tainted by the fact that the flowers were dead .
M	the lead - acid sealed 00v 0 . 0 a / h battery that i ordered arrived in a thin " jiffy " type bag which had only a thin layer of bubble_wrap and one terminal of the battery was bent .
F	!
M	they ( or more accurately city_link ) lost my parcel , even_though i had attached a clear , printed address_label sealed under clear packing_tape .
F	the tall chest of drawers i ordered was made of solid pine and looked good .
F	0 of the 0 batteries did not work .
F	not mentioning the very bad coverage
F	this is the place to buy your furniture !
F	over the years this loose_tea has_become increasingly more difficult to buy .
M	animed_direct consistently offer the lowest_prices with fast service and free_postage .
F	the replacement was dealt_with quickly and professionally , however one would expect to be re -_imbursed to some extent for the inconvenience .
F	i will use serentaflowers . com again .
M	it was clearly already opened and one item was missing .
F	this item was delivered fast and was as it was described , i am happy with the walking_stick , i would buy things from this store again as the price was reasonable as well .
M	incredibly they could_find no record of me at all .
F	staff were quite happy to leave me as an unsatisfied customer tied_into a contract which was not that i signed_up to .
M	i picked_up my puppy on the friday with no sign of puppy_food from yourselves .
F	they were great and the kids_loved it !
M	the local rep and local staff were good too ( gardener , pool cleaner and villa cleaner ).
M	my car looks_like it has just come out of the show_room when it has just been cleaned .
M	store said it is not in yet we will ring you .
M	great shopping_experience and followup was excellent .
F	( i can '_t tell for sure , as i '_ve never actually seen him - not even when i '_m at home , awaiting delivery .
F	this is the second order i have placed , no_issues and a fantastic delivery service .
M	i had the car valeted before going on hols .
M	this supplier is fast becoming my first choice because you can guarantee the prices will be rock_bottom and the service excellent .
M	why ?
F	( edinburgh service centre ) 00th_dec_0000 00 : 00
M	took_ages and many many emails to get part refund .
F	absolutely delightful !
F	they looked similar to the picture ordered against , apart_from colour , but that is understandable .
M	very helpful phone conversation to get exact code of the part .
F	absolutely_delighted with the ceiling rose and looked far better_than the 000_% plaster ones that we '_ve seen .
F	good service arrived on time in good condition
M	to which i replied ' well , that is why i ordered it '.
M	oh , and the aerobed double camping mattress is pretty blinding too !!!
M	it arrived way faster_than i expected .
F	i choose the money to go straight_into my bank and i even got a text to tell me the progress of this .
F	to say that i am fuming is putting it mildly !!
M	no date when it was bought .
M	ordered the wrong_size but shoetique manage to switch size for a day with good service .
M	three_days_later i received a termination letter telling_me that as i had applied to a new isp they would now be disconnecting my phone and broadband , even_though i am paid up to date .
M	and for a guaranteed price i would use mazuma every time !
M	awful company .
F	ann zahl
F	i then received an e_mail on the 00th_march to say my order had been dispatched !
M	i haven_'_t had a single useful response from asos , good luck finding their phone number but here is an address to write to :
F	i wasn_'_t in when was delivered so got it redelivered to my place of work , where reception is manned from 0 until 0 .
F	and i love the little chocolate that they send with the batteries !
F	will_definately use again .
F	i live in madrid and have used another chemist who always gets my medication to me in 0 to 0_days .
M	nearly 0_weeks_later my order had still not been sent despite_numerous e_- mails to the customer_support_team and my order having supposedly been raised to ' priority ' status .
F	or so i thought .
M	00_minutes before the end the day we received a call saying that the furniture would not be delivered .
F	it took 0 - 0 hours to get it all concluded , and when i ask for a small gesture , i was told i wasn_'_t entitled any .
F	that is stupid , surely they have no right to use the transfer money as a deposit for anything_else .
F	very disappointing .
M	contacted tyremen .
F	still nothing .
F	top_cash_back are not worth_bothering with they advertise company '_s who don_'_t pay out and all they say is we are looking into this matter or your claim is on ice
M	however when one tyre unexpectedly split after a couple of months their service was fantastic .
F	have investigated company director - he has_been involved with many other_companies - all registered addresses dont exist - like so many others - never refunded
M	not a fast moving company , from my email record , over a week to be dispatched & if my memory serves me correctly then some time before delivery .
M	the only_negative_aspect : they offered the most expensive insurance while the cheaper ones were only mentioned on demand .
F	very happy with this service and will definitely be back again !
F	my son was really upset as he was really looking_forward to wearing this costume to his halloween_party .
M	i '_ve since sought some dummy quotes to test whether i '_ll get value for money anyway or whether i should upgrade but in greece , i '_m being offered only hire deals that include insurance with zero_excess and in usa the quote also came back offering cdw with no excess .
M	recently i '_ve found many sellers charging more for items to cover the incresed fees and often going directly to sellers website is cheaper , or find things much_cheaper_elsewhere .
F	great product , delivered in quick time , perfect_fit , highly_recommended company
M	they were delivered in good time and well_packaged .
M	rang city_link to ask why ?
M	on our return we had to pay £_00 for a hardly noticible scuff on the hubcap which may or may not have been there before we picked_up the car .
F	howver in the last 0 years the prices seem to have increased to an incredible amount
F	no_doubt a man with a size 00 would have found it perfect .
F	postage - outstandingly fast !
M	the service and communication between tdl and myself has_been second to none .
F	people need to trust you to deliver what they order and deliver it on time .
F	j ' ai_fait mes achats sur_le net et payé avec les_frais_de port pour_la france .
F	i have sent a letter which they should receive by monday at the latest , if they do not advise me of a refund i will take this matter up with the local media , i just want my money back please serenata .
F	tried again , got shown the exit again .
M	an excellent response .
M	for the love of god people please stop using myherpes !
F	00th_april - still no sign of the order so sent them an e_- mail asking for status update .
F	my first review had to get my heart out !!!
M	!
F	you '_d think if they knew they had a computer problem and they knew items were not being delivered , they would contact the customer rather then make me stay home all day waiting for an item that wasn_'_t going to be delivered .
M	further to the comments of the furniture_market .
M	i have complained again and now wait to see what eflorist have to say about this .
F	i love the range of glasses available and they ' re such good value .
F	delivery was fast and well packages .
F	ordering is straight_forward and problem free .
F	what is the point of having a telephone_number !
M	parcel arrived on the right day with a 0 , yes 0 hour time_slot .
F	i have made a second order today and have no_doubt the service will be the same .
M	very pleased with the quality of printing and the finished product .
F	on pick_up my baggage was delayed but with constant_communication i was picked_up within five_minutes
F	" unfortunately a manger isn_’_t going to advise you any different , this is a company policy and we all abide by the same rules ."
M	perhaps i was a bit naive .
F	i found the site quite easy to use , delivery was prompt and parcel well_packaged
F	not only were they the wrong ones but the roses were brown on the ends of the petals .
M	i would use wiggle again but only for small items but for now i wait to see how soon my refund is credited .
F	i received confirmation that '_s it would be delivered on 0 / 00 , but on the evening of 0 / 00 i had a phone_call to say that due to a misunderstanding it would be 0 / 00 but promised it would be in time for the wedding .
F	would however be dubious_about buying from here for presents as other goods i bought weren_'_t wrapped in the cellophane wrapper .
M	they are still taking payments from me , despite the customer_services team claiming they aren_'_t .
M	much more reliable
F	tv_channels so restricted ( no viewing card ) that it wasn_'_t worth switching the tv on .
F	we have used virgin for our florida flights quite a few_times - using air miles collected through amex and then xferring them to virgin .
M	ability superstore contacted me and gave_me a full_refund i applaud them vigourously for the attention they gave_me and their politeness . once again thank_you !
F	it '_s a shame that the delivery driver ruining what otherwise would have been a pleasant ordering experience .
F	i ordered from this site after my usual_supplier told me the contact_lenses were unobtainable and did not know when they could provide them .
M	if it could not be repackaged and replaced with the right size it would be nice to be told that rather_than just be ignored .
M	cost £ 0 .
M	everything_went well until i was given an activation date .
F	easy to use website with very competative_prices .
F	kept_updated about when flowers were dispatched and delivered .
M	eventually i was rung with a delivery date for the replacement parts .
F	excellent customer service very friendly .
F	but hopefully my review here can prevent others making the same mistake .
M	all rides thus_far have run_smoothly .
F	my husband and i booked what was supposed to be a two week holiday in portugal , however due to thomas_cook '_s lack of attention to detail and disgraceful lack of staff knowledge , we ended_up in one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed in , in spain !
M	firstly can i say please don_'_t place a review before you have received your goods - all positive_reviews i have read are from customers who have only just placed their orders reviewing the buying stage alone , and not yet given wae_+ a chance to deliver ( or not ).
M	i would recommend .
F	however i will never use wowcher again , nor will i recommend them due to the poor service and when i you request a refund by telephone , letter or email you expect it to be sent !
F	the rightmove upgrade was worth it ( worth £_00 . 00 ), but the additional expense for the credit / reference checks was not worth it .
M	i have had cards pushed through the letterbox when i have been in .
M	when i phoned and told them , i was told they will fit either side as thy are not handed .
M	i have found the online service from feel good contact_lenses to be reliable and trustworthy however i think there is room from improvement when it comes to communicating with customers by telephone .
F	it has certainly helped my dogs itching - thank_you !
M	it '_s cost me enough money in phone_calls .
F	i found the site .
F	phoned customer service , not interested , they have not broken any contract , flowers were sent out .
F	to many emails and offers to take in
F	the deliver had not even waited .
M	was told they had received the order , and the payment and asked did i want the last one ?
M	the whole_process was so clear and easy to use .
M	a bit disappointed with the " speedy " delivery .
M	terrible experience and i would not recommend at all .
F	he sent me an e_mail_confirming this which i passed_onto lastminute who still came back to me and said i would need to pay an additional £_00 . 00 which i refused to do .
F	despite my efforts i nearly ended_up with two phones neither of which where on the correct tariff .
M	used kenable many_times and always seems to have the stock i require .
F	i love collect_plus !
F	i '_m sorry , i know every company has the right to reply to the review , but if they dare , even dare here !
M	ordered an ehiem powerball 000 internal fliter and was sent an aquaball 000 filter .
F	i am as usual not disappointed the dressing_table is solid and looks amazing .
F	i ordered 0 seperate_orders .
F	i have to dash now see you soon bye - bye .
F	i purchased a cross - hatch jacket , which looked very nice .
M	i priced the same item here in ireland and it was twice the price ( that '_s no exageration ).
M	lived_up to my expectations .
F	which is what i will do in future .
F	worth driving to waitrose in thame to shop .
M	more than 00_hours_later , no - one had contacted her so she e_- mailed a further enquiry and received the same message that someone would contact her soon .
M	we were just a bit unlucky .
M	utter madness , purchase cancelled never again wasted 0 week for system upgrade .
M	i am on their mailing_list as well
M	they finally sent the phone back to me on 00th_november , it took them until the 0th_december to refund my money .
F	i returned one unworn , still with tags within 00_hours . to be told by them it was marked and i couldn_'_t have a refund . what the heck there was no mark it was brand_new . awful company refusing to honour their terms and conditions . i will never buy from them again and wished i '_d checked other review sites before buying a lot of people are having problems with figleaves . don_'_t buy from them terrible customer service !
M	they sent my order very quickly and it was all packed carefully so that goods arrived undamaged .
M	slow service will not recommend them or use them again .
F	what happened .
M	my wife did receive the flowers eventually but no thanks to yodel .
F	emailed blinds 0 go and got this :
M	exactly_what we wanted .
M	your web_site was easy to use and as we entered our party date we felt_assured that if there were any_issues with delivery you would call .
F	the service was brilliant . but the glasses i ordered after losing my glasses from vision_express with the same prescription are not as strong so not enjoying reading as much because its a bit of a strain .
F	contact bank .
M	the product was fine but was very disappointed with the service quality here
F	i have emailed them again to ask whether they would like my bank details to transfer the money , but , not surprisingly , i have received no reply .
M	origin ii s0 stand excellent but wasn_'_t delivered next_day so wasted a day off work waiting for it .
M	i told them i already had my shed and they asked if i had ordered two - one with windows and one without windows .
M	however , i want to extend the warranty from 0 year to 0 years but despite_numerous email_exchanges and a phone_call i have still not managed to get a price from cleverboxes .
F	highly_recommend animed .
F	as the ingredients are not listed i won_'_t risk ordering again .
F	well_packaged .
F	it would usually take me around the same time to choose these items in a shop , however this time my shopping_cart was deleted .
F	this is not the case .
M	odd how when i review a cd to cassette adaptor from halfords which not only does not work but wrecks my car stereo into the bargain - the one star_review is not published .
F	buggy £_00 cheaper_than else where arrived by dpd the next_day !
M	however , purchase made through_topcashback some months_ago and according to that platform winterfields have yet to ratify .
M	if you pay by paypal you do not get the instant order confirmation page .
F	comfortable , and were a great price .
M	wanted me to post them proof of my address before processing my order as an " additional security_measure " - and i had to wait 00_mins in their phone queue for the privilege of finding that out .
M	in short it was an acceptable experience and i ' d consider_using them again .
M	ordered over the telephone in the morning of monday , 00th_sept_0000 and received the item before 0 . 00 pm the next_day .
F	unfortunately that would have just left her with a collection of stems … making idiots out of their customers .
M	i was waiting at my departure airport when i received an email to say that my car_hire reservation at my destination airport had been cancelled .
F	maybe because bigger delivery .
F	unfortunately the item i really wanted was no_longer available and the other item did not arrive .
M	we will be purchasing other items from the tokyo_range shortly .
F	i find choosing glasses quite time_consuming and its worth spending the hours when you are in the right frame of mind .
F	only issue is booking charge which is not visible on page .
M	eventually , i contacted them via_email and they said there was a delay in getting stock and my order would be fulfilled when stock was available .
F	the reason i started_using approved food was because of my terrible financial_situation , so when i see how much i '_m supposed to be spending in postage_charges it really puts me off !
F	not very helpful :(
M	they refused to rectify the situation .
F	i am very angry , very tearful and bitterely dissapointed in their disinterest and complete disregard of customer_satisfaction once your money is taken .
M	it '_s as simple as that !
M	will happily shop_here again :)
F	i certainly would not advise anyone to attempt this unless you have a few_days spare and lots of help and patience in abundance !
F	cancelled order and will not order from sainsbury online again .
M	ordered two_pairs and was told they needed more details about my prescription .
F	definitely recommended !
F	the rugs are very thin and flimsy and are not the non_slip which they were advertised to be .
F	very good customer service but not happy about the delivery charge .
M	i couldn_'_t believe it . he hadn_'_t balanced my tyres and he didn_'_t say anything about it before leaving .
F	am really chuffed with it .
F	!
F	in stock appliances were a good price and the only place i could get next_day delivery , which when your fridge_freezer packs in becomes vital not only that it was free next_day delivery !
M	!
F	i was very impressed with the products and their appeal online and pleased with the quality on arrival to be used for my childrens baking parties business .
F	with the other company , the flowers last at_least 0_days before they start going over and most of the time it '_s nearer 0_days .
M	bought a great petzl head_torch , very happy with it .
M	however they accepted the cancellation and refunded the money quickly .
M	i had to cancel my order as it didnt arrive in the time i required .
F	i bought arthri aid from you for my cat '_s arthritis .
F	!
F	many items are often out of stock and finding a store nearby that has all the items you need is often difficult .
F	it was a really quick service and meant that my old phone got me a bit of money even_though it was broken .
F	so thank_you to the florist who put it together walkers in hanley stoke on trent
F	my worst fears were confirmed when the 00kg hold luggage each , which i had paid_extra for , showed on the flybe booking site as 00kg .
F	how may people follow_up on if their flowers have been delivered .
F	having just completed our_newly installed kitchen we decided at the last moment to go for a different worktop for the centre island .
F	update !
M	you have some kind of dodge where you pay no vat .
F	think photoworld would benefit from this option .
M	very good service would use again
F	adjustable saddle and handlebars
F	i bought the transcend ultimate 00gb memory_card for my canon_000d .
M	great gear and prompt delivery
M	when i chased the order they blame the supplier ( their problem not mine ) and they seemed totally_unaware of the fact they had broken their side of the bargain and cost me a day '_s pay into the bargain .
M	does what it says on the tin .
F	i should have heeded my initial instinct .
M	not impressed at all with the flowers .
M	there were many failed_attempts at getting the problem sorted and i got ignored a lot in the process .
F	so yes its the worst service of my life .
M	and instead of apple flavor i receive white chocolate flavor .
F	unfortunately on this occasion we were disappointed by the flower_arrangement sent to our friends funeral : not only did the arrangement appear dehydrated , the lilies were actually wilting and the special message was written in what only can be described as scrawl . very unprofessional .
M	i had received not such a great experience at gak so i enquired through guitarguitar site as the item was showing as out of stock .
F	i also couldnt successfully transfer the account user details to my daughter who is the main payer of the account as vodafone never seems to change the details . then finally after calling them last_week i told them i wanted to cancel one contract totally and have a lower price plan offer on another and they didnt listen to me and gave_me two new set of contracts !
M	if you have similar stories , please share these .
F	it is not worth the hassle of dealing_with them .
M	however , i couldn_'_t believe just how much cardboard and polystyrene is needed for 0 medium_sized pieces of furniture .
F	i logged my complaint on the email link i received and to date no one called back .
M	long waiting times despite nearly empty schedules and the work is too often of questionable quality .
F	do not agree to anything on the phone until you see all their ambiguous terms and conditions or you will be trapped into their 00 month plan .
F	friendly atmosphere , no_pressure_selling , knowledgeable sales people .
F	to think that i had sent these and they are 00_hours old i have purchesed flowers from the market and they knock the flowers you sent to here into fits i shall not be using you again .
M	still_waiting for it all to be replaced a week_later .
M	so , in summary , great value item for the spare_room , but i wouldn_'_t personally recommend it for your lounge .
M	so i looked for something to give them a bit of a boost and that '_s when i found in the cage and avairy your product ( avigold_plus ) i '_ve been using it for a few_days now and i have already noticed a difference .
M	i have bought from sds on several_occasions .
F	very comfortable and a quality product for those wanting a firm mattress ( i personally don_'_t find it too hard at all and think its perfect ) .
M	excellent communication up to and including delivery .
M	otherwise very good ,
F	wish i had read these awful reviews on here before stepping into fv instead of just being sucked in by a great bed offer .
M	we originally went for what we thought were upmarket blinds to compliment the new bathroom we had installed .
M	product was exactly as_described and well_packaged .
M	range of tyres , price and availability great .
M	again the email never arrived , so concerned i rang again , to be told they were out of stock and they will let_me know when they ' re back in , which could be whenever .
F	we have used nationwide before to lease vans and service has_been great .
F	excellent prices , free delivery and received very quickly .
F	i ordered lactol kitten replacement milk on the 00 october and i '_m still_waiting for the order today november 00 .
F	the assistant lied to me twice that i know of so far .
F	there was a delivery hitch which was dealt_with very fast and i was kept_abreast of the process every day .
M	either delayed in postal_system or lost , i do not know but what i do know this has_been charged to my visa account , and i have already paid for same .
F	simple - no_fuss - and very very fast
M	not even remotely close to what i ordered in colour of flowers used with cheaper substitutes used to bulk out the bunch massively .
M	also the rst of the roses were not of a high_standard relating to the price .
F	he followed this by regular phone_calls to us explaining everything carefully .
F	a very good service but i would have liked to order more certificates , i only had a choice of 0 .
F	next_day delivery , perfectly - timed updates for progress of order , advised that delivery would be between a 0 and 0pm - was actually delivery at 0 . 00pm !!!!
M	good variety of parts , but i begin to wonder_if we are becoming a victim of a monopoly , as recently the offers seem less favorable and lbs level of service cannot by the nature of mail order be provided .
M	delivery was in time and i am happy with the price , however the balloon came completely deflated .
F	i ordered a big_boy bean_bag for my daughter for christmas on 0 . 00 . 00 .
F	horrible technical_support , coverage impossible where i live now , no internet_connection but data was being comsumed somehow .
M	and don_'_t get me wrong , i do not think that all bouquets are delivered like this .
M	we also had everything pre_- oiled , which has a longer lead time but saves quite a bit of effort .
F	i says that '_s impossible as my phones been fine but now i can '_t get onto wifi .
F	i was told phone wasnt working when it got to them .
M	the first time they said they were arranging for another supplier to provide the product because they didn_'_t have it in stock .
F	items were as requested so can only suggest the delivery company used is reviewed and maybe changed .
M	00 days for delivery of products .
F	i had them delivered on thursday which was her_birthday , when i went to her house on the sunday i was sad to see that the bouquet was very wilted and almost dead .
F	it was sent to the wrong location and i had to follow it up but when it arrived it was fine .
F	i cannot report on the state of mind of a receiving cat as i don_'_t have one yet !
M	i placed my first order and received the goods by dhl courier here in ireland .
M	as you are always told to shop around we did but found nothing to compare with what we had seen .
F	packaging was great and delivered quickly with updates along the way .
F	fantastic .
M	this is the most unacceptable company i have come_accross .
F	finished the work on friday at 0 . 00pm .
F	over 000 people claimed this deal - that is a lot of £ 0 '_s and i am beginning to wonder_if it was just a big scam .
F	we ended_up chasing a bus that appeared which thankfully stopped .
F	easy to put up but the large width of the blind i got didn_'_t seem to work very well , 0 screws holding the whole blind in place makes it tricky when sliding the blind up and down it seems to come down ok but pushing it back up is a different_story it snagged quite a few_times pulling out of the side tracks and when these are going on windows in student_accommodation its a disaster waiting to happen maybe smaller blinds would work better .
M	yodel has no_problems leaving packages in my back garden when no one is at home , which is usually the case .
M	web_site confusing about delivery didn_'_t give options .
F	i was basically told to like it or lump it there was nothing that they were willing to do to help me .
M	very dissapointing as the free inclusion of the sniper challenge is what made me go for this offer in the first place .
F	part arrived and was well_packaged but was too small although the fittings were right , it was a microwave plate , but by the time i paid postage to get it and then postage to return it it would have been a very expensive microwave plate so i did not return it , it would be better if you could get them through currys at_least you woulx be able to see them , so really i wasted 00 pounds .
F	how much extra have you made through people assuming they can '_t get what they were quoted , and who were panicked into booking for more than advertised in case it went up yet again ?
F	the main annoyance was that one of my flight was canceled by the airline and travel_nation automatically refunded the money on the credit_card i had used to pay the ticket - but that i had canceled since then .
M	they have everything for orlando on there and we used it to buy disney magic your way tickets .
F	trying to sort_out by the website was very time_consuming as they required scans of tickets etc , fine if you have a scanner !
F	they do exactly_what they say they will .
M	and with ticketmaster being an affiliated company you feel that they are block booking their own seats before the public have the chance to buy them and then selling them on at double the price to the customer , who has no option if they want the best seats .
M	ik_heb al jaren lang ervaring met diertotaalservice .
M	goods ordered were cheaper on this site too - will_definitely pay a another visit soon :-)
F	and then it would go to a holding bay . and then !
F	i need not have worried , bought orlando passport tickets , great price , great customer service and quick delivery 0_days ( standard signed for ) yes the seaworld / busch / aquatica is an eticket but having been a few_times before its not a problem going to guest services to swap them for cardboard tickets , ( if you prefer them ), as the queues there are never that long .
F	i went on to this site as my son purchases direct from them regularly , i wanted to get him a little surprise for his_birthday and purchased a voucher online .
F	however the collar did not prevent him from licking or trying to bite his surgery wound and he could easily reach the area rendering the product useless and a waste of money unfortunately .
F	having paid a lot of money for two big bunches , i was horrified to find that neither arrived on the delivery day .
F	fab products with great service and speedy delivery
M	this is the worst company ever !!
M	after_researching the part that i needed on the internet i decided to order from discounted heating .
M	another issue : the website says :
F	i ordered it on the weekend and it came 0 business days_later .
M	would have had an extra £_00 on top of this if i hadn_'_t gone with this company .
F	i can recommend them for all your chemist needs .
M	guitar arrived the following_day and is great , just wish they had let_me know that it hadnt shipped originally so that i didnt sit around waiting for delivery !
F	ordered some flowers for my mum '_s 00th , they never arrived .
M	and why would i want to give this company more of my money in the future .
M	ended_up paying manufacturer to replace a printed circuit_board .
F	i wanted to use this service only for streaming online !
F	the phone charged using alternative charger .
F	!
M	warmer , coffee_machines etc , it wouldn_'_t be so bad , but i found it a very long wait .
M	at the time of travel , i feel ill . understanding the hotel was non_refundable - i contacted the hotel directly to ask if they would be willing to allow the agency ( olotels ) to move the reservation without_penalty .
M	my order was delayed twice .
M	what plonkers chemist_direct are for using a business courier to deliver to domestic customers .
F	i was a little disappointed that the flowers arrived quite late and had been left on the porch , although i had stated that the driver should be patient .
F	a second item was not available but order witheld thus delaying important item .
F	however this email arrived addressed to mrs jill carey when actually my name is mrs jill carey - stuart - i hope that any paperwork prepared by your company includes my carrect name or it '_ll have to be sent back !
F	seems a little silly to publish the process online if you don_'_t follow it . still_waiting for someone to call me back re my telephone query which is now redundant . ah well poor customer service such as this is normal these days it would seem .
F	i ordered my item 00 days ago and has still not arrived .
M	i have e_- mailed to complain but no response .
F	bit_annoying .
M	they would only exchange mattresses if we paid a £_00 handling charge .
F	i am still_waiting and have heard_nothing more than empty_promises and the concert is tonight !!
F	we had been into several travel agencies and felt_pressurised but on speaking to the advisor tina at very cheap holidays she made us feel comfortable from_start to finish .
F	keep_up the good work .
F	unfortunately i developed an allergic_reaction to something within the diet , resulting in an itchy rash on my arms and tops of legs .
M	i sent trading_standards the evans_halshaw checklist where they claimed to had checked the lamps were working .
F	everyone i have spoken to has_been incredibly helpful & friendly .
F	i will definitely use you again - in fact i need to order some more hard_wax oil for another room !
M	please see them to get a real flavor of how i feel about this absolutely_appalling company and its derivatives .
M	never had to claim , but feel re - assured they ' d be on the case .
M	she was delighted .
F	most online purchases have a structured delivery charge dependent on how much you are spending with the company - spend less , pay more delivery , which is acceptable and fair .
F	overall the experience was satisfactory , and i '_d use the service again as long as it remains good value .
F	will definitely use again !
M	the issue i have is that i attempeted to modify my booking so that i could pick my car up from the ferry_terminal instead of the train_station .
M	at this point , i decided enough was enough and asked for a refund .
M	i entered my number into the website so why didn_'_t they pass it on ?
F	well when the first delivery came i was pleasantly_suprised that each item was excellently_packed .
M	i feared the worst and was about to cancel the order when suddenly a dispatch notice arrived in my inbox .
F	this company is a joke , i don_'_t expect to waiting at home all day in case they send it back to the depot station , also the customer service is non_existent .
F	still_waiting for refund and second order . what compounds the issue is i paid nellypot p_&_p and extra £ 0 for what i '_d thought would be a lovely bag !!
F	i wonder what checks wowcher undertake with their merchants to ensure that they are bonfida companies .
F	i found a beautiful display tin , with exactly the same product , for only £_00 . 00 !
F	no such problem with lwwf .
F	delivery great .
M	this has spoilt two of my holidays in the last 00 months .
F	i think it is ridiculous that you have sent me a survey to value my product when i still have not received it
F	it was sent by hdn , the address was on the label and , not the royal_mail .
F	my only very slight gripe is that it would have been nice to have some instructions and spec details to cover things like timer function , bulb replacement etc - the lights the only_thing in the box .
F	" yes , by going through the change of journey option .
F	i '_m amazed this company stays in business with their delivery service .
M	apparently my number wasn_'_t readable because i ' d included spaces between numbers and letters when making the reservation ; but that doesn_'_t stack up as the plate was read without problem on entry and there was no guidance at the reservation stage that this was a critical issue .
M	currently this may take up to 00 working_days ' poor , poor service - avoid at all costs
M	lambda - tek would not accept the return and refused to communicate meaningfully , they would not answer even simple questions .
F	room was comfortable and quiet .
F	we were told we could all fit on the 0am service ( same route ).
M	shocking duisgusting behaviour to just lie about a non attempted delivery .
F	i telephoned wowcher back who advised it was out of their control and if i wanted a refund i could have one .
F	the rubber is really thin and so i don_'_t think they will last very long .
F	so back to bathshop and [_name_] stated that there should be 0 buttons in the lud to lift the seat off .
F	i booked parking on my smartphone and paid with visa_card .
F	speedy delivery .
M	ordered two bouquets of which only one arrived .
M	using collect_+ is also ideal as it bypasses the post_office and have literally walked in and straight of my local shop dropping the parcels off .
M	efficient service and competitive_prices .
M	we booked to tenerife with no_problems it was an excellent hotel .
F	easy site to work around .
F	i have ordered a few things from this site now and have always been pleased with my purchases .
F	my friend appreciated the flowers - a good selection of flowers but some of the heads had broken .
F	extremely pleased , never used the company before - not only would i use again but have recommended to friends .
F	someone needs to be available to sign for the delivery so plan_ahead .
F	request apple to unlock the phone and it '_s up to apple so basically i can be waiting
M	you can only make one booking at a time .
M	00 days passed no sign of delivery , terrible .
M	security / bed good .
M	i . e payg phones .
M	surely they know orders will most_likely get delayed and they even have preformatted emails to explain that .
M	so funds taken , no product , so_far no refund ( which when i do eventually get , will be 00days or something ).
F	i would definitely use this company again .
F	any_issues with a delivery are sorted within a very short_space of time .
M	i sent back the faulty tyre on the monday after my ride and received a replacement in the post by thursday
M	excelent customer service very pleased over all just floorless service .
M	food for thought - pay the extra £ 0 a month or so to get the plan on a better operator .
F	we '_ve also found they add a £ 0 delivery charge on some restaurants , but if you went on the restaurants own website and ordered through there delivery is free for the same order value .
F	invested a fair_amount of time in " repairing " a newly purchased piece of clothing and am quite disappointed .
M	they understood our business requirements they were very keen to provide excellent customer service from the outset and mangaed to turn the whole_thing around in just a few_days .
F	thanks to mr kwame i didn_'_t have to waste another day waiting for nothing .
M	i '_ll be back for some more very soon .
M	not out for delivery as expected ?
F	i did explain on my reply that the flowers from the alternative source had been kept and even after a journey of 000_miles and 0_days of being in completely the wrong environment were still fresher than the dreadful arrangement delivered by their agent .
F	i think not , and if i didn_'_t notice it why did it matter so much for re selling it at their end ??
F	they have taken the money from my credit_card , but i have heard_nothing from them since and no goods have been delivered ( now 00 / 0 / 00 ).
M	the light_weight camping cooking equipment is fantastic , the price is brilliant compared to the us and japanese equivalent .
F	all good value and delivered on time - can '_t be_faulted
F	on opening black baubles lots were marked with silver discoloration .
M	x
M	el ahorro de dinero es_muy interesante y_la_calidad es la misma que comprandolo en tienda .
F	good communication and delivery as promised .
M	so stylish , so comfy , so cool .
M	ordered rebel0 snap back , arrived promptly within a few_days and well_packaged .
F	", he suggested i take it to a specialist !
M	suffice to say i won_'_t be using them again - too many competitors offering excellent customer service .
M	!
F	it '_s a great way to get_rid of dvd '_s and cd '_s that were sitting on my self but prices were a bit low .
M	which means that when you upload an image , you can '_t get the direct link of it , that means that you can '_t upload any files you want ( which is really stupid ) etc .
F	i '_ll be back for more .
F	knew i should have ordered from john_lewis in the first place .
M	they did then arrive the next_day but by then i was disappointed with the service and won_'_t use this company again .
M	to be honest i am the kind of person_who always goes for the best deal and maxi raw don_'_t seem to be able to offer me that anymore .
M	ordered item early on thursday ( item was in stock ) but did not receive it until late the next wednesday , there was no way of tracking its progress
M	i had a three year contract with vodafone and not once did they treat me like a valued_customer until my contract was up , then they pestered me constantly with quite rubbish offers .
F	!
M	all seemed to be going well , however the passed and the globe didn_'_t arrive .
F	easy to watch prices and pick right time to buy .
M	however , as the items were not suitable i returned but have had no confirmation of receipt by ja despite chasing .
F	now anything i need for the water i '_ll be coming here first !
M	we never received any word of apology or recompense .
M	unfortunately when i decided a couple of weeks_later to order those items i found incomplete parts offered on line ( the train to go with a highlite backdrop , sold as a kit ), i ordered gels to go with the lights but you didn_'_t have the gel holder .
M	all the speakers i wanted were in stock in the finish i wanted .
F	ordering the item was simple enough but .
M	stay as far away as possible .
F	thank_you cheapsmells
M	light and good looking good service
F	and just to clarify , i check my junk email everyday as well - it hasn_'_t slipped into there either !
F	why advertise olay anti ageing cream wash and post out anti wrinkle face wash .
M	i did and the parcel had been smashed to pieces .
F	for the avoidance of doubt im posting my order ref here . you '_ve had it 0 times already .
M	some of the wheel_nuts were rusted .
F	consequently we weren_'_t sure if it would actually be delivered on that day .
F	the items were collected on the 00st_march and still havn_'_t had my cheque even_tho they did email me on the 00th_april saying it will be with me the next working day - that was a week_ago and no sign of it .
M	from the first enquiry to today , the day after delivery clms could not have been more helpful with follow ups from time to time as i waited for the car to be built .
M	an excellent service .
M	did not arrive first time i left it over week before making contact after 0 emalls the replacement arrived 0days after last email so 0_stars
M	love the product , sounds great !
F	i was very happy , with the service i received
F	i am very disappointed .
F	good value for money much_cheaper_than the vets .
M	with 0000 '_s of hours of tv shows and movies where else would you go for the low price .
M	i came_across the ao site via a search_engine .
M	this is absolutely typical of value basket , order and money were received and 0 days_later it was still being_processed , it had not even left their warehouse , almost three_weeks_later their update was it would be processed next week .
M	shall use again .
M	to put it quite_simply .
M	i '_m now fuming and in future will check when i buy from online company '_s which delivery company they use and if it '_s yodel i will not buy from them !!
M	well_done really good price , good delivery and pleasant telephone staff , what more can one ask for
F	very poor service a bad_experience which will not be repeated
M	i deliberately did not book the small car option .
M	the chair arrived the next_day and was easy to assemble , particularly with the help of a very useful video .
F	don_'_t you have bigger boxes !
F	i ordered and paid for four dog worming_tablets from vet -_medic .
M	prices paid are hardly_ever the same , the dfds system is often faulty , and offers continually change .
F	this is the second time i '_ve_used animed , and both_times had no_problems .
M	when i rang back an_hour later i was told i the order had already been dispatched so i had to pay another delivery fee !
F	a very efficient company and thanks to cristian who dealt_with my order , he couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
M	we were very pleased with the flowers and timing of the delivery also i liked the feedback you gave_me on my mobile yours richard bowman
M	afterall , there are plenty of others that will take my money
M	as of yet they have not credited her account back anything for lack of service and i am fuming .
F	i ordered the handles for her & they arrived speedily .
M	and they will ignore any claims you make if any of the items of the shipment was damaged , so if it something broke in your shipment , good luck hearing back from them .
M	and i was not disappointed , the worktops arrived right on time to be fitted by my carpenter .
M	and having paid the extra £_00 for installation and arranged with a colleague to receive delivery as i could be present all day myself the delivery person said they couldn_'_t remove old washer or install new one as the water wasn_'_t turned off .
F	from purchase to delivery the experience was good .
F	apologise if anyone has_been misled .
F	the bag is great
M	in those 0 days i twice emailed asking for an update and for the courier details so i could speak to the courier and tell them to cancel the delivery .
M	the people i have dealt_with have been friendly and very efficient .
M	having the fitter come out to my home was more convenient .
F	my appointment had already been booked , but there were others who were going for their first consultation who appeared to be treated with more priority .
M	really fast delivery and kept_uptodate regarding order .
F	i ordered flowers for a friends 00th_birthday .
M	scam !
M	the replacement heads for my electric_toothbrush were much to tight and were very difficult to remove after use , my wife was not strong_enough to do it herself .
M	to cap it all we had been double charged for something else and noticed that we couldn_'_t see where the credit was .
M	a different_story with rx_sport . a quick phone_call , lovely , informative and helpful woman on the end of the line made sure my prescription was re checked .
F	how_dare you delay your response to emails , and then expect a prompt reply to your ‘ offer of refund ’ within 00_hours .
M	that seems to me to be an unjustifiable case of over - charging , and has spoiled an otherwise - agreeable experience .
M	it usually costs me about an extra £_00 - 00 pounds to use another airline - well_worth it .
M	highly_reccomend them .
F	did this for ease of ordering and it became very stressful amd hard i think it needs to be said on the website to check spam and also to be made clear that whatever the order there is always a requirement to communicate with the doctor and make lots of statements re promising to contact own gp etc
F	i can '_t_believe_how they treat their customers .
M	this was the third order i ' d placed and it was the the third order that had arrived on time .
M	there for 0 . 00 , explained other problems , car was whisked_away and i had a coffee in the waiting area .
F	only 0_months later and my fence is literally useless .

F	i ordered it on sunday morning and it was delivered on wednesday .
F	the flimsy single row of sellotape had burst and the box arrived totally open .
F	mob : 00000000000
F	clothes to order was very slow in getting the second design back from the digitiser and the customer service rep was attempting to suggest it was me that caused the delay which was not the case .
M	the supplier offered a 0 night refund which was ok .
M	its as good as listening to the advice of friends and family .
M	i explained i was buying the laptop for my sister who_lives in belfast .
F	!
F	easy to navigate website .
F	the pods do work in my machine but i generally have to put them through twice to get a good cup .

M	anyway , back to homebase .
F	i put my order with you on the 0th_november and it is now the 00th_november and i still have not received them although payment was taken out of my account the day i ordered the cartridges on line
F	i said i would write a review about this and i was told " go on then " and was cut_off .
M	which are difficult to stop , given to third_parties whom start sending emails etc .
M	blatantly won_'_t arrive for 00th_birthday
M	used before and would use again .
F	this is the worst estate_agents on the planet .
F	!
M	site is a dream and all done in a few mins too !
F	they then said that the offer code was on spends of £_00 + but no one on the ' online ' voucher was this states i read these things carefully .
M	i e_- mailed ( wed_night ) them and got a response thursday_morning saying they would sent a complete new set for 0 asking when would be convient to have the delivery .
M	if not , we will let you know at some point after you have ordered it ".
F	however on asking for a refund so as to hire elsewhere they said it was rentalcars who had his money , not them . so he asked rentalcars for a refund and they refused . after a tense conversation with a manager there my friend managed to get £_00 . 00 back . money for old rope and a nasty rip_off , so beware good rental prices but , with a nasty sting in the tail !!
F	i found the swatch_strap i was looking for - completed the order without_any problem and couldn_'_t_believe it when the next_day it dropped through the letter_box in perfect_condition !
M	wondered what to do with all those unused xmas cards with lost envelopes - managed to find matching sizes and save half the cost of new cards !
M	all went fine until i tried to use paypal from here in australia and your connection was rejected .
F	the price was phenomenal given it was near mint_condition . much_better value than ebay or other stores .
F	goods were thrown over the back gate as it was locked .
M	we did find to fold the cards because of the thickness they were difficult to flatten to put in envelopes but his is only a minor_point .
M	on friday i had no phone_call , however i did receive a letter from a debt collecting agency saying that my account had been passed_onto them and that talktalk want their money .
F	having built the frame and put in rails etc we needed modern doors to add the finishing_touch .

F	i did book in a hurry because my husband was ill and i was not sure_whether i was going to be able to go .
F	i have been calling and emailing escapade and no one is getting back to me .
F	not to mention the products that were not in stock that were replaced with something_else now i understand that they do run_out of stock , but replacing burger buns with hot dog rolls , now i cant see the logic .
M	the only positive thing is that i '_m clearly not the only one who has felt the need to vent some truly disgraceful issues .
F	this company has_been a total_nightmare , no direct_debit was ever set_up , i have had to contact them every_month with at_least a 00 minute hold time .
M	tracking facilities are standard and good .
M	bought pink tickets at the o0_arena , london for the 00 / 00 /_0000 for my wife last christmas .
M	the product arrived as advised .
M	without a doubt i would give 0_stars for sorting_out the faulty product that i was sold .
F	fast delivery service but when i received the game it did not come with any cellophane_wrapping or promotional leaflets usually put in ps0_games , prompting me to think these games may infact be second_hand .
M	no_problems - though to be fair , all i have done is pay for , and receive documents . so 0_stars for contact so_far .
F	i phoned customer_services who told me that ' the driver wasn_'_t going to come '.
F	delivery arrived when they said it would .
M	well priced with fast delivery .
F	beautiful looking games and really good quality at a great price , just not sure of the playability and how much play time they will actually get .
F	this was , in fact , delivery of my new passport which i was waiting for , although it was hardly helpful that i had no warning of the delivery .
M	i was hoping , as a first purchase , to be pleased but the loo roll holder was a little disappointing .
M	always used vodafone on my mobiles throughout the years , they are pretty reliable , never had a problem with them , the signal is sloppy in certain_areas but i imagine thats the case with most of the network_providers .
F	please take my email adddress off my feedback and delete my username as my e_- mail address
M	the power_consumption of my kitchen lighting is now about 00 watts instead of 000_watts .
M	the replacement screen was booked to be fitted at feltham as i was told by the technician who visited my home that it was a complex job ( my car is a convertible ) and it was " better " to have it done at their centre .
F	will be ordering from them in future .
M	one thing that is crap is that i cant save the " ship to " addresses in the address book .
F	offer cheap clothes ( quality doesn_'_t matter when they are so cheap ).
M	the car_hire company was eurocar .
F	there was no offer of a substitution , i did not say no or send the alternative back , they didn_'_t send anything and yet i was charged and i am still chasing the refund as the driver has not ' notified ' them as yet !!!
F	it arrived at 0pm .

F	a long time to take my things
M	when they arrived they looked excellent
F	very pleased with my product adobe mixer_taps , but delivery took about a week which was longer_than_anticipated .
M	instead they offered a replacement battery at reduced cost which i reluctantly paid for but it never arrived .
M	a fantastic service .
F	i was updated by email and very happy with the service provided .
M	yodel directs tracking_number starts with yol
M	so if wanted a replacement or refund it cost me money due to the companies mishandling !
M	had great difficulties getting the network setup right .
M	there were 0 staff stood around the checkouts doing bugger all .
M	( i think they got the price wrong . but let '_s keep that between ourselves )

F	to my surprise it turned_up the next_day ( if i ’ d have had another so called missed parcel i would have blown a fuse as they try to deliver your item twice then you have to go and pick it up from the “ local ” depot which just so happens to be a fifty minute journey there and another fifty back ( and that ’_s if you have a car !)
F	but no fault to urban_industries just the delivery company .

F	found muck_boots on internet and rang to order them .
F	thankyou serenataflowers . com - would definitely use this service again !

F	great website .
F	ordered flowers for my mother '_s 00th_birthday , ordered at_least 0_days in_advance with a delivery slot for before 00 ( noon ).
F	shoes website - they have a super range
F	couldn_'_t ask for better service .
M	i would
M	i use kay and co who use yodel for there deliverys . my problems started 0_weeks_ago
F	,
M	the website is very well thought out with lots of different search options .
F	we were unable to contact anyone to check what had happened as the phone number they gave only operated during office hours .
M	parcel 0 i got it 0 days late from when it went out for delivery !!
M	if booking fitting at national_tyres who seem to have the tryre shopper contract for fitting go during the week when they have all their staff in niot on a weekend when they get a lot of business and have skeliton crews working .
M	during this period , they kept me up to date with the status of the order .
F	! they were having a laugh and this has made me much wary of buying kgb & groupon deals
M	i didn_'_t get what i paid for in terms of delivery .
M	eventually they sent the wrong taps which were way too big for the small sink .
M	easy to use , flowers did not look as good as picture ,, delivery expensive
M	one of my friend decided a few_days before that he would join us .
F	i '_ve had my glasses now for a couple weeks and they ' re perfect .
F	never contacted .

M	highly_recomend airport_parking at edinburgh no_hassle
M	no thanks
F	what i wasnt please with was the delivery !
M	i received a series of bids as well as helpful advice and recommendations that enabled_me to build trust with potential_suppliers and award the business to whom i ocnsidered to the best the service provider .
M	whilst overal we were extremely satisfied with the rental i was dissapointed with the cost of ' a full_tank of fuel ' which worked out at € 0 . 00 per_litre , as_opposed to a forecourt price around € 0 . 00 !
F	i was a little_apprehensive at ordering flowers from a site i had never used before .
F	sue and harriet ( the sweet itch pony )
F	quick delivery , good value
M	delivered within that timescale .
F	i was impressed with polybags service especially when they send you samples to try out .
F	i especially think it '_s great how you can select your local area / s and get deals that are located nearby .
F	!
M	for the last couple of years though i '_ve seen a trend for their prices being the same as the high_street , but you still have to wait 0 days for the items instead of grabbing them there and then .
M	had i paid the full price of £_00 i would have been extremely disappointed .
F	!
F	what sort of customer service is that ?
M	i recently had enough of intermittent internet and decided to move isp .
F	you get your item quickly .
M	things_happen , but this is a good company i feel and they gave_me a good price .
F	not only did i consider that ctc their prices good value for money but their delivery costs were over 00_% lower_than another company i had been looking at .
M	good place to buy if you use standard prescription_lenses , but getting varifocals right first time seems to be a problem . they are prepared to keep adjusting the lenses if you ask them to , but who_wants to keep bouncing glasses backwards and forwards until they get them right ???
F	the hotels were great but said we had to go through_expedia to change the hotel .
F	the prices are not worth the hassle and end up costing you more if something_goes_wrong .
F	great service but we did not appreciate that the size of the embroidered_logo would be the same regardless of the size of the sweatshirts so on some of them the logo looks enormous and out of proportion .
M	on repeated occasions i have not been able to get through at all to customer service for over a week and we have received repeated lies and excuses from staff .
M	have used sublime before and will_continue to use .
F	and it arrived ( with free_p_&_p ) in just 0_days in plenty of time for her first lesson .
F	to cut a long_story_short , do not use this website !
F	i believed i could buy a return ticket ( london - lisbon ) in one single process but was frustrated by being told that some aspect of my journey could not be booked but with no information as to which / what .
M	when picking_up our amigo car who we paid 000_euros to , we were asked by gold car for another 00_euros which we thought we had already paid in our total invoice from amigo rental . we feel we were conned not a good start to our family holiday wont use again
M	expensive .
F	it has taken 0_months to get only a third of the cashback owed , they then told me i had to wait a further 0_months for them to investigate .
F	the quality of the products is excellent but very sad that it took five days and a phone_call before i received my order .
M	all in all , a fantastic service .
F	not only is the automated process of taking only the postcode from an address and giving that to a local_florist fundamentally flawed but the customer service was extremely poor showing no sign of understanding , empathy or service ( aside from getting more money from me to pay for a service they hadn_'_t delivered ).
M	good prices , very fast delivery and a good product
F	my order came early and looks_fab , really effective .
F	i ordered two puzzles as christmas_presents as there was currently a discount .
M	looked ok when received but on further inspection one of the boxes had been dropped on it '_s edge .
F	excellent price and whole_thing made even easier by the fact that i could collect in store .
F	better living were very prompt in coming out after my initial_contact and the furniture didn_'_t take long to be made .
F	this was done through a third_party used by made and involved a lot of unreturned calls on my behalf .
M	i have family in italy and it is cheaper for me to travel indirect ( via london )
F	however , it was really awkward to put_together and the instructions were poor .
F	wow that great i had used animed for the previous treatments and will certainly use them again in 0_months time i have also recommended animed to everyone i know that have pets .
F	we ordered from bride and groom_direct after a lot of searching for the right wedding_invitations .
F	very easy and fast transaction .
F	alas , they sent the wrong items , sending bog_standard round ones that i could have got anywhere .
F	i love the tv_cabinet that i purchased from oakfurniture_land , it looks so classy in my sitting_room , one fault though , i found a mark near the bottom which feels_like glue , i have rang up and promised an expert to come and look at it but up to now no one has came , but sure they will ring soon .
M	when i asked for explanation they couldn_'_t give one
F	it was broken and i was unhappy with it .
F	cannot buy this product in shops now .
F	i then tried again and it all went through ok .
F	excellent price for product , and brilliant delivery time , ordered and delivered within two_days .
F	0 pages were blank .
M	never mind , i can now charge the battery in my cleaner .
F	all orders were delivered timely and were exactly_what was ordered no exceptions .
F	little did i know .
F	i then asked wally if he would show me with the allen_key how to adjust the shelves and rails as he had only pointed to the fixings and i wanted to be sure exactly how they worked .
F	i am very happy with the colour .
M	domestic parcels arrive within 00_hours normally and even a parcel to austrlia took less_than a working week !
F	for the price i would expect guaranteed next_day delivery not 0 - 0_days
M	they don_'_t always describe things as they actually are .
F	000000
M	is it doing what it '_s supposed to ??
F	they say on their site that they have a 000_% guarantee but i '_m currently at 0 %!
M	fast and efficient service , good range of products at a very good price .
F	this is the first time iv used this site but il now be a regular customer .
F	we went_onto their website and all seemed very straight_forward .
F	blinds are lovely and operate really well .
M	i rang up again an_hour later and spoke to a different member of staff .
F	i have ordered from here a few_times_now and each time the service has_been absolutely_faultless .
M	?
M	avoid !
M	mr_memory will restore your faith in good old_fashioned excellent service
F	we bought full_stave oak_worktops and upstands and were very very happy with the quality .
M	!
M	pity the admin isn_'_t as good as the product !!
F	then we hopped off to have something to eat at henry '_s bar near green park .
M	wifi didn_'_t really work .
M	item bought very quick delivery , thank_you !!
M	purchased new wheels (£_000 ) from wiggle unfortunately though incorrect item ordered - accept this was my fault .
M	will comment further on delivery .
F	i ended_up buying from john_lewis who were exceptional and i would never hesitate to use them in the future
F	as it was a sad_occasion its taken me some time to do this feedback .
M	you will never get a reliable service from this company
M	their website is very robust and easy to navigate .
F	in summary don_'_t do it !
F	we had to pay extra money to the driver because we werent at home when he delivered , but he hadnt told us when he was planning to deliver the goods in first place .
F	really straight_forward and cheque sent immediately , would recommend .
F	now , the car is here , i am very very happy , the vehicle is lovely and spotless throughout .
F	delivery was quick as well , so i guess i would rate procook at nine and half out of ten
M	we have a date for this for 00 may , 0 months after the first installation .
M	we was due to sail home from denmark on saturday the 00th of june .
M	highly_recommend this site !
F	he phoned in the afternoon .
F	she said they were lovely , but they arrived in 0 bunches and greenery to be arranged by her .
M	the other thing which i have noticed especially in south_america is that when you book via hostelworld you end up in the rooms that are a lot of the time the rooms that are not so good .
F	the tiles were very well_packaged and clearly_marked ' fragile ', yet i received one box where half the tiles were ' snapped ' along one edge .
M	luckily i do have a fb account or i '; d have been stuck .
F	after many emails and calls to <_external link_removed >,.
F	i would definately not_hesitate to order from this company again .
M	the phone had a slight_crack on the back so that had to be repaired before any warranty issues could be sorted_out , they didn_'_t email me saying that the back needed to be repaired i had to phone up chasing them .
F	it '_s now march of the year after and this is still not sorted grrrrr !
M	you might say wgaf but actually , it '_s an important_factor when casting agents , well , cast so it becomes an accepted grey_area and actors may find it useful to misrepresent themselves occassionally .
M	so if i hear nothing further and dont receive product or refund then small_claims court and off to maplins .
F	the goods arrived within_00hours of placing the order and was packed well .
M	the guitar arrived in its case with no protection / packaging whatsoever , it just had a cable tie around it , to stop the case from opening .
M	unfortunately despite saying they had been dispatched , nothing arrived .
M	literally the worst customer_care skills in the history of the world .
M	checkout_process also really easy .
M	instead i got stonewalling and blaming of the italian florist .
F	the bunch of flowers from yourselves was the same size but cost me £_00 and this was free delivery .
F	thank_you !
F	however , i was disappointed that five or six of the invitations were basically spoiled and unuseable .
M	i would be very interested to know what the owner of the company thinks about his rude staff that hang up on you and treat you like crap .
M	unbelievably , the satnav was 00euros a day and the booster_seat 0euros a day .
M	problem resolved with no_hassle but clearly should not have happened in the first place .
F	however , had i not had a case , the credit_card companies would not have refunded me in full .
F	!
M	dyson actually searched around the internet for a part for me , called me to say there was a part in stock at espares . co . uk , so i went to the website , checked that it was definitely in stock and placed the order with an expected delivery date of 0 to 0 days .
F	the continental_breakfast , served a few hours prior to landing back in th uk , consisted of just a small blueberry muffin & an orange_juice .
M	).
F	having sent my exemption cert twice still struggled to get order delivered
F	i had to enter all of my details 0 times !
M	how do i return item for refund as not understanding return form , do i have to give bank details , do i have to pay for postage ,
M	do you know of any other company that charges a 000_% cancellation_fee ?
M	caroline immediately offered to cancel it and refund my money and very kindly gave_me some other_places that i could_possibly get insurance for someone out of the country .
M	i like the prices , i like customer service , i particularly like that i am able to talk to real_person with expert_knowledge rather_than having to leave messages on my computer .
M	i have few reservations_about the final product here .
F	fair_enough but subsequent tracking came up with ' not collected ' and then somewhat odd a missing document .
M	the site was very straight_forward , i ordered the gear i needed on line , made a quick phone_call ( to a helpful member of there customer service team ) to clarify the delivery times .
F	what else could go_wrong i asked myself , i '_m still_waiting for my credit for the rest of the order , when i asked about this , their main_concern was to pick_up the 0 unwanted , poor substituted wine they were trying to off load onto me . when i said i would be in friday_morning but only up to 00am , they gave_me the great line but that isn_'_t very convenient for them !!!!!!!
M	the amount of powder was a lot .
M	no urgency though as most of the services are next_day and you really need to book before 00am to guarantee same day pick_up .
F	i would definately recommend it .
F	would definately order from this site again , i found some great products that i use reguallary at great prices , beats everywhere_else i look online and in - store .
F	however on the way home our car was ready and waiting which was nice as we landed at 0am .
M	i was overall pretty happy with my order although a little annoyed that the price of the item i ordered dropped by £_00 a couple of days_later .
F	very reasonably_priced delivered quickly sometimes no postage prices
F	heartbroken boy on christmas day !
M	logically he supposed to take off the full price of mot to have a discount when i booked it online !
M	would have been helpful to know this was required whilst ordering .
M	i took the refund and won_'_t be back .
M	they don_'_t answer their emails within what i would call a reasonable time ( 0 working_days on many occasions ) so i have had no option but to cancel my direct_debit to stop the cu # ts taking money from me which is not theirs to take .
M	we tried to buy from another supplier but the fact was we liked the product , i decided to bite the bullet and try on buy online only to find the items could be delivered within 0 days which they where .
F	on the chosen day at around_midday received a voicemail ( recorded ) saying delivery would not be taking place that day , but the next .
M	sevice excellent
M	ordered new breeks monday_night , here two_days_later but too big , re - ordered wednesday_night , breeks arrived friday just in time for a trip to the grouse moor at the weekend .
F	products great however recent paying extra for delivery of items over_£ 0 regardless of weight and sent in enormous_box which is waste of packaging .
M	very good prices and easy to order tyres , but you must ring the tyre_fitting_bay because what you put on the order for time and day of fitting has no relevance with the fitting_bay as i found out when i went to have my tyres_fitted , and was told i would have to wait at_least one and a half to two hours !!
M	i called again and again and occassionally when he answered and i asked what was going on he hung_up on me , alltogether he hung_up on me 0 times .
M	i received and email_saying my strings had been dispatched , then another email was sent saying that my strings weren_'_t in stock and there would be a delay .
M	the council won_'_t come out and check there dish and there telling_me to pay for a 0rd_party engineer to come and sort this out , it '_s an_absolute_joke , the customer service is diabolical , no one wants to help you , they talk over you and just keep saying the same thing as in there reading off a script , that '_s the overseas contact centre and the uk_based ones ,
F	upon_opening the box i thought that someone had replaced the bouquet from the local_garage .
M	products in stock and shipped immediately .
F	.
M	the part arrived on time in great condition and my car passed it '_s mot !.
M	now if that is what the company does for me what could it do for you .
F	this is by far the simplest to navigate ecig business i have come_across .
M	it '_s a straight_forward choosing and order process , a few checks and the glassess are on their way - as simple as that !
F	meal suggestions were shown on the front of the packets but i was given no idea of what to add or how much .
M	i would recommend this company .
F	any way the engineer came in the 00st , pressed the reset button and it started up .
M	reply from customer service " it is in my policy small_print , you should have read it "
M	great product ( dog bowl to slow down fast eater ), good price , great service , quick delivery .
F	placed order on 00thmarch 0000 .
F	overall the service was ok i did contact customer_services on several_occasions as my cashback was very late .
M	the exact_same clarinet was offered through the school programme and the price was set @ £_000 - 00 inc_vat .
F	we purchased the veloped recently for my husband who_suffers from progressive neuropathy meaning that he cannot walk unaided as he has no balance .
M	the most expensive company for tv and broadband and phone .
M	you should try them and enjoy a pleasureable_experience .
M	goods are great but communication poor
F	we ordered ind pallet cvr hous000 and it said 0 / pk at price £ 0 . 00 so we assumed price per pack .
M	beware !!!!!!!
M	there is another company where i buy my supplements where they charge you $ 0 dollars flat_rate shipping no matter_how many products you purchase .
F	use royal_mail .
F	stark contrast - hence returned to 0nd shop since for further items .
F	i have yet to be able to contact serenata to resolve this issue .
F	when arriving at the hotel i was told that i had to pay £_000 to make up the full bill so £_000_+ £_000 = £_000 an extra £_00 more then when i actually booked the hotel on the website !
M	i knew the product i wanted to complete the job , went on the internet found tile_fix direct had the wall boards i required at the right price with delivery the next_day , fantastic will use them again .
F	i rang to chase_up this afternoon to be told it had been sold in the shop and the shop was closing_down .
F	but that '_s what i '_ve had to do .
F	i really like the texts of when to expect delivery .
F	the company made good the deficiency in the order , but again , waited 0_days for receipt .
F	item was well_packaged and good quality for what we paid , my son was very happy with it .
F	reaserched pet insurance and the gold cover offered by healthy_pets seems by far the superior for the money .
F	thanks for an excellent quick and reliable service
M	everyone note how value basket do not give out deadlines they continually say things like " i am confident it will be refunded very shortly " what exactly does this mean , very shortly ?
M	this has tarnished my previous good experiences with event and i don_'_t think i '_ll be a repeat_customer due to this .
F	came damaged left on the doorstep with no card !!
M	his phone also experiences regular loss of signal .
M	yodel : hi david .
M	email communication was excellent and delivery was quicker_than_anticipated .
F	they are a terrible site and i will never use them again .
M	the tyre and wheel arrived in reasonable time ( from germany ) and the shipping charge was half the amount an english company once charged me for a royal_mail delivered small jiffy_bag .
F	i would not use this service again .
F	and guess_what it had not been collected .
F	if you buy through store you cannot have a refund only an exchange .
M	great web_site , we '_ll worth a look x
F	after receiving my instructions and packaging details i sent off my phone , i decided to go for the recorded delivery option at £ 0 . 00 .
F	emma travers
M	because of this , next time i '_ll just choose a plce locally i can drive to
M	perhaps an unpacking service at the point of delivery would be useful ?
M	the top can twist in the soft packaging .
M	their call system put me in a queue for 0mins and then dumped my call into a " leave a message " voice_mail with a uninterested grumpy male voice .
M	your customer service did not answer completely or accurately to my questions .
F	i bought this as a surprise for my son and have to admit that although some of the pictures were very good in colouring , others were not .
M	thank_you to all concerned at brook_taverner and please keep_up the good ( no great ) work .
F	we had disposed of our old desk because delivery had been confirmed .
M	for no_hassle good value for money
F	i was wary at first but i sent it off and hey_presto all the meds came to my house within days , half the price even after being charged for the vet signing a prescription !!
M	i am highly unlikely to use the service again .
F	pah next time !
F	asda do great prices , no denying that , and the people instore are usually very friendly .
M	ilkin .
F	ordering my child '_s fancy_dress costume was very straight_forward and delivery was really quick .
F	i brought two angry bird plush toys as a gift for my brother almost 0_months_ago and they have not arrived .
M	i was texted , and went to collect . but only 0 towels were in the package , with a note saying 0 were packed and 0 to follow .
F	fees per_month range from 0 usd to 0 usd for each metal
F	pub within the day good times .
M	great service and good delivery and great stuff
M	i would say that this service is not acceptable
M	i am giving three stars because my previous_experiences have been positive and it could be that the basket had been badly transported ( and knowing yodel i would not be at all surprised ).
F	firstly the " returns service " via named shops - none of the shops the parcel was taken to knew anything about the returns services !
F	finally paid in may .
M	would look at them again should i need any formal_wear .
F	i had sent an image which was not good enough quality to proceed with my order ; an_email was sent to in form me as such and requested that i contact them , but this email went into my junk_mail and i did not see it .
F	after some mumbling i got " oh_yes it was the 00th_dec " after all .
F	we had an ' out of the box ' query that was dealt_with by a friendly and efficient person on the phone .
F	i ordered neutral energy_saving bulbs no .
M	given that the issues quoted their expertise in their furniture should have made them realise that a french_polisher would be required , so why was one not booked to come with the senior technician ?
F	however , there were no essays nor final exam .
M	delivery was prompt and in the evening when i was in which was perhaps a bit of luck .
M	i will have no hesatation recemending hifiheadphones to my friends and collegues .
M	this is the first time i have ever received an oral product with no dosage instructions , which i would have thought could be quite dangerous , depending on what was in the contents .
M	the clay shooting was good especially .
F	i guess the larger_size though would be too long on the straps .
M	e buyer refused - just wanted me to end up with 0 x_0gb_ram which i dont want or need .
F	i submitted 00 books to this company , some of them brand_new and only one was taken on as ' acceptable ', for which i received the grand_total of 00p - for 00 books !
M	very good experience .
F	who is better off !!?
M	outstanding !
M	what more could you ask for ?
M	if you don_'_t mind waiting a long time to receive your order then weldricks is a good bet , as they are very cheap .
F	?
M	i am a lorry_driver for dhl and take this kind of unprofessionalism personally , this is by far the worst company that i have ever_dealt_with but you live and learn ,
M	absolute perfect fit .

M	by enlarge we were happy with the quality of the meat , mainly steak .
F	the delivery was difficult to organise as they don_'_t deliver on weekends or during evenings and times / dates were made by an external delivery company when we weren_'_t in - the website said they did weekend deliveries but it turned_out they don_'_t - that was the reason we bought it then .
M	the only_downside was that at the top of the advert it stated that all deliveries were free , but i then found that my items attracted a delivery charge that was nearly as much as the items themselves . buyer be aware of this

M	thanks for the trophies - top quality products at great prices .
F	having looked into the company further i think the people i spoke to work for another company , and that infurn are a very dodgy set_up .
M	last winter called them out because our boiler packed up ( i '_m not a gas safe plumber ), the engineer stared at the boiler for 00_minutes then told me he didn_'_t know what the problem was , and that i should call out the manufacturer .
M	would definitely recommend animed and use them again .

F	this company is absolutely fantastic .
F	seriously - ask around for recommendations , phone any other data_recovery and ask their opinion on fields / rapid data_recovery , search the net , be prepared to spend more money - avoid_avoid_avoid !
F	the only_thing is the hat has a brown stain on it which makes the item look used but due to my ordering it and needing it immediately i don_'_t have time to return it before wearing it .
F	having sent many many packages and flowers in the past to this address with no problem or lack of delivery before i called the email sender to enquire how this had happened .

M	i would have hoped that nitrotek would have everything in stock , as there '_s not many other_sites that sell spare acme - tech rc parts , and are well - known .
M	quality and customer service are consistent and we will definitaly purchase again !
M	my only option . wait another 0_weeks for them to re - order / deliver / install the correct cooker , take another day off work and re - arrange the builders i had booked to come in and finish off our kitchen the same week .
F	these conversations took place on the phone as all the email responses we got were automated and didn_'_t answer our questions .
F	i '_ve never had any_problems re delivery , payment or products !
F	i called to sort this out , ( this was the fifth phone_call by now ).
M	however , the real_test will come if i ever have to claim and then we '_ll see how good they are .
M	will shop there again
F	i am a housetrip convert .
M	all the disputes iv head with them as a buyer and seller have been handled very well , and they can not be held_responsible for the conduct of all there users , though it would be nice if sellers could go back to leaving negative_feedback where necessary .
F	this was a good delivery as the driver followed my exact instructions as to where to leave the parcel .
M	the operator from hell flicked a backhand across the loose change and uttering something to the effect " at_least make_sure you are using the right money " there was no one else in the queue to delay so we couldn_'_t be accuse of slowing the money taking operation !
F	bought two large blinds for front rooms .
F	i emailed the care address as instructed for missing items and received a reply asking for photos of the package , which i duly did on 00th_march , although this wouldn_'_t show anything unexpected .
M	i would respect & trust evans much more if they took care of issues like this properly .
F	this order was delivered and signed for but not to me - i contacted hotline once again to inform them i had not received the order they thought this was very strange and i agreed - i was concerned_about the company ' well you never know these days who you are dealing_with ' anyway , i received a call from hotline who told me they had found my orders they had been delivered to the local hospital because the address was the shropshire and mid - wales pituitary group the delivery company presumed it was for the local hospital - well at_least the order ( s ) had been found and i received my order plus one extra , but all credit to hotline they traced my goods , they certainly went that extra_mile , giving that all important 000_% customer service .
F	!
F	the mount for the bike computer box was also bashed and did not look the nice christmas gift i intended .
F	after a couple of emails i decided to unsubsribe as i no_longer needed their services , but the emails kept coming .
F	they use yodel and yodel hands it over to a courier to bring it to me , why they do this ?
M	hopefully me posting this will get me a response , as its a joke .
M	after several emails back and forward i am still none the wiser , they say that the delivery company will contact me but still nothing , i have asked them to confirm what details they have given the delivery company to make_sure they have the correct phone number but still nothing .
M	they have no proof of postage or tracking , how do you know if they will post it !!
M	then the cd players disappeared out of my basket , and into another persons !
F	they always have great offers and booking is painless .
F	i returned the item within 00_hours of receiving it on the 00th_may .

F	excellent service and recipient thrilled with the flowers and scent given out from the roses and stocks .
F	brilliant service , letting_me know where my order was and how long it would take .
F	this unsafe delivery method would put me off ordering again
M	so simple yet so difficult for many online_retailers .
M	they are cheap but what what cost ?
F	so i bought the fabric - they sell on at a profit .
M	!
M	in fact , i have seen bouquets with fewer shrivelled buds and blooms at the local costcutters for £ 0 .
M	if i could i would give this site a minus star_rating .
F	excellent service , speedy delivery .
F	on 0nd_april_0000 i was informed that the watch would be with me beginning / middle of next week , this would mean at_least ten days delevery .
M	every order has arrived spot on , promptly ( and including the occasional freebie ).
F	i would have thought with the issues surrounding the chairs someone would have put it together to check it was not faulty before arranging couriers to drop_off and collect the amount of times they did .
F	having said that , i was kept up to date on the progress of the order by email so otherwise the service was good .
M	thanks very much .
F	order came on time and our experience with flashbay was great .
M	there are a couple of thing that really need to be improved : one of the things is that on the website you will see the starting price for dorm and private , but this can be a private room for 0 persons ?
F	this is the cheapest around and as soon as i had ordered it , i got an_email_confirming the order , with a reference_number in case of any query .
F	i feel annoyed at myself as i didnt think to look at the websites reviews before buying .
M	so i suspect their after - sales arent very good .
M	ordered around 0pm and it arrived about 0am the next_morning - although of course we were just lucky to be at the front of the courier '_s delivery list that day . nevertheless , a great service .
F	that '_s what i call pretty amazing service and delivery , i am also very pleased with the quality of the rug , i highly_recomend this company if you are looking for a rug .
F	00 of us placed orders in excess of £_000 and paid in cash on one order .
F	very pleased
F	when i had a concern the staff and consultants responded very quickly and helpfully whilst treating me with dignity and respect .
F	i was informed that this was ok , but when they eventually decided to send the tops they ' forgot ' to change the address so i had to inform the shipping company myself , which was a massive hassle for everyone_involved .
F	this was my first and last ever time of using these_cowboys .
F	i ordered my coat just before xmas and i got it in time !
M	i would like to give 0_stars but can only give 0 .
F	i wanted to buy from a local supplier but will definitely not recommend them to anybody .
F	at this point i was very annoyed and sent an_email to customer_services , as soon as staff were back at work on monday_morning re - delivery was arranged and am pleased to say yodel have just delivered my parcel !!
M	the prices were extremely good and the items arrived as if by magic the very next_day !
M	i will still use them though , so i guess that is all that matters .
M	they delivered next_day and were first_class .
M	i do highly_recommend this service it '_s awesome , the only_gripe is i was quoted 00_hours for unlock and after 00_hours i was worried i ' d been conned lol .
F	previou s experiences very positive , but not this time .
M	switching from ' spare_parts ' to ' upgrades ' for a specific_model of rc buggy .
M	it '_s also eye opening that trustpilot is also bottom in the marks of their own rating comparison !
M	excellent service , phones posted one day , received by fonebank the following_day , email confirmation sent to say cheque in the post and the cheque received the next_day .
M	0 .
M	overall good , but not the best experience in the world .
M	wifi was very important in our decision on where to stay and it was non_existent / useless .
F	i telephoned them again , got the same man and asked again if he had the item in stock , at which he promptly put down the phone on me !!
F	from greece , the questions were cheaper to ask via_email than telephone .
M	slightly_disappointed in the actual size of bouquet as it seemed much fuller on advert photo .
M	i received the products a full week_later .
M	unfortunately i did not see anything i liked for 0 months and they took this credit from me .
F	showing product as stock when it was nearly two_weeks before delivery was made .
M	just be prepared to take your time and to say no to ' the salesmen ' at the desks .
F	fuming !
F	so fast posted tue cash in bank by thurs
M	i rang just to check a few details and within a couple of minutes , the friendly and very knowledgeable man had answered my questions and i ' d ordered the part .
M	great product .
M	the swing frame arrived in a timely_manner , without the quadpod .
M	this is the third time i have bought from function00 and always been very happy with the service and products .
F	i needed a new door_handle and couldn_'_t get what i needed in town . in fact i didn_'_t really know what i needed and yet with one quick phone_call and a few questions that weren_'_t even beyond me to answer i had the perfect door_handle with all the fittings of excellent quality in just three_days ( and that was over a weekend !)
M	but when it arrived it was a 00ml_bottle of blue statos cost £ 0 . 00
F	!
M	apart_from the initial disappointment of them being out of stock of the model i wanted , i am very pleased with the service .
F	on balance i would probably consider_buying from them again .
F	it was frustrating as i wasn_'_t going to pay p_&_p for one item and then find the others in stock later on .
F	very easy transaction and pleased with product and delivery
M	as a side , i am an investment analyst and noticing the state of the new cross office , the poor condition of the phones , no letters on the keyboard , the old monitors and the general disrepair of the depot , this branch is being run into the ground .
M	pleasant enough but nothing special to make me want to spend an extra pound or two over supermarket own brands .
F	(?!
F	i called them and mentioned this and the guy on the phone said ' oh it '_s sitting here next to me , shall i send it out ?"
F	so what i got was an inferior ( the company sloane square is located in lancashire and is a brand of the colonial gift company which is used by prestige ) and smaller box of chocolates now in pieces .
F	i love my kitchenaid_mixer , and the free knives are a lovely bonus !
M	customer_services are so so and on some occasions are pretty crap .
F	the car engine was very warm , the fuel monitor had reduced by around 00 - 00 miles and the radio station had been charged .
M	competitive_pricing drew us to wicken for a great plum product . wicken_toys rang the day before to advise us of the delivery as promised . the product is of a superior design and took my son and i 0 hours to put it up . my grandaughter aged 0 has had thetime of her young life playing on her swing / slide . the free baby_seat that came with the set is a great addition .
F	we enjoy making our own_home_brew the good life is the only place you can get everything you need under one roof from hiring equipment for home_brew to everything needed for making preserves
M	), online booking easy .
M	pingligt !!!
F	i called again when i had my bags .
F	i never got a phone_call on the day and the unhelpful driver didn_'_t seem to know anything about it ( even_though it also mentioned it on my delivery note ).
M	<<<<<<<<<<<<<< update >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
M	what with the added expense of flights , hotels etc the whole trip was a total_failure .
F	your very fast and speedy sending bag out , only took 0days to post cheque for me , i will recommend friends to you when they want to sell phones .
M	?
M	it was very easy to identify the memory i needed and then to order .
F	my final comment , read all you can and make an educated decision before going ahead with this treatment .
F	on the plus_side i just transferred my money over to amazon and earned £_00 as a gift voucher :)
M	still nothing after two_days .
F	i received an_email at 00 : 00 to say the cleaner had cancelled !
M	i can '_t recommend this company enough , great service !
F	i get a call from hayley five mins later , she took down my card_details incorrectly and refund never been done even thoughh girl 0 mins earlier said it had already gone though , eventually after 00 days , i get my refund of £_000 back after 0 phone_calls , shocking customer service from girls who couldn_'_t care less about helping_me , one kept putting me on hold so she didn_'_t have to listen to me !!
F	anyway , so i didn_'_t get it delivered until after the weekend , by which i had to go out and buy some more egg_whites at waitrose , and borrow some of someone_else and my own_expense .
M	after using over the years a number of suppliers
F	total_nightmare .
M	ordered some things from amazon and thought i ' d check on the delivery tracking .
M	the speed of return was excellent , but i shall be very wary of including b_&_w images in any future orders .
F	incorrect items were received .
M	received a faulty product .
F	the product first bought in florence couldn_'_t find it anywhere but harrods in the uk , at double the price i paid .
M	suffice to say , it '_s 0_weeks_later and no sign of the card .
F	i don_'_t usually like ordering from websites but i found this so easy .
M	does what it says on the tin
M	highly_reccomend .
F	i rung them to get some help but the operator could not even find the hotel on my screen for the price that was showing on the dates .
M	and you will call these numbers because it '_s raining you don_'_t have a landline and its just a short call to edf energy anyway . bullshit .
F	i spent quite some time putting it together only to realise when i tried to fit the slats the wrong_size bed had been sent , i therefore spent my first night sleeping on a wooden_floor , which as you can_imagine is very uncomfortable .
F	the day of delivery i received an_email from them stating they could not find anyone to fulfil the order therefore it was cancelled .
F	the command of the english_language from their operators or managers is not great .
M	have tried every manner of communication to get in touch with staff but all calls are automated and after have spent a full day waiting for web help to just be told every twenty_minutes that my session had ended as all advisors were busy !!!!
M	it is a lot of effort to do things which can more easily be done by phone , email or forum .
M	mazuma was fast in payment and reliable as they kept to their words of the agreed sum .
M	i got my coins my buy now was set at the amount i bought which was 000 , 000 coins it got bought and i only got exactly 000 , 000 coins
M	had to take my 0 piece suit to a local seamstress .
F	they sell a fantastic range of products which are difficult to find on the high_street .
F	their website is great , they offer a wide_range of equestrian products at reasonable affordable_prices .
F	competitive_prices , friendly and efficient service , with well - packaged goods arriving on schedule .
M	ok site could be a little better layout
M	very satisfied customer
F	i wasn_'_t clear that my order had gone_through and as no money taken from account i had to call them .
F	then the fun and games begin !
M	we decieded to go_ahead and it has_proved to be easy and seamless .
M	i have doubts_about the actual size of the bunches (+ luxury options ) i bought .
F	very reliable .
F	we are absolutely_delighted with the service provided by mail order trees .
F	i cannot_speak highly_enough of replacement_keys serviice .
M	i believe that the aftersales manager was making a false assertion .
M	however , once i did get hold of a person ( via the company twitter ) they were very helpful and gave_me a full_refund .
F	i emailed , but after a couple of hours with no answer i phoned and was told that there was a problem with the website which_meant i couldn_'_t select a day .
M	lovely good value blinds well made .
F	very quick delivery , and they keep you informed via_email .
M	if all that wasn_'_t bad enough , the driver had given me the clipboard with all the names and addresses of his jobs for that day - major breach of confidentiality .
M	the item wasn_'_t available on lindy international .
M	a great range of useful products .
M	should i require further door furniture it is a certainty i shall use them again .
F	in less_than 00_hours many of the flowers had died although it had been kept in perfect conditions . i emailed iflorist twice . no answer . i phoned them and was told that no calls were being taken and that i should email them again . which i did . no answer . i tried to live_chat with them . no answer .
M	he then asked for my signature , showed me how to tighten my bolts properly and was on his way .
F	thanks
M	downside . google_chrome !
F	fortunately , the order wasn_'_t urgent , but there would have been a problem if it had been .
F	can '_t fault it !
F	it really is true " you get what you pay for ".
M	what makes me so angry is if i had not started_using the self checkout service i would have never noticed that the items i bought on offer were not on offer at all .
M	i needed some more memory in a hurry for my fairly old acer_laptop .
F	good service from chemist_direct with prompt delivery and at a very good price .
F	i was happy with an overall quality but unfortunately outer_packaging arrived damaged which affected corners of the book .
F	i wouldn_'_t rush back to this villa for the price we paid .
M	as a book provider the site i go to regularly forgets you and keeps asking for id .
F	if i had known the instructions would not have been clear on my parcel , i would probably not have ordered from you .
F	secure site and items well_packed for delivery .
M	i rang straight_away and said how dare they threaten me when its their problem , they apologised a lot said they made a note on the account and then told me they would send out another bag and that they made a note on the account .
F	she guessed , luckily !
F	i will happily_recommend viovet to all my friends .
F	brilliant .
F	i had upgraded to the deluxe display and thank god i did as this was no where near worth the £_00 i paid so goodness no '_s what the £_00 . 00 bunch would have been like .
M	they have an l and a r etched into them to identify on which crank to fit them .
M	i '_ll definitely be using hottub diy again .
M	i emailed them on the 00th and received the follwing reply : thank_you for your email .
M	i '_m told it was paid to someone_else ?
M	000_% recommendation to everyone
F	i know kids will be delighted .
M	however , companies can claim_against all reviews that don_'_t put an order number !
F	after a lengthy discussion we were left with the impression that we were the only people to have ever questioned_why an advertised delivery time of around a week should magically turn into a minimum of two_weeks .
M	the fuel we pay for a small car is outrageous and really pushes the price up so if you have any say in this , please , please try to stop the car_rentals from charging so much .
F	communication was great , i was given a time and date for collection .
F	at 00 . 00 i call .
M	courteous and friendly staff and will not_hesitate to use them again .
F	order delivered on time , well_packaged , and very friendly , helpful staff .
F	after not replying to weeks worths of emails asking when my tickets would be delivered on the afternoon of the day of the paolo nutini gig , just a few hours before i was due to set off , i finally received a reply telling_me that in order to get my tickets i would have to meet the seller at the event venue .
F	looking_forward to our next trip x
M	utrolig dårlig service , telenor har ved flere lejligheder gjort det klart for mig , at de er fuldstændig ligeglade med deres kunder .
M	i have no_hesitation in recommending xupes and i look_forward to doing_business again in the future .
M	i would recommend it as an item that does the job but you get what you pay for and spending more may get you a better quality one .
F	don_'_t throw it away you never know when you may need it again .
F	gear0music staff were very helpful and the goods were delivered promptly and safely .
F	was dissapointed this time round because since our last booking in feb its changed , we like to book straight_forward short_stay park . now it is do you want to surface park ???
M	myprotein is a company that made a niche in the market by giving discounts on buying in bulk .
M	even_though this was their fault , had to waste another day waiting for delivery .
M	simple and very effect to use , the website was a breeze .
M	but as said previously extremely good service , would definitely recommend this firm for quality and delivery second to none .
M	do not specify your costume size enough
M	top_marks .
M	i will_continue to use mytyres for as long as they are in business and as long as i need tyres !
M	i ordered two crewe photobooks .
M	we ordered a massive roll of cardboard .

F	i ordered and paid for the shower and received confirmation could collect monday .
F	jane robertson
F	no compensation offered just an early delivery on the day !!!
M	after a couple of weeks shimano rejected the warranty claim however .
M	site a little_slow to use and lacking maps to assist with hotel locations , but fairly competitive in terms of pricing .
M	the whole order was delivered in one package on 00th_december but when i opened it up , the nike class wov suit in navy / blue size medium tracksuit was missing the trousers .
M	now the strange thing was that the motherboard had free delivery so i thought that by adding the memory to it would also count as free delivery , but i was shocked as the delivery went up to over £_00 , if i had ordered them separately i would have got free delivery on the motherboard and paid just over £ 0 delivery on the memory . there great prices which are some of the cheapest around are really let_down by there delivery charges , so for me only 0_stars , get your delivery charges sorted_out and it would have been 0_stars .
M	i entered an online order for valentines_day roses in madrid - no confirmation_email and not able to retrieve the order online .
F	thank_you
M	as this was my first experience of arranging_collection and delivery of items from another country back to northern_ireland i was a bit_unsure of how the project might work out , but i discovered quite quickly that i was dealing_with people who knew what they were at .
M	couldn_'_t ask for anymore , i would definitely recommend mr_memory to my friends .
M	it doesn_'_t take a fraction of the time on the dover - calais ferries .
F	rude_unhelpful . hanging up on me for asking why they would send out faulty electrical goods . i have never ever_encountered such rudeness and nastiness from a company , go and learn some customer service skills from amazon !!!
F	useless company with less_than poor customer_relations .
F	on realising that the item wasn_'_t suitable , i had to send back .
M	if others act the same way either they will lose business and be forced to improve or go under .
M	!
M	i will never use this company again .
F	i was told it was booked but then they let_me down on the night .
M	simon smith 00000 000 000
M	i now have a replacement_remote and £_00 quid that i would have paid to my management company if i hadn_' tlooked up easygate .
F	some great offers , wide_variety .
M	ordered and checked status which said completed on 00 / 0 / 00 .
F	sadly , i would love to be one of the many customers whom are delighted in their reviews .
F	i love it !
F	monies was in my account the same day they got the phone . will use everytime :)
M	however you need to be careful because enterprise actually did not reserve the deposit on my card , but actually charged 000_euro on my card .
M	not a credible review site for business or consumer .
M	never going to happen .
F	they find a variety of pupils which is fun .
M	will update when i have received a reply .
M	yodel pretended to deliver , gave invalid cards and returned item back to makro ( after i had complained to makro ).
M	called ' service .
M	super_fast ebay despatch
M	tried to rip me off for some work to be done .
F	so asked for its return .
M	o único aspecto negativo foi a embalagem .
F	prompt delivery and excellent value .
M	still cant_believe why i . m getting the same tyre £_00 less_than the
M	great product at a competitive price .
F	the delivery service was second to none , it was extremely prompt and the items were packaged well .
F	be warned they will take ages to answer your communications , make you wait for weeks before they deliver your goods and will not reply to you if you need to return items - apart_from to tell you not to contact them again as they are dealing_with it .
F	excellent service
M	i got an email back telling_me what their policy was as if that was a genuine reason_why they couldn_'_t carry out a simple recovery operation for lost tickets as and when circumstances necessitated .
M	the woman , mandy , seemed not to care and passed me through to the ' customer_care ' team .
F	never promise something that you cannot achieve .
F	this was of course good , except that what i think it meant is that when i asked them to remove the product that was causing the late delivery thus delivering my order sooner , it was forgotten / ignored / idioted .
F	communication to check order was quick and it was easy to confirm .
M	please boycott them and shop elsewhere .
F	frustrated by the amount of codes etc that don_'_t seem to work - i asume you can only enter one code per order , but that isn_'_t stated .
F	not enough variety .
M	i got htc to email regenesis with the phone details & still i only got paid the lesser amount this is not acceptable
F	if you have any further questions we will be happy to help you ."
M	my second email was more specific relating to an estimated delivery but again received a response informing_me that they could not give an indication but as a gesture of goodwill they would expedite the order at no extra_cost to me .
F	they have a wonderful selection of customizable products and the products are high_quality .
F	from our point of view , when customers are waiting for goods , having to tell them we have no idea where their goods are and it could be some days until we know is frankly unprofessional and embarrassing .
F	some of the tiles however were damaged when they came but after_contacting w & f they replaced them promptly and were much_better packaged than the first lot .
F	the price was comparable to currys ( who i hate giving my hard_earned_cash to - rubbish cm service ) and i couldn_'_t find the model i wanted cheaper elsewhere .
F	absolutely_disgusted , and will be writing to the retailer to say that i will not be ordering from them again if they continue to use hermes .
F	my partner had a mobile internet contract with them but since_moving in with me had no need for it .
F	good communication up to the point of dispatch .
F	i purchased these for a birthday_present .
F	when i asked to be contacted back by sales by lunchtime today to confirm a refund would happen , was told not possible and it will now take 0 - 0 working_days for a refund .
M	i have tried to make contact on several_occasions as they have no phone contact i tried via_email and fax to no_avail .
F	very good prices and range of products .
F	i was impressed with the speed of the delivery but was dissapointed that it was the wrong part even_though the web_page said it was compatable .
F	the delivery charge for same day delivery was only 0 pounds more than a future delivery ( flower delivery in the us is * way * more_expensive ).
F	excellent product , fab customer service and speedy delivery . would recommend 000 #
M	i bought a korg digital_piano lp 000 from music_matters .
M	happy to use again
F	as you can see i have posted my ref_number numerous_times i have included it in this review , i have mailed it to trust_pilot 0 times_now and had no response - they clearly don_'_t want to post negative_reviews and will remove this within minutes of it being up .
F	the products have always arrived the day after ordering and the quality is fantastic .
F	i had stopped using hungry_house after such poor cusotmer service - a few_months latter they send my a 00_%_off voucher so i thought i '_d give them another chance .
M	you ' re completely informed_throughout the process .
F	never any_problems with this company .
F	website was easy to use , items arrived quickly and as_described , i would use again .
F	they cut_off my father '_s phone for non - payment when he had just come out of hospital .
F	would you like a refund ?"
F	i '_m only a novice but the staff were very helpful and i really felt that they had the time to spend answering all my questions !
F	.
M	half_dead , dry and colourless , they were possibly the worst bunch of flowers i have ever had the misfortune to see .
M	the trousers were not quite the right size and following a phone conversation with a very courteous and helpful lady at " my tuxedo " these were exchanged immediately and without_any hassle .
F	i had a great time on my bike tour to versailles .
M	i have been bombarded by non sense letters asking to pay bill of an address that i have never lived at neither i have even been to such place .
M	very good website , smooth_transaction , excellent price and delivery was quick .
F	i asked what my order number was and was given a different number to the one i was given upon ordering .
M	also , i '_ve also thought that a buyer could defraud a seller by claiming they returned an item when , in fact , they just returned some garbage so they can provide paypal with a tracking_number .
M	0th_jan - i see spoiled brat have managed to respond to this review but have negated to accept their error .
F	the organiser is rude and has no customer service skills whatsoever .
M	the most unprofessional company it '_s ever been my displeasure to deal with .
M	this is a complete and utter scam .
F	i had been shopping around trying to find buckwheat after it was reccomended on the phase one diet by doug kaufman .
F	so i '_ve spent £_00 and have no flowers !
F	packaging was very nice .
M	as it says it does_exactly_what it does on the tin .
F	unfortunately despite waiting all day it did not arrive .
F	i can see from other reviews that where there is an issue , the ' customer service ' department seems to be tasked to defend their position , rather_than actually provide any customer service .
F	the package also came super speedy despite not ordering an express delivery !
M	then this is the company for you !
M	then i think they changed the recipe a bit with the v0 , but they ' re showing more clearly what is in a serving ( e . g .
M	i ' d advise several careful time & date recorded photos of a car '_s condition prior to hire .
F	it would appear they are ignoring me .
M	ever_since the hut_group took over this company customer service is terrible , scam_artists !
M	best anywhere but the free transit over min .
M	in the end i settled for slim lens bifocals . and they are awesome for driving . result !
M	excellent prices and service .
F	i know that if i '_d rang any of my local suppliers , i '_d have had the oil delivered in 0_days max .
M	was kept up to date with the order process .
F	have always received a great service from partyrama .
M	do not use this firm .
F	keep it up !
M	if i find a alternative to your whey i will take it .
F	however , this is the second time i have used company and there appears to be a problem with courier .
F	again , still no reply .
F	was so quick and easy !!
F	i came back at 0pm expecting to be turned away because it was too late in the day , but they greeted me with a cheery welcome , and got on with it straight_away .
M	delivery did not come until after 0pm by which time i had left for work .
F	well_done everybody .
M	: d
F	they were not quite the colour i was expecting from the picture online but they looked good quality so i tried them on .
M	it was delivered to me at no extra_cost within 0 days of ordering .
M	they never advised me it was only because i contacted them that i found out .
F	not answering any of my questions .
M	000 / 000
M	spent £_000 .
F	we believe they never came at all .
F	not very satisfactory .
F	update 00 / 00 / 00 : continuing to have problems with any delivery by myhermes , and suspect it may be the same driver each time .
M	agreat purchase , thank_you .
F	ecigwizard has_been an excellent company to deal with .
F	also as we are pensioners viovet are saving us a lot of money compared to the vets bill .
F	the best of it was that the email they sent me very conveniently went into my spam email and because i never saw it or had chance to respond within their timescale my phone was then recycled and there was nothing i could do except accept the lower amount .
M	the confirmation_email never turned_up so i rang customer_services .
M	could not have been any quicker .
F	then i received an_email_saying my reply was in a queue and i had to be patient !!
F	i was over the moon when i saw there home_trial option , so selected 0 pairs to try .
M	they were pleasant , tidy and efficient .
M	the pressure to take higher insurance premium is not necessary and is time_consuming , it is accepted that people should understand what they are getting .
M	use to be good now it '_s biased rubbish run by idiots
F	would 000_% recommend
M	previous service was outstanding , unfortunately this time the rose ordered was lifeless and died within 00_hours of receiving it , even_though in a vase of water which was part of the order .
F	the flat was clean and functional but we did feel it lacked personality .
M	company made a fantastic next_day delivery promise which was unbelievable , unfortunately flowers were looking a little damaged on arrival , and even_though i had the room temperature water waiting , fed them with food provided , flowers did not respond , and after 0 days , they already looked ready for the compost .
M	i have no_problems with any post from any other company .
F	quidco is a great site , easy to use .
M	received an email from yodel stating it would be delivered on saturday .
M	very disappointing and log drawn - out process
F	i have used this company before with mixed outcomes and would go elsewhere if i could find an_alternative , economic source of a wide_range of lamps .
M	when i made a special trip to the store that evening it was not there .
F	would definitely recommend .
F	the roses were totally wiped out and the others flowers were ugly , looked very old .
M	beware that first_class delivery can take up to 0 days !
F	site was straight_forward to use .
M	they said they would not go up and kept banging against wall and banister to prove their point .
M	gumtree needs to more accountable to sellers .
M	i ordered believing the item to be in stock but after it failed to arrive , several days after the advertised delivery date , i phoned to be advised that the item was a special order and would take longer .
M	i '_ve reinstalled minimal software monday_night and system mechanic didn_'_t reveal any_issues , so here '_s hoping ?
M	excellent service and delivery speed .
F	i ordered a summer bouquet for my friend , which should have been delivered by courier on friday .
F	the phone still charges but it takes a lot of jiggling to get the plug into the phone due to it being at an angle now .
F	all i '_ve received are numerous polite apologies .
M	could not fault cheapsmells , they offer such a wide_range that you can '_t help but find the one you want .
M	on another site i ordered 0 products from germany and they all arrived within 0 days .
F	well this is where the problem starts .
F	i still cannot_believe that you are questioning that this product is faulty and surely if you run a baby_equipment business selling products of this quality should cause you serious concern , not fight to protect this product .
M	un completed / or half information not saying full information , ones you brought deal with only half information , you will nothing left_behind then cray , even you can '_t cancel the deal this that want tell you on first
F	they offered amazing support and attention to detail .
F	make the extras clearer - difficult to find baggage_allowance etc
M	they always deliver quickly and their prices are extremely competitive .
F	after looking through many of the reviews on here i see that a lot have been removed and mostly only excellent ones remain .
F	turkey .
M	very expensive .
M	totally immoral website that has no care for others .
M	having retired from engineering services , i have seen at first - hand the damage a fire can do and how quickly it can get out of control both in a domestic environment and in a vehicle .
M	sales staff were polite and knowledgeable .
M	i ordered 0 items at the same time , 0 of these items i waited weeks for to be despatched but they said they couldn_'_t take the money from my card , so i went online and hit resolve , entered my security details and all went through ok .
F	after_speaking to my mum later in the week i was told that half of what was left had to be thrown out on the wednesday and by friday they were all gone .
M	i guess you get what you pay for .
F	thank_you tree specialists !
F	i did not feel like ladyminute cared_about me as a customer and i won_'_t be using them again !
M	while i was on the phone with them , the deal done !
M	see_above .
F	i '_m waiting on the delivery of a new mobile phone ( not an i - phone ) that was arranged to be delivered yesterday , but no - one was in to sign for it so i got a sorry we missed you card which is fair_enough .
M	if you are thinking of using tesco direct '_s collection service , don_'_t bother !
F	would use again .
M	the card looked great but the layout of what i wanted written inside was very poor which was a let_down .
M	i order for the first time from this company on the 0th_feb_0000 .
F	however the bag elastic snapped the second time i used it so now no sac , which kind of defeats things .
M	what is wrong with giving a full_tank and return full ?
F	they have what you want with easy size_guide quick secure online payment great delivery options and they text when they ' re on there way .
F	a set of photographs showing damage_caused and a decorators quote for £_000 .
F	love viovet and their whole service .
F	once again , a large company that does not seem to understand that customers live down small lanes in rural_areas that do not conform to the usual rules of satnav .
M	i order 0 rolls of knauf earthwool and left instructions that is no - one was in it was to be left under car port at the side of the house .
F	as i was on the phone fighting for my full_refund ( they wanted £_000 charge ) i searched for the same set elsewhere .
M	i have no problem with the arranged booking .
M	product was good quality and was as expected as i had previously tried the product on in store .
F	just wasted £_00 - 00 .
F	but , why is there no general ' contact us ' feature ?
F	cake boxes were ordered on 0th_november and were delivered on 00rd_november , the day before the wedding !
F	i found your all purpose wonder wrap supported my foot quite well
F	hopefully won_'_t be much longer before i receive the two outstanding products ,
M	the experience was fine but the only down_side is that there was no paper recipt sent with my boots , other than that it was fine . have emailed them twice for a printed recipt to be sent out by post but nothing yet , so the jury is still out .
F	been in o0 shop today at blackpool worst service ever .
F	good company to deal with .
F	ordered 0 items , which arrived quickly , with no postage .
F	they keep you updated with offers and great deals tailored to you .
F	i used the trial_frames feature so that knew my glasses would look fantastic .
F	i immediately tried to amend the order as per the website but was told the order had already been dispatched so could not be changed .
F	addition 0 . 00 . 00
M	it makes me wonder_how long the products will lady .
M	0 ) good customer service 0 / 00
M	then found my booking on the airline site .
M	disgrace .
M	fast efficient service
M	i sent a glass hob via them , and it was smashed in transit .
M	the trophy was poorly made .
F	ordering was very easy and my item was delivered the following_day .
M	i phoned kenable and they were very helpful and appologetic and said we would get the delivery via a different courier .
F	not good value for the price i paid for them , i could have bought plain ones for a fraction of the price .
M	i find the whole_experience of dealing_with t / r easy and the end_result is always
F	spotlessly_clean , well_equipped with everything you could_possibly_need , including a pool_table , wii , ipod_dock and even a bath on the balcony !
M	never again !!!!
F	an e_mail telling_me the replacement goods were on their way arrived the day after the goods were delivered .
M	been with o0 for a quite a few_years_now ( mobile_phone & broadband ).
F	we tried a four wheeled rollator which was fine in the house and in town where it was smooth but useless elsewhere and had to be lifted over kerbs and door threshholds , not the best for someone without balance .
M	always arrive quickly and in good condition with extended sell by date , great prices .
F	very pleased with our new chair .
F	tried to organise a treasure_hunt for a hen_weekend in manchester through them .
M	the second rimless are of poor design , they fall off my face with any gesturing and when slightly knocked ; too loose fitting !
F	thanks alot_easier to read .
M	the staff in the ayr branch were very helpfull and the items were delivered very quickly .
F	i really do like using amazon as it is cheap , has quick deliveries to the north_east of scotland ( and doesn_'_t charge you extra for it ) and the products are of a very good quality . but . what is not helpful is the use of the market place in amongst all the amazon things .
F	however , my second experience with them turned_out rather good .
M	the order was very prompt to arrive and i have no issues associated with transair .
F	the blind arrived very quickly after ordering .
F	i was told that the order would be delivered to a fitter who would in turn deliver it to our fitter who was due come on thursday 00th – only for a box of parts to be delivered to me on wednesday 00th .
F	0 .
M	i placed my order for a few beer_kits and a fermenting barrel with a tap on the 00th_september .
M	what more do you need !?
F	it was a wonderful holiday and i have no_hesitation in using blue_chip again and in recommending them to friends and relatives .
M	those frames are also discontinued .
M	0 .
M	easy to use , easy to order , speedy delivery , will use again without_doubt !
M	excellent quick service
F	so after all the lies that i have been given about the flowers being signed for by someone at my mums house , they arrive dead !
F	when i ordered the ramp in question it was not out of stock but was when my order was received .
M	while i have absolutely no_complaints about the posters i received , i was disappointed by the customer service .
F	ordering , supply and delivery all great , couldn_'_t be better .
F	as for compensation ?
M	the communication was excellent throughout and our goods delivered safe and sound .
F	it took several telephone_calls and emails before the issue was resolved .
M	topcashback offer reasonable deals across a range of companies .
M	- the web_page for managing the insurance claim is appalling ( no immediate feedback when uploading docs , status of claim does not always get updated and no email_notifications - you have login and check progress , even if they are waiting on you )
F	excellent service .
F	i ordered a nest of tables from argos about 0_weeks_ago .
F	easy ordering , super quick delivery with one hour delivery slot text to you .
F	she then tried to contact the driver unsuccessfully + the depot also unsuccessfully .
M	if they had told me it was out of stock , i would have chosen another without complaint .
M	good communications about the product and delivery and then the unit shows up bang on time .
M	beautifully simple interface , where one only enters the vehicle_registration_number to receive a selection of suitable tyres .
F	busy advertising lies !
M	i have no doubts that orbit_print would have rectified these issues had they received the canvas back - but unfortunately i can '_t provide feedback on this .
F	very pleased with it and the service .
M	i wonder_if i will be able to claim my next voucher ?
M	i chose standard delivery and the cartridges arrived the next_morning .
M	but the delivery process was quite ridiculous and i had to take a day off work to be there when the parcel arrived .
F	hotline said leave it to us we will dispatch another order to you immediately - guess_what ?
M	my experience was at evans_halshaw ( nissan ), wessington way , sunderland sr0 0rl
F	it was without a remote_control and this was the cheapest place to buy an official one from .
M	but on top of that , by the end of my phone_call , no one has ever been able to help or resolve my issues !
M	for instance with this delivery the ties ordered was wrapped in tissue_paper whereas if you purchase from the stores they arrive in tie wallets to better protect them , the same experience with some of the other purchases such as the belts , where one looks_like the leather on this is damaged .
M	placed an order .
M	shame about the customer service .
F	j ' ai_commandé 0 articles et_la_commande a été livrée en deux fois .
F	the delivery guys were very friendly and extremely_helpful .
M	happy with the service and the car .
M	best regards ,
F	the next time i checked my emails there were two saying that they believed i tried to purchase flowers and there may have been a technical problem and i could also get 00_%_off .
F	rude , clueless and down right insulting .
F	the sale process was just awful - the salesman kept making mistakes , overcharging me , then not really understanding the credit terms and conditions of the sale which_meant he got one wrong , and made false allegations that it was free credit when actually it is not , as there is a charge of £_00 or so on repayment .
F	i was looking for a double_buggy for when my second child is born in jan , but found it cheaper on another website , precious_little_ones was very easy to do a price match and better that price .
M	highly_recommended .
F	extra large 00 / 00 i dont_think so , and the halo was wonky !
F	never approach this estate_agent i have contacted the police and watchdog .
F	it has made listening to the radio possible again , as alzheimer '_s has progressed , with the radio station and volume preset and controlled with one button .
M	keep_up the good work .
M	i see you have a fine selection of malts and i have been very satisfied with your prompt , easy to deal with approach and i shall_certainly be buying from you again .
F	a number of offers were also enclosed which may come in handy .
M	in my opinion , i could have just bought all the items seperately and it would have cost the same .
F	when i told him about the flat_tyre i was given he was also in complete dis belief that they had a left 00_yr_old self_employed girl with a flat_tyre .
F	it was easy to organise the parking and the parking was conveniently_located to the airport_terminal however when i returned , after a long day , i had to request assistance to be let out because ( i presume ) the exit_barrier didn_'_t recognise my number_plate .
F	very dissappointing
F	the trip itself was ok , i upgraded to commodore class and as it was my husbands_00th_birthday and also decided a couple of days prior to book a meal in the steak house and take_advantage of the pre_- book discount .
F	flowers good , when i went to make final payment i had clicked to pay and for unknown_reason i had bought a butterfly card , i had ticked free card , sent 0 emails no response . want the £ 0 . 00 . refunded , as not what i wanted .
F	excellent service , would definitely use again .
F	bought a ceiling rose from this company .
F	ridiculous .
F	made for us , shipped the next_day and arrived when required !
M	well_structured and easy to use website .
M	the attention to detail was good .
M	duh is it me or is this just a sales catch to get you buy the insurance !
M	e_- mail confirmation is quick and a tracking_number provided , which is useful .
M	also , the lack of an assistance button sign apparently was because the label must have fallen_off . on both machines ?
F	i tend to go for the cheapest price but the parcel is still delivered in a few_days .
M	delivery was quick and secure .
M	bought a product ages_ago and i kept calling up and one would answer .
F	( oops , i think that was a complaint !)
M	always delivered on time , always in great condition .
F	i emailed kiren_parcelhero to ask what was going on , but received no answer .
M	but living in leicestershire and sending to the isle of man i have no idea weather they have got there .
M	!
F	the first few nights i did not sleep very well but , after_reading other positive_reviews , i persevered with it and am now very happy with it .
M	in any case , you could argue me plowing through crowds of pedestrians would save time driving through town it doesn_'_t make it the right way to do it .
M	cdw is only covered with worldwide plus , so i ' d have had to pay extra for this .
F	unfortunatley the cake was not delivered , which was a great disapointment as i received 0 really good emails , 0 to say they were on the way and the other to say they had been delivered .
F	friendly and efficient service with good advice both directly and from the forum .
F	they were always easy to contact , and got back to us very quickly with any_queries .
M	my experience was not good with this company .
M	easy to use website .
M	very reasonably_priced and very quick delivery thank_you so much
M	spoke with a lady_called raj who told me that we had to go onto the system and cancell the order , which we did , that was last tuesday , today we call them again only to be told that payment has_been sent to my account for £_000 , after a long chat raj told me that she would give me their account details so that i could put the money backm into their account .
M	the worst back to ocado for me .
F	i sent an_email enquiring if qs_supplies had a briston tap in stock .
F	will definitely use the site again .
F	anyway , i received an_email from a different person from groupon asking for my paypal transaction details so that they can locate the payment which i gave to them 0_days ago and still nothing heard back .
M	i have had to result in writing a letter to them threatening_legal_action !
M	what you say on your website is what you deliver .
F	after being told i couldn_'_t have the machine i " bought " online , tried to sell me a more_expensive one .
F	if you choose the tracking_number option , you will need to request in_advance or right after you receive the shipping confirmation , unfortunately it can '_t be sent automatically .
M	i then didn_'_t bother to redo the review , although i kept the e_- mails to remind me to beware futeko in the future .
M	brother suggested fitting a pipercross filter
F	advised i wanted it delivered in the afternoon .
M	i '_ll be honest , my experience of ordering from thedrinkshop . com could have gone one of two ways .
F	only then may talktalk realise that they have to stop this appalling customer service .
F	not really !
F	the item i ordered came pretty fast , good customer service , i would buy again .
M	i was looked after from first enquiry through to a very prompt delivery .
M	ironically the plants are coming from a company called gardening_express !
F	we are very satisfied with the table and chairs we ordered but i am afraid the delivery team need some lessons on being polite , they were very abrupt and i realise they are on a tight_schedule but a few manners go a long way .
M	on ebay the item had showed 000 sold . not for that price .
F	flowers were sent half_dead and very small , ordered balloons but they didn_'_t even turn_up .
F	i bought a twin_pack of ballycastle hot toddy from my local aldi and discovered that the ingredients are described as " a warming sweet hot toddy blended with smooth triple distilled irish whiskey infused with lemon and spice flavours ".
M	by tuesday the called me to arrange delivery for thursday and they delivered at 0 :_00am for a 0am to 00pm delivery slot .
F	however
M	the website was very easy to use and the products came promptly once ordered .
F	i telephoned to place an order for my friend to be delivered last friday ( same day delivery ) as her father had passed_away the previous night .
F	he would have preferred it if the car had been waiting for him - but , having said that , it was much_easier for him than having to get a bus and remembering where the car was !
F	the company then went on to say if i unlocked the phone ( at a cost ) they would up the quote by £_00 .
F	the whole_experience to date with pc_specialist has_been very positive .
F	can '_t ask more than that .
F	sent two phones to sell on behalf of our small school
M	i will simply echo the comments already made , rubbish amazon rental service portal , poor turnaround of disks ( lucky to get one movie a week ), far too many recent titles not available , rubbish video_streaming as now 0 / 00 movies are additional_charge etc .
F	my order was fulfilled with the wrong_size so i asked for a different pair - the wrong_size was sent the second time - third time they were correct_size - but it took nearly 0_weeks !
M	the company sell aftermarket product in my opinion , 0 of my items had marks , 0 had a hole in it as if they were seconds , they replaced the items in question but no apology .
F	preferring was simple , the things i ordered came quick but there were things missing of my list .
M	the website says it takes 00 days to moscow and customer_services have told me that once it leaves the uk there is nothing they can do to find my parcel and i have to contact the russian postal service myself .
F	the vacation was well put_together by the rickshaw_travel team .
F	very dissatisfied .
F	i have now been contacted my numerous other ultimate appliance customers who all have similar stories to tell .
F	especially as another 0 upgrades in this house this year .
M	i flew to biarritz and they weren_'_t that cheap ( when all taxes etc were added ).
F	sorry luton , not the best experience for meet and greet .
F	would i order again ?
M	further to my previous review and where the delivery of my sons pool_table proved to be a disgrace even after the promise of set time delivery failed abysmally it eventually arrived on the 0th arranged attempt by agency driver .
F	box was a little damaged due the weight , 00kg , manufacturer needs to invest in stronger boxes as parts could easily have rolled around in the delivery van .
M	it was delivered quickly .
M	simply one of the finest florist websites you can buy flowers online .
F	very disappointed !
M	i contacted live_chat ( which was only 0 - 0 mins , much_better_than the old telephone service ) but peter the opperator stated he is unalble to change the system generated date !
M	whenever i buy anything new , i always visit quidco to see if they can save me money - its quite normal to find the best insurance via a comparison site , then come_back to quidco to get another £_00 off !
F	my grandson had " lost " all my black croquet balls in our somewhat overgrown garden .
F	i found the site / service given by skypark_secure excellent .
M	great item especially in the hot_weather at the moment , easley storable , good for fishing & walking .
M	one tiny moan . the web - site isn_'_t the easiest to navigate .
F	we were given a lane number which over full and resulted_in us being halfway across the road so that the lorries were very close to the rear of our car .
M	dissapointed with the delivery as i payed for next_day and it didn_'_t come for 0 days .
M	i thought long and hard about whether i should give it three or four_stars , but as the product is ok in my mind rather_than good or great i went for three .
M	this , coupled_with a competitive price means i will coming_back for more !
F	you get e_-_mails saying that the items are not in stock , then you try again and they are .
F	regular e_mails which informed me of each_step of process .
M	two bad_experiences , latest one , order was accepted on site , got a call 00mins later and was told that the order hadn_'_t got through and it was going to take 0 - 0 days to refund it .
F	to cut a really long_story_short , i called them again another two times to be told there had been further delays and that the product would be sent out to me soon .
M	i will never deal with specsavers again .
F	not worth the amount i paid .
F	on both_occasions the service has_been fast and efficient .
M	toilet_pan cracked up back corner .
F	i booked and paid £_00 . 00 online with parcel_monkey to get a parcel sent to coventry next_day on 0 / 0th_feb_0000 .
F	empty shelves .
M	flowers lasted for 0 days then looked dead , despite fresh water each day ,, and cut tips off storks , very dissapointed , wont use this company again ,, girlfriend very upset .
F	ordered from fine_coffee_club for my new krups coffee_machine which recommends nespresso_capsules which unfortunately are very expensive .
F	my contacts were shipped and delivered very fast .
F	i would use them again for insurance in the future .
F	had blinds before from them and they were great , i wanted a small roller_blind for the downstairs_loo , it turned_up , flaws in the fabric , doesn_'_t even roll straight and is a dreadful fit .
F	the ordering process was easy and the delivery super - fast .
F	unable to get an answer on the phone helpline .
F	even_though it looked well_packed , when we came to open it , it had been twisted , presumably during_transit .
F	second delivery had to be 0_days_later .
M	i wanted a pair of single coil pickups for my epiphone sheraton and emailed the gak team to check on availability .
M	just made our last amazon order today .
M	had my order in 0 days .
M	i suspected something wasn_'_t quite right straight_away when i looked at the wheels but by this point the fitter had left .
M	if i could give them zero_stars i would .
F	i '_ve_used allweathers twice to buy outdoor_clothing .
M	will_certainly be making use of cjs_cd_keys again , it '_s a piece of cake to order and get your key and the prices are a bargain .
M	no_longer .
M	recipient delighted with them .
F	the staff were friendly during my conversations with them but unfortunately their promises didn_'_t mean anything .
F	no calling_card was left , so they clearly just didn_'_t attempt to deliver it .
F	never been able to order by the foot before , brilliant idea .
F	i didn_'_t receive any email_confirmation although the goods were received quickly .
F	i mean what do they do ?
M	she of course is delighted with then , but should i have just taken the next_day ones or should i demand a refund ?
F	this shirt never arrived that day or the following_day , foned them up & the numbers hadn_'_t arrived in stock , yeh they hadn_'_t thought to update me .
M	will_definitely by a returning customer .
M	this week it arrived - 0 months late .
F	i bought the iron from go - electrical for £_00 and delivery was free .
M	mm does not pay for “ missing ” items although they were all there when they left me .
F	i then ordered a smaller one because i loved it and sent back the bigger one on a friday .
F	chased on 00 december and recorded_message says closed until 0nd_january .
F	your offer of a refund is unacceptable as we would then be unable to see the commonwealth games .
M	not good for an internet company !
M	was quick and friendly and new pieces were out quickly .
F	it states under the tracking # delivery unsuccessful !!!!
M	ordered some items off the website , 0 hours_later i receive a phone_call stating they will be cancelling my items !
F	pleased with purchase and service .
F	i tried my 00 year_old_son '_s costume on him and noticed it was ripped around the arm and it had a stain on the back . i sent it back for a refund and had an_email back stating that i had done the damage so i would not get a refund . i was appalled that i was accused of doing the damage and that i was not telling them the truth . i have neither a costume or refund now . i will never order from this site again .
M	the cars are cheap and the service is awful they advertise things that are not on the car . you pick the car up nobody takes you around the car to explain how things work all they say is if you drive it away its your problem .
M	i have no issues with the company or service , however the tickets i purchased had a face value of £_00 and had been sold to me at double that .
M	great service fast delivery good price
F	i really will think_twice before using them again . chemist_direct . you are pretty good but your chosen carriers really do let the side down !!!!!
M	used collect_+ whenever it was available and found it very convenient .
F	i entered my phone details on web_site they told me straight_away the value of the phone that was very good .
F	was it the date , time of travel or my preference for an aisle seat ?
M	i recently went to tenerife with a friend and the company gave_me all i needed for a cheap flight and cheap accommodation .
M	your phone will be probably go to a third world country which should help those who cant_afford a new phone .
M	" as soon as possible " the lady said - and that is all she could tell me .
M	amusingly they confirmed early delivery ( 0days_later ) by text . 0 minutes after i left the shop .
F	please be careful when sending in your phones !
M	why did i waste my time and effort buying a quality product from the middleman ?
F	oh and just to make my experience all the more fabulous the eflorist customer service team twice cut me off whilst discussing their lack of delivery meaning i had to call them back .
M	given that the company is based in northern_ireland and i am now living on the channel_island of sark , this really is fantastic service .
M	courier would not take the others away .
F	if a friend asked me about this company i '_d say you get what you pay for , i . e .
F	i had to make another trip to the store to pick it up .
M	was amazed at the price and then with free delivery , wasn_'_t expecting it to be so quickly despatched .
M	i made a cash withdrawal for £ 0000 a week_ago and still_haven_'_t been paid it .
M	easy to use and good value parking , regular transfers to and from the car_parks and terminals , relatively fast check in , excellent refreshment facilities prior to boarding , a wide_range of duty_free shops .
M	forget using mm . once they have your money they don_'_t care about anything_else .
M	i would definitely order from them again .
F	sachets arrived a few_days_later , however they have caused us difficulties in that our pet will not eat any food with the sachets mixed through it , so we have had to go and pay a further £_000 for tablets .
F	ever_since i started parchment_craft just over a year_ago now .
F	ordered flowers on sunday , to be delivered to my mum for her_birthday the following wednesday , as advertised .
M	got my refund but how easy would it have been to just send out the lens and filter and none of this " bad_taste " would be left in my mouth .
F	it '_s a shame because i had nothing but praises for this company , but i feel now that my custom has_become somewhat a bother to these people , even_though i am paying for my pictures to be edited .
F	i took wednesday off work as planned .
M	ordered still not received despite paying for next_day delivery , emailed had no reply mailed again asking were my order is a further day later and another day still no reply and no watch avoid at all costs ,
M	i purchased two flights and was charged in gbp .
M	phone arrived but delivery refused .
M	oh fantastic .
F	it sounded great when i was completing the forms .
F	good morning ,
M	bought descaler this time using a money off voucher .
M	i would have to buy another pair .
F	emailed them first then received a phone_call to place an order .
M	would recommend .
M	it all worked out in the end and the family holiday was judged a success by all .
M	we immediately phoned dom & gen and cancelled .
F	he rang me to tell me but that was quite late in the day , finally it arrived on friday but i had to wait in for 0_days for it !
F	there was no bottle of wine delivered .
F	i would never buy from any other shop again .
F	point000 '_s website is very easy to use and the quality of their pictures are second to none .
M	refund did not arrive until 00st_january .
F	thoroughly_recommend this company as completely takes the hassle out of shopping around for different quotes .
M	i will use this service again & would highly_recommend it to anybody looking for tyres .
F	even_though its a few_years old now , its my lifeline to the world .
F	on sunday 0th_january i ordered a mattress from world_stores and although it said next_day delivery i opted for wednesday 0th_january .
M	will use this company again .
M	do not enter in a dodgy contract with them as they do not negotiate and will set their debt bully boys on you .
F	so sending emails relating to other cases , not replying to emails , having to ask the same question 0 times before getting an answer ( i can provide evidence of such if required ), needing to constantly prompt you to move onto the next stage ( which is the only_reason my divorce was completed in 0_months nothing to do with your service ) that constitutes " no_issues with our service to you " does it ?
M	and if possible a tracking_number . nothing , no email , no advisory .
F	now this isn_'_t the usual company i use , but because my mum had badly broken her ankle i didn_'_t want her to have to start trying to sort_out flowers into a vase , so i thought i '_d see if i could get them already arranged in one .
F	the only_slight_criticism i have is that they were delivered about 0_days after i ordered them the web_site guarantees 0_days .
F	had we realised there was a tiny fault on our original photo we probably would have picked another one .
F	i was highly_recommended animed through a friend who hadn_'_t had any_problems ordering in the past but unfortunately animed didn_'_t live up to my expectations .
F	so that '_s how argos is effecting her financially .
F	i phoned customer_services on 00 september she took my mobile number and would get the right person to call me back , quess what no call !
F	i spoke to hayley , sharday and another rude_woman .
M	ok . so these things_happen once in while , but :
F	hahahaha you gotta be joking , keep trying !!!
M	thought i ' d switch from [_external_reference_] to sainsbury ( beaconsfield ).
M	procook told me that only one bottle acted thus and they would not be refunding my postage as i had not phoned them first for an authorisation_code !
F	i will be ringing her back at two to ask her to check his tracker .
F	dekivered next_day - excellent service - will use again
M	if i had one complaint about gear0music it would be when asking for advice using email , they didn_'_t get back to me , but appart from this minor_issue i '_ve had no other negative issues
M	thankfully my neighbours were in and accepted it on our behalf .
F	order was delivered 0_days late .
F	i had a very good experience and i am glad i had the treatment .
F	i '_m amazed_at how many people they get in this park , so it must make financial sense to them to operate like this .
M	ordered a wrist / thumb support paid extra to have next_day delivery before 0pm .
F	presently i am demanding my money back or will instigate a court summons .
F	so i will be charged or fined for the cancellation which doesn_'_t make any sense since the company cannot keep the price as promised , they shouldn_'_t charge me any penny .
F	i sent my son a personalised bottle of champagne , he had just got a big promotion , and has he lives so far away from home i thought it would be a special surprise for him .
M	fitted 0 tyres on a saturday at the time specified in about half an_hour .
M	no issues with the service what so ever and will use again , as long as the price is right .
M	some friends recommended vertigo .
F	quite_expensive for what you get .
F	really quite disappointed now that i should have chosen to buy with sta instead which is £_00 higher than travel up .
F	the goods were ordered at the weekend and delivered by tuesday .
F	in the next couple of days .
F	i bought flowers for a team member '_s birthday but they were not as ' gorgeous ' as i hoped .
M	de_volgende ochtend direct in ' mijn boekingen ' gekeken , weer was mijn aanbetaling niet zichtbaar , dit gaf mij weer een onrustig gevoel .
F	as a previous customer we had no_problems but others certainly did !
M	thanks
M	however the buttons are exposed and are easily pressed accidentally whilst in your pocket gangelling with your other keys etc .
F	i have been buying from crocus for some years_now , i have read some of the other more negative_reviews and can '_t_believe this is the same company !
M	i '_ve been unable to obtain a refund for a cancelled order and have been palmed off with " we are processing your refund " e_- mails from someone called leslie grant .
F	when i placed an order . which guess_what ?
F	do not use if buying a present for someone .
M	thanks again .
M	" this is exactly_what i want can i pick it up tomorrow "
F	it would seem that unless you don_'_t hound them , you wont get your money back !
M	very good service and very fast .
M	if you speak with their online web chat team , like you ' re doing with me , you will be able to query this with them .
M	no replacement offered just store credit , i complained about having to pay delivery charge again and asked that my original delivery charge be refunded as i did not get a working product next_day .
F	impressive !
M	nice and easy to order from the website , lots of communication including one to say your order has left the building and is on route , 00_hours_later it turned_up at 0pm .
M	dpd didn_'_t even say sorry for the damaged box .
F	the process was easy to follow and the site worked smoothly - the banner was ready in minutes .
F	i am in aberdeenshire .
F	our car dealer was very stressed out with the situation as were we .
M	luckily they refunded the money but this is still absolutely poor .
F	i went to a0 to buy a birthday_present for my brother that cost over_£_000 and was shocked at the disgustingly poor level of customer service that i received !
F	we shall not be buying from here again .
F	the quality of the flowers is outstanding and the sight of them just blows the recipient away .
F	i was even provided with a cup of tea whilst i made my decision !
M	i was disappointed that it didn_'_t come with the file box sections and the price of buying these through you was insult to injury !
M	doing what , i '_ve got no idea .
M	i '_ve just bought a pack of 00 sets of acoustic_guitar_strings .
F	fortunately i am very pleased with the price and quality of my table .
M	but to be fair , beautiful_flowers at the end .
F	the really bad thing for me is the packing .
F	the only_thing that i would mention is that , although this is a ' whole juicer '', you can '_t actually put large fruit or veg in whole , as there is a bit that they call the ' tongue ' that sticks out inside the main feeder tube , so you do have to cut the fruit and veg down a little , which was a little_disappointing .
F	in the mean time we would be grateful to know what action we can take in returning the tablet and receiving a refund .
F	products arrived promptly .
M	cloakroom toilet and cistern set .
F	so many months have now passed by . spring has moved_into summer
F	i habe used them twice_now and the product i ordered on line arrived quickly and the price was very reasonable .
F	well why was there no calling_card ?
M	now they are threatening to hand my account ( what account ) over to a collection company , again despite the fact i have called them to sort_out this mess .
F	the 0th of july .
M	telling all my motorcycle friends not to buy any bike gear before they check out motardinn .
M	i cannot under any circumstances recommend this company .
F	ordered this for my own use at my 00th_birthday_party .
F	the prices are very fair , particularly in comparison to other main florists .
F	it was easy to use and the prices were good .
F	i '_ve gone from complete vaper newbie to happy customer in a couple of months .
M	so $_00 paid in return for which . no flowers delivered , no response to a refund request , impossible to speak to someone as they have no phone number and they send an email 0 days after the flowers were due for delivery saying a building they have previously delivered to does not exist .
M	i have used webuybooks a few_times now and they have always been great and cheque comes through really quickly - very happy with them .
M	only_downside is there constant efforts to change " my ebay " the latest changes included putting the " selling " section on another page , removing it for the general overview page . in context its only one extra click to check your selling items !
M	the service is pretty good .
F	i have ended_up with a tiny quaich which i could not return as it was engraved .
M	when i first tried wearing_contacts i nearly didn_'_t when i found out how much my boots store wanted to charge me monthly for my lenses .
F	i phoned customer_services today ( 00th_feb ) and was appalled by the manner of the staff and the excessive holding time .
F	normally i dont use these services , i '_m a typical ' i '_ll ebay it ' and then never get round to it .
F	reasonable_prices , smooth_transaction .
F	appauling customer service . also says on site on my account not paid . before they say they have !.
M	it '_s also awesome that they have a lot of free or discounted offers when you go to check out !!
F	i found a maggot in a piece of cheese bought from aldi which still had more than a month before it '_s expiry_date .
F	after apparent 0 unsuccessful delivery attempts i decided to contact the company i ordered from . they told me they will arrange another delivery for me .
F	the follow_up for a refund by rickshaw to a segment of our holiday that had to be cancelled by inclement_weather was slow at best , whether it was due to the thailand travel_agent or rickshaw themselves and for that i am very disappointed .
M	my parcel was collected on time and delivered early the next_day .
F	felt somewhat pressured .
F	i love these_guys , such a vast_selection , everything i need , i can
F	excellent hotel and room at a great price , we will certainly use hotel_direct again .
F	i will be coming_back to the uk at the beginning of september .
F	i would not buy fragrance or beauty products anywhere_else .
F	would not use them again .
M	for this reason i prefer to deliver to either my work address or use collect_+ for smaller items , as otherwise it '_s difficult to know when to book a day off work for delivery .
F	wait all day monday . tuesday . wednesday decide to call again and confirm for wednesday .
M	this is simply the only way to dispose of an unwanted_mobile_phone .
F	we are now ordering the high capacity cartridges and will see how long they last
F	the jacket fits_perfectly and i love it .
M	i really do like boden '_s clothing for men - it '_s well made and stylish to boot .
M	special thanks to sam for 0st_class customer service .

M	well_packaged furniture .
M	faultless .
F	i can not print my labels off ??
M	thanks for your response .
F	thanks josh for your help and great customer service
M	donna the rep was magnificent .
M	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 there '_s a help button in the top corner of the page , and it will present you with some questions .
F	pine_solutions you suck !
M	the tesco credit_card is pretty middle of the road in many respects .
F	brilliant !
F	had qualified for a free gift , it was in my basket , however somehow lost it on checkout .
M	i would have clicked 0_stars but the staff were trying very hard and maintained politeness in difficult circumstances and seem to be to well trained in customer service , it is a shame they were not better supported .
M	yours gratefully ,
F	speedy delivery .
M	second time , one pair ok , the second had a crack in the arm .
M	it '_s only a propelling pencil .
F	good overall service .
F	!
M	as i am out of the country at the moment delivery was going to be an issue , i was given a number of options and a date secured where i could guarantee someone would be at home , this not an issue at all and all went to plan .
M	personally i wouldn_'_t even give specsavers one star .
M	i was so impressed with the turnaround from ordering to the item being delivered , i was expecting the item to turn_up in the 0 to 0 days stated but actually came in 0 .
M	i saw what i wanted , and any help requires was attended to immediately .
M	forget trying wae customer_support - they are a joke .
M	worse still , because its tucked_away in the terms & conditions the excuse is that they are only providing a service rather_than goods which means paypal won_'_t refund it either .
F	now they ' re telling_me there '_s no address on my parcel , only the town .
M	easy and professional web_site .
M	ask me again in a few_months !
F	lenstore remind_me when i need to reorder and at a click of a button it '_s done and delivered in 0 / 0_days .
M	there has certainly been no friction , but how can one give more stars on such scanty experience ?
M	you can also cancel rooms without_penalty if plans change .
F	i was not in a hurry for this item so give me the correct information and there will be no problem ,
M	ordered one day , shipped the next , and delivered and put to use the day after that .
M	you can overide the authorisation_code normally by typing in a sequence of numbers ( 000000 ) or letters ( abcdefg0 ).
M	some danish sport aviation colleagues invited us to judge their national championships , but then i got a deeply incapacitating cough and at the very last we just had to abandon the trip .
M	what you laughing at . i had this very same outfit in the 00s . grooooooooovy .
M	will probably search for an_alternative place to get my strings .
F	could have got similar size for around £ 0 . 00 at a supermarket .
F	called twice on 000 number trying to return phone , left holding for over 00_mins each time costing me money .
M	added 0th_april_0000 - the grip arrived this morning and works .
M	needed high_quality batteries both before and after christmas for photographic use .
F	my outfit was dispatched the same day and delivery was very fast , being_able to track my order was also very helpful and the text_message to say my item will be delivered today and then that it had been delivered was fantastic .
M	i '_m as surprised as the next person to find that trustpilot is actually impossible to leave a false negative_review in as the business owner has total veto unless evidence can be provided , hence_why the false positive from the original reviewer was retained !
F	everything else was fine thankyou
M	they helped ease our troubles and the support and advice was first_class we look_forward to a brighter future without the hassles of debt .
F	i was pleased with the quality of the blind but it has completely_different fixings & ends to all my other blinds and has taken me 0 hours to get it fitted as i could not use the brackets from my old blind or use the same drilled_holes which i have done in the past & was also able to do with one i ordered for my bathroom from a different company .
F	even_though it was very hot when we were in lanzarote , i hate going into a freezing pool !
F	its fantastic quality the whole shopping_experience was great .
M	virgin please take_note , as i won_'_t be re - newing my phone with you in future if you insist on using yodel , yodel !!
F	with my fencing i received the nails and a pot of jackure which is used to treat the places where cutting or drilling is necessary , using this also keeps up your 00 year_guarantee !
M	i ordered flowers for mothers_day which is probably why when i opened the box i found squashed flowers .
F	once received they deemed it poor condition and only offered her 0 pounds for it .
F	many people who saw the banner have asked where i got it from and i have given the website address freely and recommended it to all .
M	i shall now add this further info to my trustpilot review as my time has_been wasted even further what a joke !
M	a representative did not contact me at the agreed time nor at all that day .
F	i decided to leave and bought a car elsewhere .
F	i have pictures to show how close the cars were !
F	when i first placed my order with u i realised i had mistakenly_ordered the wrong_size stockings , i emailed direct from the site to see if this could be rectified .

M	when we tried to enter the cinema to watch the film i was asked about the age of my son , who is fifteen_years old and we were told he didnt look old enough , even_though he is the biggest in his class .
F	they offer a returns pick_up and this has_been faulty so they thought they '_d just ask me to go to the hassle of going to the post_office and posting it .
F	we were told on return that this sometimes happens but if this is the case why wasn_'_t this information given ?
F	their customer service is truly shocking .
F	we submitted our measurements online . placed the order and then rang to ask advice on how many hinged etc . we found them very helpful .
F	i had paid for assembly ( and i '_m so glad i did ) and they guys put it together in about 00_mins .
F	a friend told me about the company and she was shocked when the box arrived and said she never_experienced this problem so this may just be a one off .
M	i complained to corporate headquarters and they were worse than useless
M	total rubbish .
M	it is now 0 months since delivery .
F	called the next_day to be told it was out of stock , and they didn_'_t know when it would be delivered .
F	also screws where missing and no instructions for some of the items .
F	!
M	they did what they said they would and super quick too
M	;)
F	having said that , overall , i was very glad to have found them .
M	to be honest i had given up on ever getting the money !
M	sh0t company , sh0t rude staff .
M	!
M	a new low for this company !
F	after that it all went down_hill drastically from there and the excitement we had in the beginning turned sour !
M	this review arrived before my money .
F	to date i dont_think the intended_recipient has received the bouquet .

F	i received notice by email that on wed_00th that my purchase had been sent to me that day .

M	the small catalogue is an ideal source of reference and ideas for the motor enthusiast .
M	bought noise cancellation headphones .
M	tyres at the fitting_centre as promised . i should have checked condition of all four as two absolute neccesity , but other two near the edge . so i miss the discount for ordering four . my fault . one locking wheelnut sheared in half on refitting , leaving stub on bolt & tight . fitters spent considerable time removing stub then told me to order 0 new ones if necessary , & national would refund the cost as car in their care . they were professional & apologised for delay . on top of this they swapped the best two remaining tyres to the rear putting new ones to the front . all at no extra_charge . advice on disc & pad condition given freely & withou pressure . highly_recommended .
F	george michael in manchester - can '_t wait .
M	very happy with service from_start to finish .

M	hugo martins
F	would recommend without_hesitation .
M	he guaranteed my product will be there by monday , and it did arrive on monday .
M	the whole_process was quick and easy .
F	i had to reply back and say that i had said i had not got the email and so did not get the information !
F	however , when i got the cards through the colour looked too pale and the copy looked very slightly lopsided , which is surprising as i have used optimalprint before and not had an issue .
M	i e_- mailed argus on 00 december_0000 and phoned on 0 january_0000 .
F	wrong sizes for both outfits sent .
F	dusseldorf airport - pick_up etc was absolutly fine - but the return was a different_story .
F	both items have fallen_apart , mainly under the arms and at the neck .
F	i ordered 0 seperate deliverys , both came really quickly , i '_m very impressed .
F	as he is too frigging lazy to open the gate right next to where he chucked it over !!
F	things went well until we got to arranging when i was going to get the loan .
F	absolutely atrocious !
F	the orders are normally delivered within 0 - 0_days which is great if you need something quickly .
F	i wanted to ask further questions which i had not thought to ask at the initial interview .
F	staff on the tills are doing their best under poor management .
M	they ' re well priced and good quality , and they deliver quickly and accurately .
F	will not use these jokers again .
F	then at delivery date were were told that one chest of drawers will be delayed until next week .

M	£_00 for 0 months supply of daily_disposable contacts .
F	unreal .
F	when i did get through on phone , your employee was very helpful .
M	although they had my email address the only time i found out about the substitute shower was when it arrived and i queried why they had sent this model .
F	plain simple instructions isnt too much to ask for is it ?
M	think the opinion says it all .
M	i fully checked through the bag but i appear to have only been sent the tracksuit top and not the bottoms .
F	i was thinking i needed to get new nets but hadn_'_t got around to it when i saw some samples you had sent to my daughter - in - law and i liked what i saw so went home , measured and ordered .
F	whilst both lots of flowers have been stunning , each time i have had great difficulty using the amazon discount_code .
F	excellent range of goggles to choose from at very good prices , web_site was easy to navigate and use , a painless purchase and very pleased indeed with the product , considering it was close to christmas when i ordered the delivery came on 00rd_dec
F	assurances that the matter is being expedited
M	this is my first experience of buying from them , and i will not_hesitate to use them again !
M	simples
F	the delivery firm did a good job but they are contracted for kerbside drop only .
M	however the all black pens really just dont stand out .
M	i believe that as a newcomer i am not blinded by any bias .
F	great service .

M	service was good .
M	russ came back to me to say sorry and that there had been a problem with a lens .
F	she quoted me a 0 - 0 week delivery time , despite their website stating within 0_weeks , but i agreed as i explained i had the 0th week off work already so that would be ideal .
F	sure pricing is ok but just so they save the vat they split orders into amounts that are less_than £_00 or something .
F	waited in all day no - one turned_up .
F	ann_summers is great if you get a good product that fits well and doesnt break but the chances are it will be too small or poor quality and then you ` ll have to fight to get your money back !
F	will_definately use again .
M	!
F	i have still not received any call back from serenata .
F	then i heard_nothing .
F	terrible service .
M	£_00 for a room , looks very good but parking and internet add £_00 per night so in reality it was £_00 per night , again not bad but this should be the advertized price
F	perhaps some rugs , maybe pictures or something ….
M	im getting speeds less_than adsl at night and paying for fibre .
F	it was only after calling comfy_living again , and experiencing some attitude from the call_centre agent , that it transpired_that the supplier had gone into_administration and they couldn_'_t supply my mattress .
M	0 hours after ordering our food and receiving confirmation of our order , we contacted the restaurant and they said that no - one had contacted them .
F	the return was booked in too early , i noticed an_error in the departure time .
F	very bad customer service .
F	poor response for a mid - quality product at premium pricing .
M	will_definitely be using mr_memory for all my future ram orders .

F	my husband and i both felt it was a difficult situation but you could of done so much more for those travelling with children and at this special time of year
F	it still took 0_days to be delivered .

M	i will use them again .
F	i was then refunded using the wrong method .
M	!

F	exactly as_described .
M	cleaners didn_'_t come when they should have .

F	it '_s bad enough when they lose items ( how does that even happen ?!)
F	i have contacted national_helpline , they come_back to me straight_away , they were very quick to find out what i need it help with , after that i just got a letter that they want be able to take my case .
F	since then have sent repeated emails and have had several conversations with people who tell me i can expect a full_refund in a few_days time .
F	it has always arrived within a couple of days and i receive emails to update me what time and date it will arrive .
M	it offered clear information , presented logically , with offers and promotions easily visible , without having to root unnecessarily , trying to unearth the right link to the right deal .
M	paid altogether nearly_£_000 for these tickets .
F	they are also threatening to charge delivery even_though they did not deliver .
F	the actual treatment involved about and hour of delay before i finally got to the treatment room so i was pretty nervous .
M	had to take it myself to depot after paying for pick_up from home , not really impressed
M	if you are going to run a big discount month then please make_sure you have the stock to service it .
M	!
M	avoid talk_talk , there so called customer_services are timewasters and their broadband_connection really is worse than dial up !
F	great all_round - particularly good value for switzerland !
F	it is fraudulent and a mis selling of their products .
F	really great service , i was a bit_dubious as i had been searching for this particular item and no - one had it in this country unless you were prepared to pay double or wait weeks for it to come from the usa , so when i saw coolshop had it i was doubtful as i hadn_'_t heard of them - however i went for it and wasn_'_t disappointed !
M	on time with goods will use a gen
F	really easy to do , arrives quickly and results were sent back within 0_days !

F	damage was made to our car and after numerous phone_calls & emails , we are not getting any response as no one seems to be interested in the damaged they have caused to our car .
F	overall a good experience with travel_republic with the organisation of the holiday .
M	i know it '_s cattle class & i should be grateful i don_'_t have to pedal the crappy old planes they fly but i will actually go across the country to another airport to avoid them .
F	having done this i found a quote for £_00 per_month !!
M	surely you could have sourced that item in 0_weeks ?
F	i keep it to what i really need or i would be swallowing tablets all day .
M	wait to see if the company either improves its service to , or fails .
F	apart_from that delivery was fast and product seems great
F	i had called many_times trying to correct the mess they made .

F	i think there needs to be more originations set_up like this one .
F	i had to cancel due to illness .
M	fleece x0 at esmall - couldn_'_t even get my arms in the sleeves !
M	a bit long_winded trying to find my product but once found ordering is easy .
M	i would recommend golfbase to anyone that '_s looking for golf_clothes or golf accessorie '_s .
F	on the whole we were pleased with the quality of our cards , but delivery took one week via second class_post , and i paid £ 0 . 00 for each package i had delivered they both came to the same address on the same day - really not acceptable .
M	first time i have been disappointed really , the service is normally excellent .
M	items are of good quality however but i got sick of waiting and ordered elsewhere and have returned the items from 00mx straight back to germany with their freepost_returns system .
M	ring quality 000 out of 000
M	should have done it years_ago
M	there products are all good manufacturing practice approved and eu compliant meaning they cant be_bettered quality wise .
F	no point putting a lock on as i could pull the bolt of myself !!
M	when put on you can '_t see out of it so walking blind most of the time .
F	great range of products and awesome service with quick answers .
F	i always order my perfume from cheapsmells , best price and free delivery !
F	i can '_t rate this company highly_enough .
F	he knocked at the door , didn_'_t wait and just left the flowers on the door_step .
M	i was acturely put off after_reading the bad review on this page but i decided no i will go for it .
M	god_awful service from dabs
M	there is nothing on the service documentation to suggest a fault had been identified and remedied .
M	yodel : im_afraid the service which we offer is non guaranteed which is stated when booking david . yodel :
M	good afternoon mr brammer ,
F	i recycled all the cardboard but not able to recycle the polystyrene .
M	will never shop there again !!!
M	internet service was trouble_free
M	stay_away at all costs !
M	staff resent without hassle or complaint each time .
M	we look different and feel different because at yodel we truly believe there '_s a better way of delivering .
F	i called up the day after the order was supposed to arrive to find out that the company had run_out of stock of 0 of the items i had ordered .
M	nissan versa should have been camry .
M	i got nearly as many free items as i purchased .
F	even some of their more_expensive products have problems .
F	00 / 00 / 00 .
M	all promises and no action .
F	after another 0_days i rang again and spoke to someone_else who was brilliant .
M	probably - as long as the price is right i can put the negatives down to bad_luck which could happen to anyone so i would give them a second chance .
M	that was more than 000 of the total hire charge which included insurance .
M	nice rug and speedy delivery :-)

M	david : goodbye yodel , one huge let - down , one joke of a company , one parcel sent and one big_mistake .
F	fantastic service from_start to finish
M	customer_services replied initially and told me they would be back in touch once they had spoken to the courier , which they never did .
M	receipts could be more clear and plain .
M	the axminster experience is otherwise good , but i returned the lathe for either an upgrade or whatever .
F	i was very impressed and would like to rate this very highly .
F	the only problems seems to be lack of stock and chosen stores so sometimes when ordering a few items you cannot get them all from same store which is not good as they only hold reserved items until end of the next_day and if you have to wait for another item to come_back into stock it means going back to collect !
F	regardless of whether this woman likes her job or not she could at_least put some effort into it .
F	cannot_fault the level of service .
M	easy to use website very user_friendly , good options unlike_other_sites , helpfull on - line chat_function ,.
M	customer service , however , was very good .
M	these ink_cartridges from cartridge_shop arrived extremely promptly , and appear to be highly satisfactory and certainly excellent value .
F	in theory .
F	they sent me different pillowcase to picture on their website .
M	i got email confirmation that the price i had been quoted was agreed and within only a matter of days the money was in my bank_account .
M	staff helpful
M	you really can '_t get better !
F	only time will tell if they are any better , or worse , than quidco .
M	jokers ' masquerade had lots in stock and i recived the outfit in 0 days , looking though their site i will be ordering again later in the year
F	the bed we ordered is good quality , was easy to assemble and very comfortable .
M	my order came quickly and i am very pleased with my watch , the glow from it at night is the deciding_factor that made my mind up to buy it and it doesn_'_t dissapoint .
F	later on in the conversation when i questioned_why my package hadn_'_t been delivered , he blamed it on royal_mail ( contradicting his previous comments ).
F	the bouquet looked sparser .
M	blackcircles offered the best price , super_fast delivery and great communication .
M	i have called every week and got the same response " we will send you an email in the next few_days confirming your delivery date ".
F	please could you send out an instruction_sheet .
F	i was not pleased by the customer service lady she rang parcel_force she apologised but no compensation or in anyway was i told on how to air my concerns .
F	i would also appreciate that should a company be delivering to a top floor_flat then the delivery charge would be more .
F	i read good reviews for this website so when i found them i was buzzing !
M	the deal went_ahead quickly and the dealer kept me informed all the time while the car was being built .
M	i received all of the goods i ordered very quickly given that they were shipped to ireland .
M	regards
M	checkout was a breeze via_paypal .
F	00hrs came and went and as the recipient had now gone on holiday for 0_weeks , i called collect_+ and i asked for the parcels to be returned to me and asked for a refund of the shipping_costs i had already paid .
F	there seems to be no link to get back to it once you have added an item .
M	!
M	lost a week of time as a consequence , hence the three star_rating - which some might see as generous !
F	flowers arrived and are beautiful .
M	product exactly as_described on website , recorded next_day delivery and a great price .
M	two hours_later no one phoned i phoned again to be told " we are waiting on the warehouse so i have nothing to tell you " where is the warehouse china no cant be i have had items delivered quicker from america .
M	my neighbour told me the parcel arrived on monday - three_days , that is probably what normal free delivery would take ( and did take - with the previous_orders ).
M	we have used serenata for many_years for special occasions when flowers delivered personally are appropriate .
M	the allotted_time - slot came and went and had to contact hughes_direct to find out what was going on twice .
F	unfortunately i then had to wait a week from them accepting the phone to sending the check ( i '_m not 000_% sure why it couldn_'_t be sent straight out ).
F	jeg_har handlet en del på_nettet og altid fået varer leveret til_tiden og_har_jeg returneret noget , har_jeg fået mine penge promte retur .
M	even booked the wrong date and rang them up and they honoured the delivery date i had meant to pick , without charging me as they recognised my genuine error .
F	it isn_'_t surprising i can '_t track my order online if this is the case .
F	the photo on the computer showed a full , colourful flowering plant .
F	they made sure our group walked together , setting a comfortable and realistic ' pole pole ' pace , this was great for morale and enabled_us to get the know each other better and therefore be there for each other on the final day .
F	like many others , tried to sell an iphone 0 00gb , was originally_quoted £_00 and today they '_ve received and tested the phone and due to ' water_damage ' and a very minuscule mark on the screen that i knew about , they now want to offer me £ 0 . 00 for it !!!
F	never will i order from you again , the flowers were near enough dead , the delivery time i asked for never happened i said after 0 clock in the afternoon not 0 clock in the morning , i paid an extra 0pound for it to be an extra big bunch and had a small bunch arrive im not a happy customer , first time ive_ever ordered with you and the last .
M	order process was fine as has_been all information re : progress of order
F	she was out so they were left hidden in recycling bins .
F	hi , if your reading this you must be a buyer of beautiful jewellery just like me .
F	it has everything you need plus it is cheaper and the service excellent .
F	often the orders have been placed late the previous day due to me being disorganised .
F	took a day off work to meet my appointment for the engineers .
F	final gripe : when present , the instructions are just ridiculous , totally_useless - yes i kind of understood the table_legs go under the tables thanks , however there was no mention of the different bits ( washers ) included to actually screw the things in place !
M	spot on
F	good quality and very stylish !
M	even if i follow a link to sales from an email shot sent to me i am not recognized !
F	basically the spa deal never existed , carden park declined it because they had no rooms , so why take my money when deal doesn_'_t exist .
M	great service and price , can '_t fault them at all
M	not set the computer up on my new bike yet but would recommend cyclestore to anyone and will_definitely use them again .
M	emailed but no feedback .
F	then when the van arrived it hadn_'_t been plylined as requested .
M	never mind , they will soon be a foreign_country and will not be expected to know scottish geography !
F	!
F	ordered a christmas_tree on friday 0nd november , i had carefully read the terms on the website before placing my order and it clearly said that the tree would be sent the next working day or if there was any delays that i would be notified by phone or email .
F	website is easy to use .
F	so what happened when we got the delivery details , dpd wanted to deliver on a tuesday .
M	it took 00 calls for customer service ( hahaha ) to actually do something to address my issues .
M	i made a booking with argus on 00 september_0000 for a car with alamo in puerto montt chile on 00 december_0000 .
F	what a story .
F	being quite creative are usually make my own outfits but at the price of this dress i couldn_'_t miss the opportunity a sheet would have cost me roughly the same then add to the mix a belt and headband etc the material is okay quality , you get what you pay for .
M	this is where users from the same native_language could enrol into a class that has a trusted community member ( s ) or a paid busuu staff_member that will help teach the class members .
M	neither happened .
M	£ 0000 . money most definately not well spent .
M	alas , their carrier , tnt in this case , let them and me down .
M	this was unbeknown to me at the time of purchase , although easily_rectified by a quick look through another competing online shopping website * coughamazoncough *
M	after 00 days of hearing_nothing , i sent an e_- mail for an order update .
M	for that i have to email them .
F	hi there , this is the first time i have purchased from shedstore and will definitely be shopping there again , quick and easy transaction , item arrived on schedule and i was kept up to date about my order via_email .
M	however , this time the basket of flowers i ordered as a gift for a relative was " in a very poor state " when it arrived , according to another relative who was there when it arrived ( courtesy of yodel ).
F	no matter_how much i tried i could to load a picture into the january slot .
F	omer cayman et roller speargun .
F	the leggings are great and i wanted to order more , but stock_availability is awful .
M	ive purchased from kikatek on quite a few occasions already , but the other day was the first time ive actually had to contact them after a possible bodged firmware_update for the apn i ordered .
F	i bought a cheeseboard which was personalised to give as a house_warming present .
M	and alot of stress .
F	but i did not get an answer to my complaint .
F	please_avoid them at all cost !
F	my sister lives in burgh le marsh which is approx 00 miles from me and i wanted to send her some flowers for her_birthday .
M	as the parts were dispatched the same day as the phone_call , i can only_assume the original email order was misplaced .
F	i have bought my iams_dog_food from gjw_titmuss countless_times and i would say that 00_% of the time they are the cheapest and 000_% of the time they deliver within 0 working_days , that is why i shop with them every couple of months .
M	after this defamatory comment had been posted on - line , the company then changed it to " not quite true ".
M	phoned alpha_rooms and they had moved us without telling us .
F	despite the bother information on the site was good and very easy to follow .
F	when i called table_tennis tables . co . uk i spoke with a lady_who knew her stuff .
F	delivery took over a week .
M	i am considering reporting them to trading_standards , principally because of the apparent lie .
M	i for one will never use a company who_uses_yodel again and if any yodel courier steps foot on my property again i have told them they will be trespassing and i will call the police .
F	delivery was very fast , and the product was value for money .
F	i questioned if the item was not delivered on time and was told i could just return both , so no present for my dad and out of pocket !!!
M	my only complaint was that i had to pay 0 postage chages .
M	the beer bike was hard work but a lot of fun .
F	wir waren auch beim zweiten mal sehr_zufrieden mit_der buchung unseres mietwagens via cardelmar und es hat wieder alles bestens geklappt .
M	!
M	!
F	they never let_me down .
M	it made me realise that had the outbound_journey not been cancelled we would have enjoyed a relaxing and stress_free start to our holiday as_opposed to what happened .
M	my main problem with my order was that in ups .
M	i have been asked to send further pictures of the roses if i am still dissatisfied .
F	thank - you partyama
F	when i asked how they were able to take my money for items that did not even exist they were not too forthcoming as usual .
F	the process of booking is easy to follow .
M	we are both delighted with the cooker and hope it gives us many_years of good results without the hassle and cost with our previous apology for a cooker !
F	my sister loves her flowers too !
M	no apology , and a 00 mile_round_trip and time off work for me so i had the parts in time for the arrival of the plumber .
F	not impressed at all
F	. the zip on the bag was broken !!
F	maybe i am wrong but now i can ´_t get my ticket because of incorrect adress .
F	he was busy but was told he would phone me back in 0 minutes .
F	if , after a short time chasing , the reply is unsatisfactory or absent , make a claim .
F	however , several days_later and i '_m still_waiting for them to arrive .
M	overall i have enjoyed going through_quidco .
M	i have been using supplementwarehouse . com for a number of years_now .
F	trouble is nespresso is my morning indulgence and i almost don_'_t want to run the risk of not having great coffee to start the day .
M	couldn_'_t fault the service or help over the phone from them .
M	this was a really good price to start with then less_than a week_later they knock another 0er off which is cool for the customer just not cool for me as i pre ordered it .
F	meanwhile there were collect / drop_off drivers waiting for customers to pick_up their vehicles and this often took 00 to 00_minutes or more - we were watching this happen , so understood why our vehicles took so long to arrive .
M	however , most companies are great at taking you money .
F	haha , more fool me .
F	also i go to shop at 0 . 00am and the store is always in a mess .
M	i ordered a waistcoat and when it arrived the quality was pretty poor .
M	i ordered what i originally required with a proper and honest company .
F	the item arrived well_packaged and i am extremely happy with my purchase .
F	however when i took my home to post_office they informed me this information was incorrect and i had to pay 0 . 00 to ensure my 00 . 00 mobile would be insured .
F	i easily found what i wanted and it was at a very good price .
M	at 00 . 00_hours there still in belfast
M	to go and purchase that amount of oil alone , not taking into account the oil_filter and the labour would have cost more .
F	then , on 00th_december , i received another email from music_magpie saying ' we have not received your items , have you decided not to sell ?'
M	it also easy to buy the items that you require , also it '_s also very easy to use checking out and paying part of the web_page .
F	i would thoroughly_recommend this company .
F	they said i wasnt actually eligible for the offers i had originally been promised and wud have to pay the extra £_00 each_month - i would never ever pay this much for a phone contract .
F	had a phone_call to apologise , the reason was that it had been a bank_holiday and flowers were unavailable that day .
M	yes , i am waiting for webcreation_uk to have this negative_feedback removed , how increasingly predictable .
F	i have used your service before and found it great , so was a bit gutted as i am worried the computer could have been damaged in transit by the time it arrived at my door .
F	they also never reply to emails , i had to send the same email 00 times in a row from 0 different email addresses just so 0 person would respond .
F	problem we '_ve had this past 0 or 0 flights is the attitude of the virgin crew on the plane has_been really poor .
F	i have got no complaint about this company , it was exactly how they said it would be :-) good quality clothing delivered when it said it would be :-)
F	!.
M	so he told me to call again on friday .
M	unfortunately i was given a fan which had a fault with one of the wires into the connector .
F	also good device about when to move up a step and products on other_websites which were not genuine environ .
F	waited for the refund and guess_what i only got £_000 back .
M	dont like to be ripped_off .
M	the web_site is easy to use and when i requested a change to my booking , it was done quickly without_fuss .
F	i didn_'_t find them rude as they dispassionately told me about the policy and the process but i did find the whole_experience unreasonable and totally_unacceptable .
M	great company , good prices and items supplied that aren_'_t easy to find elsewhere .
F	when she got back to the office she did find the booking and said she would " try " get a driver to the airport to meet us .
M	the offer came just at the right time .
M	received call back 0 . 00 tuesday_morning , and received helpful advice from pleasant operator .
F	the quality of the finished slate plaque was beyond what i expected .
M	after a couple of trial small booklets , i was very satisfied with the quality of the images inside my latest a0 book .
F	arrived so quickly too .
F	i bought a tabour bathroom unit .
M	today '_s date - without warning .
F	i was surprised that it wasn_'_t a sealed container .
F	first of all , i received no invoice whatsoever upon initially placing my order on the 0th of april .
F	by the 00th_december_0000 it still had not been paid and tesco continued to say - the payment is still being_processed .
F	we relay on your tv area when the play_area is full or when the other children maybe playing to rough for our young_children and not to have a working dvd for over a month !
F	order came 0_days after_placing it , none of the numerous voucher_codes i had worked , including the ones medic_animal sent to me themselves . found a company ( viovet ) who are lots cheaper and deliver first thing the day after_placing order for free .
M	i wouldn_'_t have bought online if there were a local tailor .
M	professional and thorough communications .
F	i thought the results would be better , but i can see alot better_than before however i am still a year on somedays blurry and eye_drops needed .
F	then when i registered my new sim on the phone ( website wouldn_'_t work ) i was told i would receive a text but after 00_hours it hadn_'_t come so i had to phone again !
F	i emailed back , somewhat miffed , saying that i couldn_'_t_believe a company that makes its living from deliveries for special_occasions could be so remiss as to leave something like whether the intended_recipient does indeed receive the order to complete chance .
M	the whole_experience only took a few weeks .
M	great product range and pricing , never had to use customer service so can '_t comment on that but orders are processed efficiently with no delays .
F	or not .
F	what a bunch of wasters .
M	the best price i could_find on the net for a particular osma product .
F	easy to find car_park , as long as you '_ve googled it first !
F	not only this but they were sending leaflets to my house , every one of them i returned to them asking for them to stop .
M	am i entitled to a refund as you have clearly breached your own stated policy ?
M	really good ordered tyres tuesday_evening to be fitted saturday garage rang on wednesday said do i want them done straight_away had them done wednesday_afternoon
M	it also matched my stainless cooker which i was planning to fit it below .
M	!
M	my gripe is that one of the records is warped .
M	very recently , i have noticed a considerable improvement ( it would have been near_impossible to get worse ).
M	salesman was good and helpful .
M	until you realise you simply can '_t be as you are and provide poor and in some cases possibly even criminal service such as blackmailing to withhold refund without just cause , then you '_ll probably still get the ' few ' reviewers who don_'_t want others to suffer as they have !
F	i was told that i should have bought the extra kit and that i would need it in order to plumb in the tray as it was also going on a concrete floor .
F	and where '_s that ?
F	have been going to this company since opening and would never buy my beer stuff anywhere_else .
M	can '_t fault blinds_0go , perfect .
F	not sure what the story would be if we had missed our flight .
M	very useful service but customer service is generally pretty bad .
F	google always has the answer or know where to find it . easy to use and one of a kind .
F	so will certainly have a good look round next time i need to change money .
F	hi i have purchased items numerous_times and are very happy with the service and would recommend u try them
M	also if you wish to make an enquiry you will have the privilege of having to wait in a queue on a premium_rate line .
F	great price , best around .
M	and nobody has time to spend their lives reading small_print , hence_why they have to be fair and reasonable , or the key points notified to customers .
M	i cannot stress enough , buy elsewhere !
M	it was on all the major website .
F	i thought the ordering was so simple from go - electrical and i had the opportunity to
F	deliver was good , was told best way to unpack it , but had trouble as men had bought it in back to front so had to try and change the big box around correctly once it was in .
M	i rang their customer service number and was told they would email me that day with an explanation of what the delay was .
M	many_thanks and i will_definitely recommend and use you again .
M	i requested a new camera charger which i received wrong !
M	i asked for my name to be removed from their list .
M	excellent service and quick delivery .
F	helen took all of our information and said to leave it with her and that she would get back to me .
M	part from that the application , layout and link to paypal option was very good .
M	very happy with service , best price for this fireplace and arrived promptly and packaged well .
F	i found the website very difficult to use - my order was rejected many_times , which_resulted_in my reordering , then my original orders were miraculously reinstated so i nearly ended_up with four times the product i '_d wanted .
M	i receive the shoes and very quick postage it was nice to do_business with you .
M	left my mother waiting all day for them .
F	.
M	great service !
M	a simpler way to do your shopping .
M	we called out homeserve , but while waiting i traced the fault to a leaking pipe under the floor .
F	awful customer service .
F	so i drove out of my way to take_advantage of it .
F	collecting the car was frustrating , collection time was 00am didn_'_t get seen straight way , hard going when you have children with you .
M	if they can '_t get a simple request like this correct it does not say much for the company .
F	attempts to get an answer from head_office have proved futile over the past two_weeks .
F	delivery was speedy .
M	no delivery date has_been given for the arrival of goods despite a promise to e_mail me that day with a delivery date .
M	cheers .
F	thank_goodness he suggested this as i was desperate to get the equipment needed to complete the installation .
F	ordered a mural item was shipped 0_days ago still not received !
F	they told me to input my meter serial_number so it could be linked to my account . they still_haven_'_t linked it . i could go on , but i '_m boring myself !
M	.
M	the products are at market prices , not competitive .
F	i was sent the wrong shower from the one pictured .
F	after this long period of time i '_ve come to the conclusion myself that :
M	!
F	i sent them an_email_telling them my order was incorrect and was told i would be sent a replacement pack .
M	great customer service from my tuxedo and parcel_force ; ruined by interlink_express !
M	out of the goodness of their hearts they did offer me £ 0 off my next order though , as if i ' d ever order from them again to benefit .
F	he said he had a few two - seater sections available & asked if we would like a window seat to which we said yes to both .
F	after_reading some of the comments and being a first time customer from the uk , i must_admit to being rather alarmed and i started to worry that my order would not arrive .
F	eventually , after several emails , i was told my am charge was amended and indeed next_day fast track would be put through on the order but would be next working day after ( i ordered thursday and was advised would be delivered monday as being dispatched friday ).
M	the administrative contact has also changed to @ domainbox . net by the way is a company that
F	the item eventually arrived on the friday .
M	overall an excellent purchase .
F	as i was making my order on the online designer , it went fine .
M	what can i say about printerinks , only a top_class product from a great , easy to do busy with company .
F	they are out to rip people off and i hope they are out of business shortly .
F	i have not received my tiles !
F	i can_honestly_say that it '_s changed my life having_laser_eye_surgery .
M	but after ten_years without_any mole activity , the new lawns have erupted with moles
M	no_problems purchasing the products .
F	would that be possible to do with checkout at pet_supermarket ?
M	i ordered before 0 :_00pm and 00_minutes later got a call from eflorist saying they couldn_'_t fulfil my order as all the local_florists were closing half day .
M	their upbeat website gives the impression of a company that will deliver - and quickly .
F	next time , if i use serenata again , i '_ll just settle for the free delivery and save my blood_pressure !
F	overall not a great service .!
F	contact with the company before delivery was easy and polite .
M	i placed an order for a bed that was advertised as available for immediate delivery for next_day .
M	many_thanks for the easy transaction and video help
F	the delivery was really expensive considering what i had to pay for the costume , however , it did arrive within the allotted_time .
M	never mind , i just preordered my xbox one titanfall bundle from game instead and zavvi have better pre order prices on games .
F	diabolical all around .
F	by the time we got off the bus the replacement was full so we had to get on another bus .
F	i had to follow my order up 0_days_later to ensure it had been sent .
F	excellent service clothes were delivered the next_day with a 0 hour time_slot .
M	the people i spoke to on the phone were pleasant but the process for returning was laborious with little communication between warehouse and customer service which could be simple to fix .
M	my experience is you get what you pay for but with this one you pay over the top for less .
F	the product came as requested without_any damage and responses from customer service were quick when i emailed them , however i was disappointed as i had ordered the product on the 00th_dec as a gift for someone for christmas thinking that was adequate time , the email i received on ordering said it should be dispatched within a week however it wasn_'_t actually dispatched until the 00st_dec to be delivered on the next working day which was the 00th_dec , i '_d already left to visit family for christmas so it arrived too late .
M	part_exchanged my 0 year_old ford_ka which i bought brand_new from this garage , after 000 , 000 trouble_free miles . this time i bought a 0 year_old ka with 0 , 000_miles on the clock .
F	i ordered a calendar , they sent it to me in a box that was over 0 inches too short so they just shoved it in and the cardboard ripped and creased meaning i was unable to give it as a gift as intended .
M	some illegible writing was on the window but no other indication that it was unfit for use .
F	waited in until_0pm yesterday expecting delivery .
F	which i '_d already given them .
F	i have e_mailed them twice and got no response , it states it could take up to two working_days to reply to e_mails ( why ) .
M	great place for wires and spare_parts , but not full blown products .
M	mothers_day missed , and now no flowers at all .
M	har_ikke prøvet noget tilsvarende !
F	excellent selection of sweets at a very competitive price .
M	easy website , quick process of ordering , very quick delivery and good communication , in other words a joy to use .
F	excellent service and gift arrived with perfect wrapping .
F	i needed the jumpers the next_day and selected the express service on a friday around lunchtime .
F	i received a phone_call from talk_talk saying that they wanted to give me a free tv package upgrade as they wanted to make_sure their existing_customers received the same deal as that offered to new customers .
F	great prices and great service .
F	despite ordering them last_week they were delivered on the day but at 0pm !
M	nothing like the portfolio photographs online .
M	highly_recommend them for service and price !
M	at the time of the order you said that the items were in stock and we should receive within 0 - 0 working_days well we still have not received the said items .
F	what can i say ?

F	what i have a problem is the background music , which is modern and at times too loud .
F	they have 0 friends with my name , so she and her family tried a number of times to find out from you who the sender was .

M	not idea for a household with no one home during the day .
M	i was then informed that they had run out of stock and were unlikely to get anymore .
M	i ordered a pair of boots which were " in stock " two_days_later i get an email_saying they are refunding as they are out of stock and my money will be refunded in three_days , so what with the weekend this gives them and interest free loan for a week .
F	when you go on comparison_sites sometimes you can get more money for your phone but then they knock money for stupid little things like scratches you get half what you expected .
M	after_trawling the website for months for a replacement case for the one i had , i finally came_across this site .
M	they are now not answering any emails ( other than automated_reply ), i put a post about poor service on their facebook_page which did get a response but they tell me they will have to transfer me as " its not their department ".
M	despite explaining the problem to the advisor and requesting an_alternative , they informed me that they would not be doing anything to rectify the problem other than cancelling the payment should i wish .
F	my flight time got pushed back by 0_days and i asked for a refund and some compensation towards booking a new flight since they notified me last_minute and flight costs have doubled in price ( i couldn_'_t take the new flight since i had a connecting_flight with the original flight ).

M	first purchase with jules_b and left very impressed .
F	considering i requested to book on the 00 / 00 and didn_'_t get a confirmation of booking until 00 / 00 ( only 0 before stay and within 0_days cancellation period ) i was disappointed we couldn_'_t have come to some arrangement .
F	if they checked the full address beforehand instead of half the postcode , they also would have avoided this unfortunate situation .
M	i '_m already a return customer but will_certainly become a regular .
M	i did give them the benefit of the doubt and returned a week_later to do another shop but i got exactly the same service as before .
F	have since had a full_refund .
M	the biggest beef i '_ve had with them though is with their billing .
F	good selection of named products with excellent prices .
F	i purchased flowers for a lady suffering a mental breakdown as it is her_birthday this weekend and needed something to cheer_her up .
F	contact has to made via their online support which is slow and unresponsive .

F	i will never use your services again , nor will i be recommending you to anyone i know .
M	once i took my bike with me for which i paid twice as much as for my flight , but they treated me like i was some sort of parasite .

F	dfds offers a good enough service and their prices are pretty_much the same as the rest .
F	bit disappointed quite sparse arrangement .
F	she was put on hold .
M	yes i probably did apply too much pressure but i now have a three inch hole .
F	would not buy again .
M	i am happy to recommend this service to anyone .
F	i bought a medium charger this year , thinking it would run 0 sets but it only takes a maximum of 0 , so i had to send the charger back with one set if lights , and use my big charger from last_year for th rest .
F	as much as the experience with ebookers was good .
M	medication ordered , and promptly delivered .
M	i paid extra for the extra think lenses and when they arrived , they were identical to the standard lenses i had in both my other pairs of glasses .
F	the description clearly_stated : ' this brother_dr - 0000 black_cartridge is compatible with the hl - 0000dn and hl - 0000d printers .
F	this is the second time i have sold an old phone online through mazuma and am very impressed with the speed and efficiency of the transaction it was every bit as efficient as the last time i used them .

F	couldn_'_t ask for more .
M	miss samantha .
F	i ordered a gorgeous bunch of flowers including white anemones and sweet william .
M	if you don_'_t mind your kitchen being unusable for three_months , by all means buy from wren .
M	checked out in no time .
F	the item arrived promptly , was well_wrapped , as_described and excellent value for money .
M	i contacted customer_services on the above matters and had to wait for days for a response .
M	will not be up until tue 0nd_april .
M	that also implies that none of the only two staff we saw was qualified to drive other cars .
F	do not shop with this company .
M	i purchased a paid of goal keeper gloves .
M	they suggested i called o0 retention !!!!!!
F	it '_s got a good range of products and that '_s the main_reason for choosing scubastrore , but it could had some more since i had to order some products from other_places .
F	thanks
F	it had no instructions on how to mix or with how much water cold / hot .
M	shame there isn_'_t a zero_star_rating !
M	one simple phone_call was all it took .
M	having seen an installation done by quickslide and visiting their factory , we fell_into the trap and ordered windows and doors for our home from them .
F	on the day , i was sent a nice email_saying they were out for delivery .
F	they look lovely .
F	they wouldn_'_t allow me to collect it and making arrangements for them to leave it with a neighbour was very difficult and they can '_t confirm what time they will deliver , so trying to make_sure you are it home again isn_'_t easy !
F	then glasses_direct kept me informed_throughout the whole_process , emailing me every_step of the way .
F	arrived 0_months later .
F	however , during quite moderate use , the car developed a number of faults : the dashboard light started going off for no apparent_reason , which was worrying as the entire display was digital so you couldn_'_t see what speed you were doing ; the left - signal indicator light went out towards the end of the rental ; the plastic protector in the trunk came loose ; and as a short person i found the car_seat hard to adjust to a reasonable position .
M	delivery arrived well , totaly as expected
M	easy to order and good information on website .
M	faultless .
F	i await their reply .
F	i bought this as a present however due to the opened packaging i kept it and bought them something_else .

M	thanks lfh
F	i was shocked my phone was bought from new so i challenged the rep over the phone and he finally said he would get back to me in 00_hours . hmm u guessed it no call was returned so i called again and this time i was told the delay was solely due to the fault of apple and that i was told the unlock_code will take 00 days so i should be patient okay i said i understood that but i was basically told by a previous advisor that the code was going to be sent on a specific date and was also told that my phone was stolen so got a bit_worried .
F	she , said a few flowers were already fully out - wouldn_'_t last too long .
M	staff very helpful and friendly , nothing is too much_trouble .
F	it was not dispatched so will have to wait to see if going to be refunded .
M	not the best experience .
M	added to that , due to an error i made in my order , the sales_person i spoke to was extremely_helpful and resolved my error and the battery was despatched , arriving on time .
M	before trying to sell something on gumtree i wanted to get a used iphone .
M	i was confused at first , but once you weed through the b . s .

M	we have since found a much_better alternative company that seem to value our custom .
F	everything i order is received promptly and efficiently .
F	went from a memory_foam_mattress to a decent pocket_sprung one and can already feel the difference in my back , i '_m now getting a more supported , comfortable sleep .

F	i asked for a refund .
M	i really like the 00mg menthol .
M	wiggle have a huge_range of stock , up to date information on stock_levels , competitive_prices , fast delivery and secure_packaging .
F	your money is freezin ." on and on .
F	so we could try and source something from elsewhere .
M	had paid an extra £ 0 for next working day delivery and ended picking it up from the post_office myself a week_later .
M	the idea of waiting till midnight is a joke
F	past .
M	the staff_member was polite and helpful , no_complaints there .
F	i have not one thing bad to day about pet_supermarket , what a variety of things they have , i just typed in what i was looking for and there it was and very reasonably_priced to .
M	around 0pm 0 days_later had been opened , handed to me with a grunt by some bloke in a motor with parcels lying all over the back seat , ( some opened ) never had to sign for it good eh i could have been anyone , ?
M	i have never had bad service with them , plus i time i did need to call them on a mistake on my behalf , them man who took my call couldn_'_t have been more welcoming .
F	the tip to add 0 / 0 inch to my measurements was spot_on .
F	and everyone loves it .
M	the several staff in the shop who assisted us were so sorry for the experience that we had had and were extremely_helpful with our need and are a credit to the company .
F	especially like the text service that lets you know when the flowers are on their way and when they have been delivered .
M	looks good , feels good , simple to put on .
M	finally a reply , for items in box bigger than 00x00x00 there is no free returns_policy , for to arrange_collection £_00 to be paid .

F	the bus_tour started off bad as we lost over half an_hour sat waiting on the bus and no one knew why . it turned_out it was because the audio system didn_'_t work and they were waiting for another bus to come .
M	cool new red jum . wait a minute .!!!!
M	affordable products great delivery times
F	when i rang i was told i had to wait 00 working_days , then i received and email from customer_care saying i have to wait_until the 0th_may before they can even track the package .
F	viagogo said they would be despatched nearer the time but didn_'_t specify when .
M	programs are really poor now far to many repeats and programs are repeated far to quickly , some are tarted up to look different total crap
F	i had to pay the sender to send again .
F	i was promised my booking confirmation would be sent out to me by post to my home address over a week_ago and as yet it has not arrived surely the post shouldn_'_t take this long !
F	really good value for money too .
F	once i placed my order the service was excellent .
M	price was affordable , delivery excellent
M	keep_up the good service & i '_ll be back .
M	went on website to compare car_hire in the states , wanted to book before getting there .
F	i emailed fabriah to lt them know and within 00 - 00_hours there was a new order sent out to me and an_email_apologising for the inconvenience .
M	products met my expectations
M	however , we were informed by optical_express that the deposit made is non - refundable and that they only return the money if cancellations are received within_00hrs of booking .
F	), sits on it for a month with no goods to despatch , even if everyone of the 0000 cancels their order , they will have had interest on £ 0000 for a month .
M	csl seem to be ignoring the sale of goods_act , in that the product should be " fit for purpose ".
M	overall a good experience and will_definately buy my my next laptop from pc_specialist .
M	admittedly it was on a saturday - and received only an_automated_response .
M	the sole_reason i am with them is that its not about the company its about the useless people they hire .
M	i sent this message at facebook and they simply erase it
M	very good except for the long wait for a member of staff to arrive when picking_up the car .
M	the functionality of the web_site is good , but the customer service ( and the abilty to add up !)
M	bit of a shame but it '_s written in the equivalent of mandarin chinese .
M	the selection of goods in the shop is also limited .
F	it wasnt quite what i expected , it had two parts rather_than one .
F	secondly the delivery : i '_ve had one delivery where they couldn_'_t find my house so kept trying to deliver it to another house on the wrong street .
F	all in all a very frustrating experience .
F	couldn_'_t take the risk .
M	having become_disillusioned with the over - bureaucratic banking_system i looked at alternative funding sources for my business , and thankfully found funding_circle - intelligent people with understanding offering simple , effective funding options !

M	good store and very competitively_priced , delivery was exactly when stated within a one hour_slot , i found the chat box actually worked !
F	thankyou serenata .
F	also , i was not given the size of car i was promised .
M	ordered on the thursday and delivered on the saturday .
F	would recommend and use the site again .
M	0_stars is being generous !
M	there is still no_indication as to when the goods will be delivered ( and hasn_'_t been all week ), no manager will come to the phone at uk sports_imports to speak to us , and to top it off , the phone has just been put down on us .
M	they don_'_t even let you have any little perks !
M	it looked like a customer or catalogue return or ex - demo to me , plus it did not arrived sealed from the courier so who was to know .
F	order before 0pm and get delivery next_day , rubbish !!!!!
M	can you please confirm the customers full name ?
F	i had been visiting a close friend on the occasion of her 00th_birthday and ordered her a bouquet in the hope that she would receive it whilst i was with her .
F	this would then effect the rest of the day , but i managed to change our next activity to be half an_hour later .
F	had to give one star but would have given them a minus .
M	it was finally delivered on 00 january_0000 .
M	i '_m really pleased with the performance of these little 00 . 0v_drill - drivers .
F	my partners outfit didn_'_t look as good as it had online but we still both came runners up at the fancy_dress_party , would recommend and use again .
F	villa in need of updating , obvious damp on internal doorways , musty smell , there were broken plastic tables abanded in two courners of garden .
M	parts delivered fast .
F	my queries were answered within a day or so .
M	contact was very easy and there was no problem with changing the inventory , although the cancelled items did eventually turn_up !
F	to be honest this was last_minute and asked if there was t - shirt company local and wuggle was recommended to me .
F	surfice to say i will be taking this further
F	i '_ve already asked my credit_card firm to enter a dispute as i '_m strongly suspecting i '_ve been stung .
F	what better service could one ask for .
M	first time i have used rajapack .
F	finally after my call to trading_standards i checked my emails to find an_email from yes you have guessed it .
M	i find that the product is of poor quality and their customer_services are very inefficient compared to other on line companies .
F	i found a really good deal , so good my local tyre place couldn_'_t match it .
F	least a few_pounds more you know you will get what u pay for !
M	from the initial_contact to installation of the equiptment .
M	would ( no , will ) use them again when the need_arises , and will pass on their name to any friends who find themselves in the market for curtains .
F	if you are going to cut_corners and costs gd - do it in the back room not at the customer face - i will not be returning
F	the cheapest price has led to more expense in the long run .
M	prices were good - would rcommend
F	!
M	i '_ve now used feel good contacts three_times and they cannot be_beaten on price and delivery time .
F	absolutely terrible - i will never use you again .
M	tv sat in shed for 0 year ordered parts from flattvparts . co . uk now working again thank_you for great service and reasonable prices .
F	flowers not as_described realise its the busy_period ( xmas ) but was not happy with them at all however customer service i cannot_fault at all and was offered a refund or new flowers straight_away - would not put me off using again just not at busy_periods !
M	it '_s been a month and still no cashflow .
M	quotes like " that '_s the company policy " & " our prices are competitive ", despite clear evidenc to the contrary , they refuse to do anything and refuse to pass you on to anyone_else as ' you would be wasting their time ".
F	after paying £ 0 . 00 for " express delivery ", i assumed i would be receiving the tickets by this friday at the latest .
F	at 0 . 00hrs this morning , my sister found the flowers dumped on the doorstep .
M	if one pays with a credit_card , one can only have the parcel posted to the address of the card ( my home ) and only during office hours .
F	a refund was requested in the absence of the product , but beautybay failed to respond to emails .
M	stan @ stanrolls . co . uk
F	the parcel arrived exactly as per the notification , it was well_packaged , but not over packaged as some products are , and i would definitely use them again .
F	i ordered diet_chef on 0th_august it did not arrive till the 00th . it was supposed to be delivered on the 0th .
F	0_weeks before a holiday .
F	then went on to return part of my order via_royal_mail , which cloggs are denying having received .
F	i only know how to use a computer ( not about what makes it tick ).
M	i usually use a rival string company but decided to try string direct because of the competitive_prices , however i received the wrong set of strings which arrived on time but meant i had to do my session with old strings until the right ones arrived 0 days_later .
F	would definitely recommend to others .
M	following resolution of this problem , the results have been much more predictable .
F	delivery within 00_hours of order , able to monitor progress with email_updates received .
M	as soon as it was reported they dispatched a replacement plus a free whole chicken as an_apology .
F	noticed again later that day that my order still hadn_'_t been processed so called again .
M	would recommend to anyone .
F	check the site regularly for outwell bargains .
F	i was looking for something different for christmas_present and loved the range and prices available on this site .
M	so to rate furniture_market ;
F	unfortunately vp take the view that i should suck it up because i didn_'_t complain immediately .
F	fab item and very stylish !
F	no responding to e_-_mails asking for the parcels arrivel and explanations for delaying things .
M	needed some advice about webber_bbq accessories .
F	also , why ask for a signature on delivery ?
F	with only one posting day left before christmas .
M	on this occasion i decided the style wasn_'_t what i was looking for and i returned the item .
M	i highly_recommend tyre_shopper to anyone who is looking for value for money with a professional service in their tyres .
M	i actually managed to get through to iflorist after 0 attempts on the phone and the lady told me that a mix_up had occurred and that she would upgrade the flowers to a delivery from a local_florist .
M	if it '_s on hold " for my protection " why did they charge the card ?
M	a strait_forward internet company . no_frills easy to select the product you want . very good value and large_selection of goods .
M	not only did they supply the product at a much_lower price - we felt they really understood how important jasper is to our family .
M	unfortunately this only became_apparent after i ' d worn them for a considerable time , meaning i can '_t return them even if i had been sensible enough to keep all the packaging .
F	very disappointed that you can no_longer book through virgin air miles club .
F	i was impressed with the efficiency and service that i recieved .
M	i personally prefer the previous model . i am happy to order etc on line but find the current model a bit convoluted and slows the delivery of service to customers . i have marked it acceptable largely beacause i am a long_standing customer and have good local_branch
M	0 .
F	my parents don_'_t have a garage !
M	march 00st 0000 : order placed and payment taken for £_00 . 00 - two day delivery selected .
F	:-( missed out on that one !
F	a rather lengthy story , but i think it warrants telling .
F	i was guaranteed a cleaner today , 00th_april at 00 : 00 .
F	well donre lensstore !!
F	i was kept_informed at all_stages , when the order went through , when they were sent out and when they were delivered .
M	great service and superb price .
M	j . s . sproul
F	however a piece was missing sent email to customer_services who failed to respond to emails .
M	may take the opportunity to thank_you , for your kind and generous reminder , to my review .
F	i recently_sold an iphone_0gs to fonebank which was in perfect_condition .
F	i cannot_afford to wait in for another whole day for the same thing to happen .
F	since i found british_corner_shop my life in italy is even better .
F	talk_talk could not rectify had to cancel and re - order , so lots of messing_about , not a good start .
F	i asked to speak to a supervisor who called me back and reiterated that i would have to pay the cancellation_fee and waste time at the post_office despite the website misrepresenting what i was buying .
F	thank_you i will certainly recommend to friends .
M	this is just an unneccessary irritation to genuine customers . real scammers will try to change the delivery address retrospectively by telephone .
F	got these half price so maybe inferior quality flowers used !
M	think also of the massive space - saving ( and cost - saving weight - wise ) exercise it would be for the couriers plus your own storage requirements .
M	jonathan
F	thanks !
M	what i found afterwards was they shook them out in the rooms we had crap everywhere .
F	was fast no_fuss and completed within days easy would definately use again
F	the flowers came on time , i expected more of a fuller bunch but you can '_t expect much at such low_prices
M	no item received no email_saying when it could be delivered .
M	i contacted customer service and they immediately arranged return and replacement , really quickly and without_any question .
F	where do i begin ?
F	customer service is excellent .
F	however , i appreciated zoe sorting me out , and calling me back to close the feedback & service loop .
F	purchased a hoodie online as a special present .
M	i had planned a trip to the farnborough airshow this year ( 0000 ), and wanted to explore a bit more with my camera , beyond what my standard zoom could do , so i did some looking online at places which would hire out some of the more " meaty " lenses .
M	the phone i ordered got here really quickly and they kept me updated with brief emails which didn_'_t try to sell me a million other things .
M	yes - they did the job !
M	they basically on the phone said they had " tried and failed to appease me and resolve the issue ".
M	a fantastic service as always from edge and wax .
M	almost unwatchable .
F	when i ordered my skis , they indicated they were in stock and would be shipped in 0_days .
M	asos head_office
M	placed 0 orders recently .
M	went to collect tickets next_day from royal_mail who stated i had to wait 00_hours before collection .
F	optical_express is more_expensive but the care and aftercare is amazing .
M	easy to use site , top communication all the way through .
F	i haven_'_t taken the item out of the packaging to see if the costume itself is in order as i was still hoping to return the item but with no further contact from mfd i am not prepared to make another journey to argos only for them to tell me again to go back to the supplier .
F	luckily after having the house upside_down my husband found two different keys and gave_me number he thought was the correct one to order some spares .
F	the villa was superb .
F	it was obviously from frozen and had been deep fried badly as was soggy , not nice at all and most was left .
F	the delivery man was actually seen leaving after just putting a card through the door without_knocking - i mean , why_bother walking to the door without_knocking !
M	quality products with fast and efficient service .
F	the furniture , two deliveries , that we received was just as we wanted and in very good condition , unfortunately we had two holes missing to support internal shelves but this was soon corrected and did not spoil our enjoyment of the product .
M	good job guys !
M	it turns_out that dollar are offering a euro promo at the moment ( don_'_t know if only via rentalcars ), i am from uk , people we were meeting from us could not get this deal .
M	what an appalling service and even worse attitude to customer service .
F	the tuxedo fits_perfectly and exceptional quality .
F	the photos have now been printed so i have requested that these be sent to me as well as receiving a refund .
F	avoid at all costs .
F	how can your system alter the dates i put in .
M	i had one salesman continuously try to sell me additional sim_card which would save me some money - but i had to repeat that i did not want this and wanted the mobile_broadband only .
M	then they changed it to £_00 .
F	i placed my order and got one of the lens prescriptions wrong .
F	in my experience quidco are quicker and less ` fussy `
F	so , am struggling with the other meal .
M	good value for this high_spec siemens induction_hob , but unfortunately one of the rings wasn_'_t working .
F	but i have not received 0 items on my shopping list .
M	i '_ll be ordering elsewhere next time that '_s for sure .
F	i then decided to go for some designer_glasses when they sent me an_email offering 00_%_off glasses over_£_00 .
F	would recommend petmeds - have used them for years for a reliable online prescription service which is cheaper_than obtaining medication from the vet even considering the prescription cost that vets now charge
M	?
M	great delivery , price and advice .
F	slot is 0 am - 0 pm .
M	!
M	i would say i will be again from the sungalles shop but i have done already - 0 times .
M	staff were kind , flexible and professional throughout .
F	i had to wait to the following work day , call your office and have it processed over the phone .
F	after a quick conversation with gur i had explained my needs , and my confusion and was steered back on track .
F	i purchased flea_treatment on behalf of a few friends who do not have the internet and was accused of selling it on .
M	size_chart is very wrong .
M	i was pleasantly_surprised at the speed and relatively reasonable cost of shipping , as i live in northern_ireland .
M	i '_ve ordered several_times from guitar_fx direct and been really pleased with their service every time .
F	good communication , but should not offer goods which they do not have in stock .
M	!
M	come on paddock_spares , pull your finger out !
F	i purchased a pair of adidas golf_shoes , had them on about 0 times , due to our lovely weather , had the chance to go back out and play the game i love to find out that the right shoe was letting in water , phoned littlewoods explained the situation , they were so nice on the phone , told me to return them and they would credit my account with the £_000 that they cost .
F	not really trusting her less_than enthusiastic assistance , i asked for confirmation in writing !
F	!
M	item arrived after 0 days but was faulty .
F	it took three tries for them to send the correct order , each time with long delays .
M	i should have read the other reviews on here because clearly studio is not the place to buy a sofa - they seem unable to deliver (_pardon the pun ).
F	offered me an ' upgrade ' for free for the next_day .
F	this was a complete let_down for me as i had ordered a bouquet the week before for my friend and they were beautiful .
M	this review is from a confirmed client !
M	delivery was quick and customer_services were very helpful .
F	consigned to the garage .
M	i had to return an item due to me ordering the wrong_size , but it was hassle_free and money refunded promptly .
F	the only fault is that i made a mistake with the delivery date ( birthday so i needed the flowers there on the correct date ) and serenata said i '_d left it too late , even_though it was hours before .
M	would happily have waited for both to be delivered together ; one is not much good without the other !
M	great service as i was kept_informed by email where my glasses were in the production process .
F	placed order 00th_march_0000 , for nursery 0 piece furniture set .
M	on £_000 worth of clamps i would expect more than bits of cardboard on the heads and nothing but cling - wrap on the bars .
M	i certainly won_'_t use them again .
F	anyway , thanks for giving me the opportunity to get this gripe off my chest !
M	the unit is small and light , good for quick cleans .
M	00 out of 00 . thank_you .
M	the service on arrival was quick but on return there was no thank_you from the assistant who had a grumpy face .
M	easy to place order , even from overseas .
M	ordering is simple enough with ratings next to each product and all categorised too , ordering is fast , safe and simple .
M	chap said he would have to look into it and would ring back .
M	my only issue is the fact i paid for special delivery so insure it got there without the sticky fingers of the royal_mail interfering .
M	quite astonishing differences .
M	thank_you !
F	i explained that clearly it wasn_'_t for me as my delivery note clearly_stated 00 packs of flooring and 0 packs of underlay but he wouldn_'_t take the wooden sheet with him .
F	so well_done tesco for shooting yourselfs in the foot .
M	so .
F	quality good and well_packaged .
F	i returned a pair of shoes 0_weeks_ago and still_havent received a refund .
F	i had no more time to take the matter up with rentalcars . com as i was on my way to attend a funeral and had to leave the airport and take a taxi .
F	i would expect to see the repeat_prescription item name and cost etc in there , but its blank and always says £ 0 ?
M	i didn_'_t receive my free_samples either
M	you can trust them .
F	delivery aside i would recommend to a friend .
F	someone told me to get a prescription from the vet and go to viovet . co . uk to dispense the meds .
F	absolutely appalled at service , will need to take more take off work ( once for delivery and once for engineer ’_s visit ).
F	i then ordered it and quickly received it through the post - i cannot_fault their service .
F	one the strength of one short phone_call i can '_t say much - the guy was pleasant and polite .
M	i '_ve already exhausted myself adding comments to the other reviews .
F	i will take this further with local media , i want my money back and an_apology .
M	recommended
F	i would recommend pinesolutions .
M	i am more than happy with the quality of the product supplied and will be ordering from body_building warehouse again soon .
M	so as i said delivery lousy !
F	to see if they could take the booking instead and would get someone to phone me back .
M	so here is my review you go stick your crap company right where it should be !!
M	i also suggested that they stock bigger ( 000cc ) bottles of lower strength juices but was politely told the lowest strength of any flavour in this size was 00mg .
F	sl0 0tu house no : 00
M	competition is tough so they should be making_sure that their customers are kept up to date about their order .
F	everything would be fine if it wasn_'_t for the fact that we only got the text at 0 . 00_pm !!!
M	vervolgens ging ik '_s morgens om 00 : 00 uur de aanbetaling regelen via ideal , om 00 : 00 uur was de aanbetaling die ik had gedaan nog niet zichtbaar in ' mijn boeking '.
F	i placed an order and received confirmation followed_by prompt delivery but only of partial order .
F	clear_concise and user_friendly system to book and collect .
F	so now they have taken my money and i have to try and get it back , it will take 0_days for a refund to process and that money is what i needed to buy my flights with .
F	quick service , happy to help with any_queries to obtain right product for your pet .
M	by 00 july we had received no word so my wife phoned customer_services .
M	i was told that new stock would be in by the end of the week .
F	as a person very experienced in all matters ' diy ' i found assembling the metal garage very very time_consuming and the instructions not as helpful as they could be !
M	i realy had high regards for 000 - reg and recomended all my clients to them .
M	earlier today i bought a mondeo yp00jnx from doncaster stoneacre , with lifetime_guarantee available .
F	this company and their service was excellent .
M	i have also complained 0 times in total 0 phone escalations and 0 e_- mail witch was also reports a breach of data_protection , this was more than 0_weeks_ago and still no response lol .
M	at 00 . 00 i received an email_telling_me that the driver had been unable to find anyone at the address given and was “ unable ” to make delivery .
F	realised when i got home we '_d ordered the wrong ones .
F	clients shouldn_'_t be chasing for information and work .
F	the ink either from the printer or on the design itself seemed to have run slightly so the invitations had very noticeable marks on them .
M	easy to pay via_paypal .
M	maybe time to use a better delivery service ?
F	i wish that i had found animed earlier - easy to use , reasonable and efficient .
F	hi .
M	i have used them for several purchases and found that their products are of high_quality and very affordable prices .
M	easy to find , no problem finding a parking_space , peace of mind my car being in a secure place and also hardly no time to wait for a bus to take us to the airport and a friendly helpful bus driver to pick us up and take us back to the carpark .
F	i thought great . just in time .
M	ordering is simple and the items are delivered within just a couple of days and very well_packaged in bubble_wrap .
F	i also had a confirmation for chocolates i had not ordered !
F	great service - quick , reasonably_priced and a seal that works !
F	however the packaging used had flattened the paper cupcake_cases somewhat .
F	this was one of the few websites that i was able to get the colour of oakleys that i required as a gift for my husband .
F	not always top of search_engine results but consistently very good rates .
M	fantastic , just the reassurance i needed .
F	i would never recommend and will never use them again !
F	very dissappointed !
F	if the original operative had shown me the same consideration my comment above would have been excellent .
M	one of the only online_retailers to have the product i was searching for , natureshop provided a great service including a free prepaid_label in case i needed to return the item .
M	very good internet site , all articles with clear photos the price is good comparing to other_companies and they keep you very well informed about the dispatch from your order .
M	just won_'_t shop with them again !
M	not physically seeing the watch i was a little_apprehensive_about ordering it on line , but upon_receipt i was absolutely_delighted with my choice .
F	rubbish !!!
F	sort it out serenata !
M	instead of refunding , they sent me a ‘ pre_- paid label ’ early may .
F	i have sent 0 further messages with no contact and am so worried that the hotel rooms and 0x train_tickets are going to be a waste of money , on top of the extortionate price of the tickets already purchased .
F	then a final letter in my returned glasses anonymously thanking_me for ordering my new_specs and hoping i would be pleased with them and assuring_me of their 000_% commitment to customer service .
M	yes , she syas and does it .
M	a convenient location which is easy to find .
F	so on the 0th do december requested my iphone 0 to be unlocked so i could use my
M	from_start to finish took about 0 mins all very easy .
M	they also have a 0 - day returns_policy , but the product info is pretty accurate and sizing_charts help with sizing ( funny that !)
F	ordered the wrong_size did not realize til delivered .
M	didnt think the sumac had much taste , but thats no fault of the seller .
F	fast and efficient .
M	so i had to refuse the order when it turned_up and then wait for it to be returned back to them so i can get a refund . still_waiting . do not use these !!!
M	now given up expecting any reply and have switched to another supplier - life '_s too short !
M	whilst waiting to board the flight i gave sky_park a courtesy_call to let them know i wouldn ’_t be needed their services .
M	good website , selection and prices , but appalling delivery service .
F	~ avoid it !
F	trading_standards are aware of this company and investigating the laws they are breaking also looking into them charging customers surcharges for paying with paypal .
F	which is a bonus for most people ( unlike tesco !)
M	had oil and vinegar drizzlers bought me as a gift .
M	as it is the first time i have utilised the company , i would certainly use them again and recommend them .
F	there was no_pressure put upon me to sign up to anything ; the decision was left entirely to me to make .
F	very good service , price and product .
F	i would really recommend alpha as it was easy to understand and i quickly found the policy that was right for me , i was able to relax during my holiday and i would definitely use alpha for my next trip
F	after a little searchin online i discovered the perfect table and nest of tables with oakfurnitureland , i was delighted with the price as they were on sale .
F	there web_site is very easy to use , excellent choice of runners and great that you can order a sample if you wish .
F	it came on time , and customer service was helpful when i had a query about its contents .
F	they don_'_t apologise , cannot guarantee to deliver or call you - a delivery company who cannot guarantee deliveries .
M	trading_standards contacted .
M	advice to new buyers : don_'_t touch them with a barge_pole .
F	mais la prestation en a été autrement .
F	yes - you do get some good deals on this site but don_'_t bother if you are in a hurry !
M	this was not disclosed ' in the interests of security '.
F	i promptly made my way home , from work , and arrived home well within the timescale to find the delivery van waiting outside .
M	my only issue is that one of my items was listed as expired which means they claim they did not receive the item .
M	there service and website were otherwise fine and delivery was prompt .
F	richard harrisonfrom key_retirement_solutions was very helpful when i asked for impartial_advice on equity_release .
F	i emailed back saying that doesn_'_t suit me and today is my only available day so they should come .
M	they have been very slow in responding to my email contact and are being less_than helpful in assisting me .
M	just sent the initial story of to watchdog on their website ( what a bind ).
M	hope the person it was originally_intended for has got it by now .
F	great products , but the item was delivered the day after i was told it would be , which may be to do with the courier , not me kind .
M	00 of the boxes arrived next_day and the other 0 a day latter .
F	third time spoke to someone_who couldn_'_t really care , said it was the carrier '_s fault not theirs , and said she would process a refund for goods but nothing for telephone_calls unless i sent a statement .
F	!
F	however , recently there was a mistake in my completed image and i dismissed it and stated the reason .
F	the flowers were just about acceptable although two stems were snapped , and the 0 roses only lasted two_days .
M	just a shame that there is 0 long scratch right across the front .
M	the response was unhelpful , rude and obstructive .
M	still was saying " out for delivery " kept refreshing it ontil at 0000 it changed to say that they were unable to deliver as nobody was in !
F	everything about ilumi is fantastic easy to order and arrived quickly .
F	they do offer good value products in most_cases but i feel they punish their suppliers to enable this .
F	thanks
M	wsate of space , i have spent_thousands with dabs over the years , went over to amazon because of a minor_issue years_ago because amazon customer_support is great , made a mistake and bought a new htc m0 from dams , showed as in stock for next_day delivery , still_waiting 0 days_later , tried to cancel order before despatched as i am supposed to be able to , 00_hours before despatch could not cancel order .
F	i said we were having great difficulty_getting my very ill son - in - law out of the house for hospital visits but would manage for one more week .
M	i have never requested anything from badoo , and now two of my email accounts are filling up with unsolicited junk from them .
F	i was quite shocked as the tables looked to be poor quality and definitely couldn_'_t use them so i contacted customer_services to see what i could do .
F	i was fed_up with paying £ 0 for an eco light_bulb in a supermarket where there was very little choice so this was really useful .
M	explain to my customer why it cost so much to install
F	i even gave a contact phone number should there be a problem delivering them , so really there is no excuse .
M	easy to navigate website , prices competitive , fast delivery service
M	im never buying witg theses again and i would advice no ond to shop with them .
F	our ideas are always taken on board , which steven then adds his own obvious design expertise to , turning them into something we are always 000_% happy with and a finished_product that truly represents our brand .
M	i '_m always on a tight_schedule with my work and i have never found a garage that understands this , even on that one and only service i didn_'_t get the car back at the alloted_time because they didn_'_t have an oil_filter for it in stock !!!!!
M	a great price for a great product would buy from them again
M	the blinds are also very easy to fit .
M	they didn_'_t have the ski '_s i was after but were able to get them in really quickly - and the boot fitting service was super .
F	very pleased with the product and the prompt service .
M	our shipment arrived in good time too .
M	about too unsubscribe as to many emails received
M	waited all day for delivery .
F	this site is disgraceful , i got no help and should have been offered some kind of refund or at_least my £_00 postage returned back to me . at the very least !
F	highly_recommend this website .
M	the price for the lens i got was also the cheapest i could_find so overall i couldn_'_t have been any happier with how the whole_process went .
M	customer service was poor and there is misleading information on the website .
M	i ordered my tyres tuesday 00 april , and was amazed to see they could be fitted on thursday_morning 0nd may .
M	but after 0 months it finally gets sorted_out .
F	i also asked a question using online_chat which was quickly answered .
F	have always been a 0 in tennis_shoes but the babolat one '_s ordered were too small .
M	bought a 00watt led tube to replace the standard 00watt kitchen tube .
M	what other solvent product would be compatable with por00 ?
M	trading_standards must get involved .
F	full of glitches , hard to navigate and their stock_levels are unreliable with some items selling out quickly and not replenished .
F	would definitely purchase from you again .
M	they are now ignoring my emails and i cant get an answer so it looks_like i will have to resort to going legal .
M	you are there to help .
M	i arranged a pick_up date and gave the instructions to pick it up from the back garden , as i wasn_'_t going to take a day off work , given a day of my time is more_expensive than the item they damaged .
M	then a few_months later i broke one of the lenses .
M	i started buying my lenses from feelgood over a year now after my last provider let_me down when they took my order and notified me days_later that my lenses were out of stock .
F	telephoned and i had an answer with the tele no they suggest to ring .
F	i have used viovet on three or four occasions over the last_year and will happily continue to do so .
M	the price changed and came to the amount agent mentioned on the phone .
F	tried to find out what time my parcel might arrive since it had been loaded_onto van at 00 . 00 this morning .
M	hob was extremely well_wrapped ( i '_ve never seen so much bubble_wrap !)
M	it was spot on will buy from again
M	fowers did not in the slightest look like the picture and are very disappointing .
M	!
M	once again i was told that the delay was due to the xmas_rush but that the delivery would definitely be made that day .
M	if you have a so - so prescription or lower_than go for it , if your eye_sight is relatively bad than give it a miss .
M	awesome first experience and will_definitely use again .
F	why did it leave the warehouse in that condition ?
F	=.
M	customer service is dyer - " its the time of year " and " the courier has to deliver them " - er well try the correct house and maybe that would happen .
M	at that point in time , with no information from the company and no credit in the account , i submitted a fair , factual appraisal of the experience i had .
M	!
F	it is a joy to see children ( and their parents ) play with toys and games that please them .
M	however , i paid close to £_00 for next_day delivery ( having ordered them at 0 in the morning ) and they took 0 days to arrive .
F	they arrived on saturday and were the completely wrong order .
M	all in all the roses were nice but the delivery time not good !!!
F	now 0_days away from my trip i called your customer service desk who advised that the deliverly of the product i ordered would not actually be in until the following week .
M	mr hall gave_us very good service
F	absolutely recommend usb0u .
M	ordered a bosch_sds_drill for a difficult job drilling_holes in concrete fence posts which my previous hammer_drill waved the white flag at !.
M	if they have such a poor customer service record why do any companies use them ?????
M	which can make in - store browsing a bit tiresome ( have you considered an lg sir ?).
F	i sent a iphone 0 00gb off and was offered £_000 .
M	i now prey they go_bankrupt
F	great item - great price .
M	chair cushion filling nowhere_near as resilient as the settee cushion fillings .
F	to add_insult to injury , both my husband and i were at home and there is no_doubt at_least one of us would have heard the bell , if the driver had bothered to ring it .

F	communications on the phone were equally reassuring , and the piano arrived within a week , on the arranged day .

F	in the afternoon of the same day i had a phone_call to say it was ' difficult to find anyone who could deliver them that day '.
F	0_days_later i managed to speak to someone via the online_chat who told me my order was still being_processed and would be another 0_days !!
F	my product arrived two_days_later .
M	on looking around ebookers was about the same price as its main competitors but where i saved was in booking car_hire at the same time as this saved £_00_-£_00 pounds straight_away .
F	but postage was good timescale hence score .
F	would like to have had more choice in 0x0 only about 0 / 0 there .
M	ordered some roses for valentines_day and although the delivery and overall service was good the actual flowers looked a bit worn and tired which was bit_disappointing .

M	a donkey and a pickpocket with adhd would be a more reliable courier
F	the tube shakers was good but after a few uses the end broke .
F	!
M	and not one tile broke .
M	as the phone had been working_perfectly for almost three_months with a broken screen , i can only_assume the ' fault ' was either due to a poor repair or an excuse because they ' d_forgotten to actually fix the phone .
F	so as a matter of principle i weighed out the correct amount and found the right sized spoons in my own collection !
M	we bought a brand_new nissan_note tekna from chorley_nissan blackpool on the 0nd june .

M	from my first e_- mail inquiry to the final delivery of the goods the service was very fast throughout and the personal_touch was evident at every point .
F	we were kept_fully_informed of our delivery , which arrived exactly on time .
M	i just bought the speg winter_gloves .
M	so you can try by the products elsewhere thinking it '_s in stock , get charged , then the same thing , they finally tell you they own the companies too
F	so begrudgingly i starting arranging to move the services over to my new home only to find that i would be renewing the 00 month minimum contract something i did not want to do .
M	i still have not recieved my star pack after a week and no reply to any of my emails

M	very happy +++++++++++++++
M	well , it took about 0 or 0 months for me to get it sorted and for me to get in touch with a nice lady in disconnections who understood my frustration and who not only fixed my bill but also ensured i '_m receiving a £ 0 loyalty_discount for the next 00 months .
M	i asked to speak to a supervisor but was told they were busy and would call me back , they did not do this .
F	i feel a bit_cheated that i '_ve had to resort to writing on a forum to express my comments but it seems the only way to get it seen by someone with a bit of power about the situation .
M	after arranging a pick_up twice with no attempt made to collect , or contact me about it , i took the laptop in to the local_store .
F	great choices to choose from as a very mixed age_group and also personalities .
M	and finally delivery was just fast just as promised .
F	arrived in under 00_hours .
M	the windows are excellent , however , the whole_process was arduous and frustrating .
F	this stuff seems incredible .
M	i took a chance on buying a £_00 remote from easygate when i fond out that my existing controller is a ' master ' and should be able to programme a ' slave ' of the right kind .
F	well if you had told me that on the phone i may have ordered it !!
M	received coffee_machine and after a telephone_call with delonghi i was advised to return the item as it was obviously faulty .
M	unfortunately it did not fit me so i sent it back and the next_day i had my money refunded .
F	i have been using aol for many many_years but will never use them again and will advise others not to .
M	so massively out of pocket for a day not worked and £ 0 worth of 0000 call charges later , i have no idea what is happening or where my parcel is .
F	had exactly_what i wanted , website easy to use and superquick turnaround to get what i needed .
M	i would recommend tyres on the drive to anyone , first_class service , the whole_process could not have been simpler .
F	found just what i wanted and no postage to pay either for delivery or returns .
F	i was having to purchase the part because my fridge_/_freezer was delivered without an adjustable leg .
F	i will not be purchasing from them again .
F	probably would have had the same at half the price if i '_d ordered the moonlight bouquet .
F	information on web_site was helpful and ordering process straight_forward .
F	they told me i '_d have to submit a complaint and request transcripts of my previous calls to be considered for a refund .
F	and told me the driver had been to my village implying i '_m the one who is lying .
M	!
F	my gran loved them .
F	i definitely recommend optimalprint .
F	i was there when the flowers arrived and whilst a nice bunch they didn_'_t particularly look like they had been super - sized .
F	on - line design service was really useful .
F	this means i won_'_t be ordering items form here often .
F	!
F	i explained my internet was not working and i was therefore unable to send an_email but was told that was the procedure and there was nothing else she could do .
F	as i really liked them and didn_'_t want the hassle of sending them back , i tried the old trick of rubbing the teeth of the zip with a candle which seems to have worked ( for now , anyway !).
F	their extra time for coming_back to re - do the wrong doors / architrave / handles etc all cost us extra money .
F	i understand reluctance on part of seller but if they will sell it , advice should be forthcoming .
M	the senior technician arrived on the day stated and rectified approximately_half of the 00 + issues leaving us now waiting for the french_polisher to be appointed to maybe finish the job fully .
M	the phone was worth £_000 , i got £_00 .
F	they didn_'_t bother to contact me even_though they had my contact information .
F	ruth
M	i could go on but what is the point
F	on their website it does not state that this will be the case if you have to return any product on the contriary it states the opposite as it says " dont worry , if you have a faulty item we will arrange to either replace or refund , standard 00 days no_quibble returns_policy ".
M	not happy
F	i feel the company could provide more information on the location where you are going and what events are on .
M	will use them again and would recommend them to my family and friends sean mcphillips
M	even worse than scottish_power as a utility company & that takes some doing .
M	a bigger surprise was yet to come .
F	sent bouquet to cheer_up sick_relative which it certainly did .
F	every_step was easy and we got next_day pickup .
F	the variety online is ever growing and you can select a specific delivery date .
M	i like using juno because they stock so much and their postal service is always swift and packaging good .
F	in addition , with each order i received a pack of scissors and enough thread to last the rest of my life !
F	no_problems can '_t_believe_how fast i got my cheque very impressed will use again
M	they have good selection of product but you can get better prices ( free delivery ) elsewhere .
F	the paper and cover used are very good quality and this makes the items look professional .
M	not a great experience especially when i have little spare time to be chasing up banking errors and also not recieving the item i actually ordered .
F	very quick turn_around .
F	pay attention and you can get real bargins
F	to cut an extremely long_story_short , i sent them literally dozens of emails - they kept apologising and assuring_me i would be refunded , but i never was .
F	when they arrived they tried the fridge in 0 different places for me .
F	i explained that there was always someone here so he said i '_d need to sort it out with the delivery company . he said ring the no .
M	to cut the story_short , took workshop express advice on shape / size and agreed 0mm overhang .
F	try and keep tabs on the hotel your going to and keep looking at the reviews every week and if your not sure on anything you can always ask the person_who , s review your reading .
F	the pot with some wadding in was bone dry and it seemed as though the flowers had been in the box for some time .
M	i could not use it as i rely_on stock control and i had no faith that i would get any business from it at this point , so why waste effort making a shop .
M	i contacted customer_support 0 days ago .
F	they are one of the fastest suppliers i know , you only wait a few_days compared to some stockest where i have waited over three_weeks .
F	the scheme was ' cashback by redemption ' meaning that we had to mail in our statements and a voucher every few_months ( with increasing regularity ) through the 0 year term of the contract .
M	i '_ve seen plenty of cases where someone has tried to correct an english exercise but the correction was riddled with errors .
M	once my receipient had received the flowers , however , she wondered_if she was qualified to look after them since they came with instructions to talk to them :)
F	i then ordered the tyres online ( which was incredibly easy - and cheaper ).
M	engraving a nice_touch .
M	was phoned at 00 : 00 , rescheduled for 00 : 00 .
M	hong_kong site masquerading as legitimate british site , or at_least one that ships from within the eu .
F	very deceptive .
F	when i contacted customer_services they called me by the wrong name and didn_'_t seem too fussed about the problem .
F	there was no news about possible deliveries before tuesday april 00nd .
M	i did as father asked and e_- maild his details to the company so that they could marry them to his cheque . have they responded ?
F	0_days on and i have no desire to buy a packet of cigarettes !
F	i found them so hard to use because they were quite a small frame , they made me feel very dizzy and sick because of the difference that i could see from the outsides of the frames .
M	i was absolutely seething :-(
F	this company has a total disregard for any packages that have been placed under their care especially the ones clearly_marked with fragile and do not bend .
M	but when i went to pick it up the following_day i was told it was being re - delivered !
F	wouldn_'_t_hesitate to use again .
F	in the meantime countless_emails , messages left and not replied to , delivery dates given but not adhered to , on one historic date pre and after sales sent 0 conflicting delivery dates - of course it did not arrive on either date .
F	i was directed to the online websit who only had it in white which i thought may be okay so purchsed but upon_arrival , found it wasn_'_t .
F	easy to use but the red is overused and not very calming on the eyes .
M	i then had to phone the store the next_day to see if it had arrived which it had .
M	this was not possible and i could not even exchange it for something else because i was outside of your policy dates .
F	i can '_t complain_about the service as i received an answer to my question within 00_minutes prior to ordering the flowers .
F	the bag i ordered was well described and a better price than the other website i found it on but i decided to return it as it was larger than i expected and a little too cumbersome for everyday use .
F	on further inspection , it also had a mark on the plinth .
M	extremely_helpful company to deal with . understanding ones needs and solutions is a great asset .
F	etc .
M	legit website , superb prices , awesome job !
M	we have used alpha_rooms for years and always an exellent service all the way , the people they used in turkey this year not good the atitude of the english female rep at dalaman_airport was at best terrible the bus went without us and all the rep said was you only paid peanuts so i dont_know whay your problem is if you have to wait in heat with no shelter or water for a couple of hrs tough we are quite capable people but what if that was someone old / infirm or with disabled children not what i expect from alpharooms
M	my story is as follows :-
M	i just saved literally £_000 booking a 0_seater .

F	the difference_between rentalcars price and budget '_s price ( hiring direct ) was £_00 .

F	cartridges ok but took over a week to be delivered !

M	excellentvinyl excellent service , excellent postage and quick delivery .
M	ordered a guitar at 0pm on the thursday , realised it wasn_'_t the exact one i wanted ( my mistake , the details on the website were fine but i was doing it quickly before i rushed out the door ) and sent an email almost_immediately to cancel the order .
F	simple to order quick to receive .
F	ordered online , no delivery a week_later .
M	for most stuff ebay and amazon are cheapest , but ebay work with paypal that can cause problems when selling .
M	i had purchased a air_hockey table online and they phoned me back telling_me that they did not have any instock and a refund would take 0 working_days , i explained that i could not wait that long as i need the money to buy a replacement , the sales_person showed no interest , i asked to speak to the director / manager who apparently was not availible but the sales_person would get them to call me to sort_out a same day transfer , this has not happened and the refund is still not processed .
F	many_thanks
M	phoned millets sports who said they were again out of stock and i would have to wait another 0_weeks , so 0_weeks total .
M	in the end we payed and left , then straight_away things went_downhill .
M	apparently , according to the owner , it takes too much time and money to change an order , so it was either keep it or get banned again .
M	would use again
F	i found them very friendly , i could have bought a lot but they made me bought what i needed which i found very gratful -- i will recomend them to all my friends .
F	absolutely fuming . needless to say i am now going through all the paperwork and will be making a complaint to trading_standards or the motor ombudsman ( if there is one !!)
F	i was expecting delivery to be nearer 0_days as i only paid for std delivery but my parcel was here within 0_days .

M	a really good experience in buying the watch at a good saving but when it came to ask for a receipt for insurance_purposes then absolutely no response to e_- mails or phone_calls & after 00 months i give up asking !
M	for clothing , mm accepts only a limited number of labels and the item descriptions on the website are not always how you would describe an item .
F	i went one way and my husband went the other each of us thinking we were going in the right_direction it was very dark and neither of us knew where we were supposed to be heading !!!!
M	however recently i have been less_than impressed .
F	i kept getting different automated emails , which said that they had not received my telephone , that the offer would be withdrawn , and with a lower offer price because they said my phone had not arrived on time .
M	i '_m currently a three customer , not out of choice but because you make it so hard for me to cancel , however my contract is up in 0 months and let_me tell you , ill celebrate that date when it arrives and then take my custom and hard_earned_money somewhere_else , to a provider that actually values me !
M	i am settling via visa claimback .

F	exactly_what i was looking for .
F	the wardrobe is lovely , undamaged and excellent quality of build .
M	the boots arrived promptly - the tracking service is very effective - but , very oddly , the boots were spattered by white mould and covered in what looked like watermarks .
M	the service is quick and professional , great prices too .
M	regards
F	they dont answer phone_calls or emails and on the rare_occasion they do respond they lead you to believe that you still have a booking .
M	now they said they wont send it back because i am not the owner !
M	david : 00 : 00 : 00 this is the first item i sent with yodel , and what a total_failure it has_been , the live_chat on friday confirmed it would be , i cant_remember the name but it was a man

M	the former are terrible , the latter are incompetent and rude in the extreme .
M	ijust want my purchase , not chit chat , i can get that in the high_street , hence i prefer online purchases
M	i '_m afraid i feel the first_tutors site is more towards the latter .
F	ive heard_nothing and its 00 : 00 .
F	massive shame !
F	i search around , decide which policy i want and then click the link on topcashback .

F	brilliant service ; website easy to use , goods arrived very quickly and were easy to fit with supplied instructions .
F	unfortunately , the answer i got was the time_slot given was 0am to 0pm , which means that i have to wait in all day .

F	great product when they finally arrived after delay and constant_chasing from me on a delivery date !
F	very good would highly_recommend .
F	thanks !
M	a fully reliable and trustworthy company with awide range of stock for all vws and very clued_up staff who know what they are talking_about many_thanks will_deffo_use again !!!
F	my protein came really quickly and was wrapped well so didn_'_t have to worry_about royal_mail handling it !
M	!
F	my dog didn_'_t bark and there wasn_'_t a knock .
M	during this time i had to make a lot of phone_calls to spain , i '_m from romania , in order to understand what was the status of my order , i would like to add that i was not informed about any_problems before i made the calls .
M	i was really happy to come_across white &_bishop '_s ' e_- outdoor ' website with the very item i ' d been looking for at ' proper money ' with free delivery , result !
M	i also bought a tinkerspell outfit and one of the straps broke before i ' d even left the house .
M	the cabinet i ordered was to store a large_quantity of music c . ds .
F	the ordering was painless and easy but the service i received was appalling !
F	the girl on the phone made it sound like i was ridiculous expecting the delivery company to deliver to my flat , i think its ridiculous that they expect me to pay £_00 delivery to have the items dumped on the pavement outside my flat !
M	000 billigere , og abonnementet er væsentlig bedre til_mit behov !
M	cheap , prompt , and easy to buy from - not much else you want from a shop really .
M	it was then delivered within 0 days , with an_apology to say there had been an administrative_error .
F	arrived quickly , well_packed and choc medals were perfect for what i wanted .
F	will go to amazon or ebay for future_purchases .
F	so i ordered an extra large top , which was meant to be a size 00 , turns_out to be a size 00 !
F	we end up speanding an extra £_000 between flights to london to be able to fly form their airline , hotel in london because their flight is super early , foods , seats , transport from and to hotel - airport both locations , i can continue .
F	it would be easier to ask for the make and model straight_away .
F	the recipients were in all day and checked their door_bell was working - although i said to leave on doorstep in the instructions , this was in case there was no reply , and only if no response was made - not ringing the doorbell was not the idea !
F	however , it is only open now on a tuesday and it is almost_impossible to get a check up appointment .
M	i '_m very impressed with it - can '_t wait to get below the waves .
M	had to wait 00hrs before sending back as i needed a return code from partmaster .
F	the title_says it all .
F	very impressive i thought , then a text and another email_telling_me the date and time to expect my goods and that if this was not convenient please arrange a different time .
M	all - in - all an ok experience but it would have been an excellent experience if a little more communication had taken place .
M	i should play that game where i work !
F	whilst trying to book flights on this website , the times and prices constantly changed .
M	definitely going to use them again in the future !
M	i had all of my services with them , needless to say that i now have none .
M	i have paid as my bank has verified and i am waiting to hear from you so i can tell my customer what ’_s happening or whether i have to return his £_000 ?
F	i couldnt get through to any one to inform them i am fustrated and want to leave vodafone totally .
F	because – you see – they don_'_t deliver to our area often !
F	i ordered a mattress_topper on 0 / 0 / 00 .
M	both failed to be delivered on time and end up arriving late by up to 0 days .
F	after months we finally got an account ,( our neighbour is still wating after 0yrs ) and they have taken erratic amounts monthly based on our brand_new smart_meter .
F	to the hour delivery time is just brilliant !
F	0_days_later was the earliest delivery .
M	well_done .
M	in 0 emails sent over a 0 week period , i have one reply .
F	i really should be getting some compensation and please use a different company or apply pressure coos looking in the internet every one says ebuyer good but stop using it because parcel forece is absolute terrible !
M	my two orders on the website were very smooth and the items were dispatched quickly , but as the delivery drivers of the courier firm that was used were unable to gain_access to the buildings , different problems occurred with each .
F	tested phones donated by parents and after they worked fully charged them , posted to fonebank .
M	when i tracked it a week_later on dpd uk website i found out they had apparently tried ( not very hard ) to deliver my parcel to me and having not succeeded taken it back to a depot .
M	well made pipe totally happy with the quality . but its no where near as flexible as i expected
F	saw the serenata_flowers just before christmas when they sent me an_email .
F	i have asked for feedback from whittards about this situation and recieved vague promises , but nothing has changed .
M	i believe that was all i would have to do and then any future payments i would do online as per normal , but no apparently , all payments to these new people will have to be done over the phone .
F	whereas , yours came in a brown envelope . so i feel really disappointed .
F	it was not delivered until the week_later .
F	considering we live in telford and they were going to middlesex - this is really inconvient .
F	yours_faithfully mrs . j . russell .
F	thanks !
M	also i was told i was gonna get a text on the day of the delivery but i never received one .
M	satisfied with the quality of the shed structure but a shame that the doors supplied did not fit resulting in a great deal of time and effort re - cutting and re - shaping to make the shed secure .
F	then when i looked at emails from them it said signed for by someone called brooks at my neighbours address , !!!!
F	excellent free return facility and refund appeared on my account within 0_days .
F	tried_calling parcel_monkey but no telephone_numbers avail .
M	i phoned them and they could not beat the offer i had but then they gave in and made it a little cheaper , so i stayed !!
M	only getting 0_star as thats the minimum allowed .
F	obviously i had no_intention of ever using connect_+ again so i said that wasn_'_t acceptable .
M	very disappointed .
F	i will happily by from this company again
M	a joy to use and i will_definitely use them again for future_purchases .
F	i rang customer centre today to chase the order - spoke to emma .
F	they also kept me updated through email , the delivery was very prompt and the flowers were lovely .
M	brilliant service oak_worktop arrived in perfict condition no knocks or dent really helpfull delivery guys . well recomended a +++
F	on my first_attempt this time to order glucosamine 0000mg the e_mail gave_me a code to enter at checkout for 00_%_discount , but as i tried to enter the code it kept coming up ` code not valid `!!?
M	can '_t fault them , delivery time is excellent , well_packaged , juice is exactly_what i expected , very impressed .
M	-- twice only recommending that i get another pair ( did the first time - £_00 . 00 )
M	to be fair both orders were placed close to bank_holidays , but this should '_ve been calculated into the estimated delivery time .
F	i have searched many places for handles as good looking as the ones i purchased .
F	out of 000 supposed suppliers no reply was recieved
F	also , despite the message clearly stating ' get well soon ' - the card selected for the message said ' happy birthday '.
F	i rang and they said the fitter had been over booked .
F	great service and competitive_prices
M	the shirts are outstanding , so much so i '_ve purchased 00 of em '.
M	on the 00th_june when they were to be shipped for 00th delivery i was called to say the pallet they were on was destroyed / damaged and new ones were being delivered on the 00th_june .
M	however i have never had h_&_c taps that turn on and off in opposite directions and i have worked in the hotel business .
M	you have proved yourself a liar and a complete fool .
F	had a issue with a parcel that the courier delivered wrong , i never got the item and after numerous_calls to their 0000 number and explaining the issue over and over again .
F	although i was assured of the best quality arrangment and service before i placed the order the flowers were delivered the day before not the day of the funeral although i received an_email_confirming safe delivery whilst_travelling to the funeral , so even the tracking of order and delivery is not a true_reflection of service provided
F	i ordered flowers to be sent to my sister in law with full address and postal code - she_lives in a tiny hamlet with few houses .
M	it said collect in store next_day at 00pm onwards , this turned_out not to be true .
M	bison removals turned_up an_hour and a half late , with a van saying hunters on it , and which was too small to fit our two bed house .
F	woop_woop .
M	unfortunately one of the macbook modules was faulty , which took me about an_hour to diagnose what was wrong .
F	i was very unhappy with my booking as it cost me an extra £_00 as apparently i had booked a crossing from calais to dover when i wanted a crossing from dover to calais .
F	it was extremely well_wrapped up with all sealed wrappers around product so i knew it was genuine .
F	ordered 00 / 00 / 00 money taken 00 / 00 / 00 no goods received .
M	one of the first places i found was boiler_juice .
F	however , they were out of the size !
M	luckily they then found my booking with my car_registration and i was allowed in .
M	if the prices to buy & sell keep rising as they have been doing , i wonder where ebay will be in five years from now ?
F	took_ages for my goods to arrive , it was so slow that i missed my mums_birthday !!
F	i ordered a camping kitchen and needed it quite urgently so i requested express delivery and paid £ 0 . 00 .
F	résultat : ma_commande a été annulée pour rien sous prétexte que fia - net avait bloqué ma_commande ( ce_qui s ' est révélé être faux ).
F	i am very well pleased with the service and will definitely use again .
F	really pleased with how much choice there was - really easy to filter through the options to find the perfect dress !
F	order went_smoothly .
M	when the order was placed i received prompted acknowledgement of the order and assurance that all orders are shipped within 00_hours .
F	the booking was really easy and the person dealing_with my booking was really friendly
F	i have now sold 0 phones and have had no_problems .
F	what can i say ordered at 0pm tuesday , delivered by 00am wednesday .
F	can '_t fault the speed of service - ordered about 0 . 00 and arrived by 0pm .
M	very rude customer service
F	they send you a dispatch email days after you receive the goods .
M	but watch out on small delivery '_s
M	i will happily pay a little extra rather_than endure such inefficient service .
M	it was a great deal and i am thoroughly pleased with both it and the service received .
M	i would use mazuma .
M	when calling i was answered quickly and the staff were very helpful .
M	united_kingdom
F	i have also been ' blocked ' by them on facebook , presumably because i had the audacity to post that i hadn_'_t received my order and was considering contacting_trading_standards .
F	a very good service .
M	rang again and told yet again 00 days .
F	fast delivery and efficient service .
M	the website is equally useless at trying to find where your parcel is .
F	perhaps you could send sms_messages with a number to call with issues , booking_reference_number , etc .
M	when i received a replacement , though , it was clear that i ' d simply received the original package with the incorrect parts taken out of the box and replaced with the new ones .
F	this product was listed in euro '_s which was confusing i thought the purchase price was $_00 . 00 in american money , it was $_00 . 00 in euro '_s .
M	it arrived very quickly but i was surprised to see that it was packed in only a single skin of cardboard .
M	would recommend to anyone .
M	however , we dropped_off car at the sheraton fishermans wharf , went down the street to our hotel and realised we had left something in the glove_box .
F	never had any_problems or troubles ever .
F	the flower arrangment i ordered was a casket arrangment for my mum '_s funeral .
F	i used national showers spares before and was impressed with efficiency and ease of use for the website , followed_by prompt delivery .
F	:-)
F	for their great value and fabulous service
F	i would and will recommend you very highly !
M	received the order very promptly and was advised too , in a most timely_fashion , exactly , within a couple of hours , when i could expect delivery - that was excellent .
M	however when speaking to my girlfriend about the flowers she said that one of the roses was just a stork , without a flowers head .
M	but first they told me they tested them themselves now they say they sent them out , but they only had them for 0 working_days before sending them back to me !
M	who really understands ' collision waiver " and even if you have it , there '_s usually an excess or stuff that isn_'_t covered eg wheels , glass , etc .
F	also to be fair , they dealt_with my order immediately .
M	scubastore is a very reliable , trustworthy website and really good service .
F	this is the first time i have bought anything from petfleas but it will not be the last .
M	two new dates were arranged but we had to postpone due to urgent family issues .
M	still_waiting on phone_call and i am guessing the delivery was attempted on sunday despite no one being in the house .
M	i saw nothing on the website to say this , so the first i knew was when i got an email from city_link . saying they would deliver that day , and would need a signature for the parcel .
F	theses flowers were for a birthday and looked nothing like the photo online !
M	they clearly have a problem and a mail forwarding service which is that unreliable is simply a service not being delivered .
M	very friendly and efficient .
M	good email communication so i knew what my order progress was without even asking .
F	i think it was a stock issue .
M	i would buy from oak_furniture_land again but i made the mistake of doing it online , go in store if you wish to buy and hope you don_'_t have any_problems as they are incredibly slow at dealing_with issues .
F	it allowed_us to start our holiday early , relax and enjoy the evening ensuring we were fresh the next_morning for our onward travels .
M	the packing seems very flimsy .
M	this company use a sub - standard delivery service who cannot be contacted by phone .
F	so i had to open another account due to the time passed but could not with my original email address so had to open a second alternative email to do this , which was not a major problem except for me because i am not conversant with the computer as others .
M	i will try to transfer all of my domains away from this terrible company !
F	i particularly_liked being_able to say i wanted my delivery to be left in the porch as i am not often at home .
F	i did as instructed & via procook direct as they were offering free_p_&_p .
F	less staff now all automated machines , less wage bill yet more cost to customer ?
F	!
F	i '_m not suggesting that this makes them an unreputable company , but i am disappointed with the way that this had been handled .
M	it now does not work properly for me does not show that blue bar in the graph !
F	unfortunately told that deliveries to my area did not take place on the one day my husband could be at home .
F	so even_though it didn_'_t work first time the second_attempt worked_perfectly .
F	however , five weeks on i still don_'_t have any photos .
F	payments made quickly .
M	i have already put one of my close friends in contact with polybags , because of their great value and very speedy delivery .
M	their products are as good , or better_than leading_brands .
M	thank_you again
M	a group of 00 lads on stag wanting to have a good time !
M	i originally phoned to place my order but was told if i ordered online i would get an email confirmation , so that is what i did .
M	it has left 0 reviews online that are both fake .
M	the slippers were purchased as a gift and were very well received .
M	over the last 0 years i have bought three guitars and several other items from guitarbitz .
F	he didn_'_t .
M	andrew
M	in short . useless , unless you like spending ( at_least ) an_hour each_month trying to buy a " goody_bag ".
M	before i finish , i just remembered that on my last order which had items ' out - of - stock ', the items were refunded ( as i requested ) but the refund was issued by cash enclosed inside an envelope - which i think speaks_volumes about their professionalism , or lack of .
F	no solutions were offered to actually provide the service i had asked of them , i was just told the policy over and over and informed that the flowers would go out the next door and " hopefully " would arrive by 0pm when i told them already that of course no one would be in to receive the flowers as she was in hospital .
F	i explained it was a christmas_present for my son but i was told that this was company policy and no exceptions were made even for christmas !
M	more annoying is that five weeks after i should have caught the ferry i am still_waiting for reimbursement of expenses and fare have driven an extra 000_miles in some very difficult conditions and missed a complete afternoon of our holiday which should have been sightseeing in ribe , denmark .
F	this begs the question as why it was listed as available on their website in the first place and why it had a delivery period of 0 - 00 days !
M	sorry physioroom , i won_'_t be buying from you again .
F	i paid for paulo nutini concert ticket which , according to their website would be delivered no later than 0_days before the event by registered mail
F	ordered nest of tables on line .
F	the delivery was very quick with good communication .
M	see_above !
F	they also offered no apology for the lateness of the delivery .
M	highly_recommended .
M	i complained the company said it wouldn_'_t happen again but when i ordered another blind same thing happened .
F	great staff
M	we cooked a roast dinner for six using the meat last sunday .
F	ordering was easy and arrived the next_day .
F	felt very let_down by superdry on christmas day !
M	one major gripe i have with vodafone is the garbage customer service , imho calling them from a vodafone mobile should be free not charged at local rate . it is free from a landline !
M	i ordered online very easily and the keys arrived on the doormat the day after .
M	shed looks to be of good quality .
F	its a con because they know people need it the same day
F	very pleased .
F	this was frustrating , but ultimately we had some - so crisis averted .
M	probably wouldn_'_t of happening if the box was packaged in another with bubble_wrap or something .
F	ive only used the gel for 0_days so hard to say if i will feel any benefit from it , but as it states on the box , one tube will last one week , so cannot_afford to continue buying it .
M	straight_away the solicitor established that the actions i were carrying out when my injury occurred were not out of the " norm " and the employer was not negligent , no case to answer .
M	only given 0_stars as only just started and yet to see the results but i can say that the strawberry_flavour tastes great even mixed with just water .
M	no sign of goods .
F	but when they got on with it job was done well .
F	i was given their customer service number to ring .
F	i love my new trees .
M	i brought a sony docking_station what was £_00 . 00 and i got it home and it didn_'_t work , and it had holes on in the speaker and that didn_'_t show or say in the description on their website .
F	i spoke to someone on the livechat application the day after the delivery was supposed to arrived and they guaranteed they would contact the florist in australia who the order was with and email asap .
M	so sometimes its a good deal , other times not , so shop around and compare , delivery time took 0 or 0 days , nothing special there .
F	the finished_product is sufficient for shed storage but the metal material is flimsy , the closed shed doors vibrate backwards and forwards in the wind and the metal trim on the edge of the roof do not extend the full_length but in two sections so not ideal .
F	i paid for next_day delivery because i needed my order quite urgently trusting i would receive it on the next_day or , latest , the day after the next_day given the fact that i placed the order in the afternoon .
M	the way they calculate interest is unlike any other reputable credit_card , and will leave you paying a fortune .
M	my advise to all avoid . avoid . avoid terrible service !
F	always very good price and always despatched_immediately with no_hassle .
F	easy to find from our hotel just up the road . we parked the car in the parking bay and booked it in with one of their friendly assistants . waited no more than 00_minutes before our bus arrived to take us to gatwick . we didnt think about our car at all on our holiday we knew it was in good hands . on our return to england the bus_stop was easy to find and buses were readily_available . when we returned to the parking office it was simple to get our car back and it had been looked after no damage etc we only wish we had paid for a car wash as the car was dusty . we were offered this .!
F	i will certainly not be using your company again in the future ."
M	their web_site is good and easy to order from .
M	as a beginner i was shown how to set_up the rod , attach weight , bait line and hook and also how to cast which was really useful .
F	!
F	i feel this is an insult to loyal_customers and i shall be looking at taking my business elsewhere .
F	they look really great on my husband .
F	yo queue up for agais yet again .
F	also the leatherette pouch is just an embarassment if you ' re giving the set as a gift , such bad quality it makes it look like the whole lot came from the poundshop .
F	although the resort_hoppa representative was very friendly , we were extremely tired and had no real explanation of how much time we might have to wait .
F	there were only 0 wine_glasses and insufficient tumblers as well .
F	the driver opened the car doors for us and sorted all our_luggage himself .
M	now i '_m trying to cancel the order but the store does not answer me .
M	other wise very good
F	!
M	half a dozen oil coats and it looks good ( wife very happy ).
F	the material the glasses are made from arn '_t the best quality in my opinion and the lenses attract a lot of dirt and dust and i constantly have to clean them and even using the duster that came with the glasses still leaves them smeared .
M	put onto these_guys by a mate .
M	i have had other issues with late or never arriving gibson guitars .
M	we bought two items from pro_cook , one was a set of knives and a knife rack which was fine , a good price and a decent set of knives .
M	i '_ve had to buy some paper to glue onto the inside , so i can write on it .
F	glasses_direct offer a great service .
M	it is the first time i have used your company after being let_down by my usual_supplier .
F	i had to ring portugal to find out whether any flowers had arrived as i had not heard which spoilt the suprise they were supposed to have been and confused the recipient who had no idea who had sent them .
M	the only bad thing i will point out is when my son put the hat on over his face , its doesnt pull down and hold its shape it keeps curling back to the shape it has when in the packet .
F	it then took 0_days for the cheque to arrive after being sent so i ended_up waiting nearly 0_weeks for my money .
M	don_'_t bother with them .
M	it took multiple phone_calls with different advisors to get my order processed and neither advisor was clear about the pricing of the package .
M	want to be lied to just so you sign a lengthy contract ?
F	i have never_experienced a problem either with the order or delivery so i '_ll be back again .
F	i would recommend this website . good prices and quality goods .
M	exactly as expected , so very happy .
F	if they could get_hold of one , why couldn_'_t powerdirect ?
M	obviously i was not made aware of this , why would anyone sign up to 0 years when they just want to trial the product for the first time ?
F	great fashion , great workmanship , great customer service , great delivery options ( depending_on how long you care to wait , if you don_'_t mind waiting , delivery is free !
F	00_mins of waiting on the phone i finally get through to parts and the man on the phone states no urgency is on the order it will be with us on friday 0_weeks since the bbq arrived .
F	i think they are out of stock but still took my money .
F	i saw this new floraqueen advert and decided to give them a try .
M	i get a poor signal at my home address
M	that '_s because of the ' other people who bought this also bought these ' prompt that shows during the ordering_process .
M	thanks
F	my worktops are now in place , oiled and i must_say they look beautiful .
F	parcels often arrive damaged , which you could put down to the delivery company or the thin boxes that are used .
M	when will companies realise that these extra_charge scams just prevent people using them again and cost them business ?
M	i can be reached on 00000_000000 during the day or in the evening .
M	inquired_about the purchase of samsung blue_ray ; was advised that it was out of stock with no know re - stock date and a suggestion that i should purchase a more_expensive unit that i did not want .
M	thought the prices were steep !
M	i told them i '_m not paying for a service i haven_'_t been able to use .
M	the correct goods then arrived promptly .
M	and it is an easy site to use .
F	have a nice day .
F	arrived on time .
M	i got two_pairs of good quality glasses both complete with sprung hinges , one with a sunglasses_tint , in about 00 days .
M	there was no details of when quadpod would be delivered ; no part order reconciliation .
M	you are fine so long as there is no issues with your order .
M	within a very short time , i received an e_- mail confirmation .
M	i think it was a week from order to delivery
M	they will allow you to get the product back but will charge you for this so you will feel , like i did , backed into a corner to accept or face losing money by paying for your property back .
F	when i received my order i discovered i was missing some items and one of the items had arrived damaged .
M	very pleased with response to questions .
M	them at full price a few weeks_ago am now disappointed to see the later heavily
M	the grouping bonus was a pleasent_surprise .
F	i had to call an 0000 number to complain .
F	appalling service and complete disregard of specifications , plus lack of communication .
M	these are true_professionals and they know the market very well .
F	i had to contact the supplier and ask for one that was appropriate for my vehicle , and recieved another curt reply - there is none available for your model of car .
F	i would never recommend using this company .
M	she made it painfully clear there was no information she could give me , and no information she was going to find out - in short she seemed proud to establish that i was on my own .
M	i chucked them and ordered from a same day florist .
M	excellent packaging too !
M	pleased with free stuff for 0st time .
F	i am very pleased with the wobble_cushion which was recommended by the nhs physiotherapist .
F	i am a very happy customer .
F	this is frustrating because i now have to contact chemist_direct to request a refund and if they want the whole shipment back i will not be available for the parcel company
M	excellent service , professional job - very happy customer
F	his van was spotless , done a great job no_fuss etc just couldn_'_t do the tracking and i '_m still_waiting for a refund or someone to call to sort something ?
F	im not sure of the details as they have not had the courtesy to give me an explanation . we had to pay for our 0st nights accommodation and for some reason were told we could not stay at the resort we had selected and paid for over 0_months prior .
F	furniture really we '_ll packaged .
M	great service , and very speedy , will use again !
F	oh , and the price was better_than_anywhere_else !
F	i cancelled the order .
F	i purchased a beauty treatment through wowcher over 0_weeks_ago , it was cancelled by the client and wowcher emailed me to let_me know i would receive a refund within 0 - 00days .
M	that ; s why i send you a return quest .
F	having heard really negative_reviews of other similar services , i was pleased to find excellent feedback from other ziffit users .
M	delivery was as requested and the recipient was truly impressed with the flowers , balloon and card .
M	i '_ve lost my money by the looks of it .
F	i decided to order a new sewing_machine as my jones machine ( bought second_hand thirty years_ago ) had seen better days .
M	save your money and find a decent company to buy from .
M	good service , competetive_prices what more could you want ?
M	this was rectified but not within a timely_manner .
F	these people steal your money .
M	highly_recommended , would use again , no_problems , graet product .
F	i love the range of products but find the processing ( picking and packing ) of the orders a bit_slow . maybe i am too used to the amazon speed of processing
M	decent enough company in general , although staff are poorly advised and are not the best for advice .
M	the worst customer service in the world , clueless staff whose only aim is to make money out of the passenger .
M	excellent service through out , package arrived very quickly , excellent quality products
M	i was lucky .
F	if your order is not something you require quickly then this is a great site .
F	the next_day i receive a text saying my package will be here between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 , i look online at 00 : 00 and it says my driver is an_hour away and the package still_hasn_'_t arrived .
M	i have and will recommend to others hostelbookers . com
F	i bought a campervan from a regular user a dealer on preloved , and it was not as_described , quite the opposite .
M	one box contained 00 broken_tiles
F	then when asked for a refund customer service not very helpful .
F	delivery was excellent i will use character . com again .
M	th booking form is not clear
M	a 00 . 00 another phone_call to be told the van driver would be phoned
M	i was upset to be treated so , my whole journey through the night was miserable .
M	picked my delivery date , everything arrived on time , as_described and packaged excellent .
M	on 0th_march was given a very competitive price but also informed this was supplied on an " order in " basis from sony with delivery 0 - 00 days . placed the order and to my surprise received an e_- mail on 00th_march showing order status as fulfilled .
F	i have tried many_times since to reach customer_services by phone but after 00_minutes usually give up .
M	the advice i have received is that the initial comment mr fernandes had used stating i had used a " lie ", amended to " not quite true " and then further amended to " not true " remains defamatory .
M	excellent quality and i plan to use it again & again .
F	many thanx
F	good discount .
M	i was not happy about this so i decided to book it via expedia website .
F	happy to use this company again , no_problems .
M	that is really a joke .
F	i '_m so glad i discovered diet_chef and having looked at the cost , it is not expensive at all .
F	first , an order i made with a 00_%_discount_code was to be delivered by december 00th , which is great because i wanted it for christmas .
F	they are amazing , very fast and friendly . easy to add funds to your account and make calls to any country .
F	very unhappy and will not order again .
F	after i made a booking , i called the customer service for some more info .
M	many firms claim to dispatch for next_day delivery if ordered before a certain time and many fail to keep to that promise .
M	these_guys could be so much_better , they need to sort_out their customer_services however it is becoming a joke .
M	i have to say i usually use vistaprint but my last order was not good so decided to try someone new for our_wedding_invitations we are so glad we did .
F	you won_'_t be surprised to learn i am now being billed for 0 lines , but wait , i notified them and they apologised for the error , promised me a refund against my new account , and promptly billed me again .
M	competitive_pricing for premium tyres .
F	when i called to see where it was , i heard a long_drawn_out problem they are having with their orders that are going through argos .
F	the items were good but the card items would have been great if not completely bent in box / this was the photo frame the place signs and the boomerangs .
M	0000000 & 0000000
M	will be using you again .
M	when the item was in stock i received an email_telling_me that it would be delivered monday 00 january , it also had a tracking_link .
F	i will be emailing photos of the flowers we received and requesting a full_refund .
F	the part itself was fine , but i do resent paying delivery charges when you know it won_'_t be successfully delivered , and it would be much more convenient to pick it up yourself .
M	excellent range of products , especially clothes for larger_sizes .
M	you ' d think with how simple it is to buy on amazon they ' d implement a similar system for sellers .
M	fonebank gave the best price for my phone and the cheque arrived within a couple of days .
F	would highly_recommend , the tyre_fitter arrived on time and was very friendly , happy & very professional .
F	when i chased delivery with cheapsmells the item was delivered very promptly .
F	i look_forward to hearing from you .
F	cs don_'_t know a great deal .
F	however , told me someone would call me to sort it tomorrow and only took a postcode to check this was in same catchment area .
M	if you can get through to the uk call_centre then they are extremely knowledgable and helpful .
F	well_packaged , with bike tools and a packet of haribos for my daughter .
F	easy site to follow when doing your order .
M	so_far i have not received anything
M	mixes_well and tastes good .
M	i am talking to someone within 0 - 0 minutes on their website and i love that they will let_me switch to other cities or even countries when i want to watch something else .
M	i will_definitely be returning soon .
M	couldn_'_t of asked for better , we knew that we would not get all of our files back due to the condition of the disk .
M	not so .
M	wanted £_00 - 00 to send small parcel sold on ebay but less_than £ 0 on collect_+
F	they ' re good too .
M	what '_s more , the speed with which they process the phones and make payment is astonishing .
M	they had my favourite continental gp0000 tyres at a very good price .
M	i wanted a replacement battery for my gransons quad_bike . i looked on 0 other web sites but could not be sure i was ordering the correct one . then i went on battery_force web_site . i keyed in the details and i was given all the overall dimensions . they all came out correct so i placed my order . recieved confirmation buy email . then another email to say it had been dispatched . it arrived by royal_mail 0nd_class after 0 days . spot on . i will be using battery_force in the future . i also got discount_voucher for any new orders i wish to make . well_done battery_force . top job
M	well after a identical conversation as the first time , tesco realized that they did not correct the mistake , and assured me from the call_center in scotland that they would deliver this same day .
M	order went well
F	totally happy .
F	good communication , did turn_up later than_expected .
F	surely an undue_delay ?
M	not only did the item arrive the next_day , but the telephone sales where really helpful and patient in identifying the correct product .
F	we have emailed wowcher twice but still no response !!
M	received emails the day before delivery and on the day giving expected delivery times , right down to a 0hr_slot , with options to reschedule if needed .
F	coffee_club have told me they are working on packaging and external data on capsules .
F	having used a rival company before i knew what to expect but was delighted at the range of products .
F	she wanted me to take as many pictures as possible and send them to petsupermarket to proof that .
M	however , it was several days before they eventually confirmed my item was available as stock was being sourced .
F	walls and floors were good to deal with and were very good value for money .
F	would recommend to freinds and family
M	still_waiting on a refund , no reply email again to inform the refund will be paid back into account .
M	and it tastes better :)
F	after a while i finally get through to a rude help_desk lady and i inform her i want to cancel my contract and she goes i cant do it as she suspects im frauding as the account is put under mr instead of mrs but has my full name surname and dob .
F	i spoke to jay at homebase who said he had arranged for collection today friday , he said no time was booked it would be sometime during the day . i booked a days leave to make_sure it was picked_up ok , well its 0pm and its still not been collected and i '_m unable to get through to homebase , i am not impressed i '_ve wasted a days leave waiting round the house for nothing . leave days are precious when you work full time . so when will it be collected ?
M	), all ok .
M	very professional , very fast .
M	!
M	i found the website easy to navigate .
M	this company knows exactly_what they ' re doing , and if this is what they do to earn_money and pay their shareholders then the future is not very bright for them .
M	however , the products are a little disappointing .
M	clearly , having faced these side - effects we decided that it was not wise for my wife to go_ahead with the same procedure .
M	so on the phone again .
M	search by registration_number is not as useful as you ' d imagine , as there were lots of wheel and tyre choices available from the factory .
M	arrived on time and fitted quickly , no_complaints would use again .
F	. again , a response within the hr fro .
M	it took one our before everything was all right and we could drive , thats not good .
F	super_fast free delivery - goods arrived next_day !
F	bit of a fiasco , initially my fault but overall not the . best service
F	having used a couple of local tyre companies , i would say that this one was possibly the best , and i will be using them again !
F	yet another phone_call to parcel_force to find that my shoes were with a neighbour .
F	my order arrived quickly however i had trouble using the capsules at first and sent two emails to the fine_coffee_club for their help but received no response .
M	the product was received in good time but was faulty ( no fault of sigma ) i have found the returns service to be exceptional .
M	enough said , i wish you well and kind_regards .
M	shopped_around for a good rate of exchange but was surprised to see a high delivery charge added to the bill at the end of the transaction as it was not mention previously .
F	poor customer service .
F	compared to other online services i have used , this was slow and annoying .
F	v quick service , v nice jumper , v happy !
F	is that theft ?
F	all in all , you can '_t go_wrong .
M	i was told the times we were given were only an estimate .
M	bought 0 adsl modems of different_types to connect to existing router .
F	no issue with the product , recipient happy and would buy again .
F	it '_s easy to rate a company excellently when things have gone well but i would recommend them with even more confidence since i had a problem that they resolved with so little stress for me .
F	live the updates through the day when flowers are on way x
F	i have had numerous orders from diet_chef to this address so to claim they could not find the house is not true . they also had a mobile number & a house number .
F	and easy to talk too and willing to help with any issus you may with buying goods from them
F	those big companies like b_& q and homebase might be generic , but .
F	random paperbag designs are 00_% christmas logos . how can i use them .
M	what can i say , i applied online ( monday ), got a bag well a small box ( wednesday ) posted on ( thursday ) and about 00_hours_later ( friday ) money was put in my account i was blown_away by the services , contact and all_round ease of selling my old_phones .
M	they simply took my payment and did nothing .
M	it would have been with me the next_day but it was late in the afternoon when i placed my order which is fair_enough .
F	i shortly had an_email back to say " due to my rude email they were cancelling my order ".
F	many_thanks
M	i have to return a cd because it wouldn ; t play the last track , and the amount of money i was allowed to spend on the return was 00p less_than the post_office price .
M	our usual provider responded in time to our order but by mistake delivered the canine equivalent .
M	their web_site is helpful and easy to navigate through when comparing different lenses .
F	wally departed in such a hurry he failed to get me to complete any paperwork .
F	however , i was advised by your company that i should send my phone using special delivery , but you didn_'_t make it clear to me that you wouldn_'_t pay for it .
F	i emailed last night including pictures but still_awaiting reply .
M	. at_least they did have the washing_machine this time , and , luckily , we were in to take delivery !!
M	i was highly disappointed that my trophy arrived broken and i was forced to buy some super_glue to fix the trophy .
F	going on the 00th .
F	always order with serenta because there has_been no_problems with flowers or delivery
F	would not recommend this company to anyone .
M	i '_ve only just purchased this policy and it hasn_'_t even come into force yet .
M	plenty of choice and reviews to help you choosing tyres , very happy with finding a close fitting_centre , good value for money for my freelander 0 .
F	i '_ve_used them to send flowers to many of my friends and - without_exception - they have all been delighted .
M	cheers , great , nice one , the sunniest day of my year spent indoors waiting for sunglasses .
F	i didn_'_t bother to return the game and just kept it , how many other people are like me and can '_t be bothered to complain ?
F	no effort was made to investigate_further which i find unsatisfactory , especially when they themselves did not know what was causing the delay .
M	a clone of pc_world website . and only has same costing as store .
M	but no .
M	the waiting time is wayyyyy to long !, another problem that needs to be sorted is retailers need to be held_accountable when they do not keep their end of the deal !
M	i had a think over a cuppa and decided to just type " floating shelf_brackets " in my search_engine .
M	p . s .
M	after experiences of john_lewis ( nice stores but difficult to try anything out and very limited for real hifi separates ) and richer_sounds ( the less said the better ), i was very pleasantly_surprised to find that the old_fashioned approach of courtesy , helpfulness and expert friendly advice could still be found in the high tech age !
F	so pleased with the product , children delighted but just wish i was happier with the legs and being_able to move the trampoline for mowing the grass without a real danger of it collapsing .
M	great products but website crashed on me and products delivered to wrong place before being retrieved and sent back to me .
F	it will definitely be serenata for me next time i want flowers for someone overseas
F	we arrived 0 minutes till 0 only to discover the bus already gone .
F	i was kept_informed of my orders all the way from the dispatch to exactly when they would arrive on my doorstep .
M	as a student with a small family , my finances are very limited and thus i purchase my monthly groceries to be sufficient for the month before paying all other bills .
M	i was going to video them being packed if i ever used them again , however this is a common_practice - see other posts .
M	about 0_weeks_later i have just received a bill for £_000 for screen damage .
F	many_thanks !
F	its pure greed that it takes this long because they suck up as much interest with your money as they can .
F	a neighbour spotted them in my mothers garden .
F	cant_fault the service and value
F	do not understand_why all clothing is split between brands and then into different sections .
M	i was surprised to see that i would be offered £_000 for my 0 year_old 00gb 0g model .
F	i spoke to the " secretaria de turismo " ( tourist board ) and they dont even know what i was talking_about !
F	when i phoned the company on the email , that gave_me another company to ring , when i rang them , they said it was any time up till 0 0 ' clock !
M	feel the system is let_down by bad deliveroies , sad .
F	no .
F	its nice to see a company that puts the needs of peoples pets before their costs , which also helps those of us who have to look after every_penny we have .
F	ich hatte mir einen schoenen blumentrauss ausgesucht und musste dann feststellen das der gelieferte blumenstrauss ganz anders aussah .
M	both failed to be delivered on time and end up arriving late by up to 0 days .
F	recommended
M	i may as well go direct to the insurer and haggle for a better price and definitely get a discount .
M	ordered a bike ( didn_'_t ask foe bike to be built , just sent in original_packaging ) and other bits and requested next_day delivery , no info when ordering that bike would not be set next_day .
F	i do think this service is getting poor , i remeber you could get your first bid within 00min it was excepted , not now the bids are ridiclous its laughable , my wife used the same courier , s if she can , courier , s come and go . my wife as used this service for 0yrs , it was great , courier were reliable , you got a good service all_round , i used this service because its straigt_forward but you do wait a long time for a good bid offer
M	in summary - good deals but not so good service .
F	i ordered a plastic greenhouse and the order was accepted and payment taken .
M	despite several e_- mails beforehand , when i placed my order on - line i did not recieve goods .
M	the instructions i received did not explain how to fix the vertical slats on once you had fitted the top rail { steps 0 - 0 ), i had hung some vertical_blinds before so knew how to fix the weights and links on , but a novice would have had a few problems .
F	i was able to choose delivery date , but in the small_print it did state that if no one was home to take delivery , you could be charged the same again to re - deliver .
F	iam never going to use the website again i had to wait a week and a half for my money nd im not at all empressed soo if use are goin to use this i should make_sure that you read everything before sendin your phones
F	i didn_'_t even look at the paper instructions .
M	thought i would try the dog '_s doodahs , so i personalised a card , ordered it on the monday , first_class post and needed it for the friday and did not receive it .
M	my items were ordered and paid for , and i was offered a delivery time to suit me , all done fantastic .
F	it would not be much good if you frequently needed to adjust the shower_head up or down , but if it can stay mainly in one position , it '_s perfect .
M	the phone i gave mm was a nokia_e00 in " good " condition , but not " good " condition that i ' d feel_comfortable selling to someone i knew .
F	a better car than i had booked .
M	shame as everything else went well but feel a little let_down by this as this cash_back offer enabled_me to pay off existing contract .
M	there is no recognised union and so if you complain you will be summarily dismissed .
M	i ordered my girlfriend flowers to be delivered to her work on valentines_day , the flowers arrived and are gorgeous and she_loved them .
M	first delivery attempt ' hermes ' signed for the package in my name and never delivered the product .
F	friday i contacted them again by phone ( their hold tune drives you nuts aswell ) they informed me that the goods had not been loaded_onto the vehicle for that day because they had no space left !!
F	i have used other_sites before and it has taken weeks !
M	the two to dublin were never again to be repeated i will fly with air lingus from now on .
M	later that evening we rang to find out what was going on , only to be told that nothing was happening because the engineer had reported that there was no access to the leak !
M	a verey easy experiance all_round
F	the only issue , but it is quite a big issue was that some of the tins of cat_food were damaged in transit which_meant that when i opened the tins , the food was mouldy !
M	when there was a question needing clarification there was no time wasting , no holding on - nor where we given the run around .
M	firstly , the ' how to ' video didn_'_t match the actual needed activity .
F	that '_s my guess anyway .
M	postage is fast and packaging is perfect .
M	follow this up with quick delivery and an ecxellent case - i really can '_t fault my experience .
F	i double_checked the description and called ebuyer as the description clearly said ' this brother_dr - 0000 black_cartridge .' having a legal background i know the importance of proof and therefore took a screenshot of the desciption page .
F	wouldn_'_t use this company again .
M	been using topcashback for a number of years and found the whole_experience easy .
M	duff all gone .
M	after nearly seven weeks they finally agreed to give me a refund which i am still_waiting with eager anticipation .
F	i telephoned to ask if wowcher could assist in helping with availability however they quickly advised i had to call the merchant who said i then had to pay more money if i wanted the date advertised .
M	the sites fine , took me a few mins to understand how to navigate around so i could sell my dvd , s .
F	made my husband very happy on valentine '_s day .
F	would definelty recommend and use again .
F	definitely recommend oak_furniture_land products .
M	yet their website misleads you by comparing their prices with bt and talktalk who allow unlimited minutes in their call allowance .
F	received an e_- mail to advise me of delivery day and time but unfortunately i was out at work .
F	they claimed i was out and there was no one to sign for the package , however it said on the website my package hadn_'_t even of left the depot station .
F	we all want one . there is a fight over who is going to sit on them because they are so comfy !
M	i just do not have the time to complain over it , but if it was a gift i would be far more disappointed and take it further .
M	nearly all installed now ( overcoming vw canbus system )
M	!!
F	i accidently ordered 0 costumes the polite lady from customer_services contacted me to double_check .
M	the website shop would not let_me despatch the goods to a place other than the billing_address and would not record the fact that i wanted gift_wrap etc .
F	because at_least , sta is really reliable and trustworthy .
F	yes i did get the rest of the order but i was annoyed that i only knew of the out of stock item when i emailed .
M	can consumers then trust the reviews placed on trustpilot ? and are trustpilot actually unbiased or simply just protecting the retailers to publish and promote high scores ?
M	i politely requested that he jog - on , and told_him to send me a final_bill , and i would pay the full_amount , leaving their services immediately afterwards .
M	once i received on time the other due in a further 00 days .
F	recently i have been getting terrible headaches and a pain behind my left eye , so i had an eye_test and found that my left eye had worsened .
M	i would suggest that if you want a particular item from this store , bypass them and go direct to the manufacturer or use a different stockist to avoid stress and disappointment .
F	if they used my hermes it would be cheaper !
F	but not very impressed with the flowers !!!
F	to be told , it '_s possibly lost .
F	i will definitely not be using you again .
M	but check out carefully what the deals are in the countries you plan to visit .
F	my delicate order arrived in perfect_condition and a couple of days earlier_than i expected .
F	very informative .
M	tbh i could have bought better from morrisons for a tenner .
M	bit_tight into the lock at first but now they are perfect !
M	they were sorry and they would refund me half the cost .
F	i can '_t_believe_how easy and quick this was .
M	i got what i ordered quickly
M	ended_up paying triple for the parking place .
M	note to self , always wear headphones when entering shop to drown out the sales_pitch :)
F	this is apparently your reason for not posting its eh00kww0y0sb0h .
M	as instructed by trading_standards we will be writing via_recorded delivery , stating our case .
F	i recently ordered a wowcher for an item of clothing over a month_ago .
F	original order no .
M	0 ) the front zip allows me to overcome ' inconvenient convenience ' problems associated with a rear zip .
F	the cost of the complete pack , with the plinth was around £_00 , so i decided to order the complete pack , only to be told then that they were out of stock and even if they were in stock i would not receive them the next_day as it was too late for a next_day delivery .
M	i would never recommend this company and i will never buy from them again .
M	easy to order and very competitive price .
M	updated - 00 / 0 / 00 - from two stars to one , £_000 spend yet still no reply in regards to the complaint !
F	also needs intumescent mastic but none provided with this purchase .
M	if the frame was not cracked i would have trusted their judgement and cycled through london with a set of bars almost sheared through .
F	i wont_be ordering of them again as i ordered the wrong_size and when trying tyo send back they said they dont do returns the mad thing is i had to order the right size so they could have picked the wrong one up when they dropped the new one off at no cost to them .
M	they weren_'_t brilliant then , but since they became talk_talk they became one of the worst companies to deal with that i have ever_experienced .
F	product well made and value for money except that one of the extension flaps did not quite fit and needed some manoeuvring to get it to fit .
M	it was very easy to find the right memory on this web_site , all i had to do was enter the make and model number of my laptop and up it came !
M	even their website has no security certificate , so who_knows when your details end up .
F	tried your capsules .
F	the next reply was in german , i think , but was no better .
F	we ordered on the 00th_december_0000 with the claim next_day dispatch and the goods have not arrived .
F	i also made sure someone was home all next_day but still no delivery .
M	hopeless .
M	that was the last time i will use ryanair .
M	i couldn_'_t fault the car or the ease of hiring on line .
F	!
F	would recommend them .
M	possibly the best uk site for flashlights , batteries , chargers for the serious user .
M	hello again ,
F	also , there seems to be no way to sign off from repeat offender ' vip ' promotional text_messages and emails .
F	ordered item one night two_days_later it was delivered brilliant service try them
F	i asked for help and he put my cases in the car for me begrudgingly .
M	initial switch went well problems started after 0 month review tried to increase dd by 00_% customer_services didnt want to know wouldnt return phone_calls , e_mails , i had to stop dd to make them contact me all staff agreed new dd stupid but unable to stop increase after stand off reverted to original monthly dd then they didnt take dd was threatened with baliffs ect ended uo in last_year paying 00 months dd plus final_bill of £_00 have now left never again you have been_warned !
F	however i do not understand_why the burgers had been previously frozen as there is no way that my husband and i would eat 00 burgers when they arrived , we cannot re freeze them and so they have been thrown_away , what a terrible waste of food and money !!!!
M	never answered the phone to respond to query .
F	i '_m just fed_up and this is the second time they have treated me so badly .
F	finally , i managed to speak to someone but it seems my complaint had not been processed .
F	update to sports and leisure reply :
F	really bad service from yodel - waited around for my delivery that was meant to be on van and due for delivery but it was a friday so the driver went back and said no one was home .
M	he / she says you need to be investigated further urgently by a specialist .
M	i would highly_recommend .
F	for that reason i wont_be ordering again .
F	received e_mail 0_days latter saying jacket was not available due to stock problems .
M	never_heard a thing for 0 months , so i contacted them , they just told me there was nothing wrong with the tyre .
M	costume arrived on time and it is good quality !
F	i love cheap smalls and it is very convienient .
M	the order confirmation made no reference to the delay , and viewing the order on the website did not help .
F	poor communication_skills .
F	excuse me , you take a mistake on my name , please correct it , my name is chen , wen - chi
F	my one honest tip is , this is not special amazing food , it is stuff you can make a lot tastier and cheaper , it is just smaller_portions .
F	so no one was home to receive them they were left at back of house and got wind / cold damaged .
M	as you can see from the picture my cat has taken ownership of the chair and i might have to get a second one !
M	totally disappointed that they don_'_t live up to promises or indeed their side of a contractual arrangement .
F	i actually prefer this style as_opposed to having to sit_down and wait to be served .
F	their website claims most blinds can be delivered within 0 - 0 working_days .
F	you can '_t go_wrong , take my advise shop there with confidence
F	better communication would have given 0_stars .
M	fast and reliable
F	i would honestly recommend this store and its supplier / delivery team to you .
M	we complained on the saturday and were told we ' d be added to a club guest_list for saturday_night .
F	however i was also told that i needed to make_sure that the beginning of the print started at the beginning of each box .
F	will definitely order same again
F	the back of the top part of the wc is not straight and it does not align with the rest of the unit .
M	i flew successfully from christchurch to sydney , but in sydney i was told by the airline company that my booking had been done but not confirmed by tripsta .
F	and that i know is not beautybays fault , but they never answerd my emails .
M	i had spent time searching out the snow_peak camping range and found the prices a bit hefty to say the least .
M	after 0 days and several_attempts , the key managed to work .
F	it was just a shame that the villa wasn_'_t fully_equipped before arrival .
M	why do computer manufactures bundle a trial version of the mcafee " anti_virus " software . answer .
M	as above_says it all , got the best prices in an easy way to compare .
M	highly_recommended .
F	quick friendly advise and service .
M	they do give options such as paying £ 0 to have the parcel delivered to the nearest post_office but as i don_'_t work near where we live , this is no option as its always closed when we are around .
F	i ordered 0 items one friday_evening after 0pm and they arrived before teatime saturday , amazing service .
M	it is , in my opinion , total over priced rubbish that can '_t be removed once your " free " updates expire and thus prevents installing free anti_virus alternative software .
M	the flash isn_'_t a year_old and it has failed , now this in it self isn_'_t a great problem as all of the products on the digital toy shop website have at_least a 0 year_warranty .
M	the vase was beautiful and very good value and the chocolates were delicious but i '_m afraid we most definitely will not be using this service again .
F	she knew the difference_between all the tables and was able to help me decide which one would be best for my budget .
M	i wasnt quite sure what i wanted to dress as and with the amount of choices on offer , this wasn_'_t made any easier .
M	it is not a major_issue , but these books are not cheap and should be packed with sufficiently robust_packaging to survive delivery undamaged .
F	the credit_card issue is not my issue , which is how i was made to feel .
F	when i booked my recent experience i entered the code but the reduction was not made so i am very disappointed but honestly feel i was misled .
M	excellant website , my order arrived the next_day and a great cd radio with all the correct fittings too .
F	i was very please with the delivery of the flowers but very disappointed in the amount of flowers i received for the money i spent .
M	00 . 00am came , no delivery , citylink saying they rang the depot and it was definitely out on the van and the driver was nearby .
F	for some reason our company name was not put onto the box so the delivery company were unable to deliver without speaking to us and rearranging .
F	i have used chemist_direct a number of times before and was very happy , however , this time i '_m not happy at all .
F	ordered flowers well in time for valentine '_s day then got an e_- mail at 00 :_00pm on the 00th_feb to say the courier can '_t find the address ?
M	sorry its been so long for an update but have been unwell ( this case being a contributory factor )
F	good selection .
F	easy to use site , great range of products although not everything i wanted was on the site , fab prices , great service i would recommend to others and will buy from them again x
F	money paid as quoted , used pre_paid postage .
F	or at the very least – if you want it in a hurry , for a specific reason , for a specific date ?
M	they said they had it in their warehouse and i could have it in 0 working_days .
F	yes , i did say to my friends about this deal .
F	i have just booked them to go to gatwick
F	i got a response which made no sense whatsoever so re emailed and never_heard back .
M	they worked !!

M	the stand is very good - sturdy , compact and fits the instrument well .
F	many_thanks .
M	nobody in authority was available to speak to me and i was promised a phone_call back on monday .
M	i got a lovely_bunch bunch for twice the size at £ 0 more .
F	this is the second time i have ordered from this company and my experience this time was worse_than the last .
F	speedy free delivery and clear delivery times to suit anyone .
M	i '_ve only used skiddle once so_far , but they '_ve asked for my opinion and so_far i ' d say above_average .
F	i live in the us but my mother - in - law lives in england .
M	i was very impressed firstly with the price of the product i wanted and the way the whole order was handled .
F	all l had to do was measure the item l wanted framed , pick the size and dimensions of mount and they sort the size of frame for it .
F	emailed company twice , zero response .
M	i can do this but thought the idea was they saved me the hassle .
F	refund obtained , although i was a bit_miffed that i had paid £ 0 . 00 for postage and
F	the toilet_seat was scratched upon unpacking the item but my plumber obviously fitted the toilet anyway rather_than leave us without a toilet .
M	the packaging showed no sign of water_damage so goodness_knows where the damp came from - even the lining and laces looked fine .
M	navigating it was fine , and the confirmation emails reassuring .
M	on our return around lunchtime on a thursday , the shuttle was waiting on the pick - up road outside the airport but as we approached the vehicle he drove_off and left us there !
M	we had only one truly poor engineer assist us and he was removed from our support case after a week of failing to progress matters ( not that this ultimately expedited a resolution ).
F	asked relevant_questions and completed the process quickly .
F	i will always use petmeds for worming my dogs and i use
F	lenses fabricated incorrectly , absolutely unusable .
M	i didn_'_t wait_until now , you made me remove my original review as you blackmailed me in order to receive my refund !
F	assured by assistant that i would still be able to get swapables on this new contract including sky sports as with my old orange contract .
F	they even price matched the item .
F	i must_say i am unimpressed with the communication .
M	at no stage did they apologies or offer to clean it themselves ( the marks are difficult to remove on such a delicate finish ).
F	for my continued custom i would request some recompense .
F	i didn_'_t expect it to happen so quick as i sent them my mobile and the very next_day they posted the cheque .
F	nightmare to get to for us !
F	i would certainly order from work wear express again but would not order the type of t shirt purchased this time .
F	the only_thing that would stop me using this website again was the delivery company !
M	“ hi there !
M	the product selection is pretty good and the web shop is clear and easily_navigable .
M	seemed a haggle of competitors touting for business .
M	not up to much to be honest .
M	the oldham branch staff ( a lady ) was not at all concerned that we where unhappy , she was extremely blasé in fact rude .
F	but know i can use this one will be reordering in the near_future
M	they kept me up to date on the state of my order by email and the saw was on my doorstep at 0000 the next_morning .
F	have tried several_times_now to order online .
F	i would be very reluctant to use this service again .
M	great news as it saves me quite a bit of money .
M	i will not be using this site again as the tablet turned_out to be more_expensive than buying from a uk store .
F	great company , great tiles .
F	however the final product was not quite what i was expecting , the card was very flimsy , like a cheap christmas card and the detail was not as i imagined .
M	after 0 days that is not acceptable .
F	it is annoying when you could have bought these goods elsewhere and got them .
M	a lot of others could_learn from this , as it should be .
M	please_please people mark my words and pay the extra few_pounds for a proper insurance_cover as you will be throwing your money away like i did .
M	the flowers were smelling and some of them were completely withered .
M	its all good and well saying " great i get my insurance £ 0 cheaper_than the other_places " however as far as i am concerned i may as well have thrown that money away because im never going to get my phone back .
F	i found the boots i was looking for and within four days of placing the order , they arrived !
F	very good service .
F	i paid 0k for minimal improvement in my sight , very disappointed .
M	the ' muller is wonderful .
M	i felt that paying to return the trousers was unfair as many other online shops its free returns and i felt urban_industry were partly_responsible for the trousers not being what i expected
F	ahhhh !
F	guess_what - no refund
F	excellent service
M	some idiots could easily take the whole packet in one go !!!
F	delivery was prompt and the 0 hour time_slot very helpful if a little on the early side !
M	i '_m not hopeful .
F	very highly_recommended !
M	next order was needed next_day , paid for next_day delivery but items not sent .
F	i was told that if my tickets didnt arrive then i should get a refund ??!
M	i do not believe a nissan_note has any similarities to a vw_golf .
M	if you are thinking of buying a bike or parts , be wary , i have been left fuming on numerous_occasions and am still_waiting for my bike to be fixed .
M	but i will say that i have sent back a pallet of tiles before as they looked a mess on the lorry and they sent me back what must have been seconds as the tiles we warped .
F	when no one arrived we called and were told they were running really late with no one available until at_least 0 . 00pm .
M	good transaction no_problems
F	post was rather slow and box was crushed when it arrived , although i was kept up to date with order process with emails .
M	hope wood has_been seasoned properly .
M	in the end it was all good because i received some better pairs of skiies at the same price .
M	then they said it was sent to the wrong_address and didn_'_t have another phone to replace it .
F	in he meantime , my hubby has ordered a garden_shed which was delivered without the base supports that keep it off the ground .
F	extremely disappointed .
F	great service !
F	!
F	the agency had failed to tell her my requirements , wasting my time and hers .
F	partmaster advised me they don_'_t supply them with the slide arm and said i could get one from any diy_store .
M	the full day tour was far too long but that was our choice .
F	good prices .
M	yes she said , that will be fine .
M	i '_m dealing_with human_beings and 0 . they care about the customer and are not after a quick buck .
M	still nothing .
M	would use them again without_hesitation
M	update_: within an_hour of posting this , ben from rotten_apples rang me to apologise ( apparently they ' re moving premises and it '_s affected their service ) and offer a full_refund .
M	compared to competitor prices gizzmo is high ( even with the offer it '_s over 0 * more_expensive ) and the delivery was slower ( eg i often get it the next_day ), so although gizzmo might appeal to technical specialist i do think it needs to offer something unique to encourage people like me back .
M	the major_issue i have with the company is that almost every time i place an order i find that when i open my parcel there are multiple items missing as they , according to the company , have become out - of - stock ( or in some circumstances were found broken in the warehouse ) since placing the order .
M	i '_m looking_forward to trying these products on my next long_distance run .
M	the car had not been washed / cleaned before delivery .
M	i ordered a pair of fitflops from this company on 00 / 00 / 00 .
F	delivered as promised and earlier_than_anticipated !
M	all very good value .
M	i will be using them again in the future .
M	sorry but i wasn_'_t made aware it would be delivered so late , if i had i would have got them a day earlier .
M	would not use this company again .
M	thought ihad ordered the same again on 00 december
F	coming_back we found we had to pay the parking ( not had that before ) and we didn_'_t know and had no english money to hand , so we had to unpack a case by the barrier to find some coins .
M	the most unprofessional company ever !!!!
F	i phoned to ask if they supplied rings with the shower pole to be told " shower poles , we don_'_t sell shower poles we are bathstore " i then panicked thinking i had in fact bought from a fake store !!!!!
M	easy to fit with clear_instructions
F	i was pleased with the easy to use website and speedy delivery , delivery guys were very friendly and helpful , however this service was spoilt by a pushy after sales call to pay £ 0 . 00 a month for free parts / repair service on a washer that had just cost the best part of £_000 and had 0yrs warranty .
F	sold it through a competitor who happily paid £_00 for it !
M	i took photos of the damage and sent them to groupon asking for a refund .
M	first_class experience .
F	the only point i would make is that since this transaction i have noticed that another company pays for the special delivery of the phone ( s ) whereas i paid nearly_£ 0 .
F	i would recomend to anyone .
F	we got your money now sod_off !!
M	i have used serentaflowers twice_now and they delivered on time and the flowers arrived on time and in lovely condition .
M	finally , their only form of contact is via_email or on - line chat .
M	use them . no_hesitation in recommending .
F	won_'_t use power direct ever again .
M	sadly boohoo '_s incompetence kept the item moving around their depots but never getting to me or even contacting me .
F	can definitely recommend this company for their professionalism and customer service .
F	they cannot deliver when promised and you cannot_speak to anyone to find out why .
F	this company made an extremely difficult time even more difficult .
M	hopeless to have issues like this as the product has not been fully tested and developed .
F	i would reccomend it to anyone
M	in this case , buyers have to wait 00 working_days if the seller refuses to communicate before they can get their money back ; this is in addition to the 0 days the buyer probably waited already before filing the claim .
M	purchased on line and was encourage to add further items to achieve free delivery .
F	excellent service from_start to finish .
F	i searched online for these handles then came_across my tub i sent a cheque which made the delivery a little_longer but that my choose very happy with goods so nice to flush the toilet again and cheaper_than ebay
F	as i was changing internet service providers and was left without internet for two_days , i initially phoned them up to order the car_seat .
M	i was happy with the service , but slightly_disappointed with the product .
M	the approach by the company to open state here that my experience included " a lie " is unacceptable and defamatory particularly given it hadn_'_t provided any facts about having received the goods prior to the request for my feedback .
F	dog kibble was sent rather_than puppy_food however they were quick to recognise and correct once i contacted them , would still use again .
M	had trouble with the site , steven contacted me quickly and resolved the issue with no_problems and had a great follow_up service as well .
M	this way if i am unable to make it to the event and want to give my ticket to a friend , i can simply give my friend the ticket print - out , rather_than having to give them my bank card .
F	received text_messages to say what was happening to my order .
F	happy to pass details of product to other people and have done so .
F	to be perfectly honest i have ordered from simply in the past and had no_problems but this company is now nothing but pathetic excuses and no action .
F	quality item though - glossy and well made !
M	i emailed but got no reply , i called twice and the first time i was told the courier would email me , the second one said that it had been despatched but couldn_'_t give me the details .
M	they seem to be of excellent quality although i haven_'_t used them all yet .
M	not happy as wouldn_'_t have booked if i had of been told the truth .
M	ordered twilight delux flowers for mother '_s day .
F	i will_definatly use them again .
M	also the cleaners wouldn_'_t get_rid of a dead cockroach , they called for someone_else , but we were supposed to deal with them !!!
F	the quote came out more_expensive however still very reasonable and affordable for cystic fibrosis that has required iv antibiotic treatment in the last 00 weeks and cfr diabetes .
F	the sally_hansen serum is a definite good buy , i '_d had problems with packing to move home but a week '_s use and the improvement is very noticable .
M	.
M	the reception at drop_off in carlisle was efficient , simple and the staff were courteous and very helpful .
M	so having received every part for the pc within_00hours of ordering it from the website , i could then potentially be without the faulty part for 0_weeks allowing for delivery .
F	love them and recommend them wholeheartedly .
F	can be daunting on new customers , so best to look into any glitches and not get complacent .
F	00th_april_0000 , their reply was that the item wouldnot arrive with them until after the easter holiday and they would be sending my package with ' highest priority ' and that they had upgraded my postage to next_day delivery free of charge .
F	i ordered my products and it arrived 0_days_later , wrapped in the most spectactular way .
M	0000 customer service prem rate no ,££ customer service operators work from asia very poor english
M	since posting the review , i '_ve had several emails from the proviation md , who has_been very helpful , apologised repeatedly , and given me a gift_voucher for a future order .
M	tnt said i could ask pcbuyit to get the delivery charge refunded , as some small compensation for the day - and - a - half i had to wait in at home .
M	delivery at 0 o ' clock is not good enough unless i '_m told beforehand .
M	stay well clear of this company !
M	i used this service 0 yeas ago as well and got more money for my phone , both were high end htc startphones but the most_recent was very powerful and i was surprised to be offered a third less .
F	although i gave the correct number off the lock , the keys did not fit .
M	updated again following comments !
F	had a great experience purchasing from petfleas and will purchase from them in the future .
F	price very good and voucher gave discount plus free_postage as over_£_00 .
F	dont understand_why i can '_t pay off the balance , i have enough money in my account , my details are up to date .
F	quality was reasonable considering the extreme snow etc .
M	i got what i paid for it was four mats for a freelander and it came on time they where cheap , i wish i had paid another £_00 for the proper ones , these where thin and the smell of rubber is so strong it smells like a durex factory ,
M	other wise good service
F	0_days passed and my package had not been delivered .
F	paid next_day delivery and my order came 0_days_later !!!
M	brilliant !
M	i am impressed .
F	i had not made something clear and they phoned to check my requirements before sending out my new skies which i received within a few_days of placing the order .
F	obviously i complained and cancelled my direct_debit with first_utility .
M	very reliable
M	would recommend to anyone
M	also the transfer service for gold car at fiumicino is a nightmare , 0_seater minibuses and a scrum to get on one competing with parkinggo car_park clients . not good when there are 0 of you and two are elderly ( age reduces scrumming ability ).
M	hurray !
F	i will definitely recommend this firm to others .
M	i '_ve still got about 00 months on my contract with them , but i '_m more than tempted to fork_out how ever many hundreds of pounds it '_ll cost to be rid of them for good .
F	true to word the ramp was delivered the following week but when we unwrapped it it was the folding type which are more_expensive but we were not asked to pay the difference .
M	avoid .
M	maybe you should add paypal to your payment options or once a successful purchase has_been made log the details so that there is no need for security check everytime .
F	where the image stretches across my chest , it is all jagged and looks terrible !!
F	we called for advice re the water_damage to our new summer house .
F	they simply don_'_t have a concept of customer service .
M	my previous_supplier ( sky ) never missed a single beat .
M	i would also say that the chocolate is not of the highest_quality .
F	it was a pain but looking into it , unfortunately it '_s not unusual for deliveries by this company , it seems that a lot of people have problems with deliveries not arriving on huge specified date .
M	chose our design and ordered .
F	just hearing her again gives me a headache !
F	if i have to book my baggage direct with ba , why on earth would i bother booking a package deal in the first place ?!
M	i said i did not mind this but why on earth was i allowed to drive off without being offered this .?
F	recently ordered jumpers and recieved i item when should have been two !!!!!!!!
F	apparently my email address wasn_'_t in their records !
M	i was pleased with the speed of delivery but not so pleased when i was expected to help_unload it off the van , i '_ve got a very bad ankle and could hardly lift the crate .
M	when you contact customer_support you rarely get any actual support or service .
M	lovely_flowers but left_outside house without ringing bell when occupants were in
M	sent a parcel via_parcelforce global express on 00th_december_0000 , suppose to deliver via_fedex in moscow .
M	generally elc items are good for children and of satisfactory quality .
M	of course we have only had time for one short road trial , but we feel_confident that these electric bikes will help us get our mobility back , as they are very easy to ride and only require the slightest pressure on the pedals .
F	i '_d glady recommend westin gormet to anyone and can '_t wait to have enough room in the freezer to try some more .
F	i have requested a total refund as the mistake was clearly the trainline '_s - but their customer service is rude ( calling me a liar ), abrupt and at times hard to understand as their english is poor .
M	i called big_dug and they promised to replace them .
M	however i would have hoped that currency_solutions would check this first before transferring the money , because the end_result is that it cost me usd $_00 .
M	the salesman seemed surprised when i explained the deal my wife was offered by
F	reasonable delivery time - extortionate delivery costs .
F	they basically said we should expect this if we booked with a budget service .
F	mum said that they were nice but not as good as some of the bouquets i had received during my recent illness .
M	contact details ?
F	did accept it though as couldnt be bothered to get it sent back and off to someone_else .
F	just as i expected , second to none .
F	it is excellent quality and looks fantastic .
M	advice of delivery e_- mails were misleading .
M	the irony is that i sold some things on ebay because times are tough for everybody at the moment and i am out of pocket , ebay had their cut and paypal and i have to refund the recipient too !!
M	amazon '_s business reputation is going to be tarnished by even being associated with these_cowboys .
M	i '_ve ordered items a few_times from pharmacy0u now and they have never_let_me down .
F	when i complained , they were rude and sarcasitc and did not deal with my complaint in a professional_manner .
M	after expecting delivery a couple of days after paying to .
M	00kg in 00 boxes which i paid £_000 in courier fees and the driver refused to take 00 feet further to the lift and dropped them just inside the front_door , so whilst they met their obligations , by no means was it a good service .
F	took pics sent email also telephoned to speak to customer service advisor who said get phone_call saturday or monday which didn_'_t happen so that '_s not good
M	they give you a great service and usually postage paid if you use click and collect , so easy .
F	the process of returning the goods was going to be more complicated so i will keep the goods - but probably wont buy again .
F	well_done rivervale .
F	the quality of their blinds is top_class , their service , speed and reliability is second to none .
M	this company is a farce , like others , if i could give - 0 i would .
M	how is that a ) safe , or b ) good service ?
M	i was waiting the whole day to hear any news from my friend but suddenly received an email which said :
M	they were fitted_locally to me and was really easy to book on line .
F	the products are such very good quality but the delivery process lets the company down_badly .
M	he was already my friend , so i had no idea what he was going on about , however i followed the link , intending to give him some click to confirm rather_than ignore him , but found i actually had to join the thing to do so .
F	last order only took 0_days .
M	those that were in stock arrived within 00_hours .
F	i was giving 0days to collect at local workshop at bishop strotford
F	this time it was not in stock as indicated but a prompt phone_call alerted us to the problem .
M	once by a general garage in leeds and again recently by a mickey_mouse , country garage in somerset more noted for its restoration of old sunbeam cars than tyre_fitting .
F	vi_havde brug for hjælp med bagagen men_det kunne_ikke lade sig gøre der_var mange elevatoer .
M	superb customer service
F	tatiana was great
F	give them a try - once they were always the cheapest but sometimes it '_s cheaper on amazon .
M	!
F	not good enough , how long was i supposed to wait !
M	i told them you are now making me want to leave you for good now , she said " ok bye "
M	£ days_later no call .
M	after_searching on travelsupermarket . com , ebookers came up with the best price .
M	after quite a few attempts managed to get through and insisted on speaking to their sales_manager , who is alex featherstone .
F	i emailed towels_r_us on 00 september asking when it had been sent .
M	i asked for some form of good will gesture as i was out of pocket from buying the local product at higher cost , but this was glossed over and not made reference to .
M	reliable , kept_informed of progress , all delivered in tact .
M	although it was ok in the end , the order process did not engender confidence .
M	wouldn_'_t touch them with a bargepole .
F	the order was quite quick , which is a plus for you , but we are disappointed in the taste , which we have to live with for a whole year !
M	used after full knee replacement .
F	so pleased with my wedding_invites , they are better_than_expected , many_thanks .
F	it gives you total convenience to order as and when you need , their site is easy to navigate , and the delivery is excellent .
M	it seems that the money is managed by worldpay and may still be " stuck in the system ".
M	i sometimes end up with the liquid in my mouth , which is a bit_worrying seeing as the bottle of liquid says toxic on it .
M	do not buy from these_people the bed i bought was delivered damaged but so called customer service came up with small_print to deny any responsibility .
M	conversation went :
M	good price , great product
F	they said if i don_'_t want the product send them back .
F	i purchased 0 beer kits , a wine kit and a small barrel .
M	once tried never to be repeated dreadful quality .
M	the experience of the return_journey was excellent with good service , comfort and food .
F	how to explain it to someone_who has never tried the type i used to cook in russia ?
M	very quick and easy .
F	no phone_call with explanation just a letter .
F	since the delivery bit offers the option ' be patient ' i was shocked to discover that she only found the flowers late in the afternoon when a neighbour spotted them and knocked on the door to alert her to their delivery .
F	i cannot_fault your service at all you was brilliant .
M	just * brilliant *.
F	i would not_hesitate to use thy em again .
F	not only was my parcel delivered to the wrong_address but when opened it was all smashed up .
M	i followed the instructions provided and hey_presto it worked first time .
M	one was fine , but for the second fan , the box was torn and fell_apart when i lifted the fan out of the box .
F	no_problems_whatsoever .
M	this came about after they lost the emails and then try to blame it on me for deleting them .
M	apparently there was a new policy from upper management that very afternoon that insisted that replacements and refunds cannot happen until the full investigation has finished .
F	my phone has now been sent somewhere_else apparently and they can '_t get it back .
F	the information was ' found ' quickly and with an_apology that there was a very small price increase . the enquiry was at about 0pm but i received the goods by 00am the next_day !!
M	this was after i had arranged to have time away from work .
F	empty bottles
M	the guy i spoke to automatically argued with me for what reason i dont_know .
M	in the end we cut our losses , took these blinds off and purchased locally blinds at half the price which did exactly the job required .
M	well impressed . and that '_s rare !!!!
F	my last order was 0_days late and they didn_'_t respond to my emails asking why it was delayed - so much for their pledge to answer within 0 working day .
F	shelly baker
M	!
M	to be fair to the children , they were very well behaved .
M	), og_det derfor var min egen fejl det_var forbrugerklagenævnet heldig vis ikke enige i ( det tog godt_nok et halvt år ).
F	although my christmas box was delivered on time , the ricipients of the box received an_email from kiren_parcelhero copied to me the day after it had been collected from me asking them to call their local office to pay duty and tax .
F	last_year i joined a new company and i was ordering all supplies including stationairy .
M	he suggested that i return the car to the garage and he “ would look at it ”.
M	although they offered the best deal , it '_s not worth the hassle and stress if you need to contact them .
M	i will see how they will react after my review .
M	ordered a xerox printer and toner bundle .
M	been with vodafone for around 00 years .
M	the website does not make clear the toner is not genuine xerox toner .
F	a week_later i sent an_email to which they said they '_d chase it up .
M	the ship was on time and the crossing comfortable and the food ok .
M	!
M	i ordered a purple bouquet for my wife ( her_favourite colour ) which was supposed to have purple roses within it .
F	they shouldn_'_t offer these services .
M	well_done .
M	i sent some cds and books to ziffit but got an email_saying they had not received half of them .
M	a very very good service and i highly_recommend them .
M	when i arrived at early monday_morning , i was told that i would have to wait about an_hour before they would be able to look at my tyre_fitting as they had other customer cars to attend to first , even_though they were not waiting for them and had left their cars with them .
M	there web_site is so user_friendly , ordering is so easy first time and then just a one click order after that .
M	( go to el cristo beach , 00_mins drive away in estepona ).
M	on my left knee , the only compromise was to open it and put the top panel down between my leg and the side of the cockpit , so there was no point in having an opening kneeboard ( and it was still marginal in terms of clearance ).
F	excellent quick , reliable service but have been told that while the flowers are very pretty , the bunch is very small .
F	it wasn_'_t cheap so i won_'_t be treating_myself to another one .
F	i would use this site again and recommend to anyone .
F	we found out late that a very good friend had had her operation brought forward so i found this website for ireland the headline on the website said order by 0pm for same day delivery
M	i have the money and the terms are great .
F	wrong item sent and although they are sorting it out i '_m still_waiting for some items after nearly 0_weeks .
F	fortunately , after raising the issue with paypal the payment has_been refunded .
F	the customer service is abysmal - avoid at all costs .
M	perfect , just my sort of deal .
F	an_apology and saying you '_ll get back to someone , then getting back even if it is to say i know nothing yet , keeps your customers calm and happy .
M	fantastic savings , speedy delivery and wont be buying in the usual high end shops again , great site but nearly overlooked it because of name # cheap_smells , already_passed on details of online shop to family and friends .
F	the original ones we ordered arrived 0_days after the event .
M	do not_hesitate to use this company i will_definately be doing so soon .
F	.
M	needed to unlock an iphone 0 which i had bought but was locked to ee .
F	but they just printed and said its our fault and want to charge all over again , even when the evening_invites were not the colour we requested !
M	excellent price , cheaper_than any other supplier .
F	katy - incredibly helpful and understanding )!
M	!
M	had to go back online 0_weeks_later and order the second .
M	i will_definatley_use ellis_brigham again .
M	!
M	i will be using this service again .
F	if you order from somewhere that uses them , order with plenty of time to spare !
F	they kept me up to date with the process of equity_release and ensured that i was fully_aware of the commitment i was making .
F	the answer was that this was correct .
F	no reply from them yet but order actually arrived on 00th_april .
F	thank_you .
F	how wrong can you be or am i just very unlucky ?
F	cant_fault service or products !
M	i started a medicine chest for my grandaughter , who is about to set_up her first home , and ther is no substitue to having a good medicine cabinet , health is your most_important asset
F	considering mine was two months old , and i only got 0 pound .
M	a good product , easily fitted with good instructions .
M	the laptops i have had from dell have been good , but customer service is awful .
F	lots of styles and my collegues at work are extremely impressed by my choice and one girl will_definately be using the site when she needs to change her glasses .
M	the service from golfsupport was excellent once again , received goods within two_days from my order . will_definately_use again .
M	even that when they told me did not sound convincing , although i have got a tracking_number .
M	delivery was next_day and i was kept_informed_throughout .
M	they always knock the price down and take along time sending the money out .
M	i booked a collection via parcelhero .
F	pensions can be a mine_field for mere mortals but key_retirement_solutions made it easier to understand .
F	they were sent to a friend after the loss of her father , which made the circumstances even more distressing .
M	i ordered . black classic tubing and when it was late arriving i contacted the company who said classic takes longer it '_s says so on the site .
M	everything arrived fast in the post and i got verification the next_day that all was in order .
F	:-)
F	i upgraded the order in order for an very impressive lot of flowers to be delivered but instead i was disappointed .
M	the products are top quality and reasonably_priced , found on a simple to use website .
F	healthy_supplies seem to have a wide_range of products , things that i can '_t get in my local health_food store .
M	it was very easy to order the garage_door liftmaster 000 on line .
F	i was really questioning my decision to use them and really regret buying from them .
F	very disappointed .
F	hopefully wowcher will be able to resolve this and instigate procedures which will prevent other_companies from using the to scam people .
F	at which point he said that he didn_'_t know what i was talking_about as this was the first time i had spoken to him and hung_up on me !
F	the member of staff who i explained my situation to was incredibly rude , patronising , awkward and unsympathetic .
M	their back catalog is unsurpassed and transactions have always been fast and hassle_free .
F	this doesn_'_t seem long , but if you leave it 0 minutes and then try again , the location sensor seems to think you have travelled half a mile_away and it can take up to 00_minutes to get it to recognise your correct location .
F	wouldn_'_t buy from them again , dreading if anything_goes_wrong !!
F	when we finally arrived they presented us with a budget car .
M	i am an engineer so could work out for myself how it was mounted & configured but for someone less technical it would be difficult .
M	one cd ( out of about 00 ) was not recognised by the site .
M	i have of course received an estimated bill reducing my credit by £_00 for a month i have not lived in the house .
M	wary at fist but now i have no doubt in using this company again
F	i would recommend to others
M	!.
M	easy to assemble .
M	the price even includes a hard case and decent lens polishing cloth .
F	i understand that the bunches are dependant on supply in the florist but i couldn_'_t really see any resembelance .
M	ironically , that pair was bought online from a different company with my own , and the very same , pd i offered to glasses_direct .
M	wasted 0 days waiting on promise after promise they would do it .
F	would recommend them to friends and family .
F	i was unhappy with my existing cleaning company so decided to give mopp a try .
M	ordered a sofa last friday after they claim next_day delivery .
M	i didn_'_t fully understand at the time but i went for the pre_- paid fuel option which meant that i could return the car with an almost empty_tank .
M	the company should tell the right price from the beginning when we book .
F	needless to say , by the time i collected them they were all dead .
F	so here we are friday_afternoon and i ’_m still_waiting to see if my table is going to be picked_up in just0 days ’ time as i have to arrange somebody to sit at home all day whilst they come … and weather the new table will be delivered on the same day !.
F	initially we were told that we had to go through tripsta , then from tripsta we were told that for any change , there was going to be a £_00 . 00 penalty fee ( each ) even before checking new flights fares .
M	why did i want to send to non - home address .
M	great website , instant communication and fast delivery ; what more could you want ?
F	i was very pleasantly_surprised to see that not only do they accept damaged mobiles but they also offered me £_00 for it .
F	just joined recently and already saved £_00
M	waltons delivered as promised on saturday , and we got round to putting it together sunday .
F	c fry
M	had no_problems , flight times good , villa good but starting to need a lick of paint but we had a good time .
M	on the viagogo website it only said that my ticket purchases were " pending confirmation ".
F	prompt delivery but we were ten envelopes short with the invites and as we needed to send out asap we had to go out and buy some , which was a disappointment .
F	ordered a new_washing_machine - good price and excellent communication about delivery .
M	on receiving my memory_upgrade one of the modules failed to work .
F	disappointed sadly , rather a shame .
F	really good , competitive_prices , loads of choice and speedy delivery !
F	if i am really in trouble with the other half i will use again for the speed , but if it was for a special_occasion i would look elsewhere .
M	thye no_longer offer a telephone complaints line .
M	you might be laughing to yourselves when you see the company profits .
F	if , however , she did not return in time i would be contacted by camilla after 0am this morning .
F	mail order trees delivered the trees we ordered on the day we requested , which was both amazing and marvellous !
M	for me , frustratingly slow , poor service so ultimately poor value .
M	avoid !
F	i was very disappointed with the flowers i ordered for my stepdaughters birthday , i expected a big bouquet and it turned_out to be just a very small one , not like it was on the picture .
M	. reliable delivery but records with frayed spines are disappointing
F	therefore it was like eating a cork place mat .
F	i emailed xdp at 00 . 00am asking them to confirm the mattress was being delivered on the 0th .
F	keep it up !!
M	superb service !!!
M	very easy to navigate through the booking process .
F	i requested in the order to ' leave them on the door_step ', you left them with a neighbour .
M	emails from happy_puzzle kept me informed all the way .
M	i '_m sorry to have to write this review , as i was nothing but glowing 0st time around .
F	!
F	others allow this .
F	this is the second order in 0_weeks that has left me in a pickle first my red dress for the office xmas party didn_'_t arrive on time and now i '_m told the 00 items i have ordered for xmas_presents will not probably arrive until the 00th of december .
M	lost my glasses in the post and we ' re hard to get answers from .
F	due to sortage of time i could not return them which i probably would have done .
F	i contacted feedem ( within the 0_months my consumer_rights allow ) and told them i had cleared the food out as it was a h_& s issue in my house ( as i am legally allowed to ) but sent photographic_evidence of the mould .
M	the website is user_friendly .
M	howveer the really funny part is that they then delivered the thing a few_days_later but seemed totally_unaware of until i asked them why they had done that .
M	great , i '_ll work my day around that .
M	at all times i was in no doubt of the status of my repair which was done so well there was no sign of damage at all .
M	wouldn_'_t let_me withdraw the 00p .
F	i could have flown myself to holland and picked the tickets up for the cost they charged !
M	heard_nothing so assumed order was okay .
F	i basically paid over_$_000 for a vase and 0 bunches of fressia " s . i called and spoke to someone_who said they would follow_up and get back to me .
F	would definitely use dealchecker again & again .
M	i feel very sorry for those who have been fleeced by this bunch of wa # k # rs .
M	nothing was to much of a problem and went_smoothly .
F	wanted to clear junk .
M	therefore the company is tying to offer a good service .
M	and , after the order , responded instantly to a followup question .
F	their call_centres are abroad and therefore explaining things is never easy , simply because the nuances of the problems are missed .
F	did a trial run 0st time and couldnt_believe_how good the service was .
M	now after 0 days shy of a whole month waiting for my monitor it has arrived , soaking_wet and damaged
F	they are totally indifferent to their customers .
F	?
M	i booked an oil and filter_change on - line and got a booking slot for some 0 days_later , had to pay in advance for some reason , and within 0 hour was called by custmer service who said that the branch_manager did not have any of that oil in stock !
F	( theobromine is toxic for dogs - there is no safe level , it is a poison for dogs ). i filled in contact forms on their site 0 times , no response .
M	the ordering_process is easy and quick .
F	i book with them on a monthly_basis , and they would definitely have made more money by refunding the £ 0 . 00 they stole from me than losing my custom .
M	at 00 : 00 the next_morning dpd delivered the goods , all were excellent and have reassured me with being_able to defend my property from flooding .
F	brilliant choice of high_quality chocolate on an easy to use site .
F	she '_s so pleased .
M	first purchase was delivered on a pallet no_problems
F	have used the website a couple of times , and products have always been good , brill prices in the sales , and quick delivery .
M	he was very rude when i said i ' d sign once i ' d seen the goods .
F	easy to register , good variety then completes with super speedy delivery !
M	good work but for me the two points are what let things down a little .
F	stopped my tb '_s joints clicking and certainly allowed her to move more freely .
F	high_quality goods arrived in perfect_condition at the time specified .
M	0 working_days_later , no parcel .
M	), they then changed the courier to tnt as they said they were more reliable than city_link ????
M	order roses for my girlfriend for our 0year and 0months while on tour when they got to her they were dieing
F	i received email responses saying the courier had delivered and when i requested details of the recipient they did not respond .
F	i ordered some birkenstocks but it wasnt mentioned anywhere on the page that they wrre slimfit .
M	bad_experience with this one , avoid
F	their prices are much more_expensive than the likes of yours clothing which has always had great customer service .
M	i would highly_recommend as service excellent and delivered next_day at no extra_cost .
M	the company made some excuse that they cant send the cheques all out at once , sounds_like a cashflow problem to me .
F	although the tracking shows it '_s still in hong_kong .
F	i ordered 0 white bar_stools .
F	everything was fast and communicated well .
F	after_reading all the great reviews about menapol_plus i was hoping for great things !!!
M	i ordered some clothes of the website & they were delivered within 00_hours .
F	this isn_'_t a corporate bank or law firm - flowers are a personal , human thing .
M	!
F	i sent all the info again , but our weekend was ruined .
F	unfortunately , the item i ordered appeared quite different ( colour - wise ) to online pic , so i had to return ( and pay returns charge )
F	the website is easy to use with good descriptions .
F	they have now had my watch for 0_weeks without_any sign of either the repair or a replacement .
M	really not good service , so i dred to think what would happen if you had a complex problem with your rental .
M	what an underhand devious money making scam !
M	there are many other_sites and shops that you can go to , avoid these like the plague .
F	i told her off really - but i shouldn_'_t have had to .
F	if it wasn_'_t for chloe at their customer_services i would have given a much_lower rating .
F	i needed to order a load of t - shirts for a hen_do .
M	i was very pleased with the delivery service for the product i ordered .
M	bra telefonsupport och_snabba leveranser , men hemsidan är buggig vilket gör det svårt att_beställa .
M	this is because we live in the scottish_highlands , part of the uk_mainland .
M	viagogo have been silent despite several emails and a poor response to their customer survey .
M	the item is faulty ?
M	all i all i recommend sds heartily .
M	orbitremit makes it easy to repay your student_loan when living_abroad .
F	my phone didn_'_t have the that button and says " well it wouldn_'_t work without that button !"
F	always had very positive shopping_experiences and will be continuing to use and recommend to others .
M	some of the prices charged are really extortionate
M	tried to track today , but no information , so rang bdw only to be told that one of the products that i had ordered ( one they had specifically emailed me about to tell me it was back in stock ), had not come into stock until friday at 0 . 00 pm meaning that my order was not dispatched at all .
F	and frankly all i want right now is my money !
M	farcical do not use .
F	i am kind of happy with the product but very disappointed with the colours .
M	meaning not sure if after 00_hrs i would still be able to purchase .
M	product ordered and not received when queried stated they had not received prescription which they then had , product then delivered quickly so received in the nick of time !
M	all in a great deal and prompt service from the company .
F	i ll never use them again !
M	thanks boiler_juice for yet another " tank - up " taking the worry of winter heating from me with a rapid organisation of oil from a supplier who delivered before your suggested date .
F	the florist who delivered was the one they had used for their daughters ' weddings and the flowers are beautiful .
F	i have just received my lenses , only a couple of days after ordering them .
F	good customer_care and high_quality service
F	living in the channel_isles it '_s hard enough trying to buy the exact thing your looking and you have to buy online only to be disheartened when the company do not deliver to the channel_islands !
M	0_star still_awaiting 0 item told out of stock on invoice heard_nothing since almost 00 days since order not very impressed
M	i ordered a hoodie and they sent me the wrong_size 0 times in a row after me sending it back so annoying .
F	disappointing first experience , despite_being suggested by my sister , who have used this company on my occasions .
M	as my father in law would say - incompetence .
F	so after 00_minutes of being on hold waiting to talk to a human they still could '_t tell me where my order is !!!!
M	it looks_like it was done before posting , but i cant be sure .
M	and the order arrived next_day .
F	i am a regular customer of the bead_shop and find them fast and efficient .
M	i requested the refund , which has not yet been made .
M	no idea who it was , did a quick google and discovered it was these_people .
F	if it is , i click their link and hey_presto , the items are still in the basket and i just have to pay .
F	luckily there was fabric to loosen the trouser and i have an amazing tailor who charged me double the prize of the purchase to alterate all 0 items .
M	i would not recommend this type of car_hire .
M	people on o0 , vodaphone and indeed 0 seem to have no trouble with the network_coverage but t - mobile seems to constantly struggle .
M	very good service .
F	let them even try !
M	drive on drive off through customs enjoy the break , hassle_free ferry_crossings .
M	i would heartily_recommend flightstore to anybody .
F	after_spending 00_minutes on the phone to multiple advisors and being hung_up on twice !!
F	they eventually refunded 00p , as this was the price of the rub minus 00_%_off , and refused to acknowledge my complaints about their cs .
F	buying the flowers on line was very straight_forward , delivery was free and prompt ( the next_day ) plenty of offers and discounts on the site .
M	always had good service in the past , but delivery company said they could not find our house this time , although we have had deliveries made by many companies in the past without issue .
M	my photobooks are always of a high_standard with prompt delivery and usually under some sort of offer so at a good price .
M	but your staff where brilliant .
M	i found the item i required and managed to get it ordered up without_any_problems .
F	great value and service .
M	small and compact but does everything you need .
F	they delivered a double .
M	when they fail at the first stage which is very simple they will fail on other services too for sure .
M	i purchased the single gate opener for my farm gate .
F	i placed my first order with beautybay and was really impressed with the price and speedy delivery .
F	very slow delivery , ordered perfume and still_haven_'_t received it after 00 days
M	at_least i know my poor experience wasn_'_t isolated , although i do feel for anyone unlucky_enough to have suffered at the hands of futeko '_s petulant customer service .
F	it was sent in good time but delivered without signature to a different street .
M	they won_’_t survive for a day without the support of royal_mail given the service they provide and the fee they charge .
F	booked a ' conspiracy theory tour , was told to book it through the website but you can '_t book through the website and there is no e_- mail address or phone number for contact .
M	would order from them again .
M	quick processing and dispatch of the order and a speedy delivery .
M	thats when it all went wrong , buggy and high chair quick to arrive , but much needed raincover for our phil and ted '_s sport never arrived .
F	i am disabled and don_'_t live_near any shops so it is invaluable to me not to have to bother other people to shop for me .
F	i have shopped in hmv a lot over the years and prefer spending my money instore rather_than online .
F	excellent service with free next_day delivery !!
M	very poor service .
M	the online booking is quick and easy with a great tyre selector feature using your car '_s reg .
F	i run two nationwide companies so i know what good customer service is .
F	thank_heavens for chemist_direct , ordering was easy and delivery fast .
F	website easy to use , delivery as stated , product quality
F	the emails advised that i should contact ubs urgently and that if the third and final delivery failed my tickets would be destroyed .
M	speedy delivery and prompt service , exactly_what they were described as
F	i agreed to the brown .
F	the blinds fit windows just as i measured .
F	on the morning of the flight we followed these but could not find the carpark , and had to park elsewhere as we were running out of time .
M	i order an ericsson t00 which was in stock however after waiting sometime to see why my order was not on its way i contacted the company .
F	unable to get refund direct from car_park as had used_fhr .
F	however , it all ended well as far as the theatre was concerned .
F	i tried_calling but was 00th in a queue so i made decision to take a couple of hours off work to take the item back to have the tag removed .
F	the figures given by the salesman and later by the surveyor did not match up and i strongly feel that the paperwork should be simplified in order that the customer can understand .
M	also if your paying on bnpl on credit terms make_sure its paid off before you have to start paying for it . you '_ll pay almost double if not more in some cases .
F	i ordered the same product from another company on the wednesday and it was delivered on the saturday which is the service i expect .
F	i did as instructions said and checked the list to find out that a few pieces were missing , so phoned mattress next_day who were very helpful but said that parts have to come from manufacturers and im still_waiting , almost a week_later .
F	they sent us statistics regularly .
F	the service was good and the flowers were delivered on time , so if you do not mind alternations this service is for you .
F	firstly i '_m told i need to make a claim from the po when it was their postage_label i used then i '_m told that i should take it up with my credit_card company !!!!!
F	what do i do now .
M	there were no queries or changes to the price quoted .
F	terrible service & i feel ripped_off !
M	don_'_t force people away because of this .
M	after 0 attempts to get an answer from packard_bell , they sent a message tellung me that they don_'_t have documentation for the monitor and , that i should take it to a local technician !
M	it is very relaxed though and much_better_than in england .
F	all the free products made it that more enjoyable and allows me to try things i would have never thought of trying .
M	no_fuss .
M	this product was recommended by a joiner and for good reason .
M	would strongly_recommend to others if you wear / use contact_lenses .
F	i recommend blackcircle they are so easy to order and very fast delivery no prblems at all
M	i even knew the delivery time within a one - hour range .
M	it arrived on thursday - which is still good , but it makes a mockery of " next_day delivery "
M	we do not always save receipts so cannot claim on these .
F	what an odd company i would not suggest anybody no matter_how utterly desperate you truly are and believe me i too was desperate but believe me i '_m not that desperate to be mucked about by a company who feed of the poorer in our society to line there own already fat pockets .
M	we said we would like them to actually deliver what we ordered and she very rudely_told us it would be with us in 00_minutes .
M	kept_informed of order and progress .
M	serenataflowers did a great job , flower are lovely and the girl i sent them too really really loves them , however her special supprise was ruined when i was forced to phone her before they eventually arrived to be on the lookout for a package .
F	blind perfect and good quality .
F	i placed my order without a problem .
M	replacements are , i '_m told , on the way and should be here in 00_hours time .
M	once a shining_example of a british broadband_provider who worked hard to stand out from the big_players by providing a premium but reliable internet service , icuk is now nothing more than an overpriced minnow .
M	case closed , and thanks to nottingham_drum and guitar .
M	could not polish it out and case was too big for the hassle of returning , so just turned it around so barely_noticeable .
F	when do i pay ?
F	throughly delighted with the complete service .
F	i ordered another kitchen which was more_expensive so had to pay the difference but luckily this was delivered the day before our trip .
M	plumbnation failed to deliver on two occasions , and never bothered to even tell me they would not be coming so i have wasted two_days waiting in for nothing .
M	easy to get a quote .
M	0_star service
M	any daft questions i had were answered openly and honestly and i felt comfotable asking for their help .
M	on their website it states i have a direct_debit set_up .
F	after trying , 0 crank rotary_washing lines from argos , which all proved to be faulty , i came_across the home_laundry company on the internet .
F	the costume is poorly made for regular use and after inially being really happy with the website , the process , delivery and price i '_m now disappointed the costume is falling_apart .
M	it was the total_opposite with the pick_up , i was 00_minutes early and called the contact number and informed them and somehow he booked another cab ?
M	a great let_down to another wise great experience .
F	disgraceful and totally_unacceptable .
M	because that claim was laughable i got some here .
M	usually very happy with your photo_books but this time although it was placed in an envelope with do not bend written on it , the envelope was bent when it reached us & the corner of the book ( cover & 00 pages was bent !)
M	so if you are not in a hurry the prices seem to be ok and service in general is good .
M	may be that is because i am from nl , where flowers are way cheaper .
M	i had no problem with them , the prices were low and i got them within a few_days .
M	customer_services were useless and completely unable to help in any way whatsoever . was it a good deal . who_knows .
M	as a result , my order is irrelevant , and that '_s £ 0 wasted .
M	very good product , with very fast delivery .
M	the recent ( not that recent ) feature update that allows anyone to sell on amazon also unnerves me a little_bit .
M	always had no trouble and quick deliveries .
F	i '_d definitely recommend them .
M	now , i '_m off to buy a uk dc adapter .
M	it took 0 days , and two nagging emails from me to acknowledge the playbook had even arrived .
F	very happy with service from kiddies_kingdom , quick and easy web_page , order delivered as promised and definatley use agian
M	i ordered a product from this site , which was a hamster cage .
M	i was looking for some jewellery findings and found them in the bead_shop .
F	i have to call the sender .
F	i would recommend watersports_warehouse to anyone .
M	however , i had asked the delivery driver to be patient when delivering as my father is hard of hearing and my mother slow due to a recent hip operation .
M	i '_m not happy paying £_00 for this service , so i enquired_about reducing it for this month .
M	payment_methods very limited too , but delivery fast and reliable
F	really great service at a really great price .
F	i looked on the internet for a local_florist to her .
M	quality is great and delivery fast too .
F	and by liking them on facebook i received a further £ 0 off !
F	these people are impossible to reach on the phone , and calling an 0000 number from a mobile and holding on for 00 - 00 minute stretches at a time costs a fortune !
F	i think my sister was happier with the gesture father than the actual flowers .
F	just checked my emails and have to say , have had a response . timed at 0 . 00pm today . they say my additional postage charge has_been refunded and blamed the courier company for taking it to the wrong depot . satisfied , however would only increase to 0_star , due to the lack of information , and the time taken to respond to my emails !
F	found the gentleman that felt with my claim .
M	as i didn_'_t need them immediately chose free p_&_p but they arrived very quickly .
M	it did not arrive .
M	i consider everything about your company including your web_site , sales and delivery staff to be outstanding , all are true_professionals .
F	but very disappointed as i was about to buy the boots at the reduce price of £_00 ( or_thereabouts ) but was going on hols so thought it best to order on my return so they weren_'_t sitting_around .
F	my partner and i never give out our numbers ( only friends and family ) we never fill in forms and leave our number on there .
M	i told_him to forget booking me back in and that i would just keep the specs and maybe take them out of the box in 0 - 0 years time when maybe then , my eyes might be slightly worse .
M	i sent my iphone_0s in for a screen repair which they received on the 0th_november .
F	i needed a satnav in a hurry for my son to return to germany on his recently_purchased motorbike .
M	however , 0 days_later i received an email_saying that the fridge i had ordered was no_longer being manufactured and would i like an_alternative .
F	i told sunny rentals and they got back to me quickly .
M	i '_ve ordered a few_times from them now and will_continue to do so .
M	not the prettiest thing to have under a settee in a living_room but they have lifted the furniture safely making it much more comfortable to use without spending a fortune .
M	on thurs .
M	unnecessary card if you ask .
M	kind_regards
F	thank_you thank_you
F	the coffees ordered arrived so quickly & well_packaged .
M	he also advised that he will be taking - up the delivery delay with fed_ex .
M	the parcel arrived extreemly quickly and the invoice i received even gives me 0 % of my next and any future_purchases .
M	this is when we found all the crap spread over the rest of the house along with mastic spread all over the frames and window revels .
F	thank_you
M	plus , i have sky , which has better channels for the money .
M	i made an appointment for friday am which was confirmed online .
M	great site , easy to use and incredibly quick delivery .
F	i '_ve always been scandalised by vet '_s prices and was so pleased to be recommended to m by a friend .
M	great service was willing to help gave_me all the answers i needed .
M	before i installed cctv , i had to send proof of my signature to ebuyer because i had apparently signed for an item when i was 00 miles_away .
M	i am a frequent internet shopper and the best traders that i buy from , ensure that their goods arrive within 00 - 00_hours , which meant wednesday at the latest .
M	great service , good price and prompt delivery .
F	yesterday , as usual , i went to lunch at her house and i was totally unhappy with the flowers she had received .
F	i would strongly_recommend their services to anyone , in fact , i have , many of my friends and family now use the service .
M	:-)
F	he explained to me that the order wouldn_'_t be despatched until monday so he changed the order so it would be delivered on the monday .
M	appalling fulfilment ruins this site and i potential_customers not to use it unless you want to wait weeks for your order to arrive and be fobbed_off endlessly by their ' customer service ' team telling you that " it will be there tomorrow ".
M	i have made several phone_calls different times of the day & all you get is a answer machine . i have sent several emails no reply its a complete_joke .
F	staff not helpful and looked very confused and flustered ( disorganised ).
M	the flowers were beautiful - possibly the best i have bought my wife - however they arrived in a soggy box as the water had somehow leaked in transit . so much so that the accompanying card was barely readable .
F	i very very rarely have anything to complain_about but have to warn_people before using approved , i started off as an_avid fan , filling my cupboards for incredibly low costs .
M	great smooth service .
M	when i finally received this there was a lose screw rattling_around in the tower which unfortunately i cannot get to , pretty shoddy considering i paid over £ 0000 for this item , where is the qc checks apple ?
F	one email will tell me that a product is no_longer available and then another a few_days_later will advise me on a delay of the product saying it will be sent when available .
M	fantastic commucation from placing my order right up to delivery .
F	i was assured it would definitely arrive the following_day without even checking with the parcelforce .
M	on the ticket are your details , no explanation of this is given when you book , annd it would help if they just said , take the ticket and as you '_ve already pre_paid just put it in the machine when you leave .
M	flowers arrived on time , but the roses were wilted and has brown marks all over them .
M	for the price paid i think this was poor .
M	i have written again to ask them to review the way this has_been dealt_with and am awaiting hopefully a more reasonable response to the error .
F	i ordered flowers for my grandma after finding a deal on amazon .
M	superb level of service which inspires_confidence to use them again .
F	you don_'_t have to think about food and what to eat , it '_s all there for you .
F	pre_- pay online , so no_faffing_about with payments etc .
M	i am still_awaiting delivery of 0 x_000ml blue grass perfume and this was supposedly consigned almost two_weeks_ago .
F	finding thinks , pix easily
F	0 week_later i received another email that in no way answered my complaint .
F	however , i cannot consider spending a lot of money online unless i am sure of the quality and features of what i '_m looking at .
F	bought the tag carrera 0000 from iconic_watches who were selling it at the most competitive price .
M	waited in all day for the 0nd time to then receive a call saying problem with table .
F	i just wasn_'_t in a rush so free_postage would have been fine .
F	a couple of days_later i was amazed to be told the full £_00 . 00 would be paid into my paypal_account , even after the laptop had been inspected .
F	i '_ve_used ' cheaper ' photo - books before but , wanting to support jessop / new company , decided to give them my business .
F	i then contacted them to ask whether holdup would go on ad infinitum .
M	trustpilot is a flawed system .
F	i vented my disappointment and thoughts about this transaction to the staff who had no opportunity to make this situation any better - i think i was swindled .
F	great brands , great choice , great delivery service .
F	i recent ordered two_pairs of glasses .
F	i would recommend using them .
M	all my other_suppliers come up with weekly emailed offers ( gearboxes / centre cases / multipoint locks / friction hinges etc_.)
F	one of the drawers on the 0 drawer_chest sticks and makes a clicking noise when you open it but quite honestly the thought of packaging it all up again and returning it fills me with horror so i '_ll live with it .
F	many_thanks .
F	having found the same product on ebay i ordered from pdol0000 but did not realise they are the same company and same thing happened only it took them four days to issue a refund through paypal which is now being held (£_00 ) and won_'_t be available to me until goodness_knows when .
F	i ordered a stag and doe statue for my mum christmas early_december and it did not arrive until the thurs 0th of feb .
M	thank_you cash_generator for your terrible service and causing my brother to go without a birthday_present .
F	looking_forward to hearing how my family liked their flowers .
M	next_day i get a text saying delivery refused by addressee .
M	that was 00 days ago and nothing more from debenhams !
F	our bathroom work was put on hold for 0_days waiting for it .
M	they also attempted to renege on the agreement to accept the product was defective .
M	i wont buy from anywhere_else ever again
M	all i can say is amazing !
M	changed the way i feel about the company plus i have now lost a valuable client because of all this .
F	i usually do well when ordering from fragrance_direct but this time i think folk '_s minds must have been wandering .
F	postscript : i have just taken the time to read through the various complaints concerning this company , in the main its lack of customer service , i have gone quite a way back . time and again the replies that all these people who have left a review have received from trueshopping is the same it is clearly a bog_standard copy / paste type of reply : and it reads :
F	also found the £ 0 fee on top of each mug for the transfer to be a hidden cost as this was not made clear until payment
F	would definitely use again and save a fortune :)
F	when i had finished completing order i pressed the button and the order appeared to go through twice .
F	they told me the item was not in stock and they were waiting for delivery from nespresso .
F	nothing turned_up .
F	everything was organised , even the appointment for the photographer to come and take my pictures .
M	if you don_'_t then the ' buyer ' needs some people skills , urgently .
F	i have tried_calling the number provided for the past 0_days where all i get is an engaged_tone , and i have emailed 0 times without getting a response !
F	yes , it was an arrangement of fresh flowers and was delivered on time , but it was not what i ordered !
M	easy to book with , but when we had problems it was difficult to get hold of you , all we got was a lot of auto emails , would of been nice for you to call me and talk to a person .
F	this was my first_impression of your company and ordered flowers for my mother in law who had just lost her mother and on her first day back at work i sent her these to tell her i was thinking of her !
M	purchased a vehicle workshop_manual online download .
F	i wanted to give this company no stars , but it turns_out i can '_t submit this without giving it one .
F	disgusting - do not use serenata !
F	today i found out the real reason is ups hadn_'_t even been booked as the package wasn_'_t scanned .
M	being a grandad makes easy use and good service essential .
F	it was entirely my choice .
M	transfer , accommodation and shooting range were all cool but our guide tried to take us to the most expensive bars so we did our own thing
M	the food arrived in a timely_manner but i wanted to change my order before it had been dispatched and this was not possible .
F	ang i wouldn_'_t recommend your services either .
M	once installed it works well and sucks in food steam / smoke from the cooker below , blowing out non - smelly air
F	was getting desperate as could not find sr_toothpaste anywhere and i have been using it since i was a child ( now 00 ).
M	the refund was prompt and also refunded the £ 0 . 00 delivery charge as well , good communication with golbase
F	saturday went and i sent 0 emails chasing them up with no reply , sunday came and went and another 0 emails with no reply !!
F	unsurprisingly i have still not had a response .
M	my client was thrilled and i was very pleased to have been able to give them a personal thank_you .
F	sent flowers to my parents as a thank_you .
M	their apr is high , the interest is calulated to leave you paying more interest than your payments unless you pay in full as soon as the bill comes .
M	i was very pleased with the service and price i received from paperstone .
F	on the other ; their customer service was the worst i have experienced in a long time .
M	i do not know why they put mats in every seating position , it clearly_shows abuse of my vehicle .
M	when i explained i wanted to speak with someone about broadband and phone , they put me through and once i explained i wasn_'_t paying their charge and had them pinned against a wall , they actually hung_up on me ( and i was being polite !
F	still_waiting for dvd to arrive , 0_days now .
F	so they send out a faulty item and we have to pay the consequences . to make_matters worse they didn_'_t care less it was my sons_birthday_present . what theyre trying to do is fix the faulty imported bike and send it me back .
F	i '_ve been using the bead_shop for years_now and i can_honestly_say that i '_ve never been disappointed .
F	clearly seraphine is not to the same beast and perhaps it '_s not fair on me to compare .
F	we want to buy some fags but my mate has no i '_d at all and they refused to serve us .
F	ordered a light and a few hours_later the same product came on sale yet they cudnt say when i was ordering this
F	my name was spelt wrong on the cheque so had to he sent back therefore delaying cashing of the cheque
M	nobody had the decentcy to contact me to update me of the situation .
M	buying from ' retention ' is deemed to be online and nothing to do with o0 retail_shops .
M	i have contacted them on a number of occasions and only got a standard reply back , my husband rang them and asked for the money to be refunded , which they did not do ????!!!!
M	- changing details an asking for re - quotes was a pain , shouldn_'_t this be automatic ?
M	unable to give proper opinion until flowers are delivered
M	better that if you can .
F	i was quite disappointed when i received the package as some of my orders were missing and others had been replaced by some products i didn_'_t want and didn_'_t particularly_liked .
M	i was very happy with my costumes timely arrival .
F	thank_you
F	there are almost always substitutes for items i have ordered and they are sometimes totally different from my original choice .
F	bought my new bedroom_furniture and was very impressed by the very helpful sales people and speedy delivery , just 0_days after ordering .
M	flowers are stunning but a bit disappointed that they are delivered in a box and not by hand courier as expected / suggested on delivery email .
F	they make money from me phoning them as they insist on using a chargeable number , unles you subscribe to the sky phone service , then they keep you waiting for 00_mins before someone tells you to ring a different number or makes you reboot the box which ive already done .
M	i could have bought something very similar for a fraction of the price .
M	placed the order and it was delivered on time just as expected .
F	i then had to regenerate the text i wanted which always started as the default for the invitation i was interested in .
F	on the plus_side , my friend said the flowers were beautiful and really appreciated them .
F	i reordered bigger jacket size and returned small one separately paying twice to reduce turnaround time but then had to pay to send the first one back - sort of a manual exchange .
M	overall i '_m really pleased , but it was inconvenient at the time .
M	their website says they are in stock and i queried this with them but apparently the website always says they are in stock , its only once you have paid for the glasses that they tell you this and you have to wait .
M	a request for fairness might also be better_than a straight threat in this regard although maybe there have been a lot of people violating the exposure rule in an attempt to save what is really a reasonable fee .
M	- 0 man delivery team who waited whilst i checked the unit over
F	very pleased with my new house number .
M	my main_concern at that point was that if i started having side - effects in the following two months leading up to her surgery , would we still be able to cancel and get this money back ?
M	read the reviews and stay clear .
M	for instance with a restaurant review , look for references to use by locals ……. if they are using the place for meeting and eating , then they are probably the best recommendation you could get .
M	might be more tactful to send a feedback request only after the item has_been delivered .
F	the cover was immediately fixed from when i needed it .
M	highly_recommended .
F	made ordering what we wanted so easy and the next_day delivery option really suited our needs .
F	i '_ve never had any_problems with cult_pens .
M	ivor
F	can not reach them by e : mail , get no response on live_chat .
M	could not be sure of some slight_scratches to the rear_bumper and when asked why they hadn_'_t re fitted the number_plate got no reply ???
F	waiting on refund for a suit which cost £_000 .
F	we werent very happy with the flight , is a good price at the beginning but then it comes all the extras .
M	i placed 0 separate_orders recently with 0 different experiences .
M	the items turned_up exactly when they said , it made my life easy as i didn_'_t have to stay in all day just in case .
M	awesome service and quick .
M	website was user_friendly , order received quicker_than_expected and the product was priced competitvely
F	ordered the peace bouquet and had them sent to my mother as a gift as i could not travel to her_birthday .
M	and this is , sadly , where it goes_wrong .
F	i love browsing the forums as well as using the client .
F	booked an express delivery service to greece .
M	also when you buy from them you can rest_assured as all the watches are genuine and you have peace of mind .
M	deal with this company at your_peril .
F	lisa
F	the second time i tried to order something i was told that my email address & password didn_'_t exist so i set_up another account .
F	the breakfasts were lovely and the staff we met were pleasant .
F	that '_ll be a no .
F	turns_out this was also completely false .
F	disappointing that this is not taken into account .
M	i have been a loyal_customer with argos for over 00 years , and have never had any_problems with the products or prices that they offer .
F	do not use this company .
F	they look good and fit well but i have , as yet , not had a chance to try them in water .
F	when i ordered the goods i was told a 0 - 0 day delivery so considering i ordered the goods on a sunday i was expecting the goods to arrive friday at the latest .
F	they are fraudulent , and who_knows_how much they managed to make from innocent buyers over their period of operation .
F	when i telephoned the company direct for advise i did not find the staff that helpful almost made me feel as if was asking a daft question .
F	in december_0000 we bought 0 tickets from viagogo for the monty python show ,( £_000 tickets cost us nearly_£_000 . 00 ) tickets arrived in january_0000 .
M	they text me when they had been dispatched and delivered .
F	upon phoning customer_services they confirmed a medium had been sent but no apology given !
F	the damn taps arrived at 0 :_00am this morning , and i have handed them straight back to the driver to be returned to this trueshopping !!
F	however , the lady_who called to verify my details was extremely difficult to understand .
M	this was a great service that i received .
F	no_problems
F	i will never buy tickets from them again and wouldn_'_t recommend you do .
F	great and speedy delivery , one item small finger vibrator did not work , enjoyed the experience without the vibration but still think it could of been better with .
F	well , no better_than before it went in ( it was working before , i just wanted a service on it as it had been 0 years ).
M	i call this super service , but phone contact not great .
F	now dealt_with and a second print is apparently on its way .
M	had my racket 0 days after order , with emails to me about every_stage of the process .
F	very happy with the initial order process .
M	it didn_'_t really help me out though .
M	following another couple of weeks and another unanswered email , i was told in a second call that the reason i still had no product was that the third_party supplier had failed to respond ( could they not have tried a different one ?)
M	the hardwood companion chair was delivered in very good time with regular_updates by email if delivery was on track .
F	however i did provide a contact telephone_number which was switched on and with me the entire day .
M	i am very annoyed because a week after purchase the price was dropped by aprox
M	while , thankfully , the data issues don_'_t affect me too often , since i '_m usually at a location where i can get excellent wi_-_fi , what has affected me and left me irate is their customer service .
F	i am delighted with the service and product and would certainly order from this company again .
F	i had to send 0 emails on 0 consecutive_days , 00 days after_placing my order .
M	the advisor on the phone told her " we know there is a problem , just give it a few minutes and try again ."
F	in short ," good service but extremely slow ".
F	lots of niggly points but overall it was just a bit_disappointing for a villaplus villa .
F	sent my sons sony_ericsson after been quoted £_000 . 00 .
F	i probably wasted that having the activate the argos_card by ringing the 0000 number .
M	parcel delivered after 0pm ( had to go out at 0pm ) call couriers an they have advised that cannot collect parcel so wanted to charge for redelivery .
M	worked out cheaper_than competitors even after discounts on other_sites had been applied .
M	i am out tomorrow so who_knows what will happen .
F	i got £_00 for a phone that was just sat in drawer !!
F	how can that be . why can '_t a parcel be traced . was it delivered , or not .
F	the website was easy to navigate and select product ; ordering was straight_forward , was particularly impressed that i could order from canada at 0 . 00pm for next_day delivery in the uk !
M	i tried to take_advantage of the 00_%_discount offer for a return crossing dover to calais only to discover that the price quoted was the same as dfds was quoting on its own website anyway .
F	purchased online .
M	very misled by the picture that showed them to be far more than they were .
F	if you need a printer , i recommend printerland .
F	not a quick and easy job , as i had to trawl_through pages of vests , then go through the pages of shorts .
F	i feel the website needs updating , to make it faster ( fewer clicks ) to order a repeat_prescription , once ordered the email_confirmation you receive doesn_'_t contain any details apart_from an order number .
M	i paid extra to receive my shoes in 0 days .
F	i will be using this site again .
M	none of these worked at all .
M	good delivery and easy to install
F	the site offers a vast_range of costumes to choose from , however larger_sizes ( 00 plus ) are limited .
F	mainy when they ppost things to you0 they take no responyilty for there postal couriers .
F	i was pleased with the key ring i ordered with a photo of a light_coloured dog .
F	this is not what the web_site says and is a matter for trading_standards to now sort_out .
F	this means i have to research to get the details .
F	however what all 0 qualified employees failed to notice was that there was a nut stuck in the key already .
F	tis true ; o_)
M	i do recommend them for their customer service .
F	i hope i don_'_t have the need to contact pc_specialist with problems in the future , but if i do , i am confident that the firm will do all they can to help .
F	i odered this strap on friday_afternoon and received it in the post on saturday !
F	following posting this ad , the ball started rolling !
M	thank_you for such prompt and professional and discreet service .
F	not any more , the fridge_freezer was put in the middle of the kitchen_floor and i was left to deal with it .
F	easy website .
F	when they '_d taken the order originally they hadn_'_t written down the size and instead of phoning to ask they just guessed !
M	!
F	a very fast delivery and not ripped_off on the postage_costs .
F	they never actually answer_questions in emails or on the phone .
M	when the order arrived it was wrapped beautifully and i was extremely happy with the service provided and quality of the product !
M	the truth was in your " small_print " as was pointed_out to me .
M	is repaired new as good as perfect new and worth as much is the big question and will the repairs last ?
F	now expected at the end of january !
F	my daughter always orders the weekly_shop on line and we normally have it delivered between_0am and 0am on a saturday .
F	i then get a phone_call from my mum saying that the flowers had been dumped on the doorstep or next door and had been sitting_outside in the rain for two_days .
M	this was an one - time deal and they did say they would have replaced the wheel if they had stock .
F	this tap caught my eye right away and i was not disappointed ?
M	sent 0 phones and only got paid for 0 but issue was quickly resolved when i called to complain
M	t allison
M	what else can i say very quick very good great
M	i had never purchased a ramp for my mobility_scooter but
F	we ordered a barbecue over the weekend and paid_extra to nominate wednesday as a delivery day .
M	when i called customer_services they explained that there had been a warehouse issue but it would be shipped and i would receive the following_day .
F	he came back to me and said it would be delivered that day so i made sure the was someone in at all times to take delivery and guess_what .
F	after 0_weeks i had to write again asking when they would be shipped .
M	worst customer service ever_experienced !
F	in future , i will take more notice of customer reviews of the product and be ready to return goods , if they are not absolutely right .
F	will be ordering all my medicinal items via pharmacy0u in future .
F	july .
M	then they put me on hold again , and said it is because she had a accident to which i replied " rubbish , you are a joke ! "
M	there is entirely inadequate arrangements for the return of items , lack of communication by all concerned and incompetence on a level which is more or less prevalent wherever you go these days , but nonetheless unacceptable .
M	i was let_down by another supplier so i rang plumbnation to see if they had stock of the radiator .
M	i actually recorded a short video of myself posting that test letter as evidence .
F	i opted for monovision ie a reading eye and a driving eye and personally i would not recommend this perhaps for me the sacrifice on long vision for reading was too great .
M	i '_ve purchased a few supplements in the past with great service and fast delivery . hopefully more consideration for the buyer in the future if this should happen again !!
M	when i had to collect the flowers from the dpd depot the box was half opened and crushed .
F	side note - this company is deliberately blocking negative_reviews to boost there positive_feedback .
F	we had been away the night before but luckily arrived back late that evening , otherwise it would have been outside overnight .
M	let your baby go man , improve by all means in the back - end but leave the front bits alone .
M	i managed to write about five reviews the first time without a problem . there is nothing wrong with my computer but ever_since i click on the review button for various companies it just states done . the response to my emails to support endlessly states ` can you copy and paste the urls in to an email and send it to us ?
F	yes the mirrors are expensive but definitely worth the price as the quality is excellent .
F	we look_forward to receiving a dramatically improved offer of compensation from yourselves at your earliest convenience .
M	i would advise you not to trust them .
M	this is a real investment well_worth spending on , and actually at the price it '_s a steal so don_'_t even think_twice .
F	i received it in ultra - quick time , beautifully_packaged and presented .
M	i '_ve now had to tell my son that i have no idea when his playstion will arrive because it '_s been left in the hands of lazy good for nothing drivers !
F	first_class service .
F	they said they would call the courier service and change the address with them .
M	i doubt i would have received it then without numerous_emails and a threat to cancel my order .
F	took 0_months to try and close an account , the fact that they are still trying to invoice me after i paid a final_bill is ludicrous .
F	i have recently used serenata_flowers on 0 occasions , both_times with a discount_code
F	please_note despite having asked for someone to call since i posted the original review that a manager has never contacted us to discuss the level of service we received .
M	i eventually had to drive to the depot to collect the goods .
F	it '_s a bit_tricky .
F	*** if you are cautious enough to do your homework first then i would avoid like the plague ***
M	orange_recycle gave_me the value they stated they would and payment was within 0 days .
M	very good service would definately recommend
F	please let_me know when ro expext my order !
M	one rear_light with sbc bulb ( small bayonet cap ) & three fan speeds .
M	i ordered the artisan_naturals , with the sprung divan_base , in double and six_months on i am still amazed at how comfortable and luxurious it feels .
M	easy to do , so do it
F	arrived in_tact in box , correct way up .
M	optimax were great .
M	we had to pay the fine to retrieve our parcel . which then had to be resent out to france .
F	although the price of the rangemaster and hood were excellent i was not happy with the cost of the 0 man delivery .
M	one of their original lies told to me 00months ago was that if i left them they would also delete my screen name and i ' d lose my aol . com email address - this is a lie .
F	i think that during the ordering process it should have been made clear that i was undertaking a costly international purchase which i would not have chosen to do .
F	the boiler lasted 0 hours before stopping again .
F	very impressed with the cartomiser , hasn_'_t leaked like another make i '_d got , enjoying the vg oil too .
M	on the plus_side they were helpful when i asked a question before buying .
F	document collected from uk on tues at 0pm - delivered to israel next_day even_though was told 0 - 0_days !!
M	if i add a few small items to my basket , its easy to exceed the £_00 ceiling for free delivery .
M	i bet this wont appear on your reviews , the truth hurts
F	ended our conversations with " if you need me for anything_else , please do not_hesitate to contact me ".
M	had a coffee_table turn_up with a black_mark all over it , the customer service people didnt apologise , tried to charge to me to return them and was so unhelpful .
M	i could type a lot about this company but don_'_t have time , all i will say is :
M	they say they '_ll send the returns_form but the item i ordered is no_longer produced so i opt for a refund and return the item with the now sent form .
F	disgraceful service .
M	lovely jacket , good price could not get size in stores locally .
M	their product descriptions cover all the necessary details , the ordering and delivery process is smooth , secure and has many different options and the variety of products which they have available - and in stock - is excellent .
M	summary - happy to order from them again , but in the knowledge that they may not get it right first time .
F	thank_you optimax and addie for this life_changing experience .
M	i just wanted a refund , i could then decide if i would order some more from a different batch .
M	the on - board service was terrible and they had no food left on the return_journey ; the stewards were badly trained and didn_'_t give a fig about anything , but it is a low_cost airline and they are one of the few carriers who fly directly to marrakesh .
F	i would recommend that online shoppers do not touch this company with a bargepole as my experience with them has_taught me this .
F	after having two children within 00 months of each other i was at the heaviest i '_d ever been , i was recommended to this diet , and i have to say it was amazing .
F	the shop were polite and offered to cancel the order but the price was good so i decided to stick with it and wait .
F	flowers were only ok . rose were nearly dead and one carnarion went straight in the green bin .
F	one , or both , of the items were not actually in stock ).
M	at 00 . 00 as nothing had arrived and i had to go out to a meeting i rang and was informed that the delivery had been delayed and that i had not been notified .
M	delivery slow due to stock running out , but was kept_informed straight_away about delay
F	booked a day off to receive a parcel one week and a half in_advance .
M	information displayed clearly
F	everytime i send an_email to contact the service center , there '_s only an automatical mail response .
F	it broke_down again yesterday .
M	i think it means " this item is one that we normally aim to keep in stock .
M	we have used amigo_autos for many_years_now and have always found the booking process straight_forward with no_complications .
F	i should recieve them on the fri or monday at the very latest .
M	my dissapointment is i have incurred £ 0 : 00 registered postage_costs ( as recommended by offtek ) sending back their faulty item , i would have assumed the postage to be refunded .
F	" oh i don_'_t deal with direct_debit payment plans i will pass you on " " hello direct_debit team , oh i dont deal with payment plan " " hi payment plan team , oh i don_'_t deal with a wrongly calculated bill being issued let_me pass you on ".
F	after waiting for the refund for 0_weeks , we found we were refunded all 0 flights less 0 cancelation fees after we specifically_asked them to only cancel 0 flight
F	don_'_t use this company - they will let you down !
M	takes all the pain out of searching for the best possible deal .
M	my order has not arrived yet so i cannot_comment .
F	i was also disappointed to see that the best before date for the sugar paste was end of april_0000
F	more by luck than judgement !!
F	i would use this site again .
M	but i wincingly and , i admit , patronizingly decided to click to assist them in their pointless ambition ; and found that to do so , i had to liberate my entire address book to the organizers of the virtual bar , presumably so that i become implicated in spreading this .
M	delivery was on the nail , packaging was perfect , and the plastic shop showed admirable concern that i should get my goods in perfect_condition even down to the advice about checking the goods before signing for , or accepting them .
M	item not posted promptly and they use the over priced parcelforce service .
M	it doesn_'_t seem to pay to be loyal to this company although the service is great !
M	companies like amazon could_learn a lot from go electricals speed of delivery .
F	great service .
F	good service , good quality !
M	the email from simply_electronics acknowledging my order and a subsequent email_advising about delivery were poorly formatted and difficult to decipher .
F	i could hardly see the image even when held up to bright_sunlight .
F	how long does it take to " rectify " the lack of response from the customer service team !!
M	terrible customer service and the worst i have ever_experienced .
M	items arrived as expected and are good quality .
M	great quality product and the price was by far the lowest around and delivery was free .
M	i managed to snaffle the prescription and put in the details , simple !
M	never delivered that day .
M	told that the box was damaged but the product fine .
M	0 days_later i got a cheque for the amount agreed .
M	however the next_day delivery service wasn_'_t as good as i ' d_hoped , ordered on a monday_night and parcel arrived on the thursday !
M	will update with developments .
F	would definitely recommend .
M	regards , peter adams .
F	the runner is the cheapest i have ever had , looks the most expensive and it does not move on the laminate_floor , amazing .
M	it arrived within a day of ordering it .
F	i waited 0 full year for 0 designchairs , it has_been delayed 0 times , 0 times without giving notice , i called 00 times with 0 different people , haven_'_t been called back for 0 times , emailed over 00 times , waited for my refund for 0_months untill i mailed to stefanie mueller from infurn .
M	this company is excellent if you don_'_t have a problem but any issue with the product they make life very very difficult .
M	what a bunch of absolute c ## ts .
F	the delivery was quicker_than we expected too .
M	i have been trying to get a refund on the 00 day terms of refund . customer service is hopless . and unhelpfullhave been misinformed about returning item to store . for refund . not straight_forward as led to belive wasted hours going back to store to get this refund , still trying
F	finay talk to someone and confirm to me the my goods will arrive the following_monday .
M	if you give me an email address , i would happily send you their photograph along with the one i saw on the internet so you can see what i mean .
M	many_thanks
F	i am absolutely_furious , i am a first time customer and so far your ' customer service ' has_been diabolical from_start to finish !
F	i knew i wanted to get my husband an outdoor_table_tennis_table for his_birthday but i didn_'_t have a clue which one .
F	both_times they were quick to offer solutions but not the experience that we had had with them before .
F	have ordered snails & frogs legs at christmas & more recently the aussie bbq pack .
F	although i had saved various designs , i couldn_'_t understand how to click on these previous designs and tweak the text .
M	i nearly sent them back .
F	beautiful presentation and fast efficient delivery .
M	boe has paid up front 00 . 00 . 0000 nok 0 . 000_,- rosendal has paid up front 0 . 000_,- both when ordered 00 . 00 . 0000 .
M	price is great , but great customer service means : i would of come to you first and more likely to buy from you again , instead i am indifferent when i next purchase another instrument . you are not ahead of the competition , infact even_though this is really quite minor , you dont appear to appreciate my custom . regardlless of spending over 0k with you .
M	when it was completed i was very pleased with the product .
F	the hotel is very nice , it has have 0 swimming pools , both with bars .
M	used many_times . no issues at all
F	somebody , not ' the neighbour ' delivered them yesterday ( 00 mar ).
M	the parcelhero md advised me that he would ‘ look at ’ the parcelhero customer service closing time and in addition , consider including knives in its prohibited items list .
F	i ordered on friday , product dispatched on monday and goods only arrived on thursday !
F	i got a call from mopp on the day to say she would now only be arriving at 00 : 00 .
M	once the capsule is in place it requires a lot more force to pierce the container too .
F	he gave_me direct answer straight_away without making me wait .
M	i have had to endure awful reception , constant texts about other deals and plans ( as if they weren_'_t already leaching enough money from me ) dropped calls , unsent texts , calls being ended abruptly ( often when i '_m in the middle of a sentence ) and , disturbingly often , the complete inability to even make a phone_call in the first place , which , as i am sure you can all agree , rather_defeats the purpose of being a network ; if you can '_t be absolutely certain that your customers will be able to call people on their phones what on earth is the point of trying to provide a service ?
F	orginal order took to long 0months to be exact
F	no reply .
F	great purchase .

M	i would not use molarclean again .
M	0 days still_awaiting delivery .
M	jokers .
M	i took this to mean that i was getting my order value in full so waited to get the new cheque in the post .

F	very disappointed after_spending money on " expensive flip_flops " and they have cut into my feet !
F	when i checked ths size of the box , this didn_'_t match either .

F	to order again or not ?
M	the reply_below was well received .
M	i phoned up to enquire_about my delivery , and the company did find out where my parcel was being held , but didn_'_t seem bothered about the trouble i ' d had or offer to arrange an_alternative delivery .
M	that was thursday and the helmet arrived on the saturday .
F	they were offering the product that i was buying a slightly cheaper price and i thought that i would give it a go .
M	boiler_juice does all the hard work for you sorting_out the best price and even getting you group_savings i ordered more than would fit in my tank but no problem the overpayment just sits as a credit for next time i can see no reason_why everyone would not choose boilerjuice for their heating_oil needs
M	we have already_recommended them to others and told people of the ease this company made of our dealings .
M	a very easy to use website , quality goods , and delivered very quickly .
F	on the plus_side , hudson reed '_s customer service was excellent and calberson were finally quite charming
F	après trois appels de_ma part au service clientèle de dior , toujours en contact avec la même conseillère qui me traita telle une moins que rien et voyant que ma_commande ne l ' intéressait guère , j ' ai contacté moi - même fia - net qui m ' a gentiment et promptement répondu que ma_commande avait été certifié par leurs services ( et ce , je_le rappelle , sans aucune demande de vérifications de leur part ).

M	dreadful value .
F	customer_services is terrible .
F	fully recommend this company if you are looking for carpet_runners .
F	the habitat sample_tile i ordered was fine but the customer service needs to be improved because the instruction board didn_'_t say how to order it ( only about home delivery ) and when i asked a member of staff whether i needed to order it online , he said yes .
M	im not going to tell you everything is great as its not .
F	however , my biggest ' beef ,' is the fact that some customers do not call for the service as instructed on the way back .
F	in the end a family friend who was visiting found the flowers and brought them in .

M	i ordered the south_african protea bunch of flowers and then upgraded it to the top bunch of flowers .

F	i have even received my partners window cleaning logo as one of my samples !!
M	great service thank_you cheers eugene .
F	impressed ?
F	i think it '_s important people realise resorthoppa are an agency for transfer companies so its not entirely their fault if a company is bad , they obviously do need to scrap some in mallorca altogether if they don_'_t sort things out though .

M	told friends what good value qtag is , hope they will visit your site

M	great service , tracking and delivery but the flowers came in a box and were disappointing when opened
F	i have ordered several_times from this site and while i can '_t fault the prices , i don_'_t like the fact they will buy things as f grade and sell them on as a or b !!!!

F	arranged a collection almost a week_ago for today .

M	if the kit holds up well i will probably consider ordering again -- long before the chinese new year !
F	brilliant !
M	overall , not great - 0 / 0 products were not fit for purpose , and one of those is unable to be tested due to the uncommon power_supply needed .
M	delivery slots have always been convenient and the delivery has always been within the time allotted .
F	i could not trust myself to enjoy a coffee if i could not use a damp clothe to remove any staining .
F	will never use again and would suggest others stay well clear !
M	!
M	).
M	i am_delighted by this company .
M	only tried it a few_times with a small band i '_ve joined , playing whistles and singing .

F	in fact the staff knew how far i had travelled and were very welcoming .
M	yesterday i went with my daughter who wanted to buy a lightweight laptop as she carries one about a lot .
F	i really like the cereals , especially pink apple & cinnamon porridge .
F	when arrived good service .
M	boxes are not as good as excel and need to be taped_up to stop them coming apart when pulling cable out .
F	£_000 gone as we were now too late to claim again .
F	it does not do what i wanted .
F	this was quite worrying and concerning , because i did send off my phone as soon as the package arrived - and in the end , it was acknowledged , and i got the original offer price .
F	!
M	unfortunately one of the products - 0 litres of chassis cleaner - leaked during_transit .
M	shame really because their choice of goods , prices and delveries are amongst the best but oh , the total disrespect to after sales customer service is one , if not , the worst i '_ve ever come_across !
M	the attention to detail is amazing , including : folding pedals to avoid hitting our leg when pushing the bike , or to avoid damaging doorways when taking the bike indoors , sturdy kickstand with locking_mechanism enabling the bike to be parked on any slope ; hinged saddle to enable the removal of the battery without loosening the seat post , etc .
F	flowers hadn_'_t been delivered by yodel by 0pm .
M	they did however leave them on the back step , and came back on the friday to pick_up the damaged shelves .
M	faultless service .
F	described as a value product and it most definitely was price_wise , performance wise no_complaints and its already been put to the test !
F	please_please be aware of this disasterous company
F	so i called tuesday to be advised “ the lady in despatch wasn_’_t in yesterday ” one lady ?!
M	bearing in mind we arrived at nearly 00pm so it was nearly the end of our night and we had nowehere to stay .
F	took_advantage of a ' 0 for 0 ' on tops offer , only came to £_00 total for 0 tops . oh plus £ 0 . 00 delivery . only 0 tops came as the other was out of stock . two_weeks_later the other top turned_up , charged me another £ 0 . 00 for delivery and tried to charge me another £ 0 for the top , argued it and they knocked the £ 0 off like they should ( esp as the promotion is still running !)
M	i was told i would have the missing parts the next_day but they were sent by royal_mail standard delivery so again it took 0 - 0 days to get them , when they arrived they were the wrong_size and a different_colour .
F	bought perfume for my daughter , couldn_'_t_believe_how much i got it for , £_00 less_than in the high_street shops !

M	now it '_s supposed to come friday .
F	delivery is free , as long as you don_'_t want next_day , even on a sunday .
M	support say it will be released in time to preload - not true ( unless you have insane (> 00mbps ) broadbnad ).
M	will not be using this service again and will be advising friends and family to steer_clear .
M	the new chainset is costing me £_00 . 00 ( original ) + 00 . 00 = £_000 . 00
F	the whole_experience was upsetting and embarrassing and as far as the company was concerned ( as i '_ve no reply ) the flowers are delivered , end of story .
M	hi i think everything is perfect about this company , theres just one thing , when i first heard about this company it said the highest prices you could_find going , but ive found a website called simplydrop and every phone published on it you can get more than every phone published on mazuma .
M	very helpful and friendly service
F	she explained that you have to pull a drop down_menu to get this , but when you have only just started_using the computer you don_'_t always see these things .
M	not sufficient to entice my custom and i did expect delivery charge to be actually refunded .
F	still nothing !
F	everyone i spoke to was helpful , providing excellent service despite needing my item re - quoting for several_times .
F	i know i love the shoes as have other pairs , but interlink failed to deliver and the other pair i ordered at the same time from a different supplier arrived two_days ago by royal_mail . no problem .
F	it was fairly quick and easy and i recurve some spare cash at the end of it .
F	the phones were still collected though !
F	very quick and efficient service from the watch shop who have a large and varied_selection of watches for all_budgets .
F	i never buy anything without checking to see if i can earn some cash_back and i am so pleased with the amount of money this has saved me over the past three years .
M	somehow i accidentally paid for a years membership in one lump_sum rather_than for a monthly_subscription , this was an honest mistake so i wrote to them asking to change to the monthly_subscription and to be refunded the money i had paid .
F	fantastic really pleased with both_pairs of rayban 0000 glasses .
M	ordered again in february when trainers were back in stock but after 0_weeks nothing received .
F	however , the bag it came in was without a draw and the bag was damaged in parts , which was annoying to hold it closed to protect my helmet from falling out .
M	i used to order from svp on a weekly_basis , sometimes more , but in the past year their poor stock control , faulty item and appalling delivery has meant i have had to look_elsewhere .
M	after payment via_paypal cost had risen to £_000 without_any explanation that i could see .
F	delivery of the bed was organised swiftly and it arrived when expected .
F	they then said it would be worth £ 0 . 00 and if i didn_'_t want it £ 0 . 00 to send the mobile back .
F	my daughter wants rollerskates for christmas so i went straight to that bookmark , we found what we wanted no problem out of great choices .
M	same lady .
M	wasn_'_t impressed with the flowers arriving in a box to be fair . the bouquet didn_'_t really look like it did online and they didn_'_t arrive in style . plain looking white_van . 0 out of ten for me .
M	i re - run the email and log - in process to get the same result .
F	the flowers looked quite a bit smaller in life than i had imaged when iooking at the pictures .
M	don_'_t shop at asda !!
M	), royal_mail refused recorded delivery ( due to the size of the parcel ), item was returned via_parcelforce ( and this cost 00 gbp ).
F	yes it all went well to the part where they were to notify_me about my order having been delivered .
M	ok i got the call and i accepted just to get my products on facebook , but only after negotiating £_00 for 0 year .
M	it is affordable and compettative with a great back up service .
M	products arrived as ordered within 00_hours - superb !
M	i was left with a promise that the ' d contact me when the goods were in stock and i could re - order but of course they don_'_t contact you .
F	i found out at 0pm on the day of the birthday that in my case they couldn_'_t .
M	when i rang up to speak to someone to get the remainder of the sets sent to me , i was disappointed to find i could not have the discounted set price now and would have to buy the pedestal mats separately !
F	i am thinking_about buying some more for work and some for my conservatory too .
F	i checked by phone that it had been received on the 00th and later that day an e_- mail confirmed that the order had been despatched .
F	i will buy stuff like this again from kenable .
M	the glow_sticks where pretty good i got multi colours ones the white ones are pointless the stop glowing after about 0 mins and all the rest say they glow for 0 hours but they are only bright for about 0 hours and then a very dim light for the rest of the 0 hours .
M	the first order was paid , the money disappeared from my account i received an e_- mail with orders , but still you say to me that with the money you did not grow !
M	if after_reading this you chose to do_business with them , don_'_t say you weren_'_t warned !
F	and so it continued .
F	have phoned cheap_smells and they said rest of order is on way but heavier items are sent differently ?!
F	do not use eon for boiler repairs
M	the " expert " roy had written to me telling_me how to set_up the thermostat which i duly did and it still didn_'_t work .
F	site makes it easy for me to make an informed choice as to the best products for me .
M	however , i feel having to pay for a full_tank of fuel and trying to return the car on empty is somewhat of a scam .
F	they always meet your required date deadline , even at short_notice .
F	there are some great products and items that i can not find anywhere_else from this company , not to mention the great prices .
M	quick and easy to deal with .
F	magic fit is excellent being on the larger side being_able to buy in confidence is a great asset i will definitely use golfgarb again & recommend it to my golfing partners with no_hesitation

F	i live far away and that is why i chose to use this service .
M	but was told they would be sorted , so i bought the .
F	my oder was for animal_feed for both dogs and my very precious rare_breed cavies .

M	unfortunately , two of the threaded bars that fix the legs to the table were of the wrong_size - i reported this to them and was told by email that i would get a call on the 00th to arrange replacement parts .
F	when they were returned to school after the first term , the blue had turned to pink !
M	they took my money and then couldn_'_t confirm the flight or provide a ticket .
F	the bouquet was also very small for the price and to say i paid_extra for a bigger bouquet .
F	a really good online shopping_experience .
M	when providing this product , you should let people know who is the manufacture .
M	cant_believe_how good my props are for the price , great quality and great value !
M	ik_heb toen snel de_klantenservice moeten bellen om twee van_de drie boekingen ongedaan te maken .
M	everyone i spoke to was helpful and delivered everything they said they would when they said they would .
M	when second item was delivered the box was ripped right open and roof_bars scratched all over .
F	dont hesitate to use this company .
M	will_continue to buy from here as quick and has very good variety and stock_levels
M	that is poor price match claim
M	i gave up trying to chase my money and will be more careful in future .

F	- flowers don_'_t look anything like what u see on the website , i mean totally different !
F	the time_slot is 0 am - 0 pm .
M	highly_recommended !
M	i '_ve added a star , but with the caveat that it took a poor review here , and a paypal claim , to get any action , and the stock status issue is not ideal .
M	maybe they just save_money by having us punters do the work for them or maybe they would just have charged me for the damage if i hadn_'_t spent 00_mins documenting it , either way that could have been better service if they had made an accurate record of the damage instead of telling_me there was none .
M	their rma process is problematic as well .
M	i was promptly kept_informed of what the status of my order was .
F	he assured me my purchase would be with me shortly .
M	just ordered more flowers , giving them a second chance and used the before_noon service at extra_cost , flowers turned_up near 0 hours late !

F	not impressed .
M	while the harassed staff were doing their best they seemed to have no management support . we caught a dfds_ferry from dover the following_day and whilst the staff were very helpful at dover they did not know we were coming which surprised me .

F	for three_days i called every_single number listed at the bottom of their website , including for their_offices abroad .

F	i rang ao but there answer was " it '_s delivered by 0rd_party ".

F	a friend told me about vio_vet , and i was so happy she did .

M	we were looking for a good quality modern mirrored side board , to replace our perfectly fine 00 year_old wooden display_cabinet .
M	displays were very messy , with product specifications usually inadequate up or covered up by clutter .
F	service companies who receive monies for supplying a service should be accountable for checking the information they supply and confirming correctly to the client - not shrugging it off as not their fault .!
M	now that i have my ramp i am more than pleased
M	ordered some sunglasses after finding a great deal on groupon ( props to that guys ) on a sunday_night .

F	paid for next_day delivery and had to wait three_days .
F	travelling with different carriers , baggage_allowance very difficult to understand
M	what do you think the chances of getting the new bracket are ( marks from 0 - 00 ) and what are the chances of getting a refund when i '_ve sent it back ( marks again 0 - 00 ).
M	we are a large half timbered tudor style build with two restaurants and a six letting rooms above ; drivers have to drive past us to travel through the village , and as the delivery driver is supposed to leave a card indicating that ‘ they had tried but failed to make delivery ’ and didn_’_t .
F	but the brake cable keep on snapping .
F	quality of material poor and extra thread hanging everywhere .
F	and in this case , serenata completely failed to live up to the task .
M	however on this occasion i have forgiven the lapse in communication and forgetton item due to the quality of flowers .
M	i got the standard feedback email from just eat which i responded explaining the takeaway was not its usual standard , i was amazed to receive an email from just eat a day later explaining the takeaway had " barred " me due to leaving the feedback !

F	helpful member of staff , after which things moved very swiftly .
M	they each had a pretty poor selection on mitts in general and none of them stocked the ones on my short list .
F	i recently bought some things for my 00th_birthday_party , the goods came and were well_packed and what i had ordered , i have used partyrama before and had no_problems but on this occasion the helium i bought was not full and yes i do know how to use the containers as i have had them before with out any_issues .
F	i bought a very expensive bikini and paid the premium price for next - day delivery .
F	a waste of mine and their money !
F	i have no way of telling who is at fault .

F	what kind of company is this !
M	next_day i tracked the parcel online , the parcel was at the local wrexham service centre ( yodel ),
M	customer service is hit or miss .
M	we also bought a charles_eames hang it all a few_months_ago .
F	i phoned ( reluctantly as it is not a free call ), got through easily to a " real " person to check whether my request had gone_through , which apparently it hadn_'_t .

F	!

F	i cannot recommend them highly_enough .
M	will use again !
F	it would be better if you could book the extras at the time of booking , saving time when checking your car in .
M	being in the building_trade i '_m always buying new tools , i '_ve spent_thousands over the years and always searched online for the best deals as anyone would , toolstop have such competitive_prices that their website is the only one i buy from .
F	when i rang them the next_day , they were unable to give any reason_why no one had come to collect our parcel .
F	beautiful flowers , as shown on the website .
F	the website was clear and ordering simple .
M	i had no service from them .
F	i am in the process of evaluating these coffees
F	so far so good .
M	com and the reason they can ' buy any car ' is that they offered me about a third of their market value ( a third of what i then sold them for privately ).
F	i tried to do this on several_occasions but have been unable to get as far as the shopping_basket .
M	if you operate a ' good cop bad cop ' routine there it '_s working .
F	she said the system didn_'_t pick_up the order , and it '_s now out of stock .
M	now taking steps through trading_standards to report the fraud and claiming via credit_card company .

M	other than that we '_ve been really pleased with the package , grand kids really appreciated the buckets and spades !
F	i ordered some great flint grey skinny cords which i could not find anywhere in size 00 except for you .
M	this is an excellent store where you can find every product on the market , but the shipping is expensive .
M	0 ) if you do purchase don_’_t pay in full / upfront as we did .
F	great product high_quality , but i '_m still wondering_if it was worth the waitt and the hassle .
M	i was very pleased with all_aspects of my order
M	will buy from this seller again .
F	was pretty straightforward to order flowers .
M	i have had to support it with a tiny kids magnet .
F	the polo neck sweater ; is supposedly lambs_wool but it is very itchy and unpleasant to wear .
M	i blew ten_pounds on a service that i can '_t even use .
F	for the price i was expecting more .
F	also reassured me i could potentially collect them from the venue if the seller lets me down .
F	really well pleased with evert item .
M	to keep it simple i would just say that the experience was good for me .
M	ordered three items and these were meant to be delivered at the same time .
F	however on this occasion i made the mistake of booking a top_secret_hotel for my boyfriend '_s birthday .
F	i signed reluctantly but put on it they were unchecked .
M	very happy with the fast and effective service recieved delivery within 00_hours and only prderd on the bank_holiday , usually there '_s a back log and delay at there times , defiantly will use this site again
M	really good experience from the website to delivery .
F	!
F	i also like that you can make a personalized account and you can show others where you have traveled !
F	no refund telephoned again and they said as it was a large_amount they will have to send it by cheque ?????????????
M	perfect
M	not the normal quality you get from sunrise medical products .
M	shame .
F	i would recommend them to anyone .
F	would definitely use again , and not_hesitate to recommend
F	villa in a lovely spot , ideal for beach and walking into_town .
M	would definitely recommend .
M	very disappointing .
F	have always used maxitone products , taste great aswell .
F	when i called the after sales service they said the documentation showed i had taken the polish at the time of purchase , which was untrue .
F	00th_october still absolutely nothing , no delivery , no email giving an update !!!
M	sent photos to their resolution team and have as yet not heard_anything other than standard we have received your message reply .
M	all in all a very enjoyable course & will_definately_use again in the future ( hope there system comes back online by then !)
M	i have been with rms for several_years_now and wish i had found them sooner .
M	i would highly_recommend animed_direct to anybody
F	i have happened to just log_into my account at rtb ( to find an_alternative way to communicate with them ) and found out it has_been completed . why didn_'_t i get a notification that it had finally been complete ?
M	anyway , i will now leave them and go_elsewhere as it was dangerous to leave a lone female at night on a busy_road and just bull *** her about policy to avoid any form of help !
F	consignment numbers are as follows_:
M	in short , a very stressful experience i will not be in a hurry to repeat .
M	bt very poor service !
M	but how they run a company with so much damaged goods of which they don_'_t want returned , i just don_'_t understand .
M	i would thoroughly recomend this site and would also use this site again .
F	i have ordered from little_sunflowers a couple of times and have had no_problems .
M	to get this crb take few weeks ?
F	the toyota was far below the quality that we were expecting .
M	very good service cheap pricesand very fast delivery service wil do_buisness again
M	i have used this company many_times and the service is always good .
M	otherwise well happy
F	great , quick and helpful
M	first time using kenable super service very efficient , good prices , very quick delivery informed of tracking every_step of the way very impresive
F	however , the reason i would hesitate to buy again from worldstores is that the product descriptions and photographs on their website are really not good enough .
F	also , i could not exchange my goods .
M	wtf am i supposed to do ?
M	( order no .
F	everything arrived exactly as promised , and was beautifully_packed so there is hardly_any breakage at all .
M	i wanted to check that the club i ' d ordered was left_handed and when i got no response to my email , i checked the website and it appeared that my order had been cancelled .
F	there has_been no communication about delivery .
F	yours_faithfully
F	thanks , for your reply lindsay .
M	being a corporate customer of ups , i know that ups will not charge parcelhero full - rate for this .
F	another order delivered with ease .
F	craig was so wonderful with matthew , very kind , respectful and helpful and i cannot strongly_recommend him highly_enough to other parents who have disabled children who play the drums to visit .
M	competitive tyre prices .
F	speedy delivery and excellent quality chocolate !
F	so never_heard_anything .
F	we '_ve fought with them for compensation since may and have finally had to admit defeat , accepting a miserly payment of £_000 for a holiday that cost us in excess of £ 0000 .
F	i am a very happy customer .
F	she promised to call me back the next_day once she had a chance to contact wally ’_s manager .
F	it was way below it '_s stated hours that it should last and because it was over 0 years they weren_'_t really interested .
F	thankyou
F	they need to buck it up there are a lot of great , vegan , organic beauty companies out there which i will happily spend my money on instead of a company where you have no fallback or support when there are issues with their products .
F	my only piece of advice would be that when a delay is expected it would be good to have notice in order to keep the customer informed and unconcerned .
F	i don_'_t want to pay for a service from a company run by a bunch of cowboys .
F	when i received the vouchers i went on the website and tried to order them .
M	also , why do they feel they can just take the money off you before telling you they are going to do it ?
F	guess_what ?
M	didn_'_t see " as a gift " tick_box on checkout .
F	superb quality and value and prompt emails replying to query as to delivery time .
F	they offered next_day delivery and they arrived as promised .
F	no explanation or apology offered .
M	once parked i then located my email , and realised that it was probably safer to leave as once you have pressed the green button your booking is not recognised .
F	not to order dvds .
M	i have in the past spent much more on inferior goods , and have already_recomended your company to friends and relations , as i work in the theatre i am frequently attending first nights and royal galas for which we need to wear formal attire i shall definately be using your sevice again .
F	i can not default delivery or order process of my purchases .
F	my old tumble_dryer gave up the ghost at lunchtime on saturday .
F	i know they were oly £_00 . 00 but still :(
F	i ordered a barbour_jacket that was reasonably_priced with a 00_% deduction off the marked price .
F	the padding that covers the springs is torn where the straps are to be tied to the trampoline frame .
F	i strongly_suggest you try petfleas . co . uk as they provided me with a first_class extremely quick service .
F	it was delivered late first of all and once opened it look nothing like it did online .
M	a website which clearly enabled_me to order from scotland .
F	prompt delivery , good communication , decent prices .
M	no issues with the product there was no damage and the packaging was very tidy and well_protected .
F	the website was easy to use and gave a very comprehensive_range of sizes and styles .
F	one ( large box with folding lid ) was so badly broken it can '_t be used , and the damage obviously occurred as a result of a heavier item being dumped in the box on top of it .
M	just stayed one day in london and they delivered as promised !
M	ph effected a collection for me from an ebay_seller with no_fuss at all .
M	00 days_later a claim_form arrived asking for two repair estimates which we sent immediately .
F	our bags arrived promptly and were exactly_what we had asked for .
F	for this very reason , i doubt i will ever purchase from this company again .
F	thank_you for such a good service .
F	!
M	!
F	the package was not cellophane_wrapped as perfume normally is , which makes me question the authenticity .
F	i rearranged to have it delivered the following_monday as they don_'_t deliver over the weekend .
F	l0dab00 - 000 ( an instruction_manual for a logik dab_radio l0dab00 purchased for my husband for christmas ).
M	the sample service was really useful to picture the product ( they refund the cost if you place an order ).
F	but it '_s fine , because all calls are recorded , so they will be able to see !
F	the retailer sold out of items in my size , and now advise that the item is now discontinued .
F	i told them this was not good enough as the prices of the flight had already gone up £_00 .
M	they did not arrive until 0 . 00pm on the day after that which is not really acceptable
M	thank_you for your recent_purchase from urbanindustry . co . uk .
M	they arrived in good time and were excllent quality .
F	am i at risk of fraud as i gave them details - name , number , address , email , password ??
F	i ordered flowers on wed 00st_march for my parents - in - law 00th_wedding_anniversary on saturday 0rd_april .
M	another email was sent and i got the reply that they might not be able to cancel the order as it was being readied for despatch .
M	all in all , frustrating experience , although happy with the final product , just could have been so much_better .
M	not sure if i would use them again
F	it wasn_'_t but at_least this time the local supplier contacted me to say they hadn_'_t received the basins so therefore couldn_'_t deliver to me .
M	however .
M	a month later the blue_chip are to date yet to respond , perhaps what you should expect after they have your money banked .
F	thanks
M	ive given flubit a try .
M	i now use city_link through interparcel and am getting a better service and the driver that collects form me is very good and takes care with the parcels and i have had no_complaints from my customers with the condition they arrive in
F	just to note that on their website under the returns_policy it states that any un - wanted items can be returned but will only be exchanged for store credit .
F	i emailed both the delivery company and ecco about this .
F	i would definitely recommend envirofone above any other mobile phone exchange service
F	goods were competitively_priced with free delivery and were dispatched immediately and delivered within 00_hours , worked a treat dog was better in no time
F	for delivery destination ( it was on the order ).
M	i was only one in queue by this time but 00mins later there was a queue_behind me and now 00 sainsburys staff dealing_with 0 same woman .
M	you have the option to do this online , so why they feel the need to phone you up in respect of this was baffling .
F	i did receive it quite quickly but i was irritated by being sent texts and emails saying that , without a signature , the prescription could not be serviced .
M	we went to the shop and had excellent service and advice . delivery was as stated with plenty of warning for the times etc
M	then order from bedtimeheaven . co . uk instead , they deliver within a couple of days .
M	i fact i ' d go as far as to say 0 out of 0 !
F	however , a major_issue developed with regard to delivery .
F	also they emailed me to say they would be putting an ingredients_list on their website but never did , which makes me frustrated / angry !
M	kept_informed all along the way goods arrived on time .
F	therefore not wasting my time .
F	with the advent of digital_cameras , i have been enabled to print from images
F	!
F	heavy solid items with fragile pastries or fruits .
M	the problem is they have a captive public who can '_t choose any alternative so you ' re at their mercy .
M	and being told the transport would be 00 - 00_minutes almost two hours_later it finally arrived with the comments that the guy_who took my phone_call had turned off the fones so they went to answer phone .
M	i am not stupid and i know what breakdown insurance is and i also know i can get it far more cheaply than ao '_s offer .
M	it was agreed in principle – then suddenly declined .
M	very simple to order and delivered exactly as stated .
M	i wanted a specific av_receiver that was not in stock in the bournemouth store , and although some were showing at other stores further away , the salesman said i would have to go there to pick it up , and recomended a more_expensive alternative make .
M	tyre now fitted and no_complaints on that score , but the extra journey to have it fitted eroded any benefit they had on cost saving over the other available garage via black_circle tyres and being treated so contemptuously doesn_'_t tempt me to return for other three tyres that i will need later this summer .
M	on top of that the postage was underpaid so i has to pay the 00p shortage plus a £ 0 fee .
F	first_class service that i would definitely use again and recommend to anyone .
M	always had problems with my signal on talk_talk internet was very disappointed with this as i had to phone nearly twice a week and found nothing was ever done to help the situation .
F	mind is at peace now , thank_you testme !
M	the service was great .
M	i will be buying another to replace a much_cheaper sliding_door gear which has developed problems with use
M	0_weeks_later and my current data has_gone out of control .
F	on looking through these there were none of my daughter but many of a small number of children ( mostly children of the organisers , interestingly ).
F	i '_m not very happy with the trim though , it '_s not very straight and doesn_'_t look neat where it is stuck on .
M	when i arrived to their office i realiyed that i could get the car for the same price only if i want it without insurance .
F	the website is very clear and easy to use .
M	especially after explaining why and how i was using the service .
M	i would strongly_recommend them as reliable , honest and a great value service at home / work .
M	all i ever get is i will look into it but they don_'_t ,
F	he was very knowledgeable and experienced .
F	very happy with my glasses .
F	i will be recommending glasses_direct to all . my friends .
M	i have used parcel0go on two occasions , first time the parcel collection failed , twice .
F	something that is not stated at any time during the holiday booking process , making this a hidden charge .
M	although the store did contact me very quickly to advise me of this which was to their credit , it meant that i had to re - order the next_day from some where else , as i was on a tight_schedule this resulted_in a delay in receiving my goods in time for what they were intended .
M	" we tested the paper your are referring and a lot of other baryta style papers but we found that the canson baryta is a much shaper and better coating and gave better results all_round generally .
F	so far , any contact i have had with the company has_been contradictary and insincere about the impact they have caused .
F	the option of trying 0 frames foc is brilliant and makes the whole task much_easier .
M	and never had anyproblems .
F	i specifically left details for the parcel to be left with neighbours or in our shed and left the back gate open for this purpose .
F	communication is wonderful as they text to let you know that your order has left their premises and text again when the order has_been delivered .
M	no problem with that , these things_happen .
M	the ps_vita was described as 0g .
M	hello ,
F	i have been trying for 0_weeks to find out what is happening to the 0 orders i have made for flea and tick_treatment for my dogs .
M	would recommend to anyone .
F	i could place an order for 0 different items and not know until the check out that it could be 0 different companies who all want to charge me postage and have different delivery times up to 00 days .
M	service and voucher worked well but ended_up with additional 00 euro insurance to cover breakdown , tyres , windows and a load of other things the no excess_insurance didn_'_t cover .
M	overall , i would not buy the same chairs again from homebase - i would choose another product instead .
M	whilst acceptingbthat damage can occur , to lose £_00 in value over a plastic back costing a couple of piunds smacks of greed .
F	this isn_'_t really a justifiable reason as i imagine that you should be able to still run a business when a few people take a day off .
F	we have asked for a refund .
F	frustratingly , they won_'_t deliver so you can collect your parts in store - so with working full time and a large parcel being delivered , i '_d another trip to the post_office depot to collect it .
M	i whont you guys to stop changing people for enrolement , i need my money backpls
F	).
F	we ordered a hardback_photobook as well as a kitchen calendar .
M	great website with a variety of products available .
F	from the experience .
F	penalties ?
M	have not even had the courtesy of a reply .
F	i purchased 0 large bags of dog_food from this company and after using the first one ( which took a couple of months to get through ) opened the 0nd to find it mouldy .
F	just wont to say thankyou thankyou with your help i was able to get the perfect present for my boyfriend . not only was it easy but fast , relieable and very very helpfull i will keep your address on my contact list for future gifts .
M	took the helmet out and was missing the throat wind shield and scuffs inside the box .
M	excellent service .
M	excellent service , and very pleased with the product .
M	otherwise things went well .
M	not sure what do you think ?
F	to date i have sent two email with no reply , so you can work out what sort of company they are .
M	therefore very disappointed .
F	not got them yet but i '_m feeling slightly more at ease !
F	friendly , helpful , a pleasure to deal with .
M	you couldn_'_t ask for better value broadband and calls than my deal with talktalk ( previously tiscali ) but the different parts of the company don_'_t talk top each other and when something_goes_wrong the customer_services_department simply cannot fix it .
M	also less expensive than a rival online site .
M	i '_ve had tyres_fitted at the same outlet twice previously during the week and been fully_satisfied with their service .
F	the aroma is an out of body experience .
M	bought a £ 0 , 000 . 00 pc its worth every_penny and im very happy with it , and the time it took to get here was very quick just a shame that i turned it on and it keeps_crashing due to the graphics_card being faulty and have to send it .
F	good linking from text to my pc .
F	the man has complete attitude !
M	everything was ready for me and as i had been expected i wasn_'_t made to wait .
F	this company took the biscuit .
M	customer_services were prompt in a response after stating they had been reported to trading_standards for not making me aware at any point of the ordering_process i was purchasing outside the uk .
F	perhaps if accident_helpline provided me with a reference i could verify who i '_m speaking to .
M	when i realised my mistake i emailed them on a saturday_night .
M	bought from sunglass_shop before and bought form them again when i lost a pair of ray_bans .
F	this was very tricky because the turkish representatives spoke little english and so i had to ask our hotel reception staff to speak with them for us .
M	to be honest i '_ve never got the time to drive here and there to check prices , so i looked through the obvious ( and some less obvious ) websites to see what sort of deal i could get .
M	shes were returned .
M	paid by paypal and credit_card debited immediately .
M	good quality watch , well_packaged , decent price .
M	avoid !
F	they gave_me the tracking_number , i went online and it said ' delivery failed - address query '.
M	i then got another email from liberro giving me another discount_voucher_code , so this time i went in and placed an order and when checking out entered the voucher number as emailed to me , however i was advised online that the voucher was not valid !
F	the end_result was fabulous and my dad thought it was a wonderful christmas gift .
F	long_queues to check in and slow . no apology from receptionist .
F	contacted_iflorist via website to ascertain whether delivery had been made .
M	we received a call to say that the lorry had broken down and would not come .
M	con merchants .
F	the returns process is very poorly explained , they email in very abrupt short sentences and don_'_t seem to follow_up on assurances .
F	so glad i changed .
F	the label was not secure so fell_off and was jammed inside the paper so no one knew who they were from .
F	the product hasn_'_t arrived as yet even_though it was due to be re delivered last wed .
F	a good & varied choice of nets .
M	so this leads me to believe either their checking process is not thorough or they claim the odd item missing to get a bit of extra money for themselves .
F	in fact , there was nothing comparable within the store to what i eventually bought .
M	i '_ve now had to process it through my credit_card as a disputed item .
F	i '_m_sure it wasn_'_t your fault that the boots took quite so long to arrive but i did have to phone four times and was always told they would be with me later that week which they never were .
M	i ordered the pump .
M	the experience is absolutely shiv kin and makes e_- bay look like harrods by comparison .
M	when i complained that i couldn_'_t find these , i was told they had not yet been made !
M	by monitoring the web_site i was able to watch how the first proposed in - stock date was moved 0 times !
F	silver earrings were delivered in this silver jiffy_bag , with the gift box flattened , the silver earrings were just in this see through bag , when looking at them through the bag i could see that the posts on both were bent , i wasn_'_t pleased , it takes you a long time to choose a gift for somebody so when this happens .
M	this impressed my as i had anticipated having to " prove " i hadn_'_t received my parcel some how .
F	bought my tickets then printed them out , no more worrying will they make it through the post .
M	should have just gone with bodybuilding . com which gets their stuff out here in 0 days tops .
F	i have ordered a premium quality book .
M	reccomended reliable and very convenient to post
F	i have found cex a very good store and the staff are very helpful .
F	however , the speed of delivery was good and it suited the purpose in the end .
F	very poor service from both groupon and discountemporium . co . uk
F	however , this has always been in the actual store .
M	first thing we do is learn to speak .
F	!
M	000cm
M	i will use and recommend it in the future .
M	would recommend 000_%.
F	--- update ---
F	other than that , things i brought were competitive in price .
F	emailed labels are very hard to understand and you have to organise collection on net ( took me half a hour as tracking_number written differently on site ).
M	with the discount_code the two_pairs of glasses were amazing value .
F	after 00_minutes to a premium_rate number , the advisor finally said that the earliest he would be able to cancel is the 00th of august anyway as this was the expiry_date .
M	despite this chaos_cards do offer decent prices for the more modern products .
F	he automatically_added polish to my bill without giving me the option to say no .
M	futher to the 0nd response from this company , i would ask any other poster to read my review here or my emails and point out any rude or aggressive language .
M	0st time i ordered 0 things .
F	service was fast and efficient .
M	the dom & gen offering at £ 0 . 00 pm gives exactly the same protection as that offered via ao .
F	all in all , it was too late for me to find an_alternative as they called too late on the same day and they delivered late the next_day .
F	because i have three children i must be poor right !
M	on both_occasions i have been disappointed with their vehicles . l sat year the vehicle was damaged and marked at the rear , this year the vehicle was badly marked all over with dents and scrapes .
F	great service and easy to talk to will contact you with date changes and very helpful
F	strap and toe clip on pedals
F	a very fast service .
F	however that is if the goods arrive and in a usable condition .
F	there was an obvious fault somewhere along the line as it proved impossible to enter the wowcher credit number anywhere & i wasted almost an_hour repeatedly trying .
F	i '_ve_used gear0music loads of times and pretty_much rebuilt my drum_kit with the things i '_ve bought off them .
M	is it really that hard to keep your stock updated online ?!
F	i will be buying all my future pet_supplies from this company .
F	still to this day i have not received an_alternative appointment .
F	the reasons behind why they couldn_'_t change the address didn_'_t make_sense as i asked them to change the address on the same day i ordered the flowers !
M	this online store is extremely useful .
M	i double_checked to make_sure it was their warehouse as_opposed to delonghi '_s as i already knew that they did not have stock .
M	the out of this world customer service .
F	so damn angry with this company .
M	i really am not impressed with this experience , and will almost certainly use a local supplier from now on .
M	i was contacted by boots to tell me my parcel would be delivered on 00th_jan_0000 .
M	worktops delivered on time by friendly staff .
M	i might get my money back if fedex can find out where its gone , but maybe i won_'_t .
M	i had emailed this company several_times to organize the return of the merchandise shortly_after i had received the wrong item , but received no reply to my emails .
F	however , this is the second occasion i have ordered from you , and on both_occasions the item was out of stock .
M	it would be beneficial to both the customer and supplier ( reduce unnecessary costs ) if a pre_- notification of forthcoming autodispatch was sent to customers a couple of weeks in advance asking them to confirm or change the arrangements .
M	thought the quality was good and was good value for money , was let_down by the missing roof felt and that when i emailed i did not get a response from them .
M	the amp was shipped in only the manufacturers cardboard_box which offered minimal protection and , as a result , several of the plastic corner ' bumpers ' were broken on arrival .
F	we were very impresssed with the care and efficiency the customer_services team gave_us and the products are perfect .
F	if i '_d seen this review website before i would have shopped elsewhere !
F	when goods arrived unfortunately they didn_'_t fit so i sent those back .
M	will up date this after this date .
M	so overall , i am happy given the price i paid .
M	i didn_'_t get it all last time !
F	i sent an_email straight_away to cancel and amend the dates but wqs tol this was not acceptable .
M	thanks ,
F	bread is best around , some fruit and veg good .
M	regards
F	twice_now animed_direct have dispatched my cats cystitis pills never received , the most_recent order being 0000000 .
F	they told me that it was irrelevant to them .
F	so after_contacting iflorist 0 times i have still not received a refund or redelivery .
M	really frustrated with the service - bad delivery - ordered and paid extra £ 0 for next_day delivery ( and before the cut - off time ), next_day delivery was confirmed , they charged me £ 0 .
F	i sent off the phones and within 0_days i had £_00 .
F	and customer_services were not helpful .
F	i '_m afraid this is not the case at all .
F	excellent value for money and fantastic customer service .
M	highly_recommended .
M	price isnt everything !
F	on arrival , it turns_out to be most definitely yellowy cream .
F	have arrived_safely and service excellent .
F	they are thieves , steal your phone and give you nothing , please_beware do not use !!!!!!!
M	ordered replament valliant roof brackets and was to be delivered 00th_june .
F	00_% of the photos had heads chopped_off a waste of money .
F	the book took hours to create as it kept freezing and crashing .
F	i am going to get back to my sewing which will i hope be much_easier now .
F	i ordered the wrong_size laptop bag - which was my own fault .
M	very competitive and easy to use .
M	although anna said that this wasn_'_t so .
M	excellent .
M	i can not fault merlin_cycles on price , which is just as well because if anything_goes_wrong and you have to deal with their employees then you are met with complete indifference to your plight .
M	i do hope the sort_out the delivery difficulties though , sometimes i have waited a bit too long for a delivery .
F	until they do this , and advise me accordingly , it is unlikely that i will place any further orders withj them .
F	cabin fabulous quality and good value , delivered quickly from phone_call , but customer service awful .
M	a week_later , no response , so i resent it and asked if they ' d received it .
F	when i had a few questions they helped_me via instant messager .
F	i then received a revised_offer from bozowi of £_000 with them stating : ' engineers have tested your phone and have found that your phone has a significant scratches on the unit or screen that does not meet the minor wear and tear criteria .
F	i will_definately recommend it and consider_buying again if i can get the lens problem sorted as the price is extremely good .
M	i would_gladly pay more for a smaller coach and a speedier transfer as this is just getting too long .
M	this is such an unprofessional setup .
F	i have contacted the winerist for organising a short personalised trip for a group of 0 people in one of the wine regions of france .
F	it hasn_'_t put me off recommending you but would suggest that people don_'_t try to buy obscure sizes like i did !
M	i have purchased from here before normally o . k , but the last pair were so shoddy it was like they were made by a child in primary_school , they did not fit as the arms were at different_angles and the actual frame work around the lens was twisted .
M	had an instance recently when they didn_'_t pickup , i spoke to internet operator who cancelled order , promised to feedback but none .
M	another customer service advisor (!)
F	00 days_later , still no refund .
F	i purchased a wardrobe with a drawer beneath .
F	punctual
M	such s shame as the rugs are lovely and arrived quickly .
F	they arrived within 00_hours and i was very pleased with quality .
M	what a joke - since when does next_day delivery end up not arriving the next_day when you wait in all day for it ?
M	i rejected it .
F	excellent service .
M	one very happy customer , thank_you .
M	i explained that i wanted to travel the day before and by the time ( 0 mins ) that i had got through to the payment screen the quoted price had increased by over 000_pounds .
M	i can highly_recommend lesar uk .
F	highly_recommended - one very satisfied_customer
F	she didn_'_t even know the flowers were from me .
F	i called twice and spoke to helpful advisors who clarified i would first be charged_£ 0 for sending my item back ' post free ' on the return_label .
M	customer_services are worst then i have ever came_across - so poor that i have decided not to buy anything from them ever .
M	the item was a good price , marked as a ' sale ' item at the time .
F	have recommended to others and will certainly buy from them again .
F	i have used this site for many_years & haven_'_t had no_problems when it comes to delivery . i placed a order on 00 / 00 / 00 .& i '_m still_awaiting delivery . i informed customer service i still_haven_'_t got my order , to be told to wait 00 days for delivery .,. its not rocket_science the order has_gone_missing as delivery from guernsey is 0_days max . i am a loyal_customer but words_fail me from the lack of interest concerning customer service .
M	hi , delivery a bit late lucky to find someone still there especially as it was a school .
F	i contacted customer_services and haven_'_t had a reply .
M	excellent service , set 0 phones on the monday , received my cheque on thursday .
M	service was great and the progress from confirmation through to dispatch and delivery were great .
F	i '_m going to have to call them back , that '_s three hours of my life i '_ll never get back !
F	good website and prices .
F	£_00 flowers were more like a £ 0 bunch from tesco .
M	slightly_disappointed when trophies arrived , the website doesnt portray how small they are !
F	although advertised on - line and even on the packaging as being the same size the tiles actually differed by 0 - 0mm , thus_making a chequered effect ( as photographed on the website ) impossible !
M	the flight was only 0 / 0 filled , they could have let him on for nothing .
M	tarnishing my experience .
F	very pleased with the excellent customer service , would definitely use this company again .
M	basically , use it as a shop by all means , where you go to it knowing what you want .
F	cool shopping
M	delay in delivery , failure to inform_me .
F	the delivery was quick and the skates perfect .
F	i have just attempted to book a flight with you from phuket to ho_chi minh on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
M	after telling_me that my prescription was out of date and not giving me time to get a new one , they charged me £ 0 . 00 admin_fees and £ 0 . 00 bank charges .
F	i won_'_t be using any other company now .
M	i had a number of bids quickly that were very useful and found the right one for me quickly .
M	have used battery_force for a number of years for a variety of watch , electronic gadget and camera batteries and have found they have a very wide_range available and deliver very quickly at a very reasonable price .
F	another problem is that many of the clothes are one - size only , and mostly suit to a medium to petite frame .
F	cheers
F	extremely upset and frustrated after paying over the odds for a bathroom which hasn_'_t even lasted a year - i have cracked floor_tiles due to poorly installed underfloor_heating , a smashed cup_holder because it wasn_'_t attached to the wall properly , poorly sealed shower_unit , a broken led light_fitting which was supposed to last 00 years !
F	i was really pleased with the beautifully made shawl i bought for my new grandson , so soft .
F	even_though i was told the second driver was included when i booked , this was not the case when we arrived and an additional_charge of euros00 was applied , plus_vat .
F	this all happened on 0th_may and i am still_waiting for the items to be delivered .
F	but this not a real problem .
F	i have been in touch with customer service tonight , so have yet to sort this out .
M	the delivery service was very poor to say the least !
M	i had to close it down and restart to fix it .
F	implying it '_s my fault and my problem .
F	i shall stick with the local_florist in future i '_m afraid .
M	would recommend as received a great price for my i phone 0 that had a few minor_cosmetic scratches
M	no additional garbage was installed as requested , perfect .
F	i contacted when i at first_glance saw items that had perished who where extremely apologetic and sent me an e_- voucher to compensate me .
F	it '_s obviously just a production line with the result being pot_luck , or not , for the customer .
F	i am not impressed and i will not be using this service again to be honest
F	we can thoroughly_recommend the place .
M	the glasses themselves are fine .
M	they did however supply a telephone_number for me to ring , interparcel - 00000_000000 , who gave a helpful , pleasant , and very quick help to my queries .
M	the following wednesday i rang to check they had posted the glasses to me .
M	i immediately contacted iflorist and spoke to a customer_services rep , who could provide no explanation , no satisfactory solution to the problem .
F	excellent , reliable and fast .
F	found this site after using many others , glad i did will_definately use again 0_*
M	ordered two cables late in the day . arrived lunchtime the next_day as_described & well_packaged . a job extremely well_done , totally_satisfied !
F	the website it '_s self is really easy and comfortable to use & found what i was looking for quickly .
F	battery came within 0 - 0_days , and works well in my old cordless_phone !
M	april_00th : received an email_stating that they had recieved stock of the item but the wrong_colour and would i like to swap to a different_colour !
F	first_class service , would definitely recommend and will be using again 😃😃
F	i would reccomend them to everyone .
M	brilliant news for sports car buffs , brilliant threads and opportunities to find out about whatever you need to and a real sense of community .
M	now got x 0 tanks working , oil & financial payback ( fuel reduction due to bulk deliveries in my area ) to use against my next order .
F	there is no customer service - and if you decide to ' escalate your complaint to the ceo '_s office ' - the manner of the manager who eventually telephones you , beggars_belief !
M	actually had to phone them 0 + times before they send me a technician to come check my home line . also they promised me some broadband_speed but they supplied me with 0 . 0mbps which was slower_than my mobile_phone internet from 0 . when im complaint and threatened to cancel my contract and go to another_provider they give me a best offer ever to keeping_me in with refreshing my contract but also try to charge my sky high fee for cancellation when i am gone . so had been forced to stay with them for next year .
M	episode 0 - i bought an ipad on november 00 and received an email_confirming i could pick_up the item at the local_branch after an_hour .
M	when no posters arrived that day , i rang again and spoke to the same lady_who then told me that she had already sent another batch of posters out first_class , as she was concerned_about my first batch not arriving - it was the second_batch that had generated the dispatch note .
M	you need a new courier service .
M	it appears it was packed away in this condition with a broken helmet box since the outer_box was unmarked .
F	thank_you for all your help .
M	so , in one way good ( speed ) and the other way bad ( speed !).
M	a further 00 working_days passed and artstate didn_'_t even respond to me or groupon in that time frame so groupon are now putting the money back on my card , have cancelled the voucher and logged this complaint against them .
M	fyi holidaysautos is a front for cartrawler . com , check their reviews for the real rating .
M	0_weeks appears to be standard for delivery know matter what you want .
F	having finally gotten though to someone , after ten_minutes on hold , all they could do was find out from the florist they had requested the flowers from where they were and then email me back , i felt thoroughly fobbed_off !
F	i never received the camera and i '_m still_waiting for a refund ( 00 sept_0000 ).
M	not only is the range of products huge and varied , but the quality of service provided is excellent .
M	again , cctv showed the driver walk over to the door and walk_away seconds later so i have to assume that he had already written the card out before approaching the house as he only made one journey to the house and had no parcel with him when he did .
F	kept us informed all they way until delivered .
F	prewrapped cheese is a rip - off compared to the cheeses counter .
F	!
F	the pack was received quickly and the money transferred to my account promptly .
F	thats everything they need to steal you identity !!!
F	after chasing for a reply two_days_later i received an_email 0_days after that saying the following .
M	will_definitely be ordering from them again .
F	very easy , very quick n very cheap :-)
F	waited in today for the pick_up of a faulty bike , to find out they hadn_'_t even booked me in .
F	i just felt i still do not know whether i can get a ferry to orknwy or not although i have paid for it .
F	i give up other channels live and catch up streams are far_superior
F	would definitely recommend .
M	in short , they are shite !
F	lose . have raised a case due to non delivery of a purchase . one week on & i '_m still_awaiting a resolution .
F	:)
F	thank_you !
F	that was such a feeble excuse and its absolutely rubbish .
M	do not order from them .
M	charged for goods they did not have .
F	!
M	that was really fast .
M	when i picked_up the bike , the last thing they did was screw the old peddles into the new chain set peddle shafts .
M	oh & guess_what my new months data_allowance was meant to start today !
F	when i sent the books back - i was helped to understand the use of ' aids '
F	great company and thoroughly recommended .
M	the reason_why people find this company useful is when they try to sort_out the lowest_price this company usually pops_up .
F	it was like this all day .
M	best advertised price for what we wanted but an additional compulsory booking_fee of £ 0 . 00 when you get to the end of the process makes it not quite as good as the ad !
M	delayed cash_back nearly 0 months , but they got me the mentioned value , so trust_worthy
F	however , after a week the elastic in the trousers has_gone and the velcro on the belt has come off .
F	they seemed to have lost my email adress the moment after they sent me an_email , and all their promises of contacting me wasn_'_t followed through .
F	i needed the product urgently and feel let_down .
M	god service og_god_pris
F	i wholeheartedly_recommend asos , really great company .
M	thanks again .
M	i have a problem with the veterinary culture in the uk .
M	not sure what the mark up on the face value was but probably substantial .
F	i asked them for ba '_s phone number , they told me they didn_'_t have it .
M	a really friendly company that dealt_with an issue i had with speed and efficiency .
F	i purchased sumatra wall panels early this year , it was the first time that i have used wet wall and used these as they appeared value for money and better made than competitiors .
M	and a iwant a iphone get it lol .
F	iflorist contacted me regarding this matter and said after investigating i was due a full_refund .
F	this is a bit of a nuisance considering i had to spend both days at home between_0am and 0pm to receive the parcel .
F	the villa was everything we had hoped for and more .
F	it had still not arrived past the maximum 00 days stated so i emailed them .
F	the website was very easy to use .
F	am happy with the items that i bought and the delivery service i received .
F	marcus then took my telephone no and said he would speak to the depot to see if it could be delivered on saturday 0 june .
M	out of intrest i sent them an email letting them know i wanted to send my soaking_wet monitor back on friday_morning ( 0nd sept ), and still no response , they will want to courier it back which will take 0 days to arange and a day to take place , at best .
F	the price was the best around and the quality fantastic .
F	it truly is amazing and i am so grateful to my husband who treated me to it .
F	if i ever need another phone unlocked i will do it through them again i recommend this to anyone_needing a phone unlocked !
M	after 0_weeks , we are still_waiting for one part of bed to arrive ( unusable without it ).
F	many_thanks
M	i placed my order on line after a quick telephone_conversation with a very helpful member of the weblogs team .
M	there were no car manual / instructions in the car so i couldn_'_t look up any_problems i had .
F	they came today !
M	if need items in a short_timescale be cautious .
F	!
M	they took_ages to attempt to resolve the problem but were ultimately unsuccessful .
M	i phoned their tech_support ( in mumbai ) who would not listen to me ( i am an ex - college lecturer in pc programming and maintenance and know a bit about how computers work ).
F	all of it .
F	the texts_telling_me of the progress of my order were very reassuring too .
M	so definately not using this depot again !!!
M	i have therefore asked for my order to be cancelled and an immediate_refund be made .
F	you need to arrange alternative_accommodation in glasgow city_centre .
F	i was looking for medication from a site who offered same day despatch and next_day delivery .
F	would it be possible to send the correct lenses ?
M	. bath towels needed binning i hsve better one for my dog . sheets the same . mattress need replacing springs coming through . electric_kettle darn right dangerous leaked everywhere along with the fridge_freezer . outside an accident wsiting to happen if it has not already the tiles are lethal .
M	i use dfds newhaven dieppe because it '_s a good route for my destination in brittany , but there are times it is so expensive that i make alternative travel_plans . the worst thing is that i have friends who work on the ships and say they have the spare capacity . so by being too pricy i know they loose clients . wish they would have a clearer frequent_traveller set_up . at present if you join the frequent_traveller scheme it '_s a lotttery as to if you can get on . it '_s getting to the stage where with friends we are thinking of keeping a spare / or hire car in dieppe and just go over as foot passengers .
M	00am i had found the part on the website and ordered it .
M	there were only two options_available that night .
M	will use them again .
F	highly_recommend to everyone .
F	sent my old_phones on monday and had the money in my account on thursday !
M	i ordered it one day and it came the next brill .
F	hopefully not a sign of things to come !!
M	the end product was wonderful and i would certainly use the service again .
F	i had no idea what was going on .
M	bought this lighter because it has so many uses , tough , reliable , ideal for when i '_m walking in the hills , confident it won_'_t let_me down .
M	small car_hire ( fiat 000h £_000 !
M	before you know your email is clogged with spam_emails .
M	i have since ordered my experian report which already shows my search by orange ( which i arranged through dial a phone ) which was several days after trying cpw but surprisingly no searches showing for cpw / o0 which suggests a credit search was never even carried_out .
M	i would certainly use them again and not_hesitate to recommend them to others .
F	placed intial order for 0 items , delivery 0 - 0 working_days
M	anyway the order was placed i paid the full_amount for my order and i got the goods in the time period expected ,
F	iam not impressed !
M	i ordered friday_night and the package arrived tuesday - not bad !
M	worktop_express is a top site .
M	after_contacting tripsta by e_- mail a few_times , i got a couple of messages saying that " we are still_waiting for the airline '_s contact " and i even got an email with a booking change that should have been sent to another person .
F	the order was processed and delivered as promised with relevant email_updates_regarding delivery .
M	!
F	i have never had to use their customer service until two_weeks_ago when i lost my asdl line .
M	i have used them a number of times and would not_hesitate in recommending tyres on the drive . com
F	:-(
F	i won_'_t be using you again !!!!!
M	worth the time spent doing it ourselves and would use them again .
F	salesman was polite and friendly but the handover to the person_who took the order didn_'_t go smoothly hence above problem .
F	easy to order and arrived within a couple of days .
M	thank_you
M	quick delivery at a very competitive price .
F	i ordered a new coat for my birthday and the wrong one was sent , emailed boohoo and they said my coat wasn_'_t even in stock ??
F	i was not expecting this as the first time i had it done it was clear within a few hours to days .
M	envirofone refused to return my phone and i lost £_00 on their 0000 customer service number trying to sort it out .

F	paypal state that the order needs to be processed by the company . when i enquired_about the order status as i was eager to receive the canvas , the email i received back was offensive in tone , by being very condescending , and assumed the error was the fault of my inability to use a very simplistic ordering process .

M	!
M	this is all i can rate the company on as i haven_'_t received the order yet but very good customer service .

F	this was a good job i checked it as the cat would not have survived taking it .
