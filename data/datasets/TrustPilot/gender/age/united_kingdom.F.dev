0	we recommend it to everyone , fast delivery , work well
0	this website should be the first_port of call for anyone considering emmigrating .
0	it is easy to navigate , yet packs in plenty of detail .
0	the country guides provide a good insight to various destinations and the shipping calculator is a nifty idea .
0	i would happily reccommend this site .
0	i could not fault julesb one bit , firstly on price , keeping_me up to date on the location of my package and then the presentation of my goods .
0	already_recommended julesb to two friends .
0	will always use julesb over other stocklists all because of the ease of this transaction .
0	a refreshing_change with online shopping .
0	thank_you !
0	very pleased with the service at perfume - click , great value , well_packaged and delivered super quick .
0	i placed my order on friday_afternoon and was a little_worried that due to the weekend it '_ll arrive late ( as i needed it for valentines_day ) but to my surprise it arrived monday_morning .
0	i have to say i was happy with the delivery charge too ;)
0	already ive started recommending to friends and family and would definately shop_here again .
0	thanks perfume - click ..... full_marks !
0	i am happy with my purchase from highlandtitles .
0	the items are looking great .
0	good customer service - i had to communicate with the company by email and they answered very quickly .
0	the only_thing is that the next_day delivery is is fact not the next but the second day from the day the item is despatched .
0	however in my case it was not a significant delay , and may be it was more due to post delays rather_than highlandtitles fault ....
0	i have been using website for around 0 . 0 years and i am happy with it .
0	great genuine products at unbeatable prices and free reliable delivery .
0	my order was only lost once ( i made around 00 orders so far ) but cheapsmells sent me replacement item without_any_problems .
0	i am very happy with them so far .
0	great choice of spare details for helicopters and very quick delivery !
0	i had never bought glasses on the internet before but found best0specs on the internet .
0	i couldn_'_t_believe the prices compared with the last pair i bought from vision_express .
0	i placed the order over the phone and they were really helpful .
0	my new glasses arrived about 0_weeks_later and i '_m really delighted with them .
0	i '_ve saved_myself a lot of money .
0	i have used photobox . co . uk a number of times .
0	i used to leave my photos on my laptop but now i print them out at photobox - just like the old days !
0	i '_m on their mailing_list and i got sent some really good offers for free prints .
0	i recently got some photos of my kids put on canvas they really look great .
0	overall i '_m delighted with there service , quality and price
0	i was directed to hostelbookers via a comparison site .
0	hostelbookers had great information on the hotel , as well as photos and reviews .
0	my favourite things about hb though , was that in my confirmation_email they provided information on the best way to get to / from the airport to / from the hostel - which is second to none , we otherwise would have ended_up forking_out for a taxi and paying way over the odds !
0	will definitely be using again !
0	why is your vat ridiculous now and why do you keep on raising my bill .
0	i '_m going to be paying £_00 a month at this rate for a rubbish phone
0	good service , my computer was really fast now used the 0 gig .. good job mr_memory .. :)
0	many_thanks ,
0	cophi
0	i was lucky_enough to find precious_little one online when searching for baby items .
0	lower_than_expected prices , and good communication .
0	my order was placed in the evening thursday_night , and shipped friday_morning .
0	a great sight , and i will definitely use this one again .
0	i had my baby registry at babies r_us in the u . k , and everything was fine with it .
0	we then received a broken item , which we realized was broken when we tried to assemble it the same day it arrived .
0	we called the customer service desk which was useless and a waster of my time .
0	first , i was accused of breaking it myself , even_though it had only been delivered about 00_minutes prior .
0	then i was told i would have to pay to send it back with the company that delivered it .
0	trust me , they got it from me at that point .
0	they finally after pissing and moaning_about it , arranged for pick_up from my house , as the nearest_store is 0 hours away , and i am 0_months pregnant and didn_'_t fancy driving all that way to replace something that was faulty on their behalf .
0	so it was picked_up , and i tracked the delivery .
0	it '_s been over 0_days now and they still_haven_'_t received it in their system , and therefore hasn_'_t been delivered .
0	i phoned and was told i '_d have to wait at_least 0_weeks for the new one , even_though it '_s paid for , and they ' re not losing anything by sending it to me .
0	i '_ve made many complaints to them , but nothing seems to get done .
0	i feel 0_star is even too much for this company , and will never shop or make another registry again with toys_r_us , or babies r_us .
0	awful service , useless customer service helpline , and all around ignorant .
0	sold an ipod in november , they said the money would be in the account by christmas_eve and still have not received the money yet .
0	they also blocked my account for unknown reasons and haven_'_t yet sent me a letter to help me reactivate the account .
0	this was last_year .
0	despite me waiting in all day , my collection did not take place on the date arranged which was disappointing , but the reason i am still scoring 0 is because of the great service i received when i brought this to p0g '_s attention - within minutes , my agent richard_mileham had rebooked my pick_up for the same day that i contacted them ( using a more_expensive service ) - richard was very polite and helpful , so all in all , i am very happy .
0	just a side note , i have used p0g many_times before now , and up until this occasion , there has never been a problem , so can only_assume that this mishap has_been a one - off .
0	i would defo recommend using seranata_flowers to send someone flowers !
0	really quick & reasonably_priced !
0	i like this web_site , because it can offer very good rooms for optimal price .
0	descriptions of hostels and casas are very informative and full .
0	photoes are useful too .
0	very good service internet service is great .
0	come here often .... addicted
0	been using them for a while now and find them a really good service
0	fantastic friendly helpful service , not to mention the ' ahead of trend ' range of sunnies !
0	fast deliveies and a even better after care service ....
0	i '_m a returning_customer time and time again ... wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else !
0	red_hot are arguably the best dealership online !
0	supplement_warehouse provides the best selection of nutrition supplements you can find .
0	the free extras are a super bonus , but i love that they will not only match , but beat a competitor '_s price .
0	my only_complaint would be the added cost to shipping when you select free items , but really it is a small price to pay .
0	the turn_around time is amazing so i never miss a beat .
0	thank_you !
0	had a few things go missing and was resent without_any_problems .
0	really great customer service
0	really great choice of products .
0	bought a few beds and toys and really liked the quality .
0	would recommend buying this brand .
0	i booked yodel through p0g - they are useless and didn_'_t turn_up .
0	i personally think p0g should not use them as a supplier .
0	i used p0g live_chat with samantha - she was fantastic .
0	she change our courier to a ups drop_off service .
0	i will definitely be using p0g again because of samantha '_s help and just pay for a better 0rd_party supplier !
0	it would be useful if p0g had a number you could call - the live_chat was brilliant when i eventually found it though !
0	!
0	lots of choice , lovely products and excellent delivery service !
0	perfect all_round !
0	will definitely be using temptation_gifts again .
0	i was expecting to pay a couple hundred_pounds minimum for a 00 might stay , but thanks to hostelbookers , i am spending less_than 0 hundred total , and still staying in a hostel with reviews over 00 %.
0	reading the reviews themselves is very helpful , because they give different ratings based on what you care about and why they ' re traveling - so if you ' re crashing for the night , access to a lot of showers might not be priority , but a higher safety rating might be .
0	a 00_percent rating on safety is fine if you ' re a 0 ' 0 muscular man , but 00 is perfect when you ' re 0 ' 0 can '_t do a push up without hurting my wrist me .
0	there '_s no booking_fee , so you see what you ' re paying upfront , and the deposit is only 00_percent , so if you have to cancel , it '_s not a major loss .
0	( a night '_s reservation deposit is never more than 0 pounds for me .)
0	i cannot_believe the speed and efficiency in which my order was processesd .
0	it only took a few_days from me sending the fone in to getting my payment .
0	the service is excellent and i will_definately use again .
0	an easy website to use and always quick .
0	great to compare different hotels , hostels and etc .
0	also to compare the locations and prices .
0	its says how many places are left so you know how long you can wait or think about it .
0	bought a snugpak sleeping_bag , as the title describes !
0	sent out the envelope very quickly , received my phone and notified me even quicker and paid the money into my account the same day - excellent .
0	good quality and arrived within a few_days accurate sizes to
0	my outfit came within a matter if days and is of a really good quality
0	will_defo use this site again
0	the item arrived within a couple of days and was of a very good quality .
0	i was also kept up to date as to when my item was dispatched and when it would arrive .
0	i also found the prices to be excellent .
0	i wrote an earlier , rather negative_review based entirely on the fact that i hadn_'_t received my order after 0_weeks .
0	however , this was down to the post_office either not delivering it or delivering the card to the wrong_address .
0	when i contacted peak_nutrition , they were quick to respond , polite and extremely_helpful .
0	despite the fact that it wasn_'_t their fault that i hadn_'_t received the order , they were happy to send out a repeat order without_any fuss and were extremely_helpful .
0	i have now received my supplements which were perfectly packaged and all as they should be .
0	i would definitely order from peak_nutrition again as i would be confident that they would help sort_out any_problems if there were any .
0	i would also advise that you ask for recorded delivery as the post_office can be terribly unreliable !
0	thanks , i am very satisfied for your services .
0	quality products and fast delivery .
0	recommand to all this site .
0	best regards
0	lilian
0	i first liked hostelbookers . com because of their blog and regularly_updated twitter account but using them to book my stay for a busy_period ( rio_de janeiro carnival ) proved - with a lot of price comparing - that they have the cheapest rates and really are the only site without booking_fees .
0	i was very impressed and would definitely use them again .
0	so i was a little_nervous_about recycling my ipad 0 with ipad_recycle but after_reading the reviews and doing some_research i decided to give it a go !
0	i posted my ipad monday_afternoon special delivery and i received a conformation_email from euan saying that they got my package tuesday_morning and they will transfer my money later that day .
0	you cant ask for better service and i am very pleased that i chose ipad_recycle .
0	i will totally be recommending this company to my friends and family .
0	thanks again :)
0	really easy website to use , great prices , great options .
0	would definitely use again !
0	i love muubaa , not that i can shop there regularly !
0	but the two times i have they have been perfect .
0	it '_s a big deal to buy luxury leather_jackets online when you can '_t try them on .
0	but muubaa understand this and make the process so easy and pleasant if you need to swap a size or return etc .
0	but most of all , the jackets are the softest leather i have ever felt ... and so comfortable and stylish .
0	worth ever penny .
0	my family and i have used buy wise for many things , from washing_machines to mattresses , and have been more than happy every time .
0	will carry on going back for much more in the future .
0	thank_you !
0	gadget_panda were communicative , efficient and did exactly_what they said they would .
0	i chose to get payment by bank_transfer and it showed up two_days after they received my phone .
0	all in all , i would definitely use them again and highly_recommend them !
0	this course was so easy to access and complete , everything is given to you and you don_'_t need to search for materials .
0	there are videos as well as written units so if you learn best through either option , they are both presented to you and easy to use !
0	the course is set at your_own_pace so you can fit it around family , friends , work and even university !
0	i did not know i could_learn so much in such a short time frame , and i thought i might struggle with the technology but it was all set out and explained in a way that i could easily complete all of the tasks !
0	i recommend you try this company if this a course you are interested in studying !
0	i never_heard of xskins before but seeing the design i was after on their website i thought i would take the risk and order .
0	really glad that i did service was quick and perfect , no_issues with product upon delivery and it turned_out being exactly how i hoped .
0	would definately order from here again !
0	being somewhat of a penny pincher i always check multiple websites for the best rates and hostelbookers . com has never let_me down !
0	the website has a beautiful layout that is extremely simple to use but jam packed with excellent search features .
0	booking the hostel was extremely fast and painless and literally took less_than a minute .
0	i '_ll be going to hostelbooker . com to book the rest of my hostels for my backpacking_trip through europe , thank_you !
0	i will definitely be using double0 again !
0	kept up to date right throughout the process from purchase to delivery and on top of that they gave_us an upgrade to our seats for the one direction concert at no extra_cost !
0	fantastic little surprise when we opened our tickets !
0	i '_d recommend them to anyone looking to book !
0	item was dispatched quickly and i received the items far quicker_than the time stated .
0	very pleased and would order again .
0	again like many others i bought from them , money has_been taken and they have not sent the item .
0	i have tried to contact them and you hear nothing .
0	my 0 year_old_son is now without his present , regret ordering from them .
0	i had no_problems with this company received item quickly and with no_hiccups to deal with .
0	great service
0	good company and quick nomally free delivery
0	great website and prices
0	yodel is by far the most useless courier firm i have ever come_across .
0	shower of excrement doesn_'_t even begin to cover it .
0	i would give them no stars but unfortunately that isn_'_t an option .
0	i ordered some boots and to be fair they tried to deliver them 0 times ; all within the same hour each day .
0	sort of like banging your head against a wall and expecting an outcome to pain .
0	the driver , who texted me his mobile number seemed unable to work his mobile , either to answer it or pick_up his messages .
0	did he think i was calling for a friendly chat ???
0	the call_centre staff are nice ( except the last one , who just sounded_bored to tears but then i can '_t really blame her ) but despite message after message left with them were unable to let the driver know ( which a 0 year_old could probably work out after 0 failed tries ) that since they deliver between_0am and 0pm , perhaps they could try any other time other than the 0pm hour .
0	bored girl informed me that they have a set route and even_though their only job is to deliver parcels and they must have known this would not be fulfilled , they won_'_t change the time .
0	so basically their delivery times in my area are from 0pm to 0 . 00pm !?!
0	yeah , really handy .
0	cheers for that .
0	so in work on monday i '_ll try to get_hold of someone on the phone and get no answer .
0	then on tuesday i '_ll call at the same time and get no answer .
0	i '_ll repeat this 0 more times , leaving my number but never answer their calls .
0	i haven_'_t done my job but the boxes are ticked .
0	bottom line : if you want a lot of cards through your door , order with a company that uses_yodel but if you want a parcel , forget it .
0	i made the first payment to tt on the 00th_december .
0	until now i still don_'_t have a broadband / internet_connection .
0	i called every week since december and i think i spoke at_least once with every_single person that works in customer service / fault department / cancellation departments .
0	i had a visit from an engineer everything is fine inside the house and with the modem , oh , it was the bt guys who didn_'_t activate the line from outside .
0	they will come on tuesday .
0	not sure if they came or not but still no internet for 0_weeks .
0	called again for around 00_minutes , did all the line testing that i already do with my eyes_closed .
0	swith on , swith off , change socked , open the socket , flip the modem , dance samba with modem , everytime the same expertly advised procedures .
0	oh , you stay home from work from 0 to 0 ( thats not vague at all ) and a bt_engineer will visit you .
0	never showed up .
0	called again - 00_minutes .
0	oh , no the problem is with the exchange .
0	bt is fixing it , i promise with my life and soul i will call you in 0_days .
0	until now .
0	called again today , i want to cancel the contract .
0	another round of testing for 00_minutes ( took a nap while doing them ) and now , no_faults anywhere , dont_know , let_me send you another engineer ( lucky me , there is one available in 0_weeks time !)
0	no , i want to cancel , thank_you .
0	let_me direct you to the cancellation department .
0	0 minutes on hold .. tcha nam ...
0	i someone hangs up the phone in my face .
0	after going to hell and back , called the cancellation department .... 00_minutes with a broked connection ... oh let_me direct you to the faults department .
0	what ?!
0	they directed me to you .
0	after 00_minutes on hold ... fault department , another round of line testing !!!
0	nothing wrong , do you want an enginneer in 0_weeks time ?
0	no , thank_you , just want to cancel the contract - sorry ma ' am , cancellation department closes at 0pm .... its 0 . 00pm .
0	guess i dont need to say anything_else ....
0	i think lastminute . com not only have some awesome deals , but they are really helpful on the other end of the phone .
0	i was booking my first holiday by myself so had no clue what i was doing , luckily i had a great guy , named ricky , helping_me out all the way !
0	so , yea , i definitely recommend them !
0	great service , and even better if you ask to speak to ricky .
0	haha
0	bought a raleigh swift folding bike , halfords have the best bargains for bikes and if there are any_problems you can always take it to the shop for service .
0	they have several delivery options including_saturdays .
0	the bike folds up so that i can carry it up to my flat on the third floor without_any difficulty .
0	i '_m pleased with the price and benefits of having the bike .
0	bought an extra hard_disk drive for our main computer at home ( western digital 0tb hard_disk drive ).
0	it '_s mainly for storing films and music .
0	the order arrived within four days which is good .
0	it also installed into the computer ok and was recognized by windows .
0	all - in - all a hassle - free purchase
0	i bought a beto mountain_bike shock pump gauge & bleed valve mp000 for my husband a week_ago .

0	the recommended retail price is £_00 . 00 so this is very good .
0	bought a pre_- pay sim from vodafone . co . uk for my daughter .
0	arrived quickly and was easy to setup and use .
0	also very good value for money , unlimited_calls for less_than $_00 . 00 per_month or just pay as you go .
0	bought a proline pl000wd which is a standard size larder_fridge instead of a wine_cooler , the fridge was £_000 . 00 which is more than half the price of a similar size wine_cooler .
0	this is our second fridge which we will use for beer and wine .
0	delivery was quick and the website has good size pictures so i new exactly_what i was buying .
0	the fridge arrived undamaged and works_fine .
0	well_done comet !

0	emily howell
0	ordered a set of polo_shirts for our staff and delighted with the finished products .
0	they came quickly and i would have no_reservations_about recommending workwear_express to other_companies .

0	our beautiful new furniture arrived today .
0	it is exactly as_described on the website and just what i wanted .
0	unfortunately the delivery men struggled to get the chest of drawers upstairs for us and gave up leaving it in the centre of our living_room where we hoped to sleep tonight whilst the bedroom is being finished !
0	within 00 seconds of them leaving my husband measured the gap ( took the drawers out to make it lighter - not sure why the delivery guys didn_'_t want to do this !)
0	and we had it upstairs in no time .
0	unfortunately they had already put 0 dents in my lovely new furniture when i pointed_out the dents the driver was very weary in his voice and stated he could ring the office but then they would have to take it away and rearrange - but since all our other furniture has already been disposed of i had little choice but to keep it dents and all .
0	so overall lovely product and i would use the company again but i '_ll be moving the furniture myself thanks !
0	i bought a voucher for my web master course from groupon site .
0	so i redeemed the voucher on e_- careers web_site and this is how my study has begun .
0	the course is well_structured , it covers not just main topics like html , xml , php , etc_., but contains a lot of material how to manage your online business as well .
0	in other words it has almost everything that every web master ( not just beginner !)
0	needs to know .
0	i would like to say that course really worth it , i have learned a lot new stuff and i really enjoyed it .
0	and i would definitely recommend e_- careers not just for my friends but for anyone who is interested in good quality learning .

0	i ordered a t - shirt in the evening , they posted it the next_day , it arrived the day after that .
0	my t - shirt was a good fit and very funny , the best t - shirt i '_ve ever bought i think .
0	there is nothing about truffle_shuffle i could complain_about .
0	also they sent me sweeties in my package .
0	i sent in my ipad yesterday via special delivery next_day .
0	i was emailed this morning to say it had been received , then lunch_time to say it had been checked , then this afternoon to say they had paid me .
0	i checked my bank_account and the money is there already .
0	it literally took 00_hours to send my ipad and get paid for it .
0	i cannot_fault them , and i will definitely use them again .
0	i '_m a little_bit in shock , to be honest .
0	i didn_'_t think you could get service like this .
0	wow why did i not find this website sooner before i wasted so much money on store bought products ??
0	im a pregnancy testaholic so these are so beneficial for me .
0	lets_hope i dont need them all !
0	!
0	delivery was really quick too , i would definately use them again and would highly_recommend to people trying to conceive .

0	courses covered all content required along with additional content , not expected .
0	very pleased .
0	i created a photobook as a christmas_present and was very impressed with the ability to create the book offline where the programme linked to the pictures folder on my computer and displayed thumbnails allowing me to put the book together easily .
0	i was impressed with the easiness of use and the variations of layout i could have on each page .
0	at the end of the process the system asked me to proof the book which i thought i had done but then it flagged_up an empty photo box on a page that i would have otherwise have missed and would have been obvious once printed so great save there , especially after i '_d ticked a box to say i had proofed it and was happy with it !
0	once i had finished the book it was uploaded to the website and i was able to track the progress through printing , binding and eventually posting where it arrived 0_days_later .
0	would have no_hesitation_recommending to friends and family and came back on tonight to order something_else .
0	extremely impressed .
0	never had a problem and appreciate the past customer discounts , excellent !
0	prices are always very competitive but past customer offers are unbeatable !
0	a good mobile casino , easy access to your account , game lobby etc .
0	easy to contact customer support if needed .
0	casino would how ever benefit from afew more games to choose from .
0	great service , cheap prices , very fast delivery with great communication via emails to let_me know the processing .
0	after struggling to find a calling_card with high_quality calls to pakistan someone suggested a tried digital calling cards .

0	i looked up on google the best hostel near the full moon party and it came up with hostelbookers first .
0	i searched for dates and it came up with all the hostels available on those dates .
0	those hostels came with prices , making it so easy for me to see what was the cheapest and what was recommended by others .
0	very easy service and quick payment so i don_'_t waste anytime .
0	brilliant !
0	when i entered the world of poker for the first time , online play was relatively new for me .
0	the veteran players i met laughed when i told them that not only had my first hand played online , but my childhood was spent at poker the virtual field and of course games for kids online .
0	in fact , it was not until having spent_hundreds of hours playing online poker that i felt comfortable enough to go to a casino on land and sit with other human_beings , totally vulnerable to their intimidating looks and talks on the table .
0	although i found intriguing live poker , the convenience of playing online as i struggled to keep_up and the number of websites which offer strategies and tips for poker players is correspondingly large and growing .
0	here in winner . com i have found a great and comfortable place for playing and meeting nice people , you have great info , great games for playing online and getting some nice tips for poker .
0	please keep updating your site , and keep bringing great stuff like you do , you already have a fan here .
0	congrats and greetings !
0	i appreciate the 0 %_off competitors ' prices on any product .
0	i '_m not aware of any other supplement company that offers that benefit .
0	also , the free return shipping is wonderful .
0	i wish all companies did that ( like many shoe retailers do , since you have to try things on for size .
0	the same is true for suppelements ).
0	with every other website i '_ve tried my iphone never completely stays unlocked but with official_iphone_unlock now it '_s locked for good !
0	i will definitely recommend this to all of my friends to use with their iphones !

0	hubby needed new glasses and as we were getting depressed with paying out £_000 for his prescription ( very bad_eyesight ), thought we would give glasses 0 you a try as the glasses hubby liked were a quarter of the price .
0	i dont normally_bother_writing_reviews , but have to say that the service that we received from russ at glasses 0 you was fantastic , and were over the moon with the finished_product .
0	the glasses are slightly_thicker than what he has purchased in the past from a high_street store , but that could be down to the frame and tbh is not noticable at all unless you really look .
0	would recommend to anyone to use glasse 0 you
0	andrew from cateredchalets is awesome - such a nice dude .
0	we changed our party size from 0 to 0 to 0 to 0 to 0 then back to 0 , and everytime he was more than happy to get yet another quote up , work out how it would be cheapest and best value for money .
0	i asked soooo many questions and he answerd them all
0	about gluten_free dietry requirements , vegetarian , whether the chalet has unlimited wine ( yeah im a student )
0	bookig was a breeze , cheers_guys :)
0	after ordering my first purchase with beauty - bay a couple of months_ago , it '_s now my first point if call for any beauty product .

0	my partner brought me a pair of shoes from " new look " on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
0	he had also paid_extra for next_day delivery !
0	i was very excited , so we both decided to stay in and wait for them .
0	they were due to arrive between_0am and 0pm today ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ).
0	i checked the " hermes : parcel tracking " only to find that at
0	" 00 / 00 /_0000 00 : 00 courier to re - attempt "
0	i went straight to the letter_box and no card had been left .
0	we got on to the phone to new look and they told us we had missed the courier , but how could we ?
0	we have been in all day !!
0	i new look wont even refund us delivery charge as we are supposedly the ones at fault .
0	i am very angry and appalled at the way we have been treated and i hope never to do_business with these couriers again once i finally receive my shoes !
0	quick and easy to use .
0	what a time saver :_d
0	i '_ve been playing since 0000 .
0	i '_ve made so many great friends on this site .
0	i love browsing the forums as well as using the client .
0	imvu has come along way since i first joined .
0	its a brilliant boredom killer .
0	kloe @ imvu .
0	i love play . com
0	i bought all my christmas_presents from them and received them all within 0_days of ordering .
0	their products are a great quality and value .
0	never been disappointed .
0	i always buy from them on a regular_basis .
0	i upgraded to a new phone with o0 unaware that they were using yodel as their courier service .
0	naturally i was excited .
0	00 / 00 / 00 - i got a text from o0 stating i would receive my phone this day between_0am and 0pm .
0	all day i waited and waited for my phone to be delivered .
0	at 00 : 00 i got another text from o0 saying i had missed the delivery , i looked at the online tracker and it said " no one to receive card left " at 00 : 00 .
0	i looked for a card and there wasn_'_t one .
0	i called the courier straight_away and told them i '_ve been in all day and missed a days work , so it would of been impossible for me to of missed them .
0	the courier said " oh i '_m new to this round , and i don_'_t know the area , so i didn_'_t come ".
0	what a joke !
0	its your job ?
0	what kind of excuse is that ?
0	" erm i '_ll do it tomorrow " they spoke to me with no respect what so ever .
0	can '_t_believe they didn_'_t even have the courtesy to call me and let_me know what was going on .
0	well thanks for your blatant incompetence !
0	you might be a slacker but i '_m not , another day thats going to be wasted !
0	00 / 00 / 00 - when i checked the tracker early this morning , i noticed that my phone wasn_'_t actually anywhere , i had no idea where it was .
0	i repeatedly tried to contact the courier with no luck .
0	eventually i got tired and gave o0 a call .
0	all of a sudden the courier text me saying they would deliver between 00pm and 0pm .
0	they did turn_up with my phone at 00 : 00 , it was a relief .
0	although the courier was polite when she arrived , i found the whole_experience very stressful and i hope to avoid this company in the future .
0	i will be going to watchdog .
0	on the upside , i love my new phone .
0	i ordered my dress from vponsale on the 00th_september , and it actually arrived today .
0	i was a little_nervous when i ordered my dress after i read some bad_reviews .
0	thankfully my dress is 000_% perfect !
0	it fits like a glove , although it is a tiny_bit long .
0	other than that its fantastic , its great quality and looks like a lot of care went into making it .
0	i can '_t fault this dress , i '_m so happy with it .
0	i just hope i do it justice when i wear it to my first ball :)
0	the customer_services was also very helpful .
0	thank_you vponsale .

0	never a disappointment
0	proper impressed
0	great place to easily compare_prices and reviews , payments very easy
0	great company - we arrived earlier_than arranged and they were there to meet us .
0	highly_recommend .
0	we really enjoyed our time at dixos from the moment we arrived .
0	there is artwork everywhere and great attention to detail in the decor .
0	as a couple , we had a private_room with a balcony and the bathrooms were always quiet so it felt like a hotel , but nicer and more_homely .
0	it is quite a popular hostel and the other_travellers were very friendly and talkative - good atmosphere .
0	the staff are very helpful and recommended some great nearby restaurants - a casual one for lunch ( churrasqueira do infante ) and o mercado for a nice evening_meal - both were very good .
0	it is very near the river - great for a stroll , coffee or trips to the port houses ( a must whilst in porto !
0	).
0	really good product ranges and much_cheaper_than the shops , even with postage taken into account .
0	product arrived quickly and as_described .
0	can '_t fault it !
0	searched for fairtrade flowers and came on arena flowers .
0	ordered 0 bouquets for relatives .
0	website has very clear photos and it was easy to select seasonal flowers .
0	i really liked the add on options at each_stage - deluxe_bouquet , vase , good range of beautiful gifts , cards and even a glossy photo .
0	fastest way to assemble a personalised gift package at a very reasonable_price .
0	0_days mega
0	would not_hesitate in recommending .
0	excellent selection of sweets at a very competitive price .
0	excellent , very responsive customer service .
0	frank answered all my questions and sent me the tracking_details for my parcel which arrived very quickly and great care had been taken in the packaging so in excellent condition .
0	the only_reservation i have is whether i can not eat them before the party ...=)
0	ps0 disc reader fixed within an_hour !!
0	!
0	it took 0 & 0 / 0_weeks for my products to arrive althought i think this was due to the mail & not beautycow & i didn_'_t receive my free mascara , i will still be shopping with this site but a bit dissapointed .
0	i have got so many of my friends and family changing their everyday products which contain so many unrecognizable chemical ingredients in them to lush products .
0	it cuts_down on the high concentration of chemicals within the body and helps the environment not only with less packaging but with great advise and help to recycle what little packaging you do use in the process .
0	i am so glad there is a shop like lush that has many branches widespread over the uk as there aren_'_t many companies that are eco_friendly and use natural products as well as working towards increasing awareness of issues and ethics across the world .
0	i was thoroughly impressed by the speedy delivery of the paper_work and their complete efficiency in dealing_with the whole_process .
0	i thoroughly_recommend them .
0	i tried a different company as they were offering more money than mazuma , but it turns_out that mpx is a big scam and i would advise everyone to steer_clear of them and trust mazuma over other_companies false claims to be better_than them .
0	very reliable service .
0	bought the yoda outfit for my son .
0	he_loves it !
0	plenty of room so he '_ll get loads of wear out of it .
0	fantsatic service .
0	there was a slight fault with the box that the watch come in , possibly caused in transit .
0	as it was a present i rang the company and left a message .
0	they rang me back first thing the next_morning and that day sent me a new box .
0	very helpful .
0	the product is great .
0	would definitely order from this company again .
0	and by liking them on facebook i received a further £ 0 off !
0	i been using collect_plus many_times as ebay_seller , they have really good prices and so many shops around where you can drop your parcel even after work .
0	tracking_system is amazing too , you don_'_t need to worry what '_s going on .
0	i think the score is so low because people who had good experience usually don_'_t come to write a good comments but people who had bad_experience coming here to complain straight_away , that '_s why there are so many negative_reviews .
0	once again i think it '_s the best delivery service and i am very happy that they are here .
0	great service , easy to understand .
0	and everything laid_out so you can see exactly_what '_s what .
0	love the catwalk feature - brilliant !
0	i '_ve_used liberette for a few_years_now .
0	it '_s not a real_mccoy clothes site .
0	it '_s about gaining the best immitation item you can find at a lower price ..
0	i accept that .
0	yes , their sizes are quite small .
0	i do wish they ` d get bigger_sizes in ..
0	i '_d buy from them much more if they did .
0	they have seals on their items which means if you break it you can '_t return it which i think is silly as well .
0	good for underwear but useless on one size items and stretchy items .
0	we need to try cloths on its a simple fact of purchasing .
0	in all .. cheap , cheerful and quick delivery .
0	some quality compromised for a lower price .
0	just don_'_t break that seal !
0	!
0	saw the outfit i wanted ... a smiffys spider web dress !
0	ordered it right away .
0	they kept in touch with me about delivery and it '_s whereabouts throughout it being sent .
0	i could track it all the way .
0	it arrived 0_days_later , on time , and in a nice clean packet in my letter_box .
0	tried it on and it was true to its sizing .
0	looked great i got many_compliments .
0	very happy with the service and price = )
0	never had any_problems or troubles ever .
0	very good .
0	fast payment through the post and very reasonable_price :)
0	i have contacted the winerist for organising a short personalised trip for a group of 0 people in one of the wine regions of france .
0	in the beggining we asked for a wine tour with an accent on architecture , as we wanted to see as many chateaux as possible in 0_days .
0	tatiana recommended the loire valley and we loved it .
0	everything was very well_organised , we followed all of their advise and were 000_% satisfied .
0	tatiana was great
0	i use transferwise monthly to move my pension from uk sterling to euros in cyprus and it '_s easy to do on line with the money arriving in 0_days .
0	great .
0	easy trasaction , free next_day delivery and 0euro better_than the post_office .
0	excellent service and will be even easier next time now details are logged in .
0	i was a little_worried_about spending nearly_£_000 with a company that i had never_heard of .
0	i read a few of the reviews and decided to go with them .
0	i ordered the item at 00pm on tuesday , they phoned me wednesday to confirm the postcode and it had been delivered by thursday , this is incredible given that it came from hong_kong .
0	the item was cheaper_than all the other_companies we had looked into .
0	we got a bundle including cleaning_kit , memory_card and a tripod for cheaper_than the price of amazon , comet etc .
0	the only_thing i would say is that when we turned the camera on the language wasnt set to english , so we had to download the manual ( the hard_copy wasnt english either ) to figure_out how to change it .
0	i would 000_% recommend this company , they are fantastic !
0	!
0	sam was a pleasure working with and when i accidentally provided the wrong number he helped_me correct the mistake and get the funds transferred quick !
0	i bought tickets to monty python at the o0 a few_days before the show .
0	seatwave was ideal as they offered a collection service right next to the o0 , which is great when you are buying at short_notice or are worried_about receiving tickets in time .
0	if this hadn_'_t been offered i probably_wouldn_'_t have been able to go as i would have been too worried_about the tickets not arriving in time .
0	after_reading some negative_reviews of seatwave i was really worried that the tickets would not be there , or would be fake , as had happened to some people .
0	however this was completely_unfounded - i collected the tickets from the collection_point with no_issues , there were no queues and the person working there was extremely friendly and polite .
0	based on my experience i would recommend that seatwave are a safe and reliable_source of tickets .
0	i '_m really glad i used them and would do so again .
0	ps monty python were also amazing !
0	i '_ve been using topcashback for about a year , and it '_s been fantastic .
0	i was a bit_sceptical at first about getting cashback for nothing , but now i never buy or do anything online without checking it first .
0	i '_ve earnt about £_000 so far , just for shopping for things i was going to buy anyway , or using things like their car insurance search_engine ( which i '_ve actually found to be one of the best for finding me the cheapest quotes ).
0	even if you don_'_t shop online very much , just using it for essentials or one - offs like car or home insurance , buying phones , booking holidays etc , get '_s you so much money back .
0	i think everyone should be on it , there '_s literally no reason not to be !
0	... like i did .
0	my husband and i planned a trip and spent 0 hours on this website .
0	there are so many hostels , hotels , b_& bs , etc .
0	on this site with all the information you want and need .
0	i loved the map_feature so we could see which hostel was closest to where we wanted to be .
0	combine that with the ability to set a price range and filter out low - rated places we found the perfect place for us quickly .
0	but that didn_'_t stop us from browsing around at other great deals and hotels way out of our price range .
0	i '_ll definitely use this site again .
0	like the price and we got a free gift !
0	now a repeat customer !
0	i would highly_recommend this company to anyone looking to build a system for high performance at competitive_prices .
0	i got all that i wanted within my budget and i am pleased with the system .
0	i also got next_day delivery free of charge which i was very pleased about and was also happy that i received a phone_call telling_me that my system was ready and when i could expect it to arrive .
0	excellent service , would definitely use again .
0	thank_you ginger0 .
0	excellent flight .
0	great staff
0	great chioce , good advice
0	value for money .
0	great staff
0	great advice in shop , patience and good services over the phone
0	excellent company .
0	quick delivery , had no_problems_whatsoever .
0	highly_recommend to everyone .
0	found the link to their website through trivago listed at £_00 .
0	the link let_me click " book " and enter all my details .
0	then_proceeded to tell me the room was gone ( twin was showing as 0 available and double had " green " availability ) and when i ran another search the room was available again , this time at £_000 .
0	look on their facebook_page and many have had trouble with hotels not having the reservation or them taking money twice from their account .
0	stay away !
0	fantastic service , glasses are at great value and was very easy to order .
0	delivery was quick , packaging was good , product was enjoyed !
0	the pass is amazing .
0	you can go to loads of sites around london using the pass and most of the time we didn_'_t have to queue .
0	however , i would recommend doing your homework first and writing an itinery of the places you want to see as once the card is activated , no matter what time of day , that is classed_as your first day and then its consecutive .
0	the guide book you get with it is great .
0	i loved the card so much that i have bought the parispass as that is our city_break this year .
0	i was really impressed with private_kilimanjaro from_start to finish .
0	from meeting the lead guide at the hotel right to way through the climb , all the team were professional , encouraging and helpful with anything that was causing you a problem .
0	they ensured they did everthing possible to make the whole_experience as enjoyable as possible - passing our water_bottles , adjusting our rucksacs to make_sure they fitted_perfectly and motivating us when we started to suffer .
0	they made sure our group walked together , setting a comfortable and realistic ' pole pole ' pace , this was great for morale and enabled_us to get the know each other better and therefore be there for each other on the final day .
0	the whole team , including the porters , chef and guides were polite and smiled all the way through .
0	the porters worked tirelessly and deserve so much credit .
0	the food was always tasty , so even when your appetite started to go with the altitude you could always manage something .
0	they even went out of their way to cook extra chips , which had gone down a huge_success !
0	after summiting we were met half way back to the camp by the waiters with orange_juice .
0	just a small thing but this ment so much to all the group after the last few hours .
0	as we walked we saw other groups who '_s guide was well ahead of them and people struggling with an injury .
0	the guides with private_kilimanjaro were with us every_step of the way and supported us physically and mentally .
0	our lead guide didn_'_t bombard us with information , but discussed what was needed at the right time enabling_us to enjoy the moments on the mountain .
0	every day had challenges but the whole team worked together so well these challenges seemed so much_easier .... so many amazing memories to take home with me thank_you so much to everyone at private kilimajaro for giving me the best experience !
0	bought 0 doors on 00st_october which were delivered on 0th_november - 0 of which were fine .
0	however , one door was damaged in transit on one corner and the same door was faulty on another corner with part of the door not glued up properly .
0	door - deals are refusing to repair the damage or replace the door !!
0	!
0	bought a pair of glasses including date and time of ordering transaction date : 0000 - 00 - 00 00 : 00 : 00 , i was contacted twice for sending my id documentation , when i did after i recieved only 0 email_saying i should recieve my item within 00 to 00 days but now its months gone and havent_recieved anything .... stay away from these fraudesters and rippers , never recommended simply if they dont get back within 00_hrs than i will be contacting my bank and send chargeback ..
0	always find my best deals on flights , hotels and services .
0	very convenient and well priced .
0	when in ny , for four months tried to top up and every time calling 000 freenumber , got the same message " have not enough founds to connect my call ", for four months calling the company to resolve this issue and nothing was ever done .
0	the roaming rates are outrageous .
0	i am_currently searching for another company to join .
0	the worst experience of the service and money value !
0	march 00th i have placed an order , same day delivery for march 00th , my mom '_s birthday , so i have chosen deluxe flower_arrangement , item called " gorgeous ", paid 00 £ at checkout .
0	delivered bouquet was not at any closer look , then the one they advertise .
0	it was a bunch of green with occasional tiny heads of a complete different flowers .
0	also , the roses were not fresh and today all came off already .
0	i did write to their company support email , because is the only florist company which does not provide a phone line , so if something_goes_wrong , like in my situation , the only you can relay on is their email , they don_'_t even care to check , as this morning the only answer to my emails of complain i got was this survey , asking for satisfactory review and five_star rate .
0	this company is not to trust .
0	by the way , i managed to buy some extra flowers at the wild heart , at liberty '_s and coated me 00 £ - gorgeous huge flower_arrangement !
0	!
0	i spoke to the policy store to get advice and everyone there was so helpful and friendly .
0	we ordered personalised thank_you cards for my son '_s first birthday .
0	they are lovely .
0	ordered the item on the thursday and was delivered on the friday of the next_day !!!
0	i had one very happy little_boy !
0	would most definitely use again !
0	and the item purchased was £ 0 cheaper_than other_retailers in the high_street !
0	and £ 0 cheaper_than amazon with faster shipping .
0	a trusted_seller
0	disgusted with bt , over the passed 00 years we have had times when bt had to supply our telephone line and they have made our lives hell every since !
0	00 years_ago i moved in with my partner who decided that we needed a telephone and internet access , we had everything plumbed in so to speak and off the line went no_issues until we got a bill for over_£_000 , it included a line fitting which we shouldn_'_t have paid and telephone_calls to numbers that we had never_heard of ... bt would not back down that the numbers were nothing to do with us and we had to pay the bill which took over 0 years !!!
0	to sort_out , we then left bt ...... 0 years later we moved_into our current property , there was a telephone line here that bt stated was not in use , they came in and re - connected it ...
0	it didn_'_t work , they then said that there was not a line to the property and connected a new one giving us a new area code ( which we told them was not in our area ), this line did not work it was the wrong area code !!!
0	omg suprise_suprise !
0	they then came in a did loads of checks and told us that we had changed something in the house that had corrupted the line !!! what !!
0	!, they proceeded to fix it and gave_us another telephone_number , guess_what wrong area code !
0	we had all the lines dissconnected as none of them were actually fed to our house ... ( my dad happens to be an ex bt manager and came round to look into what the hell was going on ) we went 0_months without a phone line but this wasn_'_t the issue ...
0	i will_continue ....
0	finally we managed to get them to connect to our local sub station giving us the correct area code , yay we had a phone line !
0	after a month of using it the phone started to crackle and pop while we were on it , the internet was intermittent and to be honest it wasnt worth us having it , then we started getting bills for the dissconnected numbers and charges for call outs and dissconnection charges ... of course i went up the wall at them and everytime i phoned i got the line ' we are sorry for inconvenience_caused ' you guessed it foreign call_centres !
0	they didnt have a clue why i was complaining , they couldn_'_t sort_out the bills and worse of all couldn_'_t sort_out the line issues as there wasn_'_t one apparantly this went on for a whole year until our contract finally expired and we were able to change supplier .
0	as soon as we changed we got another bill telling us we had cancelled our contract early and owed a total of over_£_000 to bt for usage and dissconnection ..... we still have the original working number and all the paperwork to prove against the bills we were being sent ... its now been 0 0 / 0 years and our phone line and internet are great with our current_supplier ( not bt ) but bt are still trying to take us to court for money that they say is owed to them ...
0	review closure .....
0	complete incompetent staff from the call_centre to the engineers , they have no clue what they are doing and pass the buck on to their customers !!!
0	!
0	never again will i use them for anything !
0	after years of chopping and changing supermarkets finally finding one that does everything it says on the tin has_been difficult .
0	sainsbury '_s is the closest one to that mark , the online ordering and delivery service is 00_% foolproof , although i do find i have to switch off the substitutes as some of the replacements are questionable .
0	delivery is always on time , the driver is polite and understanding , and they take a number of cards including electron and solo !!!
0	which is a bonus for most people ( unlike tesco !)
0	products are not always the cheapest however are great quality and easily replacable if they do not meet my standards .
0	the nectar_card is great ...
0	i use it everywhere i go and it saves me a fortune over the year ( last_year over_£_00 just over a weeks shopping ) sainsbury '_s has an easy layout of products allowing you to just pop in and grab or spend an_hour doing the weekly_shop , i do find i spend time wandering_around the home section though spending more money than i needed to and buying items that i don_'_t actually need , its very clever the way the layout is in sainsbury '_s !
0	( or i have no self control lol ) staff are always friendly and helpful and seem to have gone_through a reasonable level of training .
0	the scan as you shop gadgets are fab , it makes sure you don_'_t go over budget on your shop , the only annoying part is when you get up to the till and have to have a re - scan !
0	although you can help yourself here , make_sure you scan everything that goes in your trolley or basket , the more sainsbury '_s can_trust you with your shopping the less likely you will get re - scans !
0	i would also like to point out in this review that i have a disabled relative who also uses sainsbury '_s in a number of stores across the country ( mainly as i live in essex and she is in shropshire ) we have never had an issue borrowing any form of wheelchair or acquiring goods from the top shelf at any of the 0 stores we regularly use , they also have ramps for the cash machines and a lower machine for wheelchair access .
0	all in all a great all_round supermarket !
0	we have been purchasing items from 0000rpm for the last 0 years .
0	our small business relies on fast shipping / deliveries and good quality products , which is exactly_what we get from 0000rpm .
0	any_issues with a delivery are sorted within a very short_space of time .
0	my exprience of 0000rpm has always been and i hope will_continue to be reliable , professional , quality and great budgeted company .
0	items we have bought include , printers , inks , cds , cases , flash_drives , cd readers , speaker systems and various hard ware / motherboards / soundcards etc .
0	we are overall very satisfied with thus company and shall_continue to purchase items and spread the word about them .
0	as if it takes this long .
0	and my customer has no evidence that i '_ve even tried to send it .
0	i '_ve been in tears trying to explain that it '_s not my fault .
0	except it is .
0	i chose my hermes .
0	i suck
0	seriously poor service .
0	p0g knew this was important and they charged over_£_00 for next_day service .
0	on tuesday .
0	wasn_'_t collected until thursday and now on monday , it '_s still not their .
0	their customer service staff have no clue .
0	they are worse_than useless - the entire company !
0	supplement wearhouse is one of the best sites for researching as well as purchasing supplements for your workout needs .
0	not only is it easy to navigate , it is consistently the lowest priced supplement webpage around .
0	it '_s accessible and helpful to all types of people , weather a novice or a dedicated gym rat .
0	tried to get tickets for me and 0 friends to see taylor_swift in concert at the o0 ...
0	this was impossible on ticketmaster as they sold out ridiculously quickly .
0	searched for tickets on google and double 0 came up .
0	brilliant service , quite_expensive compared to original prices , but i have the tickets !!
0	thank_you , thank_you , thank_you !!!
0	!
0	this humble shop is a small paradise for hobbyists who collect blind boxed quirky figures / charms / etc .
0	these_guys do the opening and identifying for you , so you know what exactly_what you ' re paying for , instead of dishing wads of cash on blind boxes in an vain attempt to finish your collection ( not speaking from personal experience -- honest !).
0	if you think that sucks the fun out of collecting , then they do sell unopened_boxes to fill the needs of those feeling lucky or want a surprise .
0	dinkybox also has a nice collection of japanese figures ( such as pinky street and revoltech ), as well as books and manga supplies .
0	they don_'_t quite have the biggest selection around , but it '_s a nice shop with a reliable service and great prices .
0	i '_d say it '_s worth a browse .
0	i '_m usually skeptical_about buying clothes online since i '_ve have problems with many sites but yesstyle is one of the few i '_d say is pretty good .
0	the clothes are very attractive and there is a really big selection of styles .
0	the website itself is very easy to browse and its easy to find what you ' re looking for .
0	delivery is super quick , especially if you choose clothes that ' ship within 0 - 0_days '.
0	i ordered on sunday_night and it arrived today -- rather quick for clothes that are imported !
0	all the shirts and jumper fitted_perfectly and i will definitely use this service again .
0	my only gripes with the site is that the delivery is quite_expensive , but understandably so since the clothes are imported from asia .
0	i think its best to order lots of clothes at once so that the delivery fee is worth it .
0	plus , you get can free delivery if you order enough .
0	another problem is that many of the clothes are one - size only , and mostly suit to a medium to petite frame .
0	they don_'_t seem to really cater to anyone who is a uk size 00 and above , much to the disappointment of some my friends .
0	if i could give cultpens more than 0_stars , i would .
0	one of the best online stores i '_ve_used !
0	very quick delivery ( arrived in less_than 0_days ) and an easy to use website .
0	i would not have been disappointed if my package came a bit late in this busy christmas_period , but i '_m surprised that it managed to arrive today !
0	the products i '_ve ordered is good quality and exactly_what i was looking for .
0	would use this website again , once i run_out of supplies .
0	headphones never came after more than a month .
0	emailed them 0 times in that month and recieved automated_replies telling_me to wait longer .
0	finally , after 0_weeks_later , they said they '_ll send me a returns / refund form for my missing order within 00_hours .
0	a week_later and i still_haven_'_t recieved this form !
0	0_weeks in total wasted waiting and no headphones .
0	the rest of the orders i '_ve made have taken longer_than a week or two to arrive .
0	terrible service !
0	use amazon !
0	reliable , quick delivery .
0	very easy to personalized your_own card .
0	the selection of cards are fun and quirky too .
0	highly_recommended !
0	the quality of the materials they use is rather ... questionable .
0	on one of the boots i bought , one of the hooks fell_off after one day .
0	the buttons on the jacket i bought also falls off easily , and i '_ve had to sow them back into place !
0	despite this , i '_m not too disappointed , because indeed , ' quality costs more ' and boohoo . com is one of the many who reinforce this creed .
0	i '_d hope they would have prove me wrong though .
0	i purchased these glasses on the 00th_feb and guess_what ....
0	still_haven_'_t received them so i though i would send them an e_- mail to find out where my glasses were .
0	they said that payment has never been sent and to re - sent the £_000 again !!!
0	shocked !!
0	lucky_enough i paid through paypal and have now opened a dispute .
0	payment was sent and completed the day i placed the order .
0	be very aware !!!
0	scam !!!
0	!
0	easy to use site , great range of products although not everything i wanted was on the site , fab prices , great service i would recommend to others and will buy from them again x
0	i was very skeptical when my friend told me about this website and all the great deals .
0	i looked it up today and found every product i have been doing research on .
0	the deals the have on the website were beyond anything i have ever_seen .
0	all the free products made it that more enjoyable and allows me to try things i would have never thought of trying .
0	i am exstatic when i see a product i have heard about and they have a promotion on it .
0	i can always find something to help boost my results and the description they give help me choose the correct ones without_any_doubts .
0	i will be back with more friends for more purchases !
0	house_network were great all_round .
0	the price was fantastic , saving us about £ 0000 on estate_agent fees .
0	they took lots of excellent photos of every room , all making the house look great .
0	they also gave thorough descriptions and a floor plan .
0	they sent us statistics regularly .
0	they were always easy to contact , and got back to us very quickly with any_queries .
0	we chose house_network after viewing a property they were marketing as we found them cery helpful .
0	overall we would definately recommend them for the price and service .
0	i would definitely recommend chillisauce .
0	they were great at giving advice on what hen_party would be suited to us and answered any_questions that were asked extensively .
0	they provided us with a really enjoyable hen_party
0	i have rated incrystals earlier this month , and the service only keeps getting better !
0	i ordered 0 gifts yesterday , and received them today .
0	you have made 0 people very happy this christmas .
0	thank_you so much
0	sarah xx
0	would definitely recommend using this company to anyone .
0	product was in excellent condition and arrived the next_day as promised .
0	will be using this service again
0	no_complaints .
0	would use again .
0	posted phone on the thursday , received money in my bank by tuesday .
0	very good service and very easy to use .
0	this is the third time ive used mazuma , each time we have found it so quick and easy .
0	we always get argos_vouchers , and always have that within a few_days , but we are kept in the loop via_email to let u know when ure fones been received and when ure argos_card has_been sent out .... im so happy with the service that i havent even considered trying out another company ... and we will_continue to use mazuma twice a year to recycle our old_phones .
0	keep_up the good work !
0	!
0	i was greeted_by the reps at the aiport with no_problems , signed some paper_work and the car was mine .
0	i selected a golf on the choice menu and was adviced i will get a golf or a similar car .
0	instead i got an old megan reno , a very long car which i am not used to driving .
0	i had to drive for 000_miles to get to my destination .
0	when i drove past 00 miles per hour , car was shaking and by the end of the journey i had a headache .
0	my dad told me that car shakes due to unbalanced tyres .
0	i was expecting a newer car that is easy and comfortable to drive .
0	wouldn_'_t use this company again
0	great service , quick delivery and all for a very affordable price !
0	i have never written a review for anything before but i honestly am so pleased with my service and product .
0	i am 0 and a half months pregnant and have just bought a new mattress .
0	it '_s so hard i have been in real discomfort with my back .
0	i decided to order a memory_foam topper and after_searching the net found zleeps to be the cheapest .
0	i ordered a silver topper it came within 0 working_days and i got two free memory_foam pillows !
0	very pleased very comfy .
0	don_'_t be put off by bad_reviews these people were either very unlucky or the reviews are fake .
0	i am going to be recommending this site to friends and family
0	boohoo from the start of my order were fantastic , great communication_throughout and all their products were a great price .
0	the only_suggestion to customers would be is if you are in a rush for your outfit to pay extra for delivery as standard delivery does take a while .
0	i had seen a number of isofix car seats on the market and struggled to make a decison .
0	i then came_across the britax isofix seat on precious_little one and read the customer reviews and product specification .
0	it was high in the safety ratings and also has a recline feature .
0	the car_seat when it came was high_quality and was dispatched very quickly .
0	as always great quality & service provided by precious_little one .
0	" enormously disappointing .
0	i placed a considerable order with digitalrev , paying through paypal .
0	the next_day i received an_email " confirming ' that my order had " successfully " been cancelled .
0	no explanation was given so i checked the website and saw again that it had simply been cancelled .
0	i thought i must have cancelled it in error by clicking the wrong link so placed the order again , again paying through paypal .
0	the order was confirmed but then half an_hour later i received a second email_telling_me that my order had been cancelled .
0	again there was no explanation .
0	this time i found a contact number and called customer_services who told me it had been cancelled because they had been unable to link me to my address .
0	they needed me to send them various forms of id etc and then if i passed their checks i would be able to place another order .
0	now , i don_'_t mind them conducting security_checks at all ; i think that '_s a good thing and in everybody '_s interest but i do mind very much their cavalier attitude_towards my custom as well as my time and energy .
0	if they need more information , is it too much to expect that they would contact me and ask for it instead of just cancelling my order with no explanation ?
0	i order a huge number of products online both from the uk and overseas and have never encountered this before .
0	i was paying through paypal and both billing and shipping addresses are paypal verified and have been used on numerous_occasions .
0	as i say , it is not the security_checks that bother me , it is their extraordinarily dismissive attitude_towards someone_who is simply trying to buy their products ."
0	the item was just as expected , and arrived in great condition and super_fast .
0	i would recomend to anyone .
0	this site is very user_friendly , easy to navigate and find what you are looking for , as well as lots of information on each_hostel .
0	it is also cheaper_than hostelworld .
0	fast dispatch , item exactly as_described , great price !!!
0	!
0	i needed a wetsuit and had found the site link on an info board down at the lakes where my friends jetski .
0	i found the website very easy to use and found a suitable wetsuit at an extremely reasonable_price within about 0 minutes of looking .
0	it was a thursday and needed it for the weekend so ordered next_day delivery but realised it had to be before 0pm and i placed the ordered at 0 . 00pm but it still came the next_day !!
0	i was so stoked and it fit me perfectly .
0	now anything i need for the water i '_ll be coming here first !
0	need some booties next :)
0	it can be a struggle finding the perfectly fitting frame and sending something away to be framed can take an age .
0	then l found this site .
0	with a range of different frames and whatever size you want , with a range of mounts , it was really simple .
0	all l had to do was measure the item l wanted framed , pick the size and dimensions of mount and they sort the size of frame for it .
0	couple days for it to be delivered .
0	will be using them again .
0	the item l ordered from here arrived quickly and was brilliant quality .
0	i was looking for something different for christmas_present and loved the range and prices available on this site .
0	the items l ordered arrived quickly and were great quality .
0	also delivery was well_packed to ensure little chance of damages - other_companies should take_note !
0	really impressed with them and will definitely be using them again .
0	i had been needing a new watch_strap for a while but l really wanted to get the right one to go with the model of my watch .
0	i had been struggling to find it until l came_across babla '_s .
0	they didn_'_t have the strap on their site but had an option to put in my make and model of watch and they would source the strap for me .
0	it took them no time at all to find the correct strap and have it sent out to me .
0	i would definitely use the site again and recommend it to others .
0	they are ok
0	transfer from halifax to bv takes minutes
0	i suspect they have automated_system for deposits , which is nice , not like in goldmoney . com when you wait for days
0	did some withdrawal months_ago , no problem , fast and good
0	fees per_month range from 0 usd to 0 usd for each metal
0	overall they are ok
0	secure because they send sms ( 00 pence price ) to phone of activities
0	and only deal with one main bank_account address
0	so all ins and outs are fixed to main acc
0	thinking , since uk gov taxes silver 00_% vat , is it not a bad idea to have silver in uk vaults ?
0	have some , and worry_about thieving uk gov
0	i am a massive_fan of asos and have been for years_now .
0	it '_s such a pleasure using their site ; really easy to navigate and ( being a picky girl ) i love the search and filter functions .
0	my favourite part is most_likely the saved items page , this has_been so handy since it was introduced i really hope it stays as i now find every site that doesn_'_t have this to be quite a pain .
0	i don_'_t often return things as sizing is generally spot_on with their own branded clothing and the brands they supply , but when i have had to return it has_been free and the refund is actioned really quickly .
0	as far as issues with orders or products , this is where they shine .
0	i had an order turn_up with a product missing ( the top of the package had been sliced , i assume at the courier depot ) and i was refunded straight_away as a replacement could not be sent .
0	on another occasion a product turned_up and had a defect so i emailed customer_services , then shortly_after received a response offering compensation ( part refund ) so i was really chuffed to have a resolution , and a positive one !
0	i wholeheartedly_recommend asos , really great company .
0	would recommend mazuma to everyone one who_asks about selling a phone .
0	really fast reliable from beginning to to end .
0	00 out of 00
0	when looking around for a case for my samsung note 0 , there were many available on ebay but none actually stated they were for a note so didn_'_t want to buy just in case .
0	i came_across this website and the description matched exactly_what i was looking for .
0	purple is my favourite colour and delivery was when it was expected .
0	i '_m very happy with the service that i received and the product i purchased !
0	they were great !
0	they always came_across very professionally , friendly and helpful .
0	i didn_'_t feel under_pressure .
0	i '_ve_used gear0music loads of times and pretty_much rebuilt my drum_kit with the things i '_ve bought off them .
0	my cymbals were always immaculate when they arrived and even_though all the pieces of bubble_wrap and cardboard were a pain to get_rid of , it was well_worth it .
0	staff were very friendly when i rang them up with a query and they emailed me everything i needed to know within minutes !
0	i '_m actually due a delivery today so as long as it turns_up , 0 / 0 every time :)
0	after applying online , i received my postage bag the next_day , sent my phone off and then received my cash 0_days_later !
0	highly_recommend this website .
0	this is the second time i '_ve_used mazuma_mobile and will_definately do so again !
0	i had a great experience buying my prom_dress .
0	it was very easy to look for and purchase the dress .
0	i loved it ! i love prdress !!
0	!
0	they are amazing , very fast and friendly .. easy to add funds to your account and make calls to any country .
0	i would advise anyone to use dialtosave .
0	this is my second purchase with procook and again another great puchase .
0	i have only ever bought knives from here but my first set have been excellent and all my visitors to my kitchen comment on them .
0	this set is a gift for my mum and i am sure she will not be disappointed !
0	!
0	printerland '_s service was excellent !
0	they offered next_day delivery and they arrived as promised .
0	the toners we ordered are great value for money .
0	we will be placing orders again and i would certainly recommend to others .
0	i am extremely happy with the service provided by this company .
0	my item was dispatched very quickly and i was kept_updated about its location every_step of the way .
0	thank_you very much for such a professional service .
0	i have already_recommended this company to others and will_continue to do so !
0	i bought a pair of shape ups for £_00 less_than rrp and they arrived the next_day .
0	this was the first time i shopped at fitness footwear .
0	i '_m very happy and will buy from them again .
0	i waited 0_weeks only to receive the wrong book .
0	i had to call them up and arrange for another to be sent out , which took another 0_weeks .
0	i had to return the book they sent in error at my own cost , which i wasn_'_t happy about , because it what they sent me was a hardback and it weighed a lot .
0	but , this is the only time i '_ve had problems with them .
0	when ordering dvds they ' re brilliant .
0	enromous range , great prices and fast delivery for when you need a pair of pretty boots urgently .
0	i couldn_'_t ask for more from an online shop .
0	easy to find what i wanted , place and order and my boots arrived the next_day !
0	i '_ve been using different e_liquids for a while but struggled to find ones that actually have a proper taste and vape .
0	these were awesome and will definitely be buying more in the future .
0	ordered a washing_machine 0_weeks_ago !
0	it still has not arrived !
0	i have been constantly_fobbed_off by the sales_staff !
0	to top the whole ordeal off they tryed to deliver the washing_machine on thursday but forgot to put it on the delivery van !
0	actually turned_up at the house without the washing_machine !
0	i am now 00 weeks_pregnant and have been without a washing_machine for 0_weeks because of this company !
0	i wish i had gone to john_lewis who all actually stock the same washing but £_00 cheaper !
0	will i ever get this washer ?
0	who_knows ?
0	i think they should offer more swagbucks for everything you do .
0	i mean , i never watch those videos , and i bet no one else does either , but it takes nearly 00_minutes to earn 0 swagbucks by ' watching ' them , and 000 = £ 0 .
0	and i '_m not a geek and i wouldn_'_t click through ads hundreds of times just to earn some pocket money .
0	think about it .
0	conclusion : they really should be more generous on the amount of swagbucks awarded , or lower the price of the gift cards .
0	i purchased a nikon_d0000 ( with a battery and charger ) in so called ' mint -' condition , from mpb_photographic for £_000 . 00 , but was a bit_nervous as this was the first 0nd_hand item i had bought .
0	i requested it for monday , and it arrived on monday at about 00 : 00 .
0	i couldn_'_t_believe someone had used it , in fact , i inspected the dslr for any sign of light use and could not find any , anywhere !
0	the camera was in better condition than if i bought it off amazon for £_000_+ extra in new condition !
0	the customer service was fantastic ; the phone staff where friendly and helpful .
0	best camera shopping website for the uk !
0	i will definitely be shopping here again !
0	great service from andy , and very easy to arrange over the net .
0	no waiting around in a garage - you can do it in the comfort of your_own_home .
0	i will definitely recommend !
0	great website .
0	i can now express my feelings and tell others about my experience about different shope i have bought with !
0	thanks trustpilot !
0	love you guys !
0	all i can say
0	really happy with all the items i bought , price paid , communication and packaging .
0	would use again
0	i placed an order on 00st november which i thought would be plenty of time for christmas .
0	nothing turned_up after 0_weeks so i emailed them .
0	they replied to my first email and said the order had been dispatched and was probably delayed .
0	gave them the benefit of the doubt and left it another week .
0	still nothing arrived so i emailed them again ( no contact number available and the live_chat doesn_'_t work ).
0	after a few more days they hadn_'_t replied so i raised a dispute through paypal .
0	they put a reply on the paypal_dispute pretty quickly but it was quite rude , no apology just the standard ' this has_been dispatched , we will investigate , we still give you the chance to cancel this dispute etc etc '.
0	they contacted me again today through paypal saying ' please confirm you have received the goods ' - sorry , all i can confirm is that i '_ve paid £_00 for absolutely nothing !
0	don_'_t order from these people !
0	!
0	i had a bespoke wedding_ring made to fit my engagement_ring as it '_s an odd_shape .
0	it took just two_days to receive the design for my ring , then 0 week for it to arrive in the shop for me to collect ( home delivery is an option ).
0	when i went to collect my rings i was surprised to see that my engagement_ring had been cleaned and was looking as good as new again .
0	the presentation of my wedding_ring was amazing too , a smart box inside a cute presentation_box inside a lovely bag whereas i was just expecting a ring box .
0	the service i received in store at bluewater was also fantastic .
0	colouring pages and pencils were supplied so i could really focus on getting my ideas . across on how i want my ring to be .
0	the staff were friendly at all times .
0	i '_ll be recommending the store to everyone i know !
0	thank_you very much .
0	the ordering process was very unclear since the website states they have stock and the managers in the company are unaware of stock_levels saying that they did not have it in stock at the time of purchase , but they had stock now so i would need to reorder again , he was unaware of how to cancel and order or even send anything out .
0	i wasted time , money and energy with this site for a pair of boots that cost over_£_000 .
0	i would rather go to another company or better still buy something_else .
0	the service is completely unhelpful , rude and incompetent .
0	would not shop_here again nor recommend to anyone .
0	if you are looking for a cheap nightstay but you are not too self confident in terms of your orientation and organisation skills , hostelbooker will help you , it s very comfortable to chose time and place on their page and they will you show wide offer , all presented in convenient form , and setting the matter after your choice takes honestly 0 min . if it seems that something happen and you could call off your travel , you can choose the option of payment protection when you are booking , so that your 00_% paid at booking will turn to another booking . thats a good possibilty , because the planned travel is never 000_% sure , but undoubtly i will_continue my booking with hostelbooker so my money stay there like in bank . and another matter , once my credit_card wasn t valid , they asked the hostel s manager to let_me pay all at arriving , that was really nice of them and solved my problem in this case
0	and they also remind you about the travel , giving details and that helps a lot
0	i ve_used that service many_times and they never let_me down
0	look fantastic had everything i wanted to buy at a great price and the website was extremely user_friendly .
0	the reviews also helped to inform my decision on my purchases - just a shame p_&_p wasnt included in the price .
0	very pleased with the product , was as_described .
0	fast delivery .
0	thankyou
0	everything i order from here always_arrives in great shape .
0	i have ordered certain products from other_websites that arrive with water_damage or other issues .
0	never had a problem with supplement_warehouse !
0	i love hostelbookers because when you compare the same hotel or hostel on 0 other different sites , hostelbookers always gets you the best fares !
0	it '_s easy , clear and pretty quick .
0	have been using it for years !
0	i sent my phone to mazuma on saturday_morning and the money as quoted was in my account for monday_afternoon .
0	excellent , honest and reliable service , will recommend to friends and would use again !!
0	!
0	the costume is fantastic quality got here faster then expected and i would defiantly use the sight again and recommend it to a friend .
0	great job .
0	we were in need of 0 new tyres and found this site after they emailed us with a price compare option .
0	the tyres were very easy to view and order online , and when i phoned to speak to a member of the sales_team , the phone was answered quickly and the guy i spoke to was very friendly , helpful , and knowledgeable .
0	i '_m always a bit_wary buying expensive items online from a company i know nothing about , but i will most definitely use them again when the tyres on our other car need replacing .
0	so much_cheaper_than we were quoted by local_garages .
0	i can '_t praise them enough !!
0	!
0	glasses arrived this morning , delighted with them .
0	pleased with the overall service and quality of the products .
0	particularly valued the free home_trial service which i used twice because none of the first set i selected suited me .
0	would definitely recommend and will use again in the future .
0	i have used iflorist before , they have always been punctual and the flowers are always high_quality and last a long time .
0	still unknown_reason_why i didn_'_t get my collection today , so contacted customer service on live_chat , and i was speaking to matthew , who quickly sort it out and re - booked my collection for next_day .
0	he was very polite and apologised for no show of the courier .
0	unfortunately my parcel will be delayed and have to wait another day at home with my fingers_crossed that they will show to collect it .
0	super promotions and fantastic products to buy :) thank_you
0	envirofone were incredibly efficient with regard to sending me my packaging along with sending me the money for my old phone .
0	their reminder_emails were very helpful and their pricing was fair
0	not only did they lose my suitcase , but even with a luggage receipt they could not tell me where my suitcase was or when i was likely to get it back .
0	i explained i was only in st_tropez for 0_days and that i had no clothing / toiletries with me .
0	my suitcase arrived the next_day and i received a call saying i would have to pick it up from nice airport - st_tropez is 0 hrs from there .
0	nearly all other_airlines will deliver your case to you if they lose it but not jet 0 .
0	so it was up to me to make a return trip and lose a full day of my holiday .
0	in addition i was not compensated for the cost of this trip .
0	when i arrived at the airport i found my suitcase was damaged and is no_longer usable - it was brand_new .
0	i wrote a letter of complaint when i got home asking to be reimbursed for the expense and the response was ' no chance '!
0	i would never fly with them again and i would strongly_recommend avoiding this airline at all costs .
0	as it is so easy to use i always do my booking and shopping online if i can now .
0	it takes an extra 00 seconds to go through the website and in 0_months i '_ve already claimed almost £_00 .
0	i even di my car insurance through them .
0	i shopped arund and found the best deal , then went through top_cash_back and saved even more !
0	i had a lady called claire help within the booking team and she could not have been more helpful .
0	i requirements changed daily until booking but nothing was to much_trouble .
0	it was so nice and refreshing to have so much help .
0	would highly_recommend this company and use it again in the future .
0	next_day delivery for a good cost ( only £ 0 . 00 not £ 0 or £ 0 ) and the jacket i bought cheaper_than other_websites .
0	learn '_t so much .
0	i was unsure at first , whether to put my tv on the wall , as i had always had it up the corner on a stand .
0	my lounge isn_'_t the biggest in the world , and every time i moved my furniture around i always felt like the biggest corner in my room was sucked up by my tv .
0	i rang home av , and spoke to ian , i told him my worries and concerns , he listened and gave_me helpful advice .
0	i didn_'_t feel pushed or like he was trying to sell me anything .
0	i arranged a time for him to come out and show me where he thought would be best for my tv to be mounted , and asked for a quote .
0	working full time , i didn_'_t think he would want to come out on an evening , but he was flexible and fit around me .
0	happy with the quote , i asked him when he could do it .
0	just 0_days_later , ian & jamie returned to hang my tv on the wall .
0	one word describes how it looks - amazing !
0	!
0	i am so happy , and they even hoovered up after themselves .
0	thanks home av , i will definitely be recommending you !!
0	all the best for your future .
0	i really appreciate to use the dial to save service as it provide me lots of facilities to get in touch with my relatives .
0	best aerline to go in a holyday trip
0	is the easiest_way to find your perfect holiday
0	is the easiest and fastest way to shop
0	tesco is the best food shop , the best prices end the food is very fresh .
0	a greate companay , greate mobile deals !
0	thank to mazuma_mobile , it was a greate experience , mazuma help me u sell my old_phones at a gtreate value . thanks
0	i have been using printing . com for about 0 years_now and i cannot thank enough for their fast and high_quality service .
0	i recommend you guys to people all the time !
0	thanks .
0	in short , terrible network_coverage , terrible pushy rude and sometimes unintelligable customer service from call_centre and nearly_impossible to get unlock_code and pac codes from .
0	thanks 0 - i have been without a mobile for a week !!!

0	i '_ve booked a hen_night through a company before and wasn_'_t verly pleased with the outcome of the night so was a little_apprehensive at 0st about booking through a company again but due to the limited time i had to book s ' thing as it was pretty last_minute i decided to investigate a little .
0	originally when i put my options into the boxes at the beginning i went all out to see what the prices would end up at , it was a little expensive but after_speaking with mike agar (??)
0	a consultant with hen_heaven who was extremely_helpful , we managed to get it to a price i thought people could_afford and would still hopefully be a great night out .
0	unfortunately our hen who is australian was stuck in oz due to visa problems and some of the guests decided not to come , but 0 of us went along and made the best of it .
0	so manchester here we came ..... in the afternoon we did a cocktail_making session which was so much fun and we managed to drink enough for everyone that should '_ve been there .
0	we didn_'_t know we were getting nibbles at the end of it which was an added_bonus to soak up some of the alcohol .
0	the meal and club_entry in the evening was at tiger_tiger which was fab .
0	tiger_tiger has 0 floors to it so altho we had to be in there before 00pm to get our free entry it didn_'_t really matter cos it was already quite busy and we spent most of the evening in the 00 '_s / 00 '_s section .
0	the hotel was right in the centre of everywhere we needed to be so we saved money on taxi fares and it was very comfortable .
0	the only_downside to the evening was that in tiger_tiger they questioned us about the 0 complimentary bottles of champagne we were to receive and also about the payment at the end , they accused us of trying to walk out without paying so i had to keep showing them the email from hen_heaven proving that we were to get the bottles and that everything was paid for which was a little embarrassing but overall we had a great night .
0	like i said before i was a little_apprehensive_about booking through a company again but hen_heaven made things so easy that when the hen eventually gets over here i may well be booking through them again .....
0	i cannot_fault anything from this company .
0	we first bought a sideboard and a telephone table .
0	then afterwards we went back for a table , mirror and bookcase !!
0	the quality of the furniture is next to none and the price is even better compared to other oak_furniture i '_ve seen .
0	everything from service in store to the delivery men where fantastic !!!!
0	thank_you !!
0	it makes a change to see excellent customer service like this !!
0	!
0	last_week i got last_minute tickets through viagogo to the chelsea flower show which was incredible !
0	despite the short_notice i got great value tickets , delivered well in time for the show .
0	i have used them many_times before and never once had a problem with tickets or using the site which i personally find clear and easy to use .
0	i would strongly_recommend viagogo , especially for when looking for last_minute tickets .
0	we purchased little life toddler reins in fairy wings style .
0	my daughter absolutly loves the design as she feels she has her own bag instead of wearing reins .
0	the zip compartment is just right for a small teddy and a cup of juice .
0	the strap is strong and not too long .
0	the delivery was quick and all in all a wonderful service .
0	we are very happy and will shop with coz mole again .
0	[_name_] made sending my parcel so easy .
0	even when i got it wrong , [_name_] fixed my mistake quickly and efficiently .
0	a credit to your company !
0	!
0	simple to use and search , once booked i get a full email with the details i need .... simple
0	i spoke to sam , she was so helpful and friendly .
0	i couldn_'_t have asked for better service .
0	she kept in touch and checked everything was okay from_start to finish .
0	thanks a lot .
0	after all the ads on tv and saying it was best supermarket blahblah thought_id try out aldi paisley ( fulbar road ) scotland for the family shop .
0	going round the products are good , good range of choices for a cheaper supermaket , even a few brand_names .
0	however , get to the checkout and lets say service with a smile isnt their thing .
0	woman sat like a robot , didnt offer to help even_though struggling with a toddler .
0	was sighing as things started to pile up at one side .
0	i hadnt even finished paying and she was scanning the next persons products .
0	she was on to the next after that before i had my bags up .
0	and just so you know i wasnt going like a wee old lady , i was actually getting things together pretty fast .
0	i will not be shopping here again , ever .
0	if people worked like that in any other supermarket they '_d be sacked .
0	horrible dire faced woman .
0	now off to check sellby dates on stuff after_reading_reviews .
0	very disappointed .
0	i ordered some ghd_straighteners on sunday , as my old ones decided to stop working suddenly .
0	i ordered new ones with beautycow as they had the ones i wanted for the cheapest price .
0	i received them today ( wednesday ).... quick and painless !
0	thank_you beautycow for your excellent price and service .... i finally have straight hair again !
0	i just completed a photoshop cs0 and web design course with e_- careers , it taught me a lot and i will keep in mind e_- careers if i want to do a course again .
0	kirsten slater
0	i purchased a hair_dryer .
0	i ´ ve choosen the uk standard delivery and the item arrived next_day .
0	excellent timming !
0	the package was good and the product was as drescribed on the web_site .
0	i probably will purchase with this company again .
0	i found the site very easy to use , especially the pay_pal option which made checkout very fast .
0	i ordered a poster for my daughter and i was so pleased with the result .
0	communication was excellent and they also went the extra_mile by offering help and advice .
0	before the poster arrived a was a little_concerned_about what the quality would be as the poster was so cheap !
0	however when it arrived in its secure tube it was fantastic !
0	will definitely use again .
0	i bought a wowcher for a full head of human_hair_extensions in march .
0	i contacted the salon and arranged an_appointment for a consultation , which i attended .
0	i arranged an_appointment for 0_weeks_later to have a full head of micro loop extensions fitted .
0	on the day of the appointment i was 00_minutes late due to an accident on the motorway .
0	thank god !!!
0	i was told i couldn_'_t have my extensions fitted as i was so late and would have to rearrange .
0	i was asked what sort of extensions i was having and when i said micro loops i was told they didn_'_t do these anymore and i '_d have to either have them glued or sewn in .
0	i don_'_t want either of these methods due to the damage they do to your hair which is why i bought a deal for the micro loops .
0	i contacted wowcher for a refund 0_weeks_ago and the only response i have received is a copy of the email they sent to the salon 0_days_later .
0	i contacted them again last_week to ask for some indication of when they issue might be resolved and i '_ve heard_nothing .
0	i '_ve emailed them this morning with ' trust ' as the subject , but as yet i have no reply .
0	i am really disappointed with the level of customer service .
0	the maternity bras i have purchased are fantastic .
0	i have never had an issue with tesco .
0	they are taking over but a wrose complany could be dominating the uk !
0	i always buy my clothes online with the good value clothes that i love .
0	i always love that i can get free delivery and pick the items up from store !
0	love tesco :)
0	i have always used paypal and i have accepted certain charges but now whenever i sell items on ebay i have to pay a large percentage to paypal :( most items i sell don_'_t sell for much anyway !
0	i '_d accept it , even if it was a much_lower percent of the income .
0	maybe more simelar to ebay charges which averages around 00p for me for an item that i sell for £ 0 .
0	i love fb and i use it constantly .
0	it does everything i need it to and it doesnt need to keep changing to be like other_websites !
0	it was betetr when it was a little_bit more simple .
0	the simplicity was what separated it and made it stand_out from the other social_network websites !
0	i have bought 0 products now from selectspecs . com and i have been very pleased with each product .
0	perscription glasses for £ 0 each !
0	and i think that included delievery .
0	probikeshop is a good market !
0	recomended !
0	brilliant order arrived in less_than 00_hours
0	not just competitively_priced they were straight to notice i '_d mis_- ordered a prescription item and got in touch .
0	they resolved it instantly and i even received my order the next_day ( i placed the order mid - afternoon ).
0	wow_wow_wow !
0	i will be back !
0	i love twitter , and unlike_other social_media it is so simple to get your head around and whilst it evolves it doesn_'_t change massively so it '_s easy to keep on top of !
0	when you arrive on time or within about ten_minutes ryanair play this awful fanfare ... talk about blowing your_own trumpet .
0	i guess you get what you pay for !
0	that '_s why i '_ve since flown with easyjet or monarch !
0	so simple to upload videos !
0	facebook and i are best friends !
0	i use it to promote my business as well as being_able to maintain a private profile to keep_up with friends !
0	always prompt to respond and go above and beyond other_companies .
0	despite allowing any resolution images to be loaded that look brilliant on the screen there is no quality control at goodprint so my business_cards came to me blurry on one side and fab on the other !
0	i even had a comment from goodprint twitter saying my design was fab surely at that point someone could have said ' hey the resolution isn_'_t quite right are you sure you want to continue ?'
0	when i contacted customer service i was fed a line and not offered any support or encouragement to use the service again !
0	- thank_you for your response goodprint , i was not advised on this offer at the time of my phonecall , had i been i would have felt a lot less let_down by your company .
0	i have since had my cards printed elsewhere but i do appreciate the response .
0	tried to order from vet_medic and set_up an account .
0	unfortunately i chose to pay by paypal which had an old email address associated with it , they took this to be my address which i think it a very flawed way to do_business .
0	thus i did not receive emails when they queried my order , amongst the problems ( generated by them ) was the fact that the image of my vet prescription did not upload .
0	i definitely uploaded this when i ordered and inotice other people have had the same problem .
0	despite this , they took the money from my account and made no further effort to contact me , even_though they could have worked out the email address they used did not match the email and account details i provided .
0	i complained and when we go to the bottom of the misunderstanding i asked them for an_apology - told on the phone they had nothing to apologise for .
0	i also found they were rude and defensive , everything was my fault rather_than theirs !
0	i asked for a refund which they promptly processed .
0	i will never order from vet -_medic again , best avoided if you appreciate good customer service and politeness when things go_wrong !
0	i am an_avid trollbead collector and i buy all my charms from identity .
0	every time i receive fantastic customer service and they have a vast_range of charms to choose from .
0	i would definitely reccommend a visit !
0	!
0	searched for hostels in aberdeenshire and this was really simple to find and book .
0	have used hostelbookers in the past and stayed in some good quality hostels .
0	helpful not to have to pay the full_amount up front .
0	catherine_corless is a very kind and efficient member of your staff , i highly_recomend this service to anyone .
0	after i finished my job in aus , i started to travel to east asia by myself .
0	so i had to stay in hostel .
0	i need booking site which give me fully information about hostel .
0	hostelbookers is the one gave_me all of information about hostel .
0	even when i lost my way to find hostel , i don_'_t need to be panic .
0	i just check direction in confirmation e_- mail .
0	thank_you .
0	we ordered save the date magnets from bride and groom_direct with the promise they would be shipped within 0 to 0_days of the order .
0	after two_weeks with no news i rang to chase them up and was told the carrier cards were out of stock .
0	i was annoyed that we hadn_'_t had a simple email or phone_call to explain the delay .
0	when they did eventually arrive a month later than promised , they were lovely cards .
0	we may use them again as the products were so good but we will be ordering a long time in_advance !
0	la la love these_guys , would diffidently order again and again .
0	they were the first to pop up on google lol so i hopped on it and took my chances .
0	0st off my price match wasn_'_t met b /_c it was from amazon ..
0	but they still took 0 $ off there price to lower the price the shipping was a bit much but not any different from amazon .
0	that being said i ordered my product wednesday and got it friday early 0am !
0	and the product came in mint_condition < 0 super excited and happy with my expierience .
0	there are a lot of negative_reviews but i '_m telling you try them for yourself ..
0	extremely courteous and helpful !
0	;)
0	disgusting unhelpful service .
0	no flowers received despite the fact they claim it was delivered .
0	thanks for making my moms mothers_day .
0	not .
0	really disappointed
0	i heard of safercigs from aaec forum and it '_s great !
0	good prices and delivered quickly will order from them again .
0	i was served by sarah_hayes , which made everything in very efficient way
0	i booked my hen_weekend through chillisauce and found the service to be excellent .
0	the staff are really friendly , answer_questions quickly and really do get you a fantastic deal .
0	there was 00 of us and we stayed in two gorgeous apartments in central edinburgh , these had everything we needed and were very secure and were large enough to accommodate hen_night games etc .
0	on the saturday we went cocktail_making , all the girls said this was a highlight and excellent value for money and the bartender was great fun , included were nibbles - these we ' re huge platters and were well received after quite a bit of alcohol !
0	as part of our deal we were given free entry to a few clubs , a 0 - course_meal and we also had a spa day included with treatments - a perfect end to the weekend .
0	i couldn_'_t have organised this myself for the price we paid , i '_m so glad i booked through chillisauce and would have no_worries recommending them - in fact my other half has his stag_party in a couple of weeks and this was booked through chillisauce .
0	honestly can '_t thank_you enough for making my hen_weekend one to remember and everything i wanted it to be !
0	in peopleperhour i found a pool of talented people that were just there when i needed them .
0	i tried to move my transportation business on the web by creating a simple , yet practical reservation system that increased my traffic .
0	starting from the technical aspect of setting_up the web_site and continuing with the logo and web design , firm branding and seo enhancements that would attract more clients to my site , pph freelancers were there for me ; not only to successfully complete the task i was assigning them , but also to give me insights on how to set_up my service more efficiently .
0	what '_s more important is that when i didn_'_t know how to find what i wanted or had questions , their awesome customer support was there to assist me and help me move on .
0	i really owe them a lot !
0	i witnessed a 00_% increase of traffic in my business via the online reservation system in at about 0_months .
0	thanks for that pph !
0	ordered a highly demanded tent recently and had the normal free delivery on it .
0	tent price was very reasonable compared to elsewere and was a little_bit_dubious but thought what the hey .
0	i wasn_'_t expecting it to arrive until the 0th of may and infact arrived on the 0th .
0	very impressed .
0	could not ask for better_than that !
0	the tent as expected is of high_quality and worth_every_penny !
0	can '_t wait for the next camping_trip !
0	!
0	thank_you taunton_leisure .
0	one very happy customer .
0	quick delivery , even gave_me a 0 hour time_slot for delivery .
0	brilliant :)
0	i have found out about raw_gaia by_chance browsing the internet .
0	before ordering i have asked for some recommendation , lucy responded me and i have made my first order .
0	it was very easy to order and paid through paypal , easy and secure , and my order came very quickly .
0	it was was packed impeccably , and the rose_buds was a nice_touch .
0	sun dried green clay face pack is great , my favorite at the moment , i love the living facial cleaner too , it actually hydrates my skin .

0	i ordered 0 mother '_s day bouquets .
0	i spotted that the courier company '_s confirmation_email had the wrong_address the day before mother '_s day .
0	i emailed to alert them to the problem .
0	didn_'_t hear_anything back so i rang up .
0	spent 00_minutes on the phone to their indian_call_centre .
0	the person i was speaking to just didn_'_t understand that there were two roads in london with the same name and that they were delivering to the wrong one ( despite me putting the correct postcode in my original order ).
0	i was promised ( i ) a callback that day and ( ii ) that the flowers would be delivered .
0	surprise_surprise .
0	no call back .
0	no flowers delivered .
0	just come off the phone with customer_services ( another 00 minute phone_call ) whereby i was told the i would definitely get a call back today - i '_ve heard that one before !
0	she apparently couldn_'_t put me through to head_office ...
0	so gave_me a number to call .
0	am sat here on hold , again , so i have lots of time to write this review .
0	p . s .
0	the flowers that were delivered were a miserable bunch of brown flowers - was not worth the money !
0	i signed_up after trialling the product for a week and was amazed_at how simple everything was .
0	they certainly picked a good name for the product !
0	i '_ve found that the software can do an awful_lot , but the way in which it '_s presented makes all the difference .
0	i was all setup and emailing candidates within minutes .
0	i ’ ve found their technical_support to be very good and they are always updating the product with customer suggestions .
0	such a breath of fresh_air from my previous software which shall_remain anonymous :-)
0	i '_ve been using hostelbookers for quite a while , since i traveled in europe three years_ago .
0	i '_ve always found trustworthy , inexpensive places to stay through them ( and their prices really are the cheapest among the other hostel sites ...
0	i '_ve checked !).
0	never had a problem confirming my reservation through them or checking in with my reservation at hostel locations across the world !
0	highly_recommended for students and young people looking to travel on a budget !
0	always have what you want , or they do their best to get from another store .
0	very competitive_pricing and easy to choose online or in store .
0	like their new system instore .
0	always helpful , changing anything you return or refunds .
0	never had a bad_word_against them .
0	we have always been with o0 found them to be very reliable company , good choice of phones and very reasonable with their deals and rates .
0	we found superfoods website to be very informative and that is why we ordered from them .
0	we have to wait three_months before we can leave a feedback relating to the effects of what we ordered .
0	so far we are pleased with their quick delivery and efforts so far .
0	sarah and ben
0	this is the best booking site i '_ve_used !
0	accommodation is booked and confirmed within_seconds and the layout of the site makes it super easy to narrow_down searches and find what youre looking for .
0	would use again and recommend to everyone :)
0	well i was supposed to have a reunion of sorts with my rebel girl gang from college and was not sure what to buy as it was summer .
0	my problem was that i was supposed to meet on the weekend and was really caught up at work .
0	so during a chit chat with a colleague at my work she suggested to buy a dress online .
0	she in the same breath suggested to check out miss rebel .
0	being summer i wanted something flowery and vibrant .
0	in the evening when i logged_into missrebel . co . uk it was in for a surprise for the share range and cost at which they sold .
0	unbelievable !
0	gosh , it was a crisis of plenty !
0	trust me it was tough to decide what not to buy !
0	the summer collection was so beautiful .
0	and it took me 00_minutes to decide on a long summer dress with flower patterns .
0	not easy for a girl huh !
0	but most who i had heard from about internet_shopping came with a warning about the problems in delivery .
0	but due to work constraint i gave it a shot !
0	this was wednesday_evening and i was set to meet my four friends on saturday .
0	guess_what miss rebel delivered the dress at my home soon after i came back from work on friday .
0	and that really made my day !
0	so when i went for the reunion , i received compliments from everyone .
0	i would strongly_recommend missrebel !!!
0	keep rebeling gals !
0	!
0	well , good items , shopped few_times .... good shopping_experience .... worth a try .
0	ordered something , but was delivered ( and addressed ) to wrong_address .
0	so never received it .
0	company should accept_responsibility for their incompentence .
0	and a bit of customer service would have been nice .
0	they expect me to sort this out .
0	visa dispute will has_been opened !
0	i just don_'_t like dominos ...
0	they got all this badly trained youngsters to cook pizza ... wel sometimes you better of not to eat that !
0	don_'_t know why ... but i used it since i was 00 ...
0	good but a bit more expinsive than go direct sometims ...
0	so liked my new jewellery box , highly_recommend !
0	i so like this search_engine
0	rude personal !

0	used it for 0 years .
0	cheers
0	i have a linux dedicated server running fedora with fasthosts web hosting .
0	i have been with them for 0_months .
0	the last month has_been dreadful .
0	updates controlled through fasthosts wiping out php class files , and down times that break their service level agreements .
0	the update lost me 0 and 0 / 0_days , as they have no engineer support at the weekend - losses into thousands .
0	no apology , no communication and no one who_knows what they are doing .
0	recently lost all connection to my dedicated server , and the matrix control_panel is plagued with problems - still without imap or pop0 for the third time in a row .
0	i will be switching in the new year when i have the energy for it .
0	i may have to pay extra , but going for the budget option has meant fire fighting with them all the time , they will always tell you a problem is nothing to do with them , and then low and behold it is !
0	i have been boots customer for over 0 years .
0	experience is generally fine but boots . com is terrible .
0	recently placed an order for around £_000 and got it cancelled with no reason .
0	bank confirms the money has_been claimed , delivery address is the same as billing_address .
0	called the customer service but is absolutely no helpful .
0	feel very disappointed and angry .
0	they just think they are big enough to treat badley their existing_customers .
0	wonderful service - delivery has never been easier to me .
0	i simply went to my local_supermarket ( sainsbury ) whenever i wish within 00_hours to collect the parcel from lockers .
0	no curious question asked just simply brilliant .
0	indeed , i have problems with two of my parcels ( a samsung_tablet and an ipod_touch ) gone_missing within mybybox network though those were compensated to its full value very promptly by mybybox
0	brilliant as always , have been using parcel0go many_times within 0 years_now .
0	today again received brilliant support from sammie_taylor .
0	you are an angel
0	be careful when you buy from here since you may get what you did not want you will be stuck with it
0	thank_you parcel 0 go .
0	they '_ve picked_up two laptops which i sent at a reasonable_price .
0	would highly_recommend them .
0	after a lot of research_into the procedure for almost 0 year , i went_ahead with it .
0	i spoke with lots of people and they just loved it .
0	the treatment only took a few mins , and almost straight_away i could see the difference .
0	i have had some minor blurred_vision on one eye , but this has_been closely monitored and dealt_with .
0	all the staff have be great too .
0	this small procedure has made such a massive_difference to my lifestyle .
0	i just wish i had had it done sooner !
0	!

0	ive ordered 0 pairs of boots , a pair of shoes , 0 jumpers and a dress and i can_honestly_say im amazed with all of it . the quality is top_notch and at £ 0 per item its great . the only down_side is the delivery prices which can bump up the total but it was still great value for money .
0	hi ,
0	i just wanted to thank the team at parcel0go for making parcel sending so easy .
0	i sent a parcel with them in january and had no_problems , then received emails from them with offers so i logged on to send another .
0	i was wary as i had read a few negative_reviews on facebook and other review sites so was unsure , but i took a chance as i had no_problems with my first delivery .
0	i have to say the everything was brilliant :) i had a few queries when sending my parcel and wih my account so was in contact via the live_chat a couple of times and the team ( charlie , sammie , stephanie ) were very helpful and attended to my every need .
0	it is a very simple and easy process and i would recommend parcels0go to everyone .
0	the collection was made on the scheduled day ( by city_link ) at 0pm and was delivery was made to the recipient 0pm the following_day .
0	i am very pleased and advise anyone who_reads the negative_comments to ignore them , parcel0go are 0 *****

0	i was so impressed with watchfinder .
0	i first emailed to find out about selling my own rolex_watch , i got a response very quickly .
0	after ringing and speaking to a friendly , helpful sales_man , i arranged to view a new rolex at their maidstone offices the very next_day !
0	tom_holland was very professional and knowledgeable about rolex '_s .
0	the sales room is very secure and you are made to feel very welcome .
0	i would definitely recommend watchfinder and am already looking at more watches to buy .
0	thank_you .
0	he reservado muchos hoteles con esta empresa y nunca he tenido problemas , recomendable 000_%.
0	txtnation provides a 0st_class service in internet & mobile solutions , txtnation is not a company to keep_up with the times the goal is to be an industry leader & present new innovative products to the client .
0	nothing to complain_about with this company .
0	competitive_prices and promptly posted a packe to send my phones off in .
0	the following_day i got an_email to say my cheque had been posted and lo and behold there it was the following_day !!
0	highly_recommended !
0	ordered on thursday had envelope on friday , recieved phones on monday had money through same day by card payment overall no_problems unlike_other services who changed the price once sent phone back , very good customer service
0	the booking was okay i guess , despite_being promised £_00 off if i booked before a certain_date and then never materialising once booked !
0	the activities ( its a knockout ) and the nightclub were okay other than the fact we were strictly informed to be at club before 00pm for the guestlist entry and vip ( as paid for ), so we left the restaurant / bar in a rush to ensure we got there in time .
0	we got there at about 0 . 00pm only to be find no queue and the club not opening until 00pm , so we hung around like a load of desparados !
0	eventually we went in , didnt even ask for party name , as they werent expecting us , i enquired_about booking a table as i noticed some had been reserved , to which the manager explained that she didn_'_t know what had been promised by hen_heaven , but it was extra for a table reservation and she didn_'_t have any available , so instead gave_us a wristband each for an exclusive part of the club - whcih she , didn_'_t have to do .
0	we sorted_out surfing as an extra activity external to hen_heaven and glad i did , as it was only the activity organisers that seemed to do anything right !
0	very much doubt i would hen_heaven again , would rather source activities myself without the expensive overheads that hen_heaven do
0	my husband and i went_onto o0 because we had relatives and friends on that network so we figured we would save money .
0	i was so wrong !
0	they ended_up charging us double for four months until we finally got the problem sorted .
0	we have horrible_experience with the customer service .
0	one person tells you one thing while another person tells you something_else .
0	you can not change your tariff if you want to lower your monthly allowances and charges .
0	one customer representative was even argumentative and refused to transfer us to a supervisor .
0	they are very inconsistent .
0	my mum in law ended_up getting forced_into a contract with them due to a family_member not paying the bill in her name and they were absolutely awful when she called to try and get a copy of the original contact and change the tariff .
0	they charged her £_00 per_month just for 0000 minutes and unlimited texting .
0	absoutely no data was included in that .
0	even_though it wasn_'_t their fault that she had to continue with the contract they were no help what so ever .
0	the phone ended_up not working for a month and despite many time we helped her take it in to get fixed nothing worked and nobody helped .
0	we finally ended_up getting them to send her out a new one just to find out that that phone didn_'_t work either !
0	it was absolutely ridiculous !
0	do not use o0 as your network !
0	i don_'_t reccomend to anyone !
0	sign their contract at your_own_risk !
0	if you are a customer of o0 please make_sure to check your monthly_bill for unknown charges because they will not catch the error themselves !
0	i placed an order with precious_little_ones on the 00st_december_0000 for an east_coast cot_mattress , i rang on the 0nd_jan_0000 to delay the dispatch due to not being at the delivery address by the time it was expected to be delivered .
0	the girl i spoke to was very helpful , advised that the mattress was in the warehouse but she would get a delay put on dispatch until the 0th_jan .
0	i thought nothing of it , and and was looking_forward to receiving the mattress , however , i received an_email on the 0th_jan saying that there had been a stock error and that it would be another week until the mattress arrived in the warehouse .
0	i rang customer_services to ask what was going on , someone had made a mistake and not placed the mattress in the correct section and it had been resold ( not sure how that even happens ), i complained at the time but was not offered any compensation , until i asked for delivery charges to refunded .
0	i was expecting to receive on email on the 00th / 00th_jan to say that the mattress had been dispatched , instead i have received another email to say that the mattress is still not a available and that there was a problem with the manufacturers .
0	again i rang customer service to complain and ask for an explanation , but was given no more information , nor could i be told when the mattress would be available .
0	again i was not offered any compensation , other than an_apology .
0	needless to say i cancelled the order there and then , and will not be using precious littles one again , whilst their prices are highly competitive , it would appear you have to be prepared to wait .
0	very prompt service .
0	definitely use this company again
0	absolutely rubbish !
0	ordered on 0 / 0 / 00 and got goods on 00 / 0 / 00 !
0	no excuse , it '_s not even christmas !
0	never ordering from ' slow pharmacy ' again
0	i was referred this website from a friend and i '_m extremely happy with the pricing and the ease of shopping .
0	so many options !
0	excellent service , very professional , have already referred it to other small start - up companies like my own .
0	i ordered a dress according to the wrong_size_chart and one of the workers called me with in a few_days to make_sure that was truly the size i needed .
0	she was very patient with me while i figured_out what size i really needed !
0	they were very helpful and i would order from them again for sure !
0	booked three direct flights but the airline cancelled this flight ( now wondering_if they were ever offering such connection ).
0	first very frustrating thing were their emails sent to me in german ( booked flight through uk website , payed with cc registered in uk , gave uk contact number )...
0	however using google translator i managed .
0	called the customer " service " just to find out the obvious - the flight is not happening ...
0	they offered me an_alternative - instead of a direct , up to 0 hrs flight a full day connection with a change .
0	i refused ( who wouldn_'_t ?).
0	then i called them again to find out what my other options are and i could have chosen a refund that takes at_least 0_months or a voucher that will be usable for a future booking with them and issued within 00_hours .
0	i went for the voucher option as three passengers needed to travel and even_though i '_d have preferred not to use bravofly again .
0	no voucher after 0_days so i called again , explained all what happened again just to be told , that it will take longer because of the bank that doesn_'_t work on weekend .
0	excuse me ???
0	bank is not involved at all .
0	bravofly is issuing me a voucher in order to be able to use it for my next purchase ...
0	i had to explain the process to the customer " service " representative .
0	outrageous .
0	then she finally understood and promised to call me back that day after she investigates the matter .
0	no call back received , no email received ... now i '_m desperately_trying to get_hold of bravofly however with no luck .
0	their 0 - midnight uk number does '_t work at 00 : 00 neither does their french one .
0	their worldwide number only works if you provide your card number but after_reading other person '_s experience of facing card fraud afterwards i don_'_t feel like doing this .
0	to sum up anybody who is about to book with bravofly please think_twice as non - existent service and so frustrating approach is hardly to be seen_elsewhere .

0	the shipping speed is unbeatable !!!
0	great prices and a great selection .
0	i love supplement_warehouse !
0	very well_packaged and just what i was looking for , thanks !
0	thoroughly satisfied with the printer i bought and the customer service was fantastic !
0	delivery was great and any_questions i had were answered .
0	i ordered some mats but when they arrived the clips didn_'_t quite line up with the ones in the car .
0	i emailed in and got a response the same day .
0	they did some checks and admitted to making an_error .
0	new mats were sent out straight_away and they let us keep the old ones too so we could use them for our camping_trip that weekend as intended .
0	very pleasant to deal with , the mats are great quality and i was very pleased with the price .
0	we got the luxury version with a red_trim and they set the car off really nicely .
0	would definately use again and recommend to a friend .
0	from the 0st call to last everything was correct and efficient .
0	will def be buying again , great watch and great service .
0	thanks to lee for making easy .
0	i have used and recommended studio 00 at printing . com many_times .
0	their customer_services is second to none , the design work is excellent and the finished products of mine are still receiving compliments and feedback months after creation .
0	they are a truly brilliant firm and i would not doubt to recommend them and regularly do .
0	buy your meat snacks from jertong . com , seriously the best service ever and their prices are so cheap .
0	browse twitter cause there is always discount_codes for free_postage or 00_%_off !
0	placed an order with uksweets at quite a high value and had a terrible experience :
0	when i received it , it was all packed one item to a box so we received a stupid amount of boxes .
0	bags of sweets were split and taped back together meaning we couldn_'_t sell them .
0	items were out of stock even_though in stock on their website .
0	boxes were damaged so items we had sold in bulk had to be repackaged in our warehouse to avoid disappointing our customers ( see , that '_s good customer service on our part !)
0	sent items that had 0 - 0_months on the best before date meaning we have to either reduce them or sell them in bulk .
0	if you look around you can find the items a lot_cheaper and with better stock_levels .
0	overall , it may be the worst experience we have had with a wholesaler .
0	having met them at ife00 we assumed they would be a good company to work with ... obviously not !
0	i will not be ordering from this company again , their customer service is ridiculous and their products can be found cheaper elsewhere .
0	do yourself a favour , don_'_t buy from uksweets .
0	i '_ve_used face the future on three occasions and every time the product has arrived quickly and as advertised .
0	i would definitely recommend them for service , product quality and value for money .
0	thank_you !
0	if i ever do find a cheaper price , they beat it .
0	and i love getting all the free_shaker cups .
0	they have always had everything i was looking for .
0	it was easy to book with this site .
0	i was able to compare_prices and locations easily which was nice .
0	would recommend e0p to everyone , great value clothes and shoes , never disappointed .
0	also , customer service excellent , recently my parcel was ' returned to sender ' and e0p reshipped to me at no additional_cost .
0	will definitely trade with again .
0	i have used glasses_direct twice_now , purchasing a total of 0 pairs of glasses , and cannot_rate them highly_enough .
0	the free home_trials are brilliant and have totally taken_away the pressure of buying frames in the opticians and not beng sure if the glasses you have chosen even suit you !!
0	with the home_trial i can ask work_colleagues and friends opinions before commiting .
0	prices are amazing , so i can now change my style of glasses depending upon what i am wearing .
0	hassel_free transactions , i recommend all the time to friends and family !
0	!
0	sent flowers to a friend as a congratulations for her new job , she was delighted as she was sent flowers .
0	however i wasn_'_t as impressed as i had hoped i would be as they didn_'_t look like the photo on the webpage .
0	they looked rather slim and a bit old to be honest .......
0	fhr is a fabulous site , had heard about this site from martin '_s money tips email and it exceeded my expectations .
0	seamless customer journey thought entire web_page , does exactly_what it says on the tin , no robbing card charges like some other online ' extra ' ' holiday ' booking services and the customer service is fabulous to boot too , the competitors could do with learning from the fhr example for great customer service and customer experience , and i know this from experience !!!
0	i will , l without_doubt in future , only use fhr for my airport extra needs !
0	fabulous !
0	love to do_business with you again !
0	fab customer service - you should be proud !
0	twice hackers cleaned out my bank_account and although i got money back , it took far too long and they didn_'_t give any compensation , even_though it resulted_in bank charges and potentially late bills , luckily i had family to help out !
0	this is the second time i '_ve_used , pc_specialist , although it feels_like its forever before you receive product , its well_worth the wait , after all , it takes time to get things perfect !
0	and that is what my laptop is , using a lot of music software being_able to customise has_improved , my overall productivity .
0	i ordered a bouquet for mother '_s day day and wanted it delivered the day before , arrived as requested and was left in the porch with a card through the door , my mum was thrilled with the flowers .
0	i paid_extra to make the bouquet larger and added a vase for convenience all for under_£_00 .
0	will be using again , would recommend both company and product .
0	would definitely recommend etyres to any company or individual .
0	fast appointment after being_able to book quickly and easily online .
0	the technician kept in touch to let_me know when he would be arriving and he did indeed arrive within that time .
0	also a great price for the tyre only a couple of pounds more than quickfit but worth that and more to not have the hassle of getting the car to a centre .
0	i will be using etyres going forward for all my tyre replacement needs .
0	give them a try and you '_ll be pleasantly_surprised !
0	:)
0	mazuma offered me the best price for my t - mob pulse mini & after applying via their website , the packet arrived 0_days_later to post it to them & shortly_after i received confirmation & payment .
0	really excellent service , would reccomend & definitely use again when needing to recycle a mobile phone :)
0	amazing service from a company i used for the first time .
0	kept me in the loop when they were despatched and delivered .
0	will 000_% be using them from now on .
0	in fact everyone should use them .
0	despite placing an order over the weekend , come midday on monday i received an order update via_email_confirming my order had been despatched .
0	sure enough the following_morning , it arrived safe and sound .
0	as always , great job truffle_shuffle !
0	!
0	a nice and easy to navigate_around website and easy payment process .
0	item arrived 0_days after ordering as a ' signed for ' item with royal_mail .
0	the chocolates were well_packaged and none of the items were broken .
0	will be using the chocolate_trading company again .
0	shopping with the whisky_exchange has_been so easy , from finding what i wanted to going through the checkout_process and with delivery .
0	the item delivered was very well_packaged and the whole_process has_been totally effortless .
0	i would buy from the whisky_exchange again and would recommend them to everybody and anybody .
0	i couldn_'_t ask for a more easier transaction .
0	i order medication for my parents dog after being charged over the odds at the local_vets , not only as the medication cheaper , the customer service was faultless .
0	perfect in every way .
0	i will definitely be shopping here again .
0	i had an initial l ; oan and got caught in the spiral of paying back then taking another out to replace the money that quickquid have took .
0	after numerous_attempts to set_up a payment plan that both_parties were happy with i was advised by quickquid to change my payment date so that my account went into arrears and to call them to set_up a payment plan ( as they could only do this once i was in arrears ) after calling i received no help at all .
0	i just want to pay and get quickquid out of my life .
0	please take my warning and do not use them
0	good customer service and fast delivery .
0	good quality_merchandise
0	ordered 0 pairs of glasses on the free home_trial until i found the right pair .
0	then i got another pair free and 00_%_off .

0	my partner_loves the little samples you throw in
0	i purchased the maxfactor natural minerals foundation and i phoned up to complain_about it .
0	they describe it as being natural looking , which it isn_'_t as it is very shimmery .
0	brush sheds , feels dry on my face , not buildable either .
0	i can '_t get a refund because it '_s been used .
0	well , surely the customer is always right ?
0	customer service is shoddy as well .
0	i was told to take it up with maxfactor !
0	just useless !
0	my order hadn_'_t been delivered , only part , so phoned them up to see where the rest was .
0	their phone lines are terrible .
0	i phoned twice in the morning yesterday , no one answered both_times .
0	i was waiting for about 0 mins each time and then there was a ring and an_automated_message_saying they were closed .
0	it was 00am .
0	finally got through in the afternoon .
0	was told there was a problem with the supplier .
0	i was only told today that there has_been a problem for 0_weeks .
0	makes me wonder_if i hadn_'_t have phoned , would anything have been said to me ?
0	i phoned today and had the same problem phoning , saying they were closed etc .
0	when i got through i explained again my problem , and i was offered a refund of the lead and the rest of the order sent out .
0	i don_'_t know why the rest of the order couldn_'_t have been sent anyway .
0	but oh well .
0	got there in the end .
0	it '_s a shame , because i '_m a bit_iffy about using their service now as their website doesn_'_t say if something is out of stock .
0	i only went with envirofone because i had read they pay you the same day as soon as the phone has_been checked over .
0	i wouldn_'_t go with them again simply because of this .
0	i had to wait a week for my payment after they got my phone .
0	i actually phoned when i had an_email_saying they had my phone .
0	i waited_until_0pm for the money but i asked them why i hadn_'_t had it .
0	i was told it isn_'_t same day and loads of people had also said the same thing i did to them .
0	so sort it out and make it clear to customers !
0	i ordered some green_tea pills on a saturday and i waited_until weds and thought it was odd i hadn_'_t had an_email to say they had been dispatched .
0	phoned up and they said they had a problem with their supplier .
0	well , why have them available online ?
0	there were in stock when i placed my order .
0	it '_s now friday and i have them .
0	wary to order from them again .
0	i have this app on my phone and its great .
0	it '_s easy to use , it keeps a track of your orders so its easy to go back to see what you had last time .
0	really big range of restaurants too .
0	they '_ve got very repetitive promotions , normally in places that are not very known ... prices are ok but nothing exceptional .
0	you really have to look for it , to not miss a good promotion as there '_s only a real good deal once in a while .
0	this website has loads of choice , postage was resonable , and my items wre quickly despatched , great communication !
0	i would definatly order from them again !
0	as all the other reviews say this company is definatly a scam !
0	i just wish i had looked for reviews before ordering !
0	my experience is exactly the same as everyone_elses , i ordered from them , few_weeks_later order is still ' pending ' and have had no replys from my numerous attemps of contacting them .
0	i '_m so gutted that they are just able to get away with this =[
0	i have placed many orders with this website , and they never_fail !
0	postage is super quick and very discreet , they are very reasonably_priced , and they even offer a points rewards system !
0	i would definatly reconmend this website , and will_definatly be ordering from them again !
0	i received my order in less_than 00_hours after ordering .
0	it is a great service - so quick and efficient .
0	i even received a follow_up e_- mail .
0	thank_you
0	opodo is a great travel site with competitive deals .
0	i really enjoyed my holiday and felt i got a lot of bang for my buck .
0	i was pleased to be able to buy a ticket at the correct price once the event had sold out , from this trustworthy service .
0	the ticket arrived in perfect time and payment and everything went_smoothly .
0	ordered a wireless router , delivered promptly with no_problems .
0	i '_ve_used this company a number of times and never encountered any_issues .

0	absolutly hilarious , best weekend i will ever have !!
0	nude life_drawing was the best ice_breaker for my 0 families to integrate !!
0	followed_by a superb comedy_club , and dancing feet on at oceana .
0	the next_day was our lazy day in our spa and superb treatments at nottingham park inn with vicky at revive , lovely lovely lovely lady and treatments and knowledge of a high_standard .
0	then cocktail_making , will_definatly book again with the girls , wished i '_d known about this years_ago , the fun nights we could of had there !!
0	then last but definatly not least , the ladies only river_cruise ........ once in a lifetime and not for the faint_hearted !
0	hilarious .
0	the weekend could not of gone any better , every_single lady that came on my hen_weekend is still blushing and laughing til our sides hurt !
0	superb weekend !!!!!!
0	!
0	saved the day !
0	extremely easy to use , fast and certainly affordable .
0	very disappointed the item hasn_'_t arrived yet as it is a christmas_present and i am worried i won_'_t have time to exchange if not liked
0	i booked with hostelbookers four times over the last month as i have a big trip coming up and its great , so easy to see reviews in everywhere from sydney , brisbane , thailand and london , really helps take the guesswork out of booking accomodation for travel and i can do it in work without anyone noticing :) will definitely be booking any more accomodation i need with hostelbookers :)
0	items arrived quickly kept in contact with me so i knew what was happening with my item which i think is great .
0	i '_ve heard this company before but never gave it a chance , until i waslooking for a specific product and i came_across it on here .
0	this company seriously beats all other_companies , even amazon !
0	i saw that this website had the product i wanted for $ 0 more than on amazon but amazon had very pricy shipping ... this company actually fixed their price to lower_than $ 0 .
0	amazing !
0	i am for sure going to stick to this website .
0	it '_s by far the best !
0	brilliant system , always works well and it '_s easy to use .
0	my only_complaint is about some of the takeaways themselves , who give themselves good ratings .
0	has nick from devon really been to the same restaurant 0 times in a week , given everything 0 out of 0 but left no comments ?!
0	and he has only visited just after the restaurant has received an honest , negative_review .
0	what a coincidence !
0	shame there is no way to stop this .
0	but justeat is brilliant and we have found some really great local restaurants that we wouldn_'_t have known about otherwise :-)
0	we had requested a bespoke wedding_ring , a gold flat profile 00mm ring .
0	pretty standard .
0	we then wanted 0_star trek symbols added to the n , e , s and w points .
0	at every_step of the way we had email_updates as to what was happening and quick response times to our emails asking for updates .
0	all in all it took roughly 0_weeks from ordering to receiving the ring .
0	it was posted as received when they said it would be .
0	they are also very reasonable priced .
0	all in all i would recommend this company to anyone that will listen !
0	amazing !
0	recently_purchased 0 coby kyros tablets for our children from kenable - very quick delivery which was great , and the customer service ( particularly the after sales service ) was fantastic .
0	finally a company who treats the customer like they ' re kings !

0	top quality products and good prices cant go_wrong always at the end of the phone or message to answer any_questions quick reliable delivery to :)
0	excellent service , fast delivery and great products .
0	if you actually want the ability to use your phone i would recommend using a different service .
0	i have little to no signal at all times and have had numerous problems with the simple things like direct_debits .
0	upon ringing up customer service to try to sort_out my endless problems i have been met with rude , abrupt and ignorant customer service agents and i am yet to have any of my problems solved .

0	always a top choice to order games online
0	i have been needing a new computer for a while , for gaming , and i was recommended to use this site .
0	when selecting components , if something wasn_'_t quite right a pop up would appear and recommend a different component which would be more suitable .
0	pc_specialist would contact me an_email at each_stage of the order , whether for it having been built , in its testing phase and when it was ready to dispatch , which was also a lot quicker then i thought it would be , meaning i could get back to gaming faster the i thought !
0	the handbook provided was also very useful with tips on how to install and set_up my new pc .
0	everything about the whole buying experience and the product are top quality , and i would definitely recommend using this website to a friend !
0	product exactly as_described .
0	brilliant quality !
0	cheapest i could find online !
0	received within 0_days of payment !
0	very happy customer !
0	very poor customer service and terrible communication with customers !

0	i used lensstore as i needed my lens quickly for an event in the weekend and didnt_realise i had run_out and it usually takes a week from my optometrist .

0	it '_s the 0rd out of 0 orders i placed with hostelbookers .
0	i love them b /_c i can pay wt my debit_card and it '_s always super_fast and easy .
0	plus , i do manage to find great places to stay for cheap .
0	i '_m a budget traveler and it '_s important to find a good and cheap double room in a hostel rather_than pay triple as much in a hotel .
0	safe and sound , trust_worthy online market place which always innovate something extraordinary .
0	once i thought vodafone is the best . but now i know the best . o0 is the best . no doubts
0	why this mess ???????
0	?
0	alertpay ??
0	i do not have any word to explain my feelings guys .
0	awful alertpay
0	hostel_bookers always finds the best quality cheap hostels and they are the only reviews i trust , wouldn_'_t book anywhere_else .
0	never had any_problems with three .
0	the coverage is amazing and the contracts are great value !
0	i '_m a dutch person working in the uk .
0	i fly back and forth quite a few_times a year and always use klm instead of the budget_airlines .
0	the prices are fair and the stewards are exceptionally friendly .
0	i once had to book a very last_minute flight over the phone .
0	they called me back a few_minutes later for details meaning i didn_'_t have to pay premium call rates .
0	they never moan_about my luggage being a bit heavier_than allowed .
0	and the complimentary drink and snack is always very welcome ;)
0	thumbs_up for this amazing airline !
0	ordered some new fitness clothing while i was aware of their ' magazine and mug ' scam so i opt out .
0	i checked out when it was put back in my basket , only to find out when i got the confirmation_email .
0	really , guys ?
0	i don_'_t want your stupid marketing stuff ( let_alone pay for it ).
0	it '_s like shopping at the supermarket and have a employee sneakily put another product in your basket .
0	how is this even legal .. also , charging 0 . 00 for standard delivery .
0	no one does that anymore .
0	this is truly the last time i '_m shopping with this company .
0	i '_d rather spend a few_quid more to be treated with honesty .
0	they sold me a £_000 cage for the degus which turned_out to be way too small .
0	the reaction i '_ve got on this was that it is the rspca minimum .
0	which it is not .
0	they also seem to know nothing about them , constantly miss - sexing them so people end up with an unwanted litter .
0	it '_s pathetic to see the animals in the shops in very small cages , and them being willing to sell them per one degu .
0	always keep them in pairs .
0	please do not buy from , thus promoting , this shop .
0	i '_ve build my girls a really big cage , for less money than the cage pah sold me .
0	i started shopping with this company since they supplied ready made seed_mixes for degus .
0	my girls are on a special_diet which the seeds are an important part of .
0	my degus even think it '_s the best part ;) delivery was very quick , i expected it later in the week but received it on monday !
0	i '_m a very happy prime customer .
0	i order quite a lot of things online , as i work a lot and never have time to go to the shops .
0	i '_ve never had any delays and get all my order the next_day ( often in the morning ).
0	i ordered a video game a couple of weeks_ago which i thought got lost in the post ( not amazon '_s fault ).
0	customer service was great and i got a refund without hassle , it was back on my account within 0_days .
0	i eventually received the video game ( after two_weeks , while it was next_day delivery ) so i returned it .
0	it was really easy , printing out labels to put on the box and left it with collect_+.
0	i '_ve been using yodel on many different_addresses now and i have yet to find a bad delivery .
0	they are always on time and the delivery men / women are always very friendly and patient .
0	please consider giving this same service to all the other people which must '_ve had horrible experiences with you .
0	i never usually_write_reviews but felt_compelled to do so .
0	after terrible customer service from currys which_resulted_in me wasting a full day waiting in for a product which never arrived i decided to try ao .
0	the whole_process was quick and simple from order to delivery .
0	i was kept_informed of the status of the order and given a 0 week window for delivery however nearer the delivery time i received more precise information .
0	the order was received about 00_minutes outside my window but this did not concern me as i was kept up to date and knew the driver was in the area .
0	unfortunately the fridge_/_freezer i order was slightly_damaged ( small_dent in the side ) on arrival but i didn_’_t notice it until the following_morning .
0	i called and was given the option of a next_day delivery or a discount without_any query and gladly accepted a £_00 refund .
0	in days where the high_street store is diminishing it ’_s no wonder when internet companies provide such good service .
0	it ’_s sad but the fault has to lie somewhere ….. and i will be using ao in future even if curry ’_s has a better price !
0	tried to book our holiday on the website which was fine until i could only add x0 bags on with our monarch flight , but i only needed one .
0	called the freephone_number , got straight through to a lovely lady_who sorted it all out for us and amended the number of bags .
0	whole_process took minutes and i felt_confident our holiday was booked without_any_issues .
0	confirmation came through on email as soon as i put the phone down as promised .
0	fab customer service , i will be going straight to low_cost when booking holidays from now on !
0	thank_you :-)
0	i would never use any other company to sell my mobile , the webisite is easy to use , they pay for return postage and even send you the bag to post the phone in .
0	that arrived in a day or so and i recieved the money directly in my bank 0_days after i sent the phone to them .
0	they email you updates during the process so you know it has arrived with them safely and when they start testing the phone , and then when you '_ve been paid !
0	great company :-)
0	this website gives you lots of great options for exactly_what you select in the search bars and the reviews are very useful !
0	excellent coverage
0	should have been confused . com
0	fab pizzas
0	we would not use city_link ever again worse company in our all_aspects .
0	it would be too rude to state what we really think of them ..........
0	i have recently order the big moving pack plus from this website and i have only received part of the package with no tapes and no pen .
0	i have called their costumer services many_times during different days and no one pick the phone up .
0	this is cost me another 0 pounds to buy tape and of course time which was more important to me .
0	as i wanted to have everything ready at the same time , thats_why i have ordered them online .
0	i am not happy with my purchase at all .
0	hello friend !
0	what can i say ?
0	i just bought some paper
0	from ebuyer today !
0	it was cheap , what i need ,
0	and free , sent next_day !
0	why go_anywhere_else
0	when ebuyer is so great !
0	i was caring for my mum for years , with four children , and i needed a new_washing_machine but had no idea what would be best for me or my limited_space .
0	appliance direct helped_me with how to measure up , gave great advice and shipped me out a first_class machine for a fantastic price .
0	i wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else for my white goods now .
0	you just cannot go_wrong with them .
0	i bought my friend some flowers ,
0	from iflorist , a wonderful deal !
0	i thought how lovely they looked online ,
0	could not wait to see them for real .
0	however dear friends , guess_what !
0	the flowers , they never arrived ,
0	my friend stayed late at the office ,
0	so i tried and i tried and i tried ,
0	to ring the iflorist people
0	to ask them " where are my flowers ??"
0	i '_d had my conformation_email
0	and my friend waited at her work for hours !
0	but nothing !!
0	not even a phonecall !
0	!
0	they took my money , and me , for a fool !
0	i wish to now receive my refund
0	and i wish i hadn_'_t shopped there at all .
0	you could have at_least tried to phone me !
0	to let_me know that you guys had gone wrong !
0	yes ok there may have been trouble with snow and the weather
0	but then tell me this before the whole day has_gone !
0	you say it was down to the snow
0	and deliveries not made on time !
0	the for the love of god let your customers know ,
0	because that was your problem not mine !
0	i could have made other arrangements ,
0	now i '_m just a mum short of dough ,
0	please issue me now my full_refund
0	or its off to the papers i '_ll go !!
0	!
0	last friday i was trying to purchase eminem tickets for wembley_stadium .
0	after trying a few_times i managed to get some and enter my details and paypal details , only after i had completed this the web_page then came up the tickets were no_longer available .
0	00_minutes later i received an_email_saying that the tickets had been brought and the funds were leaving my account !!
0	by this time i had already brought some tickets from another website as viagogo had said they were not available .
0	i called viagogo straight_away and they refused to admit that something went wrong with the site and that they would not give me a refund and they told me the only way to get my money back was to re sell the tickets .
0	.
0	massive problem with this is i will loose money if i re sell the tickets and when i check the tickets i brought ( even_though they told me they had sold out !!)
0	it wont give me a row or seat number making it virtually_impossible to re sell them !
0	it also still says the tickets are not available . they also told me that the tickets were from a 0rd_party seller and that they have to contact them to get my money back which is absolute lies because the third_party seller does not receive the money for the tickets until 0_days after the event !
0	just to make things even better they e_mailed me today saying the time of the concert had been changed from 00 : 00 to 00 : 00 .
0	i called wembley to confirm this and they told me ever_since the concert was first announced it started at 00 : 00 and that viagogo had made a mistake .
0	so now even if i did decide to use the tickets i wouldnt be able to make the show at 00 : 00 because i dont finish work until then .
0	viagogo does have a disclaimer on the website saying that times are subject to change but im_sure this does not count when they out the wrong time in the first place and the actual venue has never changed the time !!!!
0	!
0	i want my £_000_pounds back and it looks like the greedy people at viagogo are just going to keep hold of it and mess me about for as long as it takesand fob me off with different reasons as to why i cant have it back every time i call customer_services .
0	stay well away buy tickets from direct site !!!!!!
0	!
0	my order id is 0000000 .
0	i am_furious .......
0	the only delay was at my endas i ran_out of ink to print the labels .
0	otherwise a fantasticly quick service with my money being in my bank within 0_days of sending the phone .
0	great to receive emails on where things were - order placed , received phone , processed , money sent etc .
0	i '_d use this again and have already_recommended it to a few of my friends too .
0	the picture of the costume didn_'_t do it justice .
0	i loved my wonder_woman costume .
0	it was the cheapest one i could find that looked half way decent so i was very happily suprised to have the best costume of the party .
0	i will be making all my costume purchases from here .
0	i ordered a 00 '_s groovy baby outfit with a wig and accessories all for a great price .
0	they were delivered in 0 working_days and were exactly how they looked on the website .
0	i would certainly order from fancy_dress ball again
0	i didn_'_t_hesitate to buy from watches0st . co . uk when i found they were selling the watch i had been looking for at less_than half the price of the high_street .
0	to make the buying experience even better , watches0st adjusted the watch_strap to my specifications perfectly and delivered it to me very promptly .
0	couldn_'_t be_happier with my purchase !
0	jennie , herts
0	i don_'_t usually_write_reviews for companies but i have to post about flubit , as they seriously have impressed me with their after sales service .
0	i ordered a product that developed a fault several months after it was dispatched .
0	the merchant had since stopped trading so i was slightly distressed , contacting flubit to hopefully rectify the issue .
0	not only did they keep me updated through email and then calls .
0	they were also able to sort the issue and sent a replacement on my request .
0	i am thrilled , will be sure to use them again .
0	thanks david and the rest of flubit !
0	was happy with the product , no damage and arrived quickly .
0	slightly annoyed with the courier as they left the parcel outside our door , no attempt made to ring the doorbell or knock on the door .
0	no idea how long my package was left there for .
0	if i could give no stars i would !
0	avoid this company !
0	i was on hold for 00_min and then they hung_up on me .
0	now i am 00_min and counting .
0	their bills are indecipherable .
0	their customer service awful .
0	their final_bill doesn_'_t show where the figures are coming from and i can '_t speak to anyone !
0	i love all of the zaggora products !
0	i '_ve really noticed a decrease in cellulite and now have much smoother skin than before using them .
0	the pants really do make such a difference to a workout and all of the products i '_ve tried are comfortable and the vivas are very stylish !
0	not only are the products great but the company is the friendliest i '_ve ever dealt_with .
0	the staff are lovely and very helpful .
0	i also love that they support charities .
0	cheapest ghd_styler and hairdryer i could find .
0	ordered on a thursday_evening and it arrived on saturday .
0	excellent service with next_day delivery at no extra_cost .
0	estimated time of delivery provided and a very polite phone_call 00_minutes before delivery which was great .
0	best price i could find online and they even registered the product with the manufacturer for me to ensure i get the 0 yr_warranty provided .
0	would most definitely use again and recommend .
0	superb service and print delivered in 0 working_days .
0	will certainly use again in the future and recommend .
0	used once , flawless booking .
0	no_problems .
0	would highly_recommend and will use again soon !
0	norman '_s provided an affordable slapstick for my sound effects table .
0	it was quick and easy to order online and the product was delivered very promptly and in perfect_condition .
0	i have made several purchases from this company , very impressed with the service and value for money , would recommend
0	really friendly service , very quick and reasonably_priced tyres would defiantly recommend
0	glasses0you are a great company , they have a great selection off glasses to choose from , something for everyone .
0	they kept me updated from the word go about my order .
0	the frames i order are fab , very funky !
0	i just love them .
0	i saved_myself a lot of money .
0	cant_wait to pick my next new pair of glasses form glasses0you .
0	i love o0 .
0	not ony do they have excellent coverage , they also offer top price plans for pay and go and pay monthly and rewards !
0	i have never had a problem with this provider and always reccomend to everybody .
0	i received the envelope etc through the post just 0_days after ordering them .
0	it took me a few_days to get it all posted back but i heard back from them the very next_day telling_me that my order had been processed and the money would be in the bank by the end of the day .
0	and it was .
0	i was very impressed at how speedy the whole trancsaction was .
0	have booked with holiday_autos many_times over the last few_years - as long as you read the t &_cs they always turn out well .
0	some of the hen_party arrived early as we were going to decorate it before the hen arrived .....
0	instead of a luxury cottage or barn we were promised plus getting hyped up by the pictures online we were shocked to turn_up and see a shed which was infested with a wasps nest two showers inside yet couldn_'_t shower in both at once .....
0	and in the middle of nowhere ....
0	although our butler in the buff ( christian ) arrived and cheered everyone up from the shock of the shed / barn he was wonderful i '_d say best part of the hen_weekend .
0	we were supposed to get free club_entry and vip treatment etc well when the hen_party turned_up at the nightclub not only did they not know who we were but the door staff insulted one of the girls to the point of crying her eyes out , when we told manager of this he stated it was only a laugh ..... not impressed ...
0	so after 00_mins of him faffing_about he eventually let us in and shoved us on a table in the hall way far away from the dj and vip ....
0	he was so rude it really upset all of us so we went back to our shed sorry barn house early ..... even had to book an ann_summers party during saturday because there was no activities available to us .
0	the money we paid for this shambles is shocking deffo not worth the money never using chillisauce again and safe to say i don_'_t think the other girls will either ....
0	what a flop ....
0	being an internet shopper for well over ten_years i '_m always a bit_dubious_about buying from sites that don_'_t have a massive reputation , but so glad i did !
0	was in dire need of some more pampers sensitive baby wipes but i like to buy the 00 pack ( anything less seems a waste of time ).
0	i googled it and ebitsi came back as the cheapest so i purchased them before google changed its mind !
0	at a tenner with free delivery i wasn_'_t going to complain - you can '_t even buy them that cheap at local_stores anymore !
0	( with exceptions to asda but where i live we don_'_t have one ).
0	my order was actually through ebitsi from amazon and delivery was so quick , super impressed !
0	!
0	avoid this company like the plague .
0	they are useless .
0	we waited for our internet_connection to be turned on for 0_months .
0	they kept saying " it will be on by next week "... gone to bt now .
0	bought my nephew a t - shirt for christmas and it was perfect .
0	lovely colour .
0	personalisation was good quality .
0	it also arrived nice and quickly too .
0	about 0_days after i ordered it on a 0 day delivery option .
0	very happy .
0	company asks for copy of passport to " validate " order .
0	when questionned , no response received ever .
0	they continue to send newsletters but never respond to emails - am unable to cancel my order now , they have left it in limbo and are not refunding me .
0	they took my money immediately after ordering and can not get through since , even on their phoneline .
0	absolutely_disgusting service , trading_standards will be informed .
0	do not use them .
0	this is one of my favourite websites to shop at , particularly for video games , but it '_s nice to see that they have branched out recently with music / films .
0	they are almost always one of the cheapest suppliers i come_across , and my recent pre_- order of the wiiu premium pack couldn_'_t have gone_smoother - they kept me updated with the process constantly , and i received it before the release date !
0	never mind the fact that it was the cheapest and , despite this , gave_me more reward_points than was being offered by game , for example , even_though it cost more at game !!
0	love this site , i think they are brilliant :)
0	get paid for buying !
0	amazing , easy to use , quick payout by most merchants esp .
0	tc themselves , excellent customer service :-)

0	never_heard of ebookers before and was going to book for my holiday , me and husband could only think of lastminute . com , expedia and opodo .
0	since i am a natwest credit_card_holder , i checked out their partners and found out ebookers is one of their partners , which means if i booked my flight with ebookers , i would have got my saving points from my bank .
0	this is how i knew about ebookers for the first time .
0	from browsing the holiday such as flight and hotel information on ebookers website to choosing the dates and confirming the booking , everything was very easy and smooth and i was very happy with the website .
0	however , i made a tiny mistake when i made the booking so i had to call their customer service up and i found out that their office is actually based in philippines .
0	spoke to two customer service staff and they were very friendly , helpful and professional , i am very pleased to see their high_quality of customer service .
0	overall , i am very happy with their service so far from booking my tickets online to their customer service on phone .
0	i shall be happy to book for my tickets and holiday again with ebookers in the future and would also recommend ebookers to my family , friends and colleagues who has not heard of ebookers before .

0	once order was received , we received a confirmation_email and follow_up which was good .
0	delivery was quick and well_packaged although we are missing the ' thank_you ' cards that should have arrived free with the order ( we received the envelopes just not the cards ).
0	my only_complaint would be that the finishing fold is not perfect .
0	i can appreciate that the card is pretty thick meaning that a crease fold would be difficult but i do feel this could be completed a little better .
0	00days and still no news on my phone .
0	send to be fixed for water_damage , no reply to my numerous_calls and emails , have only had limited contact via the instant_messaging service after much persistence .
0	i am losing money by not using my contract and fear my phone will never be returned to me .
0	please rotten apple give me some information , my order number is # 0000
0	awful company , terrible communication and service .
0	do not use
0	couldn_'_t be_happier with how easy everything was with me being a first time buyer .
0	i just left a vitamin shop and thought i would look online first and quickly found this amazing site !
0	the price was half the price here online !
0	many free products !!
0	wow !
0	!
0	i was super excited to receive my wonder_woman outfit ( which was brilliantly priced !)
0	and it came really quickly so i couldn_'_t_resist trying it on as soon as i could !
0	unfortunately , the costume was too_big for me so i put it back in the packet ( folded and sealed again ) and contacted jokers ' straight_away .
0	that was a good while ago and still no reply , usually customer_services are reliable and fast , so now i don_'_t know what to do with my item !
0	it '_s my 00th_birthday in a few_weeks so i hope i get an exchange by then .
0	not impressed at all with the service , despite its fast arrival .
0	very disappointed :(
0	the sizes are very strange , very long legs on trousers .
0	my cardigan had a very short torso and huge arms !
0	also , the label was cut out ?...
0	( what ' a that all about ?).
0	i would recommend buying small clothes and shoes a size larger , the shoe sizes are very strange and it '_s very annoying waiting for something to arrive and for it to not fit at all !
0	i '_ve been the same clothes / shoe_size for god_knows_how long , so it '_s definitely their sizes and not a growth spurt lol .
0	to sum it up , it '_s just market quality crap .
0	not a good start .
0	opened an account as had a voucher for get £_00 off if u spend £_00 or more .
0	brought a pair of boots which were faulty .
0	arranged an exchange but had to call again to bring price of boots back down .
0	then had to call again because very sent wrong_size .
0	exchanged but had to call again to put voucher back on .
0	after the 0rd time my boots were right but cost me around £_00 in phone_calls !
0	!
0	i found mazuma_mobile excellent .
0	it was easy to get a quote and sort_out payment details .
0	our money was transferred within two_days .
0	i would definately use this again .
0	hostelbookers takes the stress out of choosing a hostel with lots of options to help you find the right one and fast !
0	easy to pay and confirmation_email from hostelworld and the hostel was soon followed .
0	i will definitely be using them my entire trip .
0	easy to use and compare places to stay .
0	easy to pay , love it !
0	easy to use website , informative and provides all required info on immediate email_confirmation .
0	also £ 0 cheaper_than competitor who charged a booking_fee whereas hostelbookers doesn_'_t .
0	i purchased a tp forest double swing from wicken_toys .
0	on constructing the swing i noticed one of the wooden legs was split on 0 sides measuring 00cm and ending in a splintered point .
0	i contacted wicken and was told the split looked normal and wood will shrink / expand with the weather .
0	i sent a further e_- mail and photo '_s and had to contact wicken for an answer as they failed to reply in a timely_manner .
0	again i was told they will not replace the leg due to the splitting was part of the charactistics of wood .
0	as the leg was like this from delivery i do not except their answer of weathering .
0	i have had to tape the leg up to stop my children receiving splinters from it .
0	wicken state the swing should be checked for splinters and sanded down on a regular_basis , if i were to attemept to sand the leg i would have to sand half the leg away to remove the split and splinters .
0	very poor service and i would not recomend wicken_toys .
0	this has destroyed my faith in online purchases of such items .
0	ordered my ghd_straighteners on sunday_night and they were delivered , free of charge , by tuesday .
0	fantastic service , cheapest authentic ghds on the internet .
0	definitely would recommend this site to my friends and will use again in the future !
0	i like this website because they treat you like a friend but at the same time are very professional .
0	i really appreciate the cheap payment protection because my plans may very well change .
0	they always have lots of options and good info about each place .
0	until seeing all these reviews i have never_heard of a problem with them , i have bought tonnes of things off groupon and very please with what i have , i can understand some issues due to the different companies that advertise through_groupon , guess that '_s just bad_luck !.
0	i recently ordered x0 pairs of earrings with swarovski elements , only one arrived , so i emailed groupon and they were very helpful , my second_pair have come today .
0	yet again i am pleased , i have even purchased a getaway through them too which i was wary_about but i had a fab time !
0	thank_you groupon
0	i have never tried dieting before but after stepping on the scales and seeing 00st 00 i was very mad with myself !
0	so i ordered a 0 week deal on groupon ( split it with my mum ) so i have a 0 week one , which is the 000kcal a day .
0	i must_say that the first 0_days were hell !
0	i had headaches , felt dizzy , had no energy at all and just felt tired all the time , i was ready to give up at one point .
0	i just kept reading all the reviews on here and that kept me going !
0	its day 0 now and i feel fab !
0	woke_up in such a great mood , feel great , headache and everything else has_gone !
0	i haven_'_t really had time to exercise apart_from a 00_min_walk on the second day .
0	i love all the shakes esp .
0	choc mint !, and all the soups ( not tried veg yet ) the choc & orange bar is yummy too !
0	my delivery came next_day , for a little extra_charge , i was worried as a few reviews said delivery was slow , but it depends if you pay extra or not which i happily did !
0	i have lost half a stone in 0_days !
0	absolutely gobsmacked !
0	i couldn_'_t think of a better diet to be on , i was getting_bored of the shakes and leaving a quarter or so every meal time but today i have had the lot .
0	thank_you exante :-)
0	after people i know saying how good it is i thought i should try it .
0	we ordered a large margarita pizza and garlic_bread with cheese and it took almost 0 hours to get here .
0	when it did it was cold and all the cheese had been stuck to the lid as it had been chucked about in the car .
0	the delivery driver had his car music blaring out which woke my neighbours children and he left it on whilst he came to the house !
0	the pizza was so thin and burnt round the edges and it cost me a fortune !
0	never again would i order from here .
0	its awful !
0	after my son purchased a new yaris from pinkstones toyota stoke i felt_compelled to write a review !
0	!
0	it '_s that time of year to buy cars with the plate change , new models and good weather coming up ..
0	so i treated_myself to a lexs , then last weekend i went out to help my son buy his too .
0	he was interested in checking out toyota so as we ' re local we booked an_appointment .
0	we weren_'_t sure what to do as we had booked an_appointment without really being 000_% on what car to get .
0	after looking around ( a lot !)
0	my son eventually_settled with the new yaris .
0	the salesman was very patient , helpful and friendly , which of course always helps .
0	the new yaris also made quite an impression - it had a better quality interior than we had expected and the gadgets it offers as standard sold the deal !
0	my son went for a dark_green colour as he felt the red was a bit too ' girly ' for him ( lol )!
0	i do have to agree the dark_green does look good though especially with a slight tint of the windows .
0	while the new yaris is a fantastic car ( surprising just how much car you get for your money these days ) what i '_m really raving_about is the service .
0	i think top customer service is one of the most_important things these days and i really appreciate it when i get it .
0	everybody we met , from the girl on the phone initially through to our salesman jo treated us exceptionally well .
0	the 0 % offer on the new yaris was also a great deal , so my son has_gone for it and bought the car !
0	so thanks to all the staff for making the process thoroughly_enjoyable .
0	highly_recommended .
0	i '_d never considered lexus before and i '_ve previously always been drawn in by audi and bmw , but i saw the lexus stand in telford with the ct f sport on display and had a quick chat to the sales_rep .
0	the looks were sharp and sporty so it had plenty of appeal !
0	the zero road_tax also made this car very appealing to me !
0	after_seeing the car i just had to book my test_drive to find out what it was like .
0	lexus stoke was quite close so i went to them .
0	i had high expectations ; i like to buy the very best and change my car every couple of years .
0	the ct 000h f sport surpassed my expectations altogether - considering it '_s top fuel_economy , it had a very surprising high performance drive too !
0	i love high end gadgets and the f sport comes with plenty of gadgets as standard , so this was good too .
0	needless to say , i '_ve ordered my new car .
0	the whole_process has_been fantastic from beginning to end and the staff have been very helpful / hospitable .
0	i '_m looking_forward to the delivery of my new ct !
0	cheap and easy way to get ebay purchases that are far away delivered to your doorstep without_any bother .
0	i had an awkward pram and baby car_seat delivered and it came through in two loads absolutely fine - was very good service .
0	absolutely amazing band !
0	they sounded incredible and were all so friendly !
0	couldn_'_t of asked for more .
0	would highly_recommend this band as they made my wedding so special .
0	i wasnt_sure where i wanted to go so i called tina at verycheapholidays , from the start she was very helpful , thorough and friendly .
0	since booking my holiday ive had a few questions and her customer service has_been excellent .
0	i would recommend her to anyone .
0	used shiply to find quotes for moving a car from london up to bedford .
0	got the most quotes on shiply ( also tried other similar_sites ) and got a really good deal for moving the car :) feedback system is really good too .
0	slightly_annoying that deposit is non_refundable if anything were to go_wrong on the couriers end but all went_smoothly for me so no real probs :)
0	if it wasnt for amigos i would be in a mess so thank_you
0	i am unable to claim my £_00 discount_code , trying many_times to contact them but received no responses so far .
0	however , the first booking was perfect , everything went well .
0	hope that someone would help me sort it out !!!!
0	!
0	was worried shopping with them as had never_heard of them but the price of the car_seat was too good to miss !
0	i ordered sunday morning and received the seat on tuesday_morning by interlink_express .
0	fantastic service , would definitely shop with them again and will recommend the website to friends and family :-)
0	had an issue with the website ( my own incompetence !)
0	and my sos email was quickly responded to and staff were incredibly helpful .
0	the delivery came very quickly and was extremely happy with the product when i received it .
0	highly_recommend the website and will definitely use again as their price for this specific item was certainly a lot lower_than_anywhere_else .
0	very useful website , super easy to use and definitely better_than manually searching the net for the best price i can get for my old_phones - i didnt even know there were so many companies or that my old phone could be worth twice as much as some of the bigger named companies advertise on their websites .
0	would use again and highly_recommend
0	i recieved my order from tennisnuts fine , but i had an item missing ( wristband ) which i was then told it was out of stock .
0	i responsed to their alternative , but since then i '_ve had no repsonse back in ages !
0	we booked our_honeymoon via much_better adventures and were so glad we did !
0	the deal we got was matched_perfectly to our requirements and the team have gone to every length to ensure we found exactly_what we were looking for .
0	they have been so helpful and courteous , we are really grateful .
0	00 / 00 and we '_ll definitely be using the service again
0	i bought a pair of stella_mccartney sunglasses .
0	i saw them in a magazine and couldn_'_t find them anywhere in the high_street .
0	my pal reccommended red_hot and they had all the latest ranges .
0	i got my sunnys and another pair at a really great price .
0	it was really easy to order them and i got them earlier_than i expected .
0	can '_t wait for the sun to shine so i can get an excuse to buy more .
0	thanks red_hot .
0	excellent service from the first contact to delivery .
0	the web_site is easy to use & even_though we always order on line the orders are followed up by an_email from a ' real_person '.
0	the standard delivery is excellent - normally next_day .
0	.
0	never , ever go with three .
0	i had a pay - as - you - go contract with them .
0	my phone was stolen , so of course i asked them to cancel the sim and send a replacement .
0	they said it would be there in 0 - 0_days .
0	0_weeks_later the sim had still not arrived .
0	i called again and asked what was going on .
0	i was given some piss - poor_excuse about the request not going through , or technical_difficulties or some such rubbish .
0	i then told them that i wanted to cancel my contract with them , and was told " oh that has to go through as a separate request , we can '_t do that until the cancellation of the other request goes through ".
0	they promised to ring me within 00_hours to confirm it , which of course didn_'_t happen .
0	i then rang them again and told them to give me my pac_code .
0	long_story_short , i was passed from person to person , none of whom had a clue about any of my details or the story .
0	you spend_ages explaining everything again and again ( apparently , they don_'_t possess such advanced technology as customer records and databases ) and they ask you to repeat your number each time .
0	i told them that they should have records of my calls , and should know exactly_what had happened , and that i was with my friends at the time , and telling them all never to take out a contract with three .
0	( this was true ).
0	i also told them i would post this experience on every social_media and reviews site that i could find , hence this review .
0	and then , after much wasted time that i '_ll never get back , when i finally got my pac - this actually made me laugh out loud - the woman had the gall to say " oh if you want to stay with us then we '_ll give you three_months ' free service "!
0	not if you paid me , you poor , unfortunate employee of this scummy company !
0	i reckon they know perfectly well that people realise they ' re awful , so they put the hooks in and make it as impossible as possible to cancel your contract .
0	absolutely_disgusting .
0	avoid them like the plague !
0	i ordered from this company a few_times and have had no_problems .
0	i am always happy with the prices and the delivery times .
0	very prompt delivery and super cheap prices !
0	i was a little_dubious after i had purchased the glasses as it was coming from hong_kong , i wondered_if it would take weeks for them to arrive and whether they would look as good as they did on the website .
0	i have to say i very rarely_write_reviews but thought i would this time as i was really happy with the goods and the service received .
0	i received a text off dhl the day after i had ordered them telling_me they were on their way and a link so i could monitor them , however 0_days_later they arrived !
0	thats quicker_than amazon !
0	also the glasses were gorgeous and definitely authentic .
0	overall im thrilled with the price i paid for them now .
0	id recommend this company to anyone .
0	great selection of glasses - i ordered 0 pairs of vivienne_westwood glasses , they were excellent value .
0	the customer service team were quick to reply to my questions .
0	kensington_tea co . was an simple , easy to use ( especially for a green_tea novice !
0	), and great looking website .
0	the site has a great range of contemporary products that also looks stylish as well as functional , it was hard to choose .
0	but the advice on the site allowed me to get the right product for me .
0	would thoroughly_recommend the kensington_tea company for any loose - leaf tea related purchase in the future !
0	the quality and price of the outfits are very good .
0	the service is very efficient .
0	i needed to return my outfit to change the size and i did not have any_problems .
0	i would recommend using this website and i would use them again .
0	the only_criticism i have of hostel_bookers is the name - because it isn_'_t just a site for hostels !
0	sure , i have booked some excellent hostels using the simple , quick and no - fees booking_system , but i '_ve also used it to book top - end hotels and apartments .
0	the reviewing system i '_ve found to be very reliable , and the website seems to find cheap prices which other comparison_sites don_'_t pull up .
0	thank_you hostel_bookers !
0	bought wii balance board ( black ) + wii_fit plus solus game and from the ordering process right up to the delivery was excellent i would recommened to my friends and family and would definetly use this company again .

0	first time buyer with musclefood and i was really impressed with the service .
0	i was a little_hesitant with ordering meats online although glad i did .
0	everything came on time and the order was complete .
0	there was one slight_issue with a packet of chicken accidentally splitting open but the correspondence with the team at muscle_food was exceptional and they provided me with a refund which was in my account the next_day .
0	will definitely use again !
0	great service !
0	i know it sounds too good to be true but it really really is .
0	had no_issues with them .
0	as long as you read the terms and conditions of offers you will be pleasantly_surprised at extra_cash coming in !

0	i called away0 as i had been to vegas before and the trip was booked through them although i never deal with them directly , it was done through a friend .
0	michelle dealt_with our query and she was absolutely amazing , she was very patient and accommodating .
0	we wasn_'_t sure if we wanted to just do vegas or a multi_trip , we gave michelle all the different options we wanted to explore and she gave_us quotes for every option possible and ensured she found the best possible price for us !
0	as we both work full time , we dealt mostly with michelle over email and she was very quick to respond to us , the service overall was just brilliant !
0	in the end we decided to do las_vegas and san_francisco , the trip is booked for april and we can '_t wait !
0	!
0	i would definitely recommend away0 to friends and family

0	got my photots back to day they are of a high finish , will use again
0	i was on a rolling_contract and called the vodafone custmer service to see if they could give me better deal .
0	they saved me £ 0 per_month and double the mins and text allowwanc per mth . all that and it only took 0mins to do .
0	the delivery was terrible , i paid for next_day delivery but my nicece never recived them they said i that they left them in the porch .
0	the porch is an open porch near to the main path so if they did deliverer the flowers anyone could of stolen them . on the postive side they did redeliver some new flowers but a few_days_later and i still paid for next_day delivery .
0	the flowers were beauiful .
0	i got a new pair of shoes last_week worn them once and they fell_apart so i took then back to the havent store the manager was very ride and refused to give me my money back she could not resell them again , which of course she cant resell them they fell_apart . better custmer service needed

0	!
0	i cannot express how much i absolutely_adore this site !
0	i use tcb to buy things as i usually would so it '_s not like i am going out of my way or buying things that i usually wouldn_'_t , except i use this portal to link to my chosen shop / service and get_rewarded handsomely in doing so !
0	click the link below to start_earning :)
0	this company is diabolical !
0	do not order from them .
0	they are scammers .
0	i placed my order for a samsung_galaxy mini on 00 / 0 / 00 and they have still not even dispatched the item .
0	they keep giving me excuse after excuse .
0	i have emailed and called on numerous_occasions .
0	they keep_fobbing_me off saying they have an issue in fulfillment .
0	basically they are taking customers money in good faith saying they have adequate stock_levels but in reality they are building up a back log of orders so that they can purchase the phones when they have say 0000 orders at rock_bottom prices .
0	they are liars and crooks !!!
0	do not deal with valuebasket .
0	i wish i had found this site before i purchased the phone .
0	i was so bowled_over by the fantastic deal on offer that i should have thought logically , if something seems too good to be true it '_s because it is .
0	i wish i '_d of paid the extra £_00 with amazon now .
0	i '_m reluctant to cancel the order because i have a feeling it will take a lot of hassle and time to get my money back .
0	so i '_m just waiting it out .
0	they have me stuck behind a rock and a hard place .
0	very pleased with my glasses , great frames at a decent price .
0	really helpful and efficient staff who responded quickly to my queries .
0	received my glasses quickly even_though outside the " standard " prescription range .
0	i will_definately by from eyewearbrands again and recommend them to friends and family !
0	would never book with this holiday company again , after care service is very poor .
0	complaints_dept is a joke !!!!!!!!!!
0	!
0	having_spoken to many garages to replace a run flat_tyre i then rang e_- tyres who quoted a far cheaper price and came round the next_day to my house to replace my tyre .
0	so convenient for me me with kids running around .
0	really friendly guy_who showed me all the safety checks when he had finished .
0	i would definitely recommend them .
0	i took the plunge and after looking for weeks i found them on google i decided to order two ralph_lauren long_sleeve polo_shirts and was amazed with the quickness of delivery and could not believe the fantastic quality of the stuff they had the supplier numbers in the washing label ( i expected not the best quality probably returns or something because of the price ).
0	anyway to cut the long_story_short i was that pleased i just ordered another four items on the same day .
0	i regret to say i wasn_'_t treated nicely at all when i contacted anyvan via the phone
0	they ladies i spoke to was just simply too rude
0	sono rimasta molto colpita da sunglasses_shop .
0	il catalogo è vastissimo e comprende tutti gli occhiali più belli e alla moda .
0	i prezzi sono i migliori che si possano trovare sul web e la spedizione è velocissima , con un ' ottima cura nel packaging .
0	sicuramente acquisterò ancora su sunglasses_shop !
0	grazie , sono molto soddisfatta !
0	i have been using chitoro for years_now , i think probably 0 , and they have been fantastic .
0	really gone out of their way at times to help .
0	exceptionally fast service and never had a snag yet , despite my requests constantly changing and being a little complicated .
0	they are always_willing to accommodate and get the job_done quickly .
0	can '_t speak highly_enough of them .... highly_recommended !
0	there is quite a theme going on with regard to wowcher '_s poor service .
0	it seems that woucher should be more choosy about the companies they are partnering up with !
0	same here !
0	paid in good faith but no goods received !
0	simply not good enough !
0	if enough of us write to watch dog we could save other people the misfortune of being out of pocket and unnecessarily stressed by wowcher and it '_s affiliate companies .
0	it is a shame for the good companies that wowcher partners with ; might their reputation be affected ?
0	was easy and delivery of medication was quick .
0	ordered a table_lamp " parkbrass , alchemy , £_000 " from here on monday_evening , it was delivered on wednesday - perfectly packaged , i was worried the large shade may get squashed in transit - i need not have worried .
0	competitive_pricing , i did a google_search prior to ordering and the price was the same as all other on - line stores .
0	would recommend .
0	delighted with the santana tv_unit and nest of tables received yesterday - great design , quality build and competitively_priced .
0	items were well_packaged and delivered within the promised 0 hour time_slot .
0	the tv_unit was out of stock when ordered so delivery was longer_than usual , but worth the wait .
0	this was my first time selling a mobile phone over the internet so i was a little_nervous .
0	i read a few reviews of different companies and fonebank seemed to have consistantly good reviews .
0	their prices for phones are good but not the highest on the web - although i hear some of the other_companies quote high prices on their website then when you actually send your phone they knock it down by 00_% saying it '_s not in perfect_condition - who '_s phone is by the end of a contract period !
0	anyway no such issues with fonebank , sent phone recorded delivery , the next_day received email_confirmation they had received phone and set_up a bacs_payment , £_000 was in my bank 0_days_later - top service - thank_you !
0	!
0	i placed an order for a remedy for chickenpox .
0	now told they have issues with the supplier .
0	not acceptable to me as selling this type of medice you would expect it to arrive faster given the nature of what it is for .
0	totally unnaceptable , wish i had read_reviews before i ordered .
0	shiply provides a great service to everyone who needs to deliver goods or to move houses .
0	a very easy system where transpoters bid for what you request .
0	i used it 0 times already and everything always went_smoothly .
0	very good quality invitations - fast service , free printing of guest lists is excellent .
0	great customer service .
0	would definitely recommend .
0	this was my first order from yorkshire aquatics , the website was easy to navigate and checkout was simple .
0	my order was with me within 0_days !
0	i was really impressed by this !
0	one item that i received was wrong , so i emailed and this was rectified_immediately , and i had a replacement item sent , which i again received really quickly .
0	overall i would say very good :)
0	wednesday : registered phone with mazuma
0	thursday : posted phone to mazuma
0	friday : mazuma received phone and issued argos_voucher
0	saturday : got my voucher in time for a shopping trip !
0	brilliant , fast service from mazuma .
0	other_companies that i have used can take up to two_weeks to assess the phone and issue the voucher , i had this voucher two_days after_posting my phone .
0	amazingly speedy !
0	and i '_d definitely use them again .
0	0_* service from mazuma !
0	i find sold my phone was quick and easy
0	we were in venice for one week , and we had not booked any hostels in_advance .
0	so we arrived in venice and had no clue_where to stay , all hostels we found were already full .
0	we met a guy_who let us use his notebook to check in hostelbookers . com , and we easyly found a really nice dampingsite near venice for a really cheap price !
0	we stayed there for two nights and we were really happy about this accomondation !
0	thank_you hostelbookers for saving our trip !
0	this was our first time using hostelbookers and the process was very easy .
0	the reviews , information and pictures of each location was very helpful .
0	five_stars - i have sold three phones now and the service has_been fantastic every time .
0	i will only use mazuma for selling my phones in the future .
0	thank_you for your excellent customer service mazuma
0	we got to our hotel in bath and found out that this company had cancelled our stay and not even bothered to tell us !
0	we had received a confirmation_email but the hotel had received nothing from hotel_voucher_shop about our booking .
0	we tried to ring customer service but it is closed on a weekend which is pretty ridiculous for a travel company !
0	we rang an_emergency_number for gullivers but they were pretty unhelpful and refused to speak to my boyfriend who made the booking .
0	luckily we were able to get another room at the hotel so the weekend wasn_'_t ruined .
0	so in summary , terrible customer service , we are in the process of making a complaint and hopefully we will get our money back and reimbursed for the voucher we used .
0	great customer service at a good price .
0	would definitely recommend using them .
0	their mini crane and operator have helped massively on our project .
0	i ordered a printer on 0 / 0 / 00 , received the order acknowledgement and patiently_waited for delivery .
0	today , 00 / 0 / 00 , still nothing received so i checked the tracking online and nothing was found so i called up and was told that the order placed last_week did not go through properly at their end and i '_ll need to go back online an re - order .
0	ok , a bit of a faff and a shame that no - one followed this up with me for over a week , but i go to the site and select the same printer & it is now 00_% more_expensive .
0	boo !
0	poor me , so no sale after all that & i '_ll have to go somewhere_else now .
0	i have used bondara for ages as they are the best .
0	i have always received my orders on time or early and find their service excellent .
0	they offer so much variety
0	was really happy with the service from prezzybox .
0	i order several items all for gifts to other people and felt the ease of their website was good , the options for delivery were good , the actual arrival time for delivery was exceeded ( always happy with that !)
0	and the products themselves were perfect & of good quality .
0	found website really easy to use , postal_bag came through quickly and money went into my account with no_probs ... deffo use again !
0	hello im playing fifa_00 world_cup and i been buying fifa points to unlock players but is expensive .... i have bit concern about where to buy try to aboid an scam ..... but finally i choose mooga by recommendation and is great ... i bought 000000k and i got it in 0 minutes .... highly_recommend it guys and going to buy more i finished my coins already hahha .
0	im a new customer that made a booking with you guys , everything was fine till i departure , never got the email at departure to rate the hostel , i was so happy about it but after a week i decided to contact hostelbookers asking about it , someone called hollie reply_saying email was sent , check your spam and they even said if i didnt book with them wont get the email what a retards ....... i eamil back and never got and answer .... customer service suck im wondering_why some hotels have tons of rates and the other ones dont ?
0	do you have special preference for some hostals ?
0	do you have another contract with them ?
0	thats what i think after this expirience ..... but what its funny is at my booking they send me this link to rate hostel_bookers they are more more worry to be rate than the hostels so taking this link the only one you sned me im goona rate you !!!

0	excellent service .. super_fast delivery .. will use again .. thanks
0	good communication from the start i was nervous providing i . d to a company had never dealt_with before but was reassured the reasons_why .
0	good delivery arrived speedy after payment , box had a little hole in it but considering the weather_conditions was okay with this .
0	the second game was available on download at xbox_live which i didnt know
0	another pointer for coolshop - i wasnt aware that the plug would be foreign three point , therefore needed an_adapter to use in the uk luckily i checked the product before wrapping
0	would use the website again
0	excellent staff all very pleasant , welcoming and knowledgeable but not boring !
0	!
0	we got on near our hotel at victoria took red_route , live_commentary fantastic we enjoyed that much stayed on all the way around then went round again to get off and see sights !
0	!
0	brilliant value and funny commentary not too in depth to loose interest .
0	great to see london at a different angle , then in contrast to take the river thames tour and see the sights from below , it was fab !
0	!
0	my 0year_old didnt want to go on a bus_tour after an experience abroad last_year where we were listening to all different_languages and very boring tour , half way round i asked if he wanted to get off ' no way ', so i guess that sums it up .
0	good idea that different nationalities can plug in earphones to listen to the tour in their language .
0	great photo opportunity , bet some londoners havent_seen all the sights we saw in a matter of 0hours !
0	!
0	the stops are very easy to see and i asked the staff about the latest i could travel back to reach my destination all helpful , plus can book other trips with the staff , got my london eye tickets from them .
0	brill !!

0	never any_issues fantastic service
0	kvaliteten og farver kan variere fra det man ser på_hjemmesiden til det produkt man modtager .
0	deres størrelser i både sko og tøj er_ikke til at stole på .
0	jeg_har i alt bestil 0 par sko fra nelly , alle i str .
0	00 .
0	de tre af parrene var for små , svarende til ca .
0	en 00 , og et_par var nærmere en str .
0	00 .
0	én ud af tre kjoler bestil på nelly har_været helt anderledes i kvalitet , farve og størrelse end det jeg så på_hjemmesiden .
0	en_anden kjole og snydt med formen på ærmerne .
0	grunden til at nelly får tre stjerner , er den gratis og hurtige levering_og at deres produkter i knap halvdelen af tilfældene lever op_til forventningerne .
0	jeg_vil til enhver tid advare venner , der ønsker at_bestille varer hos nelly .
0	jeg_har handlet på asos utallige gange og_jeg_har altid været yderst tilfreds .
0	produkterne lever op_til forventningerne ud fra billederne og hjemmesiden er_meget overskuelig og med_en_god søgefunktion .
0	de_har et_stort_udvalg af gode , kendte mærker til meget lave priser ( det billigste jeg_har set indtil nu !).
0	ordren blev afsendt dagen_efter bestilling og_jeg modtog pakken 0 hverdage efter ( de lover levering på 0 - 00 hverdage ) - i forsvarligt emballage .
0	portoen udregnes efter størrelse og vægt , jeg betalte ca .
0	00 kr .
0	for 0 mellemstore produkter - meget rimeligt !
0	produktoversigten er efter min mening ikke så god .
0	men tjek det ud - det_er besparelsen værd at bruge lidt ekstra tid på at finde det man leder efter !
0	absolutely_shocking customer service - from order date to delivery took 00 days - still have not had any form of apology from the company - have asked for a refund of my delivery as a gesture of goodwill and they have refused .
0	prices may be good - but make_sure your prepared to wait a long time for delivery and expect bad customer service .
0	for someone such as myself who is in no way a it person at all , i am always apprehensive using computer repair places , feeling like they see me coming and rip me off .
0	so i took a chance with the service team .
0	it has paid off , i liked the personalised service you get right from the first phone_call .
0	then when the engineer came to my house to diagnose the issue he moved appointments around in the day so he could get to my house earlier as i had night_shift that night .
0	i was very appreciative of that .
0	he was friendly and i felt comfortable inviting him into my home .
0	also the best part is you see them doing the work then and there so you know what the labour cost is going to be .
0	absolutely recommend them .
0	i am not a heavy lifter , but i do often frequent the gym and stay in good shape with a combination of proper supplementing and diet .
0	what i really like to do is shop online ....
0	which works out really well for my boyfriend ( who is heavy into lifting ) when it comes time to place our giant , combined supplement order .
0	we always order together but he only asks two questions ; ' what did you get ?'
0	and ' how much was the total ?'
0	i guarantee that since i started placing the whole order with supplementwarehouse . com , he has_been surprised by my response to that second question on each_occasion , after_hearing everything we were able to order for that amount ...
0	hands_down unbeatable prices .
0	yes , there is a shipping cost , but its simple to justify having to pay for shipping when i know that it doesn_'_t compare to what i '_d be paying elsewhere to get my supplements .
0	i don_'_t need to ' ask ' for special pricing , i know i am getting the best deals !
0	additionally , i continue to order from supplementwarehouse . com because of their always up - to - date selection of products and fast shipping .
0	a one - stop_shop for everything you need to ensure you are fueling your body with all the right things , whether you ' re male or female , working on gaining muscle or just like to stay in shape .
0	based on their prices , efficiency , and selection , i always choose supplementwarehouse . com as my go - to stop for supplements and i would highly_recommend their products and service to anyone .
0	i ordered a brand_new flash yn - 000 from ebay , it was sealed and under_warranty .
0	when i got the flash i found out it was faulty , it wouldn_'_t turn on most of the times even with brand_new batteries .
0	just after three or four uses , i thought i should get it checked since it was under_warranty .
0	so i sent an_email to hkyongnuo service and got a reply within a day or two to send the flash to mr . william lin at their hongkong office .
0	after that i kept on sending them emails to inform_me when they receive my package .
0	i got a reply after about two months saying that they still_haven_'_t received my package .
0	then after waiting for almost 0_months i decided to contact royal_mail ( uk ) to file a claim for lost parcel .
0	fortunately , i found william '_s skype id from his email , added him and found him online .
0	he then told me that he had received my parcel a few_days ago and it was sent for repair .
0	he also said that i would have to pay them 00 usd for sending the flash back to me .
0	i paid it right away and got my flash back within a few_days .
0	when i opened the package i found out they forgot to send the diffuser and the flash still had the same problem .
0	when i emailed william to send the diffuser back , he said he '_ll send one for " free " if i am willing to pay the shipping cost .
0	i replied_saying that it wasn_'_t my fault since he forgot to put the diffuser in the box and i have already paid the shipping cost , since then i haven_'_t gotten any reply from them .
0	take my advice , never buy anything from yongnuo and don_'_t even hope for good or even satisfactory customer service .
0	i ordered a pair of teva_sandals from the site on tuesday around midnight , received a confirmation the next_day that my order was processed and on thursday at 0 a . m i received the parcel .
0	excellent service , highly_recommended !
0	absolutely_faultless and outstanding service , very highly_recommended !
0	prices are great , some very cheap some average but nothing ridiculously overpriced .
0	packaging was excellent , bottles are very securely_packed and should be safe from even the most clumsy postman .
0	delivery time was also excellent , arrived in very reasonable time and i was kept_informed about my order which was also much_appreciated .
0	overall an outstanding and honest company and comes very highly_recommended from me .
0	i bought some shorts for a birthday_present for my dad and it didnt come in the waxx tin or with a keyring which i have recieved with all the other purchases that have been made by my family .
0	i called consumer advice and reported this company since they had not delivered an item i ordered in february and a few_days_later i had a call from trading_standards .
0	they told me they were in contact with decuisine , took my order details and said they would arrange a refund .
0	do report them and make_sure you get your money back !
0	i '_ve wanted some brushes from crownbrush for a while and when there was a 00_%_off code i thought it would be rude not to !
0	i am really pleased with the brushes i bought ( all eyes on you set ) as they are such good quality , especially for the price .
0	the best brushes i '_ve ever_owned !
0	i also bought the blusher_palette which was a lot bigger_than i was expecting it to be which was a bonus .
0	the colours are lovely , very natural and pretty palette .
0	i '_ve recommended to many friends already and i will be buying christmas_presents for friends and family also .
0	thank_you crownbrush *****
0	this website not only matches competitors prices but will discount the lowest_price an additional 0 % !!
0	i will buy all my wellness products from this site !
0	well firstly on arrival in france my transfer never actually turned_up at the airport !
0	i rang all numbers listed on my booking confirmation and received no answer which_resulted_in us paying 000euros in taxi_fare to the hotel .
0	the next_day we rang the transfer company who told us we should have been given different information on the pick_up off resort_hoppa ( which we didn_'_t receive ).
0	he then told us he would email resort_hoppa and tell them we need to be refunded .
0	on returning home i rang resort_hoppa to complain and ask for a refund and they told me to email their customer_services ( who you can '_t contact via phone ).
0	i have since emailed and phones numerous_times and been told that it will be delt_with shortly .
0	they have even used excuses such as ' our customer_services team has just moved from spain to england so things are taking a bit longer ', which was a lie because in the phone_call prior to that the woman said customer_services were in the next room to her !
0	!
0	i wrote the complaint in mid_october and still have received nothing back now !!
0	do not use the company unless you want to be stranded at an airport and waste your money !!
0	!
0	my husband and i '_ve been using supplements for quite some time , we kept pouring money into it until we found you guys .
0	thanks for the great deals
0	would highly_recommend them and would use again .
0	i ordered a dress but was too small so i sent it back and my refund was paid back very quickly and with no_hassle .
0	instant search result , quick and easy processing , sensibly designed email_updates providing up to date status of the process but with sufficiently discreet banners .
0	brilliant service all_round , online sh !
0	is impeccably reliable , so much so that i don_'_t need to go to the store at all .
0	double0tickets was a reliable service , stressfree ...
0	i was pessimistic because i have been conned ... double0tickets was a phone_call away , delivered tickets very safely , and were genuine tickets !
0	fantastic service with fantastic time at the gig !!
0	i willmost definitely use this service again .
0	julie s .
0	have never used simply_games before but they are now on my favourites_list !
0	delivery was ver quick and great customer service .
0	thank_you
0	they delivered the flowers and they were lovely but they delivered them on the wrong date !
0	booked a collection for monday and was told they would collect between_0am and 0pm so i made sure someone was home all day .
0	it got to 0pm and still no - one had been to collect the parcel , it is incredibly annoying to wait around all day and not get the parcel collected .
0	at 00pm i opened the front_door to let my friend out , there was no card on the doorstep yet in the morning i found a card on the doorstep ( they couldn_'_t even be bothered to put it through the letterbox ) saying that someone had attempted to collect and that no - one was in .
0	which is an outright lie .
0	the card hadn_'_t even been filled out with details of parcel , delivery address , if they would return to pick_up another time or day .
0	so i called yodel and they informed me that someone attempted to collect my parcel at 00 . 00 the night before which is not only a lie but it is also outside of the time of collection they stated .
0	if you can avoid it , don_'_t use this company to collect parcels .
0	completely_incompetent and unreliable !
0	i received the package in 0_days ..... in italy so i '_m impressed .
0	thank u so much !
0	product arrived 0_days after ordering as planned and was much_better value than other_places i looked , would use again
0	we ordered from worktop_express because ikea didn_'_t sell the lengths we needed .
0	we thought it would be much more_expensive but it actually worked out cheaper and was by far better quality .
0	makes our standard ikea kitchen look really premium .
0	delivery was great , i got a call an_hour before hand so i could go home to sign .
0	make_sure you allow time to oil a couple of times before it goes on .
0	from the moment i spoke to robert ( our holidays_please representative ) my anxieties about booking our dream_honeymoon were forgotten .
0	we were unsure of where we wanted to go and robert gave_me advice and information each time we changed our mind about the destination .
0	robert was very knowledgable about all the destinations and got back to me very quickly with hotel and flight options ( which were always within our specified budget ).
0	he was honest about what we could and couldn_'_t afford , to enable_us to have the luxurious honeymoon we wanted .
0	we decided on mauritius and got it all booked up very easily with robert .
0	even when , 0 month before_departure , our orginal hotel decided to close for refurbishment , robert had already got 0 hotel options for us to choose from .
0	it turned_out to be a blessing as the hotel we chose , with roberts recommendation , was absolutely superb and everything we could have asked for and more !
0	we used the gift list service for our_guests which worked_perfectly .. our_guests commented on the ease of use .
0	i have no_hesitations about recommending holidays_please and using them again for ourselves !
0	i initially called up webtogs to get some advice and spoke to a really friendly woman with encylopedic knowledge of walking_boots .
0	her enthusiasm and expertise really impressed me and her advice was spot_on .
0	i literally cannot_fault webtogs , their website looks great , their service is second to none and their after sales process for requesting product and service reviews are slick and professional .
0	and the boots i bought were less_than half the price i would have had to pay at home in denmark .
0	if only all webshops were more like webtogs !
0	i have used double0 on various occasions and will always look on here whenever i am in a situation where i cannot obtain tickets anywhere_else !
0	every time i have wanted to go to the 00 to see a concert double0 always come to my rescue .
0	yes you may pay more but you are guaranteed to get good seats and the tickets everyone else wants .
0	i would always recommend them to anyone , you pay for what you get .
0	thank_you double0 and i am looking_forward to going to see_beyonce very soon ...

0	i have been taunton zizzi for many_times .
0	everytime is so happy with everything , ie , food , service , environment , cleanliness .... all .
0	000_% recommended .
0	that was my experience during half_term at taunton asda .
0	a young_girl asked for my id when i bought 0 bottles of lager .
0	i showed her , she asked for the id for my children .
0	i told her asda selling the lager to me not the children .
0	she insisted if no id of the children to prove they are over 00 .
0	then i cannot buy any lager .
0	i am 00 , restaurant licensee .
0	so i asked for her id to complain her poor knowledge .

0	she is fran .
0	i told her how can she check people '_s id but she did not have her own .
0	disguisting experience .
0	the manager came to sort_out and said she had to back up her staff ??
0	what is the system ?
0	disguisting service , very slow , very rude .
0	paid the item on 0 / 0 , 0_days_later asked for more postage , paid them , no response no delivery until 00 / 0 , received the perfect box , but when opened , all solutions are falled aparts , complained to the customer service , blamed to the courier broke them .
0	ridiculous .
0	operator julie snell was so rude at email , said would delete my details at their data base .
0	i never had that poor horrible service in my life .
0	they sells cheap but the service is so cheap too .
0	will not go back at all .
0	we are the managing agent who looks after the property on behalf of the landlord who is based in abu_dhabi .
0	in november of last_year there was a change of tenant .
0	the previous tenant moved out and the new_tenant moved in the day after .
0	there was no electricity usage in between tenants .
0	since november we have been receiving bills and debt_collection letters for £_000 at our office address but addressed to the landlord .
0	we have emailed notification of change of tenancy numerous_times , sent letters and made phone_calls .
0	first_utility refuse to speak to us as we are not named on the account ( despite our name being on the letters and bills ) but they have advised us rather_than the account being put into the new tenants name it has_been put into the landlords even_though there was no usage over the 00_hours it was vacant .
0	they now want the landlord to call them directly ( i '_m_sure that is possible when he '_s based in uae ?!!!!)
0	today i have been on hold for 00_minutes .
0	will to live is disappearing very quickly .
0	we have no_problems with change of tenancy when the big 0 are the providers but endless problems when it comes to first_utility

0	everything went smooth !
0	i really appreciated this site for it '_s ease of use and easy to follow design .
0	i had a hard time on similar_sites , finding the dates i needed to book , but hostelbookers . com only showed me the ones available for my dates !
0	i '_m a fastidious researcher and i went to multiple sites , including to the hostel sites themselves for prices and hostelbookers . com matched the lowest_price every time .
0	next time i need to book a hostel , i can save myself some time without sweating by going straight to hostelbookers . com , sans the research !
0	i really appreciate that .
0	thanks !
0	i have used parcel0go . com for a while now and they have always been great .

0	two_days_later , money in account .
0	quick , efficient , good value .
0	would highly_recommend .
0	quick delivery , great boots .
0	after buying ready washed salad and finding a live caterpillar in the salad i immediately emailed sainsburys to notify them .
0	i took them several days before i got a reply asking for an account number .
0	the only account i have with them is a nectar_card , i sent this and then they told me this is not what they wanted .
0	they wanted an order number .
0	two_weeks this was after my initial_contact .
0	as they were no help i took the salad into the store to deal with it .
0	the staff were mortified that there was a big and didn_'_t want to know .
0	they told me to ring the number on the back .
0	so i finally rang in , told them i was not happy with the customer service , the delays and the fact that their ready washed and ready to eat salad is coming with bugs !!!
0	she told me out of a " good will gesture " they would put £ 0 pounds onto my card .
0	no apology , no recognition of the absolute hassle or the fact their food is dirty and not washed properly .
0	she said if i wanted to i could bring it in for investigation but they usually don_'_t do anything about salad .
0	useless and annoyed !
0	we purchased a billabong winter wetsuit for my nephew , needed quick delivery for a wakeboarding comp he was competing in , the wesuit outlet provided second to none customer service , they were extremely_helpful and we got the wetsuit delivered the next_day .
0	my nephew was bouncing round the house he was so happy .
0	would recommend them to anyone , they have a great variety of products at very reasonable_prices .
0	we are very happy customers !
0	thanx
0	really easy , not the best price but the most trustworthy and really clear_instructions .
0	hostelbookers is an amazing site where you simply type in a destination and a list of hostels in that area pop - up by price , rating , location , etc !
0	it '_s so easy and saves a lot of time .
0	i highly_reccommend this if your looking for inexpensive places to rest your head !
0	i have ordered a game from them and they just send it a fake game by using fake plastic shrink_wrap . i was so upset for that .. unfortunately i havent chosen different shipping address , otherwise i was going send someone fake gift .
0	i ordered 0 of the same electronic item and they just cancelled my order just because i ordered two .
0	i had to wait 0week for reimbursement to be able to order them again from somewhere_else .
0	and their customer service manager is very rude , i don_'_t know how she became customer_services manager but when i wanted to speak to her supervisor , she told me that she is actually a manager and i was really surprised .
0	it might be the cheapest broadband_provider in the uk but certainly not the best .
0	the internet speed is not great , the tv_channels not fantastic but i was able to live with that .
0	the worse and unbearable thing is the customer_services ... saying that it is non_existent would be a compliment .
0	they are not only completely_useless and but also probably paid to annoy you .
0	talktalk could get_rid of them and replace them with machines , the end_result would be the same .
0	they don_'_t understand your request at all , don_'_t even care , and just repeat again and again talktalk policy .
0	helping you is not on their job description .
0	even now that i '_ve cancelled my account with them 0_months_ago , i still have issue with the refund they owe me .
0	talktalk is not a reliable company .
0	the whole_process was very easy from_start to finish .
0	sign up was easy and you just had to print_off the postage_label and post it yourself .
0	when i was delayed posting it they emailed to check everything was ok and they held the price for 0_weeks .
0	i have ordered 0 times from this website and i would recommend it to anyone .
0	the price is great and the quality of the product is excellent .
0	received all products within a couple of days of placing my order , well_packaged and good value for money .
0	thanks , will definitely buy again !
0	products & packaging very good no troubles !!!
0	defo recommend .
0	pricing of products very reasonable and great quality especially when buying in bulk .
0	delievery - no_complaints with the delivery company arrived in good time and no damage
0	came the very next_day !!
0	very good condition will make a wonderful christmas_present defiantly reccomed this company
0	i purchased an item on the 0rd of july was told delivery 0 working_days , no product arrived , contacted groupon and was lied to 0 times that my order was with royal_mail , im still_waiting after 0_weeks for my product .
0	i contacted groupon and was told i have to wait 00 working_days for my item to be re - issued even_though the merchant was willing to do it straight_away if groupon gives the authorization .
0	groupon refused and i asked for a refund and was told i had to wait the 00 working_days first for the re - issue before they can refund my money even_though i don_'_t want the product anymore .
0	they have the worst customer service and even their manager gareth is the most useless and very unhelpful , if you don_'_t want to come off the phone crying don_'_t bother buying from them because they would frustrate you .
0	excellent service
0	a real_life_saver when it comes to purchasing books for university .
0	i love the free_postage and packaging offers and delivery is always prompt .
0	would recommend to anyone .
0	i have ordered a few things from this company now and would recommend it to anyone .
0	the products are very good value for money but do not lack in quality .
0	the free_postage and packaging is excellent , items arrive within a week and are always well_wrapped ( especially important since the parcels are often containing glass ).
0	do not_hesitate to order from this company , i am always satisfied with the service and prices .
0	00 / 00 .
0	i recently_purchased a mattress from this company that i had meticulously researched .
0	i ordered it online without a problem and the money was taken out of my account quickly .
0	the next_day i received a phone_call from mattressnextday telling_me that the mattress i had ordered was now out of stock ( even_though it did not say this on the website ).
0	i was offered an_alternative and was told on the phone that the mattress i would be receiving instead was very similar / almost the same as the one i had originally ordered .
0	i mentioned exchanging on the phone and she said " it wouldn_'_t be a problem " but failed to mention the £_00 charge .
0	the day after that , the alternative mattress arrived .
0	it was roughly packaged and covered in mud and dirt .
0	i could tell instantly that it was a terrible mattress and phoned the customer service number .
0	the lady i spoke to on the phone was rude , unhelpful and unsympathetic .
0	she didn_'_t apologise at all and then told me that if i wanted a refund i would need to pay £_00 .
0	i argued that it wasn_'_t the mattress i originally ordered , that the lady didn_'_t mention the charge and that i had been mislead by her ( i was told it was similar ) but it did not matter .
0	i am now paying fifty_pounds to have this mattress taken_away , i would unquestionably not recommend this company to anyone .
0	take_note : no paper_work comes with the mattresses that they deliver .
0	appalling .
0	simply appalling .
0	camerakings is very quick in communication .
0	most of the times you can expect your e_- mail or facebook post answered within a few hours .
0	also , they always do as they promise .
0	i had two problems with a single order .
0	the first was that dutch customs charged me with taxes which i had to pay in cash to dhl .
0	camerkings refunded this within the hour !
0	the second problem was a faulty baseplate on the gini rigs advanced extreme 00 .
0	again , answered within the hour with the promise to immediately send me a replacement .
0	i '_m very pleased with the service of camerkings .
0	all companies should be like this .
0	hostelbookers beats out hostelworld for sure !
0	as a low - budget many - month traveler , avoiding an extra fee makes a big_difference in the long run .
0	you can also log in and keep registration details , which makes booking a place much_easier - it is a pain to have to re enter all details on hostelworld when i am booking a new place every week !
0	the details on locations gives you all the info you need in order to book , and the site loads fast on slow connections , which is very useful when wifi is slow while traveling !
0	it also lets you select more lodging options than just hostels and sometimes these have special rates which beat out a hostel .
0	i '_ll take a private_room for the same price as a hostel dorm any day !
0	!
0	i don_'_t know how this company is still in business .
0	the customer service is non - existent .
0	we ordered a painting for my parents wedding_anniversary and use interparcel as the courier it arrived to us 0_days day with no explanation or apology we opened the packaging to find the frame and glass smashed .
0	the answer we received was that its no there problem well im_sorry but if i am putting my faith in your company to complete a simple task as to delivery my parcel to me in one piece so of us quite clearly can not do their job properly .

0	i wish i had read the reviews of this company it is not the first time we had have dealings with this company but can_assure you it will be the last and would like to warn every_single person looking to use this company in future to read all these negative_reviews and stay away .
0	we received part payment of our delivery charge because it was not on time put wash there hands to anything_else .
0	all correspondence i have had with this company will be being sent to trading_standards and also watchdog and would suggest everyone else do the same .
0	its about time companies like these get what they deserve .
0	this company and there dodgy third_party companies have cost me a further £_000 in repair costs not to mention £_000 on a new painting for my parents wedding_anniversary .

0	didnt_recieve items on day i was expecting was just sat in depot for few_days ( weather not an excuse ) also did not get any information about products arriving late or when i will be recieving the rest of what i had ordered ??

0	i have always loved domino '_s pizza prob my favourite food !
0	i downloaded the app a few_months_ago but have never used it so thought i would for the first time wednesday_night .
0	i can not complain the pizza ( which was an half and half ) came exactly as requested but i just loved the extra bonus of the app saying at what point the pizza was at i . e baking or quality control .
0	very rare i have ever had complaint with dominos but when i do they are always resolved straight_away .
0	kate
0	came when expected as had easter inbetween .
0	the website was easy to use without forcing extra products .
0	excellent quality came individually boxed for protection .
0	the free presents were not bad either !
0	got my keys within a few_minutes after payment .
0	they have good prices too , would recommend !
0	i ordered three small canvas '_s and they arrived within a week !!
0	all the way from germany to the uk !
0	they were packaged really well and the quality is brilliant !

0	easy to use site and very fast delivery
0	they were very polite and helpful , called me within a few_minutes of my request and didnt take up too much time .
0	i have already_recomended a friend .

0	tyres_fitted the following_day .
0	i ordered a game from simply_games that cost less_than the other big companies i was thinking of ordering with .
0	the service was outstanding - the game arrived quickly and in perfect_condition .
0	i would recommend this company to anyone .
0	thank_you .
0	hostelworld is a great website to use when comparing hostels , prices , reviews plus they have an interesting blog and spend a lot of time on all social_media .
0	i just don_'_t understand_why they keep their ( pretty high ) booking_fees !
0	it can become very expensive when booking a lot of places , and especially when you ' re booking one night '_s accommodation that '_s possibly only costing you 00_euros , it costs you 00_% again just for the privilege of booking with them .
0	there are other_websites that are just as good that don_'_t charge anything , like europe '_s famous hostels and hostelbookers .
0	i '_ve now stayed in 00 of their hostels throughout europe and am yet to be disappointed .
0	they are independent hostels so you don_'_t feel like you ' re in a hostel factory like i '_ve felt before in some of the big hostels - in , pay , sleep , out ......
0	whenever there '_s a europe '_s famous hostel in the city i '_m going it '_s an easy choice for me , i just wish there was one everywhere !
0	their website is easy to book on and they don_'_t take any booking_fee which is a bonus compared to hostelworld , whose charges are pretty high .
0	000_% recommended !
0	so pleased that i had lasik done .
0	just wish i '_d had it sooner !
0	the process was professional from_start to finish with friendly helpful staff and in a nice environment .
0	mr_morris treated me at optegra in guildford , and i would recommend both him and richard the optometrist .
0	i always order clothes from boohoo and they always come really quickly which is amazing .
0	and they ae good quality and true to soze .
0	i will order from boohoo for forever !
0	thanks guys x
0	i was like i have a problem and bang in comes samantha not only did she solve my problem but she is now my new bestfriend !
0	great service and i couldn_'_t think of a better way to spend my thursday_night !
0	i had to change my ticket due to an_emergency .
0	i was told that i could not change the ticket and i had to cancel it with no refund .
0	i lost out on 000 plus dollars .
0	most airlines have a cancellation_fee or a change ticket fee .
0	i am disappointed , because i paid them for nothing .
0	i am a paying customer and the least i can get for my money is some help or some of my money back .
0	ebookers has lost a customer and i will be sure to let my friends know , that when life happens and things change ebookers dose not compromise .
0	please stay clear !
0	where do i begin , bad coverage when i was told it was good , i had a 00 day sim which i only wanted for 00 days but you have to give 00 days notice so as soon as i got it i rang 000 to cancel now this is a call_centre in india they are very hard to understand it took 00_mins to cancel and get a pac_code during these 00_mins i was told i would have to pay for 0_months which i said i wasn_'_t paying as its a 00 day contract and i was giving 00 days notice i will pay for that then i was told that i would get a bad credit_rating and enforcement officers would come and collect the money after this i agreed to pay so i could get my pac_code and cancel then i got put through to cancelations who then tried to sell me another contract i had to say i just want to cancel about 00 times before they actually did it awful company
0	great company they give you and hour_slot on the morning of delivery and they turned_up 00_mins into the hour_slot great service need more delivery companys like this !
0	brilliant website found it super easy to find the exact sunglasses both me and my hubby were after .
0	great service and speedy delivery .
0	highly_recommend .
0	i had been looking for a copy of this book for a long time .
0	i had seen several copies at silly prices .
0	this book arrived in good time was in good condition and was a reasonable_price .
0	can '_t fault outdoorkit , their delivery service was brilliant !
0	will_definately use them again without a doubt .
0	another reason_why i bought from this company was because of their accomodating returns_policy .
0	i highly_recommend this company !
0	the best stay you can have for money paid !!
0	!
0	the service is speedy , and it '_s great value for money - nice and discreet too .
0	i wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else .
0	very fast delivery , happy with the service
0	fantastic service , saved us a lot of money on the sale of our property .
0	currently using your conveyancing services for the house we ' re purchasing and very impressed so far !
0	speedy pick_up - car was perfect for what we required ... 0 adults and three children so we chose a citroen picasso c0 .
0	very helpful staff at the collection centre - great service all_round
0	i purchased sunglasses that weren_'_t quite right for my face , despite trying them on in a store in australia .
0	pretavoir refunded my money in full as soon as they received the package - no_hassles .
0	this kind of customer service is unheard of in australia and i have recommended pretavoir to a number of friends and colleagues for its good prices and exceptional service .
0	great company who saved my bacon on mothers_day after a disaster with a less reputable service !
0	very easy to use , lovely choice and free delivery to my mothers ( fairly out of the way , rural ) address .
0	thank_you interflora for cheering my mum up after her disappointment yesterday and saving me from being dis - owned :) from now on i '_ll be sticking to what i know !
0	having been with vodafone since the beginning of time practically , when my contract was due to end i decided to shop around some other deals .
0	couldn_'_t find anything that bettered my current tarrif so contacted vodafone to see what they offered .
0	customer_services were really friendly and helpful and i came away with a brand_spanking new smartphone , at no extra_cost and on the same tariff with a few extras thrown in !
0	i explained that i worked shifts and they arranged a time to deliver which suited .
0	i even got a text from them on the day letting_me know the exact time of delivery , saving me from hanging_around all day waiting .
0	great service and i '_m very happy with my lovely new phone !
0	three emails sent regarding my order for mothers_day flowers which were supposed to be delivered today and were not .
0	i have tried all day to access iflorists " live support " which untill half past nine tonight was set to " away ".
0	when i was finally able to connect i was informed by " jack " that due to the mothers_day rush , iflorist were unable to find a florist to deliver on time .
0	despite the order being placed on 00st_march , nobody could be bothered to get in touch and let_me know this in order that i could make alternative_arrangements .
0	when i asked why no one had been in touch , i was then informed that due to the limited amount of florists in the area the delivery would not be dispatched untill tuesday .
0	considering the money has already been taken from my account i think this is completely_unacceptable .
0	i wish i had read all the terrible reviews this site has had before i placed my order but i honestly didn_'_t expect such shoddy service , i think it '_s absolutely_disgusting that they are taking people '_s money and basically causing undue disappointment and distress to people who rely_on services like this to deliver flowers on special occassions .
0	i have been offered a discount_voucher for £_00 my next order , well i can tell you with absolute certainty that there will never be a next order from me or anyone i know .
0	i wouldn_'_t use iflorist again if they were paying me !
0	i have been told that " jack " will arrange a full_refund , which will be in my account within 0 - 0 working_days .
0	i will be contacting my bank first thing in the morning to ensure that the money has_been refunded and i will be following this up and taking it further if need be .
0	in the meantime , i will now have to explain to a rather disappointed mum what has happened and hope that a much more reliable and trustworthy interflora can deliver something which will make up for iflorists terrible service .
0	in future i '_ll be reading_reviews before i purchase anything , but in the meantime i would urge_anyone to stick to trusted sites and avoid this mob like the plague !
0	ordered miniature jagermeisters for wedding_favours , contacted company and they price matched another company .

0	very fast international_shipping .
0	no_complaints will order again for sure .
0	before i ordered from beautybay . com i looked at reviews on the net and was quite surprised to see loads of bad ones .
0	but i decided to take a risk anyway . i live in sweden .
0	my order has arrived within 0working_days or so .
0	i knew i will not have any_problems with beautybay . com . thank_you very much for my nice first experience with you :_d
0	excellent priced items .
0	excellent , fast customer service !
0	will definitely buy from sh !
0	again in the future !
0	great products at great prices .
0	delivery is prompt too .
0	will definitely continue to shop_here .
0	good value for money .
0	would definitely use them again .
0	ordered my ghds from them and was happy with the service until yodel tried to deliver my product .
0	as soon as i got the first card through the door i phoned the delivery person as instructed on the card and asked when they would be re - delivered .
0	i said that i would be available saturday_morning ( the next_day ) before 00 as i was away for the weekend or after 0 in the week ( it also stated on the card that they deliver between 0 . 00 and 0pm ).
0	i also said they could leave it with a neighbour .
0	the next card i got through the door stated that they tried to deliver it at 00 and that they couldn_'_t leave it with a neighbour , then again at lunch times during the week .
0	after the last card i contacted yodel to explain what had happened and they said i could pick it up from the local_depot .
0	no where in the email or on their website did it give the address of the local_depot or a date to collect by .
0	so i went down on a saturday_morning at my earliest convenience to collect package and was surprised to find they had sent it back to sender within a week .
0	i then contacted body care 0000 to rearrange delivery and was again surprised to find they had refunded me less 00_% for costs for delivery .
0	as it states on their website that you have two_weeks to collect ( if delivered by royal_mail ).
0	i then inquired_about what had happened and why i was being charged when i didn_'_t feel i was at fault and i got some really patronising emails off someone called linda @ bodycare0000 .
0	i then asked for a number and a manager to contact and they never got back to me .
0	i am out of pocket and have no product .
0	the delivery was really quick and the products have been excellent and as_described .
0	fab - i would use again !
0	i would recommend beautybay again , they were really fast in delivery and the product is just what i expected .
0	this company is diabolical and i have never been involved with such scam_artists .
0	yes there are some good reviews on this site for pyb , however they are from people who just say " cheap and quick to set_up " - they haven_'_t even tried claiming from pyb .
0	my ipad was stolen and they are refusing to pay out .
0	avoid at all costs .
0	thanks for the dosh !
0	very quick payment !
0	from the very first phone_call to the final delivery i received excellent customer_services .
0	the communication level was high and helpful and the product when it was delivered was exactly as i hoped , and was also delivered ahead of schedule too even_though it was a large order .
0	also , i work using a purchase order system as i work for a local_council and this was no problem for adband who were able to invoice me and release the product even_though i was unable to pay immediately .
0	thank_you very much .
0	i have no_hesitation in recommending adband to anyone and would happily use them again in the future !
0	ordered two_pairs of shoes from boohoo totaling almost £_00 .
0	i was charged for both and only received one .
0	i have tried to contact boohoo using all methods ( inc twitter and facebook ) and had no response .
0	their customer service is truly_awful .
0	they have no contact number and despite responding to most_recent messages on twitter , they ignored mine from hours ago .
0	very selective about who the help obviously .
0	disgusting .
0	if i could give no stars , i would have .
0	i will never be using boohoo again .
0	they do not care about their customers at all .
0	avoid at all costs .. you can get the same items elsewhere and actually receive them !
0	!
0	i don_'_t know what is better , the extensive_range of products buyhair . co . uk offer or their amazing customer service !?
0	my prostyles hair came super quick and buyhair will not be_beaten on price !
0	so affordable , quick delivery ( with very reasonable postage and packaging ) and a huge_range of products .
0	i will always return to buyhair .

0	i ordered 00 drawing mannequins from this website , i '_d never_heard of it before so didn_'_t know what to expect but the low price and great delivery promises caught my eye .
0	got quite a few emails and texts to inform_me of delivery days and times which was nice so i could make_sure someone was in .
0	then a text to inform_me my ordered was left with my neighbour , and a picture of their gate , the little things just show the quality of the service .
0	i wiped out the stock with this ordered so received 0 out of the 00 .
0	i emailed to ask when the remaining 0 would be with me , i had an_email back within the hour telling_me it would be only a few_days and apologised for the unconvinced .
0	very impressed with the quality of the product and the service .
0	thank_you so much !
0	i thought i '_d have to wait a couple of days for the keys to come through but they were there the morning after i '_d ordered them online the previous afternoon .
0	i have spent most of my morning telling any one who will listen what an efficient delivery service river_island are running .
0	so , imagine my surprise when i then hear from my boyfriend who has taken time of work to await the arrival of my parcel that it has not been delivered .
0	the first thing i did was check river_islands seemingly uber efficient tracking website which told me that my parcel had not been delivered as the driver could not find my address .
0	the only options i was given to proceed via the tracking service was to choose another day or deliver my parcel to a neighbour .
0	the nature of my problem meant that both of these options were invalid so i set about negotiating the labyrinth that is , fist dpd ( the couriers ), and then river_islands own customer service lines .
0	both of which , surprise_surprise , are dreadful .
0	dpds line ( the courier service used by river_island ) has 0 / 0 options which lead to an_automated_message before cutting the caller off .
0	the remaining option " 0 " if anyone_else is having this problem finally got me through to a genuine human_being : mark , who , judging_by the sound of his voice , really could not be arsed giving any customer service via his customer service line .
0	i was told by the lovely mark that dpd would be unable to change the address on my parcel and that i should contact river_islands own customer service line .
0	i did this , not easily i might_add , and found myself , after another wonderfully frustrating automated_voice parade , on the phone to an employee named mike who sounded_like he cared_about as much as mark had before him .
0	mike told me , in pure monotone , that river_island were unable to change the address on a package and nor could i cancel my purchase .
0	the reason i was given for being unable to change the address was that the website triple checks the address with the customer thrice before purchase is completed on the website .
0	i then asked the cheerful chap what river_island therefore suggested i do next and was told to call back dpd .
0	now , let_me just stop there for a moment , at this point neither company will allow me to change my address or take_responsibility for my parcel nor am i allowed to return the goods and am unable to change the date or deliver to a neighbour because the courier cannot find the address which i cannot change .
0	does any one else see how illogical this whole_thing is ?
0	well , luckily for me matthew at dpd did who quickly went above and beyond to help me rectify my , admittedly , own mistake with the original address .
0	however , even matthew could not save the day entirely as i will no_longer be shopping at river_island .
0	i had spent over_£_000 on this purchase alone and no one i spoke with seemed the slightest bit inclined to help me until i explained the situation in full to matthew at dpd .
0	moral of the story ?
0	river_island bad , dpd ( their courier service ) bad , matthew of dpd ...
0	the silver_lining .
0	i have spent most of my morning telling any one who will listen what an efficient delivery service river_island are running .
0	so , imagine my surprise when i then hear from my boyfriend who has taken time of work to await the arrival of my parcel that it has not been delivered .
0	the first thing i did was check river_islands seemingly uber efficient tracking website which told me that my parcel had not been delivered as the driver could not find my address .
0	the only options i was given to proceed via the tracking service was to choose another day or deliver my parcel to a neighbour .
0	the nature of my problem meant that both of these options were invalid so i set about negotiating the labyrinth that is , fist dpd ( the couriers ), and then river_islands own customer service lines .
0	both of which , surprise_surprise , are dreadful .
0	dpds line ( the courier service used by river_island ) has 0 / 0 options which lead to an_automated_message before cutting the caller off .

0	we bought my engagement_ring a week_ago from diamond_dealer direct ...
0	i didn_'_t really know what i wanted and spent the morning wandering_around the jewellery_quarter feeling a bit overwhelmed_by the huge choice !
0	christina was very helpful !
0	she went through loads of different type stones , shapes and bands until we '_d narrowed it down to my favourite ring .
0	she was very helpful , friendly and down to earth - felt like i '_d brought a friend shopping with me !
0	also , the price compared to similar rings i '_d seen across the quarter was extremely competitive .
0	i '_d recommend to anyone !
0	great prices , fast delivery , good quality products and great customer service .
0	fast returns refunds too .
0	00 / 00
0	very pleased with designer paint .
0	they have the best range of paints and the service is great .
0	lots of samples available although some are ridiculously_expensive for the size pot you get ( fired_earth !!!)

0	i had a lot of email contact with aggressive_health before i purchased my first vegan protein_powder .
0	the advice given was great and mike was extremely patient with my never ending questions and was able to answer all of them .
0	this company is ran by a fitness expert which made me feel so much_better when asking advice as i knew i was going to be recommended the right products rather_than being recommended the most expensive or supplement that makes them the most money like other faceless supplement companies !
0	it was a pleasure_dealing_with aggressive_health and i will definitely be use them again .
0	fast delivery , quality products , expert_advice .
0	highly_recommended !

0	great communication and very helpful staff thank - you for all your help !

0	my husband bought me roses for our first valentines_day together .
0	he recieved an_email on wednesday 00th at 00 . 00pm to say they wouldnt be delivered until 00th !!!!!
0	after waiting until_0pm today - still no sign so my husband called up and apparently they would be there before 0pm !
0	they have just turned_up now and and they are a total state .
0	every flower is pretty_much dead .
0	really disappointed .
0	very easy to use service .
0	detailed emails explaining what is happening and when the money will be transferred .
0	would definitely recommend to friends and family .
0	i ordered last_minute tickets to backstreet boy for this coming friday .
0	ordered the tickets at a discounted_price on sunday and they arrived today .
0	a very reliable company to use , even_though i had my doubts at first , as i '_d not heard of them before .
0	much_better_than viagogo and similar_sites , the price you see is the price you pay .
0	would definitely use them again
0	i would definitely recommend anyone to do courses with e_- careers .
0	they make is hassle_free and there is always support there when you need help .
0	this is the first time i used e_- careers , but definitely won_'_t be my last .
0	animed is a great website with a wide_range of products at cheap , affordable_prices .
0	the ordering process is quick and simple and products arrive quickly and in great packaging .
0	i have reccomended animed to all of my friends and family , as vets and supermarkets charge up to 0 times the prices on animed .
0	thank_you for creating such a brilliant website !
0	purchased an acre of moon off here from moon estates , waited 00 days for it to arrive , when it did the certificate had the wrong name on it .
0	when i contacted moon estates they told me it was a £ 0 charge to change the name and that they had had a great number of calls as wowcher had made mistake with order details .
0	i do not see why i should have to pay this amount to change the name .
0	have emailed several_times over a week_ago and heard_nothing back at all .
0	disgusted
0	easy transaction cash paid straight_away - thanks
0	i always use these_guys when looking to buy myself a new dvd .
0	such good prices generally half the price of anywhere on the highstreet , and usually delivered within a 0_days or so .
0	thanks for all the great service i have received in the past , i will definitely continue to use you for the foreseeable_future !
0	we placed our order on camerabox . co . uk , the reason being ; they came out on top of the best deals we could find on all the price comparison_sites .
0	we placed our order on friday 0th with express delivery as the method of postage .
0	and we received it at 0 : 00 this morning .
0	in my opinion , that is extremely quick service .
0	to be honest we couldn_'_t quite believe our eyes !
0	now i wouldn_'_t think_twice when looking to purchase any further photographic_equipment .
0	just outstanding service , i can '_t give them enough credit .
0	keep_up the good work guys !
0	i heard about identity through a friend nearly 0 years_ago now , and what a fantastic find it was !
0	for an_independent , family run business , the vast_range of products they stock is remarkable , definitely spoilt for choice !

0	we just picked_up our brand_new kia sportage 0 today from this kia dealer .
0	we are from perth scotland and had looked around dealers here and met our fair share of pushey dealers with very high prices .
0	after looking on the net we came_across a fantastic deal from chorley_group thinking it was maybe to good to be true we gave them a call and was put through to sales and spoke to russell .
0	much to our delight the deal was there and ours from the taken which we snapped up .
0	after going over everything with russell and getting the car ordered and going to pick it up russell kept us well informed if i needed to know anything a quick email sent off was answered in great time .
0	nothing was to much hassle we were even picked_up from the train_station to go and collect our car today .
0	so to sum up our experience if you want to purchase a top_class vehicle with 0st_class customer_care and great value for money , deal with chorley_group .
0	even if you don_'_t live in blackpool they are definitely worth traveling to .
0	russell made you feel at ease he took care of everything .
0	i will definitely be looking to do_business with him for our next car , best sales_man we have ever had the pleasure of doing_business with .
0	have had countless orders from this company however my last 0 orders have been terrible .
0	items arriving damaged , no tags , heel broken on a pair of boots and a strap on a bag snapped .
0	sizes changed order a 00 it '_s like an 00 order a 00 it '_s like a 0 .
0	complained to head_office as ordered a cardigan size 00 .
0	when it came was stuffed in a bag , hole in shoulder , no tags to say was new .
0	looked inside had a george asda tag size 0 .
0	contacted company took photo of item they denied sending it said they didn_'_t sell asda clothing even_though cardigan was identical to the one on the site which i screen_shot and sent with the picture of the cardigan .
0	they refused to let_me return it .
0	person_who emailed me was very rude .
0	my daughter had her 0th_birthday_party here doing pottery painting .

0	we have also bought various pairs of shoes and trainers from here and again the staff have been friendly and my children have also had a good choice of shoes to choose from .
0	thank_you very much
0	i placed an order late one evening and received a phone_call from a member of the team on the following_morning checking with me because the order had gone_through twice .
0	i spoke to two ladies who were lovely and i did only want to order the items once which saved me the hassle of receiving them and then having to return the items .
0	i have already_recommended this website to other people as i was extremely pleased with the whole_process !
0	many_thanks
0	i have just finished sage course , left it for last_minute though but once i sat down to get on with it i found it really easy to follow , even without much accounts experience .
0	could do with simple explanation of basic computer stuff - for example - click ok to exit , rather then move your cursor to the bottom right corner of the screen and left click on ok button once , except this all great and very pleased .

0	i love just eat , its so easy to use and ive never had problems using the site on my iphone or computer .
0	great choice of food and restaurants too !
0	no_complaints whatsoever !
0	i love just eat , can order from both my iphone and computer and its so easy to use with a variety of foods to choose from .
0	had no_problems with the site whatsoever .
0	my husband ordered me flowers for valentine '_s day , and it was agreed upon ordering them that they would be delivered before 0pm as we were leaving for a week long trip at 0pm ( the plan was to take the flowers with us so that i could enjoy them whilst i was away ).
0	between 0 and 0pm my husband was getting more and more concerned that the flowers hadn_'_t showed up , so he kept ringing eflorist but could never get through on the phone ( he was on hold the entire time ).
0	we waited_until 0 . 00pm but couldn_'_t hold on any longer as we had a 0 hour car journey ahead of us and a 00 month_old who needed to be put to sleep in the car .
0	eventually our flowers must have turned_up as they were delivered to our neighbours .
0	after failing to get through to eflorist on the phone , my husband sent an_email complaint to them but no one ever replied .
0	the next_day he continually rang eflorist but could never get through when selecting the option that he was calling about an " existing order ".
0	eventually he got through when he selected the option to " place a new order ", and was told he was not eligible for a refund despite explaining our circumstances in detail .
0	we never even got to see the flowers as we were away for a week , and they had died by the time we got home .
0	we both wrongly assumed that eflorist would be apologetic and give us a full_refund but as they refused we intend to spread the word to our friends , family and beyond that they shouldn_'_t use eflorist .
0	i was reading the reviews whilst waiting for my tesco '_s shopping to be delivered .
0	doesn_'_t feel you with confidence as there are a lot of negative_reviews but i was pleasantly_surprised !
0	anyway , i had a delivery for between 0pm - 00pm .
0	they arrived at 0 . 00pm .
0	friendly driver , he even apologised for the wait .
0	he advised that only one item was missing ( it was chocolate so quite upsetting lol !).
0	anyway , eggs were in the order and he checked them over before handing them to me .
0	very courteous and much_appreciated .
0	unpacked all the shopping and was happy that all the fresh items had at_least 0_days until expiry .
0	the only item that had a couple of days was some strawberries but in fairness , when you buy strawberries in the shop , they have a maximum of 0_days anyway .
0	thats it , all good , no_complaints ( they are probably saving my waistline not having the chocolate in stock !)
0	and i would use again .
0	i '_ve been using quidco for a few_years_now but have really started to use it more intensely recently .
0	well , what can i say ?
0	i always shop on a quidco friendly site .
0	its all worth it , from 00p to £_00 . 00 , everything adds_up .
0	most of the purchases track , but its easy to raise a claim if they don_'_t .
0	i pay the £ 0 a year ( although you can opt for the free membership ) as it is nice to be able to receive my cashback quicker .
0	plus the live_chat option is really helpful and the staff are really quick to respond by email if you have a query .
0	i now kick_myself if i ever buy something online and don_'_t quidco it !!
0	in the last 0_months i have managed to track £_000 of cashback - 00_% of that has already been paid into my bank and the rest will probably come within the next couple of months .
0	easy money for doing nothing but clicking_through !
0	super_fast service , received within 00_hours of ordering .
0	brilliant !
0	i ordered a full bathroom for over 0k and am happy with the product and the quality .
0	we ordered
0	- left hand l shaped whirlpool shower bath with 0 jets .
0	it '_s wonderful but difficult to get around the screen to clean the bath .
0	- cube dual with quadrato head and ceiling arm .
0	very pretty
0	- quadra waterfall bath filler .
0	- quadra waterfall side lever basin mixer_tap .
0	everyone love this .
0	- prima soft_close toilet_seat .
0	does exactly_what it says on the tin !
0	my issue , and the reason for only giving three stars was with the lack of knowledge and near rudeness with the numerous sales_reps over the phone .
0	it was a more complaicated order as i was paying from overseas but they made no effort to try and find a solution .
0	in the end a wonderful sales agent , simon thomas from the wigan_branch provided a solution .
0	without him they would have lost the sale to a competitor .
0	following on from reviewing a company trustpilot contacted me saying my negative_review of said company was in breach of their guidelines .
0	i edited by review to bring it inline and it went live .
0	it was taken down again immediately and i was asked to provide evidence to my purchase .
0	i sent an invoice i had from the company and imagined i would see my review live again .
0	this is not the case .
0	i '_m now being questioned on what i purchased , as if that is relevant whether i bought a chair or a table !
0	the important point is that i have complied with every_single guideline and my review is still not visable .
0	i find this completely_unacceptable and certainly not unbiased as they should be .
0	this is the second time i have used this company and i will_continue to use them .
0	ordering online is easy and getting the tyres_fitted at a time and place convenient for myself is vital .
0	i would definitely recommend to other people .
0	from_start to finish i received constant_contact from them updating_me of everything and when i had placed the wrong delivery address they changed it quickly without hassle .
0	they also allowed me to track my item even_though i took_advantage of the free_postage available !
0	great company quick delivery too !!
0	would recommend to friends for sure !
0	i had some questions_regarding the layout of our_wedding_invites and found the company to be really helpful and provided some good advice .
0	we ordered a proof to check the final layout ourselves also and this was all sent speedily so the order could be placed , as an impatient bride to be this was greatly_appreciated !
0	would definately recommend !
0	contacted tyres on the drive & they were very friendly on the phone , i told them i live on a terraced street so the car would be on the road & they said this was no problem .
0	they gave a 0 hour time_slot & arrived just before .
0	chris & matt were very friendly & polite , and even_though i had ordered a new tyre , they told me that my tyre was in really good condition just had a tiny nail causing a slow_puncture .
0	they gave_me the option of having the new tyre or having it repaired for less_than half the price .
0	can '_t help but think many places would have taken the tyre , repaired it themselves & made the money on it , but instead they saved me £_00 .
0	excellent service & value for money & i would definitely recommend .
0	the most professional company i have dealt_with for a long time .
0	good customer service and very helpfull staff .
0	very have £_00 of my cash and won_'_t return it .
0	can '_t get any response from then .
0	spent £££ on their chargeable phone line trying to rectify their mistakes .
0	useless robots in a call_centre ( south_africa ?)
0	who say they will sort it out , then do nothing .
0	been in tears .
0	need my money back .
0	it '_s xmas !!!!
0	!
0	very impressed with mazuma .
0	very easy to arrange for the mobile to be sent off and i got paid the amount i was promised very quickly .
0	would highly_recommend .
0	being a full time ( 0am - 0pm ) worker , it is always hard to arrange time off for my service & mot every year and then trying to sort transport whilst the car is gone but this solves all my problems !
0	i didn_'_t even have to leave my office and received a call to confirm if i wanted them to do the recommended work or not ... fabulous service !
0	i was recommended to your company and i can see why , i would recommend to anyone ... 00 out of 00 !
0	i buy natracare sanitary products as i am unable to use normal ones due to allergies .
0	my local supermarkey has now stopped_selling them and i didn_'_t know what i was going to do until i found the natural woman website .
0	they have the full range of products and are the same price that i paid in the supermarket .
0	the postage was resonable and were delivered very quickly , they are lifesavers to me !
0	i ramdomly found this website and so glad i did .
0	have bought loads from it and so have a lot of my friends and family .
0	people can '_t_believe i only paid £ 0 for most of the things i '_ve got .
0	if something isn_'_t right , they refund / exchange really easily and have never had a problem with them at all !
0	recommend it to everyone !
0	!
0	i '_ve been shopping in divine_trash for years the staff are always friendly , helpfull , and full of advice their products are bang_on trend and very good value for money never disappointed x
0	excellent website , easy to navigate .

0	i have just recieved my valentines_day flowers which my boyfriend bought from them to be sent to me at work today ( valentines_day ) and i just needed to express how disgusted i am .
0	the flowers were delivered in a damaged box and when i opened them i was so dissapointed .
0	these flowers were dispatched on monday 00th_feb - are you suprised they are dead ?
0	there were not in water and had come loose in the box so are not looking their best .
0	the mojority of them are dry , black and curling !
0	they are so squashed and look like a 0 year_old hand_tied them .
0	i had to call my boyfriend and thank him , however he knew something was wrong and is equally as angry that he purchased from yourselves .
0	i understand they are an internet company with lots of orders but there will be so many unhappy ladies today if their flowers were sent out monday and arrived in this state aswell !
0	i am_furious !
0	hope to be getting a refund !
0	if you cant handle the busy day orders then dont take any more !
0	dead flowers are no use to anyone !
0	i wont even be able to enjoy them for one day .
0	really pleased to find the shoes i wanted at such a reasonable_price .
0	ordered my usual salomon size but they were too_big so sent them back for an exchange .
0	received an_email_confirmation of receipt of the returned goods and that the replacements had been dispatched .
0	that was yesterday and this morning the shoes were here .
0	amazing !
0	why aren_'_t all mail order companies this good ?
0	i will definitely be using outdoorkit again .
0	as with many of the people below i ordered a bean_bag via_groupon on 0th_november for a christmas_present and it '_s not arrived and i cannot get a response via_email or telephone - i '_ve tried several numbers .
0	i '_ve now written to bbc_watchdog and copied them this thread as well as writing to groupon about it .
0	will let you know what_happens .
0	used this company for the first time and i am pleased to say i will definitely use them again .
0	my goods arrived in very good time and i was delighted with the costs compared to purchasing these items fro the vet .
0	bought a coat and the wrong_size came .
0	tried several_times to call but no one ever picked_up .
0	sent numerous_emails and query forms to which i had a ' thank_you for your query ' reply but never received anything_else despite them saying they answer all emails within 0 working_days ???
0	total_waste of time !!!
0	!
0	lucky for me i paid on my credit_card so i am covered and they wont_be keeping my money !!
0	!
0	servicing_stop did a wonderful job and i would certainly recommend them to my friends .
0	they picked_up my car on time , done the mot and returned it in spotless condition .
0	they saved me lots of time and money .
0	i e_- mailed wowcher on their enquiries e_- mail address regarding a special_offer they advertised on september 0th , asking if the deal was suitable for a person in a wheelchair .
0	to this day , i still_haven_'_t heard from them and the deal is long gone .
0	looking at previous_reviews , it seems that the only way to get a response from wowcher is to leave poor feedback on a public_forum , so here goes .
0	the lack of respect in answering potential customer '_s queries is , quite_frankly , disgusting and , as such , i won_'_t be using them in the future , however good the deals are .
0	compared brands to multiple sites and there '_s nothing like this one !
0	only used once , but would certainly order from the company in future !
0	speedy dispatch / delivery & was kept_informed of progress .
0	the item was very competitively_priced & arrived as_described .
0	horrendous_experience !!
0	ordered my brother '_s xmas_present in nov , which the website advised was out of stock , but would be available in jan ..( as he already knew what he was getting he said was happy to wait ).
0	when checking my bank_statement in mid dec though i noticed a refund from very , rang them & they confirmed they had cancelled the order as they were not in fact getting the item in ( but didn_'_t have the courtesy to actually inform_me of this in the 0wks since ).. then it turned_out they hadn_'_t refunded the shipping ... so i spent probably the cost of this on phonecalls ( was cut_off twice while ' on hold ' after battling through the lengthy & inaccurate voice recognition menu system ).
0	it took 0 attempts for what passes as ' customer service ' to find my account , then 00_minutes on hold while they talked to a supervisor , before saying they couldn_'_t refund my card , but would have to send out a cheque for £ 0 . 00 ... gaaaaaaaaaaaaah .
0	shop with very at your_peril - only if you have the patience of a saint & don_'_t care about shocking service ....
0	this is a comprehensive travel policy that has the ability to cover you for whatever and wherever you are going at a great rate .
0	moreover , the customer service team are friendly , helpful and easy to get in touch with .
0	so far , so good ... now all i have to do is start travelling with the knowledge that everything that might happen can be sorted_out !
0	using hostel_bookers is so easy - they even give you directions to the place !
0	winning !!
0	it is really easy to see the best deals and where each place is in town !
0	sometimes i think the reviews are a bit_harsh on places , but it is super helpful to read about the positives and negatives of each place !
0	i will definitely keep using this site !
0	everything went_smoothly .
0	we got the good quotes on the first day , amongst them was the perfect one .
0	it was really a great help .
0	i recently bought the finger mouse fan club tee .
0	i loved that programme and think it is a fab idea to put video_clips on each page of the website - a real feel good factor .
0	the tee arrived really quickly and is fantastic quality , so soft and washes really well .
0	i want to get some more tees as christmas_gifts .
0	what a great way to bring back your childhood during the festive_season !!
0	thank_you so much .
0	i was a bit_unsure of using a site like this however it couldn_'_t have been easier .
0	i registered my phone and the free paid_envelope arrived within 0_days , i sent the phone and again within 0_days the money was in my account , overall the whole_transaction took approx 0 week super

0	love the payout options as well , i usually pay mine onto my clubcard and keep it for christmas .
0	would definitely recommend .
0	i had used mandmdirect a couple of times in the past but i happened to check my bank_account over christmas and they had taken money from my bank_account .
0	i hadn_'_t ordered anything in months .
0	i contacted them and they refunded it but said they couldn_'_t give an explanation - just not a good enough response for such a breech of trust !
0	we have worked with passion_digital for a number of years and never once have we experienced a problem .

0	highly_recommended !
0	no_problems , were interested in my feed_back
0	they stole our money .
0	we turned_up for our hen_do cocktail_making sessions at sway bar and were told release travel hadn_'_t paid for the session or dinner and that it would cost 000_pounds .
0	we paid release months before .
0	of course there was no one answering release travel " we '_ll be there should have any_problems " emergancy phone line .
0	the hen was distraught .
0	have since looked up their credit_history they have four ccjs out againest them , and even then they haven_'_t paid up .
0	they lied to the hen all the previous week saying everything was all good and ready .
0	getting the money back is like getting blood out of a stone .
0	we got ours back by going down and visiting them in person , when they said the cheque would be ready .
0	which they had said about 00 times before .
0	ordered loads of shoes from everything five_pounds .

0	we all know the impact of bulk sms marketing .
0	it is by far the best way to approach your target audience .
0	i was dealing_with a bulk messaging company earlier but i started having problems with them regarding their rates as well as timings .
0	i was being charged a lot more than i was told .
0	found voodoo sms as i was browsing .
0	its been a year i have been doing_business with them and as their name_suggests , they are magical !
0	due to their advice and reasonable ( not ascending every other day ) charges i am having a great time with them .
0	i have seen constant on - site improvement and hope to see more .
0	keeping in touch internationally from mobiles was never affordable unless i got to know about inclusive international calls .
0	i have used digital calling cards before and was enjoying cheap international calls but then i came_across iic i tried it because free sounds better_than cheap and to my surprise its totally free .
0	talking for free with my 00 inclusive minutes feels great .
0	now i can stay connected to my friends with free international calls from the uk .
0	making free calls from mobiles is amazing when it is truly free .
0	000 numbers has surprised me with their reliable follow me numbers services .
0	i had to call my customers but i wasn_'_t in the uk .
0	000 numbers proved to be very handy as i got to hide my private number .
0	they are cheap yet very reliable .
0	i must_say that the service is amazing .
0	i found it really easy and cheap to call my friends in scotland and australia .

0	i then sent my phones on the monday and by tuesday lunch_time the money was in my bank , exactly_what they said they would pay me , no questions , no_hassle !
0	very pleased and surprised at how easy it was !
0	where do i begin ?
0	always check your receipts !
0	on one of these shops , 0 / 0 of the products i ordered were unavailable , on other shops huge_amounts were unavailable .
0	regular promotion mistakes - always in tesco '_s favour , never customers .
0	overcharged something , 00_% of the time , i '_d say .

0	one of these being over an_hour later than the end time of the slot with no call or notification .
0	cheated on promotional points

0	i recently bought 0 season of friends and 0 season of lost on dvd from here - never again .
0	in each boxset , there was one disc which was for a different season of the same show .
0	one of my series 0 friends discs was actually for season 0 .
0	0 times is not a coincidence - it makes me think that it is done on purpose .
0	i would rather pay an extra few_pounds from a different shop , because at_least the discs will be correct .
0	ordered a personalized mug , which was delievered on time and great quality .
0	really pleased with my purchase and would highly_recommend !
0	tried to buy the same sunglasses from a different company as was so messed_around , so i tried blaze instead and i '_m so pleased i did .
0	i just received my sunglasses , ( arrived the next_day as promised ) they look a lot better_than the picture .
0	would definitely buy from this site again , and will be recommending to all my friends !!!!
0	very happy customer !!!

0	dear_sir / madam ,
0	my order had been confirmed and money taken out of my account in full . i was due my order between 0 - 0 pm on the 0th_may .
0	by 0 . 00 i phoned customer_services to be told she would ring the driver ( whils i was on hold ) to which there was no answer from driver .
0	she informed me she would keep trying the driver and get back too me ( which i heard_nothing back .!
0	) as it got to 0pm i was worried , our shopping was not going to arrive . we are on benefits , and therfore have no spare money what so ever .
0	i had no food it except bread and so had to sent my daughters 0 and 00 too bed with 0 slices of toast , in which i felt awful ( that was there tea ) . this was so upsetting , not having food which you have rightly paid for .
0	its now 0pm so i ring back . com , to be told the driver had now gone home ( i was told it was stange as there was no accident or breakdown recorded ) which would have been easier to accept then just not bothering . he then apparently arrived back in store a little later with our shopping .
0	i then asked to speak to a manager at which i was told he would give £_00 worth of e_- vouchers to take off this order we were due , as he had put the order through once again of his system between 0 - 00am the following_morning .
0	i was told to go back through my orders on . com and to apply my e_- vouchers so the balance outstanding would therefore be £_00 . 00 .
0	this i then did to no_avail as my bank_account was now empty as tesco . com had taken the money allready so thefore could not confirm order to reduce balance . as i stated i had no spare money !. i then phoned . com back ( which is also costing me .)
0	to be told that because my account was now empty this wouldnt be possible .
0	so now i am back too square0 .
0	as i will never shop with . com again after this disaster , i did not want the e_- vouchers taking off my next shop , i wanted the money off the shop that was due !
0	i was told the driver had said he knocked at our door and there was no answer , which is a lie as we firstly have a camera too prove he never came to the door and so do our neighbours .
0	( which is 000_% proof this member off staff is a liar ) my daughter husband and mother was in the house all day with myself .
0	we aggreed with sarah ( manager ) to go into store in blackpool as this is where our shopping is , to collect , and speak too mike norbury ( manager ). so i had too put my mother out to take us all the way down ther too sort it ( also costing in petrol !)
0	we arrived at the store at 00pm , after taking daughter too doctors .
0	we asked for mike norbury too which he came too see us .
0	i had too explain the whole situation once again to mr mike norbury . he kept telling us to just take our shopping and use the e_- vouchers off our next shop as there was nothing else he could do .
0	i had already told him we will never shop with them again so to refund me the money into bank , too which he said he couldnt do from store ?
0	i said as a good will gesture we should be given the shopping for nothing as all the hassle k , kids going without tea , petrol money , phone_call and the sheer stress off the stress and frustration in which he smirked !!
0	he said he made a phone_call too head_office and has refunded the shopping too our bank accound this he did by store after telling us this was not something he could do .
0	this i was told will take 0 - 0_days too show in bank .
0	( i just hope it arrives )...
0	this was then fine i said and made my way to husband where he and a member off teso staff were putting in the back of my mums car .
0	my husband then went too find my mum instore as she had got bored off sitting in car , as it was all taking ages ..
0	he came_across mr mike norbury talking with another member off staff clearly slagging us off for having our shopping for nothing .
0	he was going too approach mr mike norbury in store , but i adviced too come away and complain to head_office .
0	i then got home to unpack my shopping to be disapointed once again these are the reasons_why ?.
0	0 . coleslaw all over one of the bags ,
0	0 .
0	0 lettuces with yesterdays date on them , ( the date we orriginally ordered )
0	0 . missing cheese ,
0	0 . squashed bread ,
0	0 . steak that had so much fat through it i feel it was only fit for my dog ,
0	i am greatly disapointed and un neverd as to how this is possible from a massive store as yorselves .
0	i want this sorting asap ...
0	mr and mrs preston
0	absolutely fantastic !
0	i got exactly_what i wanted how i wanted it for a great price and quality to match .
0	i would definitely recommend using their services !
0	there website is easy to use and their staff are always helpful and answer my questions quickly and thoroughly .
0	the products are exactly_what you order and i have been able to return things easily and quickly when needed .
0	i would recommend using them , i did all my christmas shopping here which was much_easier than rambling through town during busy hours .
0	i '_ve ordered business_cards from another online supplier and been disappointed .
0	after a lot of research i decided to use moo - and i '_ve never been happier with an end_result like this at an affordable price .
0	brilliant business_cards at very high_quality and i could easily adapt and change my design on the website .
0	i definitely recommend using moo and will be using them in the future for my business from now on .
0	fantastic - keep it up !
0	i have had no bad_experiences from here at all !
0	all of the items i have purchased have been exactly as_described and cheaper_than ebay !
0	it took me ages to try to get the lense in my eye properly because it was so flimsy .
0	it ended_up tearing rendering the lense useless .
0	disgusted by the product .
0	the customer service , pricing and availability make this the one stop_shop for online supplements .
0	you '_ll never find a price that they wont beat by 0 %
0	i recently opened an account with next and was really disappointed .
0	i ordered some cultery £_00 + ( inc delivery ) and they looked like i got the from poundland .
0	the cheeeeeeapest plastic decor you could imagine on cheap plastic handles .
0	i had to send them back asap and of course i had to pay for the return as well .
0	now the only_thing that i '_ll order from them is flowers !!!!
0	!
0	ordered a camcorder and a freeview_box online , then had a littlewoods rep trying to convince me that i could pay next year for item .
0	i explained that i hadn_'_t recieved the item yet and then the rep tells_me that not only did i get the camcorder 0_weeks_ago i signed for it !!!!
0	as advised i checked the garden_shed whilst on the phone and found it soaking_wet ( was suppose to be signature needed and no card was left at my door ).
0	i have since returned it as not confident that it would be working_properly in the near_future and i had missed the event it was ordered for .
0	( when i asked the rep about the freeview_box she said it was out of stock ).
0	i am far from happy with littlewoods way of handling this fraudulet event .
0	i have complained twice and i recieved an_email_telling_me that the complaint has_been sent to the courier company but still i '_ve heard_nothing .
0	how am i suppose to be confident purchasing items from littlewoods when they show such little care for the fraud committed and the faith of their loyal_customers .
0	shocking !!!!!
0	!
0	recently spent some time in hospital and came home 0_days before my son '_s birthday .
0	i placed my order with amazon and son was skating around the house the next_day on his new skateboard .
0	thanks amazon , you saved the day once again .
0	flowers notthing like what i ordered , the colour very different ( dark ) looked like they should have been for a funeral and not a birthday .
0	then to add more embarrassment the roses were past the fully opened stage .
0	i '_ve never been so publicly embarrassed in all my life .
0	also no telephone service so you can not call them , i sent a complaint via_email and received template email with a promise to contact me asap .
0	but i '_ve heard_nothing .
0	don_'_t use this company they have no care nor respect for their customers .
0	**_update **
0	0th_february_0000
0	so iflorist said they would send my sister some flowers and guess_what ?
0	it didn_'_t happen !!!
0	this company is ridiculously unprofessional .
0	i emailed iflorist reminding them that the flowers had to be delivered by 0 . 00pm .
0	the reply stated that the driver would be contacted and then i '_d be emailed back .
0	this did not happen either .
0	the service is shockingly disgusting .
0	i just want my money back and i have insisted on this from iflorist .
0	let '_s see how long it is to take for this refund .
0	once again in case you have forgotten my advice in the first complaint : do not use this company !!
0	!
0	dissapointed that some things out of order but all in all great service with fast convenient delivery
0	surprisingly efficient , trustworthy and accurate info thank_you kathy !
0	hq_hair is the website for all things beauty , it has a wide_range of beauty products and all best brands to choose from .
0	delivery and service is quick and the prices are competitive , perfect !
0	i ordered 0 white horizon bar_stools on late tuesday night and they arrived first thing thursday_morning .
0	the stools were extremely easy to put_together and are supplied with alan key do so .
0	i am no diy expert and i had two children under age of 0 trying to help but in matter of minutes i had two fantastic bar_stools .
0	i hunted_high and low matching prices of bar_stools and these where the lowest_price , being cheap price doesn_'_t reflect on the quality , they are very well made .
0	they are very comfortable and the lever action to raise and lower stool is very smooth and easy .
0	the white faux_leather is white and not off white , look brilliant in my white_gloss_white and oak kitchen .
0	very happy with the stools and the quality if service from lakeland_furniture .
0	thank_you .
0	i recieved my items extremely quick and they are brilliant .
0	excellent value for money too
0	just ordered a new_bathroom_suite and i love it !
0	everything arrived on time and the advise i got was really useful , excellent customer service and really high_quality products !
0	i ordered a coat for a christmas_present and considering the busy time of year it was delivered within 00_hours .
0	i then had to return the jacket as it was too_big and wanted to exchange it , i called the customer service number and it was so easy and the customer service agent explained the process clearly and put my mind at rest that i would get my item back and within a short_timeframe .
0	good prices , quick service , polite and helpful staff - what more could you ask for when ordering online !
0	really easy to use , fast postage , love the free things that come in the packages .
0	i always recommend to people !
0	website really easy to navigate_around reviews are very useful , when trying to pick where to book , 0st time booked a holiday this way and was surprised to find how easy it all was booked hotel flights and transfers all via website .
0	fantastic service quick , easy an efficient .
0	would use again .
0	great communication and incredibly fast payment .
0	really like the option to print_off the paperwork at home instead of wiating for your pack to arrive .
0	i went via_topcashback and as a first_timer for using a courier it was really straight_forward and i liked all the options_available .
0	and the prices were good too !
0	it '_s so easy to use and you get paid for shopping !
0	what more could you ask for ?
0	i recommend topcashback to everyone !
0	i did a lot of research before replacing a very dodgy cheap lamona dishwasher that had been unreliable for about a year .
0	we decided on a £_000_+ neff after talking to a john_lewis salesman and reading which ?, however due to finances we had to lower our budget by £_000 .
0	we had slightly low expectations vs the neff however we are both very pleased with the baumatic .
0	beautifully quiet , due to the cutlery tray i can fit lots more in and everything comes out clean .
0	it feels sturdy and well built .
0	the negatives which i '_d already read about prior to buying were that it took quite a while to assemble and my husband got quite grumpy with the instructions and the trays can be wet post cycle , however importantly the plates are dry and once it '_s built those frustrations deminish !
0	i '_d definitely recommend for the price !
0	i ordered my bath 0_weeks_ago , 0 bath was delivered into the local_store and they found it was faulty , the 0nd bath was delivered to my house 0_weeks_later and was damaged .
0	my tub have been good at communicating but not with offering any confirmation as to when the new bath will be delivered .
0	instead i was asked what i expected from buying such a cheap bath !
0	i eventually rang the director steve marshall and he was very rude .
0	he said it was common_practice to have these problems in his industry and that he could not guarantee a delivery time because the drive might have a heartache or crash so he would never give a gaurantee .
0	i would strongly_suggest you ignore the cheap prices and pay £_00 more fomr a reputable_company .
0	update_: to clarify following laurie '_s comments i have not yet had a refund as he stated .
0	however they have not collected the goods yet ... not sure why he would say they have refunded me yet ...
0	the bigboy bean_bag is a great accessory for any lounge !
0	it '_s super comfy , super convenient and looks cool too !
0	service from infrun was also top_notch , very prompt delivery and easy to use website .
0	00 out of 00 !
0	i stupidly lost my first pair of ray - ban wayfarers on holiday in ibiza ( after only four days of owning them ).
0	needless to say i was absolutely_gutted and annoyed at the fact i '_d have to shell out another £_000 to replace them .
0	i decided to search the net to see if i could buy them any cheaper_than the full price i had initially spent in - store .
0	after doing a quick google_search , i stumbled_across sunglassesshop . com .
0	i was amazed_at how much_lower the prices were here than in the shops .
0	i was a bit_dubious at first , but having read a few reviews and researching the site a little , i quickly realised i had nothing to worry_about !
0	i placed my order ( using a 00_%_off discount_code that i found on the google sponsored ad ) and bought a pair of black ray - ban wayfarers for £_00 , plus free next_day delivery !!
0	absolutely amazing service and amazing price , i have recommended to all of my friends and will definitely be using this site again .
0	( hopefully i won_'_t lose this pair after four days though ...)
0	bought tickets to wireless for £_00 and very excited as rihannas only uk gig this year .
0	doulbe0 tickets informed us of every_stage , from email letting us know payment details , a text saying when tickets were dispatched and special delivery so that they definitley reached our flat .
0	could not have asked for a better service .
0	just got to enjoy the concert now :-)
0	will use them again definitly !!!

0	my iphone was coming with yodel .
0	i stayed in all day waiting and when tracked online that night they stated they had been to deliver at 0pm and nobody answered so they left a card .
0	i had no card and also have cctv on our apartments .... yet no one except for the postman that morning had attempted delivery .
0	rang customer service and they rearranged delivery for the saturday_morning ... still no delivery .
0	upon_calling customer_services couldn_'_t get through .
0	finally got through monday_morning and kept getting passed through departments and drivers .
0	got home from work on tuesday and the package had been dropped that morning with a neighbour - hardly safe for an iphone when they don_'_t know if we get on with our neighbours ...
0	worst delivery experience i '_ve ever had !!
0	!
0	would definitely buy from this company again .
0	great vendor , fast service and excellent communication .

0	hostelbookers has a good collection of available places to stay , and an excellent database of reviews , which is very helpful for a traveller trying to find the best place to stay .
0	in addition , the website design is simple but informative , allowing a person to quickly find the information one is looking for .

0	our pre_- booked accommodation with a different company let us down with 00 days to go until we flew to mallorca with our two year_old daughter .
0	we found the late deals section on james_villas and were so happy to find that we could book an entire villa with private_pool for much less_than we had been originally paying for an apartment with shared pool .
0	we did book over the phone , as it was last_minute and we had a few questions , but this was all dealt_with by the advisors with friendly efficiency .
0	confirmation , info sheets and documents were in my email inbox within half an_hour .
0	our accommodation was clean , well_equipped , and exactly as_described .
0	we found it first time of trying , using the extremely accurate driving directions emailed by the advisor .
0	the resort_rep was very friendly and helpful when we contacted her for some info .
0	in summary , a beautiful villa , managed by a fantastic company , and outstanding value for money ( especially when booked last_minute !)
0	- highly_recommended .
0	i chose this company because they offered the best value for money to buy back the brazilian currency i had .
0	i used a comparison website to search for potential companies and covent_garden fx came out on top .
0	they were very fast and changed my money for pound sterling almost_instantly .
0	one piece of advice : the business is located at the other side of covent_garden from where google_maps says it is located .
0	i '_ve booked a number of hostel through hostelbookers and i '_ve never had any_problems with them .
0	i also find their prices are almost always cheaper_than hostelworld '_s .
0	loads of choice and an easy to navigate site !
0	the website is really easy to use and they send the envelops for you really quick !
0	and money goes straight_into your bank_account !
0	fab !
0	the order arrived straight_away , not sure if iit was next_day as it was signed for by the manager downstairs but definatley within_0days ...
0	pleased to have received a loyalty_discount which i used on this order and means i can order in bulk .
0	always use to buy our printers and consumables they are cheaper_than others i have tried
0	quick postage , well_packaged & reasonable_prices !
0	they dont even deserve one star !!
0	this company are ripping_people off !
0	they have done this to many people judging_by the reviews .
0	sadly , i did not read these before i sent my perfectly good iphone .
0	they quoted me £_00 and offered me £_00 !
0	they then sent me an_email knowing i was displeased with this and so offered me £_00 .
0	frustratingly , they have credited my bank_account with £_00 !!!!!
0	i asked for the phone back many_times but they are charging me ten_pounds .
0	i am_currently in a dispute with them and am seeking further advice as they are clearly a bad company out to commit daylight_robbery !
0	avoid at all costs !!!!!
0	!
0	very happy with the service i received 0st time round , i then used them again !
0	i would highly_recommend sell - your - laptop to family and friends due to the nice , friendly and informative service that i received and no extra_charges to pick it up the laptop from the courier !
0	:) the methods of payments you have a choice of , and with in a couple of hours of them receiving my laptop , and assessing it , they then made the payment the same day .
0	extremely happy with the over all service , staff are friendly and they offer you the best prices for your laptops !
0	the website is easy to navigate and the updates i receive are very welcomed and informative .
0	the ordering process from beginning to end has always been spot_on .
0	i '_ve been buying different professional haircare products and always received them in time .
0	will buy in future as well cause of the best prices .
0	have lots of friends who is satisfied too .
0	will recommend them .
0	i '_ve been using hostelbookers for a few_years_now & i always book through them .
0	i don_'_t even bother to attempt looking at other_websites anymore .
0	this is by far the most helpful & efficient way to book a vacation !!
0	!
0	quick easy service
0	ordered headphones paid_extra for next_day delivery three_days on still_waiting .
0	they now say they have took the money but wont despatch the item as there is a discrepancy with my address .
0	what a load of rubbish .
0	cant find a number to call them .
0	so they have took my money but wont send goods .
0	please dont order from this company
0	brilliant and very fast service from sarah_hayes .
0	she was very polite , helpful and quick to source the problem and fix it for us .
0	thanks so much !
0	i could not fault her .
0	i am very happy with this company and this product - i ordered it on the tuesday and recieved by the friday , even living in north_east scotland !
0	the camera is better_than_expected and i willl be buying from this website again !
0	best deal on the internet - could not be_happier !
0	i must_say i am happy with the quality of the delivery .
0	however , way too expensive .
0	it '_s an awesome site which makes it really easy to find and book_hostels online .
0	most of the time i find that it '_s cheaper_than the other hostel booking sites and even the hostels own websites !
0	which i have to add ..... is also awesome =).
0	the site is really easy to use , being_able to look at the room type available without having to click on the hostel every time is a bonus for me , as is being_able to sort it by price ( either dorm or private ).
0	obviously having no booking_fees is also great and i personally like that i don_'_t have to sign up to the site to book things through it .
0	in all , well it '_s prety awesome really and i '_ve been using it for years when i '_ve needed it .
0	they have the lowes price of anyone
0	a very easy website to use .
0	anyvan provided some very competitive quotes which saved us a fortune .
0	the service worked exactly as_described and our bed was delivered to our door .
0	this worked out much_cheaper_than hiring a van ourselves and we wouldn_'_t_hesitate to use them again in the future .
0	[_name_] was great with the non - stop calls , she was like my conscious speaking .. i just had to put the money aside to finally do my website !
0	[_name_] didn_'_t stop creating until i was 000_% happy .
0	only_thing i '_m not happy about is it doesn_'_t have a mobile site , i can '_t see my website fully from my iphone_0s .
0	otherwise perfect service .
0	mazuma has exceeded my expectation yet again , such a speedy service with updates throughout the whole_process .
0	not only that but now bank transfers are available so money is in your account even quicker .
0	will_continue to use mazuma every time !
0	anytime i have placed an order it has always came within a few_days .
0	there website is very easy to use and their products are great value for money .
0	would definately recommend their company !
0	i recently bought a pre_- owned guitar , so there was only one in stock which showed when i ordered online .
0	i had the guitar in less_than 00_hours after ordering .
0	i even got a free bag included with the guitar , with a couple of plectrums in it !
0	i had to call the store because the guitar_strap i ordered was not included in the package .
0	the member of staff apologised and promised to send it straight_away ( even_though i insisted there was no rush ).
0	again , this package arrived next_day , with no_quibbles .
0	excellent service and would thoroughly_recommend .
0	if you want to buy a buggy that '_s not fit for purpose then be my guest my daughter is only 0_months and my buggy is currently back with them for the third time having collapsed with my daughter in it and i repeat for the third time !
0	i love my quinny_buzz well actually i used to love it now all i risk is harming my child every time i put her in it no refund offered no brand_new replacement only told there is nothing wrong with it .
0	why i would send my buggy off three_times for apparently nothing is beyond me !
0	they offer a really decent price for tyre and fitting .
0	when they came out to fit new tyre tony the tyre fiter was excellent , fitted the new tyre in no time and took the time to look at my other tyres and even put air into my front_tyres that where slightly down .
0	great customer service really went the extra_mile for me !
0	highly_recommend .
0	ordered a t - shirt for my husband on the thursday_afternoon , by friday_evening he was wearing it , such fast delivery !
0	excellent quality item which fits my husband well , and excellent communication from truffleshuffle , i '_ll be using them again as plenty of items caught my eye as i was searching for this .
0	not only do they have the best prices online , if you can find it cheaper elsewhere they will beat it .
0	shipping is always fast and there are always many different samples you can get " free " with order .
0	ordered late_afternoon on friday and received my brand_new toshiba 00 " the next_day on saturday_morning and driver called up to let_me know he '_s coming within a hour !
0	the support and system is really crap , they limit legal businesses as well and should avoid at all costs
0	received text with 0 hour time to receive the items and i did within that 0 hour time frame !
0	amazing service not sure whats with the bad_reviews
0	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate in recommending ecareers to friends .
0	the course i did in sage was thorough and easy to navigate , and the couple of times i had any_problems with passwords or certificates the online_chat was really quick , easy and friendly to use .
0	really great customer service .
0	000_% recommended .
0	impressed with fast efficient service and delivery .
0	would definitely use animed_direct again .
0	gjw_titmuss has an easy to use website , low_cost products of good quality and very prompt delivery .
0	i was extremely impressed and i would use them again !
0	kevin at holidays_please always got back to me asap .
0	i also found them dramatically cheaper_than other holiday websites .
0	would definitely use them again
0	i spoke with emma on a live_chat , she amended my invoice immediately and emailed it to me within_seconds .
0	very helpful and very fast !
0	i ordered a parcel and sighed when i got the email_saying it had been dispatched with yodel .... knowing full well how awful they are !
0	this time i waiting in all day on the day the tracking_information said it was out for delivery - nothing .
0	contacted the seller again this morning to complain ( as complaints to yodel are usually ignored / responded to with ' we don_'_t know ) and i was assured that the parcel was out for delivery again today and that i would get it today .
0	around lunchtime i rechecked the tracking_information .
0	the parcel was apparently delivered to me last night at 00pm ( even_though yodel only deliver until_0pm ) and i had apparently signed for it !
0	even_though i was fast asleep in bed by this time .
0	i can only_assume that yodel forged my signature ( so they ' re fraudulent as well as unreliable ) and stole the parcel for themselves ....... absolutely useless !
0	i was given a hour hour delivery slot - great - i thought !
0	half an_hour after that delivery slot ended i rechecked the tracking_information to find that they had apparently attempted delivery but no one was home !
0	i had been home all day !
0	after_trawling_through their awful automated menus on the customer service line , i finally found the local_depot number on a forum website ( it '_s not listed on dpd website ) and managed to speak to a human_being .
0	the man at the depot contacted the driver who said he attempted delivery and was here for 00_minutes and left a calling_card - ( i have a locked mailbox and it wasnt there !)
0	so i can only_assume they just couldn_'_t be bothered to deliver ..... i '_m wasting another day waiting in tomorrow for the ' redelivery ( i . e .
0	first_attempt in my view ) so we shall see ....
0	very easy to use , simply printed , posted and got paid !
0	it was all straightforward until they emailed me and said they '_d found a fault with my phone .
0	it worked_perfectly well and i only wanted to sell it as i '_d upgraded and need some extra_cash to put towards my holiday .
0	i now don_'_t have the box as i didn_'_t need to send it with the phone .
0	so i '_ll get less selling_privately .
0	not at all happy .
0	will be using mazuma next time ...
0	also received an_email after i '_d sent the phone saying they hadn_'_t received it ( rude , give me a chance i work full time )
0	not impressed !
0	order cam earlier_than_expected , everything was well_packaged and it great condition , not forgetting the little sweets they give you with every order made !
0	never_fails to disappoint me , amazing service !!!!
0	!
0	recently bought a few items for my wedding preps and found that glitter_monster was great .
0	prices were really reasonable and very quick in delivery .
0	definiately would recommend .
0	paid for an early morning delivery of an item .
0	been sat in all day waiting and still no delivery at 0 . 00pm .
0	i have been calling the company all day , and ran up a rather big mobile bill in the process as i was just left on hold , with no sign of anybody answering .
0	i have emailed them several_times , and no response to the emails either .
0	the website has a tracking_facility which at present is telling_me that my item hasn_'_t left the depot yet , but is also saying that my delivery was signed for at 0am this morning .
0	the information supplied gives a surname of who signed for the parcel , but funnily_enough it is neither my surname , nor my partners , or actually any of my neighbours either .
0	no card has_been left to say it was signed for by somebody_else .
0	my delivery actually required me personally to sign for my delivery , and to show my photo id too , now since i have both my passport and driving_license , obviously whoever " signed " for my parcel couldn_'_t have showed my id .
0	i am absolutely_disgusted by this company , and would seriously recommend that people steer_clear of them .
0	if you order something online and know that this company will be the courier , i urge you do not place the order !
0	!
0	i am now out of pocket because of losing a days pay waiting around for them , i have run up a huge bill trying to get_hold of them , and i '_ve lost the item i should have received .
0	extremely angry , and looking to further my complaint about them .
0	i had a lot of messing_around with envirofone , so got my phone back and sent it straight to mazuma .
0	i sent my mobile to them yesterday , today it has_been processed and the money is already in my account !
0	i am absolutely over the moon with this service .
0	i would definitely recommend them to everybody looking to sell their old phone .
0	honestly couldn_'_t fault them .
0	i will only ever use these from now on .
0	thank_you so much for a great , fast and easy service !
0	i sent my iphone_0s to them yesterday .
0	i went on to my account today to find they '_d knocke the price down by £_000 because the phone " tested faulty ".
0	there is a tiny cosmetic mark on the front and when i rang customer_services i was told that this classes the phone as faulty .
0	the advisor told me that they sell the phone on so they can '_t accept cosmetic damages !
0	i '_m absolutely_disgusted that because of a tiny little mark they won_'_t pay the price that the phone is worth !
0	the fact is , it costs £_00 to make the repair to fix the cosmetic_damage so they ' re expecting to make a huge profit out of taking_advantage of my " naivety ".
0	well i '_m not giving them that satisfaction .
0	i '_ve requested the phone back and i will sell it on myself for what the phone is actually worth .
0	rip_off merchants , avoid at all costs !!!!
0	!
0	simply got a hd cable for my new tv .
0	ordered online and picked_up at store .
0	very simple and good price
0	my friend used funktionevents because of their good reviews and helpfulness on the phone .
0	i told her at the time of booking the hen_party that i doubt they will deliver everything as good as they promise for that low price , but to my amazement they delivered everything brilliantly .
0	our hotel in manchester was very centre ( the midland hotel ) and very luxury with a swimming_pool .
0	the service here was great and i was happy that funktion managed to get us in there for a hen_party .
0	activities - dance party , sms treasure_hunt and meal .
0	these were all excellent and exactly_what we had been told ( no little nasty suprises ) and again all very central around the hotel .
0	overall , even_though my friend dealt_with funktion_events , i must_admit that they did everything we asked for at a great price .
0	use this company if you want no_hassle and top quality !
0	loved the cocktail_making class which was part of my friends hen_party .
0	everyone enjoyed it and had plenty of cocktails to drink plus food .
0	thanks and will be recommending
0	i ordered 0 pairs of contact_lenses as it was the first time i had used lenstore .
0	i was pleased with the very quick delivery , and as far as i can tell the lenses are the same as what i usually get from my opticians , but significantly_cheaper .
0	i '_ll be ordering more !
0	i '_ve ordered quite a few things from very and i '_ve never had any troubles with any aspect of them .
0	delivery is always very fast and p_&_p_charges are always fair .
0	i love wowchers !
0	they have so many different things on offer there '_s something for everybody and the prices are always brilliant !
0	i have used a site like this before and not had a good experience , but mazuma_mobile were brilliant !
0	the website was easy to use , the price was good and the service was problem free .
0	the money was transferred_into my account a few_days after i posted them the phone - easy_peasy .
0	my order arrived extremely quickly , far faster_than_expected !
0	!
0	i recieced email_updates throughout the process and was kept up to date with when they were dispatched and delivered .
0	really pleased with my purchase as i '_ve been looking for some replacement running glasses for months !
0	thanks for a really efficient service , highly_recommended .
0	the team at cambridge printing . com are more than 0_stars in our opinion .
0	our quotes come_back within minutes and are always the most competitive , they are very conscientious regarding our delivery dates and times as we often need things turned round ridiculously fast or delivered to random hotels !
0	they have done special printing for us of one off things things we '_ve needed like posters or intricate pop_ups , and sometimes they even deliver to us by cycle courier in the snow and rain .
0	we '_d never go_anywhere_else for our printing .
0	well_done cambridge , you ' re the best :))))
0	from everyone at clickview ltd
0	always foun what i need on amazon and the prices are great !
0	always find what i want and the prices are right .
0	always received great service .
0	the whole_experience from beginning to end was easy , seemless and hasle free !
0	what a pleasant_experience .
0	i will certainly recommend mazumamobile to friends , family and colleagues !
0	thank_you .
0	quite happy with the main product and speed of delivery , but unfortunately the manufacturer had changed the item : this hadn_'_t been reflected in the product description .
0	in essence , we '_d chosen the item because the ' freebie ' it came with made it good value compared to other_sellers .
0	unfortunately , the freebie item was no_longer included .
0	when i contacted customer_services , they were great , apologised and assured me that they would contact the manufacturer , who would send the ' missing ' item directly .
0	this was followed the next_day by another email_confirming that the item would be sent , but then by yet another email the day after , telling us that the product had been changed and no_longer came with the freebie .
0	no offer was made of a partial_refund or other recompense , which was disappointing , and i got no further reply when i emailed to complain .
0	a shame , as up to that point was happy with the service .
0	have used hostelbookers a few_times and would def recommend .
0	secure your hostel with 00_% deposit and pay no booking_fees , unlike_other similar_websites .
0	search filters made choosing a lot_easier .
0	i was very happy with the selection and great deals .
0	very good , easy to use website , competitive price relative to hostelworld . com and no fee !
0	amazing !
0	i always love buying with fragrance_direct .
0	always !
0	when the product didn_'_t arrive due to postal issues , they immediately sent out another which arrived rapidly .
0	i '_ve been very impressed
0	i love google and i couldnt live without it .
0	a credit to the internet , super , super ace site .
0	if i could kiss it i would
0	rubbish , site keeps crashing , rubbish layout , hard to use .
0	i quicker to get in your car spend 0 hours in the supermarket and come home than trying to order a weekly_shop on this site .
0	i will not use again until the site is improved .
0	bad layout , bad company , bad seller , bad products , i will never use ebay again as long as i live .
0	when receiving my bath suite the courier was going to leave it in the middle of my drive but eventually pushed it into my garage after explaining i had cleared a space .
0	i had ordered what the plumber had told me so left it for him to check when he was coming , when installing it we soon realised we had the wrong sink 0 holes instead of 0 , when i rang up they apologised and said they would send the correct one out but couldn_'_t send it out till the day after next as they '_d missed the courier however the plumber could not come_back then as they had another job so i '_m without a sink when i received the correct one the plastic bit that goes in the drainage hole was snapped and broken luckily i had another from the wrong sink to replace it , the following_day after_realising we had the wrong sink when the plumber was installing the shower_tray the waste was missing to save time he popped out to buy one but the cheapest was £_00 i rang customer service to tell them and by that time i was very frustrated i explained this was the second mistake and i was not happy they agreed to pass it on to the manager and the manager would ring me this was 0am in the morning it got to 0pm and still no phone_call so i rang them back and i was told i had been given a refund i asked how much and i was told £_00 !
0	this was certainly not good enough for having the wrong sink and no waste_pipe and having to pay £_00 for another waste_pipe i was told that is how much they pay for there waste_pipe so they couldn_'_t give me anymore ... ok this is understandable but for all the messing_around and mistakes i would certainly expect more than £_00 i was told i had only paid £_00 . 00 for the shower_tray and was spoken to like i should be greatful for £_00 .
0	i asked how i could make a complaint and basically was fobbed_off as that '_s the number i would ring to make a complaint or i can send an_email which is to them anyway so i did this i emailed and asked for a reply from the manager but i still didn_'_t get anywhere it took 0_days to get a reply from the manager and was told i should of checked my items and they had given me £_00 as a goodwill_gesture .
0	disgusting customer_care and awful service i would not recommend buying from this company due to mistakes and bad service i am £_00 out of pocket and i am still without a sink i will never buy from them again as my custom was truly not appreciated and £_00 was a shocking goodwil gesture for mistakes and stress
0	received money the next_day very fast and reliable , will use again !
0	!
0	i spend so much money on beauty products and get nothing in return .
0	with hqhair , i can spend the money i would anyway , and get a free gift too !
0	i love this website and will_continue to make large purchases ( especially for my urban_decay foundation ) for as long as this site runs !
0	thankyou for my free gifts !
0	:)
0	initial advised by vets to start my somewhat overweight cat on a special_diet - dr jill '_s metabolic .
0	extortionate price at the vets and very difficult to source online due to it being a new diet and also requires vet support .
0	found viovet to be both exceptionally good value for money and provided excellent up to date information and progress on order !
0	will be buying from here again !!
0	!
0	my orders always arrive really quickly and i '_ve never had an issue with anything i '_ve ordered from them .
0	i love how they will let you know if something comes back into stock .
0	my recent order was a t - shirt i wanted to get my boyfriend for christmas .
0	his size wasn_'_t in stock so i asked to be told when it was .
0	that '_s exactly_what they did and now i have his present all ready to go !
0	amazing site with amazing customer_care and very professional .
0	a large_amount of products of any prize range .

0	my mother and father are both medical patients and a considerable_amount of our money is spent on buying medications for them .
0	at first i used to buy them from medical stores but then on my friend ’_s recommendation decided to give chemist_direct a try .
0	i am happy that i made this decision because the medications remain the same but the prices are low which means that i can save up on 000_dollars atleast every_month .
0	got my items on time no problem .
0	however , disappointed on how it was packaged , i ordered a pair of hunter_boots and two_pairs of hunter socks which were squashed into the box , few scuff marks on the boots which came off thankfully .
0	other than that service was very good .
0	______________________________________________________________
0	update_: few_days ago i received a phone_call from country_house outdoors to say they read my review , asked if my item are okay and i am able to send the boots back from a new pair if damaged , as stated the marks did come off with a little_bit of rubbing the other items were fine .
0	they did compensate with a £_00 off voucher , which was a pleasant_surprise as its very rare for a company to even offer anything .
0	again very pleased with the service , would recommend .
0	added two extra stars for the after care event .
0	website is well_designed and easy to navigate , good product information and checkout is a breeze .
0	they even offer finance for large purchases , will definitely use for my next bathroom project !
0	great communication at all_stages of order , everything delivered together , competitive_pricing and easy to use checkout facility .
0	mazuma_mobile was easy to use .
0	quoted price for phone was given , and issued funds were received quickly .
0	the site has a friendly , clear and easy to use interface .
0	i was concerned cause it was my very first time using a site like this .
0	but everything turned ou just fine , the easiest reservation ever :)
0	firstly , i have bought a few things from groupon which were all fine , until i had to call them about one of the merchants .
0	i bought a voucher for some tickets to a murder_mystery event on a particular date .
0	the instructions say you must confirm your booking with merchant a minimum of a week prior to the event , however it is impossible to reach the merchant as they never answer or return calls left on their machine and their email addresses don_'_t work .
0	i reported this to groupon and they said it will take 00 working_days for them to investigate at which point i must call them back for the result as they will not call me .
0	about a week_later i got an_email from groupon saying they need my email address and phone number to pass to the merchant which i provided ( obviously they already have this and could surely have asked for permission to share details when the complaint was raised ).
0	i waited another 00 days or so and called their call_centre again and they said that it had been passed only 0 working_days ago to customer_care who would need another 00 working_days to investigate !
0	i complained as this would take us beyond the date that the event was taking place , the agent i spoke to was unhelpful and a bit rude and said i either wait or have groupon_vouchers - i actually just wanted to go to the event so i said should i go or not as we don_'_t know if it is tracking place but the agent just said she could not advise and that the voucher did not expire for a few_months - how could this be when the event was in less_than 0_weeks ?
0	i asked for a manager who was a lot more pleasant and said he understood and he would raise the issue again and explain that i need an answer in less_than 00 working_days as it is urgent , he also offered to credit me £_00 as a gesture .
0	this entire conversation took over 00_minutes on the phone .
0	the very next_day i received an_email from groupon saying as they haven_'_t heard from me they will be closing my enquiry !
0	i could not believe it , i replied_saying i had spent over 00_minutes on the phone only yesterday and it was ridiculous as i was promised this would be dealt_with not closed , i requested someone call me to discuss it , but it has_been 0_days now and i have not heard_anything - even_though they advertise emails will be replied to within 00_hours .
0	basically i '_ve been waiting almost a month and am no further forward , i don_'_t know if i should turn_up for the event or not .
0	clearly groupon '_s processes are poorly organised and not customer friendly .
0	it appears that if the merchant is good groupon is fine to buy from , but if you have a problem don_'_t expect groupon to help !
0	they rock !
0	i came_across their site while_searching for a weight_loss supplement .
0	not only do they carry a ton if product their prices are super reasonable !
0	i would have paid twice the amount at a gnc store for the supplement i wanted and that '_s including shipping !
0	so blessed to have come_across them !
0	my fridge_freezer_broke_down so i needed a replacement as soon as possible .
0	i wanted a reliable , basic and sensibly_priced unit with a fast delivery , i also need my broken unit recycled .
0	ao had the model i wanted and could deliver next_day , i spoke to friends that had also used ao and they couldn_'_t recommend them highly_enough .
0	i ordered on - line which was easy and simple to do , i received text and emails_confirming details and everything went_smoothly on the day of delivery .
0	delivery was really quick , was packaged well and all the items were as_described .
0	very reliable , would recommend and will use again in the near_future .
0	really quick delivery and free which is an extra amazing bonus and packaged really well .
0	wouldn_'_t_hesitate from buying from argento again and would highly_reccomend .
0	i had my first conference the other day , powwownow has the easiest set_up and the conference went great !
0	will be using powwownow for future calls from now on .
0	hostelbookers is so easy to book_hostels or any other place to stay when traveling .
0	you simply put in the information of where you will be traveling and what dates and the website gives you all your options to chose from extremely quick .
0	they compare every place to stay that matches your travel dates .
0	not only do they compare price , but also location , atmosphere , and other special characteristics of each place .
0	it is amazingly easy and fast and i recommend it to anyone !
0	i ordered 0 items for christmas_presents ; sjp nyc x0 , halle berry gift set , oo0 spray with gift .
0	very happy with the halle berry as it was a gift for a work_colleague .
0	the nyc '_s , i had to just give to my mum and sis because they were so small .
0	not a good price .
0	i am extremely disappointed in the fact that the oo0 bought for my step dad arrived with an elastic_band holding the spray to the gift .
0	surely , you could find a better way to package this so it doesn_'_t look like i '_ve bought it off a market_stall ?
0	i have now had to purchase a box just to make this look half decent .
0	really like this website , its cheap , you get freebies , fast delivery .
0	its just amazing .
0	recommend to everyone and from now in it will be the only website i use for perfume and aftershave .
0	purchased a jacket in december from this website , a day or two later they email me and tell me i will not be receiving it as it is out of stock .
0	i went back on to the website and noticed the jacket was still there only they had added an extra £_00 to the price .
0	when i asked about it i was ignored .
0	been trying to get my refund ever_since and on monday they told me my refund had been processed into my account , it is now friday an there is still no sign of it !
0	every time i email customer_services i am ignored .
0	worst website i have ever shopped from in my life the customer service is just disgusting , i advise everyone to avoid this website .
0	my husband purchased a cinema surround system from these people and whilst there are certainly better systems out there , it is a great system for the price we bought it for .
0	you always know what you ' re getting with these people and when you phone them you always get someone_who_knows what they are talking_about .
0	bought a leather_sofa online and it was delivered in 0_weeks .
0	the sofa is fantastic quality and the service i have received has_been exemplary .
0	well_done tesco !
0	whilst their prices are brilliant i feel that their customer service leaves a lot to be desired as i bought an iron from them 0 month_ago and it broke .
0	when i tried to return it they tried to make out that i had dropped it !!
0	won_'_t buy from them again .
0	i needed some replacement glasses after mine broke and they managed to get the frame i wanted even_though they did not list them on their website .
0	i got the glasses with free lenses delivered to my door 0_days_later and they didn_'_t even charge a delivery fee .
0	the glasses are excellent quality and i '_ll definately use them again if my prescription changes .
0	magnificent shop .

0	i ordered flowers 0_days before i wanted them delivered , they were a suprise for my sisters_birthday . not only didnt they turn_up but when they did they were half_dead and ended_up in the bin the next_day . absolutely no remorse from company so will never use them again .
0	i ordered some goggles from here that said " in stock " online .
0	i then emailed a week_later after_hearing_nothing else , only to be told that they were waiting to receive them from the supplier in another 0 - 00 days ( very vague ).
0	so another week went by , so i emailed again .
0	the same thing was said , so i asked to cancel ( as i am shortly leaving the country and don_'_t have time to wait around .
0	i was then kindly suggested some alternatives ( none even remotely similar and two at_least £_000 below my price range ).
0	i picked the goggles as they were a certain spec that i desired and the alternatives were none of these .
0	when i said the word " cancel " they responded within the hour .
0	so why , before this did it take a day or so more ?
0	they also didn_'_t confirm my refund until i emailed them twice .
0	they may aswell have chucked my money back at me .
0	overall , i am totally appalled .
0	what a shocking service !
0	i just completed office 0000 course .

0	i was slightly_nervous_about ordering lenses online , but i have been ordering from lenstore for around a year and have always been very satisfied with the service .
0	there was only one occasion when the lenses did not arrive , but as soon as i notified the company , a replacement was sent straight_away .
0	usually they take a couple of days to arrive and as they are in a small box they can be posted trough the letterbox , so no need to collect from the depot .
0	i wanted to treat my husband for our first year wedding_anniversary plus celebrating 00 years together in total .
0	got fantastic tickets practically almost on the park , i knew they were going to be expensive tickets and wanted to buy them from a reputable_company .

0	mrs stephanie kitson
0	great service , was easy to choose the drink i wanted which was very hard to get_hold from any local_shops .
0	would definitely have repeat_custom from this website .
0	we are having huge problems with sky , their call_center are rude and do not bother even read the emails and reply with something irrelevant .
0	our broadband and land - line have not been activated now 0_days past activation date !
0	has_been over 00hrs we were told to wait to get a call back .
0	no - one has called .
0	i am fed_up and just want to cancel so i can go somewhere_else where i can receive the services we are paying for .
0	my recent delivery did not turn_up , no phone_call from asda , nothing !
0	we called their customer_services several_times , to be either fobbed_off , or lied to .
0	we were told we would be called back , but no one called back .
0	we called the next_day to cancel , however because of this my money is still being held .
0	luckily i have the money to place an order elsewhere .
0	so far it '_s been five days_later , and my money is wrongfully being held .
0	asda may say the fault here lays with the bank , however if asda had delivered the shopping that i had paid for , we wouldn_'_t be in the situation .
0	we have written a letter of complaint but are still_waiting for a response .
0	after a non delivery you would think they would contact us , but i guess that '_s why they ' re cheap !
0	had a bit of a defect in product and safercigs were quick to rectify the situation :) we '_ll definitely buy from again and recommend you to as well !
0	second order , needed a new charger and quick for my 00000 '_s i emailed daz to ask if i bought it in the morning , if he would be able to ship it same day , sure enough he could !
0	i got it in less_than 00hrs from time of purchase .
0	spot_on !
0	daz even gave_us a phone_call , customer service from his company is amazing !
0	i had been researching car seats for months and getting so confused and then i found winstanleys !
0	i wish i '_d just gone to them first !
0	i emailed first of all to check the models they had in store and got a very quick response , i then phoned to check the stock which they were able to confirm and ensured the product i liked the look of would be held at the store ready for me to purchase if i liked it which i thought was great .
0	as soon as i arrived at the store , the staff i spoke to were extremely confident in their product knowledge and extremely willing to demonstrate products .
0	i was so impressed with the checks that were carried_out when trying the seat in the car .
0	i had previously been to 0 major high_street stores to look at the same seat and they failed to carry out vital checks but the winstanleys staff were straight on to these therefore ensuring my child '_s safety to the highest_level , what more could you ask for ?
0	thank_you so much winstanleys for the fantastic service , knowledge and safety level checks , we are extremely pleased with the besafe isofix izi combi seat and highly_recommend the product as well as you !
0	we will be back soon !
0	ridiculously_expensive i don_'_t know how they justify their prices .
0	greed greed greed and ripping customers off left right and centre .... we need competitive companies to do away with the 0st_class stamp !
0	i '_ve been a scottish_power customer for 0 years and finally i '_ve had enough !
0	( 0 years previous address ( great service ) ... 0 years current address ) current home was intitially british_gas which i thought i '_d switch back to scottish_power
0	this last_year alone i noticed everytime i topped_up on my pre_- pay card they were taking money at the same time .
0	£_00 they would take £ 0 and leave me with £_00 credit .
0	i phoned them up asked what they were playing at that i was a pay & go customer ... they put the blame down to switching from british_gas ... that british_gas owe me the money .
0	phone british_gas .... i didn_'_t owe any money and was never in debt to british_gas it was nothing to do with them it was scottish_power .
0	phoned scottish_power they give me a pin to wipe it off .
0	.... few_weeks_later debt on it again .
0	this time same reason ... only 0_weeks electricity was unaccoutnable for when i switched .
0	i explained i '_ve already paid for my eletcricity ... i '_m not paying for it twice .
0	same thing again gave_me a pin wiped it off .
0	this time they were taking £ 0 ... this went on 0 - 0 times ..... were they wiped it clean .
0	then the final time 0th or 0th time i flipped and had enough ...
0	i topped_up £_00 ...£ 0 . 00 off ... i checked my meter ... it showed as 00 . 00 in debt .
0	bear in mind i hadn_'_t noticed them taking the £ 0 . 00 a week because it was a much smaller amount .
0	i contacted scottish_power who asked me for my meter_reading ... i gave it them and the woman on the phone said you are not £_00 .
0	in debt your are now £_00 in debt .
0	i asked how can i be in debt i do not get £_00 worth free of electricity .. i pay for what i use i pay as you go .
0	this time scottish_power were not for wiping the debt off ....
0	i '_d had enough i contacted consumer_rights ombudsman to put an official_complaint in about how badly we were being treated ... to investigate sp because surely this is fraud tapping into to pay as you go customers meters and adding debt on their meters without us knowing .
0	this had happened to us 0 times .
0	i got a knock on my door same week having problems with sp from a new energy_supplier economy energy not on comparison_sites because they are guaranteed 00_% cheaper_than all the big 0 rip_offs !
0	so i switched only last_week because i can '_t take this with scottish_power anymore .... this morning had a phone_call from sp on a sunday morning from a witheld number .... bearing in mind scottsh power are not open on a sunday said he was clearing the £_00 debt and he can see there was always a problem with the meter_reading ... that i shouldn_'_t have been in debt because i '_m pay as you go ....
0	so what about all the money i have paid weekly in debt ???
0	... i '_ve never been given that back ... all as i '_ve been given is the meter wiped .
0	not any of the money i have paid on this so called debt !
0	.... sp only acting now because i have took it up with the ombudsman .
0	i '_m just one customer they have tried to rip_off ....... how many vulnerable customers are out there who don_'_t actually notice debt being added on their meters ???
0	my advice is put your key in and scroll_through the options it will tell you if there is any debt and how much they are taking a week !!!!!!!!
0	.....& take up with consumer complaints ombudsman who will act for free on your behalf !!!!!!!!!
0	because this is theft of an energy_supplier who already get enough of us customers !
0	every time i make a purchase with this company there is a problem !!!!!
0	!
0	they '_ve sent my items with holes covered up with security tags .... items suppposed to be new with tags turn_up with no tags !
0	there is always an item out of stock ....
0	and when you are really looking_forward to receiving something like a rare opulence ballerina dress they send you a shoddy side train dress not what i ordered and contacting them by telephone is terrible !!!!!!!!!!
0	not only that they don_'_t send you a returns sticker ..... i have to pay my own returns cost and wait 00 days for a refund !!!!
0	avoid if you don_'_t want to be disappointed because i '_m disappointed in every transaction i make
0	no other competitor has_been able to match supplementwarehouse prices .
0	i '_m 000_% satisfied with the quality of my products and how quickly i receive them .
0	the free gifts are always great !
0	apart_from holidays bought from very well_known holiday companies this is easily the biggest single purchase i have ever made over the internet .
0	it was an eternity_ring , bought as a surprise for my 00th_wedding_anniversary .
0	i have to confess the last piece of jewellery i bought without_any input from my wife was the engagement_ring , 00 years_ago .
0	i knew nothing about the 0 cs or purchasing diamonds .
0	my starting point was jewellery shops , both high_street and independent , there were many fine looking rings but i just wasn_'_t sure i was getting the biggest choice so i turned to the internet .
0	i spent months researching all online jewellery companies but i kept returning to purely_diamonds .
0	it certainly helps that the website has a very professional look , unlike_some of their_competitors , it was also extremely_helpful on education .
0	i was able to use their tools to work out my wife '_s ring size and the pictures and animations of the rings were really helpful for look .
0	i settled on a design and size and made my selection and order on the internet .
0	it was then the nerves set in , had i done the right thing , i decided to email the company .
0	i was emailed straight back by stephanie and from then on she was able to put my mind at ease .
0	the ring was delivered as promised .
0	it looked amazing to me but the true test was giving it to my wife .
0	she was delighted and despite the fact it has_been on her finger for 0_days now she still can '_t stop looking at it .
0	i am more than satisfied that i received great service and the ring is more than value for money .
0	i would recommend purely_diamonds to anyone !
0	i have posted this through my wife '_s fb account as i don_'_t have one .
0	i spoke to michelle after i thought i had selected the wrong drop_off point with ups .
0	she then altered the details for me and re - sent the delivery note to my email but it still showed the wrong_address .
0	i went back through to her and explained the situation , she was more than happy to help and was patient too !
0	she cancelled the order , gave_me a credit to my account and re - ordered it for me , correcting the error .
0	she was friendly , patient and professional throughout .
0	i '_m thankful for all her help !

0	ordered a barca strip for my sons_birthday waited 0_days then checked online tracking and said it was delivered to my ' porch ' 0_days ago .
0	phoned customer service and said they would check with hermes delivery and see what happened .
0	i then had to phone back as surprise_surprise they didn_'_t phone me !
0	told that it was delivered to me personally which is amazing as i was at work all that day and my 00 year_old neighbour across my landing who never leaves his house said no one had been by all day .
0	again phoned back and told same thing but that they always side with customer !
0	what a joke my son was left gutted and i '_m hoping for a refund but i '_ve reported them to watchdog and to my bank for fraud so that '_s .
0	how bad they are !
0	i think some tramps hermes guy has spotted my parcel and lifted it as barca kids strips are hard to get right now .
0	what a sad existence to steal from a company and make a fool of yourself !
0	would recommend to anyone .
0	thank_you so much so pleased arrived quick and in one piece :)
0	like many of you ordered my big_boy bean_bag !!
0	via_groupon .
0	still yet to arrive !!
0	ordered on the 00th_november_0000
0	e . mail several_times after giving up trying to call them , and they now have automated line about bean_bags .
0	last e . mail was delivery in feb before 00th , like others saying check site order page for details ... etc
0	& an_email from groupon saying £_00 off next purchase .... i cant_afford any of their stuff , so gave it to my mum ...( she informed me of these numourus complaints !!)
0	at_least now i dont feel alone in the matter .
0	i have contacted bbc '_s watchdog via their website , advise you do also .
0	i '_m also concidering refund from groupon even if i loose my £_00 odd p_&_p from infurn as seen similar priced / sized bean_bags instock at my local range store !
0	!
0	this has not put me off groupon as ive ordered from them in the past and been very satisfied .
0	i do however want answers from infurn and a definative answer as to when my itm will actually arrive !
0	!
0	was told feb 00th ..... well on site its now saying calender week 00 ... lets see shall we ......
0	i have been in my house all this time without a flat screen television immediately i joined very i know that one day i will have my own television .
0	i started with £_000 credit giving to me and keep on manage with the money until now that my credit has improve .
0	last_week i when for that television but unfortunate for me i did not place what i want i make a mistake and go for wrong want i did called very direct and i was answer immediately that if my product come i should send it back with the delivery person and your money will be credited back to my account then immediately i can go back to the site and get what i want .
0	so this morning i went to very site and got just what i want which was excellent and sample to get .
0	i will advised everyone to join very and see the excellent business the have and no one will never be disappointed .
0	that every thing you want , you will away have even if you want to talk with the team you will alway be happy because someone will alway be there for people .
0	for that reason i need to thank everyone working with very experically manager director assisstant manager and all the sale assistant .
0	is great do_business with you people
0	i had lots of questions and leah was extremely_helpful with everything i needed to know .
0	i even went to the company and spoke to her in person again , was very helpful .
0	i had my printed work in a few_days_later so very quick and the quality of them are brilliant .
0	i was dubious_about ordering currency online , however , after checking the reviews for the currency_club i was comfortable in using them .
0	they also had one of the best rates at the time with no commission and free next_day delivery when ordering before 00pm .
0	i ordered about 0 . 00pm and still received my order next_day .
0	i was kept_informed via_email of progress and when my order was on the way .
0	very pleased with the rate , service and speed .
0	the last four orders i '_ve had from dorothy perkins have been problematic , from a broken zip on a dress , faulty pumps , laddered tights , a dress that stunk of cigarettes , and my most_recent one , a dress that was lovely until i washed it , now is covered in frayed elastic bits so is not wearable again !
0	i have now lost my patience and give up with them , most certainly will never order from them again .
0	i '_m surprised they are still trading !
0	from my first experience of specsavers i will be returning to my previous opticians !
0	the only_reason i tried them out was because i had a free eye_test voucher .
0	the optician said i had a very slight prescription and didn_'_t need glasses , but proceeded to try to sell me reading_glasses .
0	the whole atmosphere seemed more of a sales place and out of about 00 to 00 other people in there at the time , i was the only one to walk out without purchasing anything .
0	after possibly the worst online shopping_experience ever - no thanks to miragerecords0000 , chemical_records restored my faith .
0	my purchase with m0000records was for a pack of ' rock on wall ' vinyl frames , which i paid_extra delivery for also , after them not arriving and not 0 single reply to my numerous polite emails , i finally spoke to dave who told me in so many words to do0 , this all without my order arriving .
0	in the meantime , i thought all was lost but one more try to get them as the ones in john_lewis werent quite as nice , and tadaathere was chemical_records !
0	i called them ob the website listed number for assistance first to ensure they were real and if would take order over phone after what happened above , this wasnt possible but they were friendly and provided reassurance that this purchase would be as hassle_free as you '_d expect it to be , and that it was !
0	website clear about shipping and delivery dates , which were exact my order arrived on time and in great condition .
0	to be fair , im probably a lil over excited at chemical_records right now , as had such a poop time with miragerecords0000 , but either way top score for a top store !
0	thank youuuuu , x
0	i ordered the guitar as a christmas_present for my sister .
0	i have never bought from this site before and was a little_nervous , however i am more than pleased .
0	the guitar arrived today , ( i only ordered it yesterday ) and it '_s in perfect_condition and it '_s simply beautiful !
0	it put a smile on my sister '_s face .
0	( she got the present early ).
0	would definitely recommend .
0	felt a little_nervous after_reading all the bad_reviews that yodel have , however , i received excellent service .
0	the package was delivered the next_day in excellent condition and the delivery driver was very friendly .
0	this site has everything you need and it ships from wisconsin so everyone can get a fair price on shipping .
0	my car was picked_up and delivered when expected .
0	they kept me informed_throughout the whole_process .
0	i will definitely use their service again .
0	i chose to use divorce_online because all the documents that had to be filled out was quite overwhelming .
0	divorce_online did most of the work and checked my documents before they got sent to court .
0	they prepared the documents and would inform_me when i needed to print and sign something etc .
0	the online tracker was quiet useful as it allowed me to log on and see what stage of the divorce process i was at .
0	all in all an excellent service .
0	i hate this company with a passion - no sweat if you booked the correct tickets and the train turns_up .
0	book the wrong tickets or need a refund and it will cost you dearly .
0	not just the cost of the tickets but the numerous_calls to their indian_call_centres where they recite a speech - no matter_how many_times you tell them otherwise they will repeat the speech ... nightmare .
0	would never use again : 0 (
0	great site , great value , easy to navigate round ... pages and pages of offers can be a bit mundane tho - best to search what you ' re looking for , then find the best price / offer : 0 )
0	great site , simple to use , love the favourites / usuals - makes the weekly shopping nightmare turn into a dream come true : 0 )
0	been banking with santander for 0yrs now , efficient , simple and secure .
0	very happy and would not go back to barclays for love nor money : 0 )
0	have booked several holidays through thomascook . com and would recommend them .
0	site is easy to navigate round , holidays have been superb with an option to review upon return .
0	payment pages very secure , would use again and recommend to a friend : 0 )
0	spent lots of time searching out the ideal destination through first choice - first time i '_ve ever used this company and love the " my first choice " account you get to use when you '_ve booked a holiday .
0	easy to navigate round , secure_payments and instant email_confirmation .
0	a big_thumbs_up all_round : 0 )
0	ordered several_times from this site , great value for money and easy to navigate round ... would shop there again and recommend to a friend : 0 )
0	wherever_possible i always use paypal due to its secure_payments and dispute centre its very difficult to pull a fast one meaning happy buyers and sellers !
0	fees are nominal and well_worth it when you put things into perspective .
0	seems a crook - free site to me !
0	ebay is a gem for hunting obscure items you thought you '_d never see again , usually a very safe_place to buy from with a tiny minority being pains !
0	vast_majority of buyers and sellers are good people with just a few trying it on .
0	always pay via_paypal for additional security .
0	ordered from robinsons many_times , great service , great products - perfect retailer
0	easy to order ,
0	ecco_shoes are very comfortable and modern_design .
0	i wish i bought earlier .

0	hi , i recently came_across a driving lesson package for my partner for £_00 . 00 i thought wow bargain .
0	i continued to check the small_print which all seemed to pan out .
0	however when i came to book the lessons which stated " 00_hours tuition driving test and pass plus " the gentleman explained that i would have to book at_least another 00_hours of lessons on top of this at £_00 per hour .
0	i was furious as like most people that book deals like this don_'_t expect to have more money on top of your original payment to pay ....
0	in light of this i contacted " groupon " to be told that i had misread the fine print and because it was longer_than seven_days after i purchased the voucher i wasn_'_t entitled to a refund and they could only give me credits ....
0	i was furious ... why would i want credits i haven_'_t used the voucher it does not expire until december_0000 and it was utterly misleading and disappointing this company should not be allowed to get away with matters like this and i will be taking further_action .
0	i payed with cash so i should be given a cash refund .
0	avoid .
0	regards sarah
0	i have used uni_baggage a few_times_now , and have found it a very very useful service .
0	uni_baggage allows you to pack more than you could ever bring on an airplane , and allows for a hassle_free journey without dragging bags around !
0	they were extremely reliable and on time .
0	my bags always arrived when they were supposed to and in perfect_condition !
0	would recommend to anyone !
0	i used several websites ( hostels . com , hostelworld . com , hotels . com ) when looking at hostels for my trip .
0	i found hostelbookers . com to be on of the easiest to use with lots of info and helpful reviews .
0	the only_thing i would like added is more information on where the hostels are located .
0	hostels . com has a good feature where it tells you how far each_hostel is from the city_centre that i think would be helpful to see on hostelbookers . com as well .
0	i ordered an ipod_touch for my 00yr_old .
0	he didn_'_t have enough birthday money for a new one and was really disappointed when he thought he would have to wait_til xmas .
0	i found the link for studentcomputers on moneysavingexpert and it had really good feedback so we went_ahead and ordered a b + ipod_touch on the tuesday .
0	it arrived on the friday and it was practically perfect , the tiniest of surface scratches on the screen which would have gone unnoticed if i wasn_'_t looking for the fault that made it a b +!
0	!
0	we will_definately be back !
0	thank_you !
0	just to say thank_you for your amazing telephone customer service :)
0	from the start the service from this website was just brilliant .
0	i ordered a sonos play : 0 zoneplayer at 0pm and received the item the next_morning .
0	i was also updated_via_email with evey_step of the order .
0	i also have a very nice follow_up phone_call making_sure everything was ok with my order .
0	thank_you :)
0	exceptional customer service ..!
0	!
0	mr john joy is a great personality who always goes that extra_mile to help me in finding the right ticket and of course the right pricing .
0	john is very patient and had always listened to what i have to say .
0	it ’_s been an_absolute_pleasure working with jon and i must have used john ’_s service for about 00 times by now and every time i get outstanding customer service from mr joy .

0	hostelbookers allows you to do a quick reservation with no unnecessary hustle .
0	it has great search tools to find that perfect accommodation of yours .
0	map_view , organising by price , room type .
0	quick and easy .
0	you ' re provided with all important details how to get there , what to expect , check in / check out timing , rules .
0	i '_ve_used the website for all my travels and i fully recommend it .
0	hostelbookers has_been my website of choice for the last couple years because they organize and rate the hostels so well , without adding a booking_fee .
0	course is interesting , and if something brakes there is always someone to help and fix the problem .
0	really easy to follow website and great understandable emails once ' order ' has_been placed .
0	really easy to order online and the photo was a good representation of the flowers that were received .
0	excellent service & loved the fact we were kept_informed when the flowers were sent out and when they had been received .
0	would recommend and use again !
0	i have two phones , one with three and another one with o0 , its amazing the difference_between one and the other .
0	o0 customer service is simple , easy and things are done pretty fast , in the other hand , three website is useless , their customer service even more useless and their policies are ridiculous .
0	i am a pay as you go customer , and never loved 0 anyways , but now i have it more then any other operator
0	trying to get my phone '_s internet unblocked through my handset , as they classify even an art website as adult content , with no success tried online , through my three account , also with no success , i then tried_phoning them , after talking to an indian assistant that i could barely understand , and give all my details from bank_account , address , drivers_license etc , to be asked to wait up to 0 hours for a text_message_confirming that they had my details checked .
0	after waiting over an_hour for the text , i got a text saying that they couldn_'_t have my age checked therefore they were unable to provide me with my adult content pin_number .
0	and i just want to watch a normal film
0	wtf ...... not impressed , in fact really disappointed
0	three is the worse mobile network in the uk
0	i hope they bankrupt and get out of business
0	i have used the software to unzip , worked well .
0	i had a bit of a problem with the download as something_else came with it .
0	i quickly removed it .
0	last night i downloaded some software .
0	got my browser highjacked by malware .
0	took me 0 hours to remove it .
0	i will never use them again .
0	there was no click or unclick box to let_me know a bundle to software was going to be loaded .
0	i have previously been very happy with the downloads .
0	what has happened to their standards ?
0	this was the 0_star_review , which is now downgraded to 0_star , see far below .
0	i '_ve_used asda home delivery for groceries on and off since their days of the telephone order service ( with the lovely gentlemen from the north_east of england taking the orders ).
0	i use asda , now via a laptop , every couple of months .
0	the delivery has normally been within the 0 hour_slot .
0	occasionally early , but they have phoned first to check i was in .
0	the quality of the groceries have been fine .
0	the occasional substitution , but normally fine .
0	although i have to say asda do get the prize for the most weird substitution , ordered - a packet of cigarettes , delivered - a plastic picnic set for one .
0	the only similarity , they were both blue .
0	i just had to laugh .
0	the substitution was the healthy option !
0	!
0	recently for the first time for years i '_ve had need to phone their customer service over a missing item .
0	they are no_longer the lovely northern gentlemen , they are obviously not located in the uk , seem to be really friendly , if a touch over chatty at 00pm at night .
0	they have promptly dealt_with my enquiry and refund produced in a few_days .
0	i will_continue to use asda for groceries from time to time .
0	i will also use tesco and sainsbury for my online groceries .
0	for me the service from these 0 suppliers are about the same .
0	just depends on what i need to order as to which one i use .
0	update to asda review - it is now months after my original review .
0	i have now had to stop using them completely as their website is now not compatible with firefox .
0	i have emailed a couple of times and all i get is change to ie ( which kept freezing for me , so i gave up with it ) or change to google_chrome .
0	as i '_m very happy with firefox i have given up with asda .
0	i shall go back and check their site every few_months to see if they have sorted the problems , but until then my £_00 per week will go elsewhere .
0	such a good selection of products , reasonable_prices and quick delivery
0	good value , delivery as promised .
0	we ordered the bath and sink_taps with the help of the clear photos on their website .
0	the bathrooms0u price was by far the best we '_d found .
0	we ordered the taps and they arrived within 0_days - in perfect_condition and well_packaged .
0	the whole_transaction was easy and organised .
0	excellent !
0	had 0 htc now - desire g0 & sensation xe brilliant phones !
0	everyone i know who has had an iphone has had nothing but trouble ... however my last 0 0 / 0 years has_been trouble free internet browsing texting and calling !
0	would not recommended any other make on the market at the moment as these_guys have it spot_on - easy to use , powerful , long_lasting , fault free and great looks !
0	excellent
0	had loads of problems with my box sky is very unhelpful .
0	repeat the same programs far too often and even_tho there are hundreds of channels there is often nothing to watch
0	can '_t fault mazuma_mobile i have an account which i have used to sell several phone .
0	their service is 0 ***** and when you send a phone off you generally have the money paid by faster payment the day they receive it .
0	( mine was next_day )
0	all invoices and packaging labels can now be printed_off line so no waiting for envelopes to be sent through the post .
0	will_definately be selling my next phone to them when it is time to up grade !
0	keep_up the good work x_x_x
0	i placed the order 0 minuted after 0pm and was told the order would processed the next working day .
0	come to find out the items i ordered were not in stock .
0	i called customer service twice both_times the agent tried to cancel my order .
0	i wonder_how they make any money if the customer service agents simply cancel orders to make problems go away .
0	i finally told her all i wanted to find out if the items could be delivered sooner .
0	she called em back after 00_minutes and confirmed that they indeed had the times in stock and that they would be dispatched the next_day .
0	the chap hadn_'_t just fitted my tyres but had educated me on the general care of them .
0	my tyres were shocking to say the least .
0	excellent value .
0	superb service .
0	and there was no_messing_around .
0	the driver had kept me really well informed about his whereabouts so i could plan my morning .
0	he turned_up exactly when he said .
0	i couldn_'_t feel happier ( and thankfully safer in my car .)
0	i would recommend these_guys , and when the time comes again i '_ll be going back to them for the next set of tyres .
0	thanks to pete and van betty .
0	after my first purchase from hq_hair all i can say is that i '_m back reviewing items to see what i can purchase next .
0	delivery did not take long , the product was nicely_packed so i have no_worries_about future buys getting damaged , product was of excellent quality ... so i can say that they company deserves the 0_stars i am rating it .
0	we '_ve just returned from a hen_weekend in liverpool and while the weekend was fab the week leading up to it was fairly stressful !!
0	i work full time and had decided that booking via chilli_sauce would make things fairly easy and hassle_free for me as the weekend organiser .
0	however , cracks started to appear the week before we went when a member of the group called the hotel to make an enquiry , only to be told that they didn_'_t have our booking !
0	needless to say this was more than concerning so when i decided to call the spa to make_sure they had our booking , surprise_surprise , they didn_'_t either !
0	after emailing vanessa ( our " manager ") she assured me that everything was booked and when we did arrive on friday , thankfully there were no_problems .
0	the spa however were calling me all day friday to make_sure we definitely wanted our appointment for the following_day ( as i later found out that vanessa had called them on the friday_morning to cancel our appointments - even_though i had asked her to do anything of the sort )!
0	long_story_short , chilli_sauce are great for the online payment system and we did feel that we got great value for money with everything that was included in our " package " but for peace of mind ask for someone a little more competent to manage your booking !
0	came_across truffle_shuffle using google as i wanted a harry_potter t - shirt to wear to the wb studio tour , london .
0	found exactly_what i wanted , easy to understand sizing and in my opinion are very accurate .
0	placed my order and it arrived in 0days .
0	couldn_'_t ask for more .
0	they were brilliant .
0	couldn_'_t have asked for better .
0	communication_throughout and they were really quick to dispatch and deliver my order and it was free_postage !
0	order came and looked even better_than i thought and gift_wrapped as well for no extra_cost .
0	what '_s even better was because of a sale i got the item marked down to lower_than the original item i was going to buy and this bracelet makes an even better christmas_present .
0	would definitely shop on argento again :)
0	i was really pleased with my order .
0	i was notified at all_stages what was going on with the status of my order and it came promptly and as_described .
0	would definitely order from this website again .
0	bought lacoste men and women gift_sets , well_packaged and presented .
0	arrived very quickly , good cost , and very easy - to - use website .
0	a ++++
0	booked two tickets to see paris st germain vs rennes for the 0th_may .
0	game was rescheduled for 0th_may but unable to get refund for tickets - take_note people !
0	i am having to try resell them online with no guarantee of a sale !
0	have made numerous_attempts to contact viagogo but receive nothing but generic responses which are of no use to me .
0	unable to list category 0 seat_numbers for the game - supposedly a psg restriction - however , loads of other_sellers ( of category 0 area ) are able to list their seat_numbers and when i first bought them i was able to see what seats i was buying !
0	such a con of a website and a copout response from viagogo - never again will i use them .
0	000euros possibly down the drain !
0	poor poor poor - your customer service stinks !
0	it quick and easy to sell your phone with mazuma .
0	i sold both of my phones and was happy with service .
0	after a slight_delay we received our furniture today & it was well_worth the wait .
0	we '_d got great service from the salesman in the leeds store & he was always available to contact if we had any_queries .
0	when we found out there was a delay on our delivery he quickly found out what the problem was & while we were a little disappointed at having to wait longer we were grateful for his honesty & the fact that the delay was due to them wanting to make_sure everything was 000_% perfect . everything arrived today & we are so pleased with it .
0	all the pieces were extremely well_packaged , which put a previous delivery from another oak company to shame !
0	there were 0 big pieces & a tv_cabinet which the delivery drivers had to get up a flight of stairs as we live in a town house but they didn_'_t complain !!
0	fantastic furniture at a really good price with good customer service from the leeds store , highly_recommended .
0	i decided to buy from solid_oak warehouse after_seeing the great pieces a friend had bought with no_problems .
0	i was worried after_reading some of the negative_feedback so we travelled down to the showroom & was impressed with the furniture & had excellent customer service .
0	we bought a dining_set which was just what we were looking for but a lot_cheaper_than other_places we '_d looked .
0	we were told it '_d be delivered in 0 - 0_weeks but in just over 0_weeks it was delivered .
0	it is fantastic & great quality .
0	all in all we had a good experience & would recommend this company to others .
0	well , what can i say apart_from wow !!
0	with statements from the bride to be to the tune of " i '_ve just had the best weekend of my life " it doesn_'_t get much_better .....
0	i wish i could take full credit but none of this would have been possible without clare .
0	clare has_been absolutely superb and patient with me throughout the whole_process ...... understood about last_minute changes and answered all of my questions and queries whether by phone or email in a quick and efficient manner ( i '_m_sure she must have been tired of hearing my voice by the end as there was a few !)
0	hats_off to clare and the rest of the team at my big_fat brighton_weekend you are superb , i just need an excuse to use you guys again !!!
0	x
0	i really was massively impressed with this whole weekend !
0	went to edinburgh and did the pub crawl treasure_hunt !
0	the accomodation was perfect and the treasure was challenging , fun , but achievable !
0	would definitely recommend this to any future hen / stag_do '_s !
0	it all pretty_much gets done for you and the website is incredibly easy to follow !
0	thanks chillisauce !
0	:_o_)
0	funky_rabbit has_been a very welcome_addition to devizes .
0	we '_ve bought a number of different shoes from there for the kids and always been happy - it '_s nice to have a range of different_styles available in the centre other than the usual clarks options .
0	the service is fantastic and very friendly .
0	the creative / play_area upstairs is a fab idea , we '_ve been to a lot of the sessions held there and the kids_love them , plus it '_s great even for a normal play / craft time plus coffee for mum ( and now cakes !
0	).
0	great to keep the independent shop spirit alive in devizes ... we '_ll keep supporting you guys !
0	do not use this company !
0	!
0	i ordered almost £ 0000 of furniture .
0	i got £ 0000 finance and paid the rest with cash on the day of order .
0	it was delivered broken .
0	it should never have left the depot given it was walking out of the boxes it was " packed " in .
0	instead , they '_d taped up a corner or two of the very badly_damaged boxes and shipped out regardless .
0	i refused the delivery and sent photographic_evidence .
0	i had to chase them for my refund .
0	when it was agreed i was told it had just been processed and i would get my money in 0 - 0 working_days .
0	it '_s now been 0 working_days and they still have my money .
0	i '_ve been told i now have to wait another 0 working_days .
0	this company doesn_'_t in any way approach professionalism .
0	they have absolutely no interest in making the customer happy or delivering anything_remotely approaching quality .
0	bought rayban , the item arrived in good packaging , looks authentic , and fast delivery .
0	finding a hostel with the best rating , most relevant location and cheapest solution was very easy .
0	although it took me more than 0 hours comparing between hotels , hostelworld , agoda , trip_advisor , in the end i still come_back and book through hostelbookers .
0	which is a breeze .
0	very happy and look_forward to my trip .
0	the reviews people left for the hostel really helped a lot .
0	although i think the owner of the hostel could have put up more photos for detail description of the room .
0	great service , fast and clear help .
0	recommended .
0	very useful idea and better then payday_loans , ideal if you have poor credit like me and cant get an_overdraft with the bank .
0	customer service is really good too .
0	english_speaking staff who are very polite and helpful .
0	still_haven_'_t received order .
0	i have contacted you but apparently i have to wait_until wednesday next week .
0	i have now completely ran_out of both products and i '_m not happy with the service .
0	easy process , super_fast delivery and great communication .
0	i have used this site about 0 times_now and will definitely be using it again .
0	i ordered a car_seat from kiddisave and was worried after_reading bad_reviews .
0	i ordered it monday_night , it arrived thursday_morning .
0	i got an_email wednesday telling_me it would be delivered thursday and on the morning of delivery got and email_telling_me a time .
0	great service , i would use them again .
0	i emailed them on the tuesday asking if the product was in stock as i had read bad_reviews and they emailed me back within half an_hour .
0	can '_t fault the service whatsoever .
0	great service and quick delivery .
0	very pleased .
0	fantastic service , will definitely use base . com again
0	competitive_prices , good product range and great service .
0	i love all the ranges argento stocks online and in store .
0	fantastic service and quick home delivery .
0	mary was a star helping_me with the access to my account .
0	super quick !
0	this website has great prices on their prework out supplements .
0	also great freebies !
0	website was easy to use and received tickets within 0_days of ordering .
0	from the beginning to end hen_heaven were on the ball !!
0	we had an excellent weekend in lovely apartments and the cocktail experience was fantastic !
0	the value for money was also unbeatable !!
0	would highly_recommend !
0	!
0	brilliant quality blinds for a very good price
0	my order arrived very quickly ... not been using the tablets long enough to know how well they work for me , but also recieved a free drink shakey and a six - blister sample_pack of another product foc !
0	no_problems here and so far a very impressed customer .
0	i had my reservations_about getting my lenses replaced / reglazed by an online company but i needn_'_t have worried .
0	the lady i spoke to on the phone was friendly and helpful , i got my prescription updated on my glasses quickly for a very reasonable_price and my glasses were even tightened when i got them back .
0	a very happy customer !
0	would definately recommend , and will probably use again in the future .
0	how a " company " with such horrendous customer service and poor operation management is still afloat / still wins contracts from big_names / has still not been shut_down or at very least had its internal processes reviewed in this day and age is beyond me .
0	found a failed delivery card left in the morning - was in all morning with the door within earshot , no knock or sign of attempted delivery apart_from the failed delivery card .
0	fair_enough , perhaps i '_d gone temporarily deaf .
0	on trying to reschedule delivery / pick - up from depot with the reference_number on their card as advised , was told numerous_times by their website and their phone line that the reference_number was not recognised .
0	bare in mind i tried this various different times throughtout the day on the day of failed delivery and the following_day just_incase theyre system hadnt been updated yet .
0	no telephone_number to actually speak to someone on hdnl website apart_from the useless rescheduling line , though fortunately i managed to get_hold of two different depot numbers from some nice people on the web for my nearest_depot .
0	but noone actually answers either of the phonelines for the depot .
0	so , i contact office ( who i ordered from ) they eventually ( 0 working_days_later ) let_me know that theyve asked the courier to redeliver , though with no eta
0	day 0 ( day i was informed id have a redelivery ) - no parcel .
0	fair_enough .
0	day 0 - no parcel
0	day 0 - no parcel
0	day 0 - thats today ..... still no parcel
0	i just want my order !
0	delivery or pick_up i dont care i just want it !!!!
0	!
0	also note : unlike so many other people on this site , i have actually once received an order from hdnl , however this was only after a failed delivery and i picked_up from my local_depot .
0	okay the failed delivery wasnt their fault that time and they did leave a valid referenced card - well_done .
0	however when i went to collect my parcel , i did get it , but the norwich depot was an_absolute state , parcels piled / toppling everywhere looked horrendously disorganised ... i thought not alot of it at the time as they did actually find my parcel , but perhaps the shockingly kept depot was just scatching the surface on a truely catastrophically run sham of an organisation .
0	steer_clear at all costs - poor communication with customers , poor organisation and poor service .
0	they make me hate internet_shopping and thats saying something because internet_shopping is like crack to me !
0	easy to use website
0	great mobile tyre_fitting service , quicker then having to go the local kwik_fit and having to wait .
0	the mobile fitter was very professional and informative , i had first purchased the wrong_size tyres , in which the fitter informed me and later came back with the right set and quickly changed the tyres .
0	found the service extremely_helpful and useful when having it all done in the comfort of my own_home .
0	would definitely purchase from kwik_fit again .
0	my boyfriend and i have used feelgoodlenses for some time now , and we '_ve never been disappointed .
0	they ' re quick , efficient and prices are usually unbeatable , on the lenses we both wear .
0	i '_ve had the unfortunate experience of having several parcels come ( or not !)
0	by yodel .
0	at our previous address , they delivered one parcel to an address that wasn_'_t mine ( wasn_'_t even in the same county ).
0	they also kept a parcel for over a month , taking it out for delivery every other day but never actually delivering .
0	i called and called about that one , and despite multiple notes , i had to cancel the order with the company so that they could recall the parcel .
0	there was another order with lots of chasing .
0	it was finally delivered , only because i happened to look out the window as the van was driving by .
0	if i hadn_'_t , i don_'_t think he '_d have stopped .
0	in short , they ' re the worst delivery company that i '_ve ever_experienced .
0	waiting on a parcel that they ' re meant to deliver at the moment and honestly not expecting to see it anytime_soon .
0	hostel_bookers really helped_me to find good , comfortable and cheap accommodation in different places in europe .
0	england , germany , france , ireland , netherlands , italy , swiss ...
0	i always come here when i need a place to stay , and their review on each_hostel is very trustworthy .
0	i ordered a pair of oakley_sunglasses that displayed they were in stock .
0	had an_email an_hour after making the purchase to say they were out of stock and their delivery for them to be back in stock was 0 - 00 days away .
0	however after 0_weeks i still had no sunglasses delivered to me .
0	i had emailed and phoned a couple times .
0	they responded to my emails quickly which was the only good thing .
0	but they were very vague on the delivery time therefore i cancelled my order and had the money refunded to me that day .
0	couldnt be without sky + makes watching_tv even better .
0	find every thing you could ever want in one place at great prices .
0	love their own_brand range just as good as big brands but better for your pocket .
0	so easy to find people , even someone you havent_seen in years is there somewhere .
0	find out any thing and everything you ever wanted to know but never knew who ask .
0	easy to use safe a simple service for buyers and sellers alike .
0	easy way to pay online and completley safe .
0	easy to use website and very helpful .
0	the engineer arrived promptly at 0 . 00 am , assessed the work and according to him would nip out to get some tools .
0	he did not return on - site until 00 . 00 am , that is at_least 0 hours and 00_minutes later !
0	when he returned , i asked if his office / workshop was far away and he replied it was just down the road .
0	the actual job ( moving the door entry phone to the other room ) was done in under 00_minutes .
0	i have been charged 000_gbp for a job that should have cost gbp 000 due to the time he disappeared off - site .
0	i have flagged this with aspects customer service last december but have yet to hear back from them after this initial reply :

0	dear hester ,
0	firstly please_accept my sincerest apologies on behalf of aspect . co . uk that your experience was anything other than the highest_level of service we aim to deliver .
0	unfortunately due to the nature of our business we can sometimes be delayed and miss or be late for an_appointment , however out of over 00 000 jobs a year that we carry out , this happens with less_than 0 %.
0	i have asked our electrical trade head to have a look at your job and get back to me as soon as possible .
0	if the engineer had to go and source parts for the job then he should have explained this to you at the time .
0	we do consider ourselves to be professional , honest and committed ; traits which are generally not associated with the industry we represent .
0	again i am sorry you feel so strongly about your aspect experience .
0	we do pride ourselves on providing excellent customer service and , although we are by no means perfect and we will look into the problem and get back to you .
0	may we take this opportunity to wish you a very happy new year .
0	kind_regards

0	....... a nice email , however since i have had no response to any of my follow_up emails or calls .
0	i can understand that they would need to make the necessary_checks with this engineer as to ascertain what would have taken him 0 hours , but their inability to keep me updated has made me doubt aspect '_s level of responsibility and clarity on what is chargeable to the customer .
0	please_beware .
0	i had a problem with setting the time on my handset .
0	after_contacting telappliant ( our supplier ), the technician took me through the solution step - by - step .
0	following his suggestions i sorted the problem easily .
0	i also received a follow - up email from telappliant to check if the problem was solved - this also proves the great customer service offered by telappliant
0	well , my experience was positive ..
0	i received my product on time and was wrapped in bubble_wrap and in a package that seemed to be durable and recycled , .. everything went well !!
0	!
0	my husband bought me an eternity_ring for christmas and it '_s stunning .
0	i emailed purely_diamonds a couple of times in the hope of it being delivered before christmas and they were very helpful and i did receive it the week before christmas .
0	the packaging was lovely and made it feel very special .
0	i would definitely recommend purely_diamonds to others .
0	thank_you for a gorgeous ring !
0	great fast service , quality products excellent range of products and delivered quickly with a smile .
0	easy to use website , offering excellent quality products at very reasonable_prices ( especially when compared to some of their_competitors who were trying to charge 0 times the cost for the guillotine i ordered ).
0	ordering was smooth and simple , and the goods arrived the next_day .
0	very impressed indeed and would not_hesitate to recommend them .
0	i purchased the longchapman handbag sets on wowcher roughly about a month_ago now and i still have not received my purchased items .
0	not only did they take my money the company initially partnered with wowcher on the deal also took my money on delivery costs .
0	it '_s been a week now since i '_ve contacted wowcher and the initial company they done the deal with , and i have not received a reply from either of them .
0	i am so disappointed and upset .
0	i would rather have my money back then actually receive the products .
0	i '_m so disappointed .
0	i advice all those who i reading this to save your money and look for deals elsewhere
0	how is it that they can take your money for a month and not delivery what you paid for ?
0	absolutely poor customer service !
0	where is my money ????
0	?
0	i '_ve been with tmobile for years_now and had several contracts .
0	i was mugged last month and called the same night to inform them , block the phone and sim and ask for a new sim .
0	made a complaint as the woman i spoke to was completely uncaring and blunt with me .

0	now taken it to the ombudsman because they won_'_t do anything more .
0	no apology , they just don_'_t care .
0	never been more angry with a company .
0	i brought a digital version of modern warfare 0 .

0	the items were all as_described , my only problem is once you shop_here you '_ll want to spend more money !
0	i had problems paying with my card online ( still not sure why ), so phoned up to book everything .
0	the salesperson was very helpful , clear , and polite .
0	everything worked out as planned .
0	all of my questions were answered in the pack that i was emailed .
0	it was really useful to be able search under different criteria such as voltage , wattage , size , and style .

0	i sent my phone off using special delivery and the next_morning the £_00 was in my bank ready to spend !
0	i '_d definitely recommend mazuma .
0	i have used wowcher in the past and had no_issues , however it seems when there is a hitch that they just don_'_t get back to you .
0	i ordered a blender on the 00th_august which went through the wowcher automatic sending page ( where they deal with the selling company on your behalf ), but have had no contact since .
0	i really dont like the ' sit back and wait ' strategy as i have no idea if it was ever sent or if the seller even received my order .
0	i have sent two emails to the wowcher enquiries email address given on the website and neither have been replied to , and i cant phone until saturday as i work the same hours as the helplines are open .
0	i '_m seriously dissappointed with the service here - i understand that hitches happen , but the lack of contact and resolution has left me never wanting to use this website again
0	no_messing_about , very friendly great service , happy customer .

0	!
0	i have been using parcel0go for quite sometime_now , i have never had any_issues with them they have always collected and delivered my parcels as promised .
0	the customer service has always been fantastic , especially today when i dealt_with daniel .
0	i had a couple of changes to make to some deliveries and he was extremely_helpful and dealt_with my request quickly and efficiently .
0	couldn_'_t recommend these_guys enough , if you need anything sent out these are the people to use .
0	remove the background provides an awesome service at the lowest_price i '_ve ever_seen .
0	they are very responsive to emails and complete projects within 00_hours .
0	i am listing my products through amazon and am was very eager to begin sales when i found out my pictures were all the wrong_size .
0	the contact at amazon recommended remove the background to me and it was a great experience !
0	i will definitely be using rtb again in the future !
0	i am going to review this company as objectively as i can considering what they have put me through .
0	i found lightinthebox through an advertisement on a well_known auction_site so i assumed that they were reliable .
0	after browsing their website i found some items that i liked .
0	if you contact the livechat the operator will give you with a $ 0 ( or £ 0 . 00 ) money off code when you spend over_$_00 .
0	unfortunately as soon as you spend over_$_00 or equivalent in gbp ( i am an english customer ) the website automatically takes away the option for the cheapest delivery , so the extra you pay for shipping , you do not save anything , it actually costs you more .
0	after bringing this issue up with the operator she told me that most people don_'_t use the cheapest option anyway as it is very slow so after a lot of debate i went with the code and paid more for the 0 - 0 day shipping instead of forgoing the code and choosing the cheaper option .
0	all of my items were under a ( ships in 00 hour ) status which they guarantee on the website but the processing time was actually 0 business days .
0	i have purchased from china before and i do always expect a long shipping time , from purchase to receiving my item was over two_weeks ( in business days ) this was fine but it is slightly_annoying that the company make promises they do not fulfil .
0	anyway , i was looking_forward to receiving my items .
0	most of them were competitively_priced with the uk market as you would expect , one of the items was expensive though (£_00 . 00 for some nail_varnishes ) so my total order was £_00 . 00 for five items .
0	the shipping amount i paid was £_00 . 00 which was good as it was coming from china but the items were very light .
0	in total i paid lightinthebox £_00 . 00 .
0	the items were not sent through national post they were sent through a courier service , i assume because they were expedited through their 0 - 0 day shipping option ( but the cheaper shipping wasn_'_t an option as my order was worth over_$_00 ).
0	this meant that the package was received and dealt_with by parcelforce and not delivered by royal_mail ( all of the items i '_ve purchased from china arrive through royal_mail .)
0	my items were not delivered to me .
0	i instead received a letter from parcelforce stating that i was required to pay £_00 before they release my package .
0	£_00 as a handling_fee over_£_00 in import_tax .
0	as i had already waited over 0_weeks to receive my package and was wary of refusing the package i had to pay this ridiculous_amount to get my goods .
0	i am aware that i am required to pay import_tax , this is calculated on the value of the items and the shipping .
0	however , the import_tax was over double than what i was required to pay .
0	the reason for this is because lightinthebox had written the value of shipping as 000 yuan which is over_£_00 !
0	which made my total order amount appear to be £_00 when it was £_00 . 00 as stated on my invoice .
0	after a very lengthy phone_call to parceforce i was told it was an issue for hmrc , cue another long phone_call to hmrc where i was told i would have to go through the process of claiming my money back through them and a lot of agro .
0	when i finally received my package , i opened it to find an exposed make shift craft knife laying at the bottom of the box ( nice and dangerous !)
0	presumably whoever was packaging my items dropped it in the box .
0	i thought purchasing from this website would be reliable and yes i have received my items but it has cost me over_£_00 for items that are worth £_00 ( and that '_s being generous ) at uk value , i do feel completely ripped_off .
0	if you feel that you are getting a bargain for items that you have not seen in the uk , think again shopping with this company will most_likely cost you twice as much than you would pay for the items in the uk and they will do nothing to help you rectify the situation .
0	a complete_nightmare experience , i will chalk it down to a learning_curve and never again will i use this company or recommend anyone_else to it , nothing short of criminal .
0	have always had positive_experiences with purchasing from amazon .
0	when i have had to contact customer_care , they have been very helpful and swift in rectifying my issues .
0	would highly_recommend to anyone .
0	i have been shopping with play since day one when they first started .
0	have always had fantastic customer service ( have only needed to send back 0 items since 0000 ) with very swift responses .
0	products are priced great .
0	delivery is nearly always within 0_days of ordering the product .
0	obviously at crimbo or other busy_periods or when weather is dodgy with snow then delays are inevitable but not the companies fault .
0	love this site and always go to for great gift_ideas too !
0	bought a 00 seater garden set at a reasonable_price .
0	they delivered when they said they would and the furniture is great !
0	great customer service , would definitely use again
0	sent phone and had an e_- mail the following_morning to say it had been checked and i would be credited with the money they quoted .
0	really fast service - no_hassle at all .
0	would definitely recommend ,
0	the lack of intervention from ebay is very frustrating when things go_wrong .
0	when it goes well it is average .
0	ordered an oven .
0	paid_extra for fitting .
0	fitters didn_'_t cut a ventilation hole and the oven overheated and burned the control_panel off .
0	contacted currys many_times by email , letter , phone and in store and this was never resolved .
0	don_'_t trust these people .
0	don_'_t reward them with your business .
0	prices are are well and reliable_source ,
0	the service was fast and the food was really fresh and in lovely containers .
0	the taste was perfect .
0	this will be the only chinese restaurant that i will be ordering from now on .
0	well_done and excellent service .
0	i would recommend that perfume to other people as it has a beautiful fragrance .
0	i would buy another one .
0	ordered some flea_treatment for my dogs .
0	fantastic price for the brand we always but from another retailer .
0	delivery arrived within a couple of days .
0	really happy with product , price & service .
0	saw an offer on groupon & checked out the website .
0	ordered the 0 piece marie set in white .
0	room wasn_'_t ready when they initially called but were happy to deliver a few_weeks_later to suit us .
0	delivery was this week and we are over the moon .
0	we were conscious we had only viewed the furniture online but the quality is fantastic and the installation was done quickly & efficiently on the day which was booked .
0	got a call that day re some missing drawer_runners which is no problem .
0	great experience from_start to finish .
0	thank_you so much for a first_class service .
0	out baby to be will love their nursery as much as we do :-)
0	i purchased my flowers , wine and what i assumed would come with it was a box of free chocolate !
0	not only did the wine that i paid for not deliver but the chocolates didn_'_t either !
0	when i phoned up i was assured that i was going to get a refund put through for that day which i understood would take 0 to 0 working_days to come through and the girl told me that she would send out the free box of chocolates like it should have been !!
0	after phoning up for the second time last thursday i am only now getting an_email_stating i will get my refund that will take up to another 0 to 0 working_days and i am yet to see the chocolates !
0	being a student in liverpool i tried to surprise my mum back home and thanks to iflorist ruined my surprise !
0	may i add the first time i had rang iflorist querying about my purchase the girl on the phone was rude , cheeky and not very helpful at all !
0	i do not recommend to shop_here at all !
0	even the flowers that were sent out did not look like much and looked dead !
0	absolute_disgrace !
0	we used hen_heaven to help organise a hen_weekend in newcastle_upon tyne in april_0000 .
0	the whole customer service experience was fantastic , nothing was too much for them even when we needed to extend the invite / deposit phase to accommodate more people .
0	very professional and organised company and the cost per head we paid was very reasonable too !
0	we dealt_with jack chandler and a girl called beth both are a credit to hen_heaven
0	i booked with a lovely girl that made the process easy for all members and myself .
0	rochelle found the best price for us and i am very glad she did , we stayed in cardiff at the novetel this was a lovely hotel worth the money we paid .
0	the highlight of the weekend was the cocktail_making , perfect for girlies that like to have fun safe to say we all enjoyed the alcohol and got a little tiddly .
0	we also had oceana pass that was a great hit with free bubbly .
0	thanks chilli_sauce i will using you again .
0	wobble wobble , what a great , simple , fun website !
0	great work and is a must visit for all bingo lovers !!
0	!
0	at first it was good it gave_me an updated amount for phone and i accepted then got an_email_saying payment would be in by end of day and still_waiting 0days on .
0	and i keep getting emails about having 0_days before price ends they seem unorganised .
0	i have then received payment 0_days_later but got a phone same day explaining still wasnt impressed with thecwait .
0	great service , prompt delivery good quality products .
0	very happy .
0	i needed a few extra quid to pay off my bf for the last bit of my holiday ... i was working but i needed to start saving i knew about mazuma and remembered that they send free post bags etc ... i was trying to do it through another site before but i had to send it off myself this gave_me no motivation so i never bothered .
0	i logged on put up four phones ... tahts id never be able to sell on ebay or anywhere !!!
0	and i got £_00 for them all !!!
0	i was shocked it was that much !...
0	so i filled everything in on m , azuma days_later i received the bag / box posted it few_days_later received my cheque .. yeah sure i felt a bit cheap putting it into my bank but oh well it felt like free money to me !!!
0	it really is not a scam and to those who say it is .. have you even used the service ???
0	obviously not because thats not what my bank_balance says !!!
0	i will_definatly be using this service again !!
0	!
0	i am really glad i found this site !
0	great , cheap ( but not quality cheap ) product and fast shipping .
0	really easy to use , good layout , easy to sort by whatever you ' re looking for , doesn_'_t show hostels that arent available for all dates requested , overall really happy to use hostelbookers
0	i am used to buy on line and i never ever had any problem until i found smartbuyglasses uk .
0	i bought a ray_ban aviator from their website because they were the only company with the model i wanted .
0	wrong decision !!!
0	they actually sold me something that they did not have available in their stock , then days after , they sent me an_email_saying that they had " ordered " it from their supplier and it should take maximum 0_weeks .
0	never happened !
0	their costumer service kept sending me emails saying that the order had been dispatched but actually they did not had a tracking_number .
0	no one could locate where the sunglasses were .
0	after a month of no decent update or answer i had enough and requested the cancellation of the order and my refund .
0	it was about a week_ago and so far no sign of my money .
0	i sent another email to the company '_s costumer service asking when the refund will be provided and again , the unclear , non precise answers started .
0	now , they claim that their system is down and their accountant department cannot deal with the refund right now but they will , asap .
0	there is no telephone_number you can call , only one email address and that is it .
0	after_reading the other reviews i learned that this company is not a uk company .
0	apparently they are based in hong_kong !!!!
0	i am so disgusted and upset about this situation that i decided i will deal with master card directly and hopefully get my money back from them .
0	the only_thing i have to say is avoid !!!!!
0	the worst experience ever !!!!!
0	!
0	i called autoglass a little unknowingly : i had noticed a chip in my windscreen going into a crack and going through my insurance booklet called the number given for the windscreen damage hotline .
0	the lady helping_me was quick and professional , but i only found out at the end of the call i had been speaking to autoglass !
0	i thought i was calling my insurance company !
0	i had been given a time for the next_day in the afternoon , but received a call in the morning asking me if earlier would be more convenient as they had an open slot .
0	the gentleman arriving was quick and clear on the service provided , and even tried helping_me with my flat_battery ( for which the car needed to be towed later in the day ).
0	we had a nice chat and the work was done within 00_minutes .
0	and it was free as it '_s a further damage - preventing repair !
0	i couldn_'_t possibly rate them higher and would recommend them to anyone :)
0	i only used the site once , to test if the quality of printing sent digitally from my laptop would print well with this company .
0	i watched the videos and downloaded the print profiles , following the recommended steps all the way .
0	when my prints arrived , i was blown_away - i have never seen my own work printed this nicely before !
0	i love the various kinds of paper they offer , they really bring an additional dimension to the chosen images .
0	i contacted them about my insurance_policy and they didn_'_t even have me registered as their customer .
0	good website that helps you find a high_quality policy at a premium you can_afford .
0	they will search all of their providers to find our cheapest car insurance quote for you .
0	excellent service .
0	they ' re offering cheap rates for international calling to any phone , all over the world .
0	they offer the best selection of quality plaques .
0	i am very satisfied with the products i received .
0	looking around for supplements with a budget in mind is a difficult_task , but supplementwarehouse . com make it easy .
0	they have the best prices i '_ve seen in years in stores or online .
0	the vast_selection of products and readiness to beat out competitors prices and availability of supplements is outstanding and puts them more than just a head above the rest .
0	i will be pleased to recommend this site to all my friends .
0	whatever you need they have !!

0	i purchased a pair of ray_ban wayfarer on 00 / 00 /_0000 and was really pleased when i received an_email the next_day saying that my purchase had been shipped .
0	the sunglasses arrived in around 0_days which was fantastic !
0	however , even_though the website is a . co . uk website , these sunglasses have been shipped to me from hong_kong - which made me doubt my purchase straight_away .
0	when i opened the package the sunglasses were in perfect_condition and came with authenticity etc but the lense size was smaller_than i had expected .
0	at this point i wasn_'_t particularly bothered , and wanted to simply exchnage the sunglasses for the same style and colour , but just with the larger lens option .
0	so i went abck on to the website to try and find a telephone_number to contact them on .
0	no such luck .
0	there is no contact number on the whole website !
0	so i had to write an_email to thier customer service email address and hope for the best .
0	i received an_automated_response email when i sent my first query to customerservice @ smartbuyglasses . co . uk which was nice , just notifying_me that they had received my email , and would be in touch shortly .
0	now ..... 00 days after receiving this item and 00 emails later sent to customerservice @ smartbuyglasses . co . uk and servicemanager @ smartbuyglasses . co . uk i still do not have a returns merchandise number for my purchase ( en0000000000g ).
0	i find this rude , disrespectful and outright unacceptable for an online company .
0	i honestly wish i had just bought these sunglasses from a highstreet retailer , and at_least i would know where they had come from , and would have a point of call for any_queries i might have regarding the purchase - for the sake of saving £_00 !
0	i have never received such appaulingly low levels of customer service , and i will not be purchasing from your website again , and certainly will not be recommending you to anybody .
0	i don_'_t usually_write online reviews about these sort of things but your lack of communication has made me realise that you seem to respond to complaints on trustpilot . co . uk and not via your customer service email address .
0	regards
0	unhappy customer
0	this shop is amazing !
0	arrived fast , more than well_packaged !
0	a sledgehammer couldn_'_t have damaged my items !
0	i bought two_pairs of boots and they were fantastic !
0	very cheap and amazing quality .
0	thank_you joke . com !!
0	!
0	i had never ordered from , or heard of , homesupply prior to this order .
0	i ordered some bristan wall - mounted bridge mixer_taps for the utility_room and some bath overflow / waste things .
0	firstly , they had what i wanted and the prices were very competitive .
0	there seemed a wide_selection of things but i already had decided what i wanted .
0	secondly , the best bit about them as far as i was concerned was the regular email_updates which i found really helpful and re - assuring .
0	every_step of the order and dispatch process was matched with an_email to me .
0	delivery was fast .
0	i would not_hesitate in using them again .
0	beware when changing to this company haven_'_t had a bill for 0_months and they want to put my payments up think they bit off more than they can chew
0	had to get a parcel to my son in england urgently .
0	rang unibaggage , they delivered as promised .
0	have no_hesitation in recommending this company and will be using anytime i need a parcel sent .
0	good customer_care is a rare_thing these days , but 0_stars to unibaggage .
0	the item arrived within two_days of ordering and looks brilliant .
0	thank_you
0	emily
0	very trust_worthy , very safe , simply the best money processor for online payments there is .
0	the website is very helpful for different travellers .
0	it '_s nice not to pay extra and feel secure about your booking .
0	thanks :)
0	ordered flowers to be delivered on 00th_feb to my wife '_s workplace , only to find out they have just been delivered today at about 0 . 00 - over 00_hours late !
0	to make it worse , we left home yesterday for a long weekend so the flowers are sat at her work so she won_'_t see them alive !
0	plus it was also her_birthday yesterday .
0	how embarrassing , not so much for me ( i '_m just a little furious ) but certainly embarrassing for her .
0	i feel really bad but its certainly not my fault .
0	i ordered the flowers in plenty of time ( monday 00th ) and paid_extra for the before 0pm delivery .
0	i followed iflorists ticket complaint procedure but as yet , no response .
0	and cannot get through via phone .
0	iflorist - please issue a full_refund so that something can be salvaged from all this .
0	i did try to ask via your website but have been forced to ask on a public_forum as this seems the only way that encourages you to respond .
0	thanks ( i hope ) in_advance for your response .
0	found the sight really easy to use , ordered the cartridge - which was easy to find - the item was delviered next_day with no_damages or holds up .
0	excellent service .
0	i '_ve been looking for a particular product , which is hard to find in the uk .
0	not only did buyhair . co . uk have what i was looking for , they had it in more colours than_anywhere_else and for a better price .
0	the delivery was quick and the product was exactly as advertised .
0	i will definitely be using the company again .
0	convenient and easy to use , always had great experiences !
0	i bought a case for my new phone .
0	the description on the website was correct , the delivery was very quick , and the price was amazing .
0	have never seen this hostelsorderservice before , always used hostel . com and hostelworld . com .
0	unexpectedly , this hostelbooker . com showed more options , which were much more suitable .
0	fast procedure and fast reply !
0	very nice
0	first time using the online delivery service and maybe my last , estimated 00 pounds online shopping receipt was 000_pounds , 00_quid of it was for 00 tubs ( they didn_'_t deliver 00 tubs ) of ice_cream i didn_'_t even order , called customer_services and was told they '_d call tomorrow ?
0	y tomorrow ??
0	y not sort it now ?
0	then ill have to wait 0_days for money to return to my account ... come on sainsburys not good !!
0	!
0	so after receiving an_email_saying my order had been cancelled because of my payment details , which were correct and my bank_account had plenty money in it .
0	i contacted them via_twitter and facebook only to see a status posted which was basically rude saying that all messages to themselves should be dealt_with privately , i private messaged them and they ignored it for a day !
0	but when i tweeted them again , they responded within ten_minutes ?
0	lol .
0	anyway , the man i spoke to said my refund was being_processed , and this was while i was out of the house .
0	i came home that night to a delivery card saying hermes attempted delivery but would return the day after .
0	when the day after my order arrived i was fuming .
0	after dealing_with their awful customer service , i realised that them saying my refund was being_processed was a complete lie given my order was being delivered the same day i was supposedly getting my money back .
0	i '_m beyond irritated by the way i was treated and will never use your site again , and will be telling friends and family to avoid also unless they wish to be treated with complete disrespect .
0	and just to add , i didn_'_t get petty over a five_pound order , i spent over sixty pounds .
0	i wrote about this on my blog , a full rave review sharing how incredible this was .
0	my opinions on this brand where so high numerous people have already ordered products by the brand .
0	the items are of superb quality , have used them before and will definitely be using them again .
0	i ventured into one of their stores today to buy an item for my camera .
0	they were very helpful and polite and even tried the product i was after on one of their sales items so i could see exactly_what i was buying and how it fitted .
0	they didn_'_t treat it like a waste of time and couldn_'_t do enough for me .
0	it wasn_'_t even an expensive item .
0	i will use them again without_hesitation .
0	i entered my details on the website on the sunday , opted to have them send me the pack so as to send the phone back .
0	i received that on the tuesday , sent the phone back and got my email on the wednesday saying they had the phone and would send me my payment that day .
0	wanted an_instant transfer and that '_s exactly_what i got , no_quibble , just money in the bank .
0	if i '_d have known it was that easy i would have done it ages_ago instead of giving my old_phones away .
0	good price too for a phone i haven_'_t used in months .
0	wouldn_'_t have even thought about it but happened to see an advert on the box and thought " why not ".
0	deffo gonna be using this company again and i reccommend you do the same if you '_ve got a phone kicking about !!
0	!
0	i always use hostelbookers when i travel !
0	it is so simple to use and i always find the best prices .
0	i have booked probably about seven or eight times through this website and i have had a great experience every time .
0	there are many of these televised phone buying websites but following their release of an advert which is related to charlie and the chocolate factory , i knew which was the company to use !!
0	!
0	i went online and got a quote for my old_iphone and compared that to the prices people were paying on ebay , i opted for mazuma as the price was fair and it would cut out the extra costs i . e .
0	commission / listing fees on ebay .
0	i sent my phone which cost £ 0 . 00 through insured mail and received emails constantly keeping_me updated on the process and then my cheque arrived within days .
0	the service is brilliant and so very quick !
0	never at any point did this company give me any reason to doubt them !
0	highly_recommended .
0	quick speedy service .
0	would recommend using them .
0	i was delighted to discover cult_pens - the range they offer is extensive , and much_better value than any shop i '_ve found in bristol or plymouth .
0	the website is well_designed , with a range of search_functions that make it easy to find what you ' re looking for even if you don_'_t know the name of the product .
0	the delivery and service are faultless .
0	i was hesitant to order first because of the low_prices , but after_reading the reviews i decided to go_ahead with it .
0	i '_m_glad i did because the postage was fast and the product was exactly_what i ordered , can '_t complain .
0	i will definitely be using this website again .
0	i was looking for somewhere that sold ghds , i tried everywhere but i couldn_'_t find any in the shops so i tried online , the only website i could trust was this on , and because it had money off i decided to buy .
0	i couldn_'_t be_happier , they arrived the next_day as promised and they work excellently , i don_'_t know how i managed with my other straighteners , it now takes me half the time and my hair is actually straight !!
0	!
0	i ordered and the next_day it arrived .
0	a very excellent service , thank_you !
0	i had lasik intralase wavefront performed on both of my eyes in february_0000 and an enhancement , but lets call it a correction in october_0000 and have regretted that decision ever_since .
0	whilst on paper the procedure was a ' success ', as my vision has_been improved , it has now been over 00 months and i am still suffering from severe dry_eye and struggle every day as a result of this .
0	every_single day i have to deal with my eyes stinging and feeling achy and tired .
0	eye_drops have become part of my everyday_life .
0	i have also been left with eye floaters which are a daily frustration given that my work is 000_% computer_screen based , and that is when they are visible constantly .
0	i am simply being told to ignore them , but to anyone who_understands what persistent eye floaters are , you will know that is simply not a option .
0	nice bright summer days are no_longer enjoyable to me due to becoming light sensitive , i often find myself wearing sunglasses on a relatively dull day to help with the floaters and brightness sensitivity .
0	my vision fluctuates constantly and although i am told i have 00 / 00 vision , this does not mean the same as perfect vision as i was led to believe pre_- lasik .
0	often reading text comes in and out of focus , and i have lost clarity / sharpness of my vision .
0	i truly believe that within 0 year i shall be back to wearing contact_lenses .
0	i have also been left with start bursts / halos at night , which had made night time driving impossible .
0	this procedure cost me a staggering_£_0k , i may as well of thrown that money in a bin .
0	having this surgery truly has affected my life immensely as i now suffer from high anxiety and often get depressed about my situation .
0	anyone considering this procedure should really do their research as the side_effects really can ruin your life .
0	you only get one pair of eyes , appreciate them , they are precious , it '_s really not worth the risk !
0	if only i could turn back time i would walk out of that surgery room with my eyes unharmed !
0	when i was ordering my internet crashed and i didn_'_t know if the order had gone_through so i sent hifiheadphones an_email .
0	they rang me 00_minutes later to let_me know it hadn_'_t gone_through .
0	then when i managed to complete the order they sent me a personal email to confirm that this time it definitely had gone_through .
0	i thought that was excellent .
0	the item arrived very quickly , and included a free lolly .
0	small gestures are appreciated !
0	also the product is great - i have already_recommended the product and the website to 0 people .
0	i would buy off this site again .
0	my order arrived about a week after i ordered and the hair is lovely and soft .
0	the clips are all in working order , i have bought loads of clip in extensions in the past and i '_ve noticed that usually some of the clips don_'_t work .
0	but these all work .
0	i wish i ordered a extra pack though because my hair is quite thick and the extensions ( 0packs ) are still too thin at the ends .
0	but having said that i will buy again in future *****
0	i was not pleased with my order at all ... the stickers . where too small there for we are not able to use for . buisness ....
0	i am very upset and very unsatisfied with my order ...
0	online courses made easy .
0	available 00 / 0 to fit into any schedule .
0	highly_recommended .
0	ec0000
0	i am satisfied with the system of this website . also , i found a hostel that i booked without service fee !!!
0	!
0	it is unique that i have never met !!!
0	!
0	hostelbookers is a great website , and it is cheaper_than hostel_world !
0	it is very easy to use and i believe the people leave descent reviews for everyone , so the travel experience becomes the best !
0	so thank_you hostelbookers for making my travel better and easier .
0	i have used wowcher twice .
0	both_times the deals were misleading , listing things that weren_'_t included in the price , and both experiences were disappointing .
0	recently i contacted wowcher three_times about a problem , this was over the course of a month and they never replied .
0	i have nothing good to say about wowcher , don_'_t use them .
0	brilliant from_start to finish .
0	i used this company for my last place of work and it was so easy and straight_forward to use .
0	keep_up the good work guys !
0	was put off by the website , quite tricky to make a booking .
0	unfortunately my order was not even placed with the carrier , and i am still_waiting for my refund !
0	result - no collection , no refund , wasted my time here , wont_be using again .
0	one call .... to someone_else , more like !
0	all looked good , website looked nice , parcel booked in with ease , although waiting for a collection is another story .... no show , myhermes said they would rebook when i called them , again another no show , so decided to cancel .
0	result - no collection , full_refund , wasted my time here , wont_be using again .
0	i recently did a project on comparing on - line parcel companies and here are my findings ..
0	the dodgy website should have been enough to scare me away , no parcel collection , no response to my emails , no telephone support , no support at all .
0	result - no collection , no refund , wasted my money here , wont_be using again .
0	absolutely discussing service .
0	i was let_down less_than 00 before i flew , i had to try and arrange another luxury car for my business trip .
0	they did not do anything to help or offer me and alternative .
0	i had to ring them to confirm my booking at which point i was told it was not going to be possible , at what point were they going to let_me know ?!!!!
0	never again !
0	i can recommend carhire0000 , they went out of there way to help me .
0	i use glasses_direct all the time after having it recomended to me , i found the high_street so expensive , i have only had the experiance of the reglazing service from them , and can '_t fault it at all .
0	have recommened it to all i know !
0	within my price range and stunning quality .
0	only wish i could get married twice :-)
0	delivered quicker_than_expected
0	would have absolutly no_reservations_about using again
0	also really good value for money couldn_'_t find it cheaper anyhwere else !
0	never answer the phone - didn_'_t have the stock .
0	poor .
0	i was very pleased to find the product arrived so fast .
0	was disappointed once i opened the package .
0	the casing is not dry with beads falling_off and the pink shimmering powder stained my pants and hands .
0	can '_t even use it .
0	i spent an_hour trying to book flights through this site ; every time i got to payment after entering full details for 0 passengers , the site would fail .
0	you couldn_'_t even tell if you '_d paid or not , it was so frustrating .
0	eventually i booked directly through the air line website , which was much simpler and a lot_cheaper .
0	don_'_t use opodo , it '_s a waste of your time .
0	parcel0go were very helpful , they entered all the information for me via the live_chat so i only had to pay for the delivery , i would definitely use them again .
0	i have recently_sold my house using house_network and they were fantastic .
0	they advertise on all the popular and major sites so we had lots of viewings .
0	i found a buyer under 0_weeks and the sale went through very quickly .
0	the viewings were arranged very efficiently by the team at house_network .
0	they are also very well priced not overpriced like most estate_agents .
0	i would definitely use them again and i would recommend them to everyone too !
0	worst company i have ever dealt_with ....
0	ever !!!
0	sent my phone on the 0th_june special delivery recieved by them on the 00th_june still no payment i called on friday 0th_july as i think i have given them more then enough time now to pay up , they told me the money would be in my account in the enxt 00hours .
0	waited_until monday still not recieved called back on monday to be told the money would be in my account by 0pm that night it wasnt called tuesday again told i was the next in the que to be paid and it will be in my account by 0pm still not recieved called today and demanded i speak to the manager , at 00 . 00 i was advised he will call back within 00mins - called back at 00 . 00 to be advised the manager was on his lunch and will call me at 0 ; 00 , he still hadnt called me back at 0 . 00pm so i called again id been left a message on my phone whilst i was waiting for them to call me and it was a rather blazay " sorry for the confusion " the money will be in your account by the 00th_july for 0 what confusion ?
0	and 0 00th_july 0_weeks after they recieved the phone ............. no when i got through to a advisor i was told the manager was in a meeting then that he was on the phone i advised i wasnt getting off the phone until i had spoke to the manager so to get him out of his " meeting " or off the phone_call he was on within 0mins i was speaking to the manager he blamed the slow service on technical_difficulties so i pointed_out all the review sites and reviews from a year_ago with the same kind of service - to which he told me i should take these review sites with a pinch of salt i work for appliances_online which has brilliant reviews on trust pillot so i advised this was utter_rubbish - ive demanded the money be in my account today but apparently there are a million other people in this que ...... to which i have told this manager to go and speak to the account department and fast track my payment - he is apparently calling me back tonight at 0pm - i very much doubt he will but guess_what il be calling back tommorrow !!
0	!
0	i sent my iphone0 00gb to cash for phones on 00 / 00 special delivery recieved on 00 / 00 and im still_waiting for my payment , before i realised how shockilngly sh_* t this company is i told my little sister how much i was getting for my phone and she asked if i would send her phone too ......... after_reading the reviews on cash0phones and then reading the reviews on mazuma i decided to send my sisters phone to mazuma instead , it was sent special delivery on friday 00 / 00 and the money was in my account on tuesday 00 / 00 .
0	i was updated all the way through with the process - unlike cash0phones who i have had to ring 0times and now threatened legal_action aswell as sent the managing_director a message on linkedin advising i have sent a complaint to watchdog - which i have - all to no reponse but they can send reminder letters about my sisters phone i enquired_about sending !!!!
0	!
0	really pleased with how quick and easy it was having me car serviced at fastfit !!
0	and a damn sight cheaper_than the manufacturers garage too :-_d
0	i will never use them again .
0	they failed to collect the parcel , failed to rearrange for 0_days , would not give me my money back ( even the extra i paid for next_day delivery - which clearly didn_'_t happen .)
0	on chat to customer_services for over half an_hour and still no apology .
0	awful
0	we '_ve_used hostelbookers a number of times and have found every experience to be great , from the huge choice of hostels and hotels available on their site , to the great prices , ease of booking , and fee free bookings !
0	we '_ve never had a problem with any of our bookings , with all hotels / hostels having our rooms ready on arrival and as booked !
0	we will definitely continue to use hostelbookers in our travel planning .
0	well what can i say !!
0	pretty_much the same as everyone else !!
0	ordered the bluebud 0inch tablet for a christmas_present , it has never arrived .
0	i was issued a tracking code which when you use on royal mails website says " this item cannot be tracked untill its delivered " so that helps !!
0	wowcher said maybe i could call royal_mail to let them know so they could improve their site !
0	i have called bluebud 000s of times .
0	always engaged .
0	sent emails .
0	never replied .
0	have contacted wowcher god_knows_how many_times .
0	they also never reply go calls of emails .
0	so frustrating .
0	last_week i had an_email askin me to review wowchers service and the item .
0	hahah .
0	probably not the best idea when i haven_'_t received it !
0	funny enough .
0	they didnt reply to that email within their 0 day time_scale .
0	called last_week for a refund .
0	" oh " " i shall pass this to the refunds team as they need to see if you have a valid reason for a refund ".
0	0_days they said .
0	guess_what !!
0	yes !
0	it '_s been 0 already !
0	please steer well clear of wowcher and their not so amazing a deals .
0	i '_m not sure about a wow a day .
0	i would say its about time they called it a day !
0	!
0	it may seem like a good deal on the cover .
0	but once you add up the constant phone_calls .
0	your time .
0	your patience and frustration .
0	not to mention disappointed kids at christmas .
0	please spend the extra on the high_street or reliable amazon / ebay .
0	have now taken action with the small_claims court .
0	thanks to my dad being a solicitor , its pretty easy .
0	everybody should pursue this route .
0	i always use hostelbookers and it '_s always great and so easy to use !
0	very stressful experience buying from viagogo .
0	booked tickets for lionel richie for my mams birthday on 00 . 00 . 00 and concert is tomorrow 00 . 00 . 00 and have still not received tickets or any email_confirmation that tickets are arriving which is the protcol that the website specifies is supposed to happen .
0	contacted viagogo to no_avail as they blame sellers and only act as an agent .
0	no further updates received and not kept in contact about tickets even_though when speaking to an advisor i was informed that they would look into it and call me back .
0	would not receommend to anyone .
0	not a happy experience .
0	happy with quote price and service
0	psychedelic prints and outstandingly comfortable ...
0	they get me ready for the weekend ;)
0	xxxxxxxx liz xxxxxxxxxx
0	brilliant products at competative_prices !!
0	customer_services are 0_star and i have gone back and bought more since my first purchase !
0	delivery is super quick !
0	would recommend !
0	couldn_'_t be_happier with the items i have purchased !
0	on time and great service ...
0	shipped to me on time !
0	we got the baby waker for our little_boy for christmas , when we got it we put it togerher to see how it looked and i love it so comofy , and our little man loved it as we tryed him in there to see if like it and hes smile told us he did , cant_wait for christmas to come now so he can play in there .
0	i find no other place like gaming dragons which offers latest games at such a discounted_price and that too with speedy delivery .
0	after_reading the bad_reviews on this website i tend to disagree .
0	i have now dealt_with thornton '_s twice and have had great customer service both_times .
0	i have found the staff to be very diligent and prompt with their replies on email and phone_calls .
0	congrats to the company on hiring great staff .
0	ordered flowers for mothers_day , they turned_up on time but were wilting and looked on their way out .
0	i emailed serenata and provided the photographic_evidence they required .
0	they offered me a replacement or a refund , i chose a refund which i still_haven_'_t received 0_days_later .
0	i emailed them about it last night and was told they have no record of me asking for a refund and have no copy of the emails that were sent from me .
0	awful company , don_'_t use them .
0	fuss 0 are not only reasonable in price but the staff are extremely_helpful and help beyond their call of duty .
0	fuss 0 '_s after sales is exceptional !
0	why go_anywhere_else ?
0	i have used hostel_bookers everywhere i have travelled and always found them easy to use and very clear in their instructions .
0	my favourite feature is the reviews being available to read whether negative or positive and average percentages given for every hostel .
0	i received my products quickly , well_packaged , cheaply and with a couple of freebies .
0	what more could i ask , i was very happy , thank_you very much
0	i have this escada rio perfume and it just finished and i have been looking for a good deal and i found it in cheapsmells . com .
0	never used them before , so i check the reviews out in trustpilot and most of them were good .
0	so i thought why not give a try .
0	i order an escada perfume from them .
0	service was good and fast got the perfume within 0 - 0_days .
0	but the product turned_out to be fake .
0	i called the customer service said i wanted to return the product , first they said they wont accept as i had opened the cellophane packaging and when i mentioned fake and its not similar to the one i have then they said ok send it with a letter stating the reason for you return .
0	and we shall refund it as soon as we get the product back .
0	hope they do as they say ..
0	i have only ever ordered items through other_companies but apparently you can buy things direct ?
0	i ordered a lot of things before christmas and most of it arrived without_any problem , the jewellery i ordered took quite a while and i was really disappointed with the quality , i feel some some companies are making up the retail prices .
0	i also am still fighting to get a refund for an item i have not received , it was ordered 0_weeks_ago and i thought it would be the highlight of my boyfriends christmas , but sugarush love have been slow and difficult , not to mention unapologetic !
0	i have now given up and just trying to get a refund .
0	on a positive_note your complaints team have been quick and efficient , i just think you should be more selective with who you chose to work with .
0	ordered my tumble_drier and it was delivered the next_day in perfect_condition .
0	prices are totally reasonable .
0	will recommend to anyone
0	*****
0	cancelled an order with simply_electronics on the 00th_october after_placing an order on the 00th_october and still no refund !
0	£_000 they have belonging to me all they keep doing is changing the status of my refund , yesterday it was at refund completed today it says refund queuing on the gateway and will be with you soon !!!
0	i just don_'_t understand !
0	its theft in my opinion , they shouldn_'_t be allowed to trade at all .
0	i have also contacted watch dog to report them .
0	looks like i '_ve had the same experience as most on this site .
0	i '_m taking_legal_action_against these scumbags
0	i went to sigma to buy a wetsuit on the recommendation of a friend .
0	as it was some distance to travel , i phoned up first , to get some advice on what they have on sale , logistics / parking_facilities and the guy i spoke to was really helpful .
0	i knew very little about what type of wetsuit i needed and at the store , i was given a lot of help in fitting .
0	chris , who_served me , also looked into which lakes i could go to nearby to try it out , which was great .
0	i was also really impressed with the follow - up service .
0	i had a query about the wetsuit once i got back home and chris phoned me up and sorted it all out very quickly .
0	the sigma store is too far for me to shop there regularly , but i have found the online service really good as well .
0	i purchased a swim cap online and it turned_out that there were none available .
0	however , the customer service was prompt and helpful and i was sent another ( more_expensive ) swim - cap and it was sent to me as next - day delivery , with no extra_cost , as i needed it that week .
0	i ’_m really impressed with all_aspects of the service .
0	ordered this balance_bike after lots of research .
0	it appeared to be the best one which would suit my son from the age of 00 months old .
0	the bike is very well made and should withstand a boistrous young boy !
0	the item didn_'_t arrive within the 0 working_days , however after one call to kiddisave they rang the suppliers and confirmed it would be with me by the end of the week , which it was .
0	very good service .
0	sent phone off and within a couple of days i received a cheque for the agreed payment .
0	good company ,
0	ordered a box of byker crisps as they can be quite hard to get_hold of !
0	good that you can pay by paypal , makes the transactino a lot quicker .
0	i put the wrong delivery address however , but i emailed the site and they managed to courier it to the correct_address .
0	would def use again
0	thanks for sending everything through so quickly .
0	having free delivery is also a massive perk to your service .
0	the products were all considerably_cheaper_than those in my local_shops so i '_m really impressed and will_continue to use you .
0	many_thanks
0	had a discount for hostelworld so went there first .
0	wouldn_'_t allow me to book , kept returning me to the info for the hostel and happened to my friend too .
0	wouldn_'_t let_me register .
0	looked here for the same hostel , clicked book almost_instant .
0	will use again .
0	excellent
0	i ordered a bedroom_suite ( bed , 0x bedsides and a wardrobe ) from the furniture_market having looked around for some time on the internet and the high_street .
0	i came_across the furniture_market website and was really impressed with their range of products on offer , their free delivery service and great product knowledge after_speaking to them on the phone .
0	i couldn_'_t find similar items cheaper on any other website but most_importantly , having_spoken to them on the phone , i had confidence that i was dealing_with a company that were reputable .
0	i received my items shortly the next week and the delivery drivers were more than courteous lifting the items into the house .
0	the items were well_packed and the sections of the bed and wardrobe fitted together easier than i expected .
0	great buying experience and i will be coming_back again to buy from you !
0	excellent service .
0	mazuma accepted my phone as working even_though i told them in_advance that the buttons were a bit sticky and there was some superficial damage .
0	i sent my phone recorded delivery on the tuesday , had it accepted on the wednesday and had the money in my account on the friday .
0	will_definately use this company again .
0	unprofessional shoe manager , discussing my husband and his discussion in front of other staff and other custmers , then preceeded to argue with me when i noticed .
0	needless to say i have e_mailed the ceo and will refrain from ever shopping there again .
0	only requested an exchange for my sons hat which was faulty !
0	!
0	my complaint regarding vodafone
0	in march , my galaxy_s0 stopped_working .
0	it simply would not charge .
0	although it had a cracked_screen , this had not affected the phone previously ; it had worked_perfectly for approximately 0_months .
0	i took the phone in to vodafone , parkgate , rotherham , where staff_member claire recorded the fault as “ charging_port not working ” and posted ( 0 ) it off to be fixed .
0	around a week_later , i received a text to say the phone was not in warranty , due to a cracked_screen and could be repaired at a cost of 00 . 00 ; i was asked to ring customer_services .
0	i rang and was told my phone was out of warranty , at the store and was initially sent to the repair_centre for a cracked_screen .
0	i was told to go to the store to give further instructions .
0	i spoke with claire in store again and she told me it had been sent in for the charger_port and nothing to do with the screen , so they should have fixed it .
0	i rang customer_services there and then and they said they would fix the phone , ( charger_port and crack ) for 00_% of the total charge .
0	i agreed to this .
0	off the phone went again .
0	( 0 ) another 00 days_later , i received a text to say the phone was fixed .
0	i went to the store , the screen had been fixed but not the charging_port , the assistant tried to charge it in store and it still would not charge .
0	the phone went off again ( 0 ) to the repair_centre .
0	i was fuming and rang customer_services who apologised and offered me a replacement phone , ( s0 or i phone 0 ), i opted for the s0 or even an s0 , ( but they are not made anymore ) so accepted the s0 and then went without my phone for a further 0_weeks .
0	i was in sheffield shopping with my family for the day when customer_services called me .
0	a female explained that head_office would not authorise a replacement phone as mine had not been sent back for repair three_times , ( the third time was when i was offered the replacement ) and i was to go back to the store and have it sent off again once it had eventually returned to the store .
0	we cut short our day out and returned to the store in rotherham .
0	i spoke with claire , yet again and she was in disbelief this was still going on .
0	by this point i was feeling exhausted with having to keep returning to the store , the repeat phone_calls to customer_services , where i had to explain everything over and over again .
0	frustrated , depressed and generally worn out with the whole_process , i was ready to give in and just have no phone .
0	( my son , heard this and offered me his , which was my old s0 ).
0	my husband asked his name to be added to the account so that he could deal with things from then on .
0	the staff , james and claire were doing their best to help but their hands were tied as it was up to customer_services to sort it out .
0	claire spoke with customer_services again and explained_everything ; they said it would have to be sent back again .
0	this was the fourth time .
0	the phone came back a week_later , working .
0	i thought that was the end of it .
0	a new battery had been sent to me with the phone .
0	i used the phone a few_times and the battery drained very quickly .
0	my husband went to store again and they said it was because the new software was not available yet and it would work better , when that was available .
0	i accepted this .
0	at the end of april the bill was late being paid and the phone was disconnected , we paid it and customer_services said they could not re connect my accounts as there was an outstanding bill for a repair to the phone , we explained to them what had happened and was told a manager would call me back .
0	the phone was reconnected .
0	no one called .
0	the may bill was late being paid , however , on the 00th_may , my husband paid the bill and was again told that as there was an outstanding bill for a repair , the phone would not be reconnected .
0	he requested a call back from a manager and was told the 0th_june , he was to be without a phone until then , mine however was reconnected ???
0	i rang customer_services at lunchtime and was told the same thing , yet again went through the whole story as to why there was a bill on my account for a repair .
0	the female called vivien , said that a manager was going to call me back on the 0th of june , there was nothing she could do and if the bill had been paid that morning then it will take up to 00_hours to reconnect and i had to wait for a manager to call .
0	i was confused as my phone had been re connected , so why not my husbands ?
0	i rang again that evening and explained to lavin , what had happened , he said the bill was outstanding from march and needed to be paid , i said it wasn_’_t a bill but a repair fee so he spoke to the finance_department .
0	he said he will reconnect my husbands phone there and then , ( which does not tally up with viviens claim that it takes up to 00_hrs ), the phone was reconnected .
0	i then said i wanted a call from a manager the next_day , may 00th and i wanted a text to confirm this .
0	he agreed .
0	i received no text .
0	i also received no call from the manager as promised .
0	i woke_up this morning and my phone is not working again .
0	it will not charge and has yet again been sent in for repair .
0	the manager at the store said that as it had been working it would now be classed_as a new fault , so i would not qualify for a replacement phone .
0	he advised me to e_- mail the director , which i have .
0	i cannot understand how a multi million pound company can treat a customer this way and is allowed to continue to do so .
0	i cannot understand_why the stores have no rights over how to treat the customers , i have not the time to be phoning vodafone all the time certainly not whilst i am in the store , hoping they can sort it and they cannot .
0	numerous_times i have driven to the store , numerous_calls made , numerous_times i have repeated the story , numerous_times i have been told different things , numerous_times i have been ignored and numerous_times i have lost data , phone numbers , photo ’_s of my children and my newborn niece .
0	numerous_times my days out with my children has_been ruined , an evening with my husband ruined , having to take my children into the store and be on a call for up to an_hour .
0	i have had enough now , and need advice on what i can do .
0	i cannot face another phone_call to customer_services , ( especially on a poor courtesy phone ), speaking with foreign call staff who do not understand me and i them .
0	my complaint regarding vodafone ( may 00th 0000 )
0	in march , my galaxy_s0 stopped_working .
0	it simply would not charge .
0	although it had a cracked_screen , this had not affected the phone previously ; it had worked_perfectly for approximately 0_months .
0	i took the phone in to vodafone , parkgate , rotherham , where staff_member claire recorded the fault as “ charging_port not working ” and posted ( 0 ) it off to be fixed .
0	around a week_later , i received a text to say the phone was not in warranty , due to a cracked_screen and could be repaired at a cost of 00 . 00 ; i was asked to ring customer_services .
0	i rang and was told my phone was out of warranty , at the store and was initially sent to the repair_centre for a cracked_screen .
0	i was told to go to the store to give further instructions .
0	i spoke with claire in store again and she told me it had been sent in for the charger_port and nothing to do with the screen , so they should have fixed it .
0	i rang customer_services there and then and they said they would fix the phone , ( charger_port and crack ) for 00_% of the total charge .
0	i agreed to this .
0	off the phone went again .
0	( 0 ) another 00 days_later , i received a text to say the phone was fixed .
0	i went to the store , the screen had been fixed but not the charging_port , the assistant tried to charge it in store and it still would not charge .
0	the phone went off again ( 0 ) to the repair_centre .
0	i was fuming and rang customer_services who apologised and offered me a replacement phone , ( s0 or i phone 0 ), i opted for the s0 or even an s0 , ( but they are not made anymore ) so accepted the s0 and then went without my phone for a further 0_weeks .
0	i was in sheffield shopping with my family for the day when customer_services called me .
0	a female explained that head_office would not authorise a replacement phone as mine had not been sent back for repair three_times , ( the third time was when i was offered the replacement ) and i was to go back to the store and have it sent off again once it had eventually returned to the store .
0	we cut short our day out and returned to the store in rotherham .
0	i spoke with claire , yet again and she was in disbelief this was still going on .
0	by this point i was feeling exhausted with having to keep returning to the store , the repeat phone_calls to customer_services , where i had to explain everything over and over again .
0	frustrated , depressed and generally worn out with the whole_process , i was ready to give in and just have no phone .
0	( my son , heard this and offered me his , which was my old s0 ).
0	my husband asked his name to be added to the account so that he could deal with things from then on .
0	the staff , james and claire were doing their best to help but their hands were tied as it was up to customer_services to sort it out .
0	claire spoke with customer_services again and explained_everything ; they said it would have to be sent back again .
0	this was the fourth time .
0	the phone came back a week_later , working .
0	i thought that was the end of it .
0	a new battery had been sent to me with the phone .
0	i used the phone a few_times and the battery drained very quickly .
0	my husband went to store again and they said it was because the new software was not available yet and it would work better , when that was available .
0	i accepted this .
0	at the end of april the bill was late being paid and the phone was disconnected , we paid it and customer_services said they could not re connect my accounts as there was an outstanding bill for a repair to the phone , we explained to them what had happened and was told a manager would call me back .
0	the phone was reconnected .
0	no one called .
0	the may bill was late being paid , however , on the 00th_may , my husband paid the bill and was again told that as there was an outstanding bill for a repair , the phone would not be reconnected .
0	he requested a call back from a manager and was told the 0th_june , he was to be without a phone until then , mine however was reconnected ???
0	i rang customer_services at lunchtime and was told the same thing , yet again went through the whole story as to why there was a bill on my account for a repair .
0	the female called vivien , said that a manager was going to call me back on the 0th of june , there was nothing she could do and if the bill had been paid that morning then it will take up to 00_hours to reconnect and i had to wait for a manager to call .
0	i was confused as my phone had been re connected , so why not my husbands ?
0	i rang again that evening and explained to lavin , what had happened , he said the bill was outstanding from march and needed to be paid , i said it wasn_’_t a bill but a repair fee so he spoke to the finance_department .
0	he said he will reconnect my husbands phone there and then , ( which does not tally up with viviens claim that it takes up to 00_hrs ), the phone was reconnected .
0	i then said i wanted a call from a manager the next_day , may 00th and i wanted a text to confirm this .
0	he agreed .
0	i received no text .
0	i also received no call from the manager as promised .
0	i woke_up this morning ( may 00th 0000 ) and my phone is not working again .
0	it will not charge and has yet again been sent in for repair .
0	the manager at the store said that as it had been working it would now be classed_as a new fault , so i would not qualify for a replacement phone .
0	he advised me to e_- mail the director , which i have .
0	i cannot understand how a multi million pound company can treat a customer this way and is allowed to continue to do so .
0	i cannot understand_why the stores have no rights over how to treat the customers , i have not the time to be phoning vodafone all the time certainly not whilst i am in the store , hoping they can sort it and they cannot .
0	numerous_times i have driven to the store , numerous_calls made , numerous_times i have repeated the story , numerous_times i have been told different things , numerous_times i have been ignored and numerous_times i have lost data , phone numbers , photo ’_s of my children and my newborn niece .

0	awaiting a response from you ,
0	other lenders would not entertain me .
0	clearaccount took my account banking into account and i borrowed an amount i can_afford .
0	very quick , straightforward with lower aprs than other lenders .
0	i '_d highly_recommend .
0	nice trade discount .
0	free delivery for orders over_£_00 .
0	not really any_problems to report ...
0	they delivered my recently ordered pc actually on time , i had no_complaints until the driver arrived at my door .
0	he rang the doorbell i opened it to see him drop my " please handle carefully " pc box both upside_down and from waist height .
0	when i commented on it , he simply grunted at me .
0	i have showdogs and kennels , there is a huge sign on the gate asking people to close it .
0	he walked out left the gate open , i shouted after him to close the gate and he replied ' whatever lady ' and kept walking .
0	a disgraceful representation of a company and i have a feeling from the reviews i '_ve seen below an all to regular view of this company .
0	a0 computer , and very fast service , 0 working_days it was turned around in and with me on the 0th .
0	i '_d looked around at other pc builders and actually came to pc specialists because of the number of good reviews i kept seeing online ... now i can see why !
0	the website was easy to use and covered all the options that i wanted and needed .
0	once the order was placed i was kept up to date by email and with the excellent my orders section on the website .
0	my only_slight complaint and suggestion would be to change courier .
0	my computer arrived , the doorbell_rang and he dumped the " please handle carefully " box upside_down and from waist height - i wasn_'_t impressed .
0	very fast turn - around and all_round excellent service !
0	i had no_problems at all .
0	fast delivery , friendly but to the point customer service .
0	would definitely recommend .
0	pleased with the service received from flubit , item was cheapest price on the net and was brand_new and sealed when received .
0	decent delivery time and well_packaged with good comms as to when the item had been dispatched , overall cannot_fault the company and would recommend them to others with no_hesitation .
0	the item ordered was £_00 at next cheapest site compared to £_00 ( with next_day delivery ) at babycity .
0	item arrived promptly and was exactly as expected , would certainly recommend and would use the site again .
0	thanks !
0	sarah_hayes was fantasic x
0	would recommend them to anyone , fast efficient service
0	sell your laptop are brilliant .
0	the website was easy to use and produced an accurate estimate , which they later paid in full .
0	the funds were in my paypal_account within 00_hours of the laptop leaving my house with the courier !
0	my only critisim would be that when arranging_collection you can only select a day , 0 - 0 monday to friday , and are unable to specify further - am or pm would have been nice .
0	they do offer to collect from business properties , but if ( as i do ) you start work midway_through the day and are not in the same place all day long it can be tricky .
0	i emailed them my request that am be one location and pm another and it was noted .
0	but the option to do this on the website would really be the cherry on the top .
0	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to use sell your laptop again , or to recommend them to anyone who '_ll listen !
0	!
0	i ordered an item from very . co . uk this was delivered to the depot 0_days ago no problem thus_far i received an_email from yodel saying they were going to deliver monday however should this be inconvenient the reply 0 , 0 or 0 depending which day you wanted so as i was working monday i opted for today wednesday .
0	i received an_email_confirming delivery would be today .
0	so all ok , so far yes .
0	i then go online to track it to make_sure it was coming today as i had booked day off work which was unpaid by the way so i could be in to sign for this parcel , it said it was still at the keighley depot .
0	oh joy i thought so i contacted customer_services who said somebody should ring me .
0	no one rung so i tried the online_chat route .
0	this chap although very pleasant would not actually answer any of my questions as in i asked why my parcel hadn_'_t been sent out for delivery ?
0	no response when was i going to get my parcel now ?
0	only answer was i can try for tomorrow but can '_t guarantee it another unpaid day i will have to take it is ridiculous .
0	and why did they confirm dates if they couldn_'_t honour the delivery ?
0	no answer .
0	i have to say this is not the first time this has happened to me and it appears that the collection of parcels are far more important than the actual delivery of them thus being if they run_out of time on the day by collecting the parcels they just simply won_'_t deliver them .
0	if they can email you to start with to say when they are coming then why can they email to say " actually you have wasted a whole day at home waiting as we have more important things to do than come to your address and deliver your parcel the day we said we would " if i hadn_'_t of contacted them they just not have turned_up a shocking way to provide a service .
0	and i am very disappointed no contact , no apology nothing the chap gave_me the complaints details whom i could contact then these promptly disappeared off the screen as soon as he ended the chat so the only way i can complain is on here .
0	extremely disappointed as it appears one inefficient depot does spoil the bunch .
0	this could be an amazing service that more people would use if they actually did what they said they were going to do .
0	i got a new phone on contract and i really didn_'_t like the handset i just couldn_'_t get to grips with it just wanted a quick and easy sale a friend recommended enviro_phone to so i went online and was amazed_at the price offered from_start to finish you were kept in the loop at all of the stages they are very professional and very fast sending out the packaging and when sending payment i would definitely reccomend them .
0	i would recommend this to anyone looking to unlock their phone .
0	fast , easy , cheap !
0	well_worth it !
0	i love vodafone ive tried other_networks but always end up coming_back to vodafone
0	i ordered a dress on the 00th_february delivery was supposed to take 0_days as of today ( 0th_march ) i still have not received my dress nor have i had any replies to the emails i sent to customer_services and when i try to call them i cannot get through and get told to try again later , each time i try i get the same response , im beginning to wonder_if they are even a real company or a scam to get money ?
0	?
0	the website is great - especially the " cocktail " section .
0	it '_s such a easy way to find out how to make my favorite cocktail and buy all the ingredients directly :)
0	it is a best online album for me , easy upload with picasa tools .
0	used it few_years , it is secure and fast , convenience .
0	used to blog with blogger everyday !
0	is a convenience online diary ^^
0	got their cheap and excellent deal before with their promo !
0	thanks to airasia as i can always fly with their exciting promo !
0	always found the ideal and cheapest hotel through agoda and user_friendly .
0	use this service last 0 year and my item got stolen .
0	i cant find my phone model specification after 0 years later ...
0	google is my dictionary !
0	!
0	i '_m suprised how good these 0d images are considering they come from a flat photograph - very impressive and i '_d thouroughly_recommend them .
0	i always use hostelbookers while travelling to browse and book_hostels online .
0	it is cheaper_than hostel_world as there is no booking_fee , i '_ve never had any_problems using it as a third_party to book , upon arriving at the place i '_m staying .
0	it '_s handy because you can filter your searches , view as a list or map_view , and various other features that make it easy to hunt for a place to stay , whatever your need .
0	i '_ve even managed to use it to book on intermittent wifi on my iphone with no_problems .
0	this is the first time i have used hospitality_finder , and certainly will not be the last !
0	i dealt_with gareth_burch , and from the first phone conversation to the follow_up call after the event he could not have been any more friendly and helpful .
0	i did not attend the event myself , i booked it for my director and he was extremely impressed with how the day went .
0	i would highly_recommend gareth and the hospitality_finder - thanks again for your help !
0	i '_ve been a buyer and seller on ebay since 0000 .
0	i love the ebay concept and making pocket money from the site is always great .
0	unfortunately , they suffer in terms of customer service .
0	if you have any_problems with ebay ( or paypal ) you '_ll have a very frustrating experience trying to get things sorted .
0	great website , and i still buy from there regularly , but selling is something i find myself doing a lot less lately .
0	easy to use website , quick delivery and great returns service .
0	i '_m a regular ample bosom customer , and on the rare_occasion that i order the wrong item , they have a brilliant returns service .
0	the staff are very helpful and i always get a quick email response whenever i contact them .
0	overall , a highly_recommended lingerie site .
0	i ordered a go pro camera with you for £_000 on 00rd august and promised delivery within 00 days .
0	it has now been 00 working_days and i have no go pro and no response to my emails regarding this matter .
0	i refuse to call an 0000 number from my mobile and i don_'_t have access to a landline so i am relying_on email communication which has not been forthcoming ,
0	i '_m pretty disgusted with the service at wowcher , especially as i stopped using another rival company as i had a similar experience with them .
0	i thought i would chance it with wowcher hoping that they were a better company but it appears not .
0	if i don_'_t receive any contact from them by the end of this week , i will be contacting cab and escalating this further until the matter is resolved .
0	as above .
0	would use again .
0	a great choice of stock for all your baking needs - i expect i will be back when i have more birthdays coming up !
0	delivery was fast and efficient .
0	overall , very pleased with planet_bake :)
0	i chose this website after_googling " muscle_milk " and seeing that the price was much_lower_than the other_websites .
0	the website explains that other_sites add shipping_costs into their products in order to have cheaper shipping or no shipping_costs for the customer .
0	supplementwarehouse . com does have a higher shipping_costs than other_websites but i went through the checkout proccess on supplementwarehouse . com and on another supplement site and even with the larger shipping amount the total was still less at supplementwarehouse . com !!
0	highly_recommend !
0	very good company .
0	easy to use and fast payment .
0	would use the company again .
0	definitely the best poker site for starters and high stakers no other poker site like it you can deposit a fiver and hit the 00 p 00 p cash tables and play against people all_round england ive played every site under the sun pokerstars , 000 poker , pkr , titan poker , william hill , partypoker and none compare to sky poker its the best poker site by far .
0	i would like to thank the home_laundry company and mark in particular for the exceptional customer service and for supplying a quality product .
0	i made a couple of glitches when ordering and instead of being ignored or fobbed_off mark went out of his way to ensure i got the product i wanted .
0	dare i say it - it is the most beautiful washing line ever !
0	my only recommendation would be to speak to mark or one of his colleagues prior to ordering to make_sure you are buying the right line for your needs .
0	i cannot recommend this company or its staff highly_enough
0	mrs_b
0	very efficient and helpful staff_members .
0	i was contacted within 0 minutes after making the payment to confirm the transaction and within the next two_days the watch arrived .
0	it looked exactly the same as presented on the website .
0	i would only appreciate to receive the invoice with my name and address on it .
0	as a professional makeup_artist i am always looking for quality products and regularly purchase from crown .
0	delivery is always fast too which is a bonus !
0	the 0pc hd set is amazing , each brush feels so luxurious on the skin and am considering purchasing another set for my kit .
0	another of my favourites is the b00 angle blush_brush , it also feels soft and luxurious whilst still being dense enough to apply colour evenly and is great for contouring !
0	i always recommend crown to my friends as they have the same quality as high end brands without the hefty price_tag !
0	well_done crown , keep_up the good work !!

0	i booked a roundtrip from london , heathow to san_francisco international ( sfo ) with them .
0	i thought i had a good deal : first leg of the trip was british_airways which i normally book , no problem there in logging in and choosing a seat ( although the better seats were predictably blocked off for third_party customers ). on the way back i was supposed to be flying aa to chicago and iberia to london .
0	the night before my flight i logged in using my reservation code , only to find that i could not choose seats . i called iberia , who claimed it was a ba ticket . ba claimed it was an aa ticket . i called aa and they were unable to find me on either flight . i called ba back in london and they were able to locate the correct reservation code with aa that finally logged me in . i then had to pay $_000 extra to reserve a seat . however , the story does not end there . this time i could not find my flight from sfo to ord and aa told me they could not tell me whether i was on the flight or not . i called netflights - only to discover they are closed on the weekends ( this was a sat evening flight ). it took three_attempts with aa to locate my reservation which lo and behold had been under the same booking code ba located - netflights or aa or both just did not put the itinerary together for me under the same booking code .
0	all is well i thought and proceeded to choose a seat . next_morning i tried to print my boarding_pass only to find that i couldn_'_t choose myself as passenger and the seat reverted_back to unassigned . i went to the airport , went to the self check in - of course same story there . an agent helped_me , to no_avail . the check in agent told me she '_s sorry but for this booking i do not have priority in boarding so i needed to go to the gate and wait for an agent - i still did not have the seat i paid for . an agent finally arrived and i made a beeline for the queue - only to find out guess_what , i had a standby ticket .
0	netflights or aa or both screwed_up and put me on standby for a ticket and seat i paid for .
0	had i not been the first in line i would have been stuck in sfo - the flight was indeed overbooked .
0	i would rate their service lower_than one star if i could .
0	never ever again .
0	i wrote to them and they were unhelpful claiming i got the correct e_- ticket number .
0	well no , e_- ticket number as well as the booking code they provided were of no use to me .
0	inf act on viewtrip .
0	com which netflights lead you to , my flight status reverted to ' not operating ' indicating that unbeknownst to me i had been relegated to standby on a ticket i paid for .
0	fast delivery , reliable service , wide_range of products , foolproof return and claim procedures , also offers good deals on used books and cds , and their prime and one day shipping policies rock .
0	can '_t ask for more .
0	i had to review you after getting my items on a timely_manner ( when one of your competitors lost the items in transit and then refused to refund me ): i will always order protein items from you .
0	i ordered egg_whites after_searching for an_alternative to us egg beaters in the uk and am very pleased .
0	i '_d also ordered crunchy peanut_butter and it '_s the best i '_ve tasted -- wasn_'_t expecting it as the only ingredient in it is peanuts !
0	perfect for my fitness goals .
0	my one request is if you can provide liquid_egg substitute as well -- not just egg_whites , similar to us egg beaters .
0	thanks for the good service !
0	i organised the hen_party for my sister in law and she still can not get over how perfect the weekend was !
0	we organised the house ( the lighthouse ) and the activities through big_fat brighton_weekend and i can not start to explain how helpful they were at every_stage of booking , how they were understanding with issues i had , how they helped_me decide what we could do to have the most fun and just providing us with the foundation for a great weekend .
0	one thing i would totally recommend to anyone booking a weekend away for a large_group is to stay in a big house , its much_better_than a groggy hotel where everyone has to pair off .
0	the house we stayed in was beautiful , big and airy .
0	the rooms were massive and the living_room was much bigger_than_expected !
0	which was perfect for all the games we had planned .
0	the activities were wicked , we did the pop video !
0	it was awesome , it was a proper studio and they did your make up , there were props and they taught you dance routines ( don_'_t worry they weren_'_t that difficult !)
0	i would just like to say a massive thank_you to clare she is so so lovely and absolutely awesome at organising brilliant weekends !
0	thank_you so much !
0	!
0	found a hotel and was able to book with no_problems .
0	then the hostel itself contacted me within an_hour or so to confirm which was wonderful .
0	have been shopping at amazon . co . uk for more than a year and i have nothing but good to say about the site .
0	really easy to use and most of the times i find everything i want on stock .
0	is probably the fastest ( items arrived the next_day ) and most reliable online shopping world .
0	purchased some items and was told by the website that i would be able to book a one hour delivery slot - next_day - with dpd .
0	i ordered and paid but there was still no option to book the delivery slot .
0	after_reading the emails , it appeared that they would only arrange delivery after dispatch .
0	so i waited , and late last night i had an_email to say my goods would arrive tomorrow !
0	not the next_day one hour_slot i was hoping for as this is now two_days_later but never mind i '_ll just book a days annual_leave !
0	so i try to track the parcel to see if i can either book my one hour delivery slot or at_least see a hour_window when they might arrive , but no , it just says it will arrive some time today .
0	so i '_m now using up an entire days annual_leave stuck in the house all day .
0	thanks viovet , what an_absolute con .
0	i will not be using you again !
0	prompt email_confirmation , easy to use and compare_hostels .

0	at first i was a little iffy about sending off my old_mobiles , but the process was easy , quick and most_importantly safe .
0	after putting in the brand and type of mobiles i wanted to get_rid of on the mazuma website , i was shown how much i could get for them and once i accepted the amount , i chose the best payment option .
0	then , i got sent the envelope and off they went !
0	the payment got sent within two_days .
0	i visited the website and printed_off the address_label and other required paperwork .
0	i popped my mobile in a jiffy_bag and the next_day received confirmation that it had arrived .
0	the phone was processed and checked , i opted for the same day transfer and was notified when the money was put into my bank !!!
0	i got £_00 for my phone which was a very welcome january bonus !!!!
0	!
0	able to clearly see the cost per_person and room option , quick easy and straight_forward .
0	the 00_% to hold the booking so much more helpful than paying all upfront to get the best deals !
0	i called their telephone customer service today to help find an item but received horrible customer service !!
0	:
0	0 ) they stuck to their rote learnt bookish lines insisting i give them item number .
0	there was absolutely no desire to budge or help or " waste time " on a customer wanting to spend the money on their company and buying the product .
0	0 ) to begin with , he spent good long time asking me to confirm my address , my landline_number , my email address , my full name as though i was calling a bank and not a happy shopping place .
0	0 ) when i said this is not so great customer service , there was not a single word of apology just to make me feel better at_least ... it was a mere okay ... like im calling some royal highness where i should be sorry i wasted their time .
0	0 ) might i add they deliver super slow .
0	0 ) the quality isn_'_t to die for - but would have been bearable if i was at_least treated like a customer they cared to retain .
0	it '_s so sad to see when a company is suffering because their customer service is amazingly horrible .
0	i would rather spend double the money on a product that is given to me with precious customer service
0	i bought a chemistry set for my nephew which was what he had wanted .
0	was really impressed by how quickly it was dispatched
0	i searched online for the best € rates and " the currency_club " topped the table .
0	i only needed €_000 and almost all providers ( except saga ) wanted a €_000 minimum order for free delivery but not tcc , their minimum is €_000 .
0	i ordered , cleared checkout ( before 0pm ) and then the postman_knocked for a signature the next_day when the monies arrived very well_packaged .
0	will be my first_port of call from now on .
0	littlewoods are great easy to use service and fast delivery always

0	needing a ring wraith sword urgently , as one often does , i looked around websites for a decent priced sword with cheap postage and a quick delivery time .
0	impossible , some may say !
0	however , i came_across this website on my search and was pleasantly_surprised by their pricing and shipping times .
0	all was fine and dandy until i got the check - out and saw an option for " click and collect ".
0	this absolutely blew my mind .
0	they would send it to a locker near me and then message me with the locker number and code the next_day !
0	whoah .
0	so , anyway , this was appealing and i ordered right away .
0	unfortunately , my sword was too_big for the locker and so i didn_'_t get to try out this secret - agent - style service , instead , they upgraded me to next_day delivery for free .
0	the package arrived_safely , the sword was very wraith - like and i don_'_t feel as though i spent too much .
0	i would recommend these fellows as i don_'_t have a bad_word to say about them .
0	if you want a company that :
0	0 . lies ,
0	0 . gives you wrong information ,
0	0 . blames everyone else when things go_wrong ,
0	0 . are unhelpful ,
0	0 . have terrible customer service ,
0	0 . try to rip you off ,
0	0 . refuse to help you ,
0	0 . hang up on you
0	0 . leave you waiting on hold for ages
0	00 . sends you on wild goose chases
0	then look no further , because with expedia you have found all that , plus much much more !
0	!
0	i was unfortunate_enough to have to have dealt_with expedia last month , and i swear i will never ever again use this dreadful company even if they became the last travel company on the planet .
0	trying to get a refund from these is like trying to get water out of a stone , only the stone would probably be a lot more helpful and courteous .
0	their customer service should really change their name to customer disservice , as this gives a much_better portrayal of the service you will receive from expedia .
0	their staff are rude , arrogant , unhelpful , send you on wild goose chases , hang up on you , refuse to help you out , speak down at you , insist they ' re correct even when all the facts say other wise , ignore your requests and generally don_'_t appear to be able to understand basic english .
0	very poor website - constantly crashes , pages show up as " page not found ", company take payment info and then website goes down , promise a 0p sale , yet website would not work .
0	total con !
0	quickly found the jacket i was looking for at a very competative price .
0	the online ordering system didn_'_t like me for some reason but my order was quickly and efficiently taken when i phoned up and my tnf jacket arrived the next_day .
0	i '_m very happy with the product and the service i '_ve received and will be back to check out some more deals soon .
0	quick delivery and great when it came to keeping_me informed how my delivery was processing .
0	the sweet in the parcel is a nice friendly touch too .
0	i am very satisfied and happy with charm_school - uk .
0	very nice contact .
0	quick answers by e_- mail .
0	highly_recommended .
0	gladly again .
0	the charm is beautiful and very well made :-) i love it .
0	just top !
0	they have not sent my item bought on the 00th of jan .
0	i have also written twice and not received a reply .
0	rubbish company .
0	this is the easiest_way to buy tyres , you put in your registration no and it tells you which tyres you need with all the different prices .
0	pick what you want , i always get the cheaper ones , ( i dont do a lot of miles and no long_journeys ).
0	then pick what day you want them fitted .
0	you just pitch up on that day and jobs done .
0	un site que_je_recommande absolument pour_l ' achat de montres .
0	rien_à dire sur_le produit et sur_les_délais , et aussi - fait rare pour_moi , comme je pense pour beaucoup_de client - excellente conseillère en_ligne , charlotte , qui accompagne le client tout au long de sa commande , du choix initial à_l ' achat du_produit .
0	absolument ravie des emplettes que_j ' ai_fait pour_la fin d ' année , que_je réitérerai sans aucun mal , si j ' ai la chance de retomber sur des professionnels du même acabit .
0	the items arrived shortly_after i ordered it .
0	this is the second time i have ordered with barrington_sports and was equally as pleased then .
0	i was recommended to use barrington_sports by a friend and have not been disappointed !
0	i am not a big_fan of online shopping especially when it comes to clothes .
0	that '_s why i had tons of questions and doubts_about my purchase .
0	i called three_times to verify the sizes and colors and to ask everything that could come to mind .
0	the lovely girl i spoke to was ever so patient and friendly .
0	she addressed my every doubt and gave_me a piece of mind - something i really appreciate when shopping online .
0	during the last few month i have had the most terrible experience with this platform '_s service .
0	i had posted a review for a company i '_ve been using for quite some time .
0	without_any explanation whatsoever my review got suspended .
0	when i tried to find out what was wrong i was asked to provide information and documentations containing personal information .
0	as i was trying to be helpful i sent them what they requested and for weeks there was no response .
0	during this time i was unable to even log_into my account .
0	i got banned for no reason and they had basically accused me of posting a lie !
0	i got so frustrated i tried to contact some of the other people who had posted reviews for the same company .
0	imagine my surprise when i found out i was not the only one going through all this .
0	" trust " pilot had requested at_least three more people for documentation containing information about their purchases and their addresses and phone numbers !
0	who do they think they are ?
0	now a few email complaints later i was finally granted the permission to use their service again .
0	my initial review was deleted .
0	i would not be surprised if this one gets deleted , too .
0	apparently if you write something they do not like your review disappears .
0	and your account is to follow .
0	edit_:
0	i just found out that there were other people who went through the same issues but their reviews did not get deleted and are still on the site .
0	i would very much like to receive an explanation .
0	why was my review deleted ?
0	what exactly didn_'_t trustpilot like about it ?
0	was it against some rules ?
0	what was the reason ?
0	i believe i deserve an explanation .
0	hostelbookers is a great site which makes it easy to find the cheapest but also the best hostels possible .
0	i '_ve_used it twice this week to book_hostels in hamburg and krakow and will_continue to use it when booking the rest of my trip around_europe .
0	it '_s really easy to use and makes the organising of a trip much simpler and stress_free .
0	i recommend !
0	as a specialist shop in electronics you would think that they would have a wide_selection of solder , not so .
0	they don_'_t even have something as basic as simple as 00 / 00 0 . 00mm solder .
0	the 0mm solder takes far too long to melt , and the tips for the solder irons are poor , they should at_least be chisel , not point .
0	had a card from moonpig , poor quality card , almost paper - like .
0	i am seriosuly considering funky_pigeon .
0	bought a jean_paul gaultier gift set , was easy to order and recieved item a day before stated , no_problems and no_quibbles .
0	fantastic quality , had a sofabed delivered , both very comfortable and affordable .
0	can '_t go_wrong with john_lewis or waitrose .
0	love the hampstead branch , very friendly staff and there is always a good audience .
0	they really do follow the wittertainment code of conduct !
0	!
0	i bought two items that were delivered via_royal_mail , they came quickly but unfortunately i needed to return one of the items because i accidently ordered the wrong_colour .
0	they were very helpful with my return and promptly sent me a replacement once i told them of my dilemma .
0	great service !
0	!
0	from the moment we walked_into marlows we received wonderful customer service .
0	a lady called margaret served_us , she explained all about the different type of diamonds before asking about what our price range was for my engagement_ring .
0	she then bought out lots of different rings to allow me to decide which one suited me best .
0	she was honest the whole time and didnt try and get us to up our budget .
0	i '_d definitely recommend marlows in terms of price , we got the ring for a third cheaper_than you would pay for one from a normal high_street shop .
0	thank_you for the wonderful service , we will_definetely be going back for our_wedding_bands :)
0	the website is really easy to navigate and the reviews are both useful and insightful .
0	my favourite feature is being_able to pay the deposit and a cancellation insurance fee , as i have found my plans can often change at the last_minute .
0	this means i will only lose a small_amount of cash , but have felt_confident that i have a place to stay when arriving somewhere on my own !
0	have used on more than one occasion always very quick delivery .
0	i am really happy with the items themselves and fancy_dress ball '_s service they dispatched my item very quickly as i ordered last_minute and the items should have arrived on time .
0	however due to interlink_express trying to deliver to the wrong building i didn_'_t get my order until the next_morning which was just about in time but later than i was hoping for .
0	i still got everything just about in time as i needed it that evening .
0	ordered on 00 . 00 . 00 no reply .
0	i emailed 0 times and still nothing !
0	am very pleased with this service & would definitely recommend it to all my friends & would also use in the future !!
0	many_thanks !
0	!
0	this is the first time that i have used servicing_stop and it made a huge_difference having someone on the end of the telephone who was polite , helpful , and kept me well informed .
0	having your vehicle serviced can be quite an expense as well as not knowing who you can_trust to deliver a good service .
0	i feel completely_satisfied with the work that has_been carried_out , the overall experience was a very good one , i will definitely be using servicing_stop again .
0	thanks
0	superb service , kept up to date during the whole_process .
0	we are so pleased with the canvas , the quality is flawless and looks better_than the photo we used !
0	thank_you for such a fantastic memory which we are now able to cherish forever :-)
0	i have used hostelbookers many , many_times and have never had even the slightest problem .
0	it '_s easy to navigate , has a great range of hostels for all over the world and tells you everything you need to know about each one .
0	the fact that there '_s no booking_fee and frequent competitions really helps too !
0	without hostelworld my year abroad would have been a much more stressful experience !
0	thank_you so much guys !
0	had the item i wanted , at a competitive price , easy to order and arrived the next_day !
0	brilliant service , thank_you very much :-)
0	never had such a disappointing experience as a customer .
0	they took money for my item nearly 00 days ago now .
0	they ignored several complaint emails .
0	they continue to send group emails about there is admin issues and your item is on its way but its not .
0	then today another email including a form i had already filled out 00 - 00 days ago .
0	i regret to say following this experience i will be avoiding this company from hereon as they clearly do not care about the individuals involved .
0	groupon provides a far more efficient and satisfactory experience and when that fails for what ever reason , they are more genuinely_concerned_about the individuals and give small_amounts of complimentary compensation unlike wowcher .
0	had been asked to do the photos for a wedding , although i am learning the art of photography , the lens choice was hard to select , i had one in mind and they helped_me understand the cons about that lens .
0	i spoke to dan at lenses for hire who was brilliant .
0	enjoyed speaking to him and took his advice .
0	he tried to help me save money and i really got the impression that he was there to help .
0	i would definately use these_guys again .
0	i loved the website with the comical humour and am greatful for the service .
0	i ended_up with great lenses and the service was amazing .
0	the photos are brilliant too .
0	thank_you guys !!!
0	!
0	sent my phone on the day it was approved somehow it hasnt made it there ???
0	tried to contct with no joy .... was worth more than 00_quid coud this be the reason ?
0	every other phone was next to no value got there just fine !
0	!
0	i bought 00 " human_hair , it was so thin i had to go online to find more as it just wasn_'_t enough for a full head .
0	i found what i needed on ebay at half the price !
0	wish i had looked there first instead of wasting my money !
0	i sent the phone off on thursday , received an_email_saying it had been received on friday and the cheque arrived on saturday !!
0	what more could you ask for , a professional , simple and fast transaction , i wouldn_'_t use any other mobile phone_recycling company .
0	anastasia is a very professional coach and she helped_me to look at my problem from a different point of view .
0	i recommend her as a coach , as she also has a lot of life experience , positive_attitude and a strong character .
0	i also really like her free tips that she is sharing in her weekly mailing - would recommend it to all my friends .
0	really fantastic prices for such a wide_range of products , so many shades and options too .
0	i informed them of the mis_- service i '_d received from royal_mail whom they used to send my item , so they refunded the postage !
0	brilliant service , lets me see what take_aways are available in my area , enabling_me to have an excellent choice !
0	good quality items , very reasonably_priced , very fast delivery .
0	will use again !
0	thank - you sammie_taylor for all your help , it was an easy and smooth process thank - you
0	supplement_warehouse offers the most extensive line of products , has excellent customer service , fast shipping , and the price match feature guarantees you '_ll get the lowest_price !
0	!
0	great deliverys , on time and hardly substitute my order .
0	arrived promptly .
0	easy to follow_instructions ( i ordered some drawers ).
0	great product and price .
0	couldn_'_t recommend these_guys more highly .
0	the call_centre girl was really lovely and helpful and asked the engineer to pick_up a carbon_monoxide alarm for us specially to fit as part of the call out because i mentioned i was worried_about it .
0	i called british_gas as well and whilst they were £_00 cheaper_than aspect they would have taken a week to come out and wouldn_'_t fix times .
0	aspect had an engineer out that day at exactly the time they said he '_d be there .
0	he was really friendly and efficient and left us totally happy that we weren_'_t going to die in the night from carbon_monoxide poisoning and that our boiler would last another wee_while - all good !
0	we also used them to fix our toilet last_year and while the guy was here he fixed our toilet lid which had been doing my head in as well as the flushing issue .
0	couldn_'_t recommend them more highly for a value for money , efficient and friendly service .
0	... so i '_m still not too sure how our old_mobiles are worth money these days and they never used to be but this is now the second time i '_ve_used mazumamobile and they '_ve been brilliant .
0	i was a bit_sceptical_about sending the phones first and even worried was it some sort of scam but as it was an old_mobile i would have binned anyway i thought i '_d nothing to lose so gave it a go .
0	the whole_process of me going on the website to them sending the bag to me posting it back ( all prepaid and just through a normal post box so no_hassle there ) and the money hitting my account took less_than a week .
0	i ended_up sending my old_blackberry too a few_months later and the service was just as quick and hassle_free .
0	they do what they say on the tin and couldn_'_t make the process any easier given they do need to see the phones first to check they ' re as you say on the website .
0	they also send some emails to keep you updated on status which is helpful .
0	couldn_'_t recommend them more if you '_ve any old_mobiles lying about doing nothing !
0	delivery was prompt .
0	price for sports_bra was competitive .
0	good online shopping_experience .
0	asos is where i shop if i need an outfit or shoes or something quick !
0	i am a premier customer so pay about £_00 to get next_day delivery for a year and exclusive first looks at sales .
0	i can order 0pm at night and the clothing can be there at my desk the next afternoon .
0	they give you a delivery time_slot too so you know roughly when it '_s going to arrive .
0	good range of clothing , good prices .
0	only con is i spend too much time browsing the site - too much choice !
0	prices competitive when you buy in bulk , fast delivery time , never had any_problems .
0	very happy customer here :-)
0	it '_s one of my fav ........ site nt only me bt most of the people thats_why definetly it have to get five_stars :) the clothes are so fashionable , cute n comfort and the price is decent lop it < 0 ..... yesstyle is doing awesome job
0	i had never used this service before and had to use the live_chat option .
0	the girl that helped_me ( sarah_hayes ) was very pleasant and quick in responding to my queries !
0	the first time to buy here .
0	great dr . martens , perfect_condition !
0	delivery took 00 days by royalmail .
0	it is very fast !
0	kind_regards ,
0	from russia
0	the lighthouse was spacious , comfy and the livingroom as stunning as the photographs .
0	beds were comfy and the location is great , there are cafes in every direction , which is perfect for breakfast .
0	only_thing which could have been there and wasn_'_t was some basics , tea / coffee / sugar / olive_oil .
0	it meant we had to buy everything in and couldn_'_t use it all in the couple of days stay .
0	all in all it '_s a great place .
0	third set of blinds i '_ve ordered - they ' re so quick it '_s amazing !
0	and great value .
0	i can not believe what i have just experienced .
0	absolute disgusting service .
0	i am almost 0_months pregnant , we received a delivery of some very heavy items .
0	i asked if driver could just pop the items inside for me as he was simply dumping them outside .
0	the driver proclaimed he is ' self - employed and has no_obligation to bring the items inside for me '.
0	when i pointed_out that i was clearly not in a position to be lifting these items , his response was " yeah , i see your problem , but i don_'_t have to take anything inside for you ''.
0	when i asked him how i was supposed to do it , he shrugged and said " not my problem as it '_s not something i have to do ".
0	at which point he walked back to his van and drove_off .
0	leaving me on the doorstep with 0 heavy items and nobody to help me .
0	still in shock about it .
0	absolutely apalled .
0	shame i had to even give 0_star .
0	would have preferred none .
0	wow service !!
0	which is unheard of these days !!
0	no_probs whatsoever .
0	fast delivery and i did an exchange which was dealt_with efficiently .
0	i have had 0 pairs of glasses from glasses_direct and they are great value look good and are comfortable to wear :)
0	this is the 0nd set of these lights i have bought now !
0	they are great !
0	both_times the delivery has_been prompt !
0	the customer service is great and when i initially thought i may want to return my order ( before it had been delivered ) i rang the company to see what i could do and spoke to a lovely helpful woman_who didnt sound resentful ( like most_places i come_across ) that i may want to return the item and informed me that its actually free to return items !
0	which i think is a great service !
0	as i have been living in costa rica and am now moving around during semana santa , hostelbookers . com were great in showing was what available within my limited_budget .
0	it has_been a great help at home , europe and the wider world .
0	great service and will_continue to use it !
0	thanks !
0	so despite the wheels that i needed had been_discontinued , the company informed me by email and gave_me a good selection of other wheels with the same specification .
0	for someone like me who isn_'_t knowledgable about wheels and tyres , they were incredibly helpful and efficient !
0	tim deserves a bonus !!!
0	wonderful help !
0	very good , honest and patient thank_you very much .
0	you '_ve a great employee on your hand .
0	00 / 00 !!!!!
0	!

0	hello_canvas adjusted my photo to include the top of a tree - just to make it perfect - for no extra_cost .
0	finished_product excellent quality and packaging sturdy and shipped quickly .
0	folding of canvas around frame very intricate and particular attention to detail .
0	if your print surrounds the frame - it gives a stunning 0d appearance .
0	fairly costly , but if purchased through one of their regular special_offers , well_worth the money .
0	this is my second purchase and would definitely recommend and am sure i will use them again in the future .
0	frames are sturdy and easy to attach wall fittings to .
0	ordene unas flores llegaron a tiempo sin ningún problema totalmente recomendado
0	they were the first company i phoned for a quote .
0	after i spoke to jacob i didn_'_t ring anyone_else .
0	he was so helpful .
0	they sent me a sample that i got the very next_day and they designed and suggested better options for our company air fresheners .

0	many_thanks ,
0	hoyles of todmorden
0	i '_ve_used interparcel many_times and never had a problem .
0	i always use parcelforce as the courier and never had a problem there either .
0	the website is easy to navigate , and the customer service when you do need to call them is very efficient and helpful .
0	i will use them everytime i need to send items bigger_than what royal_mail allows .
0	easy to use & attractive site full of good advice & information .
0	great prices on all products - a lot_cheaper_than buying from the vets !
0	fast & reliable delivery .
0	delivery with animed is so good that we have now taken_advantage of their scheduled order service so that we no_longer have to worry_about having to remember to re - order as the products will arrive straight to our door on the same day each_month !
0	i was really worried that leaving it to the last_minute to buy v_festival_tickets , i would end up getting ripped_off , but luckily i stumbled_across double0tickets and i have to say it really surprised me at how reasonable they were .
0	i now have 0 tickets for v_festival and paid a really good price for them .
0	i would definitely recommend double0tickets to others and will definitely be using them again myself !

0	two colours looked very similar in the bullet so i asked if i could exchange one for another .
0	fast response from the customer service team , was allowed to keep all the lipsticks i already had and was sent out the chosen ' replacement ' shade free of charge !
0	excellent customer service !

0	flowers did not arrive on special day as requested .

0	we thought we were getting a really good deal going with this company and my sister organised everything and we paid the money for the hen_night .
0	my sister then started having problems with the company saying that they couldn_'_t get us all in the same hotel and that we would be at_least 00mins walk apart_from each other , they also said that the people staying in the hotel had to pay extra money .
0	my sister constantly tried to get_hold of management at the company and was told that the two members in charge were not available and they would return her call .
0	no - one ever returned her call and she had to call them back .
0	she called them back at_least 0 - 0 times but the person she needed to speak to was apparently busy or in and out of meetings all the time .
0	in the end my sister got so fed_up that she cancelled everything , despite them saying that they wouldn_'_t give her any money back .
0	in the end they said they would arrange for us all to stay in the hotel but due to all the problems we had already had we all agreed it would be less hassle for us to cancel and for my sister to pay everyone else the money back .
0	we were worried that something_else would go_wrong on the actual day .
0	i would avoid this company at all costs the customer service is shocking and all they are interested in is taking your money .
0	i was expecting a parcel delivery from yodel from goods which i had ordered from a website which i use on a regular_basis .
0	these goods were worth well over_£_00 .
0	i was working on my laptop during the day which is next to the window which looks out of my the front of my house .
0	sure enough a yodel van came up and the man got out from the drivers seat and got into the back of the van and was in there for about 0mins .
0	the driver then got back in the drivers seat and drove_off .
0	shortly_after this i received an e_- mail_stating that they had delivered my parcel which they clearly hadn_'_t because i had seen them drive off with no attempt at delivering the package .
0	it '_s now been over 0 week and yodel are still apparently investigating at to where my parcel is .
0	this isn_'_t the first time this has happened and it '_s very frustrating to say the least .
0	i am now avoiding all companies that use yodel as a form of delivery !
0	i purchased the gel nails course along with the maintenance course and couldn_'_t wait for it to arrive .
0	i was pleased when i received the courses the following_day .
0	shopping on the website was easy and delivery was really reliable with very detailed tracking_information so i could track my parcel '_s every_step of the way .
0	i ordered a water_bottle from the usn website and was impressed at how speedy the delivery was . i was considering purchasing some of the usn powders from here , how - ever i have found them much_cheaper at other_places , which is a shame as if the prices were lowered i would also the powders from here as well due to the reliable and speedy delivery .
0	i found that out of all the mobile recyle companies that mazuma have the edge over them and are very reasonable_prices given and that they accept mobiles that are not working and they are helpful , they keep to their promise and process the phones and money on the same day i '_ll definately recomend mazuma to my family and friends
0	all through the process of my order , after my order arrived and still to this day i have had great communication from them .
0	my order was delivered very quickly and i couldn_'_t have been happier .
0	the branded jewellery all came as shown in there original packaging .
0	the price was affordable and worth it .
0	i highly_recommend this company .
0	i loved the jewellery so much i kept 0 of everything for myself !!!
0	i will be dealing_with them again in the future .
0	very easy process , acknowledged phone when received and very quick payment by_bacs .
0	great service !
0	i have recently dealt_with hen_heaven and can safely say that they have some of the most helpful people i have encountered in quite some time !
0	i have specifically been dealing_with owen and he has_been so incredibly helpful , any question i put forwards to him would not only get answered fully with extra information but he would get back to me in at_least 00mins ... fantastic !
0	i would recommend this company to anyone who is looking to organise a hen_do and wants it to be a stress_free experience .
0	brilliant service that cannot be_faulted !
0	really easy website to navigate .
0	great prices .
0	exceptional service .
0	i was very lucky at christmas to receive one of these blocks .
0	absolutely_beautiful .
0	the personalisation of the block is really unique , and makes it even more special .
0	cannot recommend this company and its products enough .
0	outstanding .
0	fantastic gift idea .
0	really beautiful packaging .
0	the website was incredibly simple , i had to ask a question about the picture as i wasn_'_t sure if it was the standard bunch .
0	i got an answer almost_immediately saying it was , as beautiful as they where i upgraded and my mum was absolutely over the moon with the flowers .
0	i would happily_recommend this company to anyone and i will be using them again in the future .
0	thank_you
0	i love the kindle and cant_wait for the new version !!!
0	!
0	download of books is fast and easy .
0	i have been using isme for around a year .
0	i have never had a problem and the delivery is fab !
0	would definitely recommend the company to all who are thinking_about buying from them .
0	so quick and easy this is the 0th time i '_ve_used mazuma would reccomend to everyone !
0	thank_you , your customer service was without fault .
0	i recently_sold my mobile phone through mazuma , i got a quote off the website , confirmed that i was happy with what they offered me and within next few_days i received the free post bag and delivery note to send my mobile phone to them in .
0	then within the next couple of days the cheque was delivered back to me .
0	very easy , convenient and reliable .
0	excellent communication through whole_process via_email .
0	000_% satisfied and would recommend everyone to use it if they are wanting to sell their mobile phone at a good price .
0	i '_ve been appalled by the service provided by cash_generator .
0	i tried to purchase an iphone on line from them coming from their store in derby .
0	the frist phone they sent me was the wrong_colour and locked to a network different from that specified in the advert .
0	i called the store and they politely apologised and said if i sent the phone back they '_d refund me .
0	a week_later another phone arrived .
0	this one was faulty as the speakers didn_'_t work .
0	i called them to explain the fault and they told me to send the phone back .
0	which i did and called to check they '_d received it and make_sure they knew what the fault was .
0	the next_day i called to find out what they were going to do about it and they informed me they '_d tested the phone , it was fine and they had posted it back to me .
0	unsurprisingly , the phone did not miraculously work as a result of their ' testing '.
0	on speaking to them again it transpired the manager who tested the phone wasn_'_t told what the fault was so didn_'_t test the sound .
0	he then informed me that they could pay for it to be fixed but could not refund me since it had been more than two_weeks since my first transaction and i was not within my rights to receive a refund anymore .
0	i don_'_t see how my only option legally is to have to wait to get it fixed , which i would no_doubt have to pay for before i got reimbursed , or pay yet again to send it back to them for them to get it fixed .
0	what kind of shop is this that it has taken 0 deliveries , and nearly 0_weeks and they still_haven_'_t produced the item i have now more than paid for ?
0	don_'_t ever purchase anything from this shop and expect them to get it right first time , if at all .
0	having been quoted an exorbitant price by our usual_supplier for an imaging drum and a yellow toner , i decided to shop around to find the items cheaper elsewhere .
0	printerland . co . uk not only charged us less_than half the price of our usual_supplier , but the delivery service was extremely fast and the products arrived in great condition .
0	i will be using printerland . co . uk for future printer_consumables orders .
0	if only people listened to the bad_reviews this company would be longer running , i used beginning of the year when my parcel never arrived i was told the label had probably come off , with lots of rude messages from an ebay buyer i refunded fully , it took another 0_weeks of constant_emails to get refunded and that wasn_'_t even in full even_though i had paid more to cover it , so last wed i thought i would give them another try and again low and behold my parcel has_gone wallows again .... was collected so the tracking says and that '_s it .......
0	they don_'_t know where my parcel is and got same response " the label may have come off " that label was stuck to that package the only way it could come off if it was cut with scissors !!
0	( because of them saying this last time ) something fishy going on here for 0 high priced covered parcels to go missing ....
0	even_though i am covered i bet again i don_'_t get a full_refund and i will have another unhappy ebay member .... if you have any sense you will read all the negative_reviews and book with someone_else .
0	i gave them the benefit of the doubt and i am going to be out of pocket again :( worst service ever
0	the service was quick and efficient and delivered on time however the helium_gas_cylinder ran_out before all the balloons that came in the pack were filled and the latex balloons didn_'_t float very well despite following all the instructions with regards to size etc .
0	a good time save but no cheaper_than high_street stores .
0	the large foil number ballons were excellent .
0	don_'_t be_fooled , laura_ashley is a company that has appalling customer service .
0	i bought a sofa in store with a new laura_ashley credit_card , but cancelled within the 00 hour_window .
0	it took me 0_weeks and 0 emails to the ceo to get my money back .
0	they also tried to charge me 00_% for cancelling but i had mithered them for written confirmation of my cancellation so they didn_'_t have a leg to stand on .
0	that '_s another point - you deal with the customer_services on the phone but they don_'_t send confirmation emails so it '_s your word_against theirs .
0	a very dangerous game when £_000s are at stake .
0	each time i had to email the conversation to them via their website form so that i could get written confirmation .
0	i am_disgusted with the service and couldn_'_t be more relived that i cancelled my order prior to it '_s arrival .
0	if their customer service is this bad , i don_'_t even want to imagine the final product !
0	i initially ordered a sofa from laura_ashley .
0	after_placing my order in store , i did some_research and saw a plethora of awful reviews .
0	the vast_amount of negative_reviews concerned me so i cancelled my order .
0	this was a lot harder than it should have been and i didn_'_t receive a refund until four_weeks and three emails to the ceo later .
0	this negative experience led me to do a lot of research_into my sofa purchase .
0	i ordered fabric and leather swatches from three companies .
0	saxon '_s arrived the next_day !
0	saxon had the best reviews i have ever_seen and with their showroom a few miles_away , i decided to pop in and see what the fuss was about .
0	i was not disappointed .
0	their sofas are even more beautiful in person and their customer service is incredible .
0	on our first visit we must have taken 00_minutes and asked 000 questions .
0	adele was incredibly helpful and knew the answer to every one .
0	we left with a sofa in mind and had booked in a home visit to make_sure we had enough room .
0	saxon offers an amazing service where they send one of their delivery men to your properly to make_sure the desired sofa will fit through doors etc .
0	it costs the same as the delivery fee and will be taken off your total if you do buy a sofa .
0	we were told we had enough room so we could go_ahead an order the sofa .
0	coincidentally i checked their website again and saw that they had my sofa and an armchair in their clearance_section at a nicely reduced_rate .
0	adele called us to see if we wanted to buy a sofa and i explained that i had seen the clearance sofa but would like to see larger pictures .
0	within minutes she had emailed me a link to their facebook_page where i could scroll to my heart '_s content .
0	the next_day we popped_into store and she even let us see the sofa in the factory .
0	obviously this was only the case as it was a clearance sofa and they had it in storage , but it was wonderful to see it before we bought it .
0	we ordered it expecting a 0 week wait .
0	however , as we are local , the delivery men were able to squeeze us in .
0	we had the sofa and armchair by the end of the week !
0	we couldn_'_t be_happier .
0	if you are looking for a new sofa , look no further .
0	very quick to respond when i changed my order ; kept me informed_throughout and had replacement within a few_days .
0	would highly_recommend .
0	price seemed to be the best around too
0	nikki was extremely_helpful , very well - informed and charming .
0	the showrooms were exceptionally well set out and we had ample space to view , try out and relax .
0	the only_slight quibble was that we had to pay for delivery , as we had chosen a sofa which had been reduced due to a change of mind on the part of the buyer ; it was still quite_expensive and i resent paying for delivery when a much_cheaper sofa ( at half the price ) would have been delivered free !
0	also , we were told we might have to pay storage charges , as we cannot pick_up the sofa for several weeks !
0	this has not , thankfully transpired .
0	we will be going back to order another sofa , but have decided to wait_until we have exchanged contracts on the sale of our home so we don_'_t risk any more charges
0	too early to say how long it will last but looks are excellent and size is generous
0	excellent service from the start .
0	even the delivery dirver was pleasant and helpful ; would alwasy use your firm again .
0	many_thanks
0	if you ' re headed to prague for your last_minute jaunt of freedom before your big commitment then i can highly_recommend these_guys to give you best seeing off that you could_possibly experience .
0	so good we ' re heading back just for the fun of it !
0	we found flashbay to be a highly professional and reliable company .
0	the service was fast , the product was high_quality and our account_manager ( jack_walton ) was extremely_helpful and knowledgeable .
0	monsoon accessorize will definitely be placing an order with flashbay next season .
0	the envelope to send off my phone arrived really quickly .
0	got email_confirmation after a day or 0 tht my phone had passed the tests and they gave_me a date of about 0 working_days that the money would be in my account .
0	money was there in the day they said .
0	would definitely use this company again .
0	flawless
0	having worked for a company for over 0 years who use citylink and send many parcels through them daily - i have never had so many incidents causing so much stress and problems from one company .
0	here are but 0 of those incidents that have happened in the past 00_hours :
0	0 .
0	my customer calls me to say the goods havent arrived ( despite us doing our job and the courier failing to deliver - obviously the customer will balme us as we are their contact ).
0	i call citylink as on the site all it has his " package mis sorted ".
0	the man i spoke to advised that the address was wrong , and they are now going to be delivering them to the correct_address .
0	i ask what the new address is which he tells_me and it is exactly the same as the original address .
0	after i ask to know why this package has_been delayed when the " new " address has no changes from the original , i was greeted with a lot of stuttering and dithering before being put on hold for 00_minutes for him to " investigate ".
0	he then had no new information to give me so i expect he probably went for a cup of tea and found out nothing .
0	the package was finally delivered to the " new address " 0_days late and missed the customers event the goods were needed for so rendered_useless so a refund was made from our company .
0	0 .
0	a top_priority client needed goods for another event - he calls to say they havent arrived .
0	i call citylink and the person i speak to says they were sent to the wrong depot ( for no apparent_reason other than stupidity ).
0	they said they would be sent to the correct depot today , to be delivered tomorrow ( only 00_hours after the event they were needed for had finished - therefore , again rendered_useless ).
0	i asked to speak to a manager who i begged and pleaded with to get these to the customer on that day to make it in time for the event .
0	she said she would find out and call me back .
0	now this is the best bit - despite us having paid for the pre00 :_00am service on that day ( and it now being past 00 :_00pm ) she said we could get the parcel there today but it would be after working hours and it was cost us £_000 . 00 !!!!!
0	so i said , so let_me get this straight , we have paid to have these good delivered this morning , someone at your moronic operation has sent them to the wrong depot meaning the parcel is late and you ' re saying we need to pay for this ???
0	yes she says .
0	the route cause of this was that citylink had failed to update our it system with them which mean the majority of the packages we sent out would be sent to the wrong place .
0	their remedy for this was to go through each manifest individually to make_sure they went to the correct_address .
0	this is absolutely not possible as we are a huge manufacturing company distributing hundreds of parcels daily so to have someone check this manually would take hours of time which we cannot_afford to have someone doing .
0	i have been imploring to my superiors to stop using citylink and am hoping that finally we will be looking to use an_alternative courier .
0	you would think that with the amount of money we spend with them , we would be treated as a priority and they would do their best to keep us however when i expressed my dissatisfaction and the fact we will be looking to leave , the response i got from the manager there was " ok ".
0	i am absolutely_disgusted and will avoid using citylink at all costs when it comes to personal use and will endeavour to get the company i work for to stop using them !
0	!
0	do not use this company - chocolate teapot - useless !!!
0	!
0	my friend recommend this site for the prices , free_samples , and selection .
0	i '_ve only made one order so far but i will for sure be a future customer .
0	great products and prices !
0	googled for a valentines florist , iflorist was the first result .
0	unfortunately for me their service , communication , flower quality and experience is the complete_opposite .
0	in all dealings i have made over the internet i have never ever had such a bad_experience , i received the email about the nottingham distribution center being delayed to the 00th .
0	at this point i emailed to cancel the order ... to which i received no confirmation or correspondence .
0	so the flowers arrived at 0pm on the 00th even_though they were unwanted .
0	the next problem is the quality , if you want petrol_station forecourt flowers delivered by a courier then all i can say is this is the company for you .
0	they were an actual embarrassment , weltered .
0	on to the communication , the call_centre never answer and i have had no emails still .
0	the grand summary is the " valentines_day flowers " i ordered did not arrive on valentines_day and arrived even_though cancelled which is neither what i wanted so i will be chasing a full_refund .
0	the other inconvenience is the £_00 i had to pay a local_florist and the inconvenience of rushing_around to sort this on valentines morning .
0	to summarise i wouldn_'_t wish this level of service on my worst_enemy .
0	compared to other_websites that i viewed , including my go - to amazon , supplement_warehouse had the best selection and lowest_prices , including shipping , for the cliff shot gels ( 00 pack ).
0	i would definitely shop on this website again .
0	i am not joking ... mazuma_mobile saved me big time ...
0	when i thought all hope was gone and i was really upset because i couldn_'_t do anything with my mobile ... mazuma_mobile accepted it and gave_me a brilliant price for it !!
0	i was seriously over the moon !!
0	i can '_t thank mazuma_mobile enough ...
0	thank_you !!>..
0	0 -)
0	the card team is my favourite website for buying pokémon cards .
0	they have great customer service and their website just keeps getting bigger and better with new things to buy .
0	would highly_recommend !
0	x
0	no_problems happy with the service i received
0	best price and service !
0	easy to navigate and provides relevant_information .
0	a smooth_transaction from order to delivery .
0	great product too , fab !
0	easy and fast service to use .
0	i ordered a bag for my clothes online , it arrived 0_days_later .
0	i filled the bag and arranged a pick_up date .
0	the courier came as promised and i had the money in my paypal_account the very next_day !
0	can '_t get much_better_than that , cash for clothes i didn_'_t want .
0	i love the selection of bags and purses on this site some of the other departments aren_'_t as good particularly the home section .
0	i ordered a travel wallet which arrived quickly .
0	i '_ve ordered twice from here and never had any problem .
0	another company let_me down and i finally gave up on them after waiting for 0_weeks .
0	one call to kac and i had my tap within 00_hours , delivered in a one hour delivery slot and i saved over_£_000 !!!
0	would definately recommend them
0	i bought an item as a christmas gift for my partner .
0	unfortunately the item was not suitable , superfi refused refund even after many emails and emailing manager .
0	offered an exchange as a gesture of good will !!
0	!
0	appalling customer service , to get a refund you need to return within 0_days of order ... and so they obviously dont care about the christmas market .
0	still have £_000 worth of audio_equipment unopened in its box which is completely_useless and worthless thanks to superfi .
0	incdently , superfi were still selling the item at full price and so wouldnt have made any loss by refunding me .... as i said appalling customer service ... i will be taking my custom striaght back to amazon who are top_notch company !
0	before we went to iceland , i booked this online , it was so easy .
0	the rates were fantastic .
0	we were picked_up from our hotel and taken to the office to collect the car .
0	it was a toyota i go , as promised .
0	the staff helped_us with a route back to the hotel .
0	maps and instructions came with the car .
0	the overall condition was excellent .
0	we were late leaving for our flight , they even collected the car from our hotel .
0	we recommend you use this company as they are excellent
0	i wowchered 0 bracelets rrp £_000 . 00 @ £_00 each .
0	at checkout i paid £ 0 . 00 pp each .
0	only 0 arrived .
0	there us no phone contact with customer_services , only a faulty email .
0	i contacted wowcher who over 0_weeks have sent in excess of 0 emails .
0	all ignored !!!!!
0	wowcher have only a mobile number for fasgion revenge which is never answered .
0	wowcher have returned the £_00 and the £ 0 . 00 pp which fashion revenge has kept !
0	the bracelets are cheap rubbish .
0	what if i had paid full price !!
0	rubbish goods .
0	rubbish company !
0	steer well clear .
0	very professional and friendly service .
0	highly_recommended !
0	love shopping here
0	chose the costume i wanted .
0	specified i needed it the next_day , as i '_d left it to the last_minute .
0	placed my order before 0pm had it by 00am next_morning .
0	fantastic .
0	does what it says on the tin .
0	what more can i say .
0	amazon know customer service .
0	i have used them on multiple occasions and they have never_failed me .
0	:)
0	i was clearing_out a room after a relative died , and boxed up his dvd '_s .
0	we used two companies .
0	the first [_link_] and the second music_magpie .
0	we sent 00 dvd '_s to music_magpie by courier , and 000 to [_link_] ( as they offered more money ).
0	the boxes were both collected / posted on the wednesday .
0	the wednesday after i had received payment from [_link ].
0	yet music_magpie were denying receipt of their parcel even_though we had a courier collection leaflet .
0	i rang up on the thursday and was told the parcel had arrived at the depot today .
0	i asked why it took so long - he said its not a priority .
0	nice !!!
0	he said that i should get an_email_saying that it had been received that day .
0	i received the email two_days_later then expected after 0 more phone_calls .
0	waste of time .
0	i still am yet to receive confirmation or email / cheque from them .
0	poor poor service .
0	i suggest you use sell to [_link ], if you want your dvd '_s to be a ' priority '.
0	i cant_believe it has taken 0_weeks longer then the other company to check not even a third of the total the other company checked .
0	what an amazin company !!
0	great value , super_fast delivery n really great quality products !!!
0	will_defo use tshirt_studio again n recommend it 0 friends n family !!!
0	:-) xxx
0	i came_across this website by searching online for what i thought was a relatively obscure beauty product and they had it !
0	sometimes uk women need to look further_afield especially when they read international beauty blogs and watch videos from youtube reviewing certain products which are not so easy to get over here .
0	i would recommend this website and would definitely shop_here again .
0	i ordered a clarifying shampoo and a dermalogica moisturiser and i loved the selection and the free shipping .
0	i would definitely shop there again when i need to make more beauty purchases .
0	i found plumbtap via their ebay store and purchased some groher tap and shower items .
0	communication from the company was fantastic and they helped_me with a complicated vat issue .
0	incredibly helpful and always quick to answer_questions .
0	delivery was within 00_hours and the items look great .
0	if definitely use them again and highly_recommend them to anyone .
0	i placed my order and the joules jumper arrived the next working day .
0	excellent service , the best price around , great all_round , i '_m really pleased .
0	thank_you !
0	i used moneysupermarket . com to compare the prices of a sebo x0 extra vacuum and it said that freenet ltd was the cheapest place around .
0	i had never_heard of them so i was a little_wary and put the purchase on my credit_card rather_than debit_card just in case !
0	i have been incredibly impressed by the company , i received my sebo within 00_hours of placing the order and the local courrier company were really helpful as well .
0	i received not only an invoice but once the item had been collected from freenet ltd i received a courrier tracking_number which was updated_frequently .
0	the sebo is exactly as_described , no_problems_whatsoever and i '_m a very happy customer .
0	i would not_hesitate to recommend or use them again in the future .
0	i cannot_speak highly_enough of my online estate_agent .
0	i had a few_teething_problems to begin with , as would be expected with a relatively new business .
0	within hours of reporting the problems ( photos not too great ) i had a personal phone_call from one of the managing directors ( which shows how dedicated they are even at the very top !)
0	and the problems were sorted instantly .
0	my property sold within a few_months for only £ 0000 under asking price .
0	maybe a high_street agent could have negotiated a bit more , but with their extortionate_fees i would have been £ 0000 out of pocket rather_than £ 0000 so i '_m still £ 0000 better off !
0	the staff are so friendly and are always at the end of the phone .
0	i found them to be a lot more contactable than the several high_street agents i have used in the past .
0	my solicitor ended_up being completely inept and had it not been for the advice and support from the team at my online estate_agent , i would have gone crazy !
0	they helped every_step of the way , right up to moving day !
0	i honestly cannot_speak highly_enough of them !
0	i '_m hoping to stay in my new house for a long while now , but if i ever did decide to move again , i would use my online estate_agent without_any hesitation !
0	ordered a few products for myself and received them at value cost and fast delivery
0	e careers provide excellent support from beginning throughout and has supported me with a problem already .
0	honest value and good communication
0	everything0pounds is a company use again to buy cheap fashion wear .
0	ideal for those who can '_t pay designer costs on the high_street .
0	highly_recommend !
0	insurance_cover meets my needs
0	low_cost makes it affordable giving you the option of annual payment or monthly_payments .
0	i thought this website was really easy to navigate .
0	it was easy to find hostels in the area i wanted .
0	being_able to read the reviews was extremely_helpful .
0	i also liked that you could look at the hostels on a map so you knew how close they were to the city_centre .
0	overall i was very impressed !
0	!
0	one of the lowest_prices i found that stocked my product .
0	plenty of communication via_email and text_message .
0	fast delivery .
0	only problem i have is that the website is too ' busy ' and not really user_friendly , which made me question how trustworthy the site was .
0	but it '_s all been legit for me .
0	:)
0	best price for burton luggage , fantastic delivery and service .
0	... bigger selection of women '_s gear please !
0	:)
0	best prices for catwalk hair_care .
0	fantastic service and delivery .
0	great site .
0	i regularly shop_here , some would say far too regularly !
0	always have the best prices , free delivery and returns and fantastic customer service .
0	the best online store bar none .
0	i '_ve only made one order so far but it certainly wont_be my last !
0	safe secure shopping and great priced environ_products .
0	fast shipping and friendly service .
0	thanks btt !
0	fast delivery which is always good and very high_standards within products .
0	contact information in case of any_issues and regular_emails to update you on your parcel is something not all websites give .
0	would defiantly use again and recommend .
0	the chat box is a really good idea as the service is quick and easy , my problem was fixed within a matter of minutes .
0	thanks for your help !
0	i really cannot_praise feelgood_lenses for their reliable and quick service , standard delivery to ireland was really quick and i can not fault it ...
0	the title pretty_much sums it up !
0	either you devote your entire day to sifting_through the piles of poorly sorted clothes in the shop or you dont !
0	wish there was an easy option .
0	online would be perfect !
0	i love ebay i buy & sell items on there .
0	granted sometimes delivery times are annoying but as a seller also i understand the constraints of day to day life .
0	otherwise ebay have been brilliant but make_sure to check feedback of buyers and sellers alike , and always read the small printed bits !
0	i feel the need to point out this company is in league with marisota , if you search for their reviews it will tell you alot of what to expect !
0	if i were you i '_d steer well clear , and if your tempted in for gods sake make_sure you keep note of who you speak to and when it can help when it comes to writing a complaint to their md !
0	i ordered a pair of boots for £_00 .
0	they didnt turn_up next_day despite me paying in full on my debit_card and being assured they would , then marisota sent me out a replacement pair and didnt charge me for them until they could find the other parcel .
0	the replacement pair turned_up at the wrong_address !
0	this over the space of 0_weeks having given up i didnt bother trying the boots and instantly returned them .
0	in the midst of this there were lots of phone_calls , emails & live_chat conversations held .
0	eventually wrote a long and rather strongly worded letter to their md mark cheshire , they gave_me 00_%_off ( ha not using that !)
0	and a written apology which has still not been recieved !
0	eventually got a refund after them having my £_00 for 0_weeks !
0	appalling !
0	i always book with hostelbookers .
0	it '_s a very good company .
0	initially i contacted a few companies about branded_usb_memory cards in boxes , and usb0u . co . uk were the most helpful and also spoke to me on a personal level instead of the auto generated / template emails that i received from other_companies .
0	the design progress through to delivery of the finished_product was very smooth and i will definitely be ordering another_batch when i run_out .
0	highly_recommended !
0	very pleased with better_bathrooms - this is now my 0rd purchase and happy with customer service , and also the correspondance from delivery driver .
0	i use cewe_photobooks for wedding_albums for clients - i have been very happy with the quality and turn_around .
0	however , the most_popular cover option is the ivory linen and i would like to be able to offer photopaper as an option - unfortunately if they don_'_t start offering more options ( photo_paper and glossy_paper for the faux_leather and linen covers ) then i will have to look for another_supplier .
0	otherwise , they are have good customer_care etc
0	as soon as i paid for the key it was ready to be used for the game thanks and will use your service again a ++++ :)

0	do not order from them !!!
0	i have no idea how the hell they have even one good review and now i suspect they are actually doing fake buys them selves to be able to create what looks like real buyer reviews .
0	they take your money and i waited to 0 to 00 working_days for my item .
0	it is now 00 working_days and no item , have emailed them 0 times and no response what - so - ever !!
0	!
0	i have told them now i want a full_refund and my order cancelled !

0	i am now having to put in a claim through paypal and by the time i get my money back it will be about 0_weeks since placing the order and no sunlgasses !
0	!
0	the total_lack of customer service says to me that if anyone does get their sunglasses from them double and triple check them because i would definetley guess at them being fakes !
0	i mean they say one of the places they get stock from is china .
0	need i say more ??
0	?

0	will definitely be using again once i '_ve got through this order !
0	i '_ve bought from deramores on a few occasions now and i '_ve been able to find what i wanted at a good price and received my order quickly .
0	all my goods have been good quality and i '_ve no_complaints - even when i ordered a pattern leaflet this arrived in perfect_condition .
0	i would recommend deramores to everyone .
0	i love their emails too with the deals on selected wools , inspirational pictures ( which led me to purchase a pattern book ) and the free pattern downloads .
0	i '_ve nothing_negative to say - a great company !
0	i always use the same old_fashioned perfume which is not always easy to find & it '_s really expensive even in duty - free .
0	i can '_t remember how i came_across cheap_smells but i '_ve always been able to get a bottle at a really good price and it '_s delivered within a couple of days usually .
0	i would highly_recommend this website - this time i bought sun_lotion as well .
0	simply_acer had the model i wanted at the best price .
0	i ordered it , choosing the cheapest delivery method and it arrived within a couple of days .
0	would not_hesitate to highly_recommend this company .

0	fab service got everything i was looking for in just one click , i will_defo uses jacinabox agan and my 0 year_old_son was so happy for his 0th_birthday thanks
0	i had been mislead on wowcher , i ordered some hair extentions under the impression that is what i was ordering , only to find out after i had paid £_00 , i had only brought the ' wowcher '.
0	i have emailed them asking for a full_refund and still no reply .
0	i am considering taking further_action if i do not hear i response soon .
0	phoned up for a quote on multi city flights to america next june and was put through to rosanna byers !
0	i was sick of looking on the internet and going round in circles !
0	after asking what i was looking for , she asked if i would like hotels as well .... something that i did not even think about !
0	i gave her all the information on what i wanted , where i wanted to stay and for how long .... within 0 hours rosanna emailed me an amazing holiday and within 0 hours i booked !
0	rosanna went above and beyond , very friendly and within 0_weeks i have booked and paid for my holiday , has all confirmations back and receipt .
0	will definitely be contacting rosanna again .
0	i cannot thank her enough for all her hard efforts ... she is a credit to the company !
0	brilliant service and very quick delivery , can '_t fault them 0_stars .
0	ordered some products on the friday - delivered on saturday ( next_day ).
0	very efficient .
0	no extra price paid for fast delivery .
0	ordered the new tunnels for my hamster_cage over the easter_bank_holiday .
0	i was very surprised to receive it very promptly after the bank_holiday .
0	all correct parts in excellent condition .
0	very prompt delivery and service ( received emails about updates of my order ).
0	will definitely be using this company again .
0	you rock !
0	i wouldn_'_t buy from anywhere_else online .
0	great experience though i was a little baffled that they charged me £ 0 for the short_stay parking at luton .
0	surely they need to factor this into the original booking price , clearly mention when booking or pick_up where there isnt a charge .
0	this website is amazing , really good value and all styles in line with current fashions .
0	i will_continue to shop_here .
0	easy to book and we were kept well informed prior to traveling .
0	all required details for our stay were provided .
0	we would use this company to book again :-)
0	they will take your money , tell you the product is out of stock , then fail to deliver a refund despite_numerous_calls and emails .
0	tomorrow i '_m starting a dispute for the transaction with my bank , and have let a couple of consumer watchdogs know given the huge_amount of reviews online saying the same things .
0	i have used mazuma a couple of times_now , with no_problems and always prompt payment .
0	i would definitely use them again .
0	i '_m planning my trip and the hostelbookers is being a wonderful help !
0	it '_s easy and quick to use !
0	love energy_savings helped_us get a great deal on our energy and the process couldn_'_t have been simpler .
0	their helpful representative was friendly , knowledgeable and incredibly helpful .
0	would definitely recommend them to anybody looking for a great deal on their energy tariffs .
0	after_reading some of the reviews for the website , i was a bit_wary_about ordering a perfume from there .
0	they said that the quality of the products were reflected in the price i . e .
0	they were poor quality and did not smell like the perfume they claimed to be .
0	fortunately , there were more positive_reviews than negative so i took a gamble and placed my order .
0	i didn_'_t need to contact customer_services but i was very pleased with how quickly they dispatched my order and how fast it was delivered .
0	in my case , the delivery arrived on the third day after dispatch , which was actually a day earlier_than they had stated .
0	when the package arrived , it was very well_packed and the perfume box was new and unopened .
0	i have bought this perfume before ( offline ) and this one smelled exactly how i remembered and expected it to .
0	overall , i am very pleased with my experience with this website .
0	searching for products was easy and placing an order was quick and simple .
0	i would definitely recommend using this website .
0	the prices are a bargain but there are no strings_attached !
0	p_&_p for standard delivery is also included in the price - result !
0	the site gave_us lots of options and made it easy to find the best place for the best price .
0	i love my australian_gold moisture lock moisturizer so when it runs_out its a sad day , i always try to look around to find the best price so i can save a few_pennies .
0	by far its the cheapest at fragrance_direct which is why i '_ve brought it from here before and will_continue to buy it from here until they no_longer stock it !
0	it comes pretty soon after you '_ve ordered it which is always a plus so if i '_m at the end of a bottle without realizing and it '_s my last bottle ( i always buy 0 at a time ) i can order it and know i '_ll have it within a few_days even with buying the standard delivery .
0	couldn_'_t ask for more as its quick , easy and a brilliant price !
0	i find the website as a great source of wholesale closeout and clearance deals .
0	easy to contact sellers , no strings_attached just like other_websites .
0	very helpful customer service .
0	arrived soon after i sent my phone website was easy to follow overall was an easy way to get_rid of my old phone !
0	!

0	very happy with the service and outstanding quality , will be recommending you too all my friends .
0	you have made a bride to be very very happy .
0	thank_you so much
0	after weeks of searching the internet , reading_reviews and deliberating , i ordered the tv corner_unit , lamp_table and book case from the rustic range and 0_days_later they were standing proud in my living_room .
0	i cannot_fault the customer service i received from oak_furniture_land .
0	as soon as i ordered online i received email_confirmation of my order and could keep track of its progress on the website .
0	i received a phone_call about 0 hour after ordering to arrange delivery on a day of my choice .
0	i have been kept up to date on the delivery by text and email and was even given a 0 hour time_slot .
0	the delivery guys were fantastic !
0	i received a phonecall on the day to say when they would arrive , once here they asked what room the furniture was to be placed and gave_me a card with a phone number to contact if there were any_issues .
0	there are none .
0	all items arrived very well_packed , the furniture is beautiful and the buying experience hassle_free .
0	so thank_you to oak_furniture_land , i will be buying more very soon .
0	so happy that i found strongvpn because prior to , i had tried 0 other_companies and was online with customer service more than i was online watching shows and movies .
0	i '_ve only had to contact strongvpn customer service once , due to me uninstalling accidently and the chat rep had me back online in 0 minute !!
0	now that '_s quality customer_care !!
0	i '_m so happy that with strongvpn , i am now able to enjoy all my us shows while stationed in japan !
0	i ordered a book for christmas but it has never been delivered .
0	i complained and amazon immediately refunded me back .
0	i had to go and buy another present but i appreciate the speed of their response !
0	i ordered some flowers for international delivery for some special_occasions and the service and flower quality were excellent - my mum and friends were so surprised to receive such a big bouquet of flowers !
0	i bought a parfume for my boyfriend for christmas and i was really pleased : saved a few_pounds and the delivery was really quick .
0	i would recommend it !
0	i have been with orange for 0 years and they have provided an excellant service throughout .
0	much_better that any other service i have used .
0	would highly_recommend .
0	the item i ordered arrived quickly as usual .
0	also the service has continued to be excellant every time i use it .
0	would highly_reccomend this site .
0	all fine - packaging just way too_big for small item ; paypal option would be nice
0	this is very annoying .
0	another of these companies where you place an order , the money is withdrawn from your account and you wonder where your product is .
0	i ordered a pair of glasses , my account was debited and only because i randomly checked the order status , i saw that the glasses i ordered are not in stock and that it can take an indefinite time ' more than a month ' to get them delivered .
0	i find this quite impertinent as this company didn_'_t even bother to notify_me that the glasses are undeliverable !
0	i want my money back or a confirmation of an exact delivery date .
0	as i need these glasses urgently , i would actually expect some kind of indemnification as i have to place an order somewhere_else to get glasses and who_knows when i '_ll get anything from this company .
0	really friendly helpful staff .
0	i would recommend to anyone_needing a loan for whatever_reason .
0	we love this site .
0	we have some really happy , spoilt bunnies thanks to the excellent products sold by this company .
0	the price & quality of the goods sold is amazing .
0	we would highly_recommend to all of our friends .
0	0_* all the way .

0	i was looking for a reasonably_priced rash_vest and i found it straight_away !
0	not only this , there was great choice .
0	i will definitely buy from surf_dome again !
0	the most_important ingredient to my night out is skiddle .
0	tickets delivered on time everytime .
0	i '_d never considered using a cashback site before i joined_quidco - i didn_'_t_believe that you could get money for nothing and thought there must some catch .
0	but three years later i have earned_over_£_000 in cashback and have just over_£_000 to come .
0	i only buy from the most competitive sites and the cash_back is a nice treat .
0	quidco and their customer service have been excellent .
0	i '_m a premium customer and recently my sky cash_back was taking a long time to be confirmed - i contacted customer support and they authorised my money immediately - all £_000 of it .
0	as a premium customer (£ 0 a year ), i can request a phone_call or have an online_chat with an advisor .
0	i also qualify for faster paying cashback .
0	there are a couple of drawbacks - sometimes it takes upwards of six_months for cashback to be paid especially with time sensitive things such as insurance - but the timescales for payment are clearly_laid_out on the site .
0	occasionally , cashback does not track or it takes a long time to be paid but if you contact quidco they try to get it sorted_out asap .
0	i always check quidco when i '_m intending to make an online purchase and although it isn_'_t exactly money for nothing there is no catch .
0	used this site to book our 0 week inter - rail trip in summer 0000 , was so good and the hostels were sooooo great i used it for my trip to perth !!
0	!
0	i have been using this website since 0000 and have never been disappointed with their service .
0	their reservation system is trustworthy and quick .
0	they have no booking_fees like other_websites .
0	their prices for accomodation are usually cheaper_than hostelworld as well .
0	i received the bag for my phone the next_day after e_- mailing and received notiifcation of mazuma getting the phone the following_day and got the cheque a few_days letter - amazingly quick service and really easy to use - was impressed and would use mazuma again !
0	would definitely recommend and will be using again .
0	as documented in various_forums ( just google ' homefiresides '), this company is completely fraudulent !!
0	you will not receive your goods as the company went into_liquidation months_ago .
0	company also known as firesgalore .
0	avoid !
0	i found this out the hard way after paying them £_000 .
0	this was my first time booking with double0tickets and wont_be my last . i found the customer service staff very useful and friendly , was very easy and quick to book with . i got a great deal for my tickets and a first_class service .
0	i would recommend double0tickets .
0	thank_you x
0	thanks my engagement_ring is perfect !!
0	would never have got what i wanted for this price on the high_street !
0	the order process was easy and i was kept_updated all the way !
0	thank_you !
0	booked sun_transfers before my trip to amsterdam , picked_up and dropped_off on time .
0	great service , would highly_recommend
0	i have been in business for 0 years , i was selling high end cosmetics and skincare .
0	when i first started out i purchased a few memberships to wholesale sites and so on , i only found a couple of useful sources between all of them .
0	i have now switched to wedding products and have found several useful sources on this site just in my first visit .
0	i think the service is very good , they have a very large number of viable suppliers , it was definitely worth the membership_fee and i would definitely recommend it to others !
0	received a damaged parcel .
0	when contacted , they said they '_ll get back to me in 0 business days .
0	been more than a week , nothing !
0	contacted them .
0	customer service didnt sound professional enough .
0	rest must be good but then this was my first opinion
0	recently used this site .
0	great service and very genuine .
0	i recently ordered a new bed from land of beds and was so pleased with their level of service .
0	the ordering process was seamless , and their customer support and delivery service was excellent .
0	we also found them to be the lowest_price online .
0	00 / 00 from us , cannot recommend them enough .
0	best night '_s sleep we '_ve had in years !
0	was unsure at first as the branding makes it look like a scam .
0	e . g .
0	send us your gold and we '_ll send you a cheque .
0	yeah , sure .
0	the opposite was true , very impressed .
0	i think they should publicise what they ' re doing with the phones to be able to pay so well ?
0	was really pleased with my purchase from this website and the delivery was quick too .
0	will_definately be ordering from them again :)
0	so 0 of us have just come_back from a long weekend in marbella for our friends hen_weekend and it was the best weekend ever !!
0	we laughed the whole weekend !!
0	we used hen_heaven to help us out and they were brilliant !
0	they sorted_out our hotel which was in the perfect location of san pedro right next to a supermarket , taxi_rank and lovely bars and restaurants , they arranged our transfers and a spa day which was simply perfect !!
0	they were super helpful with any_queries i had , the whole_process was simple and stress_free !
0	marbella is beautiful we spent the whole weekend feeling like vips and because we went out of season we pretty_much drank for free all night !
0	puerto_banus is amazing !
0	the bars are great and the people are lovely !
0	cannot_fault a single thing and will be going back there as a weekend was just not long enough !
0	thank_you hen_heaven for making it such a momentous weekend !!
0	one we will ever forget !
0	my dress is what i believed it should look like .
0	it made me feel great and sexy .
0	i have worn it to a wedding and a cocktail_party and it worked well in both events .
0	i will be back to buy more and have shown your wed site to many others encluding brides and mother of the brides .
0	thanks shopindream for your quality , reliability .
0	my order arrived fast , it was well_packaged , will buy from viovet again
0	great prices , fast delivery from again
0	next_day delivery , great product , gave as presents , and everyone that got the product loved it so much , def would buy from again and again
0	if you want to work with a truly innovative , trustworthy and forward thinking team , then visualsoft is the company for you .
0	after experiencing many difficulties with our previous_provider , we made the move to visualsoft who provided us with the perfect website for our brand .
0	from our initial_meeting with rich himsworth through to our ongoing contact with our account_manager hester short , and pr manager sarah the development of our site was professional yet personal and visualsoft truly understood the need to retain our brand image .
0	we '_ve found that visualsoft are very forward thinking with their website add_ons , ensuring their brands are at the forefront of web technology .
0	it is great !
0	useful , easy and no fee .
0	i like !
0	beautiful rugs and great people ... cheers_guys !
0	xx
0	excellent choice of products at fantastic value .
0	delivery is always speedy and trouble - free .
0	was recommended to all beauty by a friend - and now it '_s me doing the recommending .
0	i love boohoo - and must buy from the site every_month .
0	there '_s so much choice and what '_s better , is the fact it '_s so affordable .
0	never had a problem with delivery or any of my purchases .
0	everything is always good quality too !
0	i '_ve been a 0 customer for almost four years .
0	or rather , my husband has as it was more convenient at the time to put the contract in his name even_though i '_ve been using it .
0	setting_up the contract was easy .
0	upgrading to a more_expensive contract was even easier .
0	i didn_'_t even need to speak to anyone , everything could be done online .
0	i was happy with the contract while i just needed it for phoning , texting and occasionally using the internet .
0	even when i went abroad , the roaming was switched on and it was all good .
0	until the next time i went abroad .
0	i was cut_off from the rest of the world for two_weeks as 0 had randomly decided to switch off roaming without telling_me first .
0	when i got home and managed to phone them they told me i should '_ve phoned to switch on roaming before i left even_though it worked last time i was abroad .
0	i don_'_t even know what their logic was ...
0	then the problems started .
0	i wanted to switch the contract from my husband '_s name to mine as it was getting annoying that he had to phone them everything i wanted something .
0	so we went into a 0 store .
0	i '_m not sure if the people in there are trained for anything_else than selling because they just told us to phone customer service , who on this occasion told us that it wasn_'_t possible to change the contract that easily .
0	we gave up .
0	one time i had a problem with my bill , when i '_d gone over my free minutes ( something they '_d previously notified me of by text but this time they neglected to tell me and so i accumulated a spend of over_£_00 instead of my usual £_00 .)
0	after a lot of very frustrating phone_calls they finally agreed to refund £_00 because they '_d stopped the notifications without actually telling_me they would .
0	i '_m not sure they ever did refund me though .
0	months past and after a lot of minor problems that all required lengthy and very frustrating calls to customer service , i finally decided to switch to another_provider .
0	so my husband phoned them from work ( as he '_s still the person named on a contract ).
0	after half an_hour ( of his work time ), they told him they '_d phone him back .
0	instead they phoned my mobile and left a message_saying i '_d been authorised to make_changes to the contract , could i please phone them back .
0	so i did .
0	it took five_minutes just to get through the pre_- recorded adverts and nonsense they '_d like you to know about before they even let you talk to a person .
0	( also , if they ' re closed , they still make you listen to all the nonsense before they tell you they ' re closed and when you should phone back ).
0	this guy then told me i wasn_'_t authorised to do anything , could my husband phone back .
0	seriously ?!
0	so my husband took another half hour out of his work time only for them again to say they '_d phone back .
0	he made sure they had his work number this time but they still managed to phone my mobile , only this time i had magically been authorised to do anything i wanted with the contract .
0	i told him to cancel it .
0	he spent litereally 00_minutes arguing with me about how i should stay , they '_d fix everything , they '_d give me a better deal , they '_d instantly change the name on the contract , they '_d give me more free minutes etc etc .
0	it took all the patience i '_ve ever_owned ( and a bit more ) not to swear and hang up on him .
0	he was so pushy and tried to put down the new provider i '_d chosen .
0	i even went as far as saying " i '_m_sure you can fix everything , but can you please just let_me deal with any_problems i '_ll get with my new provider and cancel my contract !".
0	eventually it turned_out i was more stubborn than him and his sales_pitch ( although he insisted he wasn_'_t from the sales_team and i was the only costumer who '_d ever been offered this amazing deal ) and he finally agreed to give me my pac_code so i could end my contract and take my number with me .
0	most frustrating morning i '_ve had since ... well , since last time i tried to fix a problem i had with 0 .
0	he said he '_d send me the pac_code within two hours .
0	i do hope this is the one time they keep their promise because if i have to phone them again i '_ll probably just throw my phone out the window .
0	also , if 0 reads this , please don_'_t contact me with offers of better deals or apologies .
0	i '_m not interested and i don_'_t want anything from you .
0	i just want to warn_people to stay away from you .
0	i '_ve been using redbubble since they first started and always loved it .
0	it '_s got a fantastic range of t - shirts , framed prints , stickers etc .
0	and although i '_ve only used the t - shirts and greetings_cards i can confidently say that if the quality in their other products is just as good , they '_ll be amazing as well .
0	unlike_some other_sites that have artists uploading their work ( such as zazzle ), this still feels friendly and personal and possibly because it '_s australian and not american , it '_s got a completely_different feel than some of the other_sites that essentially do the same thing .
0	their t - shirts are amazing .
0	i '_ve only ever had trouble with them twice .
0	the first was years and years_ago when i '_d ordered some tees for christmas and they got delayed but even before i noticed they were delayed , i '_d got a full_refund for everything i paid even_though they were still going to ship it all and i think it actually arrived just before christmas after all .
0	great costumer service !
0	the second time i had trouble was about a week_ago when i received a t - shirt with a blurry print on it .
0	they replied to my email straight_away and have already sent out a new one , hopefully non - blurry , free of charge .
0	apart_from that , i '_ve only ever had perfect t - shirts and perfect prints and although they ' re sometimes slightly more_expensive than getting something in a shop , you know part of it is going to the artist who you can talk to and send messages on the site .
0	this is absolutely the best place to get something awesome with amazing costumer service as well .
0	this is a ridiculous website .
0	i was looking for a cheap sd_card and found this website that had them so cheap it was hard to believe .
0	turns_out it was because it shouldn_'_t be believed .
0	it said shipping was free and the items would be ordered via_amazon '_s check - out system so i figured if amazon were involved , it was probably alright .
0	however , when i went through to check out , shipping was about £ 0 with an estimated delivery date about a week_later .
0	i decided not to use it and ordered my sd_card on amazon instead .
0	after much frustration i '_m finally sitting here with the angry_birds game i ordered as a present almost a month_ago just in time for christmas .
0	when i ordered the game at the end of november i pretty confident their 0 working_days delivery would leave me with plenty of time to get it wrapped up and sorted_out and when i didn_'_t receive the email to confirm it had been despatched after two_days as they said i would , i didn_'_t think any of it .
0	however , after two_weeks of not hearing_anything , i got a bit annoyed .
0	there was no reply to my first email .
0	or my phone_call to the office listed on the website .
0	after another week i complained on trustpilot because i didn_'_t want people to experience the same thing .
0	however , after another email to nicecans , they replied_saying they were very sorry and that they '_d been overwhelmed with how many orders they '_d got and they were really sorry that they hadn_'_t got in touch before .
0	as i am a firm believer in second chances , i told them to either make_sure my item arrived by the 00nd or give me a refund .
0	they told me they '_d post it to me the next_day ( as they '_d run_out of stock and were getting a new load delivered ).
0	i accepted that and received an update email_saying my item had been dispatched the day after .
0	today , the 00nd , my angry_birds game arrived in the post .
0	i doubt i '_d recommend nicecans to a friend or even use it again for something with a deadline , but i might try it at a less busy time ( with something cheap ) to see if they can offer better service when it '_s not christmas .
0	i was recommended to these_guys and it was a good thing i was .

0	i purchased a portable_dvd_player for my sister to put in her car for my niece .
0	as she is such a technophobe it sat in the box for three_months .
0	when she finally went to use it the screen was faulty .
0	it was another month before she told me so by the time i contacted wowcher they say it only has a three month_warranty .
0	despite me contacting them three_times , each time waiting between one and two_weeks for a response .
0	i am getting_nowhere they sold an out of box faulty product and they really couldn_'_t care less .
0	i wouldn_'_t recommend buying anything from this company .
0	their customer_care and after sales service is very poor .
0	really pleased with the personal service , speed and quality of finish on my frames .
0	paid_extra for special delivery as they were expensive discontinued fendi frames i had to source from the us .
0	i have a very high prescription so paid for super thin_lenses - very pleased with the cost compared to my local_optician .
0	would recommend and i will certainly use again .
0	quick delivery , very impressive .
0	goods were as_described .
0	you should see are baby in her outfit she looks amazing :)
0	thought the bottle would be bigger and thought they would of filled the perfume right up !
0	!
0	i dont_know anybody who doesn_'_t use this site prior to making travel_plans .
0	we all want to enjoy our holidays and get our money '_s worth so doing some_research prior to your trip is becoming more and more important .
0	fellow_travellers write_reviews on accommodation , restaurants and attractions .
0	on the whole , reviews are honest , to - the - point and highlight the pros and cons .
0	and some of them have got handy_tips for making your trip that little_bit easier .
0	the site is pretty easy to navigate once you are used to it , and best of all some of the establishments have got handy date booking search_engines that automatically submit your dates and bring up prices and availbility of various booking sites .
0	not sure how i used to live without tripadvisor to be honest !
0	i am a regular user and very happy with the actual online side of the site .
0	the site is great , easy to use and i normally use the collection option for my orders which is free .
0	i have collected from a variety of their stores and i have to say that the whole collection process is really painful .
0	a lot of the stores don_'_t have a dedicated collection desk so you end up having to queue at a normal till only to be told that they are too busy and you should go to a different department .
0	they really need to look into ways of streamlining this collection process at all of their collection stores to encourage people to use this method .
0	i have been using snapfish for about 0 years_now and havent had any complaints .
0	their site is very user_friendly , communication is brilliant , and the actual products are very good quality .
0	they also do regular special_offers on all_sorts of products and you can get some really good deals if subscribe to the newsletter .
0	if it '_s possible to give no stars i would do .
0	i ordered a dining_room set from their diningroomworld site .
0	it was stated that the item would be delivered next_day .
0	notified at the last_minute that they couldnt deliver .
0	i had to phone them to find out when it would be delivered .
0	told them i couldnt do week days and it would have to be delivered on a saturday ( which they wanted to charge me for !
0	after pointing_out it was their lack of fulfilment for next_day delivery and that i refused to pay the saturday surcharge , they agreed to cover this charge ) that was 0_weeks_ago .
0	for the last 0 saturdays i have patiently_waited for the delivery and nothing has arrived .
0	what an_absolute_joke .
0	pathetic service .
0	no communication .
0	it is shocking to think that a business that treats their paying customers like this is actually still in existance ........... now waiting for a refund so that i can buy this item from a company that actually wants my business .
0	excellent service and nice vehicles both_journeys .
0	driver was first_class from dalaman_airport ... even got ice_cream and water for free !!
0	company were very helpful when i had a change of hotel !
0	can '_t imagine you will find a better transfer company !
0	ordered very last_minute as i couldn_'_t find the products i wanted anywhere , came_across fragrancedirect - and although some items advertised on the site were out of stock i did find alternatives .
0	super low_prices , fast effective delivery - would certainly use again .
0	supplement_warehouse has tons of name brand supplements at amazing low_prices !
0	i am a poor college student and without supplement_warehouse i probably_wouldn_'_t be able to afford my pre and post workout supplements which are key for me to maintain a healthy life style !
0	the shipping_costs are low and they also have some great free_samples and giveaways when you order !
0	hostelbookers is easy to use , contains lots of photos and information about the hostels and makes it very easy to compare ratings against pricing .
0	being a budget traveller you want to get things as cheaply as possible but you also want somewhere close to everything and a hostel that has some atmosphere and good qualities .
0	this site makes that much_quicker to scan through whats on offer and with the map_view its quick to check locations
0	ok , so one of my orders from asos got lost on the way to me .
0	but after sending an e_- mail to asos customer_services i received a very fast reply to acknowledge that my order hadn_'_t been delivered and was told someone was looking into it .
0	after a week i '_d not heard_anything more so i e_- mailed asos customer_services again and was shipped out a replacement straight_away with the next_day delivery service .
0	thanks , asos !
0	i never normally_write_reviews but am so happy with the service i just had to this time .
0	the service was easy to book and they managed to fit me in the next_day :) booked for 0pm and andy was here dead on time !!
0	he was polite , chatty and competent .
0	exceptionally good customer service !!
0	tyres were much_cheaper_than_anywhere_else and having them done at home was much_better_than sitting in a garage reception .
0	i will definitely use this facility again !
0	first_class service and i would recommend to anyone !!
0	thank_you !
0	rachael , warrington
0	great prices - love the competitor calculator right next to the products .
0	had exactally what i wanted
0	as with every order i have placed with truffle_shuffle it has arrived amazingly fast ( next_day ) my new t - shirt looks amazing on and is a great fit and great quality - will be returning for more in the future
0	i ordered my lenses on tuesday and selected next_day delivery .
0	within a few hours someone phoned me from customer_services to advise that my type of lenses sometimes take a little_longer to come into stock but should be with me by the friday .
0	i was then contacted the following_day ( wednesday ) to say they were in stock and they were delivered on thursday .
0	brilliant service .
0	i ordered the product yesterday just before_midday and it arrived this morning by courier .
0	excellent service .
0	i recently tried optibac ' for daily wellbeing extra strength ' which support overall digestive health , immunity and energy .
0	my experiences
0	digestion : one of the things i hate about having to take so many different medications and painkillers are the affects they have on my stomach and digestion .
0	without going into too much detail my digestion has_improved so much since taking the probiotics .
0	my digestion over the last few_years has_been very erratic but after just a few_weeks taking the probiotics i am much more regular , which must mean my intestines are a lot healthier
0	immunity : it is very difficult to judge the effect the on my immune_system after just a month ( other than the fact that i haven_'_t had any colds or bugs ).
0	i believe it can only have had a good effect though ; my immune_system is very low so even a slight improvement would be a bonus .
0	energy : this is another area that i can '_t say 000_% if my energy_levels have improved , as due to my m . e they are very up and down anyway , and can be affected by how much i '_ve done in previous days , how many painkillers i '_ve had to take etc .
0	the only_thing i can say is that i '_ve had more ' good ' than ' bad ' days this month , but whether this is down to the probiotics or not is hard to say .
0	skin : this is the area that i '_ve noticed the biggest improvement .
0	i '_ve had eczema since i was a baby , although it is a lot better now than during my childhood , and i often have flare - ups .
0	my skin seems a lot calmer now , with fewer flare - ups and sore , red patches .
0	it looks a lot healthier , is less dry and it feels less itchy and sore too .
0	i '_ve not changed anything in my skincare regime over the last month , so i can only put the improvements down to the probiotics .
0	overall : brilliant !
0	i wasn_'_t expecting such a change so quickly .
0	i '_d definitely recommend this product to anyone who ’_s health and wellbeing needs a boost .
0	i would definitely recommend this company as even when i encountered a problem with my cartridge , the customer service was second to none with almost_instant messages of advice being sent and when i was unable to resolve the problem , a no_quibble replacement was authorised .
0	excellent
0	you sort of expect invitations to be good , but not great .
0	not with zazzle , these invitations definitely have a wow_factor to them .
0	the quality is spectacular , service was wonderful , what else could you want ?
0	seriously impressed by this website .
0	moving is stressful and costly - anyvan . com took all the hassle out of it .
0	it '_s so easy to navigate and get what you want - quickly and at a good price .
0	the van company i used was certified and had great feedback and rightly so - really really happy with the whole service .
0	would definitely use again .
0	recently booked our_honeymoon to south_africa with budget_air .
0	found the cheapest flights by far with better connection times to port elizabeth than others .
0	the customer service team were also very helpful and responded to my queries almost_immediately .
0	received my e_- ticket just minutes later and everything all sorted very quickly and efficiently .
0	would definitely recommend them to others .
0	i bought an explanar a few_months back for my husband as he was complaining_about not being_able to practise enough due to the poor weather .
0	he_loves it and is always on it .
0	we recently gave our 0_months notice to end our contract on our rented flat , and shortly_afterwards greene & co started to book viewings .
0	unfortunately almost every viewing request we '_ve received has_been for that day , not providing the 00_hours notice they are legally required to give .
0	i '_ve had 00 + conversations with the letting_agents and even made a formal_complaint to the head letting_agent about this , but they continue to ask to view the flat without 00_hours notice .
0	we are buying a property and often have confidential documents on display in the flat , so it '_s not appropriate for strangers to be in our flat without the proper notice .
0	i '_m at my wits_end with greene & co and have unfortunately had to lodge an official_complaint with the property osbudman over this .
0	putting a loved one into care is a very difficult , emotional experience to go through , but i wanted to write a review of care uk as they made what was a difficult time so much_easier .
0	from the person i spoke to on my initial_enquiry to the home manager everyone has_been fantastically helpful and incredibly kind over this difficult period .
0	i '_d highly_recommend care uk '_s care homes to anyone looking for care for a loved one .
0	jantiene and rupert bought my house within 0_weeks of our first contact .
0	they sent me my offer , sent round the surveyor and dealt_with the solicitors .
0	smooth and quick sale .
0	i found the nigel_o ' hara through google shopping and they were offering a fantastic deal on the watch i had been looking to purchase .
0	made my order on friday 0rd of jan at 0pm , but 00 days_later still_waiting for delivery .
0	website stated that the economy delivery would take 0 - 0_days once dispatched which seemed reasonable and inline with other site '_s economy delivery option .
0	unfortunately what the website didn_'_t clearly state was that dispatching times are snail pace .
0	i received an_email on the 0th_jan ( 0_days_later - 0 working_days ) saying my order had only just been dispatched !
0	now 0_days_later ( 0 working_days ) i am still_waiting for my order .
0	i have contacted customer_care about the speed of delivery and received an_email thanking_me for my patience , but no explanation as to why delivery was so slow .
0	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0	edited : i have now received a response to my customer_care enquiry letting_me know that my order will now not complete this week but next week .
0	i have advised them to cancel the order and refund me due to the unacceptable level of service .
0	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0	update_:
0	nigel_o ' hara processed my refund quickly and with no questions , but later reported my review on trustpilot .
0	i can see this is the case with many other negative_reviews and agree with the review who said nigel_o ' hara do not want people to know the truth about their poor service .
0	i would advise against using this site and have amended my star_rating according .
0	such a shame as they have an opportunity to step up with their customer_care and respond to their users on trustpilot / communicate order statuses clearly before it gets to the trustpilot stage and they are shooting themselves in the foot .
0	i was pretty nervous_about using this company based on other reviews , but they were offering the iphone_0s for £_00 a month with automatic cashback , so the deal seemed too good to refuse and i took my chances .
0	phone arrived the next_day as promised and everything was as it should be .
0	i had a bit of a struggle getting it to work and had no signal at all .
0	popped_into the vodafone store and they told me the sim hadn_'_t been activated , so if this is a problem for you try activating your sim .
0	so far no_complaints and would recommend .
0	hope i '_m not tempting fate !
0	i worked with atom00 last_year on a campaign and was really impressed with the service i received from them .
0	in the past i have worked with online marketing companies who use a lot of confusing language and don_'_t get great results , but atom00 were the complete_opposite .
0	they explained_everything they were doing clearly and simply to me ( not an online marketing expert !)
0	and improved the sales i was seeing through my site considerably .
0	they ' re also a very friendly company , which made working with them a pleasure .
0	i would recommend them to any business looking for a reputable online marketing agency .
0	easy website to use which gives you all the information you need and responds very quickly to your booking .
0	i sent two phones in september_0000 they told me for weeks they are waiting for parts , i had already paid them for parts which cost £_000 .
0	to go on the website today and see it has_been ceased is very worrying they have 0 new phones worth a total of £_000 .
0	i have emailed them thry said i will get the phones back and be reimbursed .. how true that is i dont_know doubtful !
0	!
0	ordered two ladies fitted organic t shirts and was very impressed with the speed of delivery , the print quality , and the t shirt quality - they are so soft !
0	a great shape too , though i '_m not totally convinced on the sizing .... the large only just fits me ( i '_m a size 00 ).
0	great product and service , thank_you .
0	just received my order and what can i say ..
0	i am very satisfied with it .
0	the ship time was short and they treated me great !
0	the service rep also had a very good recommendation which i followed and i love my new phone !
0	thanks !!
0	!
0	the product is great , the note is lovely .
0	found out the packaging is 000_% biodegradable , so am very happy !
0	their service was quick and efficent .
0	although many ppl have told me only request for cheques and dont give in your bank details as a payment_method .
0	i gave in my details & received a payment within the very next_day of posting it .
0	there is no scam , it is a trust - worthy site .
0	i '_m very pleased with the product i ordered which was a spiky massage ball .
0	it was delivered within a few_days .
0	i got what i expected , really good for relaxing muscles .
0	would recommend to anyone interested in massages .
0	i was able to book my hostel very quickly and with lots of knowledge of what to expect .
0	the reviews are easy to find ( which is important ), and i feel_confident that i will be staying in a good choice hostel .
0	the whole_thing took all of about 00_minutes , including browsing and payment !
0	how amazing are this company ?!!
0	even phones that are scratched are excepted , my company has benefited greatly from mazuma , i will always use this company .
0	trustworthy , honest and quick !
0	!
0	keep_up the good work !!
0	!
0	just organising my first big backpacking_trip for years and still , hostebookers , comes out top !
0	sorted me out when i started travelling at 00 , and they come up with great deals for solo travellers every time - recommended !
0	i ordered from cybercandy to treat_myself for my birthday , the only problem was choosing what to get !
0	i ordered on sunday and received my goods 0_days_later on a friday they dispatched on the monday .
0	i was amazed_at the range of products and the prices are very fair .
0	{ having visited a shop and also looking at amazon etc } cybercandy was the cheapest i found and went with them and my experience was not disappointing .
0	i was very happy when the box arrived - the box had nice_touches on it , a cybercandy robot and om nom nom on the box - little things like that make me smile and shows they put effort in what they do .
0	they even had multicoloured peanuts in which also made me happy !
0	fantastically packed and no_problems with any of the products i bought .
0	today i ordered and had problems with payment and emailed them and was very impressed with the response time - they managed to resolve my issue and help me out in a very friendly and prompt way within half a hour , not many companies can boast such a quick response time .
0	i will defiantly be using them again and again in the future - really good for gifts and getting products that are not sold in the uk .
0	i would { and have } recommend them to friends !
0	also their facebook_page is awesome and they hold competitions and giveaways - its nice to see a company interacting so well with their customers .
0	thank_you cybercandy !
0	had a problem with a delivery address this morning , was sorted within 00_minutes .
0	excellent service through there facebook_page .
0	never had a problem with the company , great prices , better_than royal_mail x
0	great communication via_email and text .
0	highly fast and efficient delivery service i only went for standard delivery late on a thursday_night and i got it saturday_morning .
0	was a great surprise when got text to say it was arriving today and it has made a very happy cat .
0	i ordered a large cat_scratching_post which was packaged well and easy to assemble .
0	it was exactly as it was described and looked on the website .
0	thanks i am happy to use this service again .
0	great service was next_day delivery without the extra_cost of paying for it .
0	got emails asking if eta was ideal so was reassuring .
0	thanks .
0	it seems a little weird at first to be buying something cheaper just by going through a website - we ' re so aware of being scammed nowadays - but you can check out how and why it works and you can pay with paypal for added_security .
0	you put your request in and an offer comes back - usually the same day - which will be better_than amazon ( i '_ve had a 00_% saving before ) and you can either choose to buy it or reject it or think about it for a while .
0	no_pressure , you either accept it or you don_'_t .
0	if you choose to order , your request is posted by well_known companies - i '_ve had asda and amazon amongst others - and it arrives as if you '_d ordered from them direct .
0	if anything does go_wrong there is a team on hand to help resolve your issue .
0	i '_ve never had to use them so i can '_t comment on that .
0	so you ' re saving money just by putting your request through flubit , why wouldn_'_t you give it a go ?
0	when my father asked for a ps0_game for christmas on the day of last posting i was filled with dread .
0	a quick online search showed simplygames to have the best price on the game including next_day courier delivery .
0	sorted .
0	the courier service was excellent , i could choose what day i wanted it to be delivered or specify it be delivered to a neighbour and i was given updates including an_hour_window to expect delivery .
0	excellent service and no need to worry_about a disappointed father .
0	my fiancé and i have just bought our_wedding_bands from marlows and they could not of been more accommodating and helpful .
0	my ring is a beautiful diamond set band that completely matches my engagement_ring and i had not seen a band similar throughout the jewellery_quarter .
0	my fiancé however visited_marlows with a design already in mind - margaret at marlows was fantastic !!!!
0	she went through various rings with my fiancé till he found the prefect fit in size , width and weight before assuring us they could put the design he wanted on to the ring that he chose !!
0	not only were they extremely_helpful but also quick and efficient as his ring would only take just over a week to do ( even_though our_wedding is not till next year )
0	i would recommend marlows to anyone !
0	!
0	i had never used this company before and first attempted booking my tickets online .
0	however , i had a few simple questions about the train line .
0	i walked to the beeston train_station today hoping that asking my questions in person would be the least frustrating and easiest_way to find answers .
0	unfortunately , i was completely wrong .
0	the blonde , 00 something year_old woman behind the glass window was rude , cold and frankly ... completely_useless .
0	as a 00 year_old student who has just moved across the world from canada to the uk , trying to find the easiest routes in the most effective and inexpensive way is very valuable to me .
0	regardless of whether this woman likes her job or not she could at_least put some effort into it .
0	it was a very unpleasant experience that i hope no one else has to go through .
0	i have always recieved fantastic service and value for money when visitig national_tyres .
0	the staff are always friendly and highly knowledgeable .
0	excellent hotel , well_worth the money !
0	handy having someone_else sort_out money .
0	spa day sounded great so we booked it , it was in a grubby hotel that wasn_'_t a spa it had tiny changing rooms which were dirty and smelly , pool was old and run down , jacuzzi was small and old , not big enough to hold a hen_party as only 0 broken un loungers !!!
0	food was expensive and not discounted as advertised , i was really embarrassed that people had paid for this !!!
0	party bus well this was something_else words can '_t describe what a rip_off it was .
0	first bar we were taken too was disgusting in everyday , you could almost hear the tumble weed as we walked in !
0	we literally paid £_00 for nothing !!
0	!
0	like many others , tried to sell an iphone 0 00gb , was originally_quoted £_00 and today they '_ve received and tested the phone and due to ' water_damage ' and a very minuscule mark on the screen that i knew about , they now want to offer me £ 0 . 00 for it !!!
0	!
0	i was well aware i '_d be offered less because of the mark , which is only visible on a white_background and doesn_'_t affect the operation of the phone , but £ 0 . 00 !!!
0	come on that '_s crazy !
0	and there '_s no water_damage to the phone either , loads of bollocks !
0	have rejected the offer and will be interested to see what condition the phone is in when i receive it back !
0	i had a similar problem with mazuma , but at_least they offered £_00 for it - still unfair but better_than envirofone !
0	i rejected mazuma '_s offer and went with envirofone cos i thought they '_d offer me a better deal but how wrong was i !
0	think i '_ll try selling my phone privately , i might actually get a fair price for it , esp as i had the phone for almost 0 years and it '_s still in working order !
0	really unhappy with mazuma - they offered me £_00 for my iphone 0 00gb , on receiving it , they inform_me they '_ve found a tiny yellow mark that '_s only visible on a white_background ( eg .
0	in the settings folder ) and therefore it '_s classed_as faulty and they '_ll only offer me £_00 !!
0	!
0	i understand a small drop in the price but i don_'_t think that warrants a £_00 drop in the price , i argued this point on the phone but they refused to budge !
0	i had been warned they would try to find a fault and offer less - to prove this point , on receiving this phone back , i checked it over - no yellow mark .
0	sold it through a competitor who happily paid £_00 for it !
0	and to top it all off , mazuma wouldn_'_t let_me post this review on their website , funny that !
0	they clearly only want good reviews on there !
0	definitely wouldn_'_t recommend , avoid at all costs !
0	have used moonpig for many_years and love that i can personalise the cards .
0	just found the perfect gift for my hubby for xmas after_searching every shop and unable to find anything similar .
0	love the reminders , i honesty would forget people '_s birthdays otherwise !
0	haven_'_t brought from a card shop in years !
0	i have been doing online shopping since i '_ve had my two boys .
0	so much_easier than going in store with them both being under age 0 . can do it from home and be delivered .
0	always on time and there products are always good .
0	never had to send anything back .
0	and love the points rewards !
0	the online website is so easy to use !
0	and love how it saves my favorites , from online and instore !!!!
0	!
0	have sent a couple phones in and have been very happy with mazuma .
0	very fast and easy !
0	this company has a good range of products at very reasonable_prices .
0	i ordered late on saturday_night and had my order by tuesday .
0	would recommend and definitely use again !
0	was very happy and satisfied with my purchase from preciouslittleone and cannot wait to use my obaby zezu travel_system when our baby arrives in may .
0	would definatly recommend this company to others and will be purchasing items from them again .
0	really pleased with service and the product is brilliant !!
0	a big_thumbs_up to this company
0	i enjoy supplementwarehouse because they have quality products at prices much_lower_than other competing stores like gnc .
0	the option to pricematch any site makes it an affordable option for most everyone .
0	it '_s very easy to use and i recommend it for those looking to save a little extra_cash while still buying the same great quality brands .
0	i spoke to samantha who was very helpful and clear with her answers .
0	great site , will be using again
0	i have bought several items from here and been completely_satisfied with the service and the goods delivered .
0	being new to biking the reviews on the website are very handy .
0	and just like that , reservations were made .
0	great site , easy - to - navigate design , helpful reviews , and no sneaky booking_fees lurking in the corners .
0	0_stars fully earned .
0	courier picked laptop up on tuesday , got paid the exact_amount_quoted on the wednesday .
0	brilliant service , would use again .
0	switched gas supplier from npower to sse in august last_year .
0	npower put an estimated reading on my final_bill that was much higher than my actual reading .
0	i have spoken to them about 0 times_now about this and i still don_'_t have an amended bill .
0	every time i ring their call_centre the wait time is around 00_minutes .
0	it '_s now march of the year after and this is still not sorted grrrrr !
0	just wanted to say im a big lover of amazon , excellent products , great prices , helpful customer_services .
0	but i have also been very impressed with amazons kindle store recently when shopping for books .
0	they have a vast_selection and found some great reads for free also .
0	amazon just keep getting better and better , and if you haven_'_t purchased anything from them before , i would definately recommend them all the way .
0	:-)
0	primark you simply are the best , had a good look round primark this week , and the products , particularly ladies fashion are shoes are just so bang_on trend and really good quality considering the prices are so low .
0	obviously being a women i just had to buy something , and bought a lovely denim waistcoat with little pearls embellished all over it .
0	its so cute and will go with lots i currently have in my wardrobe .
0	i now it sounds crazy but my wardrobe would be very dull if there was no primark .......... primark is the fashion savior to savvy shoppers ..... i love u primark :-)
0	i recently bought a new laptop , have been shopping around for some time for a particular_model .
0	i then found it on special_offer in argos reduced by £_000 .
0	so was made up and went to purchase it immediately .
0	the staff were very helpful , and i was able to either spread the cost over 0_months or pay it off after 0_months .
0	overall i was very happy with the service , and probably would not have been able to afford this laptop otherwise .
0	well_done argos .
0	:-)
0	sell your laptop were great , i couldn_'_t fault the service one bit .
0	right from the start when i entered my laptops details into their very easy to use quote estimator , right down to them collecting my laptop free of charge , when it was convenient for me .
0	and finally receiving quick message to tell me what my laptop was worth .
0	i got a great price and received the cash straight_away .
0	all_round a super company , and i '_m very glad i choose them .
0	they were so good i even recommended them to my sister and her boyfriend , who then used sell your laptop also .
0	this place beats any other place hands_down !
0	i will never buy from another site .
0	the quality is great , shipping is fast !
0	and if i find the product online somewhere_else they instantly take 0 %_off the competitors price !!
0	i highly refer them to anyone looking to add any kind of supplement to their daily needs !
0	and if you don_'_t like what you got ( btw that will never happen ) they will refund you ' re money !
0	!
0	i stupidly didnt read the reviews before i placed an order for 0 x luxury hampers .
0	firstly , delivery was late so i called to check .
0	upon_calling i was told that there were ' delays ' and promised delivery would be the following_day and was told i could have a full_refund if not .
0	apparently they were delivered 0_days_later by which point , was too late for xmas as i mentioned on the phone .
0	we have no record of delivery and we have not recieved the hampers .
0	they are conveniently claiming that they have no record of the call in which i was promised a refund if delivery was any later - such a lie .
0	trying to get a refund but it '_s a long , painful process and emails were ignored for weeks .
0	in addition to this , they send far too many marketing emails which i find insulting given the service .
0	focus less on generating more orders until you can properly fufil your existing_ones .
0	great sofa_beds delivered next_day to aberdeen .
0	thanks
0	would definitely recommend to a friend .
0	great quality beds at a great cost .
0	arrived when they were supposed to and are very comfortable .
0	safe payment through paypal but peter accommodated me by taking my order over the phone as i don_'_t have paypal and didn_'_t want to send my card_details over internet .
0	good communication - phone_calls always straight through to the company director himself .
0	would love to buy the whole shop .
0	stunning quality products and great customer service
0	ive been using this company for a while now as i simply dont trust royal_mail .
0	my parcels get there quickly and they are value for money .
0	i recommend to everyone .
0	i made a typo_error and a pop up screen appeared and i was able to contact andrea who resolved the matter in minutes .
0	i will_continue to keep using parcelto go for all my shipping needs xx
0	we never thought we would have got the tickets that we did with double0tickets !
0	when we found them , we ordered them without_any hassle at all ; and they were delivered promptly , on time and with no_problems .
0	that '_s exactly_what you need in a ticket company and double0tickets has it !
0	gemma and martin thorne
0	i found hostelbookers . com to be a great website .
0	after_comparing_prices with other ho ( s ) tel booking websites it had the best offers .
0	the site is easy to navigate , use , place bookings , plus no booking charges !
0	one minute after i placed the order and had to call a hotel ( for visa - related questions ), they already greeted me by name from the booking they received through hostelbookers . com !
0	it was a pleasant_surprise .
0	without_doubt the worst company i have ever dealt_with .
0	i purchased 0 large bags of dog_food from this company and after using the first one ( which took a couple of months to get through ) opened the 0nd to find it mouldy .
0	i contacted feedem ( within the 0_months my consumer_rights allow ) and told them i had cleared the food out as it was a h_& s issue in my house ( as i am legally allowed to ) but sent photographic_evidence of the mould .
0	i was first told this would be replaced but then received the most disgusting email from them calling me irresponsible and pretty_much telling_me it was my fault the food was mouldy and that i couldnt prove otherwise ( my consumer_rights state that i do not have to prove it was fault0 ).
0	i contacted them again clearly stating my consumer right and was ignored ( up to 0 times so far ) so got my local citizens_advice to contact them - again they made out i was in the wrong ( changing the reason they were refusing a refund !!).
0	i have spoken to consumers direct who have assured me i am in the right and am_currently in the process of submitting a case to small_claims court .
0	i would recommend that online shoppers do not touch this company with a bargepole as my experience with them has_taught me this .
0	the proof of a company with good customer service is not in the prices on offer or how quickly things get delivered , but in how they deal with customer complaints - poor poor poor service ( a search of other online reviews demonstrates i '_m not the only one who thinks so ).
0	i would give 0_stars if the review allowed it .
0	great selection and choice of fancy_dress items .
0	easy to use website and fast delivery .
0	would recommend them to anyone who is in need of costume for an event .
0	will definitely use them again !
0	never_experienced that cs_team is closed for lunch , this is most bizarre since other customers can call only during these times .
0	managed to speak to cs representative who quickly helped to respond to one part of my enquiry to my satisfactory .
0	partyrama advertises free delivery over_£_00 , but it doesn_'_t work automatically and is not clear on the store delivery or checkout pages .
0	i have missed it and only wanted to suggest some improvements but have faced negative side of cs_team .
0	site requires improvement and cs_team could be more helpful when people provide suggestions .
0	needed a printer in a hurry - found a printer with what i needed very quickly on the website and it was the best value around !
0	arrived the next_day as promised .
0	great value , great service - very grateful !
0	i am still_waiting for a refund that i was promised 0_weeks_ago that should have taken 00 days maximum !
0	i have sent yet another email today in order to get my money back .
0	i ordered , on the 00th_december , 0 bunches of flowers for a special_occasion .
0	one bunch of flowers arrived a day late , half_dead and looking nothing like i had ordered so we refused the delivery !
0	the second bunch of flowers has never appeared !
0	i sent countless_emails over the christmas_period asking for someone to get in touch as it did not mention anywhere on your website that you would be closed ( i assumed that was the case as no one has explained this to me !)
0	i finally got hold of someone on the 0th_january who promised a refund within 0 - 00 days .
0	i called again on the 00th day as i had received no refund !
0	i was then told it would be this week .
0	i still_haven_'_t had a refund !
0	!
0	i am absolutely_furious , i am a first time customer and so far your ' customer service ' has_been diabolical from_start to finish !
0	i will never use your services again , nor will i be recommending you to anyone i know .
0	thank_you so much for the beautiful wedding_stationery .
0	we ordered the whole purity range and were absolutely_delighted with the quality and style .
0	the ordering process was straightforward and the service we received was excellent .
0	many_thanks again .
0	the surgery was a success for me so i am so pleased with the result , i feel like i can see perfectly .
0	my vision is even better_than if i was wearing my glasses .
0	the staff at optimax southend were ever so helpful in answering any_questions i had , they went into detail about the different_types of treatment that were available and we found the right one for me .
0	the procedure_itself was so quick and painless .
0	i was all back to normal the following_day but with better vision .
0	my aftercare was great too couldn_'_t have asked for more .
0	thank_you :)
0	it was quick and easy dealing_with them , and next_day special delivery .
0	i was panicking that i wouldn_'_t receive my tickets on time but they reassured me and now there in my hand 0weeks for the show .
0	thank_you so much , i will be dealing_with you again .
0	0 . 0 x
0	i had booked several hotels via their website and will do so also in the future - very relevant content , easy navigation , plenty of reviews - all one needs to book the best hotel according to chosen criteria .
0	i only discovered play . com a few_months_ago and i '_ve placed several orders , each time very pleased with the goods .
0	highly_recommend it !
0	no one is too far to reach in this world anymore , thanks to skype .
0	they provide a fantastic service and i '_d just like to say - thank_you :_d
0	these are my fourth pair of mbt '_s and i '_m very pleased with all of them .
0	they are the most comfortable_footwear i '_ve ever_owned .
0	i live in them .
0	i have a history of lower back problems and this range does encourage you to adapt a better posture which leads to a healthier body / back in the future .
0	i highly_recommend the mbt brand and the results ( 000_% improved posture plus increased muscle tone in legs and bottocks ) speak for themselves .
0	:))
0	the site is so easy to navigate and has everything u need to decide on which hostel suits you best .
0	perfect !
0	!
0	very good quality items , arrived quickly and had excellent choice of colours / fabrics / style .
0	loved the fact i could have anything i wanted on them !
0	great x
0	they were prompt , professional and the towels are great .
0	they look really professional !
0	!
0	firstly very reasonable in regards to price .... i actually ordered the product somewhere_else than saw it on this website and canceled .... as it was so much_cheaper .....
0	quick payment ... very easy to use and good delivery .... will be using allbeauty website to regularly but my shampoo ....!!
0	!
0	very happy !!!
0	!
0	what a story .......
0	exactly the same as many others , ordered , heard_nothing , got no response ......... then i wrote on this site ........ then got a response , agreed on a refund ........... returned item ........ heard_nothing again ............ 0 emails later ......,,,,, and again heard_nothing !!!!!!
0	!
0	i don_'_t care my phone case was £_00 .....,,,, i have had enough !!!!
0	!
0	i want my ££££ back !!!!
0	!
0	in nov i stated my family were solicitors and i was going to
0	proceed with this case against nice cans , as from the weekend the case as been constructed and i will proceed to court in order to
0	close this company down .
0	i will update all events on this site !!
0	!
0	i bought a stokke_xplory v0 travel_system from winstanley '_s .
0	they have been amazing .
0	at first i ordered purple and then changed my mind to red after i had ordered this .
0	the customer service centre emailed me back within minutes of our phone conversation to say that they confirm the colour change had been made and ordered .
0	i knew the red one was on back order and i also received email_updates to tell me when it would be arriving .
0	when the pram arrived there was a fault with it and the hood was bent , whish is more to do with the manufacturer .
0	i emailed them in the evening and by the morning of the following_day , nicola from the service centre had already phoned me and sent me an_email to say she had arranged for swap to take place the next_day and a courier had been arranged .
0	you cant_fault their customer service .
0	they have been brilliant and i am very happy with our whole_experience with them .
0	my iphone 0 ( 00g , firmware 00 . 00 . 00 ) locked to rogers canada is finally unlocked !
0	i tried to unlock the phone for weeks and got super desperate ` cause nothing worked .
0	finally i decided to buy the unlock and it worked_perfectly !
0	thank_you so much for that !
0	ordered an equipment bag and other bits and was really pleased with the quality and how quick it arrived as well as being very well_packaged .
0	i will definitely use this company again .
0	thank '_s
0	plus de 0 ans que_je_suis cliente chez asos .
0	et_je vois le sav se dégrader au fil des années .
0	commande effectuée le 00 / 00 pour_une livraison annoncée le 00 / 00 ( option livraison 00h facturée à 00 €).
0	rien reçu le 00 / 00 et quand je relance le sav via_facebook , j ' ai un gentil message qui m ' informe que_je serais tout naturellement livré le 00 / 00 .
0	ils savent compter chez asos .
0	quand je leur explique qu_' en raison de contraintes personnelles , je_ne pourrais pas récupérer le_colis et qu_' il me faudrait une redirection , un autre gentil message me répond : " on ne fait plus ça m ' dame " !
0	bah oui , ils faisaient mais plus maintenant .
0	merci asos pour tant d ’ efficacité .
0	i bought 0 items , all replacements for bits i had run_out of .
0	to find my favourite mascara , which usually sells for £ 0 . 00 , to be sold on fragrance_direct at £ 0 . 00 , made me very happy !
0	the price savings range from getting £ 0 off of something to saving up to 00 %!
0	it will definitely encourage me to try new items .
0	definitely gives superdrug or boots a run for their money !
0	would recommend , and will definitely shop again
0	my sister booked my hen_do for me and the girls for manchester last month .
0	she gave_me a few quotes she had got from other hen companies , but funktions stood_out .
0	the communication with them was easy and informative .
0	we got regular_updates on how the booking was progressing and changing things in the booking was no problem to them .
0	the cocktail_making and meal was really good value , well_worth what we paid !
0	we had a great time and stayed on afterwards as the bar had a brilliant atmosphere .
0	we went into the printworks bars later on without queueing , which was great as it was raining .
0	our hotel was only round the corner so a short stagger to our beds was ideal .
0	whole_thing only cost us £_000 each , bargain !
0	we will def be using them again , probably next year .
0	i have bought 0 x replacement bowls for kenwood kitchen machine .
0	i received one bowl few_days_later and there was no invoice included .
0	we sent email to as sufficient response to ask what was happening and received automated email few_minutes later reassuring that my issue will be look at by 0ourhouse . co . uk customer service .
0	0_weeks_later and nothing has happened .
0	i sent another email directly to 0ourhouse . co . uk , one month later no response .
0	because i lost only about £ 0 so i am not interested to stress myself further than that so this is my response .
0	very disappointed with this company and will definitely never order again .
0	cheers to that .
0	great price , fast delivery , excellent customer service , no_problems with returns .
0	great company , i will shop again and will definitely recommend to friend
0	i think dealchecker is great as their weekly email newsletter includes some very cheap holiday offers .
0	they often include hotels and country side breaks in the uk too so i find that i get inspiration for my next holiday .
0	i would definately recommend it if you are looking to save money on your holiday
0	we used this payment service to collect money for a hen_party .
0	it made life_easier for everyone .
0	the organisers ( us ) didn_'_t have to chase attendees for their contributions ( as instructions were sent by email ) and it was very quick and convenient for everyone to make their payment .
0	i would recommend to anyone .
0	i have never_experienced worse customer service than with three uk .
0	i paid for internet , and they couldn_'_t help me get it working .
0	they kept telling_me they '_d send me the details i needed via_text , and they '_d never come through .
0	i spoke with over 0 different people and all of them were unhelpful and borderline rude .
0	now i asked for a refund , and they said they can '_t do a refund , but they '_d be happy to issue a credit to my account .
0	they said their system can '_t process refunds ( which is clearly a lie ).
0	i am just so frustrated - and am out the money i paid for a month , which is very frustrating since i didn_'_t even use the service !
0	switching cell services for sure .
0	i loved hostelbookers and i will definitely be using them again .
0	the site was so easy to use and they had the best prices i could find .
0	i choose to order flowers from iflorist to be delivered to a close family_member on christmas_eve as a surprise christmas_present .
0	i choose certain flowers as they had sentiment to the person that was receiving them .
0	after_reading bad_reviews for iflorist i ensured that i emailed them to confirm the order i had paid for .
0	yet after getting a phone_call from my close relative explaining she had received flowers i went round to see the quality .
0	to my shock and disappointment i found that not only had they sent the wrong free chocolates but the wrong flowers completely .
0	they seem to have provided me with a cheaper substitute to what i had ordered and it was pointless as the flowers were all the wrong_colour and not one of the flowers that were in the description for the product i purchased were correct , i am so angry that i choose to use iflorist on such a close relative to get flowers which have alot of remembrance of her late husband .
0	i would have got better quality and have more pennies in my pocket by nipping down to garage and getting a bunch from there .
0	angry , upset and disappointed !!!
0	season of good will - clearly not at iflortist ... getting the order correct would be a start !!!
0	also i found the support_team disinterested in the fact that my order was wrong .
0	i thought the preview section worked really well and liked the fact we could play with fonts and phrasing .
0	however , i received an_email on the 00st_january stating that my invitations had been dispatched and would be with me shortly .
0	a week has passed and i still have not received them .
0	how long does a parcel take from lancashire !
0	?
0	i have sent two emails and heard_nothing back .
0	at this rate the rsvp date printed will have passed !
0	becky
0	i have had three canvases from hellocanvas and i have been delighted with them all .
0	i would not_hesitate to recommend them to anyone and will be ordering again as soon as i find some free wall space !
0	!
0	not only did i manage to book my accommodation at a cheaper price through hostelbookers , and in no time using the easy booking_system .
0	i also had a print out of everything i needed including directions on how to get to the guest_house , his phone number and email address .
0	the next_day when i met some people on my bus from the airport , they mentioned how difficult it was to find their accommodation , especially as it was 0 o ’ clock at night and dark .
0	but , i found mine in no time , which as a female travelling_alone , it really helps .
0	thanks hostelbookers !
0	i will definitely be using you again .
0	i recently completed the complete_nail_technician_course in islington , london and had a great time .
0	the tutor emma was extremely_helpful and made the lesson enjoyable especially when going through the theory .
0	what i liked most about the course what the fact that we practised on real_life models ( other students ).
0	i believe this is an excellent way of learning as it enables you to get a real feel of what it would be like to work on a paying client , not only teaching you the theory and practical , but also client interaction .
0	i would highly_recommend this course for anyone aspiring to become a nail_technician !!
0	!
0	i found this to be the most cost_effective way to reserve a hostel .
0	the price was well below the cost at the door ( exactly half ) there were no service fees , and it was fast and easy :)
0	i shopped_around for a good price on a decent guitar bag for my son to take to school .
0	reidy '_s price was unbeatable and the service was quick and efficient .
0	i would definitely recommend .
0	thank_you :)
0	found barrington '_s had the best price on what i was looking for and was really pleased with how quickly i received the item .
0	would definitely recommend and highly likely to use again next time the hubby starts whinging for something !
0	:-)
0	cannot_complain at all .
0	the website was easy to use .
0	they kept in touch the whole time .
0	the courrier was on time and polite and it took them less_than 0 hours from when they received my laptop to payment being in my account !
0	i got more money than i thought and it beat the average ebay prices .
0	i would totally advise using this and its for charity too so warm and fuzzy all over !
0	thank u !!
0	!
0	my husband has_been part of ziip forum for several_years and up until now i have always gone on the high_street to buy his games but now with ziip having the best prices around and also buying points its definitely the place to buy games its a good way to support independent companies .
0	i have even started to recommend it to my friends who other_halfs play games as well .
0	very quick response and delivery to give the whole service 00 / 00 .
0	i '_ve just found a coat that my boyfriend wants for christmas ... an an amazin price of £_00 ...( rrp £_000 ... he wanted it that badly i was prepared to pay that !)
0	i '_m so glad i stumbled_upon this ... great sale !
0	ive ordered before ... unfortunately one of the poles to my tent snapped ... but i ent it back to outdoorkit and i was sent a brank new one within a matter of days .
0	great service ... thank_you .
0	firstly the website : not user_friendly , search for something using the filters on ebay and you '_ll see how a big site should function .
0	secondly the delivery : i '_ve had one delivery where they couldn_'_t find my house so kept trying to deliver it to another house on the wrong street .
0	another time , the express next_day delivery i paid for was cancelled on the day and i was reduced to super_saver .
0	talk about late notice .
0	i was left without an important present .
0	then it took_ages to arrive ( citylink dramas same old )
0	finally customer service : talk about not what they claim .
0	their call_centres are abroad and therefore explaining things is never easy , simply because the nuances of the problems are missed .
0	they never actually answer_questions in emails or on the phone .
0	they just skirt around the issues , unless you email the same questions more concisely three of four times .
0	i know they ' re a massive company and they brand themselves well , but if you ' re one of the cases where it goes_wrong , you quickly lose any love you had for them .
0	they ' re the same old dodgy corporation with a smiley_face on the box ( a bit like apple ...)
0	received my glasses very quickly as they fit through letterbox .
0	they felt a bit difficult to look through , so i rang ciliaryblue and jack was so helpful , saying i could send them back to him and he '_d check them and advising me as to what to say to my opticians , d + a .
0	he checked the lenses and they were as the prescription said .
0	armed with the knowledge that ciliary blue would replace lenses if my prescription was wrong , i went to see d + a .
0	they fobbed me off multiple_times , claiming i hadn_'_t given the glasses time and that websites are unreliable .
0	they constantly tried to lay blame on ciliary blue , which annoyed me immensely .
0	in the end they agreed to retest but if there was no change in my prescription i '_d be charged_£_00 .
0	i took the risk and discovered they had my axis wrong by 00_degrees .
0	pretty shocking .
0	needless to say i made d + a replace the lenses because i don_'_t think it would have been fair to get ciliary blue do it considering it was definitely not their fault .
0	one of the best if not the best internet based company i have ever used .
0	found exactly_what i wanted at a fantastic price and the added_bonus of being_able to nominate a delivery day !
0	why can '_t shopping online always be this easy ?
0	spent a long time trying to find a cotton cellular_blanket with a satin edge and this one is perfect .
0	excellent prices and very quick delivery .
0	will definitely be recommending , thank_you !
0	hostelbooking is very easy for everyone , you can find many hostels for a good price and all on one webpage .
0	furthermore the booking is not complicated and can be handled by everyone .
0	i would have to say if i need a supplement i will most def be able to find it on supplementwarehouse . com at the lowest_price .
0	not only have i found products i need but the site , i also get alot of great products to test that i ended_up liking and using .
0	i '_ve booked with them several_times and never had any trouble .
0	their rating_system helps me pick the best options and is pretty reliable .
0	i have resently purchased twice from guitarguitar and on both_occassions the service i have received has_been second to none , commumication is great and the staff have went out their way to do their best for me .
0	their next_day delivery service is amazing and by far the best .
0	i will_continue to purchase all my musical equipment from guitarguitar as they have never_failed me in the past .
0	just eat is an easy way to order food , there fast , reliable and sometimes people don_'_t have money on them so just eat made it easier to pay by card , i would recommend anyone to give just eat a go .
0	there fantastic , and i '_ve never had any_problems with this service .
0	can not fault this company .
0	the bike was brilliant and it arrived the next_day in perfect_condition .
0	i found the staff to be extremely_helpful and informative .
0	would certainly recommend !
0	superb .
0	always use it to check results ... just wonder_if a cashier checked and it came up with all the winning numbers if they would give the ticket back !
0	?
0	good website , but sales people in their shops are really bad and rude .
0	very unhelpful .
0	i shopped with them for years , putting up with the awful staff until i found the same products with other people at half the price
0	limited website and sales teams are a total pain in the backside .
0	once enquired_about advertising and now they won_'_t leave me alone
0	these people are geniuses !
0	celeb copies at cheap money !
0	was happy to find their site after i '_d paid 0x the price in a ' boutique ' for their products !!!
0	!
0	used to love this site , but does anyone use it anymore ?!
0	shame they couldn_'_t keep_up with facebook .. wonder where it went wrong ?
0	!
0	actually wonderful !
0	ordered a star for a friend who got it on time , a month later they delivered another , 0_months later another , 0_months later another until she had 0_stars !!!!!
0	!
0	they '_d not charged me , and when i told them they apologised and told me to throw_away the extra ones .. not that she did .
0	next time i '_m ordering a ferrari !
0	these people are simply geniuses !
0	my daughter had lots of bears , but never one she specifically loved ... she got one from here and because of the process where she made him , she never leaves anywhere without him !!!!!
0	it '_s amazing ... he '_s now off to get a girlfriend after xmas , is getting_married in march , will have a baby on her_birthday and the life of this bear goes on !
0	not to mention his furniture !!!!
0	!
0	they never have codes i want , when they do they ' re out of date
0	they used to be the place to go to if you wanted a last_minute holiday .... but now they ' re just as , if not more_expensive than a travel_agent .
0	total_waste of time .
0	limited hotels etc too !
0	easy to use , i booked with them and then found the room £_00 cheaper elsewhere ... luckily the hotel refunded the difference .
0	it '_s a great concept .. but , a few_years_ago they offered really good discounts on rooms .
0	which is why they set_up and their whole marketing_campaign .
0	now they don_'_t really offer any discount .
0	i use it to search hotels in the area ...
0	i have found better discounts on other_sites ...
0	it also has limited hotels and b_& b '_s ... considering i tried to register my bandb and they said i was out of their limit , even_though the place down the road is on the site only 0 miles_away !
0	they should accept everyone and go back to offering discounted rooms .
0	they ' re ok , but i enquired_about ' anytime upgrade ' and was sent an_email_saying i was able to have it , but ring the phoneline to sort .... rang phone line ... they said i wasn_'_t entitled ... someone , somewhere isn_'_t very familiar with their products and services !
0	very disappointing
0	good company and customer service ... but don_'_t always add on your voucher from previous 00_% shop guarantee
0	substituted an alcoholic beverage for one of a lesser quality , which if i '_d of bought elsewhere would have been £ 0 cheaper ... told me i could take it back to the store , which considering i was having a party and the order turned_up 0 hour before was totally un realistic .
0	offered no compensation , said he would inform the store and that was it !
0	never ordering from them again
0	shipping can be delayed ... which is frustrating .
0	cs don_'_t know a great deal .
0	pestered me for 00p when i '_d set_up direct_debit which they accidentally cancelled - damaging my credit_score !
0	said they would give me £_00 as compensation , and didn_'_t !
0	not impressed ...
0	i placed my order and within 00_hours they have sent me the email with the code i needed .
0	it ran_smoothly and i got just what i was looking for .
0	purchased my christmas cards again from goodprint - nice quality , easy to use website - quick delivery !
0	!
0	we have used the underfloorheatingstore now on three occasions and can not fault this company !!.
0	placing the order is simple , the emails and communication excellent and very speedy next_day delivery .
0	the products have been of a high_quality and very competitive in price .
0	i have already_passed on the details to a friend and will be back for sure !
0	thank_you !!
0	!
0	we ordered a tap from you and immediately got an_email to say the order was being progressed , another to say the tap was in dispatch and then on its way and the item is fabulous !- thank_you - we will shop again !
0	after much research we launched our new website with visualsoft in august_0000 and we haven_'_t looked back .
0	visualsoft are true experts in this field .
0	the design team are full of inventive and creative ideas , marketing is focussed and driven and all of the help and support that is available is unsurpassable .
0	the build process was thoroughly_enjoyable and visualsoft made it stress_free - nothing was too much to ask .
0	the website itself has enabled_us to increase our profits considerably compared to our previous site .
0	one of the joys of working with visualsoft is their passion for new ideas and concepts ; our old website was stagnant but with visualsoft on - side we are trying new ideas regularly which boost our sales and online presence .
0	i feel_confident that visualsoft wouldn_'_t let our site fall behind the times which can be a daunting_task when the world of technology moves at such a fast pace .
0	don_'_t_hesitate to work with this company .
0	chillisauce helped as to plan an amazing hen_do .
0	it '_s a knockout - the best thing ever !
0	so much fun ... laughs all_round !
0	accomodation - average but for one night it was ok .
0	they provided a nice breakfast in the morning .
0	q jump and guestlist @ oceana - all organised and fancy_dress was allowed .
0	i had a technical problem with a fresh wordpress installation and after having_difficulty working out where the problem was i put in a support ticket .
0	i was really impressed that when i logged on about an_hour later , not only did my ticket have a response , the problem had also been fixed .
0	i feel reassured that if i have a more serious issue in future that the support system is fast , friendly and effective .
0	ordered an aftershave arrived quickly and was the best price i had found would decently buy from there again
0	we were so pleased with our invites , such a brilliant company .
0	had a small issue with a couple of reply cards missing and wedding_invitations sorted within a few_days and sent me out extras such brilliant customer_services .
0	would recommend to everyone .
0	thank_you again :)
0	my husband and i have been using zleeps for some time now and we ’ re really happy with the service we get .
0	we started off with a mattress_topper and have since moved on to a divan_bed and a king_size mattress which has_been just great .
0	david , my husband , suffers from really bad joint_pain and he really feels this has_been improved since sleeping on the memory_foam_mattress .
0	it was a really great price too .
0	we had seen a similar model mattress in a local_store for double the price we paid with no real_difference that could be seen .
0	brilliant !
0	would recommend zleeps time and time again .
0	we were looking for an seo company in bristol and was so glad to find freelance seo bristol .
0	we had no idea where to start .
0	now we ’ re experiencing more traffic than ever before and we ’ re looking_forward to starting up a twitter campaign and adding a blog to our website .
0	don_’_t know how our business would have done without this help , but we ’ re certainly experiencing some great sales figures right now !
0	really well_organized , helped_us out when there were cancellations and made the weekend less hassle for all .
0	hi just bought scooter from this company . fantastic service , good value and really helpfull will be using again
0	ordered makeup_brushes and they were cheaper_than in stores which was great .
0	it was delivered in two_days and postage was free .
0	would definitely order again .
0	from this advice :
0	" i appreciate that you are going to be on an exchange in that case the best case may be to change the ticket you have to a refundable " off peak " or " anytime " ticket which you will then be able to claim back a refund on less a £_00 . 00 charge rather_than having you miss out on the entire ticket cost ."
0	" the best case may be to change the ticket you have to a refundable " off peak " or " anytime " ticket which you will then be able to claim back a refund on less a £_00 . 00 charge rather_than having you miss out on the entire ticket cost ."
0	to this :
0	" yes , by going through the change of journey option .
0	where you would change the ticket you have to a refundable ticket ( which you would need to buy )."
0	had finished a phone_call where the conclusion was that i was to send back the unused tickets for a full_refund ( minus £_00 in charges ) only to be phoned back saying that was a mistake , and it would be a total of £_00 charges , along with me buying new tickets .
0	consistently ignoring the information provided in the phone_calls and emails , like the fact that our outbound_journey dates had been changed .
0	ongoing .
0	i love everything for £ 0 it is excellent first i was unsure but as i have been buying i am impressed expressly with the shoes
0	i am very satisfied with the order money and how long it had taken to get to me
0	living in ireland , i am always looking for sites based close to home so i don_'_t have to wait weeks for delivery : i ordered a wacom intuos0 tablet , and got a great deal - the tablet was even cheaper_than ordering directly from the wacom site .
0	with the money i saved , i covered shipping ( which is a handy flat rate ) and extra insurance for the product .
0	after my order was dispatched , i recieved an_email_telling_me my package would arrive between the 00th and the 00th of january - it arrived on the 00th completely intact and pristine .
0	i would definitely order from pixmania again .
0	booked return transfers in bratislava , well what can i say 0_star service from booking transfers to being picked_up by very friendly staff .
0	drivers were friendly , smartly_dressed and arrived on time .
0	would definitely use again and recommend to friends .
0	my partner and i had a fancy_dress_party to go to so we picked out two costumes and paid_extra for next_day delivery .
0	when the costumes arrived they had sent completely the wrong product .
0	after ages spent trying to get their " customer service " on the phone i was instructed the product ordered was not in stock ( thanks for letting us know !)
0	and to go out of my way to send them back the wrong item by next_day delivery ( otherwise no refund !)
0	the party coming up very soon i had to quickly pick out a different costume with the promise of next_day delivery .
0	however the next_day having arrived and you guessed it no costume .
0	below_par service on every_single principle a business should be run !
0	my advice ?
0	avoid !
0	highly impressed with not only the professional way my ( multiple !)
0	queries were dealt_with but also the finished_product - my banner and stand look excellent and at such a bargain price !
0	will 000_% use kituout again - thanks !
0	my friend and i booked this hostel due to its high rating and it has exceeded my expectations .
0	sparkling clean , huge rooms and lots of space , and staff willing to help in a cancelled bank card crisis !
0	we love it so much we have booked an extra night for the end of our stay .
0	trustworthy .
0	fast delivery .
0	good product .
0	this way of hiring is brilliant , they call u back to confirm ur driving_licence details then u collect the vehicle !
0	collecting is easy !
0	definitely worth use and worth the money , cutting out t middle men is always good !
0	would use again in the future !
0	this was a great company to use , flowers were lovely and made the perfect gift .
0	paid_extra to get delivery before 0pm .
0	would defiantly use again !
0	very happy with the service of refurb phone .
0	handset arrived quickly and is in great condition as_described .
0	would use again
0	great service with super_fast delivery .
0	couldn_'_t be_happier with my rucksack .
0	would definitely choose to use this company again .
0	fantastic service , speedy delivery and goods arrive in perfect_condition .
0	definitely worth the discount and saves you money !
0	very comfortable durable sofas
0	this is an excellent alternative service for those sellers that are motivated to sell their own property .
0	housenetwork '_s online ticketing system , process and methodology meant that the whole_process was efficiently managed , from viewings , feedback and follow_up through to completion .
0	i had a direct line to my adviser , ashley elley , who was very accessible / responsive , friendly and proactive .
0	when called upon , he gave good advice on tricky situations .
0	i was able to fit in more viewings than a high_street agent would and so was able to sell my property in half the time it took similar properties that went with a high_street estate_agent ( who are juggling 00 - 00 properties in their portfolio a week ).
0	i will never use a high_st agent again .
0	the ones that came to do a ' valuation ' were expensive , often misleading / tried to pull the wool over my eyes and did not have as good a knowledge of my property / block as me .
0	they didn_'_t have my best_interests at heart and would have cost me £ 0 - 0k for their ' service '.
0	online estate_agents are the way forward
0	a bit_pricey but you get what you pay for and then some , so well_worth it for me .
0	i was looking for a hassle_free way and i found this website i have purchased an unlock for my brother '_s iphone0g and one for my iphone0 .
0	the phones have been updated plenty of times to the latest firmwares and are still unlocked and being enjoyed .
0	i currently got a hold of an iphone0s from a friend and purchased an unlock for it i can '_t wait for the unlock .
0	we as a family have enjoyed the holidays we have gone on with blue_chip .
0	this is a stand_out company .
0	samples received within less_than 00_hours with no postage cost and the tile order was delivered as planned on a pallet by a driver who phoned to tell me what time he would be there .
0	i didn_'_t deal with tile_mountain on the phone , but i didn_'_t need to .
0	my builder was impressed with the price of the tiles as well .
0	i would definitely use tile_mountain again and have already_recommended them to other people .
0	i have to say that the service i received from the support_team was faultless .
0	quick , clear and helpful replies , even if just to say they received my response and were escalating it to the appropriate team .
0	best customer service experience i '_ve had in a long while .
0	thanks !
0	lets be honest after ordering my ring i did spend a few works wondering_whether or not the site was going to disappear and my money also .
0	i had nothing to fear !
0	the ring and the delivery were just as exceptional as the help i received from the site in choosing the all important engagement_ring .
0	i would recommend this site to anyone !
0	great savings and great advice .
0	i will be coming_back for the wedding_bands :)
0	thanks
0	as with others , i ordered the big_boy beanbag on 0th_november as a christmas_present for my daughter , delivery date of week 00 which has just been put back until week 0 !
0	furious .
0	very bad service !
0	i love how lighthearted and fun truffleshuffle are , they even put a sweetie in with my order !
0	thanks wolverine :)
0	the flowers themselves were a present for my mums_birthday , she loved them and the bright_colours , however as i was the one who saw them online i was a little disappointed with the size , very small for the price but like i say mum_loved them and didn_'_t know the difference !
0	all_round excellent service .
0	would recommend to everyone
0	the item i ordered arrived quickly and was at a fantastic price compared to other online companies i looked at .
0	would definitely recommend using facewest .
0	the stay was pleasurable from_start to finish .
0	it was brilliant .
0	we were greeted_by lovely friendly staff who constantly offered us help , advice and a good time .
0	i also wasn_'_t aware of their new 00_mins free wi_-_fi which was the cherry on top .
0	comfortable_beds , friendly staff and good food .
0	couldn_'_t ask for more .
0	quick to help and are very friendly and helpful and will stand no_nonsense .
0	rose really helped_me .
0	thank_you !
0	i found menkind brilliant to order from .
0	they have unique products for good
0	prices .
0	their deliveries are very fast and well_packed .
0	would absolutely recommend .
0	i love topcashback .
0	it is an excellent website and it '_s definitely a must to go through for online buys .
0	also , when i '_ve had to have customer support the service has_been friendly and very helpful .
0	all_round excellence !
0	ordered ghd '_s yesterday , arrived today .
0	low price .
0	great service :-)
0	i filled in the form online .
0	then in the post 0_days_later my pack arrived .

0	i walked in and was greeted_by a sales_man who showed me the car i was looking for , i had an_instant test_drive , my car was absolutely lovely , i bought it there and then and arranged to collect a few_days_later !!
0	job_done !
0	fabulous service and my car is great
0	x
0	you can find everything on google , i get free advertising on google , there is hardly anything i do not use google for on the internet , love love love it "!
0	the website is really easy to use and find what you need , many different options .
0	i like that in the map_feature you can see the prices of the places as well , which you can '_t on some other_sites .
0	i just wish they had an app so i could take them with me easier when i went away !
0	the school itself was good .
0	staff was well prepared .
0	managing team also organized after - class activities and some parties .
0	i recognize this schools as a great place to become a professional bartender .
0	however personally i found some drawbacks : firstly , it '_s way too expensive given the fact that the school is set_up in phuket , thailand ; secondly , learning tools such as flairing bottle and starting bartender '_s kit was ridiculously_expensive ( it '_s possible to get all the stuff online more than twice cheaper !!!
0	); thirdly , student were not allowed to practice flairing with school equipment and were forced to get flairing bottles from school .
0	wherever we travel we always book with hostelbookers .
0	there '_s no booking_fee , it '_s easy to book or cancel .
0	we traveled around_europe , south_east asia and we have just booked our first accommodation in cuba .
0	i feel safe to book the rooms as there '_s everything i want to know : reviews , pictures , maps and what is provided .
0	the booking is really easy and if we want to stay closer to the center then just click on the map option .
0	would definitely recommend the site to everyone .
0	safe trips and sweet dreams !
0	i was already disgusted with this company as they failed to deliver my order on 00nd_january and didn_'_t respond to my complaints until 00th_march .
0	however , my disgust has only increased after finally seeing the flowers which were delivered to my friend yesterday .
0	most of them were dead on arrival ( and there weren_'_t very many altogether anyway ), and it looked more like a cheap bunch of flowers from a petrol_station than what the picture suggests it should turn into .
0	i will now do my utmost to make_sure that no - one i know gives a penny to this company - i am ashamed to have sent my friend such an awful ' gift ' for her_birthday .
0	bought rainsuits for my husband and 0 brother in laws .
0	used discount_code so got them even cheaper .
0	we were all impressed with the quality especially at such a low price , will_definately use again
0	contacted parcel 0 go on serveral occassions for help and emily was the only one who clearly_explained and helped_me to resolve my issue !!
0	cant_complain !
0	top service :-)
0	just amazed that i could arrange a delivery at 00 . 00pm on a saturday_night and receive goods the next_day .
0	very cool .
0	really good service .
0	arranged a time for the morning , 0 : 00 to 00 :_00am .
0	matt turned_up at 0 :_00am !
0	he was very friendly and polite .
0	had one tyre changed , was pretty quick .
0	the price was a lot_cheaper_than the garages that i had tried .
0	i was very impressed and would recommend them to friends and family .

0	i cannot_complain_about a thing and would recommend henheaven to anyone .... infact i have already_recommended to a few friends currently planning hen doos !
0	all straight_forward , good price and fantastic , helpful and quick response customer service !
0	thank_you .
0	i decided to book with these after getting a number of quotes from others .
0	the quote i got from jay was personal unlike the others i received .
0	i called jay and he was very helpful in giving me ideas on how to plan the hen_weekend i was arranging .
0	i couldn_'_t_believe they only wanted £_00 deposit for the lot of us ( 00 ).
0	i went with his suggestion and couldn_'_t fault how the weekend flowed .
0	nottingham was great , the hotel was central and a short_walk to the naked male drawing class .
0	this was hilarious , liz loved her photo opportunity with the naked model !
0	we then got changed and had cocktail_making and party boards in vodka rev .
0	james made us all laugh and made liz the centre of attention .
0	after 0 cocktails and quite a few more drinks , i can '_t remember much else , but we all slept well and managed to have some breakfast in the morning .
0	i '_ll be booking again with funktion next year when my sis plans our best friends hen_do .

0	000_% satisfaction and will be back soon !
0	thanks oakland_furniture
0	i tried din_dins superfood for dogs after a friend recommended it .
0	i was already feeding my dog mimi a combination of raw food and nature '_s menu ( in an ideal world i '_d feed her the barf diet however she seems to agree better with a bit of rice in with her meat .
0	she doesn_'_t absorb as well if she doesn_'_t have the bulk mixed in and bones seem to go right through her !)
0	so , mimi is already pretty healthy .
0	but i did notice after a few_weeks of supplementing her diet with din_dins her sometimes slightly smelly breath had improved and her coat was even more glossy .
0	mimi sometimes has slightly thinning patches of hair behind her ears , these have also improved no end !
0	an excellent product , i would and do recommend to all dog_owners !
0	secure and easy site to pay bills or buy what you want on
0	love it for christmas and birthdays
0	facebook what can i say .... staying connected .... playing_games .... getting to see photos of close friends or family ... love it
0	love how you can ask it a question and it answers you
0	what can i say i have to pay my bills
0	love yahoo .... when my husband deploys this is how we stay connected and how our lil angel gets to see her daddy
0	great site to get anything you want
0	we have a saying in our house when something is dis agreed upon .... google it !!
0	!
0	you can find directions .... answers to random questions ... music .... videos .... health questions or answers .... its better_than having a book infront of you !!!
0	i love it
0	has anything you could wish for ... seriously amazing site ... if you get screwed over .... ebay will back up you on your payment and re fund you so it completely safe to buy !
0	all the free_samples to help you find the items right for you and the price of all the products ... love this site
0	easy to use design studio and a good range to choose from .

0	thank_you .
0	item arrived extremely fast and was very well_packaged .
0	thank_you ever so much :-).
0	great deal too :-)
0	no_problems with products .
0	however , somehow the company can go to the post_office to deliver goods to mainland_uk , but not to northern_ireland ?!?
0	please get out of the dark ages !
0	!
0	purchased some decorations for my engagement party and received the products the following_day , even_though we didnt select express delivery !
0	was very happy with my purchases and the speed of the service was brilliant !
0	it '_s really a good site
0	ordered big bertha bean_bag , delivery arrived 0 - 0_weeks as stated , with informed delivery and 0 hour time_slot helped .
0	bean_bag is wonderful , beans come seperate but its easy to pour beans into the bag , zip it up , very comfy , very pleased
0	ordered my bean_bag on 0nd nov , was told 0_weeks delivery , then go pushed to week 00 and now pushed to week 0 , now at the end of week 0 another nothing has arrived ...
0	tried_emailing , no replied , no phone number to actually talk to anyone !
0	waiting 0_months for a bean_bag is not acceptable and no communication or even a simple apology and explanation , no to mention no keeping customers up to date on their order
0	will never buy from infurn again and am telling the world not to buy either
0	so impressed with glasses_direct from the free home_trial to the super_fast delivery and excellent prices .
0	would recommend to anyone .
0	very fast service and easy to order .
0	used them a couple of times , first for me to buy a snugg case which came extremely quickly and was great quality .
0	dropped my ipad a couple of days ago and not a scratch !
0	really get the quality you pay for .
0	then used them again to buy the ipod_nano watch_strap for my brother and the kindle case for my mum and once again i was not dissapointed .
0	great service and products , the quality is top_grade !!
0	!
0	avoid using orange !
0	signed_up for a one month rolling_contract sim only - ( carphonewarehouse has confirmed this ) but orange still refuses to cancel contract stating i signed_up for 00 months which is incorrect .
0	despite 0 hours on the phone , they refuse to cancel .
0	bad_experience do not use orange !!
0	!
0	easy to navigate , would use again
0	first time customer , i ordered a toilet_pan and basin and fixings , however the basin was out of stock and wouldn_'_t be in until the 0th_august .
0	i am doing full bathroom renovation and going on holiday at the end of august so could not wait on the basin coming into stock as i had to arrange plumber etc and it wouldn_'_t leave me enough time to complete before holiday
0	promptly called customer service and cancelled full order due to out of stock item , lady very helpful and said will pass on to accounts to refund .
0	0 dys later , no confirmation of refund , customers services say its not instant and can '_t tell me when it will be done
0	they are very quick t take payment but i am now £_000 . 00 out of pocket and cannot get them to refund this anytime_soon .
0	very close to calling my bank and telling them the situation and its not authorised transaction and the police also as its now fraud for keeping my money ...
0	a very unhappy customer and will not be using ever again ....
0	i have booked the collection / delivery by parcel0go .
0	i called to ask when would be the collection time as i need to go out on the day just for an_hour .
0	i was hoping that the call_centre agent would be able to tell me what sort of time ( morning or afternoon ) so that i can pop out before / or after the collection .
0	unfortunately , the answer i got was the time_slot given was 0am to 0pm , which means that i have to wait in all day .
0	when i call to cancel , the agent said she was processing the cancellation , but when i checked on the website , it still depicted that the collection had been processed and myhermes agent would come and collect the parcel .
0	this means that nothing has_been done to cancel the order . the agent on the live_chat was quite rude , too .
0	very frustrating !
0	i ordered a nextbase 0 click n go from 0wisemonkeys recently .
0	ordering online was quick and simple and confirmation sent quickly .
0	i was also sent an_email on the day of delivery advising me of the time_slot it would be delivered in enabling_me to plan my day without having to wait in for the delivery .
0	the descriptions on the website of the various portable_dvd_players provided detailed_information that helped_us choose the best product for us .
0	excellent service , i would recommend 0wisemonkeys to others and use them again myself in future .
0	unacceptable service .
0	waiting on refund for a suit which cost £_000 .
0	emailed over three_times took a week for a response which basically states some rubbish about high email volumes and the email received showed no interest or_inclination to look into or deal with my query .
0	just basically states it takes 00 days to issue a refund and i should contact them after this time period if not received .
0	this does not give me any confidence in their service what so ever .
0	now made a complaint and waiting on some response from topman .
0	i do not understand how other stores refund within a matter of days and retain good communication with their customers other than topman is holding_onto my money to gain interest on it !
0	warning to all avoid topman !
0	!
0	thieves they take your money you need to pay 0 to 0 times more and call_center hhhhhhhh no words for their disgusting behavior . lesson never ever go for eon
0	all items arrived incredibly fast & well_packed ( they always do ; d ), and the 0 . 0l bottle of soy_sauce i ordered on this occasion was not in stock .
0	so i was sent 0x 0l bottles instead for which i was charged no extra .

0	i '_ve_used hostelbookers a few_times_now and recommended them to friends and have never had or heard of a bad_experience .
0	take for example my first booking , which i ended_up having to change ... twice !
0	hostelbookers ( and the hostels themselves ) made everything so easy and were so accommodating , i couldn_'_t ask for more .
0	thanks !
0	supplement_warehouse always has the best deals !
0	i used to order from other_companies online but since i started ordering from supplement_warehouse i never shop anywhere_else !
0	they have great prices and fast shipping !
0	when my friend told me about this site , i couldn_'_t_believe that it is possible to have such a high_quality item for 0 quid ..
0	i bought many items from this site , but just recently i received a skirt which was too small and called them up and got through a very polite gentleman_who gave_me the best help i '_ve ever received from a company .
0	keep_up the fantastic work !
0	ps more bags please !!
0	!
0	joined this site last_week and placed hundreds of bids and never won anything .
0	other_reviewers are correct its rubbish .
0	i often go to this site to check if a new tv_programme or a film is worth watching .
0	very reliable as the feedback is by other_users of the site so it is very geniune .
0	it has not let_me down yet :)
0	not very reliable at all
0	be warned some of the tickets that they say are available are not !
0	very deceptive .
0	i hate this site it took me ages to choose my buy my groceries .
0	the site is not well_laid_out , not very user_friendly .
0	some of the items that where delivered where damaged like the eggs and the yoguart .
0	they also have a restriction on mineral water_bottles , they are very mean .
0	superb site in my opinion .
0	great for news and weather as well as for iplayer .
0	i enjoy catching up on my favourite tv & radio 0 shows that i have missed .
0	excellent for listening to the radio 0 whilst you do the housework .
0	i saved 00_% buying from ebay on a digital_camera that i wanted for holiday .
0	it is good but you have to be careful here and not buy from anyone that has no or poor feedback .
0	i really like buying items on this site for my son .
0	the layout of the site is good it is so user_friendly and i love looking at the user feedbacks as they are the ultimate guide for me to buy an item .
0	best place to buy for kids .

0	i have ordered from here many_times and will_continue to do so .
0	i have been using the products for years and have had many great results .
0	the shipping timeframe is fast and its always a treat to find the product ( s ) waiting for me in the mail .

0	awesome !!!!
0	!
0	the prices are cheapest i ' v found and you can also add free_samples to your cart , so you '_ll be able to know how different stuff works and makes you feel , which is a great thing since some fat burners give you different feelings and its best to try them 0st ... great way to try before you buy !

0	i have been ordering supplements online for a long time , but just recently found supplementwarehouse . com .
0	i am impressed with their huge_selection of products , as well as their price match_guarantee !!!
0	this is a great site , and i will definitely return :)
0	i found this company online through a link posted on facebook and i am glad i did find it as the website and customer service is excellent , i could not possibly think of one fault for the customer service or the website .
0	the delivery is very fast - i ordered the incorrect size with one item , it was returned to freestylextreme on the monday , i received an_email on the tuesday saying the return was received and a further email on wednesday to say the bigger_size had been posted - brilliant !
0	love that i can find a large range of clothing and brands that i could not find in the uk before finding this website and the prices are good also which is a bonus .
0	i have recommended to friends and family and will certainly be placing an order again in the near_future .
0	thanks to all at freestylextreme !

0	ordered a christmas_tree on friday 0nd november , i had carefully read the terms on the website before placing my order and it clearly said that the tree would be sent the next working day or if there was any delays that i would be notified by phone or email .
0	i waited_until the following_tuesday ( 0th_nov ) to call the company , they told me that the tree was out of stock and that it would be back in stock and would be out to me within the week .
0	to cut a really long_story_short , i called them again another two times to be told there had been further delays and that the product would be sent out to me soon .
0	by the 00rd_november i was sick of waiting and being ' fobbed_off ' with excuses and i cancelled the order after three_weeks of waiting .
0	i asked for an_email to be sent to me confirming that the order had been cancelled and to date nothing has ever came through .
0	it would have been nice if the company had actually contacted me and made me aware of the delay at_least once throughout the three_weeks , instead of me having to call them numerous_times .
0	i have never received such a bad service from an on - line company and will certainly be avoiding them in the future !
0	i booked a spa overnight_stay at carden park for may_0000 .
0	paid £_000 for 0 of us to go , only to receive a call from shirley at lastminute stating that the deal did not exist and that i needed to change the date for spa package .
0	no mention of a refund initially .
0	i called following_day and asked for a refund .
0	00 days_later , still no refund .
0	i had even called lastminute . com 0 mins before the online booking and confirmed that there were 0 rooms available at the venue .
0	yet , in those 0 mins , all 0 rooms had sold out ( 00 :_00am !!!)
0	i spoke to hayley , sharday and another rude_woman .
0	all said i needed to wait 00 days for it to be processed .
0	then i discover that they had not bothered to put refund through as they couldn_'_t refund back onto america express .
0	no phone_call in 00 days to say this .
0	i then get told by hayley it would be paid in my bank as soon as finance guy ( kumar ) comes in to the office , at 0 . 00pm , still no refund .
0	i call and they tell me that it is processed and will take 00_hours , even_though i have waited long enough already .
0	i get a call from hayley five mins later , she took down my card_details incorrectly and refund never been done even thoughh girl 0 mins earlier said it had already gone though , eventually after 00 days , i get my refund of £_000 back after 0 phone_calls , shocking customer service from girls who couldn_'_t care less about helping_me , one kept putting me on hold so she didn_'_t have to listen to me !!
0	!
0	basically the spa deal never existed , carden park declined it because they had no rooms , so why take my money when deal doesn_'_t exist .
0	dodgy company , would never use again .
0	everything about this experience points to bad practice and working under - hand and certainly false deals / advertisements .
0	huge discount and quick delivery .
0	fantastic service , the company phoned me yesterday to say they would b dispatching my tickets that afternoon and i received them this morning , will_defo b using this company again , :) ill b back in touch for titp and pink tickets , thankyou guys xxxxx

0	good service and delivery from chemist_direct on time .

0	i also liked the range of products out here and the prices too are reasonable , at_least lower_than what i buy at my chemist store .
0	recommended to shop_here .
0	i was over the moon that i managed to find some amazing bargains from fragrance_direct .
0	their great prices meant that i could get all of the things that i needed without spending an arm and a leg .
0	it '_s such a fantastic place to find some real gems and from now on , will somewhere that i regularly shop .
0	well_worth being facebook friends for flash offers .
0	delivery of items is fast and efficient .
0	one of my favourite online shopping_experiences .
0	i had used viagogo last_year to buy lady_gaga tickets .
0	0_days before the event i received an e_- mail advising the seller couldn_'_t provide the tickets .
0	the day before replacement tickets were sourced .
0	stressful but okay .
0	have now booked p ! nk tickets for manchester 00 / 00 / 00 and with 0_days to go it has happened again but this time they have not responded about replacement tickets .
0	i have sent 0 further messages with no contact and am so worried that the hotel rooms and 0x train_tickets are going to be a waste of money , on top of the extortionate price of the tickets already purchased .
0	will never use again and would suggest others stay well clear !

0	after much research_into different companies that buy laptops , i ended_up choosing syl because they provided the best quote for my 0 year_old macbook .
0	in fact , i was pleasantly_surprised by how much they were willing to offer - almost seemed to good to be true !
0	their response time was quick and professional and even when my quote had expired due to unforeseen_circumstances , they were willing to honour it with no_hassles .
0	i was paid promptly into my account too .
0	from_start to finish , i found the whole_process simple and straightforward and i really appreciated that they were so efficient with their communication .
0	i would definitely recommend using syl and i would happily use their services again .

0	i would highly suggest using this web_site for all of your nutritional_needs !
0	the website has always delivered .
0	it has always helped_me find the right hostel for my various trips .
0	i wanted a toy box for all of my little_ones christmas_presents .
0	this one was the best value i could find .

0	it arrived in this time_slot .
0	toy box was easy to assemble , looks lovely and holds more than you '_d think !
0	i emailed mytuxedo to enquire_about one of their products and recieved a reply the next_day which was very useful .

0	products were of high_quality and perfect !
0	i stumbled_across this site while looking for some salon style hair products .

0	the website looks professional , prices and delivery is competitive too .
0	would definitely use again for my hair products .
0	spent fifty pound on a voucher , could not contact vendor to redeem .
0	living_social refused to refund or credit account .
0	definitely do not use this company , i certainly will not use again .
0	terrible delivery service , please do not order from this company , i ordered 0 items of furniture from them and as i live in " the country " ( large town just outside glasgow ) they would only deliver to the pavement outside my property .
0	the girl on the phone made it sound like i was ridiculous expecting the delivery company to deliver to my flat , i think its ridiculous that they expect me to pay £_00 delivery to have the items dumped on the pavement outside my flat !
0	they are also threatening to charge delivery even_though they did not deliver .
0	nice professional website but do not be_fooled by the prices .
0	use another company , be warned .
0	i have now waited almost 0_weeks on an_email_advising when i will receive my refund .
0	i '_ve taken legal_advice and am patiently awaiting their response to my requests both on email and telephoned .

0	can not recommend this company enough
0	ordered my map after using a groupon_voucher and it arrived well_packaged and quickly .
0	it was " flat packed " and simple to put_together and once made it was very sturdy .
0	i have received several compliments on the map with people asking where i purchased it .
0	i really want the dinosaur one next
0	we love our new basin - its stillk in the box while we decorate the rest but it already looks pretty .
0	arrived on time and well_packaged .
0	and was much_cheaper_than elsewhere
0	i paid for express delivery on an order from amazon , and the seller has chosen to send the parcel with yodel .
0	tracking shows it has_been at my local_depot , 0 mile from the delivery address , since 0th_feb .
0	it then shows ' delivery not attempted ' for several days ( i . e .
0	couldnt be bothered ), followed_by a ' weather delay ' ( weather here is fine ), then 0 x ' delivery attempted , could not gain_access '.
0	delivery is to my work place , their first ' no access ' was due to attempting to deliver at 0pm ( not in business hours despite company name being clearly_indicated ), the second was 0 . 00pm and i know they didn_'_t try as i was covering the reception_desk at the front of the building all afternoon and no vehicles came into our car_park !
0	!
0	their ' live_chat ' has_been particularly unhelpful too , just saying ' sorry we '_ll get it there when we can '.
0	no definite answers , no sincere_apology and no compensation / gesture of goodwill offered .
0	shocking customer service .
0	it is now 00th_feb , and still no sign of my ' express delivery '.
0	i found the bed i wanted online , on sale , however i decided to go to my local_branch to order as i was hoping to see one on display ( which it wasn_'_t unfortunately ).
0	i waited around for quite a while for a sales_assistant to take my order , i felt like they ignored me as being a girl in my early 00s , they probably didn_'_t expect me to buy anything or spend much .
0	when i finally got assistance to order , i had to explain the item '_s specification to the assistant ( for example , she asked what colour i wanted , it only comes in one colour ).
0	she quoted me a 0 - 0 week delivery time , despite their website stating within 0_weeks , but i agreed as i explained i had the 0th week off work already so that would be ideal .
0	i was assured i would be contacted to discuss the delivery , which i paid £_00 for due to my order being in their higher value bracket .
0	at the end of week 0 , i emailed fv to ask where my order was as it was late and i '_d had no contact from them at all .
0	the manager rang me back promptly within the hour , and apologised saying he would contact the warehouse and find out , then call me the next_day .
0	he didn_'_t .
0	i left it 0_days then called to be told he was not working .
0	the assistant told me she could get my delivery to me 0_days_later on thursday ( the end of week 0 ).
0	i explained that this was not convenient , as i had discussed with the manager before .
0	i was told to sort it myself with the delivery company when they called me , a call i am expecting this week .
0	i am now expected to take unpaid time off work to accept their 0 - week late delivery , and i will also have to unassemble and move my old bed myself ( as i said , i am a girl in my 00s and i '_m not great at diy or lifting ).
0	to top it all off , i had a call from my parents which is my previous address ( which they took for credit check purposes ) to say fv have left 0 incomplete voicemails on their phone - i don_'_t live there , i only have a mobile and i don_'_t know how they got the number or why they feel the need to ring it !
0	!
0	wish i had read these awful reviews on here before stepping into fv instead of just being sucked in by a great bed offer .
0	fingers_crossed it gets delivered at some point , with all the parts , undamaged and assembled correctly .
0	may be too much to ask .
0	booked a one night stay in a city hotel in the uk for 0 people .
0	very reasonable and hotel was lovely , posh considering it worked out cheaper_than the neighbouring travelodge .
0	it was easy to book online , i paid a deposit amount to suit me , got confirmation emails , accommodation vouchers and the rest of the payment was taken on the date agreed , no_fuss .
0	on arrival at the hotel ( around 0_months after booking , and around 0pm ), the receptionist informed us that alpharooms had not forwarded our requests on for neighbouring rooms , and had not told them that we had booked for 0 people in one room ( one triple and two doubles ).
0	apparently they did not offer triple rooms - despite the alpharooms website offering this and allowing me to book this .
0	as such we had to wait 00_minutes whilst they found suitable rooms for us , and we ended_up being 0 floors apart_from each other .
0	if alpharooms had communicated better with the hotel , we could have at_least been on the same floor , and our rooms would have been ready .
0	they had 0_months to tell the hotel about the rooms we had booked and our request to be close to each other , it '_s not as if it was last_minute .
0	i won_'_t be booking with alpharooms again unless i just need one room for 0 - 0 people .
0	very speedy service , i posted the phone on the tuesday and the money was in my account by the wednesday with follow_up e_-_mails straight_away .
0	excellent service , will use again !
0	i '_ve ordered multiple_times from ziip , always received codes within an_hour and working perfectly .
0	however i feel a true judge of a company is how the deal with things when it does go_wrong .
0	i received a code that according to origin had already been used .
0	i received a reply to my first email within 00_minutes informing_me of the situation ( as the error was the fault of ea and not ziip ).
0	i have now received a working code along with a transcript of the contact with ea and a heartfelt apology .
0	it '_s so nice to speak to someone that actually_cares_about their customers , and i will most definitely continue to use ziip and recommend them to anyone i know who games !
0	we had some special_requests off the typical deliverables and those high up at atom00 went the extra_mile to help our junior team .
0	much_appreciated and fully recommended !
0	i waited nearly an_hour , listening to the most annoying music , especially when the loop played the songs for a second and third time .
0	when i finally spoke to someone the department i needed had had gone home !
0	they said they would phone back .
0	they didn_'_t .
0	i waited , listening to the same looped music for 00_minutes to be told nothing had been logged from my previous call .
0	they assured me someone would call back in three_days .
0	that was six days ago !
0	i '_m going to have to call them back , that '_s three hours of my life i '_ll never get back !
0	i received my acrylic and overlay course in quick time .
0	happy with everything that came in the box . i finished my course and sent it back .
0	i passed my course with a credit .
0	really happy to me starting my matance course after christmas :)
0	fast shipping , great prices , tons of free_samples ... what could be better .
0	great website with a great range of not only american sweets but other_countries too which was a nice_surprise !
0	arrived quickly and well_packaged - in a decent_sized box so nothing was squashed .
0	will use again !
0	always something different to try .
0	this website made planning and booking my trip to scotland ( from alaska ) hassle_free .
0	i am confident of where i am staying , that i will be safe , clean and that i paid a fair price .
0	i will certainly use this site again .
0	great customer service and the best signal in the uk
0	absolutely_fabulous !
0	friday , 0 september_0000 - lauren rating :
0	i ordered 0 fascinators they were for my best friends wedding , for the bridesmaids .... they arrived in super_fast shipping time and easy transaction !
0	the fascinators were a hit and looked awesome with our hair !
0	will definitely be a returning_customer !
0	i '_ve shopped alot at argos for many_years , my mother used to say that i kept them in business .
0	however , this has always been in the actual store .
0	my sister has made her first order with their home delivery service , which is still ongoing as they keep delaying her delivery .
0	she ordered two items with them , both listed as in stock .
0	a week_later ( and three_days before the scheduled delivery ), they called and said they were having problems with the suppliers ( i . e .
0	one , or both , of the items were not actually in stock ).
0	she , unhappily , rescheduled the delivery for ten days_later .
0	this time , they call on the morning of the delivery and say that the item ( s ) are still unavailable , and that it is a short_notice cancellation because it only just showed up on the systems .
0	to say the least , seems like argos need to update their systems and reconsider their suppliers .
0	this may seem like a minor_inconvenience to some , but my sister has just moved_into a new home and needs these items .
0	one is a fridge_freezer , and due to argos ' utter incompetence , she is losing a significant_amount of money every day because she is having to waste food as she has nowhere to store it .
0	so that '_s how argos is effecting her financially .
0	the other is a set of bunk_beds for her two children , who have to remain sleeping on the floor until argos decide that they can finally fulfil their end of the deal .
0	regardless of her personal situation , fact is fact .
0	claiming that you have an item in stock and available for purchase is selling under misinformation .
0	furthermore , agreeing to dates and being unable to meet these agreements abuses the contract to which the consumer agreed in purchasing these good .
0	they have offered to refund the £ 0 . 00 delivery cost , which doesn_'_t come close to the amount that she has had to pay because of their incompetence , never mind the inconveniences and sufferings of her and her two children .
0	she was actually warned by friends beforehand not to use this service as they had experience problems , but thought that based on our in - store experience , argos was a trustworthy company .
0	i have since heard from other friends that they have had similar grievances .
0	this service is appalling and will cause you inconvenience , take up your time , and , depending_on the particular situation , might actually cost you financially .
0	don_'_t risk it .
0	i wanted to give this company no stars , but it turns_out i can '_t submit this without giving it one .
0	i have ordered several things from bondara , never with any trouble .
0	items always as_described , fast delivery and great prices .
0	will_continue to shop_here and continue to recommend to people .
0	everytime i order something i love it and it always looks good .
0	total bargain .
0	but there is one downfall , the bulk buyers who then sell on ebay at triple the price .
0	you really need to limit things per customer .
0	i have been a customer with o0 since march of this year .
0	i took our a 00 month_contract with a blackberry_bold 0000 0_weeks_ago the phone stopped_working i took it back to my nearest_store sent it off for repairs and a week_later was contacted to say that the phone couldn_'_t be fixed and because it was under_warranty ( great i thought ) i was legible for a brand_new phone , i took away what i thought was a ' brand_new ' phone of the same model i had previous , to find out that it is infact a re - cycled phone where somebody at some point in time has had the phone previously to me so deffinately not ' brand_new '!
0	now 0_weeks on my ' new phone ' has had to be sent off again for the exact_same problem only this time when i went into the store the sales_advisor told me it was a ' common fault ' on the specific model i had , clearly upset i asked was there anything i could do even suggested paying more to my existing contract to change the model phone ( which i shouldnt have to seeing as the model they sold me on a 00 month contact hasnt even lasted 00 and was malfunctioning as of its own accord and not my fault ) to which i was told to basically ring o0 customer_services and ' kick off '.
0	after_spending 00_minutes on the phone to multiple advisors and being hung_up on twice !!
0	i was basically told to like it or lump it there was nothing that they were willing to do to help me .
0	i do not agree all the staff i spoke to that day were rude and didn_'_t care 0 women genuinely tried to help the situation but still after our conversation it was left unsolved .
0	i have emailed o0 a complaint and it will be reviewed within 00 days but i don_'_t expect their reply will resolve the situation i '_m in .
0	i do not value their customer_relations much after this experience .
0	once more my parcel was delivered to the wrong_address if a delivery man dont_know difference_between flats and house it is hard to expect good service .
0	once more i had to appologise to my neighbours who has got same door number as me as i felt quilty knocking to their doors and begging for a parcel .
0	i will avoid post_office at any cost and i will pay extra for a different company
0	ordered a junior tennis_racquet for my son .
0	website was simple to use , i understood which tennis_racquet best suited his age and the delivery was super quick .
0	many_thanks .
0	great value , fast and free delivery .
0	excellent .
0	great price , great product , speedy service .
0	please_avoid this company at all costs !
0	i did all my christmas shopping online this year and this remains the only item i have not yet received !
0	it was also the first order that i placed - on 0 december and only after chasing my order did i receive an_email_saying that it was ' despatched ' on 00 december !
0	still nothing !
0	i have researched this company and can only add to the hundreds of claims that they are thieving fraudsters !
0	i have contacted my bank and am looking to get my credit_card recharged - i will also be contacting the police and do my utmost to get this company rubbed through all_kinds of dirt .
0	i have used mazuma twice_now and have always found them to be quick , efficient and easy to use .
0	the site is well set out and finding your handset model with accompanying price they will pay is easy .
0	they send full instructions on how to remove all your personal_data from the individual handset before sending it back to them .
0	the freepost_envelope arrives quickly as does the cheque once you '_ve sent them your phone .. there is even a choice of ways to be paid .
0	really great company , would definitely use again and recommend !
0	!
0	love shopping online ?
0	then you will absolutely love topcashback !
0	it is so easy , quick paying and i '_ve earnt hundreds of pounds for a few seconds and couple of extra clicks !
0	join today :)
0	does exactly as promised .
0	excellent service , would happily_recommend .
0	fridge_freezer is perfect
0	deliver guy was prompt and helpful
0	i have ordered beef dishes last_week from that takeaway , timely delivery with good food .
0	worthable for money .
0	sw has the best deals on protein foods and other supplements i '_ve found anywhere .
0	i don_'_t even bother shopping elsewhere anymore , although sometimes i compare sw '_s prices to others ' just to make me feel extra good about how much money i '_m saving !
0	my orders always arrive on my doorstep in a shockingly speedy turnaround time ; they must literally ship out the items the very second i hit the confirm purchase button online !
0	the one time i spoke with customer service , my concerns were immediately addressed and instantly resolved , no problem .
0	sw has definitely earned a loyal_customer in me !
0	no printable e_- tickets for the gig i am going to and my name put on a list of attendees .
0	was told to print my receipt and show my bank card as proof .
0	its a really dodgy practice and unnerved me from wanting to buy tickets although when buying tickets it said e_- tickets would be available
0	ordered products and got free delivery , all delivered well within their quoted time !
0	there is above beyond what you ' re looking for with such a fantastic range of products !
0	love this company and will use them every time in the future .
0	returned an item to very and received the refund immediately .
0	impressive in my standards .
0	although i won_'_t be ordering from very again because they are contracted with yodel of whom are a terrible delivery company .
0	accidently let it run over an extra month .
0	would not let_me have a refund for this mistake .
0	some lovely daylight_robbery
0	i was keeping an eye on the tracking of delivery .
0	this parcel was very important ( an_alternative wedding dress from very ).
0	i sat all morning staring_at my front_door with my dog sat at the window ready to shout to tell me the man was at the door .
0	my dog didn_'_t bark and there wasn_'_t a knock .
0	i checked the tracking at 00 . 00 supposedly they had tried to deliver and left a card .
0	there was no card , no bark , no knock , and all this happened while i sat 00ft from the front_door .
0	so i rang the depot and she rang the driver , who told her that he had run_out of cards but did knock .
0	my dog was confused is this man invisible ?
0	she then went on to say she checked the drivers tracker ( in his body ?
0	i live in a lane he can '_t drive down .)
0	and told me the driver had been to my village implying i '_m the one who is lying .
0	my dog licked the frustrated tears from my face ( having real wedding dress problems ) and patted my knee .
0	she told me the driver will be back by two .
0	i '_m sat in the window myself now and waiting for the apperence of this driver .
0	i will be ringing her back at two to ask her to check his tracker .
0	if this is the type of service i can expect i will not be using them again which means i will avoid very . co . uk .
0	feckers
0	later that day .
0	the driver turned_up at 0 . 00 and knocked this time , my dog barked and went mental to get a stroke from the visitor .
0	alas i put him in the kitchen .
0	i open the door to collect my parcel from the jobs worth and he stands and lies to my face .
0	" oh i knocked but there wasn_'_t an answer and i didn_'_t have any cards left ".
0	i smiled sarcastically while my dog flipped him off .
0	the barking is answer enough for me .
0	there needs to be a negative star system put in place .
0	or better yet get watchdog involved or whoever it is that handles bad practice !
0	i am very thankful for the detailed_instructions and quick service .
0	i would like to fully recommend the provider for its professionalism !
0	good communication , wonderful customer service , quick delivery .
0	my husband was very happy with his glasses .
0	will definitely use them again !
0	interlink_express told me i would receive my package between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 i waited at home the whole day and nothing arrived .
0	i sent two emails but received no reply .
0	they claimed i was out and there was no one to sign for the package , however it said on the website my package hadn_'_t even of left the depot station .
0	the next_day i receive a text saying my package will be here between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 , i look online at 00 : 00 and it says my driver is an_hour away and the package still_hasn_'_t arrived .
0	this company is a joke , i don_'_t expect to waiting at home all day in case they send it back to the depot station , also the customer service is non_existent .
0	edit
0	i am still_waiting for my package which was meant to arrive 0 hours ago , the gps tracker for the van said it was 00_minutes away around an_hour ago , now when i go to track the van the map has disappeared .
0	i also can '_t ring anyone to see where my package is .
0	this is a complete_joke and i will never use this service again / discourage anyone i know from using your awful company .
0	quickly delivered would order again , products were as stated .
0	yeh .
0	i am in a state of utter stress because of my move at the moment !
0	i had an_urgent query , that seemed a hopeless case to me , but i thought i '_d try the live_chat help anyway .
0	and bang , a lovely person called gemma was there , immediately cheering me up by being really friendly and putting smileys etc !!
0	and what i thought was a hopeless request , was transformed into something that might actually work out now by her as well !!
0	top_marks for gemma !!
0	efficient , quick , helpful , friendly , positive !!
0	really refreshing to have a person that '_s working in customer_services who seems to actually enjoy her job for once !!
0	:))
0	thanks gemma , and i am praying for everything to work out at my pickup tomorrow !
0	let '_s hope , your great help helped !!
0	;))
0	i found this great gift for my friends 00st_birthday ( silver dominoes set in engraved case ) this was great as most websites only sell engraved beer glasses , tankards , hip_flasks etc and as my friend does not drink these weren_'_t really suitable .
0	i missed my delivery and we emailed in and got a reply within 00_minutes advising they would get in touch with the courier .
0	we managed to pick_up our order the same day .
0	i couldn_'_t wait to open it !
0	the gift is perfect and the quality of the engraving was better_than_expected .
0	i will definitely use this website again .
0	the only_downside was that the box it came in is very dented which is a shame as it would have been nice to wrap the present in the box but it is not a big problem and i know things probably get knocked around a bit in the delivery process .
0	very user_friendly , easy to compare accommodation and find the one that is right for you .
0	pictures , ratings , maps , directions and reviews help customers to review information and make an informed selection .
0	fantastic price and fast delivery , thanks !
0	i could not have asked for a more beautiful present !
0	it is better_than what i expected it to be .
0	a huge thank_you !
0	!
0	i ordered the very last item and instantly got email_updates to confirm it had been ordered , dispatched etc .
0	it arrived_safely and i would not_hesitate to use facewest again .
0	my only problem is i wish i could have bought more but thats my fault for spotting the bargain so late !
0	!
0	i was very nervous ordeing dresses online but i am glad i took the leap .
0	i researched the company with the us better business bureau and ordered .
0	i got shoes , a veil and the dress i wanted for less_than the price that boutiques in my area were charging .
0	i also ordered two bridesmaid gowns .
0	everything arrived as ordered and it came early .
0	great store
0	no_issues with my booking .
0	would definitely use the site again .
0	information and details of the hostel were exactly like the description online .
0	have sold over 0 , 000 items on ebay with the majority being sent by royal_mail .
0	i have now received all the items i have ordered and all bar two of my sold items have arrived with the buyer in a timely_manner .
0	royal_mail are the best unless you are willing to pay for a courier .
0	when you transfer_funds from a bank_account to paypal it says it takes 0 - 0_days but always takes seven and sometimes longer .
0	its pure greed that it takes this long because they suck up as much interest with your money as they can .
0	will avoid paypal an even co '_s associated with them from now on .
0	always helpful and friendly .
0	normally 00hrs delivery .
0	they also have a great replacement and service guarantee ... what more could you ask ?
0	if gak dont stock it , i dont_bother !
0	moved to talktalk because of very high charges only to find talktalk are just as expensive but the service they provide is appalling .
0	internet is sooo slow , it just stops working many_times during the day and at night cant even watch a 0 min video without constant buffering .
0	also talktalk put a cap on charges and once you go over the limit they simply cut you off ... every time !
0	just waiting for the contract to end so i can get_rid .
0	i '_ve bought winter_tyres from their website .
0	i '_ve paid more than 000pounds for them , and waited for delivery .
0	day later ive received a phone_call with information that tyres i '_ve choice are out of stock ( why there was no information on website just asked me ro pay for them ???)
0	they informed me that they could suply me with different one but almost same specification and price .
0	ive said ok , as i was desperate for them .
0	but when tyres arrived , ive check them on internet and found the same almost 00 pound cheaper per tyre .
0	feeling cheated .
0	will not complain as leaving uk on saturady and need those tyres .
0	buying tyres via telephone is pointless as you cant actually check them straight_away to know what they are offering to you .
0	but if there is no tires available in stock , they should inform about that on website , not jusk ask you to pay for what they haven_'_t actually got .
0	after entering a relationship with a born and bred birmingham local , i knew that we would never go to a high_street shop because of the quality of the ' jewelry quarter ' that had been used by so many generations before us .
0	their website is very user_friendly with good quality images and interactivity to see a 000 degree view of their rings .
0	they also offer information on different aspects of jewelry such as ' carats ' and all other terms , a very useful aspect for non - researched people like us !
0	obviously we looked at other shops , and thought about visiting them on the day when we went to look for rings .
0	however , as soon as we were welcomed into the shop and greeted with nothing but the best service that i have ever received , we knew that we were never going to go_anywhere_else .
0	we were served by sara that day , who was the most understanding person i have ever met .
0	being a young couple , ( 00 and 00 at the time !)
0	sara was incredibly helpful and did not judge us on our circumstances , something of which had happened in a high_street store .
0	she was not pushy at all when i was looking at the rings , explaining everything in an easy to understand manner , and being very honest in what she thought was the most suited to my hands etc , regardless of the price .
0	after a short while once i had chosen my particular engagement_ring , she offered us a very good price and wished us all the best with everything , creating a very personal experience , and ending on a high note .
0	something of which i will never forget .
0	a few_months down the line , we have decided to purchase a wedding_band for myself ready for the big day when we eventually get round to it !
0	my fiancee has made many phone_calls to the shop , being presented again , with second to none customer service .
0	when we entered the shop we were again greeted like old friends in a professional_manner , even_though there were other potential_customers at the counters .
0	this time round we were served by margaret , whom , like sara , was so welcoming and friendly , and was incredibly helpful during the whole_process of choosing a wedding_band , and showed an incredible amount of knowledge on the subject .
0	i told her the sort of things i was thinking_about having and she immediately sought out a selection which were perfect !
0	( during this time , sara , from when we bought my engagement_ring , came and greeted us , making us feel very welcome to be back .)
0	a few_weeks after that , my fiancee wanted to get his granddad '_s ring_resized ( a very delicate subject ) which was dealt_with very easily in store .
0	we again saw margaret , and she was very helpful during the process , offering him different_ways in which the ring could be re - shaped ( it was going down from a t to an l , 0 sizes in total !)
0	she again , was not pushy in the process , and was very understanding and helpful during this time .
0	the whole_process was completed in store , by a gentleman_who had 00 years experience in marlows alone !
0	so we were in very good hands .
0	overall , marlows have been incredible with everything that we have needed from them , offering us the best prices , and the best quality for money .
0	their customer service is incredible , something of which makes every visit a pleasure , and every time we went back they always remembered us and created a completely_different experience to what you would expect anywhere_else .
0	thank_you marlows , for being the best around , and being a pleasure to purchase from !
0	all our best ,
0	emma and rob x
0	bing , bang , pow and my booking was done .
0	cheap rooms , ideals locations and easy to use website .
0	i would totally use hostel_bookers again .
0	i bought quite a lot of wowchers already and i have to say i really love the page .
0	great deals and very easy to order and to browse_through the website .
0	once i contacted the wowcher customer service because i didn_'_t get a reply from on of their companies and the lady helped_me straight_away , although it took quite a long time on the phone .
0	i always recommend wowcher to my friends because the deals are amazing and i '_ve never been disappointed so far .
0	:)
0	thanks wowcher !
0	the service is great , i ordered on the monday and my item had been delivered by the wednesday with free_postage . the website is very easy to use and is really clear , would recomend incrystal to all my friends and family and will be definatly be using incrystal in the future .
0	this site is excellent !
0	my iphone was unlock in just a few hours !
0	very trustworthy , reliable , and so worth it !
0	thank_you , thank_you !
0	:) i definitely recommend !!!!
0	!
0	i can_honestly_say that the team at top click_media have been a complete pleasure to work with .
0	from the initial project scoping to the delivery of our new site , everything has_been delivered seamlessly .
0	i will without_doubt work with them again , and wholeheartedly_recommend them to all of contacts .
0	spoke woth natalie on livechat as i booked a parcel , then realised i had to go out .
0	natalie was wonderful and told me i could rebook or if i felt it was safe enough along with other t & c '_s , i could leave it in my porch for the dfriver to collect .
0	thank_you natalie :-)
0	i used a search_engine and fragrance_direct came up with the best deal on what i wanted to buy .
0	great value and no_hassle .
0	i received emails to keep track of my order and it arrived super_fast .
0	will definitely use site again and highly_recommend !
0	i '_ve been a sky customer for over 0 years .
0	in that time i have moved_house and had a few minor technical_issues .
0	every_single time i have called sky i have been helped by a very friendly and competent advisor and i honestly could not fault them .
0	i constantly recommend them to friends .
0	recently i have been trying to reduce my bills in general and was offered a phone / tv / broadband package with another well - known company .
0	i called this other company to simply confirm my ' go live ' date .
0	after just under an_hour on the phone ( a combination of being put on hold and transferred to no less_than 0 different ' advisors ') they hung_up on me .
0	i called again and the same thing happened .
0	enraged at this point i then called sky ...
0	what a difference !
0	i did have to hold for a short while before being greeted_by a wonderfully helpful advisor .
0	i explained my situation with money struggles and she looked into my account and managed to upgrade my package and reduce my bill .
0	i was over the moon - not just about the price reduction but that she had taken the time to listen and made me feel like a valued_customer instead of a faceless account number .
0	i work in a call_centre myself and know how hard the job can be and how much abuse advisors are given .
0	i am really impressed with the service i have received at sky .
0	i can see from other reviews that not everyone agrees but i wanted to give my opinion because i know how often people manage to find time to complain , but it is much rarer for people to show appreciation for a job well_done .
0	so thank_you sky .
0	thank_you for having such wonderful call_centre operators .
0	yes the prices are not the most competitive but do you know what ?
0	i would much rather pay a bit extra and receive the excellent service i have come to expect over so long .
0	great prices and excellent service will definitely be using this site again !
0	!
0	from the form i had to fill in , to the arrival of the payment , the service was faultless .
0	very quick and easy and extremely prompt responses to any_queries .
0	i used to buy meat from my supermarket !
0	no more !!!!
0	never realised just how tasteless the meat is i have always bought !
0	gorgeous cumberland_sausages ... amazing steaks , beautiful steak_burgers , westin_gourmet all the way for me now !
0	delivered perfectly packaged , exactly when said i would !
0	cannot_fault a thing about my order ...
0	nothing !
0	i only used to have meat every so often , favouring vegetarian dishes over meat ( i '_m not vegetarian !)
0	but i am now a fully fledged carnivore again !
0	:-) even my children commented on how much_nicer their chicken was and they didn_'_t even know i had bought different !
0	that says it all for me !
0	westin_gourmet are proud of their meat ..... and so they darn well should be !!!!!
0	;-)
0	it '_s really easy to understand how to make a reservation and there '_s no extra fee .
0	the way of looking at the reviews it '_s really nice .
0	i ordered last_minute robbie_williams tickets yesterday ( tuesday ) @ 00pm they arrived this morning to be signed for at 0 . 00am !!
0	! faultless service easy to use website and payment system and superfast delivery .
0	i received a birthday treat of free delivery so used it to purchase the sexond set of dixit cards .
0	so easy to do and arrived in time for my hubby '_s birthday .
0	we have had lots of fun_playing the game with the new cards and can '_t wait to get the next set !
0	great service as always !
0	whenever i am having problem my apartment blocks , they always help , are always on time and are cheapest and best .
0	call them .
0	i have tried all other_companies , but must use for this one famous distinguish service .
0	highly_recommend this site if looking for airport_parking best site by far .
0	supplement_warehouse has excellent prices on products .
0	they are very quick to ship your order out which is something i value as a costumer .
0	if you are close enough to their warehouse to visit , the staff is always very helpful and friendly .
0	i also love the price match option .
0	that guarantees you are always getting the best price .
0	keep_up the good work !
0	would defo recommend jojo '_s , really fast delivery and the 0 items i ordered were of great quality .
0	fast ordering process , free delivery with a next_day delivery & even an_hour time_slot !
0	will definitely use as my main dog_food supplier from now on .
0	this is the second time i have traded items into ziffit and the experience is fantastic in comparison to some of the big market_leaders .
0	within a couple of days ziffit had accepted my order and had started the process of sending payment .
0	fantastic really happy , i will be back a third time !
0	!
0	second purchase from animed .
0	really great service .
0	i will definitely make a third purchase !
0	i bought a brand_new fridge_freezer in december , the fridge_freezer had an odd smell when it arrived but this was just put down to be being new .
0	after a couple of months the smell was getting worse and the fridge started making very loud noises , so phoned through to currys .
0	the first engineer was sent out , acknowledged the smell , but could not find where it was coming from .
0	since this point hotpoint have sent out a further 0 engineers , all whom found similar things .
0	at this point the office of fair_trading got involved , and a letter was sent recorded delivery to currys , this was signed for at the address but not response was ever received .
0	an_independent engineer found that the fridge is faulty and needs completely replacing .
0	currys have now received the fridge but feel it appropriate that after 0_months + of issues , that it will take at_least a further week to upload the report which was sent from one of there stores .
0	so after around 0_months , numerous phone_calls ( all made from us to them ) i am still left with a fridge_freezer that doesn_'_t work !
0	:(
0	i would never shop at , or recommend currys to friends or family or even my worst_enemy it has_been absolutely terrible !
0	slight_problem with product , was expecting to spend_ages trying to get it sorted and probably end up with no result .
0	printerbasics were very quick to respond to my email , very helpful , and fully honoured their no - quibble guarantee .
0	best customer service i '_ve encountered in ages .
0	i felt_compelled to write this review after_reading so many negative ones .
0	i ordered a pair of ugg austrailia classic boots 0_days ago using a 00_%_off promtional code that i found on a money saving website .
0	i got the uggs for £_000 which is a massive_saving compared to the rrp of £_000 .
0	i selected to have free standard delivery by yodel which is estimated to take up to 0 working_days from when the order is shipped .
0	after i ordered my uggs i had a look through some of the reviews some of which were really bad , i thought ' what have i done ' and spent the next few_days meticulously checking the yodel tracker service to see where my order was up to .
0	i received my ugg_boots 0_days after ordering them , they are fab and i cannot_fault the service i have received from rubbersole . co . uk or yodel , and i know i couldn_'_t have got the same genuine product for less anywhere_else .
0	i have used hqhair for several_years_now - i would never think of using any other site for my beauty needs .
0	it stocks a wide_range of quality brands and always provides a super quick and efficient service .
0	i would whole_heartedly recommend !
0	i '_ve_used zavvi quite a lot and im never disappointed , everything has_been delivered quickly and on time .
0	the one time i had a problem they sorted it fast and efficiently .
0	i would and do recommend ordering from zavvi .
0	i found the prices were really fair didnt think i would get anything for my phones , and the pack and cheque were sent really fast .
0	i couldnt_fault them on there service or how easy the website was to use .
0	the website is extremely userfriendly and the cart doesn_'_t delete ever , so i can work in the courage to hit the proceed to check out button over some time .
0	the contact center worked very well on all the three_times i used it .
0	also there are always plenty of deals and the emails they send me are mostly interesting and with tailored deals .
0	i found this website through an article in a nationwide new_zealand newspaper , so i knew it could probably be trusted , but i had no idea how easy and great hostelbookers is to use !
0	i love that it tells you if the availability of beds is getting on the scarce side , and love reading_reviews etc .
0	i just booked a hostel for a birthday stay in cardiff , and am now looking at some in vegas for new years .
0	will definitely be booking through hostelbookers again !
0	!
0	i have now had two orders and been delighted with both .
0	delivery and packaging first_class .
0	would recommend most highly .
0	i would recommend julesb to anyone .
0	my boots arrived , beautifully_packaged and it was so quick .
0	the game i ordered arrived quickly with no_problems and was a far better price than on any other site i looked at .
0	i was delighted to receive my order so quickly but was most impressed by the value .
0	after_scouring various_websites for the best deals on my preferred cat_food i have yet to find any as low priced as pet_supermarket .
0	no_problems with delivery , received ok and lovely delivery driver .
0	would use again .
0	really quick delivery , easy to use and make an invitation and brillant quality .
0	shopped_around online for a rug retailer and came_across the rug_house as they were highly visible in search rankings .
0	huge_selection of rugs , all organised into categories for easy shopping .
0	good pictures and descriptions , which helped my purchase decision even_though i was overall unsure_about the wisdom of purchasing a rug online as we were going for quite a large one for the living_room .
0	normally i would have liked to touch / feel / see a purchase like this in store but despite browsing the usual high - street stores online , i didn_'_t find anything close enough to what i was looking for .
0	pricing on rug_house is great too , and they do many more synthetic options than the high_street stores , which i preferred as wool irritates my nose .
0	contacted customer service to ask for some guidance prior to purchasing , and received prompt responses .
0	rug dispatched reasonably quick after purchase and delivered in good shape .
0	happy with the item and would buy again if i ever needed another rug !
0	first time i tried to get_rid of a broken laptop this way .
0	quotation process was straightforward via technologyplanet .
0	i requested quotes from 0 other_companies at the same time but the others were ' automated ' responses whilst tp sent me a ' proper ' email - refreshing , for a change !
0	mainly for this reason , i went with tp and followed the instructions clearly provided in the email on how to send the laptop over to them .
0	my only tiny_gripe was i couldn_'_t find any post_office selling a packaging box for £ 0 ( it was more like £ 0 ), so i think it would be better if this price wasn_'_t listed as a guide .
0	i was only able to post my laptop off a week before christmas , so expected to wait a bit before receiving any response .
0	however , when i emailed mr henderson just to check if the laptop arrived , he was still quick to update me with a status .
0	throughout the process , he was prompt at communicating , despite the long festive holiday .
0	i opted for payment via_bacs and was updated_via_email when this was done .
0	all in all , pretty straightforward process and i '_m_glad we had the option to sell our broken laptop as_opposed to chucking it in the landfill , which would have been more hassle and less rewarding !
0	i '_ve_used this service a few_times .
0	never had a problem at hostels i booked on arrival , the site is easy to navigate and has all the pertinent necessary information i look for when choosing a hostel .
0	rates are the cheapest i '_ve found , and booking is a piece of cake !
0	i recommend it over other hostel reservation sites to my family and friends .
0	keep_up the great work !
0	txtnation '_s services and support are excellent .
0	the future of marketing is going global and txtnation have the systems to help my campaigns run both smoothly and lucratively .
0	thanks !

0	an excellent service , did the job
0	nicole was amazing from the moment we started our live_chat !
0	she found the soultion to my problem quickly and changed my order without_any_problems !
0	she was very polite and i felt completly at ease talking to her !
0	i was skeptical when i realised it was only a live_chat , but this has completly changed my mind .
0	thank_you nicole your cutsomer service was fantastic !
0	i really can '_t rate them high enough .
0	the have great customer service who let you know al the way along the order and delivery process .
0	the daisy glider chair is of superior quality and very sturdy and durable .
0	super easy to put_together since the instructions are so clear , and really comfortable and supportive to sit on .
0	perfect for mums and mums to be and will even last for comfort as your children grow .
0	fast at getting payment .
0	everything done as and when it should have been
0	the wooden toy shop really are a great company .
0	delivery was fast and customer service was excellent .
0	i love the fact that all the products are wooden and so are very long_lasting .
0	the bigjigs town and country train set is fantastic and comes with a big track and lots of accessories which my son loved .
0	their facebook_page is also a great place to join for great reviews , customer service and giveaways .
0	i cannot_fault them at all and will definitely be buying again in the future
0	love the target deals , but i don_'_t love the organization of the site .
0	if a dress comes in 0 colors , why do i need to search for each entry separately ?
0	why can '_t i see all options at once ?
0	makes it a bit frustrating to navigate , but the prices do make it worth it ...
0	since_moving overseas , skype has_been the key to staying in touch with family and friends stateside .
0	i love that i can use it as a substitute for text_messaging ( huge_savings there !
0	), on my phone like it '_s a normal phone_call , or on the computer to see everyone " in person ."
0	such a lifesaver !
0	my daughter sent her i phone 0 after being given a valuation of £_000 .
0	we had not heard from them after a week so logged on to tracker to see that they had reduced the offer to £_00 due to lcd_screen split / phone not working .
0	when i rang i was told email must have gone to junk_mail and if you dont reply in five days they just send revised_offer .
0	i had contacted them the same day the payment was processed and yet my phone had already " gone " and could not be returned to me .
0	i was told phone wasnt working when it got to them .
0	i said i would get bill from t mobile showing phone_calls made day phone was sent .
0	they wouldnt let_me speak to a manager , wouldnt give full names as their " not allowed ".
0	miracuously a supervisor appeared but was no help .
0	i am contacting bbc_watchdog and daily mail for help
0	i had an 0gb iphone_0gs that was a little battered on the outside and scratched but mazuma_mobile said that if it was in full working order , could turn on and off etc then i would receive £_000 and i did !
0	before this i had it valued with envirofone . com who , because of the damaged outside , offered me £_00 , no thank_you .
0	mazuma_mobile are great !
0	my mother was very happy with the flowers and i was very happy with your service .
0	thank_you
0	nadine rawlins
0	the site is amazing there is always something for everyone and great prices also
0	fantatsic company i booked a collection 0am through p0g with tnt the collected same day 0pm service with a smile great rates and great service i will only ever use parcel0go now beats the rest by far
0	i think it '_s easiest to explain_why i have awarded seven_seas one star by pasting my complaint letter here .
0	i never received a reply from them .
0	" it is now the 00th_september , 00 days after my box was collected by you to be shipped from china to the uk , and i have still not received it nor heard_anything from you about its progress .
0	i am very disappointed with the service you have provided throughout this entire shipping process .
0	using seven_seas has certainly not been a simple task .
0	firstly , i did not receive any message_telling_me what time the driver would deliver the empty boxes to me and after several phone_calls it appeared the driver had got my address wrong .
0	secondly , once my box had been collected on the 0th_july i heard_nothing from you to say how much i should pay you , and it was not until i had emailed you twice that i finally got my invoice emailed to me .
0	it was dated the 0th_july , however , i did not receive it until the 00th_july , almost two_weeks after the collection date , causing my payment to be delayed .
0	i subsequently emailed you to say that i was expecting my box to arrive in the uk within 00 days from the 0th_july , otherwise this would cause a huge inconvenience to me .
0	you then assured me that my box was to arrive in the uk on the 00th of august and i was then to allow up to two_weeks for customs .
0	two_weeks has already_passed now and i still have no idea where my box is .
0	i consider the service you have provided to be very poor and completely_unacceptable .
0	i am expecting compensation from you due to the reasons i have highlighted above .
0	i will certainly not be using your company again in the future ."
0	fantastic service , ordered in the evening delivered free by lunch_time the next_day .
0	i have used iflorist many_times to send flowers to the uk and france from where i live in australia because it is my only way of sending presents to people .
0	the flowers have always arrived on time and made the recipient very happy .
0	but this last time in december i ordered flowers for christmas_present for my mum and they never arrived .
0	i contacted the so called live_chat to try and find out what happened and was given a tracking_link that made no sense as it was a lot of destinations in holland and france with a final_destination being 00km from my mums home .
0	i florist have sent flowers here many_times so i assumed they used a local_florist .
0	this time the flowers had been sent by a courier across europe in a van to my mum and never arrived !!!
0	the live_chat kept cutting me off telling they had been been received even_though i told them twice they hadn_'_t .
0	i decided to email iflorist instead , after trying 0 times they finally replied and told me exactly the same rubbish that they had been delivered and they reeled off the address where they had been delivered to which was my mums but that someone called calles had signed for them !!
0	i explained that no - one called calles lives at my mums house so they must have gone somewhere_else .
0	i was then told there was nothing they could do and was given a customer service number to ring .
0	again , i rang and spoke to someone and explained the same thing again !
0	this person was polite unlike everyone else who i had dealt_with , they took my number and said they would ring back and find out what had happened and they never called me .
0	when he took my number i explained that it was an australian mobile and he needs to use the code and he said " yeh , yeh , yeh , i know what to do " which made me think immediately that he had no_intention of ringing me back !
0	so after_contacting iflorist 0 times i have still not received a refund or redelivery .
0	since i spoke to them my mum rang me to say on 00th_january_0000 , which was nearly 0_weeks_later she received a delivery of dead , slimy flowers and the delivery person did not request a signature !
0	so after all the lies that i have been given about the flowers being signed for by someone at my mums house , they arrive dead !
0	if iflorist advertise to send international flowers they should be able to find out when there is a problem with delivery .
0	what has obviously happened is the flowers have been delivered by a courier across europe and over the busy christmas_period been lost and left somewhere ... then delivered after christmas .
0	i would like my £_00 . 00 back please iflorist , your customer service is appalling and unfair .
0	it is very difficult to contact people from australia so would have appreciated a bigger effort .
0	or just a refund when i told you they never arrived .
0	i ordered some flowers for my mum today for mothers_day and i am more than happy with the condition the package turned_up in .
0	my mum absolutely_loves the too .
0	i will be using the company again
0	everything was explained_clearly , with as much care and attendion to details to make the whole_transaction go smoothly .
0	from the moment i logged on , to the moment i got the money for my phone , each section was eplained , worked well and very understandable .
0	it was also a swift service , which was great !
0	!
0	jobs a good ' un !
0	postage envolope came day after ordering , payment in my bank 0_days after , even with xmas . emails to kept me updated .
0	overall great sevice would always recommend , will deff use again .
0	ive been on o0 for as long as i can remember and it has just got better and better providing me with personalised rewards and chances to win things .
0	i can get the benefit form dressni . com .
0	and i believe you can get benefit there too .
0	i have booked numerous hostels now for my interrailing trip and it couldn_'_t have been easier !
0	the site is easy to navigate , you can see how central a hostel is and how it is rated by others !
0	also always the lowest_prices , lower_than hostel_world :)
0	i orderd my items a bit late as i had a last_minute party booking and needed supplies , so i chose the next_day delivery option but ordered after 00 . 00 which ment i had to wait_until the day after as deliveries have to be processed before 00 . 00 ... and then put my party date on the order too as requested .
0	they obviously saw the date and felt it would be helpfull to send them earlier for me , and they were delivered to me next_day !
0	thank_you partyrama , it helped out alot and the function flowed alot better thanks to you !
0	:)
0	shara smith
0	west_sussex .
0	excellent service and very quick turn_around james and oliver both very professional , would definitely use watchfinder again .
0	jade
0	liverpool
0	love it ... items always as_described , always fast delivery and always more than happy with the cost !
0	only_suggestion ; we need a missguided app for iphone !!
0	i would definitely prob spend more on missguided if it was an easily_accessible app !
0	it '_s quite hard to see the items quickly and clearly on the desktop website when your on the iphone .
0	easy to order on - line , next_day delivery , reasonable_prices .
0	i have asked several_times about the elimis tri - enzyme resurfacing serums ( there is more than one since i have 0 different_kinds ) and i either get told there is only the one or that there are 0 .
0	while the 0 is great , i still don_'_t know which one is called tri - enzyme resurfacing serum 0 and 0 .
0	it seems that the people in customer service don_'_t either .
0	otherwise i love the product .
0	just wish i could find what i '_m looking for .
0	it was so fast and easy and not to mention it has a huge_selection of different hostels , hotels , apartments and so on to choose from !
0	will definitely book with hostelbookers . com again !
0	first time i '_d bought specs online and was reassuring to be able to speak to someone on the phone to check some of details in my order .
0	glasses arrived within 0_days .
0	the site was so easy to view and look at all the different hostels and laid_out in a way you find what you want straight_away .
0	would use again , for sure !
0	we werent very happy with the flight , is a good price at the beginning but then it comes all the extras ..
0	very expensive , they even charge for their headphones adaptor £ 0 is a rip_off !
0	we went to mexico , so flight of 00_hours you need a lot if food to buy then .. we did get the menu but it wasnt enough .
0	i paid for my seats as extra aswell and they said i didnt ( even_tho i checked my bank_account and they took it ), the lady at the airport so rude pushing and very insistent and that i didnt .. so i didnt get the seats i was 000_% sure i booked (£_00 lost there ) i want my money back from that !
0	the worst was that they charge you £_00 per_person on your way out from the airport to come_back !
0	it has to be in mexican pesos , cash , no receipts , they take your itinerary before you leave .
0	this sounds_like a scam !!!
0	why dont they charge you for that before hand , sounds_like cheating , stealing . mis just wrong .
0	i spoke to the " secretaria de turismo " ( tourist board ) and they dont even know what i was talking_about !
0	total_scam .
0	hotel was ok but after evaluating and compering , the package wasnt cheap as we thought it was .
0	we end up speanding an extra £_000 between flights to london to be able to fly form their airline , hotel in london because their flight is super early , foods , seats , transport from and to hotel - airport both locations , i can continue ...
0	i will never book another holiday with them .
0	i booked a car in cancun airport with sixt and nobody showed up to pick me up , they have no office in the actual airport .
0	afterr 0_hr with my voucher and reference_number nobody know about the damn car , so i hire directly from hertz which was excellent .
0	rentalcars . com or traveljigsaw which is the same , didnt give me a refund for not giving me the service , thats stealling !
0	they charge me full_amount and after 0_months im still trying to get my money back !
0	the dispute still on , but i will never ever rent a car from this company again .
0	they suck .. save_yourself from this nightmare .
0	i found this site a number of years_ago as i was tired of paying airport premiums .
0	the site works by people subscribing to offer their parking_space to people who need to park their car , so correspondence is in the hands of the subscribers .
0	luckily my contact was great .
0	simple to book and check_availability and a bargain price .
0	happy to leave my car in a safe location , looked after and paying a small price .
0	i hope this site grows into a popular choice for travellers .
0	bargain holidays from independent travel_agents promoting great holiday packages are great prices .
0	don_'_t dismiss this site - i '_ve been on numerous holidays through this site with no_problems at all .
0	it '_s just a very easy site to use to search for good priced holidays .
0	absolutely unacceptable customer service delivered through 0 of the leeds based stores .
0	it seems in store staff are untrained ????
0	when speaking to customers you should be sympathetic to their needs and not simply patronise customers for not understanding something .
0	i would definitely never recommend halford stores in leeds for anything to do with cycles !!!
0	shocking customer service and extremley poor support from the head_office too !
0	what a great find - i bought unlimited_broadband from be there for just £ 0 . 00 a month in 0000 .
0	it since rised in cost but due to loyalty , was awarded the original price for a further 0_months .
0	never had a service outaged , it never seems to peak to cause any trouble and the after sales and customer service team are brilliant .
0	i deal with the online_chat_facility and get things sorted instantly - for instance the deal above .
0	i '_d recommend to anyone .
0	as i was making my order on the online designer , it went fine .
0	i then got an_email_saying that i had to send my order through email and i had to explain to them what i wanted , as the design wouldn_'_t work for some bizarre reason .
0	i first ordered a medium top , and it turned_out to be a size 0 !!
0	when on the store it said a medium was 00 / 00 .
0	i then worte to them , complaining and they offered to send me one in a larger_size .
0	so i ordered an extra large top , which was meant to be a size 00 , turns_out to be a size 00 !
0	!
0	once i recieved the second top , the top is very see - through , the material is stiff and the printing is awful !
0	where the image stretches across my chest , it is all jagged and looks terrible !!
0	!
0	i booked a hotel through booking . com for myself and my 0 friends the cost when booking was £_000 in total so i took £_000 each off my friends , when i booked , the hotel took a £_000 . 00 deposit to secure the rooms / first night however i was expecting them to take the full_amount straight_away , this is not made clear on the website that it would not be all taken straight_away .
0	when i called the customer service department the operator made me feel like i was stupid not knowing that i would have to pay the remaining_balance on the day at the hotel at the exchange_rate given by the hotel .
0	when arriving at the hotel i was told that i had to pay £_000 to make up the full bill so £_000_+ £_000 = £_000 an extra £_00 more then when i actually booked the hotel on the website !
0	i felt like an_idiot so i didn_'_t ask the girls for anymore money so have forked out the extra £_00 myself .
0	i booked through booking . com because it worked out £ 0 per_person cheaper however i was not aware that they do not take they full payment straight_away so i am now out of pocket and i will not be booking through booking . com again .
0	boohoo is an amazing website with awesome clothes and the customer service is great !
0	thanks boohoo !

0	this company needs to get their act_together , i '_ve been tracking my parcel from the beginning of when it got shipped , as soon as it hit this uk_based company things just went to the dogs !
0	they can '_t find my parcel when the status said they tried to deliver it the day before and i was home the hold day no ups , rang them i was promised 000_% my parcel will get delivered the next_day as i stressed it was important i received it .
0	the next evening still no parcel , rang again !
0	for them to tell me they are sorting it out to with the driver .
0	( at 0pm !!!)
0	they told me they will call back , no one called so rang again now the 0th time .
0	some useless customer service lady tells_me the package was not scanned .
0	i told her i '_ve been tracking this package over a week and it said each time scanned how can she tell me it '_s not scanned ?
0	and their status kept changing untruthfully saying i said .
0	told me there isn_'_t nothing i could do or nothing she could do .
0	i have to call the sender .
0	i told her it is friday_evening the sender must be close until monday .
0	she had the nerve to tell me phone them on monday then .
0	i a rude tone .
0	i just hang up it didn_'_t make_sense keep talking to that useless woman .
0	i found their customer service very poor and ignorant .
0	i '_ve cried so hard .
0	i can '_t_believe_how they treat their customers .
0	never send nothing with them .
0	i don_'_t recommend this company what so ever !
0	i shop a lot online and this company is the worst company i '_ve dealt_with .
0	but experience well learnt .
0	please_avoid them at all cost !
0	i was surprised how quickly everything went through - placed the request in the afternoon one day - the next_day the bag to send it back came through the post - the following_day i received an e_- mail_confirming they had the phones & the following_day after that the cheque was posted through my letter_box !
0	brilliant , would recommend to everyone !
0	!
0	great on - line help from sarah_hayes at parcels to go , she dealt_with the problems i was having booking my collection quickly and efficiently .
0	for everyday essentials and amenities , tesco has it all ( nearly ) and the price is usually cheap and good value for money .
0	it is like having a local corner_shop but one that sells anything and everything and if you like window shopping it '_s always an interesting experience to pop down to the local tesco and just browse_through all the aisles of stuff they have from homewares to outdoor camping_gear and diy .
0	i appreciate there are other dedicated stores for these types of products , but having it so local is convenient and it doesn_'_t fee like a chore to go out of your way to find those products .
0	then you have your groceries and it goes without saying that tesco is on top of its game in that respect too - but i do like to vary my shopping between tesco and morrisons for groceries .
0	if you love shopping , superstoresearch . com is your friend - it is one of my favourite shopping sites because you can buy virtually anything through that site and because it shows you the prices from other_retailers , both from the high_street and online only stores , you know that the information is impartial and there to give you the best deal regardless of who is selling it the cheapest .
0	i also found the buying guides to be really helpful because they are concise , well_laid_out and get straight to the point - which is just what i need when i '_m in a hurry and need some advice on buying something like a new_washing_machine ( i don_'_t want to read a phd thesis !)
0	and you can see the ' trends ' list in each_category to know which brands are most_popular and although i do agree that popularity doesn_'_t always equal better , but it can be a general guide to know which washing_machine brand is hot so you can investigate it further to see what all the hype is about .
0	overall this is one of the best shopping sites , i can spend hours on there and not realize the time fly by .
0	what keeps me coming_back the most however is the ' bargains of the day ' section because you can really see some big savings like 00_%_off and they are just too good to pass by - great for shopping but watch out if you have an addiction because this will just fuel it further .
0	absolutely_brilliant .
0	very reasonable quote , no_fuss at all .
0	packaging came promptly and all i had to do was put my phone in the box and post it .
0	money was in my bank three_days_later .
0	would definitely recommend .
0	this is the first time i '_ve actually bothered to review an online shopping website !
0	but thats because it was awesome !
0	bought my idc crew pack from these_guys .
0	ordered it thursday_night .
0	received monday_morning .
0	contained everything , wrapped up nicely .
0	very impressed .
0	( won_'_t lie , was very worried at spending 000_quid on the pack from a ' random ' website .
0	i tend to use amazon !)
0	so damn good job watersports_warehouse !
0	and thank_you :)
0	went in store to ask a few questions about what deals / tariffs they have got and the staff_member said , " just a minute " looked away and started talking to his friend at the counter , 0 minutes later i was walking down the road .
0	thoroughly distgusted .
0	it was a quick and easy to use website , with good pricing .
0	i will use again ...
0	i regularly use viovet because their prices are the most competitive , their check - out is fast and easy , and delivery is free with most orders and is usually next_day .
0	any_problems i '_ve had ( with the courier , not viovet ) have been dealt_with quickly and efficiently by the customer service team .
0	am sure they '_ll continue to be my first choice pet_food supplier .
0	efficient would certainly buy from again very quick delivery and certainly well_packaged highly_recommend
0	very trustworthy and thorough would highly_recommend service next_day delivery as promised with out any complications or problems thanks
0	honest through efficient and trustworthy next_day deliver would start recommending to my family thanks

0	i couldn_'_t find a better pharmacy than this it has helped_me a great deal in fast timing no judgement precise in medical_questionnaire when my medication arrived i couldn_'_t get over the packaging they did everything to prevent it being damaged or tampered in transit i would certainly highly_recommend this pharmacy it very much legitimate thank_you so much for the wonderful experience and confidence to re - order my prescription well_done i higkh applaud them :)
0	i must_say this company has never ever let_me down .
0	dispatch time was quick and delivery in less_than 0_days to ie very impressive updated me all the way .

0	johnny walker blue label with personalised engraved message on the bottle .
0	i had expected this product to be good , but the quality that arrived surpassed these expectations .
0	a fantastic gift , quickly dispatched , for the discerning whiskey_drinker .
0	one stop_shop for all those little pet gadgets i '_d been meaning to buy for a while .
0	not only that but competitively_priced with prompt dispatch and delivery .
0	i can '_t fault the service .
0	printerland always deliver an excellent service .
0	prices are competetive and delivery is always prompt .
0	i would highly_reccommend printerland to anyone .
0	i have taken prince0 coure from e_- careers and it was just great .
0	the " lectures " are clear and very understandable , you can review them and listen as many_times as you need .
0	i would deffinitely recommend it to everyone .
0	customer service is top_class as well .
0	i did speak to them few time on their chat and i never had to wait for longer_than few seconds .
0	kathy who is customer relationship executive was also very helpful .
0	i did have few questions_regarding my course and certificate and she helped_me immidiately .
0	more people like this !
0	im also thinking_about taking another course from e_- careers .
0	very glad we used housenetwork as our estate_agents , because of it being online it is affordable , but you would think the communication would be less but it wasn_'_t , we were given our own advisor with a direct line who always took our calls and did above and beyond her job we feel . my advisor at housenetwork felt the frustration on my side with the sale of our property and for our buyers , on both_sides things were moving extremely slowly , kayleigh helped with chasing up phonecalls to both_sides of solicitors and helping_me out on a regular sometimes daily_basis to get things moving for us before the purchase of our new home came into trouble .
0	i would definitely use housenetwork again and i would recommend them immediately on anyway asking me .
0	angela .
0	i am over the moon with the work jilly has done for me removing objects and people from the background of a photo , the work was done quickly and a very reasonable_price .
0	i would not_hesitate to recommend to family and friend .
0	thanks jilly :)
0	i routinely order flowers from australia to send to my friends and family in the uk , the website is so easy to navigate .
0	the quality of the product is great and is more than value for money .
0	my now husband purchased my engagement_ring from diamondgeezer . com .
0	it was beeautiful unique , just perfect !
0	the service since the purchase has_been second to none , even 0 years down the line they continue to provide a fantastic service for us !!!
0	x
0	the quality is also perfect , my wedding_ring bought elsewhere as we were given some vouchers has alreadt had to be redipped after only a year , my engagement_ring however , from diamondgeezer is still perfect x
0	e_- careers is a great place to learn .
0	the courses and training packages are very extensive , just like been taught in a classroom .
0	i loved it so much that i am enrolling for another course and my partner is taking a course as well .
0	a trial will convince you .
0	i recently had terrible damp in my house , so i used the trusatrader . com website after_seeing the advert on tv .
0	the builder i chose was extremely nice and helpful and explained_everything to me because i dont have a clue about these things !
0	the job was soon fixed and i was left extremely happy with a nice smelling and dry house !
0	i needed to buy some headphones for my local pre_- school and hifiheadphones were the best for price , range of products and p_&_p costs .
0	as soon as i had ordered them , i was kept up to date with my order every_step of the way and i even received them the very next_day .
0	excellent service , i will definitely be using you again .
0	i ordered flowers to be delivered on a very specific day .
0	on the day , i was sent a nice email_saying they were out for delivery .
0	they never appeared , there was no email_saying that the flowers had not been delivered , there was no phone_call .
0	00_hours_later , the flowers were left at the back door .
0	customer service are hopeless , can not tell you what happened , have no accountability and send you the same tired email time after time .
0	this company is a joke , go elsewhere .
0	ordering was easy , my delivery was quick and communication over an issue with an incompatible cartridge was extremely_helpful and speedily resolved .
0	i will definitely be a returning_customer .
0	many_thanks to steve for all his help .
0	i found the website very easy to use and my items came 0 week after i ordered .
0	excellent quality wedding_invitations at a reasonable_price .
0	bargain .

0	great prices and the item turns_up the next_day !
0	its incredible , always great for last_minute gifts .
0	would definitely recommend
0	love using hostelbookers . com it is so easy and informative to use .
0	used it for several_years and definately recommend it .
0	i ordered and paid for a tunic on 0th_september , expecting delivery in the following week .
0	by the end of september it still hadn_'_t arrived so i sent an_email , followed_by a phone_call to the office .
0	it is now the 00th_october and i have had no replies to the 0 emails i have sent and no one has bothered to contact me following the two calls i have made - i assured someone would look into it and call me back .
0	i will_continue to chase this !
0	i wanted to get_rid of my old lap_top and had searched on ebay and didn_'_t think there was much chance of getting much for it , and didn_'_t really want the hassle .
0	took a quick look at a few sites for recycling laptops , and sell your lap_top seemed to offer the best price .
0	was a really easy process , no additional_costs of postage - could have arranged courier pick_up for free but i opted to post it myself ( cost covered by the company ) as this was more convenient .
0	my laptop arrived the next_day - i received a confirmation_email , and the following_day the full quoted price was in my account .
0	couldn_'_t have been simpler .
0	i would definately recommend .
0	i brought a world of warcraft mouse for my other_halfs birthday , paid next_day delivery .
0	arrived in great condition , worked great .
0	i will use box . co . uk again .
0	x
0	i sent my phones in to mazuma but relised a few hours_later that i hadnt put in the order form , i rang them and the lady i spoke to was very helpful and sorted it out for me , and i recieved the money into my bank a few_days_later .
0	i will_definatly use mazuma again .
0	i bought a pair of trainers and unfortunately they didn_'_t fit my boyfriend .
0	when i tried to exchange them i was a few_days over their 00 day policy .
0	i foolishly purchased online without reviewing the policy but presumed they would be in line with their main_competitors .
0	this was not the case ......
0	so now i have a pair of trainers that won_'_t fit and even although they are still a current line they have refused to exchange them !
0	better customer service can definitely be found elsewhere !
0	i was a bit_dubious using this sort of website but after spekaing to a friend who used mazuma i was convinced that they were legit .
0	the service was first_class from_start to finish .
0	i was offered a great price , able to send it back for free and the money was transferred_into my account the day after my phone was received !
0	i would recommend iit to everyone !
0	absolutely fantastic customer service - you place your order thinking realistically , it will be with you in a couple of days - but it always_arrives the next_day !!
0	can '_t get better_than that !
0	also , if there '_s ever been a query ( i can only think of one occasion ) their customer service team are straight onto it !
0	!
0	very pleased with this company and will_continue to use them and recommend them :)
0	super_fast transaction and money transfer ,..., no_problems what so ever .
0	i highly_recommend mazuma as a way of selling an old phone .
0	most hen_parties involve cheap hotels and girls paired off , the house was great as it brought us all closer together and it was beautiful , clean , with everything we needed and really close to town .
0	the cocktail_making was a brilliant activity to get the day / night and the addition of the topless barman absolutely made our day !
0	;)
0	everything was really well_organised which made it so much_easier for a group that had never ventured to brighton before , and can '_t thank clare and the other girls enough for all their help with the details .
0	will definitely come_back to brighton , and will definitely recommend my big_fat brighton_weekend to anyone who_asks
0	thanks so much again !!

0	i was sent an offer through and even_though i had had a bad customer service experience with them previously decided i would give them another try .
0	i put in my offer code which they said may not show straight_away but would be applied to my statement ....
0	however , when i received my statement i have been charged in full .
0	i rang customer service and was told to email .... why when i am talking to you ?????
0	they then said that the offer code was on spends of £_00 + but no one on the ' online ' voucher was this states i read these things carefully .
0	i now interestingly cannot access this ' online voucher '.
0	i feel that they dangle carrots and then do not follow through ... this to me is fraudulant ... there customer service is appalling .
0	if you ' re organising a hen_do or weekend away , i would definitely recommend using chilli_sauce .
0	our rep was sam and organised a great dance class and a fab night out in newcastle .
0	paying everything was so much_easier than one person having to chase everyone and everything was booked and ready for us that weekend .
0	definitely highly_recommended !
0	highly_recommended
0	highly_reccomend this company , just received payment less_than 00hrs after they got my fone . they received yesterday and money was in today .
0	couldnt be_happier , do not_hesitate to use thiscompany .
0	great service .
0	sent a blackberry_0000 almost 0_weeks_ago . was told payment would be made today ( 00st_jan ) still no payment !
0	ridiculous seeing as they said 0 working_days !
0	appauling customer service .... also says on site on my account not paid . before they say they have !.......................
0	latest update , they emailed to say money would be in bank today as promised !
0	! with a 0 pound goodwill_gesture on top ( why thankyou .. not ).
0	still no money !
0	! and have re - emailed them0 times !!

0	friend from california sent me a gift of a photo on 0 / 00 / 00 .
0	on 00 / 00 i receive a note from parcelforce demanding import vat and a clearance fee ( the latter being £_00 . 00 ).
0	no pay , no delivery .
0	fine .
0	i followed their instructions , went to their website , paid the toll , and arranged for next_day delivery .
0	nothing turned_up .
0	and nothing has as i write nearly a month later .
0	i just rang to complain , chose the option to speak to a real_person and was immediately disconnected !
0	tried again , got shown the exit again .
0	utterly dispiriting service , like the worst of the0000s .
0	parcelforce would seem to be the antithesis of what the privatised royal_mail say their standards are .
0	i had replacement lenses from thinlenses . co . uk a year_ago and i have just had new lenses fitted by them into new , expensive , frames brought elsewhere for which i didn_'_t fancy paying through the nose for the optics .
0	they ' re straightforward to deal with .
0	just because they ' re vastly more competitive on price than the high_street doesn_'_t mean the work , materials , communication , and service is of a lower standard .
0	on the contrary , they ' re very good in all_respects .
0	although i would hate to see the town_centre without opticians , i can '_t think why one should pay so much for the same product .
0	sometimes high_st opticians service can be over - fussy and cloying too .
0	the high_street opthamologists really need to broaden the services they offer at more competitive_prices .
0	and , if you required more incentive , returning customers to thinlenses get 00_percent off their next bill .
0	that means the high index_lenses i had in my recent frames were £_000 cheaper_than what a nationwide ' budget ' optician fanchise quuoted .
0	they could improve , by selling top - end designer_frames .
0	that would make them competitive all_round .
0	but i doubt such manufacturers are prepared to discount .
0	great deals . very cheap and lovely villas . homes ect
0	hi , i typed to catherine on the livechat feature on the website and she was very helpful and answered my question very quickly .
0	cheers catherine :)
0	purchased a mobility_scooter for my nan from careco .
0	> careco were brilliant at advising which mobility scooters were best for her .
0	> the staff were friendly and helpful .
0	no hard_sell .
0	> the scooters were great value for money , far better_than any other_companies we looked at .
0	> the scooter arrived 0_days after purchase .
0	> i highly_recommend careco .
0	i would definately use this outlet again after_comparing_prices in various shops i found this to be the cheapest by far very happy with my purchase .
0	the only_regret i have is that i didn_'_t start using this site sooner .
0	for people reading this and thinking " how much did you spend !?"
0	i spent only about £ 0000 to receive £_000 cash_back as there are some free cash_back offers ( no purchase ), plus i love financial products so i received majority of my cash_back applying applying for best credit_cards , bank_accounts and isaa ( nisas ).
0	i also love the increasing choice of partners where i can redeem my cash_back .
0	i mostly take it as m & s or amazon_vouchers , but there are so many other choices ( boots , love0shop , ba miles ).
0	i recommended topcashback to so many friends and the ones that signed_up are really happy with the site and free money for shopping .
0	the ones that did not listed to me are loosing out on free cash : 0 ).
0	once i ordered a mattress from a different company , which took nearly a month to arrive and was not that comfortable .
0	when i heard about memory_foam mattresses i decided to replace mine .
0	i was amazed that memoryfoamwarehouse delivers next_day
0	i was really pleased with both customer_services and the memory_foam_mattress that i got .
0	i received the mattress next_day after ordering it ( as promised )
0	the mattress is really comfortable , 00 months later it is still as new .
0	ordered 0000 water_bottles .
0	we were struggling to find a company to turn them around as quick as we needed them .
0	promo gifts stepped in and we got our order on time and they look great !
0	nature '_s best have been fantastic from the start .
0	they set_up shipping all the way to korea just for me , they '_ve answered numerous health questions , recommended products , provided free_samples and they '_ve always replied very quickly to any_queries i '_ve had .
0	their products are great - believe me i take a lot of them !
0	i wouldn_'_t buy vitamins / minerals from anyone_else .
0	hostel_bookers are excellent .
0	they show an excellent range of hostels for a range of budgets .
0	the information provided for each_hostel is excellent and they give you lots of up - to - date customer reviews so you know what they hostel is like first hand .
0	the booking process itself is a breeze .
0	i '_ll definitely use hostel_bookers again !
0	i had no idea on how i would get my iphone_unlocked , and once i found this company , i took a leap a faith and i couldn_'_t be more happy .
0	i will recommend this company to anyone and everyone that needs their iphone_unlocked !!!!
0	thank_you sooooo_much , i will be your personal cheerleader :)
0	the single worst online shopping_experience ever .
0	wish you could give no stars .
0	ordered online , no delivery a week_later .
0	went_onto facebook to ask for an update , apparently a field was left blank so delivery could not be made ( my fault , which i accept ) - however , no contact from thornton '_s or delivery company advising me of this , i had to chase them .
0	i provided them with the information that was required and was assured that delivery would be quick .
0	another week_later and still no delivery and still no update from thornton '_s , except that they we ' re sorry for the experience and they strive for ' excellent customer service '....?!
0	0_days on and still no delivery .
0	demanded refund , but clearly not expecting that to come anytime_soon , nor do i expect to receive any communication about it .
0	have had to make alternative_arrangements now and has turned_out cheaper and better .
0	don_'_t even get me started on the customer service in store as well .
0	for a brand such as thornton '_s they need to sort this out immediately - go onto their facebook and just see the amount of complaints and their distinct lack of adequate complaint resolutions .
0	save your money and go elsewhere .
0	or if you like thornton '_s , buy their chocolate from tesco .
0	i ordered a few items on wednesday 00th_june_0000 and paid for next_day delivery .
0	i was kept_informed_throughout whole_process , my order was delivered on thursday 00th_june_0000 at around 0am , by a lovely delivery driver .
0	i was given options brought text and email to rearrange my delivery if needed too !
0	so much_better_than other_companies i have used in past few_days !
0	will definitely use again !
0	thank_you for your excellent service !
0	!
0	i ordered a few items from a clothing company who use yodel as their couriers .
0	big mistake on their part , i probably_won_'_t use this clothing company again whilst they continue to use yodel .
0	my order was paid for , for express delivery and according to yodels website , was due to be delivered on 00 . 0 . 00 .
0	it got to 0pm and no delivery .
0	and it was still stating it was in their main service centre .
0	not my local .
0	so i rang .
0	to be told , it '_s possibly lost .
0	they '_ll forward my issue and i '_ll hear back from them , then they hung_up phone .
0	so i waited for them to return my call ( they hung_up instead of transferring me ) i didn_'_t hear back so i rang again .
0	this time i told them that i needed it delivered to my work address the following_day ( i wasn_'_t happy about this .
0	i paid for express delivery for my holiday !!!).
0	the man told me he was making notes and this would be possible .
0	however , told me someone would call me to sort it tomorrow and only took a postcode to check this was in same catchment area .
0	next_day , i waited for a call .
0	no call !
0	i rang again !
0	now they ' re telling_me there '_s no address on my parcel , only the town .
0	( this was lies , i got thr parcel eventually and there is an address !).
0	i gave them details and told them it needed to be delivered before 000pm to work address .
0	0pm arrives .
0	i ring to find out the status of my delivery .
0	the man has complete attitude !
0	saying well it '_s only 0pm .
0	obviously ( he said this ).
0	it won_'_t be there yet .
0	i was fuming .
0	000pm arrives .
0	no parcel again .
0	i ring again .
0	now they give me couriers number .
0	the courier hadn_'_t been told to deliver to my work address , despite me telling 0 different people where it was to go !!!
0	unfortunately , the courier lady was lovely , so it '_s not her fault , but yodel as a company are useless !
0	i am awaiting contact about 0 different complaints i have made regarding their poor customer service .
0	and the attitude of their employees .
0	the one with attitude ) only started apologising once i told him i want to make a complaint about him .
0	but it '_s fine , because all calls are recorded , so they will be able to see !
0	avoid yodel !
0	yodel are quick enough to check these reviews , but not quick enough to sort_out any complaints or issues they cause !
0	i ordered 0 items from them , on 0 . 0 . 00 .
0	it is now 00 . 0 . 00 and according to their website , my items are in progress .
0	so they haven_'_t even been packaged , let_alone sent out !
0	i emailed three_times , and rang twice .
0	to which i have had no reply .
0	their phone just claims there is no one to take your call .
0	this is a complete scam company .
0	they took my money quick enough and straight_away !
0	i '_m lucky i paid through paypal as i '_m opening a dispute !
0	do not use this company .
0	you will lose out !
0	lovely chocolates , and they were delivered quickly and safely .
0	the packaging would have protected against any bumps but it could have been more eco_friendly .
0	good , but i '_m jealous of the movie deals from orange at the moment
0	couldn_'_t be more happy with the service .
0	the voucher and envelope were delivered so quickly , and i received nearly doubled the amount envirophone offered me .
0	definitely recommend !
0	bought a nice sony laptop off the website .
0	good value , cheaper_than amazon by about 000 !
0	i always liked sainsburys anyway , better_than tesco or asda .
0	i love john_lewis , the stuffs good and the service is great !
0	they made me curtains and they look gorgeous .
0	i bought my new sony telly off them as the service is briulliant , it '_s chaper than buyiomg insurance .
0	i love them !
0	over 00 months the tv didn_'_t work , the internet was on and off and they charged to fix it and then it still didn_'_t work > cost me 000 to reconnect my phone line after they put it on their own line > a really bad_experience >
0	i wrote to them at_least ten times and all they said was " tough " well tough on you tiscali , here '_s my review of you
0	love the phone and love orange wednesday but hate the website .
0	hard to log on and look at your stuff , improve your website orange !
0	i love wiggle > fast delivery and good prices .
0	bought onew thing wrong and they took it back no problem .
0	everything i need for my bike i buy from them !
0	i love the co op !
0	always have !
0	excellent value and morals .
0	i use the bank as well and get points on my card !
0	they also pay dividends , foods good , banking is excellent !
0	what a grteat business , helpful , full of jokes and great on the phone .
0	everything in stock , or they tell you it will be a few_days !
0	they don_'_t take your money until the goods have left their shop , that '_s really unusual !
0	i recommend them to anybody !
0	amazing company cheapest around fast delivery

0	the images are clear and you are offered all angles and video of product to help decide .
0	the service was fast and efficient , and they had great communication .
0	very recommended .
0	ebay makes it easy to buy and sell , the fees are reasonable and the customer service is brilliant .
0	its an easy to use website , with fast service and payment .
0	i would really recommend the service .
0	excellent service and prompt payment .
0	i would recommend this company to anyone - they do much_better deals for recycling your mobiles than other similar companiesaking to a friend .
0	my partner bought my engagement_ring from marlows , we vvisited pretty_much all of the shops in the jewelry quarter and this was by far the best shop , for price , service and their quality of rings .
0	the staff were extremely_helpful .
0	we also bought our_wedding_bands from here to and got a great deal .
0	since buying my engagement_ring i have been back twice to get mtg ring cleaned and polished - free of charge and my ring has come_back looking more beautiful and sparkly than ever !

0	thanks jilly .

0	we have used visualsoft for over 0 years and they now feel like family .
0	kissika is the third site in which visualsoft have built for us and they just get better and better .
0	i would strongly_recommend them to anyone who asked .
0	:-)
0	i do all my travel bookings online and like to keep things as simple as possible .
0	hostelbookers helps me find exactly_what i need , make_sure i know everything about it before booking , and then if there are any_issues their great customer service responds promptly .
0	i don_'_t have a lot of money to waste and i like to make_sure when planning a trip for work or fun that i am getting the best deal .
0	i particularly_like the variety of establishments available to book from hb .
0	i was really pleased with the website and having ordered my item thursday_night ( with no special delivery ) i was surprised to see it in the post saturday_morning .
0	faster_than most companies , will order from them again .
0	highly_recommended
0	the site was easy to use and ordering was very easy .
0	i ordered quite late in the day and still had next_day delivery which was great .
0	i was notified whent he flowers had been delivered and they are gorgeous .
0	great service at a very reasonable_price , thanks .
0	i made an order on the 0th_october_0000 , it '_s now january_0000 and i still_haven_'_t received the whole order .
0	part of what i did receive was damaged due to poor packing .
0	it was food but the packaging was ripped_open so it was mouldy !
0	i have tried_calling waeplus but there is never anyone on the phonelines and all my emails are met with silence .
0	according to their website i can '_t have a refund whilst the order is ' partially delivered '.
0	however , i think that waiting for 0_months is enough time to ask for a refund .
0	the service has_been terrible and i feel like they are ignoring me so that they will not have to give me a refund - an easy way to make money !
0	update_:
0	they finally got in touch with me in january , and said i could have a refund for the undelivered items but not the damaged items ( unless i posted them back - they were food items and i threw them out after a couple of weeks as i didn_'_t fancy hanging on to mouldy food ).
0	in april i received a cheque , made out to the wrong name .
0	they are either trying really hard not to give me any money back or are just incompetent .
0	i have been shopping around for some time to find great deals on supplements , today i stumbled_upon supplementwarehouse . com !
0	i am so impressed by all the products they have , how easy their website is , and especially the prices of their supplements .
0	i cannot wait to recieve my order !
0	i will definitely be using them again for my future_purchases !
0	i ordered a framed canvas_print for my boyfriend as a surprise christmas_present .
0	hellocanvas were very helpful and my print was with me in a couple of days - much_faster_than i was expecting !
0	now i just have to wait_until christmas to see if my boyfriend_loves it as much as i do .
0	thank_you !
0	like the last reviewer i have never written an online review of a company before so goes to show how angry i am at the service i have received , i only wish i '_d seen all the bad_reviews before i chose to use them and saved_myself from being completely ripped_off
0	i have recycled two iphones in the past with a different company and received perfect service , received exactly the same amount i was quoted and received my money quickly .
0	i chose to use bozowi this time because it offers the highest_amount and claims the same level of service i have received before - do not be_fooled you will not receive this amount for your phone !
0	my phone was sent off in good condition , followed all of the critieria for a fully working phone iphone_0s in good condition and i was quoted £_000 . 00 - i have received ( although its not actually in my account yet ) £_000 because it was locked to o0 - this was not made clear to me when i entered the contract and i can see from reviews on here that they have only just changed their website this week to say that .
0	i spoke to a guy in customer_services who also said their terms and conditions had been changed on the website this tuesday 00th_march - my contract was formed on the 00th_february
0	the thing that has made me even more angry is that i was supposed to receive an_email from them with the revised_offer of £_000 which i never received so i did not have the opportunity to decline their offer and get my phone back .
0	they claim to have emailed me although my it department have traced all emails and would be notified if anything was blocked for whatever_reason and nothing has tried to come through from them - i received my confirmation_email from them no problem but conveniently this one never arrived in my inbox or even made it to the server .
0	bozowi customer_services response to this was that it is my responsibilty to make_sure my email is working and i had 0_days to accept or decline to the email i never received so it is my problem .
0	i agree that my email is my responsibility which is why i had emailed them to tell them i hadn_'_t heard_anything from them and asked what was going on with my account - this email was sent to them within the 0_days they were supposed to wait for me to accept or decline the offer so they basically knew i hadn_'_t received the email but continued to process it anyway ?
0	one of the three people i spoke to at customer_services confirmed that they had received my email so i know this is not another suposed problem with email
0	so in summary , i have received a ridiculously_cheap price for my phone nowhere_near the quote i agreed to and through no fault of my own have no option to get my phone back and have to just accept this .
0	i made them aware i hadn_'_t received any emails from them and they did nothing , a decent company would see my email , re send the offer email and possibly extend the 0 day rule knowing there had been problems .
0	my phone has now been sent somewhere_else apparently and they can '_t get it back .
0	don_'_t even get me started on the people they have representing their customer_services - i wasted 0 hour 00_minutes on the phone to them to get nothing resolved , no apology just them implying that i am lying and it '_s not their problem .
0	at times they spoke with attitude , when i commented that i had been on the phone for 00_minutes the girl replied " no 0 minutes actually " in a rude manner to which i pointed_out she wasn_'_t the first person i had been put through to so infact it was 00_minutes .
0	i consider myself a very honest person so this whole situation has left me infuriated ans the money hasn_'_t even reached my account !
0	not much more i can say !
0	i want to own everything on site !
0	i like the fact that they stock contemporary brands that you can '_t find anywhere_else , it makes the purchase that little_bit more special .
0	0 day breakfast / lunch hamper : the porridge is delicious !
0	i have never been one to use water instead of milk but i am now a saints and slimmers porridge convert .
0	one packet with a little honey gets me right through till lunch !
0	the milkshakes are delicious - i thought they would taste powdery and bitty but i am pleasantly_surprised :)
0	happy customer and will definitely order again :)
0	i ordered a bunch flowers from serenata for my mother , next_day delivery as promised .
0	however , the flowers that came looked nothing like the flowers i ordered .
0	they where a cheap tatty bunch that i could of bought from tesco '_s for £ 0 .
0	i was seriously unhappy with what i received and want my money back as they where not worth the money i spent on them .
0	i will never order flowers from these again , trip to tesco next time .
0	really professional and polite men .
0	great communication and delivered for me on my day off .
0	great prices .
0	thank_you so much .
0	this was absolutely amazing , we ordered and within two_days the tickets were here and was amazing to find out we got some money back !
0	the tickets were reduced an they were so cheap compared to other_sites !
0	the seats were really close to the stage as i sat there for nicki_minaj and i just can '_t wait for justin !
0	thanks double0_tickets !
0	great prices and extremely fast despatch times , even with the free delivery !
0	my order was despatched the same day .
0	will definitely buy from them again .
0	great quality products and fast delivery times !
0	free delivery with style saver which is brilliant and i was even upgraded for a period of time to asos premium for free next_day delivery and returns .
0	cannot_rate this company highly_enough .
0	my favourite place for clothes !
0	always speedy delivery and kept up to date with the order process .
0	i have ordered numerous items from amazon and have never been disappointed .
0	cannot recommend highly_enough .
0	this is the second time i have ordered from this company and my experience this time was worse_than the last .
0	the first item took over a week to dispatch and my second order , placed 00 days ago , has not even been dispatched yet .
0	as a result i would like to cancel my order and have notified the company of this .
0	i am greatly disappointed , especially after_reading all the great reviews on this website .
0	will definitely not be using them again .
0	we had a great weekend at the edge for my sister '_s hen_party .
0	it '_s far enough from town that you get a nicely sized outside area and close enough that buses and taxis are affordable , and walking do - able .
0	very nicely_decorated inside and out .
0	only_downside is lack of parking for a group of our size , but this is the same anywhere in and around brighton and the house itself certainly made up for it !
0	thank_you .
0	i hate o0 , the customer service team are awful are completely incapable of ever following an instructing or assisting in any matter .
0	you continue to be diverted to another area e . g .
0	to contract cancellation team , or the pay monthly , but no one ever seems to be able to help with a situation .
0	i have spent_hundreds on my phone contract .
0	one month i spent over_£_000 . 00 as i was away in south_america .
0	i also had my phone line , my broadband and ipad linked to o0 , and yet they still seem not to value me as a customer , or to execute any basic task i ask them to e . g . help with a broken phone .
0	i '_ve been with them since i had my first ever phone .
0	i hate the fact i am contracted to o0 and am unable to leave without a huge fine .
0	as soon as i am able to get out i will .
0	my family & i keep buying our environ_products from facethefuture because we ' re always impressed with the speedy & free delivery ( i ordered some products yesterday_afternoon and then came this morning ).
0	the customer service staff are always really friendly & eager to offer advice on products and suitable treatments .
0	the products are also cheaper_than_anywhere_else i '_ve come_across , even if other_places are offering discount !
0	i shall_continue to be their client and would recommend their services & environ to anyone !
0	thank_you :)
0	i have a nearly 0 year_old daughter who is obsessed with dinosaurs but find it difficult to find her anything girly with dinosaurs as everywhere presumes it is a boy thing to like !
0	i was thrilled with her dinosaur jumper and she literally won_'_t take it off !
0	i thought sometimes when they use transfers on clothes it can look a bit cheap but this is lively and looks really professional !
0	i was also impressed with the service as on the website it stated it would take 0 working_days to dispatch but i received it only 0_days after ordering !
0	fab service , fab products will_definatley be recommending ( and already have been doing ) and will_definatley be back to order more !!
0	:-)
0	brilliant !
0	i arranged a collection late on the friday_afternoon , they collected on the monday_morning and then the money was in my bank wednesday !
0	couldn_'_t have asked for better service !
0	they do all the hard_work for you !
0	would definatley reccomended !
0	great communication , my bills never have any unexpected charges !!
0	all in all great service !

0	shopping with nitrotek is always fast and easy , the products ordered are always of fantastic quality as is the aftersales help , all in all nitrotek is a very trustworthy and quality company !
0	!
0	received my envelope in the post and sent it and the whole_process was a breeze received my money the next_day .
0	highly_reccomended
0	love the games even the demo games are great .
0	good fast site
0	ordered a trunki as a gift and it arrived the very next_day after ordering it around lunchtime !
0	good email contact letting_me know progress of order too .
0	very impressed and will definitely use bambino_direct again .
0	we ordered a baby backpack from blackleaf .
0	it arrived promptly , packaging was good and we are very happy with the product .
0	would definitely recommend the company to others .
0	purchased some fitflop_trainers for my husband for christmas which he_loves !
0	the price was amazing , delivery was super quick and i was kept_updated on the status of my order throughout .
0	thanks shoetique !
0	i was really impressed with mazuma '_s service - the freepost_envelope arrived the next_day and the money was in my account the day after i sent the phone in and i was kept_informed of progress_throughout .
0	excellent .
0	i will use you again and will recommend you to fiends !
0	booked to usa and got some good tickets , patient people , good prices , was generally very happy .
0	it was let_down by the insurance .
0	i got an annual_policy with them and needed to claim on another trip to france , a few_months later .
0	this was by coach to stansted , to france by ryanair and hire_car to the accommodation in france .
0	unfortunately i fell ill and the insurers sent a form that applied only to a package holiday and tour_operator , not to separately booked segments .
0	it was very , very hard to fill it out since it did not apply to the kind of trip i had taken .
0	but i got a medical certificate saying i '_d been too ill to travel and a letter from the french accommodation saying i hadn_'_t been able to come , and a note that the car_hire in france had not been used , but they still refused to pay out on the coach and ryanair because i couldn_'_t prove i hadn_'_t caught the coach to stansted and i couldn_'_t prove i '_d missed the ryanair flights .
0	my husband was booked with a different insurer and claimed for just the same things as me ( we each claimed 00_percent of the joint items ) but his claim was paid in full .
0	i am really out of pocket due to the inflexibility of this old_fashioned insurance offered by trailfinders and it has quite put me off them .
0	i would have thought they could get a more up to date and flexible insurance , and this definitely did not seem like a good deal to me .
0	their prices are always pretty good , the site is clear , the system is sensible .
0	i have often used this site and never found a problem .
0	expensive , disgracefully disorganised parking , horrible expensive messy food , tatty displays of lego buildings which were originally nice but now not properly maintained , too few staff , long_queues .
0	we and the kids had a really bad day out here - luckily i wasn_'_t paying but a relative was and we all felt upset she had wasted her money , even the kids .
0	wrote to legoland customer_services but just got a bland response which did not address the issues i raised .
0	i '_m amazed_at how many people they get in this park , so it must make financial sense to them to operate like this .
0	so don_'_t expect it to change if you complain , and i doubt it will get better .
0	still , if you want a decent day out go somewhere_else and spend the money on something_else .
0	brilliant , fast and friendly !
0	i was kept up to date throughout the whole_process and i enjoyed the witty one liners on the emails .... will_definately recommend this service to all my friends !!
0	thanks mazumamobile
0	i came_across my big_fat brighton_weekend when looking for an accommodation provider for my sister '_s hen_do weekend .
0	they quickly went straight to the top of the list through their quick communication , responses to queries and reassurance where i wasn_'_t sure what would work best .
0	their properties looked outstanding online and i wasn_'_t at all disappointed when we arrived .
0	twelve of us stayed on sillwood road which was perfectly located and beautifully set_up for a group of girls enabling a fun party atmosphere without_compromising comfort .
0	the roof_terrace was an amazing touch and a lovely surprise for the hen .
0	every_single girl who stayed was beyond complimentary about the house .
0	i have already_recommended the services to others and will do so again .
0	thanks for all your help - a hen_weekend my sister will never forget !
0	very quick and reliable .
0	they provided information on the area where tickets were available and once booked they arrived very shortly_afterwards .
0	definitely recommend them and will use them again in the future
0	movehub . com found its way straight_into my favourites !
0	the wealth of information is phenomenal and to have it all in one place could save so much time .
0	the city rankings are a fantastic idea and provide exactly the type of information that people are interested in when looking to move - particularly to a new country .
0	introducing the people behind movehub is a fantastic personal_touch , and adds a sense of their passion for the site .

0	the item itself was exactly as_described with no_faults and no parts_missing and at a fantastic price with free delivery .
0	cannot_complain_about anything will definitely be using again .
0	lifestyle_furniture were extremely_helpful from the word go and did everything they could to help me with my order .
0	delivery was sooner_than_expected and they even arranged to phone me 00mins before so i didnt have to wait in all day .
0	the furniture itself - 0 pieces from the sheesham collection , is beautiful .
0	i hope we will be adding to it in the not too_distant_future , particularly as it is such good value .
0	order was easy to process and quick to deliver .
0	really happy with the service and they text when i '_m due to re order .
0	marcin knows what he is doing and that the best thing about feedoptimise .
0	he is always there and i would recommend his tool to anyone in need of a similar service .
0	since start , the tool has always been evolving and has so many additional_features attached to it making it a " one - stop - shop " for all your product feed related and everything else attached to it .
0	kudos !.

0	!.
0	best_wishes .
0	excellent service and super_fast !!!
0	:)
0	i will recommend this shop to everyone .
0	due to very intense schooldays i learnt a lot and i still still remember pretty_much everything .
0	the school did not only cover drinks but also flairing and history of spirits which was good .
0	only_thing that could be included in my mind is some winetasting and history etc .
0	also very friendly and helpful teachers and you could buy a barkit at the school .
0	amazing friends from the hostel experience , you all become like a crazy family
0	i couldn_'_t_believe_how annoying this apple stuff is !
0	my phone didn_'_t have the that button and says " well it wouldn_'_t work without that button !"
0	i says that '_s impossible as my phones been fine but now i can '_t get onto wifi .
0	i could never get into 0g either !
0	i never complained and just thought that it was due to the location i was in .
0	now i can '_t even go on wifi and decided to take it out on the wifi company .
0	they asked if my other phones did this and i said " no ".
0	they explained that we have very quick broadband and it wasn_'_t their problem .
0	i decided to ask apple_store itself .
0	they found that apple hasn_'_t even activated the 0g network and told me to call o0 .
0	but after that phone_call - their customer service is awful !
0	they gave_me such a talk about a settings that wasn_'_t even there !
0	it was definitely their fault - i mean i bought it from them .
0	they then went on and on .
0	my mother then explained again and again and still gave her the same answer .
0	they sounded awful and told me to bring it to a store .
0	just hearing her again gives me a headache !
0	awful customer service .
0	i '_ve just found out that i '_ve been paying £_00 a month and not getting my 0g - awful .
0	switch to t - mobile !
0	my sister '_s phone is t - mobile and it is amazing !
0	i would recommend anyone to try collect_plus more affordable way to deliver items and more efficient than royal_mail .
0	just received my refund order placed 0 / 0 / 00 order refunded 00 / 0 / 00 customer service team move the goal_posts on a daily_basis to accommodate there unacceptable service .
0	this company may be cheaper_than the high_street but more chance of wining the lottery that receiveing proper timely help when delivery you pay for is not received nor refunded .
0	£_00 . 00 is a lot to pay for delivery still_waiting after almost 0_months on an explanation as to why we are not being refunded for pallet delivery when our bathroom_suite arrived loose in the back of a transit with several items damaged and broken waiting almost 0_months for refund of damaged items but no refund for pallet delivery we did not receive .
0	trading_standards are aware of this company and investigating the laws they are breaking also looking into them charging customers surcharges for paying with paypal .
0	avoid as you have no guarantee of receiving your goods damage free and have no chance of resolving in a timely_manner be warned an extremely stressful experience that has put me off online shopping .
0	we would highly_recommend urban_sales , we found the price perfect and no compromising on online coverage or customer support .
0	a very straight_forward way of selling your home for a fraction of the cost .
0	we also opted for paul knight photography urban_sales photographer based in scotland who was outstanding both in the pictures he delivered and in the sharing of his wealth of knowledge in how we could help enhance our home .
0	our house sold quick and we had no ridiculously sales fee to pay .
0	thank_you urban_sales for a fantastic service .
0	:-)
0	i can '_t even describe_how pleased i was when my flowers arrived on thursday .
0	the colour_matches my bridesmaid_dresses perfectly and they are exactly_what i wanted .
0	there was no way i could have had such a perfect match with real flowers and so i would definitely recommend silk_blooms !
0	they handled my order perfectly from_start to finish with continuous communication and delivering on their promise !
0	i will definitely be using them again :-)
0	extremely happy with the quality of the product and even more so the speed of delivery !
0	so so happy !
0	can '_t wait for the big day to hand them out to people now
0	having really thick curly_hair the only straightener that '_s ever managed to tame my hair is the ghd_styler !
0	the only time i buy a straightener is when my current pair have got worn out , they always last over 0 years and so its always money well spent .
0	perfect every time !
0	as a recent graduate , transitioning into finding my ideal professional job has_been challenging to say the least .
0	having received my cv i would recommend the cv_store to all graduates from any discipline .
0	the cv_store has delivered friendly and constructive advice , top service , quick email responses , and even provided additional advice for interviews .
0	it is clear to see my cv has_been totally rewritten ; tailored specifically to my degree and consideration has also been given towards my specialist subjects .
0	i will be recommending the cv_store to everyone i know that is about to graduate this year , and i will be using your services again in the future .
0	thanks you again ,
0	kathleen
0	originally i found a gift on a rival site as they '_d given me a £ 0 voucher_towards something but .... ended_up being a fad !
0	it would pay for postage which i was eligible to get free but only allowed to put in one voucher_code !
0	decided to google shop and found internetgiftstore not only £_00 cheaper but free shipping !!
0	this saved me £_00 !
0	i '_ll definitely be shopping with these_guys again and the delivery was quick too !
0	!
0	thank_you so much !

0	when invited to an '_s ' themed_party , i wish i '_d of checked this site 0st before letting the other half decide we were going as starwars !
0	so many great ideas !
0	however we went_ahead with starwars and what a great night , our costumes were fab and they ' re all still in one piece .
0	normally when buying things cheaply ( had to budget ) they don_'_t last very long however i think these will do another few parties !
0	!
0	great value , looked great , fast delivery which let us know it was being posted , in transit , then at my door ..... could you ask for anything more ?
0	?
0	many ~ thanks
0	i love their quirky gadgets and needed a gift for both my nephews_birthday_presents .
0	seeing the site before i wanted to see what they had that was different , managed to get ian some cool bike spokes and ryan loves facebook so got him some " like " cufflinks !
0	all in the 0 for £_00 offer which was a lifesaver before payday :_d
0	picked_up on time at the airport in barcelona .
0	the woman couldn_'_t really communicate well with us , but she tried her best !
0	ended_up being a fancy car too !
0	she put the radio on and had us feeling comfortable for the 00 minute journey to our apartment !
0	brilliant !
0	return_journey , we were ready outside our apartment half an_hour early as i was worried .
0	the larger vehicle was there 00_minutes early , which was good !
0	and although we were meant to be picked_up at 0pm , we arrived at the airport by 0pm !
0	note to self .. you don_'_t need to get to the airport 0 hours early .
0	barcelona_airport is boring !
0	very good service and very good price with no stress or worry_about how and where to get the metro etc at only £_00 between four of us for a return .
0	will definitely use again in the future :) thanks !
0	anyone that is considering taking up the higher offer from bozowi should most definitely read all reviews first , i didn_'_t and it caused me more stressed than actually needed .
0	i sent my perfectly working iphone_0s 00gb in white , lock to o0 to bozowi .
0	first of all i was given a quote of £_000 .
0	all was well till i received an_email_stating “ the engineers have tested your phone and have found that your phone has a scratches on the unit and on camera lens and phone is network locked to o0 ”
0	there was no mention in the quote initially received about deducting money for the phone being locked , there is even the option to add who the phone is locked to .
0	i also knew there was a tiny_scratch on the camera but nothing considerable , i have taken many great photos without this affecting it .
0	i was furious with the second quote they had offered of £_000 .
0	the company then went on to say if i unlocked the phone ( at a cost ) they would up the quote by £_00 .
0	i was not happy .
0	the company is here to rip people off so they can make more money on the phone themselves .
0	they charge you £_00 to return your phone , which i ended_up paying .
0	i received my phone back on wed00th april .
0	i have since sent it to mazuma on thurs_00th apr and they have paid the £_000 quote straight_away and has cleared my bank today , fri_00th_april
0	avoid bozowi at all costs , otherwise it will cost you !!!
0	!
0	stick with mazuma_mobile , guaranteed happiness and helpful - ness everytime !
0	!
0	all girls had such a fantastic time , it was very organised and well planned .
0	was easy to arranged and make payments .
0	cocktail_making was just hilarious and the food was amazing !!

0	thanks for everything funktion xxx
0	flowers 0_days late - will they turn_up ?
0	doubt it now .
0	claim that their delivery policy is made clear on ordering - it isn_'_t !!
0	don_'_t use this company .
0	so disappointed for my friend .
0	customer service very friendly and high technology .
0	you can set to pay off your debt within one call , monthly_payments are suited to your posiblilities .
0	strongly_recommend .
0	glad they are here to help me .
0	very fast shipping and great packed course .
0	you have everything what you need for start and you can easily forward the instructions on dvd or manual book .
0	learning wasn_'_t easier until essential_nails step in :)
0	i had booked many hostels through hostels . com they recently updated their site and it '_s horrible .
0	they have a service charge that they say " if you sign up we will remove it ."
0	but it wasn_'_t getting removed , the site was taking forever , and i just cancelled all of my bookings with them .
0	i came_across this site and in less_than 0 minutes my hostel was booked with no problem !

0	cheapest for grohe products that i could find and price online includes vat and delivery so no_hidden_costs .
0	ordered on monday and delivered on tuesday - great service .
0	i would definitely recommend plumb warehouse .
0	i personally would nt use them again , on the website it states to allow up to 00 days for them to receive items but after that it takes up to another 0_days for the items to be processed in the warehouse then you receive an_email asking to verify your bank details and states payment can take up to another 0_days .
0	i sent my items 00 days ago and still_waiting for my payment to be processed .
0	it all seems quite a lengthy time process !!

0	i first used logodesignguarantee . co . uk in april_0000 for my partners window cleaning company and was pleased with the simple yet personal design i received , so when my mother in - law asked me about a logo for her business i was happy to recommend them and placed the order with all details of what she wanted and attached pictures .
0	i placed the order 00th_november_0000 but after a week i had not had any contact from them at all so sent them an_email , i did not receive any designs until 0_weeks_later ( even_though promised a response in 00 - 00_hrs ) which was via_email and not in my personal account , the designs were ok but no where close to what i had requested and i did not see that as a major_issue because of their " unlimited revisions request ".
0	i sent another email_detailing all revisions and over a week_later i got just 0 logo sample which was laughable , again none of the designs were in my account to view only via_email so once again i replied with my requests !!
0	!.
0	i was sent exactly the same logo sample again and that was the start of over 00 emails being exchanged with either the same design or the same responses :
0	" the support that you need shall be extended to you shortly "
0	" we have received the revisions that you want , and our designers are starting their work on your project "
0	" we apologize for the delay of the design samples .
0	our senior design expert is still working on the project so as to satisfy your concept of the logo "
0	" please provide more details and we will get back to you within 00 - 00_hours ".
0	i have even received my partners window cleaning logo as one of my samples !!
0	!.
0	i have tried to get a refund but that has_been ignored even_though they boast of a 000_% satisfaction_guarantee .
0	*** if you are cautious enough to do your homework first then i would avoid like the plague ***
0	if you paid with your debit or credit_card as a guest through paypal then the simplest solution is to contact your bank who might be able to refund you by issuing a card payment reversal under the consumer credit act , the transaction on your statement shows as " nochex " just keep any emails to them asking for a refund as proof .
0	if you paid via_paypal you have 00 days from purchase to file a dispute but don_'_t delay for " weeks ".
0	if , after a short time chasing , the reply is unsatisfactory or absent , make a claim .
0	i joined utility_warehouse in march last_year and have encountered nothing but problems .
0	the switch over was nothing but a headache with one problem after another .
0	recently i have had problems paying my bill due to taking 00 weeks off work to care for my mother who had terminal lung cancer and was given a max of 00 weeks to live & on top of that my partner was waiting for an operation on his wrist so was in plaster_cast and unable to work , i called to explain the situation on at_least 0 occasions and i was told my account would be protected , the payment was 0_weeks late but my services were disconnected despite_being advised they would nt be , i was left with no broadband & internet for over a week and told i would be charged to have them reconnected .
0	( our bills have always been paid up until then ) my recent bill was a lot more then expected so i called once again to explain that due to the circumstances it would be a little late , my bill was due on the 0st of december and i paid half of it asking for a week or so to settle the rest of the bill and 0_days_later all my services have been once again cut_off with out warning !
0	!.
0	all the way through i have been in contact with utility_warehouse and expected a little_bit of understanding and am shocked they would cut_off my service for a bill 0_days late even_though communication was made .
0	i called customer service to pay my bill and ask why after being told my services would be protected was i cut_off and the person i spoke to was rude , kept speaking over me and told me " you cant just call up and pay your bill whenever you feel like it and i should of given them a date when the bill would be settled but i was never asked to provide a date from the previous call .
0	the customer_services has mostly been terrible and i am quite upset i was spoken to like that for a bill that is only 0_days late !!
0	!.
0	dealing_with them now is just an extra worry i never expected to have and dread the thought of having to stay them !!
0	i would rather pay more money then go through all this hassle !!!!!

0	i recently_purchased a blinding moon shield rear_light .
0	i '_d previously seen it at edinburgh cycles for twice the price so was pleased to see it almost_half the cost inc . postage on highonbikes .
0	i was even more bowled_over by the fact that i ordered it on a monday_afternoon and had received it by lunchtime tuesday ... how is that possible ?
0	i don_'_t know .
0	but i was really pleased with the speedy service and great price .
0	would definitely use the site again .
0	i happened_upon this site through living_social by_accident and couldn_'_t have been happier with my purchase !
0	the site was so simple to use and there were some utterly beautiful bouquets available to choose from .
0	you can even choose your_own card design and personalise the message on the front as well as within to make it just that extra bit special !
0	delivery was super cheap and i '_ve every confidence that my bouquet will arrive in pristine_condition .
0	i know my mum will be utterly thrilled with them on mother '_s day , i can '_t wait to get the ' thank_you ' phone_call !
0	thank_you iflorist , i '_ll definitely be back !

0	speedy delivery of tickets and neat , easily readable website .
0	definately use this service again !
0	i chose to sell a pair of ghd_hair_straighteners for £_00 . 00 back in november and have still not received the money .
0	it may not seem a massive amount but to me as a skint student it is a lot .
0	chose to have my item collected by one a courier .
0	the courier did not come on the date i selected .
0	i emailed music_magpie informing them of this , and received an_automated_response telling_me i would receive a proper reply within 0_days .
0	i received this reply 0_days_later , and it stated that the matter would be looked in to .
0	that was the last i heard about that .
0	the courier had already arrived by this time , coming one day late , luckily he came during the one hour that day which i was at home , so i was able to give him my item .
0	ten days_later i received an_email from music_magpie stating that my item had not been received my them , and asking if i had decided not to sell .
0	i sent them a message the day after i received this email , using the online contact form on their website , in which stated that a courier had been to collect my item on 0rd_december and that i had a receipt from him proving this , and asking what i should do .
0	again , i received an_automated_response saying i would be replied to within 00_hours .
0	i never received a reply , so i sent another message using this form - again my message went ignored .
0	then , on 00th_december , i received another email from music_magpie saying ' we have not received your items , have you decided not to sell ?'
0	obviously this was very annoying as i had already sent two messages stating that my item had been collected by their courier some time ago .
0	these messages had obviously not even been read .
0	so , on the same day ( 00th_december ) i found an_email address for customer_services on the music_magpie website .
0	i sent an_email to this address explaining everything that had happened and expressing my disappointment in the lack of responses to my messages .
0	i received a response to this email 0_days_later on 0nd_january ( probably because i titled the message are you ever going to reply to my messages )... informing_me that my item had not been received by them and asking for some more details ( order number , number of items in the box , how many boxes it was packaged in and a tracking_reference ) so that they could make a claim from ' my hermes ,' the courier service they use , for the loss of my hair_straighteners .
0	i responses immediately with all this information .
0	i received no response to this .
0	on 00th_january , i sent yet another email , with the subject line as hello is anybody there ?
0	again explaining everything that had happened and asking whether or not i would be receiving my money .
0	again , i received no response .
0	on tuesday of last_week ( 00th_january ) my father telephoned music_magpie on my behalf to try and finally get some response .
0	he was told that i would receive an_email the next_day asking me to confirm my bank details so that the money could be transferred to me .
0	i did not receive this email .
0	he telephoned again on thursday 00th_january to ask again , and the man on the phone contacted his supervisor to obtain authority to transfer the money to my bank .
0	he was authorised to do this and said that the money would be transferred on friday 00th .
0	i still have not received an_email asking for my bank details , and the money has not been transferred .
0	i have emailed them again to ask whether they would like my bank details to transfer the money , but , not surprisingly , i have received no reply .
0	absolutely_shocking service and i will not be using them again .
0	would not recommend this company at all , i am so disappointed and have never felt so undervalued as a customer - absolute_joke .
0	three customer_services are liars , thieves , rood , don_'_t understand a word of english & give u an impression that your an_idiot to embarrass u so u can shut up .
0	they have been taking out money from my bank_account for the last 0_months after begging them to cancel my direct_debit because i had a new contract & didn_'_t want the old service , i also tolled them i didn_'_t need it because i had wi_-_fi , i was tolled that i cant use my ipad '_s wi_-_fi with out a sim_card & turned_out to be a lie .
0	not mentioning the very bad coverage
0	my partner and i booked a hotel in glasgow city_centre in october so we could attend the commonwealth games to which we have been allocated tickets .
0	we knew how busy and expensive it was going to get so thought we would be sensible and book immediately .
0	now , 0_months later , you have informed us that you will not be honouring our booking , effectively cancelling our booking , with only 0_months to go and as prices for accommodation increase daily .
0	our booking was confirmed .
0	we have called the hotel and they have told us they received our booking and you cancelled our reservation , so please stop blaming a ‘ technical_error ’.
0	you are punishing our foresight just so you can line your pockets with the substantially increased cost of a hotel room .
0	nothing in your terms and conditions allows for this situation .
0	your offer of a refund is unacceptable as we would then be unable to see the commonwealth games .
0	we will be out of pocket booking another hotel room which are now nearly triple the cost of our original booking .
0	the alternative_accommodation offers in edinburgh and ayr are a joke .
0	i have already planned 0_days in edinburgh as part of my holiday , and have no desire at this time to visit ayr - i have planned a holiday to glasgow .
0	we have booked our return flight out of glasgow ; do you expect us to drag our_luggage around with us all day on the day of our flight back to london ?
0	your offer of providing train_tickets is ridiculous .
0	the last train from glasgow to ayr leaves at 00pm ( 00 minute journey ).
0	the last train from glasgow to edinburgh leaves at 00 . 00pm ( 00 minute journey ).
0	how are we supposed to experience glaswegian nightlife if we have to catch a train back before 00 . 00pm ?
0	our night at the games doesn ’_t finish until 00pm ; it will be a real_pleasure rushing out of the stadium and back to the train_station .
0	we spend 0_days a week commuting on central_london underground trains , why do you think i want to go on holiday and spend nearly 0 hours commuting 00 miles ?
0	this is further to the fact that the alternate hotel in ayr is 0 . 0km from the train_station .
0	how exciting to arrive back in ayr at midnight to wait for a taxi !
0	i have a longstanding issue with a broken foot , which was one of the reasons we booked a centrally_located glasgow hotel , and you see fit to offer alternatives not within the same city ?
0	catching trains is not possible and frankly insulting .
0	how about offering another one of your customers enjoying a holiday in london alternative_accommodation in birmingham and see how they respond .
0	you need to arrange alternative_accommodation in glasgow city_centre .
0	looking online there is plenty of accommodation in glasgow city_centre .
0	if you cannot find us a hotel in glasgow , i expect you to refund not only the hotel booking you cannot ‘ honour ’(£ 000 ), but also the cost of other hotels we have already paid for during our holiday (£_000 ), our tickets to the commonwealth games (£_000 ) and the cost of our return flights to london (£_000 ).
0	your customer service has_been appalling .
0	how_dare you not reply to any of our calls and voicemails .
0	how_dare you delay your response to emails , and then expect a prompt reply to your ‘ offer of refund ’ within 00_hours .
0	i am not going to disappear because you continue to ignore me .
0	this is your responsibility - stop trying to pass the blame .
0	my first time book yesterday from hostel_bookers , it is good .
0	after_comparing hostels and hostels world , i found hostelbookers no more charge per order .. more , price is better ^^
0	liu from china :)
0	i have just attempted to book a flight with you from phuket to ho_chi minh on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
0	i was told that in the time from selecting the flight to confirming payment the product was no_longer available .
0	luckily for me however , you have still been able to charge me while providing me with nothing .
0	kindly , you have told be call you at my expense !
0	just wondering what you are planning to do about this as i have no_intention of ringing you to sort this out !
0	reading_reviews of others with the same experience , so hopefully you '_ll be experts at sorting this out promptly !?
0	looking_forward to your swift reply !
0	placed an order with sd on the easter_sunday , not expecting to receive the item until around thursday / friday the following week due to the bank_holiday_weekend .
0	received my order at tuesday lunch_time .
0	items were perfect , no_faults , no_problems .
0	husband claimed my free mug though ...
0	all in all , i would definitely order from again , especially if there is another sale on .
0	rude , clueless and down right insulting .
0	ordered a wedding dress from a seller here and when the dress arrived it was 0 sizes too small .
0	the seller then told me to got to a tailor to have it altered as it would be cheaper_than funding a return .
0	pointed_out to said seller that as she had not given any written notice before the sale that she didn_'_t fund returns , it was her obligation to do so .
0	i acted on her request however and consulted a tailor who said because the dress was that small , the whole look of the dress would have to be completely changed and rather_than paying for a dress , i would have just paid for expensive fabric .
0	i contacted asos and paypal , and paypal agreed that the seller had to do something about the dress .
0	but hold on , asos didn_'_t agree .
0	after getting very vague information over the matter from the seller , asos informed me that i was a liar and a thief and that i had been given a full_refund ( according to their system ) and had to return the dress .
0	( fyi , i was offered a partial_refund from seller to cover an extreme alteration , and never received a full_refund although the seller had used the asos sellers system to say that i had ).
0	0_weeks_later , after arguing my case and informing asos that i wanted to return the dress , i have been issued a full_refund and it was agreed that asos would send a courier to pick_up the dress .
0	as of today however , i have just been rudely_told by a ' senior_manager ' to keep the dress and put an end to the matter due to asos arranging couriers that cannot keep to agreed time frames to pick_up a collection .
0	it seems that asos don_'_t understand that losing a days work either loses myself or my employer money , and thus means i cannot stay in all day waiting for a failed attempt to collect the item .
0	i have used my statutory_rights throughout the whole_process and paypal , and legal services have confirmed that everything i have written and sent has_been correct and in line with the uk distance sellings regulations .
0	this didn_'_t stop asos from calling me a cheat , liar and a thief .
0	please , for your_own safety as a buyer , do not use the asos marketplace until you have fully researched who you are buying from .
0	asos still seem to allow sellers to sell items even_though the response by the customers reflects that the items they are receiving are incorrect and unable to be returned when they have been given no warning about this .
0	asos , it '_s disgusting that you can promote such incompetent idiots to ' senior ' positions who clearly have no understanding about buying and selling regulations within the uk and who refuse to protect their customers when all they have done is purchase in good faith and have used their legal rights when they have received unfit items . the whole episode has cost a lot of time , money and effort and with my wedding day approaching , has only made matters worse with me having to find an_alternative dress in a very short_space of time .
0	as a loyal_customer of nearly 0 years , i regret to say that i will shop with you no_longer .
0	i '_ve ordered several items from a well_known company for business advertisement .
0	and each one being delivered by city_link ( professional trespassing )
0	what the issue is with city_link is that their drivers are not educated in knocking on a persons front_door before leaving a delivery with them .
0	last month i ordered a box of 000 business_cards .
0	a couple of days_later i came into my kitchen at the back of the house after_hearing a noise and found my item sat on my kitchen windowsill in the rain .
0	the driver had unlocked my back gate and left my parcel .
0	they hadn_'_t even bothered to come to my front_door and i was sat in the front room at the time .
0	i contacted the company i had ordered from and city_link as my item has_been waterdamaged .
0	they informed me a replacement would be sent .
0	a few_days_later , the same thing happened again .
0	driver unlocked backgate and left item outside on windowsill .
0	i complained to city_link who didn_'_t answer any_questions on why their drivers were trespassing on property that was clearly locked up , and not even bothering to come to the front_door .
0	my item was replaced again , this time to be greeted with a driver with the attitude of a pubescent 00 year_old male .
0	he shoved my item in my face , told me to sign for it and he left .
0	a couple of weeks_later i had to order an_alternative item .
0	this time the trespassing driver had returned .
0	the driver banged her fists on my kitchen window , dumped the parcel next to the drain and was off , through the gate that she had unlocked again .
0	i had ran into the kitchen with fright due to the nature of her abrupt delivery , with a shaken 0 month_old in my arms and spotted her on my drive way .
0	so city_link , the next time i order and you have to deliver , if your driver ever trespasses on property that is clearly locked and is not to be accessed by the public , i will file a complaint with the police .
0	i have a front_door !!!!!!!!
0	!
0	we ordered an expensive item last_year and was told we would receive it within a couple of days .
0	we tracked , it never came , however yodel seemed to think that they had been to our house .
0	i worked from home for a week to receive my item .
0	they said we weren_'_t there and i begged to differ .
0	after numerous exasperating phone_calls i was told i could come and collect it at their nottingham branch .
0	so i went only to be confronted by the most ridiculously idiotic member of staff possible .
0	she denied that there was any note left for me to pick my item up and that even_though i had travelled 00_minutes to get my item ( that i had paid delivery for ) she wouldn_'_t give it to me ( as it was against policy ).
0	funny how that changed when one of their delivery drivers walked in on our heated discussion , and asked her why was it such a problem when all he had to do was walk out the back and get it .
0	i showed him proof of how long we had waited and the tracking_number and that was the end of the matter .
0	until the huge foot mark and dent in the box was spotted on nearly_£ 0000 worth of equipment .
0	since then i try to avoid anyone that uses_yodel as a courier service .
0	i '_m not sure_whether they are the cheapest option or not , but surely the revenue in having to give refunds due to their lack of courtesy and care , as well as navigation is costly enough to stop using these delinquents to deliver goods .
0	clowns .
0	quick and easy to post them off , very good price for the phones and the money came quicker_than i thought .... only 0_days from posting them
0	excellent
0	i have to say , our holiday was very dependent on a car .
0	we hired two astras and have to say they were awesome !
0	yes they have a few miles on the clock , but regardless , they were fantastic little run arounds ( and competed well with the bigger hire_cars )
0	einar also was awesome !
0	we had a problem with one of the cars , and with a flash he came to the rescue and delivered us a replacement .
0	a very friendly guy_who ran our hire seamlessly !
0	so on behalf of us all , thank_you einar and faircar for completing our holiday :)
0	product was dispatched on day of order and arrived promtly in perfect_condition .
0	super service !
0	quick delivery and high_quality products
0	they did exactly_what they said they would !
0	fantastic ordering process which allowed me to order flowers for 0 different_addresses , simply , fast and inexpensively .
0	i hurt my knee running , couldn_'_t get in at the doctors for two_weeks so decided to book in at ah instead .
0	they were really friendly , didn_'_t treat me like an_idiot who_knows nothing about fitness , and worked_wonders with my knee .
0	it was totally better by the end of the week and i was off running again .
0	excellent service and fast delivery .
0	only took about 0_days all in all to get the bag sent to me , my phone sent off and my money in my bank_account .
0	i would really recommend mazumamobile .
0	had a few complications finding my destination address at he time of booking .
0	however this was due to our villa being very new and address not being on most records , this was solved efficiently using a google_maps address and staff were very helpful and courteous .
0	our flight was delayed by an_hour , but a quick phone_call ensured our pick_up time was amended .
0	overall i was very happy with the service .
0	excellent service , wide_variety if goods , first and only drop for supplies
0	ordered a pair of chanel_sunglasses , price seemed to good to be true and was ....
0	one thing this company are extremely good at is taking money out of your account promptly , when it comes to delivering the goods that you have ordered or refunding money they are abysmal .
0	basically i ordered a pair of chanel_sunglasses at the beginning of the month , and began to get slightly_worried that i had received no confirmation of my order 0_days_later .
0	so i rang and asked for confirmation of my order in writing they stumbled and mumbled around " their systems " before telling_me that unfortunately they had sent my confirmation_email to the wrong_address .... after telling them how unprofessional this was especially if any of my payment details were in the email they eventually agreed to resend the email , unfortunately the lady in customer_services slammed the phone down before i had a chance to thank her .
0	the next_day and the confirmation_email had still not arrived , so i had to ring again .....
0	this time i did get speaking to someone_who handled my query extremely well who explained that the email had again been sent to the wrong email address ( by the way my email adrress is exactly the same as my name ) and promised that the email would be sent immediately .
0	the customer service rep then went to check how long it owuld be before the glasses were delivered , and after faffing_around for 0 minuted was unable to give me any more information that 0 - 00 working_days ....
0	after close to 00 working_days i began to get a bit_concerned as i had received no dispatch email so again rang the company to find out what was going on .
0	again when they eventually did find the order i was told that unfortunately the sunglasses were no_longer available as they had been_discontinued several_years_ago .....
0	when i asked how they were able to take my money for items that did not even exist they were not too forthcoming as usual .
0	so after declining to choose another pair of glasses i asked for a refund which i was told would be in my account in 0 - 0 working_days .
0	guess_what ?
0	0 working_days_later and still no sign of any refund however when i asked why 0_days ago was told that the accounts_department had forgotten to refund the money but it would be processed the same day ... silly me ....
0	by the way after finding out that the glasses had been_discontinued i found them with another company ( pret a voire ) who price matched the sunglasses_shop fictional price and had them on my doorstep by lunch_time the next_day , exceptional service especially by their rep called wu who actually stayed in work late to ensure my product was dispatched the same day .
0	after previously making a phone_call to order a thermostat to go with the underfloor_heating we had stupidly bought from focus , we decided this time to go with ' theunderfloorheatingstore ' knowing that the business has a friendly and effecient service !
0	excellent staff and very fast delivery !
0	so much_better with the new website !
0	very pleased , deffinately will be shopping again !
0	i found the whole_process of using protect your bubble quick & easy .
0	it gave_me all the information i needed to make my choice & to put the cherry on the top if was very reasonable which in this economy makes protect your bubble the right choice .
0	very happy with my cover & hope to use protect your bubble for travel_insurance next month too .
0	thanks
0	absolutely no_doubt that transferwise is the only choice for stuents doing a year abroad .
0	banks and other services are an_absolute rip_off in comparison - love it .
0	i ordered a north_face coat on sunday_afternoon , 0_weeks before christmas .
0	i fully expected it to take 0 - 00 days as is standard - and taking account of the time of year .
0	i couldn_'_t quite believe it when the coat arrived on tuesday_morning , less_than 00_hours after i ordered it !
0	i '_ve been telling_everyone how great e_- outdoors is , and will definitely buy off the site again .
0	thanks !
0	i recently went to cuba for 0_weeks and before i went , i phoned customer service and asked about any international usage packages so i wasn_'_t bankrupt when i came home .
0	i was told by gurtesh in the cairo call_center in these exact_words " as long as you use wifi , you will not be charged for using the internet ".
0	he went on the tell me quite patronizingly that wifi is through your handset and not your sim .
0	i checked into my hotel , bought wifi access cards to last my holiday and kept in contact with my partner and family back home .
0	i used facetime connected to wifi and facebook and i sent a handful of emails so i could keep in touch with my uni tutor .
0	i contacted vodafone customer service as i had sent a few texts whilst away as well and my bill was £_000 . 00 due to data usage .
0	i expressed a very explicit verbal dissatisfaction with this to the adviser at the fact that i had been lied to by a colleague and while i know i was wrong to swear , i think it is far worse that the adviser swore back at me .
0	i can be extremely hot headed at times especially when faced with a phone bill as big as my mortgage but i always apologise when i '_m in the wrong .
0	i got no apology from the adviser , just a supernanny style warning that if i did it again , she would hang up .
0	i '_d have preferred her to hang up instead of cursing me out if i '_m honest !
0	i '_ve posted this on the vodafone forum too and the response from the " expert " was to check that my data roaming was off and / or my cellular data .
0	i '_ve checked it and the only one that advises to be turned off when travelling is the data roaming as it specvifically states on the iphone that it incurs costs abroad .
0	the cellular data says it disconnects all wifi access and email etc which i still needed .
0	as far as i was concerned , the expensive bit was disconnected and that was of my own initiative , not even at the advice of vodafone .
0	to top it all off , they want to charge me so i can see the bill and i have been hung_up on by 0 advisers today when i ask to speak to a manager .
0	they all state there are no managers on the floor which is illegal as a manager has to be present at all times to deal with issues and complaints which is definately what i want to make but i am being refused at every turn .
0	i feel a bit_cheated that i '_ve had to resort to writing on a forum to express my comments but it seems the only way to get it seen by someone with a bit of power about the situation .
0	i have rated this one star because i have to , not because i wanted to .
0	the returns process is very poorly explained , they email in very abrupt short sentences and don_'_t seem to follow_up on assurances .
0	shoes are poor quality and every pair fits badly be it too small , too_big or too narrow .
0	i '_ve sent back every pair i '_ve bought .
0	shocking .
0	my partner had a mobile internet contract with them but since_moving in with me had no need for it .
0	he called at the end of june to give 00 days notice and was advised to call back after the 00th of july to give immediate notice and to ensure no more payments were taken .
0	he called back on the 00th of july ( today ) and was told that he had been misinformed and that the call he was making was his notice period and another charge would leave his account .
0	after 00_minutes to a premium_rate number , the advisor finally said that the earliest he would be able to cancel is the 00th of august anyway as this was the expiry_date .
0	my partner queried_why the charge could not be over looked due to loyalty and the fact he had been paying for a internet_connection he hadn_'_t used for about 0_months .
0	he was informed by the member of staff that loyalty only meant something to them when they were taking out new contracts to get better deals .
0	when my partner asked to speak to a manager or a supervisor , he was conveniently told they were in a meeting until close of the call_centre and a call back would be scheduled for between 00 and 00_hours .
0	when my partner advised that this would not be convenient due to his working hours , he was basically told tough_luck .
0	the advisor kept pressing the mute button while my partner was talking so about 00_minutes was spent repeating himself .
0	it was absolutely_disgusting how he was treated and to be told outright that loyalty only counts when you want to spend more money is beyond a joke .
0	took my phone over to their office in farmoor as couldn_'_t contact them by phone , was told i would get it back the next_day ... 0_days_later finally got my phone back and a yellow spot had appeared on my screen , it also warps if any pressure is put on the screen , tried to call them numerous_times , they didn_'_t answer their phone , have emailed them with no response ... pants repair and pants customer service ... won_'_t be using them again !
0	!
0	truly gutted to have wasted £_00 on this service and to have the issues i have experienced since !
0	!
0	you won_'_t get cheaper genuine perfume anywhere_else !
0	excellent value for money , free gifts included sometimes , good delivery time and good quality perfumes for a very low price .
0	very happy customer i will use fragrance_direct again they never_fail to deliver .
0	really pleased with the suite we purchased , exactly as describe , fantastic quality .
0	delivered faster_than_expected , good customer_services .
0	very happy customer :-)
0	very pleased with the service i received from mazuma_mobile .
0	fast payment , same amount as quoted , unlike_other_sites i have used in the past .
0	will only ever use mazuma now and have recommended to friends .
0	tried to buy a washer_dryer which would have been much_cheaper_than_anywhere_else i '_d seen it .
0	ordered it and was phoned the next_day to say that they didn_'_t have any even_though the site had said they had plenty in stock .
0	thought it seemed too good to be true .
0	was then phoned a week_later and told the same thing .
0	waste of time .
0	i very much recommend this company , the products are very reasonably_priced , packaged well , arrive quickly and the customer service is brilliant .
0	i needed advice on a product for my cat and they could not have been more helpful .
0	00 out of 00 viovet !
0	sent a few boxes of items in with a range of items in varying condition .
0	completely_understood that some of the books were very old , ( as most people , i had added them a little opportunistically in the hope they '_d be accepted ) but very concerned that some items which were brand_spanking new ( and conveniently worth more money ) were rejected as being damaged !!!
0	ziffit '_s terms and conditions state they cannot return the items - how very convenient !!
0	!
0	i had likewise sent a load of items to one of ziffit '_s main_competitors as they were offering more on some items and had no_problems_whatsoever .
0	i would suggest to others to physically take them to a trade - in place and accept or reject an offer on the spot in person so you can walk_away with your goods in your possession if they ' re unhappy with the condition rather_than being robbed blind as i have !!
0	!
0	was quite worried_about buying of this website as i didn_'_t know about the quality ect , after_reading all the good reviews i decided to buy one as i am a student in a house without a living_room !
0	i am writing this review sitting on my new bean_bag chair with a duvet .
0	say no more !
0	it was excellent speedy service and delivery .
0	the comfort and quality of the chair is amazing for the 00 . 00 with a free_footstool .
0	well_worth a buy , and i will be coming_back to beanbagbazaar for other items and also will be recommending it to family and friends !
0	:)
0	also had a text to change delivery or an option to deliver to neighbours , so its flexible to each customers needs !
0	go on you know you want too :))
0	great website , easy to use and booking exactly as hoped .
0	fair and fast service !
0	i ordered a pair of ghd '_s first thing yesterday and they arrived less_than 00_hours_later .
0	the price was the best price i found on the internet and the delivery / service was first_class .
0	i would reccommend beautycow . com to friend and family and i will be using them again .
0	thanks for much .
0	katy :-)
0	sadly , i would love to be one of the many customers whom are delighted in their reviews .
0	after purchasing a [_external_reference_] coupon , and deciding after looking at the products to use it as part payment , and opt for a larger_size frame , upgrading and paying the additional amount owed .
0	as stated by the company that i could do .
0	however , due to an issue during the payment process , the company have left the funds ' pending ' rather_than withdraw them fully .
0	paypal state that the order needs to be processed by the company . when i enquired_about the order status as i was eager to receive the canvas , the email i received back was offensive in tone , by being very condescending , and assumed the error was the fault of my inability to use a very simplistic ordering process .
0	they took the time to enclose an idiots step by step_guide , by not the time to actually track the order .
0	telling_me i had mistakenly_ordered the wrong_size !
0	if i had not experienced problems , i would say that the simplistic ordering is great , and the ease of use fantastic .
0	sadly , after many emails from my side , attaching proof of payment and order confirmations , i am still_awaiting any hint of whether i shall receive my canvas .
0	as emails are unanswered and assurance via the telephone unfulfilled .
0	very saddened and looking at the other products offered , upset as i would of ordered many more in the future .
0	it would seem that as long as the order is straight_forward then a good service , sadly , please be aware that if a problem is encountered you may be left hanging , or ignored .
0	after asking whether i should cancel the payment and re - order , no answers are forthcoming .
0	so i am left , confused , frustrated and deeply upset , as it appears to be only myself trying to come up with solutions .
0	i am very happy for those other customers that have received a good service , but also wish to just advise those that may in future have a problem .
0	i have 0_days to get my roll banner for a wedding fayre .
0	they checked it , emailed regularly and shipped to an address to get it there quicker .
0	great service .
0	have been really pleased with the easiness of using myhermes had no_complaints from the recipients .
0	great prices too .
0	i was so excited to find the lady tank engine in wood on this site at a reasonable_price as it has_been_discontinued everywhere_else .
0	the service and quality of the product is excellent !
0	my son is going to be so excited this christmas !
0	i found this hostel through another review site , but booking with hostelbookers was cheaper !
0	they also had better pictures available than the original review i looked at , and the map_feature is very nice .
0	there are so many great point to this dealership but the top one and the most_important is the person you deal with and for me & jason parr it is lee_baines
0	he is such a gentleman he will go out of his way to help you and provide the best service and meet all your needs .
0	if you have any_questions he does everything that he can to answer them .
0	we can not express enough how much this man has helped_us .
0	the quality of his professional ability to customers is 000_% we can not praise him enough for all his time and effort with getting us the right car and even threw in free mats which is a added_bonus .
0	if we have any_problems in the future we know that we can phone him up and he will sort it out .
0	he_loves what he does everyday and you can feel that when your talking with him he makes you feel at ease and always smiling we can not praise this dealership and the team members enough if your looking for a new car then this is the place to go .
0	if i have done it any justice in this review i hope you find that our experience has_been 000_%
0	would recommend 000_% to all friends & family to use this dealership best in the north_west by far !!
0	!
0	thanks again lee_baines your a super star
0	the tenor saxophone i ordered from gear0music arrived within 0_days , and was extremely well_packaged .
0	the saxophone itself plays well and is in very good condition for a used item ( including mouthpiece & ligature , which i was expecting to have to buy separately ), the case is in brilliant condition , and i was amazed to find also packaged in the case a new cleaning_cloth , neck strap and cork grease ( extra to what was mentioned in the description )!
0	the only_thing that really needs to be looked at is the cork around the neck , but i think i should be able to get that sorted_out fairly inexpensively .
0	as a summary , the service was excellent , and the saxophone is in much_better condition than i expected it to be for the price and considering the fact that it '_s used .
0	extremely pleased !!

0	sent 0 cards on the 0 / 00 / 00 and the 0 recipients of the cards only received them 0day ... thats 00 days for delivery , thats too long , especially with it was £ 0 . 00 for the delivery ..!
0	then i was told by both people that the invoice was attached to the front of the cards , stating the price i had payed .
0	how embarrassing ....!
0	both said the cards were nice ... i haven_'_t seen them ..!
0	i had sent a birthday card on the 00 / 00 / 00 to my uncle and he still_hasn_'_t received it yet and his_birthday is now , long over ... but hopefully it will arrive soon ..!
0	i '_m_sure with the invoice attached to it ..!
0	overall not a great service ...!
0	wont use again ..!
0	i '_m so greatful to this company and ' david ' that dealt_with my order .
0	i had ordered from another company and after waiting many weeks and no items , i had to re - order from another company .
0	i phoned and spoke to david at lester nurseryworld and he was so helpful and reassuring , so i ordered with them my stokke items .
0	i placed the order on a friday_afternoon and they posted it the same day and i received them monday_afternoon .
0	what a fast delivery service , and that was to northern_ireland , which always takes_longer_than mainland_uk .
0	will be recommending this company to friends & family and will order again myself from them .
0	great ink , great colour depth , last a reasonable lenght of time ...!
0	fast dilevery ..!
0	easy to use website
0	excellent products which have improved the quality of life for my dogs and cats .
0	i recommend yumega and yumove to all my friends .
0	lintbells customer service is outstanding and i will_continue to use their products for all of my pets .
0	great prices can '_t wait to buy more
0	the customer service is always second to non , now they have combined with t - mobile the signal in low signal areas has much improved and thats a great service to their customers
0	after_reading the reviews from back in jan i wasn_’_t sure to go with this company but i ’_m_glad i did as i am extremely happy with my roman_blinds , the samples i ordered came the next_day so that was great and they look really expensive and just what we wanted .
0	other_companies were coming_back with £_000 for 0 roman_blinds for our bedroom but these were £_000 which is an amazing price !
0	they came quickly and were easy to assemble !
0	i will definitely be using blinds 0 go again and will tell others to use this website too !
0	very happy i must_say !
0	:-)
0	i recently_purchased some wedding presents from this company at very short_notice .
0	i rang them up to see if the presents would arrive on time .
0	they went to a great deal of effect to make_sure this would happen .
0	they all turned_up on time and i am very greatful for this .
0	overall , good quality presents , arrived on time and good presentation of the packaging .
0	would definatley recommend this company .
0	thanks getting personal .
0	i was recently looking around to buy a bmw in the chesterfield store , i was brousing the cars outside for quite a while and not one member of staff came out to assist me , they were clearly too busy chatting inside .
0	i was quite appalded by this as they had obviously seen me .
0	i decided to leave and bought a car elsewhere .
0	poor quality goods , missing and damaged items .
0	extrememly poor after sales_team , poor organisation , very poor customer service and constanly being hung_up on .
0	it does not seem like an illegitimate company i dont_know how they havent been shut_down yet .
0	its been 0_months since my kitchen arrived and im missing half of it , and in all that time they have sent me one door !!
0	extremely disappointed !!
0	even by sending them this email will be a waist of time as i am guarenteed no response as once they recieve their money they could care less about their customer .
0	quick & easy didn_'_t have to leave the house , super service & kev was lovely , will definitely recommend and use again !!
0	!
0	i placed my order online and opted for the 0nd_class delivery option but my parcel arrived the next_day .
0	i '_ve found that items are very competitively_priced and i have no_complaints with the quality or service received .
0	i will definitely use them again .
0	i have been a user of lovefilm for 0 years_now , and rate them highly , they are good value for money and dont charge any late fees .
0	my only quibble would be that some of the new films that come out you cant rent as blockbusters has the right to have it before anyone_else .
0	would recommend this company to everyone though
0	i have used play . com on several_occasions , most of there products are good value , and they have free delivery which is great .
0	i will definetly continue to use them
0	i always use amazon for my dvds and music ( discs and downloads ).
0	you can compare_prices off different companies and also buy used goods .
0	you can buy many products from as little as 0p .
0	they deal with problems quickly .
0	i have used american soda loads of times_now and will always use them for my american goodies .
0	really good prices compared to all others on the internet , great variety of stock , great customer service , if you have any_problems they will deal with them quickly and efficiently .
0	i definetly recommend using american soda
0	i was stuck in a pickle - i made mess of weight and only realised after purchase ...
0	p0g was there for me as usual , with an amazing price , charlie fixed my error and it was only 00p more - despite_being a kilo and a half out !
0	and kept the same delivery slot , despite_being well after hours ...
0	i mean , seriously .
0	time and again , p0g have been just brilliant , whether delivering or collecting .
0	i can '_t honestly recommend them enough .
0	that '_s why i keep_coming_back .
0	and now they have a mobile_app !
0	i have purchased several groupons in the past ( never again ).
0	often what appears to be a good deal transpires to be the same price as standard or something cheap and substandard put_together for the sake of groupon , i feel this is the fault of groupon mis selling the products .
0	the customer service team are not very helpful , they fail to respond to emails and are impolite if you actually manage to speak to someone .
0	stay away from this company and hopefully they will disappear and no_longer rip us all off .
0	bonjour ,
0	a priori il_y a beaucoup_de mécontents , quelle que soit la nationalité des acheteurs ..
0	au vu des dernières reviews ( infurn . fr et infurn . com ) je_suis assez inquiète concernant notre première_commande_chez infurn ( au 000000 ) datant de tout début avril 0000 .
0	il s ' agit de 0 chaises victoria ghost ( starck ) et nous_avons évidemment trouvé que_le site d ' infurn était très_bien fait , hyper attractif avec_des_prix défiant toute concurrence .
0	nous ne nous_sommes même_pas méfié une seconde , l ' entreprise étant européenne avec_des filiales un_peu partout en uk , espagne , etc .. tout paraissait parfait , sauf le délai_de_livraison qui était d ' après nous un_peu exagéré mais bon , nous étions prêts à attendre pour obtenir ce_que_nous voulions .
0	0 .
0	livraison prévue la semaine du 00 août 0000 : nous_avons indiqué sur_le site ( dans notre_compte client ) une adresse de_livraison différente de_notre adresse habituelle car nous serions en congés .
0	0 .
0	lors_de_ma consultation de_notre_compte au début de_l ' été , je m ' aperçois que_le statut de_la_commande est toujours " en attente de fabrication " et que_la_livraison_est passée à_la semaine du 00 septembre .. première mauvaise surprise .
0	et_pas un seul message pour nous prévenir : c ' est à nous de le découvrir presque " par hasard ".
0	je rédige donc un message au service client en demandant pour quelle raison la_livraison_est différée de plus d ' un mois et pour dire_que vraiment , là , ça devient trop long .
0	réponse immédiate par tél + mail ( une dame a laissé un message sur mon répondeur en me disant qu_' elle m ' envoyait un email ) : les chaises n ' étaient pas conformes à leurs standards de_qualité donc ils les font refaire .
0	cette_fois la date de_livraison_est garantie mais si je veux annuler ma_commande je_n ' ai qu_' à le confirmer .
0	de plus ils s ' excusent , font un geste commercial en créditant notre_compte client ( pas notre_compte en banque , on est d ' accord ..) de 00_% du montant de_notre commande ( à utiliser comme bon nous semble sur_le site ).
0	je dis que ok , je veux bien attendre un mois de plus mais plus de blagues , cette_fois je_n ' accepterai pas d ' autre retard .
0	0 .
0	il_y a 0_jours en consultant le compte client , nouvelle " surprise ": la date de_livraison_est passée au 00 novembre pour_la même raison qu_' évoquée précédemment : défaut de_qualité , retour à_l ' envoyeur et refabrication .
0	cette_fois le compte client comporte un message expliquant tout_ceci , avec nouvelles excuses à_la clé .
0	je décide de leur écrire afin d ' annuler .
0	tant pis pour_le_prix intéressant , cela_fait 0 mois que_nous attendons des chaises pour compléter le salon , nos travaux sont finis et on arrête de rigoler .
0	je leur dis dans_le mail qu_' ils ont perdu notre confiance , que c ' est dommage mais que_nous désirons le remboursement immédiat .
0	habituellement la réponse du service client est immédiate , mais là , au bout de plus d ' une_semaine et 0 emails , aucune nouvelle .
0	uniquement des accusés de réception envoyés en automatique .
0	d ' où mon inquiétude .
0	je me suis donc renseignée , ai consulté différents forums et suis encore plus inquiète !
0	!
0	si tout_ceci devait s ' éterniser , nous_avons trouvé un moyen de_faire appel à différentes instances ( avec juristes , etc ..) pour régler ce litige ; apparemment de nombreux clients d ' infurn connaissent les même problèmes et_tout_ceci prends de_l ' ampleur .
0	il_n ' est_pas dans leur intérêt de jouer comme ça avec les nerfs et_l ' argent des clients qui leur font confiance , et_je_suis prête à comprendre que des délais_de fabrication peuvent être très allongés , qu_' ils ont beaucoup_de commandes ( et certainement de réclamations ) à traiter et qu_' ils sont débordés .
0	je_ne souhaite pas fusiller l ' enseigne et abonder dans tous_les forums avec_des commentaires négatifs et ne demande qu_' un règlement à_l ' amiable , comme avec toute enseigne sérieuse et respectueuse de ses clients et_de_la législation .
0	je m ' estimerai satisfaite quand notre demande d ' annulation sera bien prise en compte + quand nous serons remboursés de_la somme prélevée .
0	nous aurons perdu un_peu de temps mais pas plus .
0	je rendrai compte régulièrement de_l ' avancée de tout_ceci sur trustpilot et d ' autres forums / blogs .
0	en espérant que cette expérience sera utile et se terminera bien ...
0	00 / 00 : j ai_reçu un appel de jeremie de infurn .
0	il m a confirme que_le remboursement avait bien ete fait , ce_que_j avais constate moi meme ce matin completement par hasard en consultant notre_compte bancaire en_ligne .
0	la societe a donc bien recredite notre carte bancaire avant la fin du delai de 00 jours .
0	donc , pas tres bonne experience commefciale ( c est le moins qu on puisse dire ) mais societe honnete et_de bonne foi , mon experience me le prouve a present .
0	je_suis prete a commander a nouveau chez eux , mais cette_fois uniquement les_produits disponibles immediatement .
0	autant d attente et surtout de retard , ca n est_pas possible ...
0	how to say that ?
0	very good communication , fast delivery , perfect service .
0	i will undoubtedly order again from hollins and hollinshead .
0	thanks for all guys !
0	cheers ,
0	alexandra
0	compared to other_sites offering the same services , hostelbookers rates above the rest in my opinion .
0	the site is very easy to navigate and provides all the information to answer my questions .
0	the no booking_fee is an added_bonus !!
0	i definitely recommend this site to my friends !
0	very good service from_start to finish .
0	quick , easy , efficient and love the vintage_style of the waiting area , not forgetting the free tea and coffee and yummy biscuits !
0	i ordered one direction_tickets yesterday for my sister as a late birthday_present and they arrived today .
0	it was so easy to buy the tickets and had to problems whats so ever .
0	i was nervous_about buying them from website but now i will definitely be using this website again .
0	i recommend this website with high regards .
0	concert_tickets ordered from see tickets and dispatched via dx .
0	i was emailed the day before with confirmation of the delivery date and address .
0	this was all correct and the envelope arrived the next_day as promised .
0	sometimes you have to sign for tickets , however dx will deliver the envelope to the original delivery address without anyone_needing to be in , which for me was a bonus and much_easier .
0	very happy .
0	ordering process was very easy and the shower was delivered within two_days , using dpd who have a very good tracking / timing system so you know exactly when the delivery is going to arrive .
0	order was safely_packaged and arrived in good condition .
0	very happy with the service .
0	ordered online , item dispatched the same day and received two_days after that .
0	very happy with the service and would use again .
0	i found mattressonline very easy to use , i was able to select the specific day i wanted delivery for , and it turned_up as promised .
0	they state they normally deliver before 0pm which saves you waiting in all day , as it turned_out they delivered around 0 . 00am , at the same time as the bed was delivered ( from a different company !).
0	it was well_packaged and in good condition , and the freebie bounce back pillows are an excellent bonus as we needed some .
0	i would use them again in the future and recommend them to anyone .
0	tryed to buy jewelry set as a present only for the last two_days the link saying no deal found after paying , checking my bank_statement this morning to find they '_ve charcged me 00 . 00 twice !!
0	fumming , single hard working mum trying to shop about for presents and now £_00 down !!
0	emailed and no reply ,,
0	i have spoken to a very polite man after a response to this and now have claimed my gift and the other 00 . 00 has_been refunded , thank_you would still be a little_weary to use again unaided .
0	county hall is in the heart of london .
0	if you get the right room you can see the london eye and te trees lit_up in blue lights from you ' re room window , its delightfull .
0	the breakfast is everything you would want , i just don_'_t have a big enough stomach to try it all .
0	my favourite are the sausages and hash browns .
0	go and try it , you will_definatly have something to keep you occupied !
0	i was extremely happy with the quality and the expedited service that mazuma_mobile provides .
0	i highly_recommend them .
0	the whole_thing was dealt_with within the week .
0	fast payment_method really was fast !
0	i would strongly_recommend using special or recorded delivery .
0	call me paranoid , but i also used a brown envelope instead of the ' mazuma branded ' one provided , as i believe these are just an invite for people to pinch your handsets before they reach mazuma !
0	!
0	otherwise , excellent service which i have already_recommended to family .
0	all my transactions with this company have been first_class .
0	the products are excellent and reasonably_priced .
0	delivery is always quick .
0	zavvi has a huge_range of products at competitive_prices and the delivery is not only free but super_fast .
0	i was a little_hesitant to use viagogo at first , thinking some of the reviews were fairly negative .
0	on closer_inspection , all the complaints are regarding the prices .
0	in my opinion , if you use a ticket reseller , it '_s going to be more pricey .
0	deal with it .
0	i booked a very last_minute ticket a couple of days ago - for a gig the next_day .
0	for such a stellar gig and band , the price was only £_00 more than we paid for the face value tickets .
0	not bad at all - in fact , i '_ve made more of a profit selling unrequired tickets on ebay .
0	ticket was extremely easy to pick_up the next_day and was handily just round the corner from my work .
0	all in all , a brilliant experience and i would fully recommend viagogo to anyone .
0	those complaining_about the prices - pull your finger out and buy the tickets when they first come out .
0	the whole_process was so quick and simple - it took less_than 0_days from registering my old_phones to receive my money .
0	no_quibbles , no stress .
0	i '_ve already started recommending mazuma to all my friends !
0	easy way to make some money and get_rid of those old_phones in the house !
0	delivery on time and brill product !
0	great website to navigate , quick and easy booking_system .
0	no booking_fees which is what i like and they have a great selection of accommodation to select .
0	i have always found it reliable and safe to use .
0	last_year i booked a holiday for me and my disabled_mother .
0	asked to be near amminties .
0	but was put at the reat of the park but that was , nt the worst of it .
0	it backed onto a 00hr industraul estate .
0	when i triead to post a review 0 times on there own review site .
0	they would not publish it untill there customer service team have spoken to me .
0	im still_waiting .
0	but have noticed they only publish good reviews .
0	but not bad ones .
0	so i suggest to people not to trust there review site .
0	as its not honest .
0	if park holidays wish to contact me they can :- dp jonah .
0	hanwell .
0	london .

0	we are being forced to shop elseware by tesco being a partners with costa .
0	( costa a lot .)
0	we used to shop at tesco perival and then about five years_ago we stated to spend our £_000_+ a week shop went to there hayes middx store and guess_what that store has just becone a cost a lot cafe too .
0	so we are now lfft only with there osterly store and will contion to shop at that store .
0	but tesco be warned if you decicde to change ostley cafe .
0	to a costa a lot .
0	sainsburt here we come .
0	dpj000 .
0	i had to wait for weeks for masterplug surge proter to come into there hayes middx stores .
0	( the usual argos service .)
0	i reserved them to go on there on tueday .
0	only to waste my time and petrol as it was to come in at0000 that day .
0	so i went back on the friday of that week .
0	i went to pay with them with capital bonds and the manager refused them saying they was probley stolen .
0	i went home and rang capital bonds who told me no way should argos have refused them .
0	i then rang argos headoffice only to get lipservice appoilges and nothing else .
0	so if like me you should avoid argos like a shot .
0	they dont half the time have the item you want in stock .
0	shop at amazon e_bay etc .
0	which is what i will do in future .
0	they have a lot better customer_care .
0	dpj000 .
0	tesco is driving us to there rivals with there cafes .
0	we used to go to tesco perival then they bought in costa .
0	( costa a lot .)
0	tsince then we have been useing there hayes middx stores for years_now .
0	and guess_what there hayes store is now a cost you lots cafe .
0	so now we are limeted to there ostley store .
0	that is until cost a lot decieds to take there cafe over .
0	and then we will be taking our £_000_+ aweek shop to sainsbury .
0	so well_done tesco for shooting yourselfs in the foot .
0	and losing loyal_customers throucj your prtniship with c0sta .
0	dpj000 /
0	i use screwfix a lot . along with toolstation .
0	but with both companys .
0	if things go_wrong .
0	mainy when they ppost things to you0 they take no responyilty for there postal couriers .
0	which is dam wrong .
0	but .
0	my latest experience takes the biscuit .
0	i went to my local southall store .
0	00 / 00 / 00 .
0	to pick_up a item i had reserved on line .
0	yo queue up for agais yet again .
0	as they never have enogh staff there to serve .
0	they gave_me the item in a bag .
0	away i went .
0	only to open it later .
0	and find it was a used damaged item .
0	but !
0	i didnt think i had anything to worry_about .
0	i just rang customer service .
0	thinking they would send me another one .
0	by post .
0	___ wrong . ___ they wouldnt .
0	they justinsited i went back to store again .
0	well i dont_know about you !
0	but i havent the time to waste in taffic and queinf up again in there store which !
0	is always short_staffed .
0	for there error in selling me a second_hand item in the first place .
0	so i will be giving them a lot less business in future and recomed other people who use them to think elsewhere for there supplies .
0	and like a lot of reviews .
0	ive read .
0	they are getting exspenve i find toolstation .
0	cheaper in about 00_% of goods anyway .
0	dpj000 .
0	---
0	we use asda a bit .
0	the park royal cafe inside its store is crap .
0	several_times we havent eaten there because the food is overcooked and disgusting .
0	and when you ask them for something fresh .
0	they have , nt got it .
0	because they are too busy standing around gossiping .
0	cooking food in bulk and leving it around for ages .
0	three_times we have complained to its managers .
0	and to head_office .
0	although they make the right noises .
0	abuot there cafe staff nothings done .
0	i suggest asda pays there cafe staff a decent wage .
0	and sack there present park royal cafe staff .
0	and to any customer who . s thinking of eating there .
0	_____ dont . _______ unless you want food poising .
0	not to bad .
0	nearly always gets me to right sites .
0	i like the ease of use .
0	very good .
0	very prompt .
0	on sending my product .
0	we left booking our holiday until 0_days before travelling , with a busy work schedule it seemed we would need to use an agent for the first time ever .
0	i was anxious to start with as have always travelled independently , booking directly with the hotel .
0	what can i say but how absolutely_brilliant linda was throughout the whole_process , finding us what we really were looking for .
0	we couldn_'_t have organised it without her .
0	if the holiday is as fantastic as the service so far we will definitely be booking through linda , and holiday please again .
0	thankyou .
0	really great , easy way of getting a take out in a larger town , and im_sure as the site develops more and more businesses will eventually post their menus etc .
0	living in a smaller town on a weekend however proves to be a bit of a nightmare .
0	none of the local take outs have joined up or even submitted their menu , but this is hardly just eats fault .
0	ok service , would recommend .
0	i have been loyal to o0 since owning a mobile phone .
0	i love the service they provide and the signal is fantastic for where i live ( in the sticks ) however , the crazy expensive contracts are beginning to wind me up and the repair service is incredibly_frustrating .
0	they couldn_'_t understand the original fault with my phone so instead replaced the circuit board which hasn_'_t helped the problem at all .
0	next time , i think i will send it to htc directly as they seemed to understand the problem a lot better when i explained it to them .
0	apart_from that , o0 are still a good company , but they need to be more competitive in terms of pricing and benefits if they want to keep_up with their_competitors .
0	buying a domain is an_absolute_bargain .
0	however the hosting options seem a little expensive in comparison to their_competitors .
0	switching hosts proved to be a little frustrating and the agent i was contacting proved to be less_than helpful .
0	would recommend for cheap domains , but for the rest of the service , including buying email accounts , head somewhere_else for a much more affordable service .
0	the aol website is quick and easy to use , but as an internet provider , i just cannot recommend them .
0	i used aol before switching to bt , which i still remain on til this day .
0	the customer service and internet_connection was collectively terrible .
0	not a month went by without a fault or problem , incredibly_frustrating .
0	the customer service was mediocre .
0	occasionally they would manage to reset the line ?
0	and it would magically turn back on .
0	other times this didn_'_t work and we had to wait it out to retrieve connection again .
0	bit of a nightmare .
0	since the wildfire was brought out , i have never considered using any other phone manufacturer .
0	the design of the handset reassures you that you have a durable and high_quality phone .
0	the android operating_system is perfect .
0	i have played around on a lot of i phones and other smart phones , but htc make other models my different manufacturers just seem like a child '_s toy .
0	would recommend if you want a powerful and sleek looking phone without the designer price_tag ( apple ).
0	when it comes to the delivery of any parcels i purchase or sell online , it has to be city_link delivering .
0	not only can you feel rest_assured that they will actually turn_up when they say they will ( unlike the vast_majority of other courier companies ) but the service is always fast , efficient and friendly .
0	can '_t fault them , perfect .
0	i purchased everything i needed to build my pc from this shop .
0	it all arrived_safely and in good condition .
0	wouldn_'_t_hesitate in using again , as they are incredibly fast and efficient
0	richer_sounds by far had the cheapest model of tv that i wanted .
0	i called ahead to reserve it , no problem .
0	they offered to extend the reservation just in case i couldn_'_t make it .
0	in the store itself all of the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly , quick service and carried it to my car for me too .
0	really couldn_'_t ask for more .
0	would not_hesitate recommending or using again , truly excellent service .
0	easy as always .
0	the only_thing i would say is i '_d like to see my tickets in my basket in chronological order ...
0	i added them back to front and then got confused !
0	!
0	i ordered a product and specified a separate delivery address ( my work ) to my billing_address ( my family home ).
0	it arrived very quickly but i only found out when my mum called me to say that i had post .
0	i avoid deliveries to my flat as it '_s not very secure but it '_s inconvenient to have to travel to my mum '_s house to pick_up some makeup !
0	!
0	in addition , i stopped being_able to make card payments temporarily and when i called up my bank , they said that there was a discrepancy and possible fraud on my account which when we looked closer was caused by the fragrance_direct transaction which failed to pass full security because the addresses didn_'_t match .
0	i can understand this extra layer of security when its an expensive product like electronics but it '_s a very low ticket item .
0	that said delivery was very fast and the price of goods and shipping very reasonable and i would still use fragrance_direct if i could be sure these problems didn_'_t happen again .
0	i have ordered several_times from chemist_direct and always been pleased with the efficient service and straightforward website .
0	i always get contacted with relevant deals which i '_m happy to receive thanks guys keep_up the good work !
0	ordered on 00th_march .
0	now 0th_april and still_waiting .
0	no communication at all from them .
0	can find no fault with them .
0	constant_emails to update on status .. watch arrived when they said it would .
0	follow_up emails to make_sure all was okay .
0	would strongly_recommend them .
0	why pay more ?
0	john_lewis could not give better service !
0	well working , easy to install ram , delivered quickly and efficiently .
0	i '_m waiting on the delivery of a new mobile phone ( not an i - phone ) that was arranged to be delivered yesterday , but no - one was in to sign for it so i got a sorry we missed you card which is fair_enough .
0	but i '_ve taken today off work to make_sure i was in for my delivery , but instead i '_ve got an e_- mail telling_me that dpd attempted to deliver my parcel and no - one was in .
0	well i am in , and have been in all morning .
0	no calling_card was left , so they clearly just didn_'_t attempt to deliver it .
0	there seems to be no way you can call the company and speak to anyone in person either .
0	not impressed
0	the package has_been dispatched two months_ago , until now i '_ve never received a word from it .
0	everytime i send an_email to contact the service center , there '_s only an automatical mail response .
0	i really suspect if there '_s a real employee working on this part !
0	well , finally i receive my package in a week aftre filling in the replacement form .
0	i will strongly_suggest to choose the delivery with charge if u really want to buy sth here .
0	they try and if they get it wrong they put it right , what more could you ask for ?
0	this company is usually 00_% brilliant and if something wrong ever happens they sort it .
0	ordered tubes which arrived in flimsy box and both had been snapped , charterhoue resent and luckily new tubes arrived ok but still send in cardboard_box , would think that these could be easily squished
0	have used warehouse aquatics for several_years_now and theyv always been brilliant - staff are really helpful and im always infomred about my delivery
0	best price , regular_updates , very speedy delivery and i '_m_sure lots of happy customers , myself included .
0	thank_you .
0	we ordered a sofa from argos and was informed it would be delivered on the 0th of december_0000 after waiting in all day and with no contact from argos themselves we eventually rang there 0000 higher call charge customer service centre .
0	this is when the trouble began ...... we were informed the sofa was not even in stock and should not expect delivery until the end of january , unfortunately due to expecting delivery of our new sofa on the 0th of dec we had parted with out current sofa to make room .
0	due to this we were informed we could choose another sofa which could be delivered in time for christmas with £_00 compensation added on due to their mistake great !!!!
0	so on the 00th of december we again waited for the arrival of our sofa as promised and guess_what ????
0	no phone_calls and no sofa .... after_contacting argos '_s dreadful customer service centre we were again informed the sofa we had been promised delivery of for the second time was also not in stock .
0	it seems argos are happy to sell items they do not have in stock and give customers completely made up delivery dates just to make a sale .
0	they have no regards for customer_satisfaction and are unreliable and unhelpful in every way .
0	i would not recommend using argos for any item which requires delivery unless you like surprises and are willing to wait and see when your item will finally arrive .
0	as above i did but no response from them .
0	customer service is worst than the hell .
0	i don_'_t find anything to write beside my anger .
0	i saw it when i first registered at this site , i was having a problem with entering my address and before i knew it i had help option to ask if they could help - i was then assisted with the greatest professionalism and was able to register and make my first deposit , no problem .
0	again i visited winner today and found that the site was a refreshing_change to others that i had previously visited .
0	the navigation was tremendous as was the nice welcome_bonus that i received - always helps .
0	i think the design is top_notch and is looking_forward to my next visit .
0	most of these casino sites are all the same but this one offered something different which i enjoyed and would push others to as well , winner . com is one of the pioneers to give players some variations each time .
0	wonderful customer service and nice payouts .
0	very fast withdrawals .
0	plenty of games to satisfy everyone and nice graphics , really user_friendly !
0	well_done .
0	the promotions are really worth their while the site is very user_friendly and easy to understand for first time online gamers .
0	bingo_cams is the best site i '_ve ever been on and i ve been on load . they offer load of bonus and i '_ve made some good friend on this site the chat host make the site with the excitement and funny this they do to make us laugh and the thing bingo players make them do just love this site well_done bingo_cams
0	any orders placed during the time advertised will not come on time
0	avoid at all costs as this company can not get an order wrong go over customers heads and change orders and the options you are on dont ever go with bt
0	slow connection try to cancel aren_'_t able to i have spent days trying to get them to terminate my account still trying with no success
0	never go to three avoid at all costs customer service is appealing cant cancel or change your service plan for the whole 00 month_contract have been a 00 customer for years would recommend o0 over three wish i never went to them as theyndont have the first idea on how to deal with complaints leave you hanging on the phone for hours on end in the end i have given up trying to reason with them info hope that when my contact comes up for renewal i will be able to cancel .
0	i haven_'_t yet used cd to the full , in fact only once , but they have explained_everything really well also made it so i could use them easier for my abilities , very understanding and officiant , leaving me satisfied to use them with confidence on the many transactions in the future .
0	loved the shop on high_street and my lunchtime favourite !!
0	will be missed
0	my first review had to get my heart out !!!
0	paid for 0 mb getting hardly 0mb .
0	cannot even watch iplayer !!!
0	avoid like plague asking for my money back
0	ordered couple of dresses and couple of pair of shoes .
0	just arrived this morning .
0	i must_say what an amazing find .
0	well_packaged and just £ 0 . 00 for each what a bargain .
0	postage was £ 0 . 00 for 0 items which i would say is reasonable .
0	happy and love it love it love it !!!
0	recommend to every one .
0	last_minute booking but easy to deal with and communicate .
0	would highly_recommend .
0	thank_you neil !
0	great website that allows you to see what others think of the hostels - and what they are really like !!
0	also great to quickly see whereabouts the hostels are located and if they are right for me and the trip i '_m taking .
0	simple quick and easy booking process as well !
0	!
0	brilliant products and services , my baby and i both using their products , highly_recommended !
0	easy to use website , clear_instructions , found my phone quickly .
0	i returned my phone by printing my own_labels and payment was received promptly .
0	it couldnt have been easier .
0	great service pleased with payment , no_hassle , easy to deal with and quick payment
0	was given help from daniel with a problem i had with a booking .
0	very fast and friendly .
0	if only all customer_services could be this helpful !
0	many_thanks .
0	this ' company ' is shambolic .
0	they took my money , didn_'_t email or contact me in any manner to confirm my booking and didn_'_t deliver the product i '_d ordered either .
0	thank god i paid with paypal otherwise i '_d probably never have got my money back .
0	they do not answer the phones or emails .
0	this company has_been reported to trading_standards and with any luck they '_ll be forced to cease trading .
0	never ever go_anywhere_near them .
0	i got ripped_off twice by previous companies ' selling ' the same product .
0	the first one couldn_'_t provide the product i '_d paid for and the second one failed to respond to my order at all resulting in me having to contact trading_standards .
0	0rd time lucky in my case .
0	wantthelook . com provided exactly_what i '_d asked and paid for with no_hassle .
0	very reasonable_prices and free delivery .
0	i have no_issues with this company at all and would like to thank them for finally putting right what other_companies had previously mucked_up .
0	thank_you !
0	!
0	i made a spontaneous purchase after_seeing an advert on the tv for the watch shop .
0	i '_ve seen people wearing a particular watch that has always caught my eye but i never knew what it was .
0	i hopped online , went straight to the sale_section and there it was , the watch i '_d liked so much and it was on offer at 00_%_off too - bargain !
0	very easy to pay ( i used paypal , it takes seconds ) and then i was quite surprised that they were offering free next_day delivery .
0	true to their_word , the watch arrived shortly before 0000hrs on saturday .
0	very well_packaged and even_nicer_than it looked online .
0	all in all , very pleased with the online shopping_experience with watchshop . com .
0	i '_ve_used boots online many_times_now but my most_recent_purchase was a new electric_toothbrush .
0	i treated_myself to the most expensive philips sonicare brush that they offered which then turned_out to be half price with an extra 00_%_off too !
0	a £_000 toothbrush ordered and delivered all for £_000 .
0	what an amazing saving .
0	it was delivered on time as promised and not a single thing to complain_about .
0	very pleased and will_continue to use boots both online and in store .
0	i came_across this website quite by_accident .
0	i '_d spent weeks looking online for outdoor clothes suppliers and i was looking for a particular_brand .
0	the company was cheaper_than previous companies offering the same product and they had a wide_choice of warm / wet_weather clothing .
0	at point of checkout i was offered a variety of delivery options but next_day anytime was being offered at the same price as other options .
0	not quite believing they '_d live up to the promise , i opted for next_day anyway ( why not ?!)
0	and true to their_word my items were delivered less_than 00_hours after i '_d placed my order .
0	communication was good , i was kept_informed at every_stage of the order and it was also fully_trackable .
0	as a customer , what more could you want .
0	as a more than experienced online shopper , there is only one other company that i '_ve ever been as impressed with as outdoor_kit .
0	well_done .
0	i am very pleased with my first purchase from complete_aquatics .
0	i had searched several websites for the items i wanted and all of them were cheaper by at_least £ 0 from complete_aquatics than competitive businesses , including the one that i originally bought my aquarium from .
0	also , my order was placed at 0000am on a friday_morning and it had arrived , in full by 0000pm the next_day .
0	i received good communication from the company , you can '_t get better_than that .
0	first time using this company , and it was an_absolute_pleasure !
0	i bought bracelets , they arrived a little over 00hrs_later !!
0	they ' re gorgeous , exactly as_described all packed_securely , what more could you want !
0	?
0	i will_definately use again and recommend to friends .
0	fast delivery , high_quality foods , very tasty !
0	the order arrived very quickly ; have used them several_times as they ' re nearly always the cheapest around !
0	this place is buy far the best , yes the shipping may be high but if you add in all the free_samples you get to try out its totally worth it what i would spend on another site for the same products with free shipping would be way more .
0	i got 0 things for the price it cost for one on another site .
0	i popped in for card toppers and found what i needed easily ( and ended_up buying more !)
0	the guy on the tills was friendly and enthusiastic .
0	i also attend a knitting group and crochet group in store and we are welcomed and made to feel special
0	the process overall only took four days , that included me requesting a pack to send my mobile to mazuma in the post , mazuma recieving my mobile , and then me recieving my chosen payment option in the post .
0	i think the service is fantastic , fast and reliable and i would definately_reccomend it .
0	i could easily keep track of my order on the website so i wasn_'_t in the dark about the process and from the emails i recieved and information on the website , it explained_everything i needed to know so the process was easy , stress_free and fast .
0	thanks mazuma !
0	i can '_t_believe_how quick and easy the process was .
0	thought there must be a catch ... there wasn_'_t
0	i ordered a few things for my friends birthday a week before her_birthday , and checked the delivery box which was 0st_class royal_mail , which said it should be delivered within 0 - 0_days , i thought that gave_me plenty of time honestly , now , exactly 0_days after i '_ve placed my order , the delivery still_hasn_'_t come , my friends birthday has passed and basically the customer service team couldn_'_t have been less helpful , a lot of " if it hasn_'_t arrived by such an such a date then we can declare it as lost ", that '_s not really good enough is it , especially when i paid_extra for it to arrive earlier !
0	waste of time .
0	i popped in with my children and was happy at how welcome we were all made to feel .
0	very friendly , knowledgeable_staff and a fantastic range of ladies and kids wear alongside the pro kit .
0	something for everyone !
0	!
0	many_thanks
0	i have used mazuma_mobile twice_now to sell 0 old_phones and i have found their website useful - they send confirmation emails that eased your mind , and kept you updated with the process .
0	it '_s good to know that my old_phones are going to use elsewhere , and the amount i have been paid has_been good .
0	this is definitely a service i trust and will_continue to use in future .
0	i have recommended this to my boyfriend and friends too , who have all benefitted from this service .
0	i had a rubbish old bike that i '_d bought for £_00 and was using it to get to work when a colleague said we used cyclescheme .
0	i jumped at it - a new bike , tax free , that comes directly out of my wage .
0	what '_s not to love ?
0	head out to a cyclescheme bike shop near you , which can be found on their site , and get a quote .
0	give it back to your employer who will work their magic and you '_ll get a confirmation_email with a code that allows you to collect your bike .
0	i '_ve got fit , improved my mood , improved my productivity at work and use my bike to collect shopping etc ( i don_'_t drive ) so it '_s been an_absolute life_saver .
0	you can also add in clothing , lights and safety equipment if you need it ( but i already had my own from my old bike ).
0	there '_s no reason not to do it .
0	my other half recently passed his ppl and this was a surprise gift .
0	the wings arrived promptly in a padded_envelope and came in a lovely decorative box .
0	he was really happy with them .
0	what could go_wrong with this .
0	fantastic company , kudos to moneysavingexpert .
0	i always use this when looking for anything !
0	we ' re with bt at the moment , have been for around 0 years .
0	since then we '_ve had numerous charges that shouldn_'_t have been on there .
0	called up a couple of time to have to wait 00minutes for somebody in india to pick_up .
0	they then say they '_ll write a note on the system and the charge will be reversed ( which doesn_'_t actually appear to happen ).
0	also upgraded with them to infinity , to then get a bill for over_£_000 for leaving the previous contract early and £_00 for the existing hub which i refused to pay .
0	remember to write down the vol id number when dealing_with them , as they are sloppy in keeping their promises .
0	i almost always purchase my electrical items from john_lewis .
0	the shops are always a pleasure to walk around , the staff are helpful , and they also offer an attractive warranty on the products .
0	previously i had an item that went wrong for some reason , and john_lewis replaced it straight_away without_any_issues .
0	fantastic company , i have a lot of respect for the business and always recommend people to buy there .
0	i used to use ebay all the time , but it appears nowadays the majority of auctions are set by companies and ebay businesses .
0	there '_s nothing wrong with this , but it '_s not the same as it used to be where people are selling their used belongings for much less_than it would cost in the shops .
0	we '_ve been looking for a tablet for a while now , and jexaa helped_us choose a tablet that suited the needs of myself and my wife .
0	not once did they push us into the sale , but were honest and open about the uses for each tablet which we found rare to come by .
0	the order was placed , and we received the tablet 0_days_later .
0	the ' jextab ' works great ; has some nice features too , and cost a fraction of the other tablets out there which put a smile on my face :)
0	good work jexaa .
0	i was searching for a company who did great standard canvas_prints at reasonable_prices and came_across orbit_print ltd .
0	i have never ordered canvas_prints before , and wanted to get some of my personal prints done but didnt know where to go and who to trust with my pictures .
0	i was so pleased when i received my order as the quality was perfect and the prices even better .
0	i am a very happy customer - thank_you !
0	i was very impressed with the prices and range of product .
0	i also liked that there was a free delivery option on orders over_£_00 , which i thought was very reasonable .
0	i '_m a 00 year_old writing on my mums phone and all i can say is that it was amazing .
0	they helped_me too choose my converse which i have now fell in love with , and then took a picture and posted it on facebook !
0	it said ' evie looking cool in her new mint converse !
0	', which made me feel special and at home .
0	when i saw the facebook post it made me smile and feel welcomed .
0	the way they make you feel like you are the princess , by reccomend beautiful tootoos and
0	good communication , great delivery , no_complaints :)
0	could improve range of products .
0	website doesn_'_t look very professional .
0	i recently_purchased the knomo avignon extra slim brief 00 ″, black , from right bag .
0	i had been looking for this particular laptop case for a while and found that right bag had this not only in stock , but at a lower price to all of the other stores i had looked at .
0	the site was really user_friendly and easy navigate_around , with good images of the product too .
0	i wanted a slim case and felt i got a good perspective of this from the images on the product page .
0	i opted for the free delivery option ( which i was also pleased they offered ) and this arrived promptly ( 0_days_later by royal_mail ) with good protective_packaging .
0	i have been made up with the case and would definitely recommend right bag to others .
0	i '_ve never dealt_with such incompetence in my life !
0	first , an order i made with a 00_%_discount_code was to be delivered by december 00th , which is great because i wanted it for christmas .
0	oh !
0	what '_s that you say ?
0	your tracking_info won_'_t update and you can '_t locate your order ?
0	oh - how convenient .
0	so i contact customer service .
0	they inform_me that there '_s a technical_issue with their tracking_system and assure me the order will be here by the 00th - the latest .
0	oh !
0	going on the 00th .
0	so needless to say , i didn_'_t get this by christmas .
0	but it gets better ...
0	i figure , maybe i '_ll get it on the 00th , you know - because of the holidays , and they have a few more nice items i like , let_me get those .
0	i '_ve dropped $_000 after this point .
0	i select express shipping !
0	i '_ll have something nice in time for new years_eve because it will be here by friday the latest .
0	wonderful !
0	i checkout and go on about my business .
0	i noticed , however , that i didn_'_t get the dispatch email , so i check out my account on the 00th .
0	standard shipping ?
0	oh , ok . we ' re about this life .
0	i contact customer service , thinking it '_s a website glitch and maybe they can fix it within the 0 hour time frame posted on their site .
0	0 hours_later i get an_email_saying , i didn_'_t choose express shipping even_though i entered in the promo_code .
0	so in turn my order won_'_t be here for a max 0 business days .
0	oh , really ?
0	you think so ?
0	this in turn prompted my urbanista to come out full force , because there '_s nothing that pisses me off more than someone not taking accountability and then saying it '_s my fault .
0	i go on a email rampage .
0	i dig into this guy .
0	at this point , i now know i '_m not getting my stuff so i just go h . a . m .
0	it is what it is , so lets do this .
0	0 hours_later i get another response telling_me that i didn_'_t receive express shipping not because i supposedly forgot to choose it at checkout , but because i used a 00_%_discount_code and i can '_t double codes up .
0	what ?
0	you mean the 00_% i used with my previous order ?
0	now you guys are just being ig - nant .
0	so again , i have to correct these people - stop pointing the finger , get your facts straight , and find my stuff .
0	now i take it to facebook .
0	i unleash my discontent on their wall and receive the generic " pm me so i can help you " response .
0	ok , cool .
0	lets play this game - i love games .
0	i go through the motions again , explaining all the bullshit that '_s been happening .
0	while i '_m doing this i get yet another email via asos .
0	this time they tell me there is a technical_issue with my form of payment ( paypal ) which is why it did not take my request .
0	but don_'_t worry they ' re working on it and here '_s 00_% and another express shipping coupon_code .
0	oh !
0	the coupon_code that won_'_t work , ergo our issue at hand ?
0	brilliant !
0	keep it up !
0	i love it !
0	how does that help me ?
0	back to facebook .
0	someone slips up and tells_me who the courier service is .
0	oh !
0	let_me contact them .
0	i have to call back because the one person that handles asos is out of the office .
0	how convenient .
0	so , kids .
0	$_000 later i have nothing .
0	no packages , no dresses , nothing for nye , nothing for christmas ... zero !
0	now that i '_m out of options - annoying these people is my current goal ( lack of funds being my motivation ) and will_continue to annoy them until someone gives me my merchandise or my money .
0	and frankly all i want right now is my money !
0	iv been a customer for 0 years with baby lurve when they started off on ebay and the service and care they give is second to non .
0	all items are packed and sent with lurve and care .
0	if your looking for a company that posts next_day and has free delivery then baby lurve is for you :) x
0	go on fall in lurve !
0	i have purchased from precious_little_ones twice_now and have been very happy with my pink_lining products would highly_recommend them to anyone .
0	keep_up with the lovely work precious_little_ones x
0	having been greeted_by the words " mum , you know you love me ", the words every parent dreads hearing because they know something is going to cost a small_fortune , i turned to my teenage_son with trepidation .
0	" if i give you the money back , can you get me xbox_live ?"
0	bam !!!
0	there it is , the request for spending £_00 straight out .
0	ouch !
0	but after a little internet_search i came_across this fab website cdkeys . com , that saved me money ( instant parent happiness ) was an_immediate digital delivery ( instant teenage happiness ) and is probably one of the easiest websites to use ( instant brain happiness ) plus i get cool mum points for saying yes !
0	:) thanks for making our weekend - the ( happy ) vance family
0	i was a little optimistic about ordering off the site because the prices were so cheap , i thought it was maybe some kind of scam site or the perfumes were fake , but i was totally wrong !
0	the service was excellent , had no problem ordering my perfume and it arrived within a few_days .
0	when my item came it was sealed and in perfect_condition .
0	it was also parfum and not toilette i got my perfume for around £_00 for 000ml when another shop on the high_street which i wont name was charging £_00 for 00ml !
0	excellent value , excellent service , excellent delivery and its hard to say that about a company now a days !
0	thank_you !
0	i traveled all over europe for a few_months and my favorite accomodation was de lis guesthouse by far .
0	it '_s housed in the second floor of an apartment building and has the feel of renting an apartment with all of its amenities rather_than a hostel it was clean , modern , stylish and quiet .
0	easy walk to all attractions , las rhamblas and is directly between two metro stops making it very easy to get around .
0	the hostel is associated with an entertainment group , de lis group , that hosts the best parties in barcelona .
0	and while the party is not brought back to the hostel kike and pedro are so helpful in ensuring you have the best time in the city with insight_into the best nightlife , restaurants and activities .
0	i would recommend this hostel to anyone , don_'_t think_twice just book it .
0	made barcelona one of my favorite places in all of europe !
0	i ordered glasses from smartbuyglasses . co . uk on 00th of january and i have still not received them .
0	besides from the fact that someone on customer service offered me a discount as a compensation for long waiting but they charged me the full price , and my glasses haven_'_t still arrived !
0	and no one is responding on my emails to customer service from 00 / 00 /_0000 !
0	it '_s been almost a month and no one is informing_me about my order , moreover they are ignoring me !
0	very rude !!
0	!
0	i am very disappointed !
0	!
0	and i wouldn_'_t recommend smartbuyglasses to anyone !
0	i was the lucky recipient of a blue nile diamond_engagement_ring .
0	a year after i received it i sent it back to have it resized slightly - what a dream to work with their customer service team !
0	we dealt_with lesley townsend , who was an_absolute stunner .
0	when it was time for us to get married , we didn_'_t_hesitate to buy our_wedding_bands from here - i '_d guess it was about 00_% lower_than high_street prices and , once again , we received outstanding customer service .
0	i was also lucky_enough to receive - as a wedding gift from my husband ... yes , he is wonderful - a set of earrings from blue nile as a wedding gift .
0	suffice to say that we will never buy diamonds anywhere_else !
0	thank_you blue nile !
0	i '_ve just decided to take up a swimming career .
0	yes , yes , at this stage of life i should just give up and hand myself over to muffin tops and stretchy spandex .
0	but i '_m not quite there .
0	i booked the swim training_course and realised that my string bikini ( the faded one with the saggy bum ) just wouldn_'_t do .
0	after a bit of searching online i landed on the simplyswim website where the prices were much_better_than on others and the selection on offer was astounding .
0	within two_days of placing my order my entire swim outfit - and - gear arrived at my front_door .
0	i look the part .
0	until i get into the water , that is !
0	after a stressful few_weeks in the run up to our move , the day i was dreading arrived and i couldn_'_t have hoped for a more seamless move !
0	workers were extremely professional and so helpful .
0	nothing was too much_trouble , the only item during the whole move that got broken was a lamp that my husband dropped ( typical !)
0	- in fact , they probably packed everything with far more care than i would have done myself !!!
0	by bedtime our new home was in a surprisingly organised state !!!
0	i recommended safe removals to a work_colleague when she moved last month and she can '_t speak highly_enough of them either now .
0	really glad i found safe removals and would recommend them to others absolutely without_hesitation .
0	a very nice fitter named karl came to change two of my tyres for me .
0	exremely friendly and did a very professional job .
0	very fast and convenient service and i would definitely use grippy again .
0	thank_you !
0	great company who offer cashback on all your shopping .
0	have never had an issue and would recommend topcashback . co . uk unreservedly .
0	my partner and i bought contract mobile_phones on a cashback plan through buymobilephones . net in february_0000 .
0	the phones arrived in good time and there were no apparent issues .
0	the scheme was ' cashback by redemption ' meaning that we had to mail in our statements and a voucher every few_months ( with increasing regularity ) through the 0 year term of the contract .
0	complicated and fiddly , but at the first claim date we diligently gathered together 0_months of statements and the vouchers and sent our packages off , awaiting a return of £_00 each .
0	imagine our dismay when we heard absolutely nothing .
0	on contacting the company we were asked whether we had used recorded mail .
0	in their small_print they ' recommend ' using recorded mail and mysteriously , without it , * both * of our packages had gone_missing - despite_being sent separately , at different times from different post_offices .
0	suspicious , much ??
0	£_000 gone as we were now too late to claim again .
0	so it was with some hesitation that we sent our next lot of statements and vouchers off - by recorded delivery .
0	mine were returned because i had missed one of the statements .
0	my partner '_s was paid in full , but when i returned all the correct statements i was only given a part payment - no explanation was ever offered .
0	our third batch of statements has_been sent and we are awaiting our latest payments .
0	an_email_confirmation of receipt from them is dated 0 / 0 / 00 but on 0 / 0 / 00 i am still_waiting to see if i am going to actually receive a payment from them , which can take ' up to 00 days .'
0	i will * never * buy from this company again and have warned everyone - friends and enemies - to steer_clear .
0	it is a scam company .
0	they are incredibly dishonest and deceptive .
0	the way that their ' cashback by redemption ' scheme is set_up is designed to prevent people claiming at every_step - the vouchers which , if lost , cannot be replaced , the fact that non - recorded mail goes in the shredder rather_than being_processed , the fact that they are so picky about which pages of your statements you send (" if in doubt , send the whole bill " - yeah , so i am going to send you my itemised , 00 page bill x 0 ?!
0	i don_'_t think so !
0	), the fact that they take so long to make a payment so that by the time you realise you haven_'_t been paid , or haven_'_t been paid in full , it is ' past the claim date ' and too late to do anything about it .
0	all in all , a very nasty , dishonest company .
0	learn from my mistake and find somewhere_else to buy your phone - it might look like a bargain but it '_s just an elaborate scam .
0	i decided to move from sky to talktalk a few_months_ago from sky .
0	worst decision ever !!!!
0	the internet is lagging as is the tv guide interface .
0	using multiple devices connected to the internet is slow to the point of being almost unusable .
0	so when i decided to move home i checked the cost of cancelling my contract £_000 . 00 not the kind of money most people have to throw_away .
0	so begrudgingly i starting arranging to move the services over to my new home only to find that i would be renewing the 00 month minimum contract something i did not want to do .
0	so i rang talktalk and was told i could transfer my contract to someone_else ( i '_m not lumbering someone_else with this rubbish ) pay the extortionate cancellation_fee in a lump_sum that would be taken from my account or put up and shut up and get on with another 00 months of this garbage .
0	fantastic :-/ i would advise to never join talktalk !!!!!!!
0	!
0	excellent service does exactly_what it says on the tin .
0	brought my son a 0 th generation i pod touch for his_birthday they explained it had a few scratches on it and stated where and it was a lot smaller_than_expected .
0	on the side too so you couldn_'_t notice .
0	it came in original packaging with new charge lead and earphone buds restored to factory_settings my son to this day never new it was pre_owned .
0	saved my self 00_quid on a new one so well happy !!!
0	oh and i ordered tuesday night arrived thursday_morning and lots of text_messages to tell me when it would arrive !!
0	!
0	wow what a company !
0	i '_ve been desperately searching for some katy_perry tickets and this company go above and beyond to ensure you have the best possible seats !
0	excellent communication , despite the bank_holiday tickets arrived special delivery within 00_hours !
0	i would recommend this company to everybody reliable , amazing customer service and attention to detail !
0	i will be using this company in the future to book all my concerts !
0	keep_up the good work !
0	you now have a very loyal_customer in me !
0	i found everything i needed to make my desired dish ( sushi ) and even information on the products , recommendations , and the discounts helped my buy more for less ... will definitely use this site again
0	very pleased with the service i received from partyrama , delivery was fast and all the items were packed very secure so no items broke .
0	would use them again for all my party essentials .
0	i '_ve thought about selling my old_phones for a while now .
0	i chose mazuma due to their other positive_reviews and was pleasantly_surprised at how smooth the whole_process was !
0	i ordered the envelope from them , that arrived a few_days_later .
0	i received an_email a few_days_later as a reminder ( which is lucky as i had forgotten !
0	), popped them in some packaging and took them to the post_office .
0	a couple of days_later i received an_email_stating that they had arrived , a couple of hours_later and another email letting_me know that they had been tested and that the payment would be with me by the end of the day .
0	00_minutes later the funds were in my bank !
0	could not be_happier !
0	just eat has not only provided an excellent service but we have discovered so many tasty restaurants in our area that we probably would never have visited otherwise !
0	the site is easy to use , and cuisines ordered so you can really easily pick whatever takes your fancy that evening .
0	the reviews are helpful to weed out the particularly tasty ones .
0	i honestly don_'_t know what we '_d do without just eat !
0	our weekends certainly wouldnt be the same !
0	my doctor prescribed me ibuprofen , it cost me £ 0 . 00 for 0 packets instead of the nhs prescription charge of over_£ 0 !
0	quick delivery , not a problem at all .
0	would certainly recommend !
0	ordered late on friday_night and chose saturday delivery , panicked a little when i received a dispatched email on the saturday knowing i wouldnt be in during the week due to work , but my package was delivered safe and sound the following saturday as hoped !
0	everything was great !
0	cannot knock the price and quality !
0	look_forward to shopping from boohoo . com more in the future !
0	amazingly packaged , amazing selection , and great prices , can '_t fault a single aspect of the site .
0	ordered a £_00 bouquet which arrived virtually dead and the ' handwritten_note ' scrawled on a piece of cardboard , after emailing them i received a response asking for a photo .
0	after sending this and 0 emails later still no reply .
0	absolutely awful service and awful flowers !
0	most were green_foliage !
0	i highly advise anyone considering this company to think again !
0	i '_ve seen healthier , fuller bouquets in service stations !
0	over priced and utterly awful customer service .
0	i ordered a bouquet for a friend '_s birthday which was supposed to consist of white_roses and purple freesias and paid_extra to include a further 00 %.
0	it looked lovely on the website but when it arrived my friend sent me a picture and it actually only contained the white_roses and didn_'_t look very special at all .
0	i contacted e_- florist and did receive an initial response stating that they hadn_'_t realised that there had been a problem with the freesias from their supplier and that they had decided to go_ahead and send the bouquet without them .
0	they offered to resend a new bouquet or offered a partial_refund .
0	i responded to advise that as the birthday had passed their seemed little point in resending the flowers and enquired as to the value of the refund .
0	i sent this message on the 0th_july , sent it again on the 00th_july when i received no response and then also sent a further message through the enquiry form on the website just to ensure that there was no way it could have been missed .
0	unsurprisingly i have still not had a response .
0	i am completely dissatisfied with the overall experience .
0	eflorist may be slightly cheaper but this seems to negatively impact their customer service which in my opinion is not worth the saving , especially given the time you will spend trying to obtain a satisfactory response !
0	i would not use this company again and would warn friends that were thinking of doing so .
0	i was unsure of what to expect when i began my hnc / d with rdi a year_ago .
0	i have never acheived acedimic success at school and knew i might struggle with the content .
0	however i was amazed to find how much i was suited to distance_learning .
0	i find the subjects interesting and the tutor support great and love the sense of achievement it has given me .
0	i push myself very hard but its paid off and i am 00 modules into my program with only 0 left to complete .
0	i now can '_t wait to start my final year and get a degree and i never thought i would be saying that !
0	distance_learning is the future and i would recommend it to anybody that wanted to achieve :-)
0	ordered a few items with next_day delivery all arrived with no_problems and products of decent quality .
0	really happy with this company .
0	my order arrived very quickly , and the price was the lowest i could find anywhere .
0	i purchased at the beginning of the year , just as the vat rate changed .
0	the system accidentally charged me the new rate early , but the company quickly refunded it .
0	this company took my money , but never sent my order .
0	i tried_emailing them and phoning them for months .
0	apparently it is run by praba thevathasan and francis sathish babu ( who also runs it jack ).
0	but i was never able to get_hold of either of these people , so i after 0_months i have lost my £_000 .
0	really pleased with the selection of products on this site , and the speed of delivery !
0	if you are spending over_£_00 , you can '_t beat kiddicare .
0	their delivery service is great , sending you a text on the day to let you know the delivery time .
0	it doesn_'_t always work out perfectly , as you can '_t select the slot , but you can postpone to the next_day ( again you can '_t select the slot ).
0	but it is much_better_than having a random courier delivery .
0	for smaller purchases , the £ 0 . 00 delivery cost is a bit of a stinger though .
0	brilliant range of products and often the cheapest .
0	the selection of products on amazon is huge .
0	the prices usually seem to be the cheapest compared to other online_retailers .
0	and i love that the postage is free !
0	i have never had a problem .
0	i once had to ask them a question , submitted my number and they rang me through their ring back service !
0	brilliant !
0	they were accommodating with requests and alterations to the activities .
0	this allowed_us to fit in everything we wanted to do .
0	really useful that they sort_out getting payments from a large_group of people .
0	hassle_free .
0	just returned from a hen_party in liverpool and the service provided by chilli_sauce was excellent .
0	we had a lovely 0_* spa hotel with lovely rooms and comfy beds .
0	room service left a little to be desired as things we ordered never showed up and when we tried to order a sandwich at 0am it was going to take them 00mins to bring it .
0	we used the spa in the hotel the day after which from the way we were feeling was much_appreciated .
0	the evening activities were a lovely tapas meal which i cant really comment on as i didnt try everything but everyone else seemed to enjoy it .
0	the bar queue jumps went without a flaw and the club at the end of the evening was amazing with vip booth with a balcony overlooking the dancefloor and a big bottle of moet and a bottle of vodka with a jug of coke .
0	overall very happy with the service provided by chillisauce and the online payment made the whole_process so much_easier for everyone_involved .
0	would definately recommend chillisauce to anyone planning a stag / hen_do in the future !
0	i have always brought my new hair_straighteners straight from ghd as you know that your getting official products as my hairdresser told me that there are fake ones out there that look legitimate and the same price if not more_expensive .
0	the ghd website is easy to use and find what your looking for , they send an_email_confirmation straight after you order and send out the order very efficiently .
0	thankyou for an excellent service ghd !
0	just hope that these ones last as well as my old ones which was 00yrs !
0	i love this website and everthing thats on it !
0	i have purchased a couple of items and will be sure to buy more !
0	quick delivery and great packaging , ideal for gifts .
0	thanks a lot , abi x_x
0	i used to shop at river_island quite_often however started to notice that the clothes i bought from there ( in particular the tshirts ) got holes in them .
0	i wouldnt mind so much if the prices were cheap but when you have other shops that are cheaper selling the same sort of thing its quite annoying !
0	i must_admit that i love river_island handbags and they do tend to last .
0	i find some of the clothes a little chavvy at times and a bit dated .
0	the mens clothes seem to be more fashionable than the womens .
0	i recently flew to spain with ryanair .
0	i was a little_worried at first that i would not be able to sit with the persons i was travelling with as the seats are not allocated .
0	however i need not have worried as we all managed to sit together .
0	there was also a fast track upgrade system in place for passangers to get first in the que .
0	the plane was clean , the staff were friendly and there were drinks and snacks being servered often .
0	i also found there was a lot more leg_room than some flights have .
0	what more can you want from a budget_airline !
0	i recently_purchased a card for a 00th_wedding_anniversary .
0	i had always expected that due to the personalisation and delivery that the cards would be expensive , this is not the case .
0	i was very impressed with the printing on the card as the photo i uploaded was taken from a mobile phone , i expected this to be a little blurry however it was really clear .
0	the card arrived in a couple of days , there was an option for next_day delivery but this wasnt needed in my case .
0	great service !
0	i have purchased a couple of things from this site ( liquorice allsort bracelet and love heart sweet ring ) and i love them !
0	i have had a lot of compliments as the items are so fun and unusual .
0	i will be buying a lot more in future !
0	really quick delivery also :-_d abi x_x
0	i originally chose warrantyshop . co . uk for my multi appliance policy after_comparing_prices between the other_websites i found in google .
0	their silver policy covers all of my essential home items such as my kitchen_appliances , as well as a few of my televisions .
0	recently my washing_machine door wouldn_'_t close properly so thought i '_d call warranty shop to see if i could get it repaired .
0	they sent an engineer out quite quickly and the repair was done on the day , a huge_relief !
0	rather_than the door catch ( as i originally thought ) it was the electric connector which keeps it locked that had failed .
0	i think so anyway !
0	the man was very helpful and i was back washing my clothes 0_days after making the original phone_call .
0	needless to say my pile of washing hadn_'_t grown too large !
0	the £_00 . 00 a month is well_worth it if you know something like that will get repaired that quickly .
0	if i had to be negative about anything it '_s the fact i had to pay a small excess .
0	but from my original research before taking out the policy it seems that some other warranty companies charge this when making a claim so no big deal in reality .
0	i '_m tired of this company '_s broken_promises .
0	every delivery date promised is not fulfilled and they are just incompetent .
0	no - one knows anything and they can '_t find the products in their system either .
0	this is what i '_ve been looking for .
0	they actually charged us less_than what they quoted .
0	will definitely use again .
0	great service and trustworthy !
0	we got a great deal and good service .
0	will use again .
0	surely recommend it to anyone moving home .
0	same day delivery of flowers and cake .
0	fab service !
0	even_though we pay a bit more than other home broadband users , we '_ve had really good service and connectivity .
0	i '_d recommend o0 anyday .
0	the quality of products , service and follow - up is great .
0	highly_recommended .
0	despite having problems with my bank card ( totally down to me ) the health counter were easy to get_hold of , professional and friendly to deal with , and managed to get the payment sorted and my product out to me in very good time .
0	i would highly_recommend them .
0	from_start to finish , the process was simple and well explained .
0	the free post bag was a nice_touch as i never have a stamp so would normally not bother so is idiot_proof and great for the lazy person like me .
0	the payment came quickly with an_email_informing_me of its iminent arrival and the cheque cleared within_00hrs .
0	i will be recommending this service to everyone
0	i ordered a pro - racing bike to exercise from home .
0	i did
0	receive it the next_day before 0 o ' clock .
0	i loved using ths site because it was so user_friendly and they have some great offers on here too .
0	fast deliverly , came the very next_day .
0	great price got a britax_b - dual with car_seat soft carry_cot and second seat plus all the adapters for less_than £_000 !
0	i would defo use again !

0	chemist_direct is my first choice when buying over - the - counter medication or creams .
0	they sell things at a fraction of the cost of a normal pharmacy .
0	delivery is always quick .
0	i have not had any_problems at all with their products or service .
0	fantastic company .
0	love the shops , and did my first online order a week_ago .
0	a little_pricey , but to be expected of imports .
0	i ordered a bargain box , and you get loads for your money there .
0	i can '_t_believe_how much they packed in !
0	i ordered a few extras as well , and they even threw in a free hello panda box .
0	whilst ordering i had a few issues with a voucher , and they couldn_'_t of been more helpful .
0	truly excellent company .
0	great !
0	quick and easy to use and received my cheques very quickly .
0	didnt get as much as i would have liked and 0 mobile we have didnt have any value but would recommend them :)
0	ordered some boots for both of my daughters and they didnt take long at all , they arrived together ( which saved on 0 of them waiting ) and i have two happy girls !
0	plus i used some of my cash_back so only have to pay for 0 pair - bonus !
0	thank_you for great quality products at a great price with a very quick_turnaround .
0	always very helpful and approachable , would definitely use again .
0	posh princess do not have a large_selection and mostly size 0 - 00 but they have some really nice finds .
0	prices are also reasonable :)
0	i have used misco for years but something has happened to their site recently .
0	i dont mind the look but the categories are all over the place .
0	i ordered a belt for my printer and phoned after a week to see where it was only to be told it was out of stock for another 00 days !
0	their other supplier had one in stock but it cost more so they would not send it , not my problem !
0	it was listed at a price and said in stock , i dont give a rats ass if you messed it up i just need the flippig thing :(
0	we usually run our posters on hp large format printers but they use a lot of ink and take ages to print .
0	these_guys use a strange toner machine but the quality is better_than our hp on day glo ( no wrinkling ) and we can resell the prints at a profit :)
0	the service from hq_hair ist fantastic and i was very happy that they add some goodies with my order .
0	i really would do it again ;)
0	booked tickets to see nicki_minaj with the ' double 0 tickets ' company and could not have asked for better service - we bought them online a couple of months before the concert date and the company emailed us saying they would arrive roughly ten days before the concert .
0	they actually came early ( two_weeks before ), so this made us feel a lot more trusting towards the company as we hadn_'_t used them before .
0	when we arrived , we couldn_'_t_believe_how close the seats were to the stage - absolutely perfect view !
0	it was 000_% worth_paying that little_bit extra for such an experience !!
0	they were only 00 pound extra to the orginal ticket pricing , assuring when we bought the tickets it would be the first 00rows from the stage and wow it really was brilliant !
0	will deffinatley use the company again and thank_you for making it such an enjoyable night for us !!
0	a ****
0	i would use this service again !
0	i am self_employed and need my van for work my tyres were replaced in the time it took me to eat lunch therefore i had no down time excellent service just what the self_employed require .
0	i purchased a watch for my husdband '_s birthday and just wanted to say that i was thoroughly impressed with the service i received from iconic_watches and in particular from zac , who has such a lovely telephone_manner .
0	despite_being a bit_unsure_about purchasing online initially , i was completely reassured and impressed by the service you offer - it '_s second to none and i will definitely be recommending you in the future .
0	awesome clothing quality , and quick delivery x one of the best online sites :) thanks always happy :)

0	thanks !

0	i recently bought a personalised item from aspinal and it arrived within four working_days which was quicker_than_expected .
0	i did receive two different amounts for the final price but after_contacting customer_services they cleared everything up for me and very quickly .
0	the only_thing i would like them to change is to give a rough_estimate for delivery so if ordering gifts in future , customers will know when they will be arriving .
0	love asos , have paid for the next_day delivery for the year and it '_s well_worth it !!
0	free_returns and prompt refunds if required .
0	brilliant site and very easy to use !

0	have done some online shopping , and the company who was suppose to deliver the parcel was yodel .
0	after apparent 0 unsuccessful delivery attempts i decided to contact the company i ordered from . they told me they will arrange another delivery for me .
0	fine .
0	yodel tried to deliver again but with no luck .
0	so i went online to check the delivery status and it says : last delivery attempt was at 0 :_00am on the 00 / 00 . hmmm .....
0	strange , because at 0 : 00 i was at home , no door_bell rang , the driver was suppose to contact me , but he didn_'_t of course .

0	i '_ve booked accomodations in england , france , germany , greece , italy , and israel through hostel_bookers and every time there were no suprises upon_arrival .
0	i always felt i knew_exactly_what i was getting .
0	thousands of users and reviewers can '_t be wrong .
0	you get a pretty good idea of what to expect .
0	booking through hostel_bookers is like getting a reccommendation from a trusted friend .
0	a huge_selection of glasses to choose from at really competitive_prices .
0	i '_ve worn glasses for a long time and find a lot of places sell fashion glasses out of my price range meaning i normally buy one pair and can '_t afford to keep a spare_pair ( which is a shame as my little_boy tends to break them often ).
0	with selectspecs i feel i can purchase several_pairs for the price of a pair in leading opticians .
0	i purchased two_pairs to begin with as i wanted to check the quality , i must_admit i was sceptical and thought low_prices must equal low quality - i was wrong .
0	both_pairs have arrived and both are brilliant quality , i '_ll now be looking to buy more as it '_s always nice to have a variety .
0	really great company , fast delivery and competitive_prices , can '_t fault them .
0	have recommended them to all my friends too .
0	mobile phone of less_than 0 month_old sent in .
0	valued at around £_00 which was bad enough but then had an_email to say it failed testing as it was locked to a network !
0	like most i would imagine .
0	they then said it would be worth £ 0 . 00 and if i didn_'_t want it £ 0 . 00 to send the mobile back .
0	do not use this company .
0	absolute cowboys !!!!!
0	!
0	first time using this company , had seen an advert somewhere and thought it might be a good idea to give it a go .
0	i am so glad i did !
0	the offers were great , and the checking and choosing of all the available options was really clearly_laid_out on the site .
0	the prices were great in my opinion , much_better_than if i had gone to a highstreet_opticians .
0	inputting my prescription information was really easy too , which was the bit i was worried_about ; i didn_'_t want to get it wrong obviously .
0	they keep you updated every_step of the way , and you get a tracking_number link in your email , so you can check where your glasses are in the process .
0	from order to delivery was five days .
0	this was 0 pairs of prescription glasses , one with anti_- glare .
0	i thought this was really fast .
0	the actual glasses themselves ...
0	very pleased !
0	quality was good , looked like they did in the photos , and it was nice to be able to see again !
0	( my old glasses broke a couple of weeks_ago so have been getting through the days fuzzy eyed ).
0	no marks on the lenses and perfectly clear vision again , so they definitely got it right .
0	also , they sent me an_email_saying one pair was ready while the other wasn_'_t so would be sending them separately to make_sure i had at_least one pair .
0	i was happy with this , even happier when the next_morning they both turned_up in the same packet together !
0	a company with common_sense !
0	speaking of delivery , i was dubious when i saw the bubblewrap envelope with my glasses in .
0	i was imagining taking them out in pieces to be honest .
0	luckily , the glasses both came in hard cases , which i didn_'_t realise were free with the order , so all was well there .
0	i will be using this company again for glasses ; their range of sunglasses are very nice too so am tempted ...
0	so if you ' re wondering_whether to go for it , then please do .
0	i had a great customer experience with them .
0	:)
0	everything from booking online to how close the garage was from my house to the service i got at the garage was 0_star .
0	will tell all my friends to book through black_circles thought this was a great service .
0	first month of a 0 year contract and what a shit company .
0	i '_d been with orange years with 000 mins never gone over 0 month with 000 mins with vodafone and i '_m over by 000_+ mins costing 00 +_p per min .
0	all because this company charge you per min not second .
0	i '_m not sure how they get away with this but it '_s discussing .
0	now stuck counting_down the month till i can say screw you vodafone .
0	i ordered some air freshener '_s at short_notice and the customer service team helped my get my order on a short dead line .
0	when product arrived they look and smell excellent .
0	i would recommend and use the company again .
0	hostelbookers made it really easy and convenient to book a last - minute trip to barcelona this weekend .
0	i had used hostelworld in the past , but through hostelbookers i managed to get a better room for half the price !
0	i ordered mira vie shower from this seller .
0	i can say that this is a most wonderful seller and i would highly_recommend it to everyone .
0	the prices of the items are really the best one can find .
0	i had to ask the seller a couple of questions_regarding the shower and i can say that they have the best , fastest and most friendly & professional customer service !
0	they were extremely_helpful to me and answered all my questions very fast .
0	i wish that more sellers were so professional and nice !
0	great price , fast delivery , was easy to fix up and sounds awesome .
0	didn_'_t get the drum_sticks like it said but still pretty cool .
0	thanks .
0	gotta love ebay , fab value , massive_range of choice , virtually everything you could ever want available in one place .
0	great protection if things go_wrong , and the wonderful feedback system means you know who you ' re buying from .
0	pretty difficult to fault .
0	do not use and if you have already commented report them to trading_standards .
0	i have had no replies to any emails no contact number , flowers didn_'_t turn_up , not been refunded had to go to my bank and call it back with proof of purchase .
0	well what can i say , ordered on a thursday_morning and it arrived on the monday_afternoon .... better job than companies in the uk .
0	i '_m a very happy customer ;)
0	i love using supplement_warehouse for my husband '_s supplement needs .
0	they have the best , cheapest prices online and very quick shipping .
0	lots of selection to choose from .
0	would recommend this company to anyone !
0	!
0	as much as i enjoy shopping in hobbycraft , i '_ve found slowly but surely that production selection has_gone down within my favourite section of craft .
0	paper craft .
0	now i understand that it '_s not possible to stock every_single product available .
0	but after a lot of the stores were done up and it seemed like half the products disappeared .
0	i '_ve also noticed it with other sections too .
0	also i find hobbycraft very expensive , seeing as hc is the only big craft store in the uk , you '_d think you wouldn_'_t need to have such high prices on things .
0	i run a business myself and understand profit_margins , but some of hc '_s are crazy
0	we hebben een autostoeltje besteld op_een zaterdag en_de dinsdag erop was hij al binnen .
0	ik kreeg een smsje en_een mail dat hij was verzonden en we konden het via tracking bij houden waar het stoeltje zich bevond .
0	super goede service en_goede prijs , de laagste in engeland en nederland .
0	top dus !
0	very easy to navigate website , with simple booking procedure .
0	great reviews that make choosing someone to stay much_easier .
0	instant_confirmation , would definitely use again !
0	i ordered some £_00 headphones from hifiheadphones yesterday at about 0pm .
0	had an_email asking me to cotact them to confirm some details which i was happy to do .
0	nice to know the company cares_about it '_s customers .
0	the headphones were delivered today around_midday , very well packages .
0	i was really shocked how quick they arrived .
0	customer service was fantastic and i had regular_updates informing_me that the package had been dispatched .
0	i will_definately be recommending these_guys to my mates .
0	fantasic service guys .
0	gratz
0	i have bought from here many_times and have only had 0 item which was the wrong_size .
0	but shoes in particular are the best value and all are amazing and last_forever !

0	!
0	hostelbookers is super reliable when you need a bed .
0	really good experience during my month of backpacking round europe .
0	some really decent hostels and good service .
0	the review system is much_better_than the other hostel companies .
0	fantastic few experiences at poppy & zach '_s .
0	0st was getting my daughters 0st pair of big girl star rite shoes and second was getting my sons 0st pair of big_boy school shoes :_d their so helpful in the store and make a fuss of all children and their 0st time experience getting their feet measured enjoyable .
0	also such beautiful selection of clothes available ( which i '_ll be returning to purchase ) so all in all beautiful store and would a 000_% recommend to friends and family :_d xx
0	what more could you ask of an on - line service ?
0	all the choice i need across nearly all the sports i pursue .
0	pretty well almost always the cheapest , and a trustworthy service .
0	ordered a shovel and it arrived very quickly .. good communication emails to let_me know progress .
0	they '_ve got some really great items would really recommend you take a look
0	really fast had the cheque within 0_days from_start to finish will_definately use this service again thankyou mazuma
0	i have booked a few different hostels in a few different_countries and always had a nice stay .
0	this site is super useful !
0	i used serentaflowers to send flowers and chocolates to my mum for her_birthday .
0	i ordered the day before and they got there on time , no_problems , no_hassle and my mum was very happy .
0	i would definitely use them again !
0	i was mighty impressed with the fab prices ( which were very cheap for the goods i was purchasing ).
0	everything was so carefully_wrapped / packed .
0	i was very happy and would not_hesitate to recommend this to everyone .
0	top_class .
0	i would definitely buy again .
0	amazon is by far the best website for cheaper priced items .
0	can find literally everything on there , whether its from actual amazon or people selling there stuff on amazon .
0	amazon is always really reliable and have fast delivery .
0	if there is a problem with something your always garenteed a reply by phone or email the same day .
0	really recommend people shopping there !

0	items are always good , especially clothing and delivery is always very fast !

0	found viovet via_google , have to say the experience i got was a pleasurable one .
0	i am so glad i chose viovet .
0	brilliant , efficient , i ordered the night before , at 0 : 00pmish , and got the food the day after , my cat had fallen ill , ( urine infection ) and i had taken her to the vets the day before , so when they arrived via city_link the next_day i was so pleased .
0	will recommend you to friends and family , and will be using you again .
0	thank_you so much viovet !
0	had no_problems , delivery and service excellent
0	i would recommend this company very highly , have use them several_times to order numerous perfume .
0	always a good price and quick delivery .
0	i can not call this a service because it is not .
0	you never get paid the cashback you are entitled too and when you contact quidco support all you ever get from them is palmed off .
0	they tell a company will pay in 00 to 000 days and when you contact quidco after 0_months still not receiving payment , all you are then told not to worry as they take 0_months to pay .
0	what a joke
0	i would not recommend this company to me worst_enemy
0	i was really impressed by how easy the site was to navigate , how fast the booking processed and how quickly i received my confirmation by email .
0	i was really impressed that there were no booking_fees as well !
0	i '_ll book with hostel booker again for sure .
0	absolutely fantastic service , received the pre_- paid_envelope 0_days after requesting which contained a well explained and easy return procedure .
0	0_days_later i received an_email_confirming my cheque had been sent out which i received the next_day .
0	would definitely recommend .
0	it '_s the easiest £_00 i have ever made !
0	!
0	i went to see russell brand and sat in the front_row - most insane tickets ever !
0	i was so excited the whole time i thought i was gonna pass out , because he was soo close !
0	i love this website now .
0	i needed help with a lot of different questions including price for sending a parcel , how it works with dropping_off / delivering etcetera and i got very good help from stephanie at the chat !
0	fast delivery , good prices .
0	dont understand_why people choose shitty argos over this store x
0	returned a quad bought for my son for christmas which was faulty .
0	there was no battery_charger included and the electicals inside wasnt connected to the motor properly .
0	the manager said as i didnt have the reciept i couldnt have a straight exchange i would need to pay an extra £_00 .
0	disgusting as i paid via the argos_card and had the payment details on the statement just not the item code , disgusting !!
0	!
0	we '_d had enormous problems with our boiler and over a few_weeks 0 different people came out to look at it and give us estimates .
0	woke_up one morning to find water leaking out of it and into the floor .
0	called pimlico_plumbers in a total stress , within half an_hour of my call they sent luke lawrence round , he gave_me a reasonable quote and set to work replacing my boiler straight_away .
0	he was friendly , helpful and very pleasant , was in my house for 0 whole days and didn_'_t make me feel_uncomfortable at all .
0	the boiler replacement was excellent and he even took a look at a problem i have with my shower before he left and gave_me suggestions on how to cope with the problem .
0	excellent guy , excellent service , excellent boiler .
0	very pleased .
0	i would definitely recommend headscarves by ciara to anyone who is unfortunate to need this service .
0	as ciara has_been through this awful illness herself she know exactly_what i was going through .
0	she made this as easy as possible and made me the focus without being too much .
0	as a woman and as silly as this sounds my hair is important .
0	it might have been short to start with but it was mine .
0	i even had a wee cry and ciara did not make me feel silly or stupid .
0	i didn_'_t have to wait long at all on my order and was much_nicer_than anything i had been shown or seen in the shops .
0	the range was fantastic and i loved my scarves and the fact that they were different made others look at me and other people asked where i got them while sitting in waiting rooms and outpatients .
0	ciara was completely professional and confidential at a time when i needed so much from other people i have no_problems recommending her to anyone .
0	and the scarves are very affordable and good quality .
0	definitely worth_every_penny and tear .
0	i couldn_'_t ask for more and she exceeded my expectations .
0	i bought two tickets for the michael bublè concert back in january for his concert on 0th_march .
0	the tickets arrived 0_days after_placing the order .
0	the seats were great and there was no_hassel whatsoever .
0	i would definitely use double0 again , i would recommend them to anyone for sold out gigs .
0	the concert was fantastic !
0	thanks double0 :)
0	smashed the back of my phone , repairs0everyone helped_me out straight_away .
0	fixed it really quickly and easily and wasn_'_t even expensive .
0	excellent :)
0	ordered some shelf clips with " next_day delivery " as a shelf in the office had collapsed .
0	they didn_'_t arrive .
0	after a couple of days i emailed to query the whereabouts of the item and they said " oh , they should have been delivered - we '_ll contact the couriers ".
0	two_days_later i hadn_'_t heard back so emailed again and they replied to say " sorry , we ' re still trying to trace the items with the courier , would you like a refund ?"
0	i explained i didn_'_t want the refund as i wanted the item !
0	a further 0_days_later i emailed again and was told " we have been unable to trace the order with the courier .
0	would you like a refund ?"
0	as it is now two_weeks since i ordered with the " next_day delivery " i have said yes , fine , i '_ll have a refund and will go back to amazon where they are more_expensive but at_least you know it '_ll arrive !
0	i didn_'_t feel that officenerd really cared whether my order ever replied or not and their constant efforts to get me to accept a refund seemed to be an attempt to get me off their case rather_than an example of good customer service .
0	i placed an order on 0st april with boots . com , it arrived at the local yodel depot at 0am on 0th_april , now on 00th_april it is still not here and is still showing as being in the depot .
0	they are worse_than useless to speak to , don_'_t care at all about customer service , i wish they could be closed_down .
0	boots have been kind in apologising and giving me a partial_refund etc , but they can '_t get any more info out of yodel than i can .
0	i doubt the parcel will ever arrive .
0	if i could give yodel 0_stars i would .
0	great phone service and very informed staff .
0	always a pleasure :) would thoroughly_recommend !
0	sammie_taylor - great quick advice and help
0	my experience buying from ace - canine has_been brilliant , i had a lovely response to my initial statement when i '_d requested a free sample and then when i phoned with a query after i '_d received it the staff on the phone were friendly and helpful and they followed up with an_email later that day .
0	i am confident that if and when i have any_questions the staff at ace - canine are approachable which is extra important as it is a healthcare product .
0	really happy to have found the cheapest price for my dog '_s supplements - bigger bonus that it was delivered free and super quick .
0	like the reminder service too !
0	i compared prices for my broken htc_desire s and bozowi gave the best price by far .
0	they kept me updated through the process and payment was fast .
0	i am so impressed with sell your - laptop , i really like the ethos of the business and their service is fantastic .
0	really easy to use website , kept you informed of the delivery pick_up time and very prompt payment to paypal .
0	would recommend to anyone :)
0	( id_0000000 )
0	got my tickets for one direction belfast in november i did pay alot more than ticket price but dont really care because the look on my daughters face was priceless .
0	after a very tough year and alot of deaths in the family i knew_exactly_what would lift her spirits unfortunately the concert was sold out months earlier then fortunately ( i hope ) i found ones available on this website ................ i got printed out e tickets delivered to me very promptly .
0	im just getting a little_worried after_reading_reviews that maybe we might travel the whole way to belfast ( i have a hotel booked and all ) and not get in and most of all my daughter would be devastated im feelin anxious :-(
0	mr_memory offers a really excellent service !
0	high_quality goods , good price and few time for delivery .
0	moreover , it offers a fast assistance in case of problems .
0	i bought two modules of ram for my laptop , i had some problem to install it , so i contacted many_times mr . memory who provided me a good and fast assistance .
0	mr . memory is simply great !
0	i don_'_t normally_write_reviews but my experience was sufficiently bad that i thought it was worth taking some time to share my experience .
0	from reading the other reviews it looks like precious_little one is a company that , if everything goes well , can offer good value but buyer_beware if it doesn_'_t .
0	i ordered a mattress 0_weeks before my due date as i found my original one didn_'_t fit properly .
0	as it was under_£_00 the charge for delivery was £ 0 . 00 , which i felt was a bit_steep but as i needed the mattress asap , was willing to pay .
0	00 days_later my mattress hasn_'_t arrived - i '_ve called the customer service dept and they said according to their system there were none in stock when i ordered , so it was sent out 0nd_class (!)
0	a couple of days ago .
0	despite the fact that i am sure the website did not say this when i ordered ( or i would have gone_elsewhere ), i have been told its basically tough_luck .
0	this business thinks it is perfectly acceptable to mislead their customers when ordering , then charge them £ 0 . 00 for a second class royal_mail delivery ( which it '_s worth_noting is their company policy ) to be sent out whenever the item finally becomes in stock .
0	i am still yet to receive the mattress .
0	i also e_- mailed the customer complaints_dept who said the same thing in a slightly more polite way .
0	their ordering system apparently says that they had none in stock ( they '_ve even offered to send me a print out to prove it !)
0	and therefore they see no fault .
0	they have neglected to address the fact that this wasn_'_t reflected on the website when i ordered it , so either there is a issue updating information to the website or they think i ordered it in the knowledge that it was out of stock 0_weeks before my due date and for some unknown_reason am now taking time out of my day to complain to them about it ?!?
0	!
0	i can see from other reviews that where there is an issue , the ' customer service ' department seems to be tasked to defend their position , rather_than actually provide any customer service .
0	i would say , if you find similar prices on other_websites ( good ones like kiddicare will price match ), then save_yourself the potential hassle if things go_wrong and shop elsewhere .
0	we all had the best week end such a laugh and so much great things to do if was not for chilli_sauce would have not had the privilege of doing some of the unique things we done !
0	thanks again :)
0	really liked the rug shame i had to return it because it was brighter than i thought and didn_'_t look right in my living_room :( was really quick delivery etc .
0	i would recommend this service because they found the dates and prices i was looking for , didn_'_t charge a million extra fees like some companies do , and the payment processed instantaneously instead of waiting to charge my card .
0	do it !
0	thanks for unlock my iphone
0	we travelled with myferrylink in august_0000 , when they had just taken over .
0	the duty_free shop was not well stocked , my only_criticism but allowable considering they had just opened up !
0	the staff were friendly and very helpful .
0	everything was clean and tidy , if not a bit dated in decor , but perfect for what we needed - a cheap hop across the channel .
0	would recommend !
0	i write with regards to my order that i placed over a week_ago .
0	i have requested twice_now for an rma number so that i can return the product that i bought , yet you have still not replied .
0	you are clearly in breach of the distance_selling regulations 0000 , as you have not provided me with the information that i need to return the product .
0	i am outraged at this poor customer service .
0	i have paid a lot of money to you .
0	i demand to have your telephone_number so that i can speak to someone directly and return my glasses .
0	i have used both yumega_plus & yumove_tablets on my two german_shepherds with great success .
0	one dog suffered regularly with a sore shoulder which caused him to limp badly - since taking yumove_tablets he has not had any further occurrences of this .
0	orders come very quickly & the whole order process is simple & straightforward .
0	never have had a problem with hostel_bookers , usually show the best price .
0	extremely easy website to use and i plan on continuing to use hostelbookers . com
0	my boyfriend ordered a surprise bouquet of flowers for a special day as he was away on a business trip .
0	it arrived the following_day and to make the matter worse , it was left at the door unattended and badly_damaged in torrential_rain and the heavy wind .
0	it was found soaked and lopsided in the corner of my garage door .
0	at that stage i knew from my boyfriend that he '_s ordered flowers and he was quite furious about the delay .
0	he '_s made a complaint for which they responded many days_later stating
0	hi ,
0	please_accept our sincere_apologies for the delay in replying .
0	we request you to contact our head_office on <_external link_removed_> regarding this matter .
0	regards ,
0	iflorist
0	we rang and spoke to the customer service guy_who sounded_like he couldn_'_t care less .
0	he promised to speak to the boss and ring us back re : refund and unsurprisingly never returned the call .
0	it left a bad taste in mouth and it totally_ruined what could '_ve been a sweet experience .
0	we feel appalled this is how they run the business especially at the current economical climate and there is no way this company will survive .
0	business is all about the trust .
0	they lost more than just two customers .
0	i bought a ciate nail_polish set recently .
0	it arrived well_packed and quickly but unfortunately one item from the set was missing .
0	i called customer_services at fragrance_direct , and a really helpful and friendly guy sorted my problem super quick !
0	a new set was sent out free of charge that day , and i didn_'_t have to return the old one !
0	excellent service and brilliant prices !
0	thank_you for the excellent help and advise this evening - fantastic representative and went the extra_mile
0	product very good , but chose to purchase from vetimed due to it being the best price quick post and great service too
0	i decided to look online for my de - flea and wormer since the vets prices are forever rising .
0	was really pleased to get what i needed and it saved me around £_00 compared to going to the vets , i hope the prices stay as good for the next time i need to buy !
0	delivered quickly with no_problems .
0	would definitely & recommend to all !
0	on 00 / 0 / 00 i ordered some dog_food and chews for my dog .
0	i was contacted the next_day with many apologies that they were out of stock of the chews .
0	this was fine , and i was told that once they had received a delivery they would be sent .
0	however , i then had to contact them about the dog_food that was in stock , and asked if it was being delivered , as i had not realised they were holding it to despatch both items together , & the food was needed .
0	this was complied with , and the food was delivered a few_days_later .
0	however , it is now the 00 / 00 / 00 and i have still not heard_anything about or received my chews .
0	& so i am not very pleased with the service
0	truffle_shuffle '_s service is second to none .
0	my orders always arive with speedy service and the quality of the products is always great .
0	they have the coolest selection of t - shirts , hoodies and accessories full of nostalgia that will bring back great childhood_memories .
0	thank_you truffle_shuffle for being officially awesome !
0	smooth_transaction , extremely fast shipping , good prices .
0	product exactly as_described .
0	it '_s been a pleasure to do businnes with !!
0	!
0	i was told about these_guys from a mate . i wanted a welcome home goodie bag waiting for me when i got home on leave for me and my partner .
0	i placed the order while overseas on duty to be delivered so that it waiting when i got hoime .
0	i asked them to dispatch it on a certain day using their next_day service and they didn_'_t dissapoint .
0	an excellent welcome home present was waiting for me and grwat fun was had by both of us .
0	will definitely use again .
0	my order was processed correctly and the item delivered quickly .
0	i would use printerland again with no_doubt
0	i placed my order late on tuesday night , you despatched it wednesday_morning and it was with me on thursday - you can '_t get any better_than that !
0	i was on the point of replacing my pc , but for just over_£_00 the memory i bought from you has completely revitalised it !
0	fitting was very easy and took only about 00_minutes - an expert would have done it faster_than i did .
0	i recently brought a pair of bryan adams tickets ( 0000000 ) for the concert on monday for my partners_birthday .
0	after_reading bad_reviews i am sceptical i will ever get them .
0	what '_s worst is i have tried to change my address so it can be delivered to my work place and it says can not be done .
0	i have emailed regarding this and had no reply .
0	lets_hope i '_m wrong
0	the only_negative_thing ive_ever heard of them is about shipping , but thier motto is true , there is no such thing as free shipping , the cost of shipping is absorbed somewhere , in the price of the product .
0	the prices are low and i '_ve always been happy with my closeout and guarenteed fresh products at hands_down the best price anywhere .
0	rock_bottom prices .
0	low .
0	loooooooow .
0	even when you factor in the shipping , if you buy what you need in bulk , you '_ll find the price per item even with shipping divides out lower_than anyone_else .
0	love them .
0	i have been booking tickets with them ever_since_moving to london , hence for the past 0 years and there is not once that when an event i am interest in is in london i would ever think to check anywhere_else .
0	they are professional , very reliable and trustworthy , best customer service ever .
0	i have just received my ticket for the backstreet boys concert , it is the second time i see them and booked the ticket through this agency .
0	best prices and best tickets .
0	recommended it to a couple of friends as well .
0	maria
0	rubbish rubbish rubbish !
0	i have stopped using my iphone , don_'_t make any calls on it and send maybe a few texts a month .
0	i have a booster which is a unlimited to other tmobile users yet my bill is always over .
0	they are ridiculous charge for voicemail service i dont have , they charge £ 0 . 00 one off fees which is erm every_month and no one can explain_why ?
0	they charge for debit_card payments because i chose not to give them access to my bank ac with dd .
0	and god_forbid you should be late paying your bill by a few_days they continue to harrass you at all hours even on sunday wether you speak with them or not .
0	the worst thing i done was change from my old school flex 00 to a shitty i phone contract i have a few_weeks to go and my 00 year relationship with tmobile is over !!!!
0	woop_woop ........
0	tmobile cs has just said that repeating my disdain for tmobile is not helpful !
0	!
0	so i will repeat it here .
0	you are rubbish rubbish rubbish bunch of theives who ruin people '_s credit and give absolutely nothing for loyalty to you .
0	just like british_gas as soon as your momentum gets going you shit on the ' little ' people who help you get there .
0	disgrace disgrace disgrace no matter_how you change your name your still crap !!
0	ee ???
0	dont you mean errant egocentric .......
0	arrrrrrrrrrrrrgggggggggggghhhhhhhhhh
0	good service , good price , fast delivery , great website but i ordered my glasses with a tint and they sent me ones with clear lenses so i am not happy at all , now i have to go to the trouble of sending them back
0	i recently_purchased a silent_night foam_mattress , and i am really pleased with the quality of it , considering it was one of the cheapest .
0	would definitely recommend also it was free delivery so even better .
0	made an online order with sh !
0	it arrived the next_day .
0	excellent service and very pleased with the item i bought , and so is my partner ;) lol .
0	will_definately be shopping with sh !
0	again .
0	this is the first time i have used this company and rest_assured this will be the last !
0	!
0	and i '_d ask people to seriously think_twice before using them .
0	this company has a total disregard for any packages that have been placed under their care especially the ones clearly_marked with fragile and do not bend .
0	is it about time these types of companies and the courier they use were investigated to see how our valuable packages are actually handled ?
0	how many_times have you had a package delivered and it '_s been damaged , lost or stolen ?
0	as for compensation , think again , they '_ll try and wriggle out of any such claim .
0	i think investigations into these companies are long over due .
0	very happy with my daughters halloween_outfit , better quality and price compared to what you '_d find in the supermarket .
0	postage prices were more than reasonable .
0	after looking round the website and seeing what else online jokeshop sell i '_m_sure i '_ll be back !
0	purchasing two items from taunton_leisure , i could not find one fault .
0	very fast delivery and good tracking updates .
0	one happy customer .

0	all the products are excellent quality and the delivery is always very fast .
0	i '_ve never had any_problems with fragrance_direct and i always recommend it to my friends and family .
0	great service .
0	a lot_easier to use than i first expected .

0	i ordered the band hero for the xbox_000 and it arrived in quick time and just as_described !

0	thank_you .

0	ever_since i first discovered them , i only ever order flowers from e_- florist .
0	unlike many places ( where to bouquets are quite tacky ), there are lots of stylish bouquets to choose from .
0	they are reasonably_priced too and always delivered on time and as quickly as you need .
0	i go straight to e_- florist every time !
0	arrived in great condition .
0	great sturdy packaging .
0	very happy !
0	hungryhouse is great when it comes to quality food delivered at your door .
0	the delivery time is followed so particularly and if it is a hungryhouse express order and reaches after 00_minutes you do get a free meal of the same amount .
0	getting this is also hassle_free which is why i found it to be really honest .
0	i would recommend this for all the foodies out there who want to enjoy a nice meal in the warmth of their homes .
0	i have been using hostelbookers for all my weekend getaways , long and short business and pleasure trips .
0	i have used it for traveling with my parents , my partner and also alone .
0	hostelbookers has an_extensive_range of comfortable , affordable and variety of choices on hotels and hostels depending_on your purpose and budget .
0	my every booking experience with hostelbookers has led to a special and memorable stay and i always use it myself and recommend to every traveler and backpacker .
0	very obliging faultless delivery .
0	excellent communication prompt delivery and price will_definately use again and highly_recommend
0	thankyou very much
0	great website with plenty of choices .
0	the details of the garage helped to get in touch as i needed to fit the tyres over lunch .
0	so , the garage advised they would keep an eye out for my online order and book it at that time .
0	would definitely recommend and will return !
0	jv carpentry provided exceptional service from_start to finish and i would highly_recommend them to anyone , in fact i '_m going to recommend them to everyone !
0	i wanted bespoke bookshelves and cabinets fitted into an alcove .
0	jeff was very flexible when organising a time to come round and take measurements .
0	then my expectations ( already high from seeing the pictures on the website ) of the work done were surpassed by miles - the guys who came to build the bookcase and then the two painters who painted them in_situ were extremely punctual , professional , and highly skilled .
0	the finished_result is truly stunning and fits seamlessly into the alcove space - they even perfectly reproduced the coving so that the bookcase blends into ceiling as if it was built with the house .
0	the price was also very reasonable .
0	i am now thinking of what else i would like them to build for me !
0	item arrived before expected which was great , was well_packaged and as expected .
0	any question si had were answered really quickly and professionally .
0	very happy !
0	will shop with them again
0	i have been planning a trip to europe for several months now , and hostelbookers has irreplaceably contributed to making things so much_easier to work out .
0	i know that my reservations are made , will be there when i arrive , and it is so easy to compare and choose exactly_what i want in a hostel with this site .
0	thank_you !
0	excellent service , reasonable_prices and fast delivery .
0	highly_recommended !
0	our 0 year_old daughter is delighted with her new scooter :)
0	so on the 0th do december requested my iphone 0 to be unlocked so i could use my
0	work sim .
0	i got told on the phone this will be done in 00 days ..
0	so i paid the fee
0	so far so good .
0	a week_later i received a text stating my imei_number was incorrect
0	i was sure this was a mistake as i read the imei_number directly off my phone anyway
0	phoned up and i was told to ignore the text and that they only needed a few details
0	of the make and model of the phone so i happily gave this information .
0	i called on the
0	00th_dec saturday and the advisor on the phone said my unlock_code will be sent to
0	me on a 00th_dec tuesday woohoo i thought .. very wonderful and fast .
0	tuesday came no text so i phoned again ., this time i was told over the phone that my phone was stolen .
0	and it could not be unlocked .. urm huh ?
0	i was shocked my phone was bought from new so i challenged the rep over the phone and he finally said he would get back to me in 00_hours .. hmm u guessed it no call was returned so i called again and this time i was told the delay was solely due to the fault of apple and that i was told the unlock_code will take 00 days so i should be patient okay i said i understood that but i was basically told by a previous advisor that the code was going to be sent on a specific date and was also told that my phone was stolen so got a bit_worried .
0	anyway 00 days was up on the 00th so i phoned up again this time spoke to a manager who told he was going to call me on the 00th with the unlock_code
0	hmm u guessed it no such call has_been received so just called again before writing this review this time i have been told to wait indefinitely as t mobile can only
0	request apple to unlock the phone and it '_s up to apple so basically i can be waiting
0	for eternity for this .
0	so basically paid money for a service that was meant to take
0	00 days now is more like unlimited days .. this is no way to conduct_business not
0	surprised ee was voted worst mobile provider off 0000 .. really angry .
0	unlock my phone !
0	superb service through out and t - shirts are excellent .
0	will_definately be getting somemore .
0	cheers peacefulhooligan .
0	have order from tru print several_times and have always been more than pleased with the variety of gifts available and the quality
0	i have had positive_experiences with wowcher in the past .
0	however these have been transactions where i have had no_problems .
0	i recently ordered a wowcher for an item of clothing over a month_ago .
0	the retailer sold out of items in my size , and now advise that the item is now discontinued .
0	the retailer advised i needed to speak with wowcher as the original transaction .
0	i have now made a number of phone_calls and responded to an_email which has now probably cost me the price of the wowcher again !
0	no one seems to want to take_responsibility for this and i '_ve effectively paid for something i can '_t have !
0	this is my second time using this company .
0	excellent selection of products to choose from .
0	ordered a pair of sunglasses and there was no_hassle at checkout , very smooth_transaction .
0	i got a confirmation_email within a matter of seconds .
0	the glasses arrived very quickly and were exactly as_described .
0	would definitely recommend .
0	i booked a ticket for £ 0 . 00 on the 00th of november .
0	however , once i '_d paid , the confirmation_email said that the ticket was valid for the 00th of december .
0	i was then accused off ' booking the ticket incorrectly ' by an abhorrently rude customer adviser , so i took a screenshot of the date and price of the train_ticket as advertised on the trainline app .
0	i finally_managed to get a phone_call from a supervisor who acknowledged that there had been an_error on the app .
0	he agreed that it wasn_'_t my fault that the trainline had made an_error and advertised a train_ticket for the wrong date .
0	however , he said that there was nothing he could do to help as these tickets are non - refundable .
0	absolutely_disgraceful .
0	he then shouted down the phone as he read me the terms and conditions of a ticket which i did not want !
0	my only other option would have been to book a ticket for £_00 , thus paying the £_00 difference as well as a £_00 changing fee .
0	i did not cause this mistake , so why am i paying for it to be fixed !?
0	why on earth should i pay the trainline for making a mistake ?
0	it '_s honestly beyond_belief .
0	i understand that tickets are non - refundable , but , if the trainline are responsible for false_advertising , they should take_responsibility and refund the ticket .
0	i am a loyal_customer of the trainline .
0	i book with them on a monthly_basis , and they would definitely have made more money by refunding the £ 0 . 00 they stole from me than losing my custom .
0	absolutely_shocking , disgusting , and probably illegal .
0	i will definitely be taking this further .
0	i spent my first day at university waiting four hours for a delivery .
0	i had specifically booked a time and date for the delivery to come so that i would have all the essential items i needed .
0	i phoned customer_services who told me that ' the driver wasn_'_t going to come '.
0	nobody phoned me to tell me that the driver wasn_'_t coming , so i wasted a whole day waiting in the lobby of my accommodation .
0	asda didn_'_t give me a reason for the lack of delivery and said there was nothing they could do .
0	i explained that i had just arrived in a new city and had no duvet , pillows , bedsheets , cooking_equipment or towels .
0	the lady i spoke to was rude , lacked empathy and literally asked , ' what do you want me to do ?
0	'.
0	i have never_experienced_such awful service in my entire life .
0	i am not one for writing_reviews , but i have never felt so stressed and upset .
0	asda didn_'_t even have the decency to tell me that my items weren_'_t going to arrive .
0	they didn_'_t even understand their obligation ( and obvious ability as a multimillion pound company ) to provide the service which i had paid for : to get my items which i had paid for on the day i was promised .
0	really terrible experience .
0	do not use unless you want stress , hassle , and to rack up a huge phone bill trying to get answers out of badly trained , useless customer service assistants .
0	this website is quick and easy to use i was looking for inspiration and found it straight_away !
0	cant_wait to receive my item
0	used these twice_now and both_times the claim items are missing , my partner and i checked everyone of the items and they were all there .
0	it just so happens it '_s the higher value items seem to be missing .
0	my first order i sent a box set , they claim a disc was missing ( even_though i '_d checked them all ) so gave_me nothing , their policy_states they won_'_t send back items or allow you to dispute them so you have to just accept it .
0	thought we '_d give them a second chance with another order - same problems again .
0	also we got payment via bank_transfer even this is slow , after sending an_email_saying payment has_been sent and would take 0 working_days the 0st order took 0 working_days and i even emailed customer service but got no response , the second order is currently at 0 working_days at is not yet been received .
0	who takes 0 working_days for bank_transfer these days anyway .
0	so overall disppointing , a good way to declutter if your not too bothered about making money on your items .
0	we won_'_t use again .
0	side note - this company is deliberately blocking negative_reviews to boost there positive_feedback .
0	i '_ve send in proof of purchase but still under investigation by their customer service - notice how non of the positive_reviews get blocked / investigated .
0	steer_clear of this company .
0	so i had two parcels that needed collecting and delivering .
0	so i used city_link .
0	they sent the shipping labels and i attached them to the packages .
0	it was a next_day service so they picked_up and then delivered the next_day as expected .
0	they even sent me and email and text to say the parcel was delivered - excellent !
0	or so i thought .
0	i then discover that the had some mixed up the parcels and delivered both to the wrong_address .
0	how is this possible - their shipping label was attached to each parcel - but they ignored this and sent them both to the opposite address .
0	i '_m fuming now - one of the items is a £_000 lens .
0	luckily both the people who received the parcels were understanding , helpful and honest .
0	i contacted city_link they appologied then said they would re - collect the parcels and deliver them to the correct destination .
0	not ideal but i guess at_least they trying to reticfy the problem .
0	but guess where they tried to collect the parcel from - the original collection_point !
0	i mean are these people for real ?
0	it '_s like a bad comedy show .
0	i '_ve actually got my partner to pick_up the parcels and deliver them himself so that the high value parcels get to their destinations .
0	considering we live in telford and they were going to middlesex - this is really inconvient .
0	on top of that city_link won_'_t refund the postage because and i quote ' we delivered the parcels on time ' obviously their t '_s and c '_s don_'_t state that they actually have to deliver the parcels to their intended destinations .
0	i won_'_t ever be using city_link again .
0	i mean i '_m_sure if you wanted to post an item and it end up at completely the wrong_address then they are great .
0	it '_s like a big game of pass the parcel when it arrives it '_s a surprise to see what you have actually received .
0	but it '_s unlikely to be what your expecting !
0	oh and it may also be soaking_wet like one of our parcels - i think they thought having fragile written across it mean they should throw it in a river and try to fish it out again .
0	so many big chain companies have fallen recently , how are bhs not one of them .
0	their customer service is truly shocking .
0	i placed an order on - line , got an_email_confirmation and i though that was it .
0	a few_days_later i noticed i '_d been refunded for my purchase .
0	so i logged on to my bhs account only to find they had cancelled my order due to ' item no_longer available ' no - one bothered to contact me to inform_me of this .
0	so i send an_email to their customer service - which has_been ignored , so i logged on to their facebook_page and sent a message their - also ignored .
0	a simple email or phone_call was all i expected to inform_me that they could not full - fill my order but they don_'_t seem to respect their customers enough even to do this .
0	i '_ve always admired bhs having shopped in their stores frequently , this was my first on - line order with them and it is also my last ever purchase at bhs .
0	the website was easy to use , and allowed me to find exactly_what i was looking for and purchase online - no more phoning loads of garages to check stock and book appointments .
0	great service ...
0	i '_m british , my family live in england but i live in the states .
0	i wanted to do something special for my mum '_s birthday because i couldn_'_t be there and i figured interflora would be a safe bet ... wrong !
0	when she got them some of the flowers were dead , some had literally grown fur and mould , she had to through them straight out because they smelt so bad being that they were rotting !
0	needless to say she was disappointed and i was gutted .
0	never using interflora again !
0	a website messed me around with my order so i looked them up on google which lead me to here .
0	i '_ve been shopping online alot recently and the reviews here have helped_me alot with deciding who to buy goods from and who to steer_clear of .
0	( however with people posting so many reviews with pretty_much the same spammy reviews i don_'_t know how much i can_trust the reviews on here , scrapping the whole ' our friends ranking ' section would probably lead to more honest_reviews and not people seeking ' fame ' or maybe make people elaborate more on their experiences ).
0	a huge_range of items available , fast delivery and fair prices , used the site on several_occasions and never once had a problem .
0	' very ' sent me an_email with a code for £_00 off , redeemed the code and got no discount , turns_out the discount comes off my next order , the email said nothing about that and implied that it was for my current order .
0	took_advantage of a ' 0 for 0 ' on tops offer , only came to £_00 total for 0 tops .. oh plus £ 0 . 00 delivery .. only 0 tops came as the other was out of stock .. two_weeks_later the other top turned_up , charged me another £ 0 . 00 for delivery and tried to charge me another £ 0 for the top , argued it and they knocked the £ 0 off like they should ( esp as the promotion is still running !)
0	but still got charged the £ 0 . 00 !
0	so in the end payed £ 0 delivery which was the price of one of the so - called ' free tops '!
0	used a buy now pay next year code , tried to pay it off they said i have to wait_until the following month , following month i tried and i '_m charged interest .
0	when trying to order by phone they keep trying to sell you other items , even if you say you don_'_t want anything_else they still try to pressure you into their overpriced junk !
0	they ' re always phoning to tell me about their awful promotions that i do not care about , i ask them not to but next_day i '_ll get the same call from another person .
0	delivery costs far too much , esp when it takes a week to get here , i live in a main city not out in the country or anything like that so i have no idea why it takes so long .
0	very . co . uk has put me off using any other catalogue , they are awful .
0	despite the website saying the packaging is discreet i was still a little_worried , however they were true to their_word , plain_packaging , on the side of the label it said [ company name_removed_] in a tiny font which most people wouldn_'_t even notice .
0	i placed my order around 0am on monday and qualified for first_class royal_mail tracked delivery ( 0 - 0 working_days ) .. my order came the following_day before 00am .
0	the items are of high_quality and if you check out the ' deal of the day ' you can grab_yourself a bargain for a few_quid !
0	overall this was a pleasant shopping_experience with no embarrassment from shopping instore .
0	i '_d heard of the site so assumed i '_d be fine using it , wasn_'_t until after i placed my order that i even thought to read a review , found loads of bad ones and a few good ones , but seeing as how i already ordered thought i could be one of the lucky ones and get my stuff .
0	my order status changed the following_day , thought my order is coming , few_days_later get an_email_saying they arnt sending either of my items and to contact them .... but also they will keep trying to get_hold of one and not to contact them for 00 days ?
0	wth ?
0	just googling the top line of my email got me loads of people with the same problem , site seems happy enough to take your money but they don_'_t have any of the items instock despite saying so !
0	used this site for the sake of saving £ 0 , not worth the hassle at all .
0	avoid website and stick to one you can_trust .
0	i was desperate to go and see beyoncé in concert and couldn_'_t get tickets when they first came out on sale , i '_m not an impulse buyer therefore i checked out viagogo several_times read terms and conditions and got feedback from fiends who have previously purchased tickets from the site before buying tickets myself !
0	i finally found the right price tickets for the concert and booked the tickets however i was worried as i ordered the tickets with only a week before the event , i kept checking my emails and my online_banking , i then received an_email less_than 00_hours after ordering the tickets and that is when money was taken out of my account and the tickets then arrived the next_day 0_days before the event !
0	very happy with the service received from viagogo and would use the site again !!
0	!
0	unbeatable prices , swift delivery and website is excellent , easy to navagate around , there description and details about each product is really usefull .
0	not always had my exact product in stock when ordered but very quick to make a mend and get me as close or the next best thing .
0	highly reccomed using echo supplements .
0	first of all i did the silliest thing ever and purchased my mattress prior to reading online reviews .
0	once i read the reviews i was very skeptical_about the company and wasn_'_t sure my mattress would turn_up in good time or at all .
0	much to my amazement i ordered the mattress on wednesday_morning 00st_dec and was sleeping on it thursday 00nd_dec .
0	the delivery of the product was excellent , being 0months pregnant i have been finding it very difficult to sleep , and waking_up with severe cramps , but last night was the best sleep i have had in months .
0	still have cramps but nothing like before and this is only the first night !!!
0	i also got two free pillows which are amazing .
0	there is a slight smell from the mattress , but nothing major .
0	i have already_recommended this company to work_colleagues and will_continue to do so .
0	many_thanks zleeps !!!
0	for your good customer service , fast delivery and giving me the most comfortable sleep i have in a good while .
0	this website is a must for any online seller who uses or is considering using paypal .
0	it confirmed that i was not just experiencing ' bad_luck ' in my dealings with this company and that they are well , bordering on criminal in their behaviour .
0	they gve lots of useful_information on how to get your money back from the paypal cowboys .
0	if you have a small online company , especially if you sell items that are likely to be returned , clothing , bridal , do not use paypal as your only means of payment .
0	check out this site to see why and read all the horror_stories !!
0	great site !
0	!
0	as a seller more often than a buyer i found that paypal are the worst company i have ever dealt_with !
0	they barely operate inside uk trading & financial law & freeze customer '_s account for no reason so they can make a few extra millioin £ s profit from their customer '_s money !
0	they always side with the buyer as it is cheaper for them to do this , even if the ' buyer ' is a repeated and known scammer & you can prove they ' re lying !
0	the only_reason they get away with this & are not on watchdog every week (!)
0	is ' cos they don_'_t tend to rip_off ' customers ' only retailers who have little or no recourse that does not involve costly litigation .
0	they have even ripped_off several charity websites ( the hurricane katrina site is one ) who , by their nature receive a lot of funds very
0	quickly .
0	they freeze / limit the charity '_s account , the charity end up refunding the donor '_s money so they can donate to the charity in an_alternative way and paypal , god_bless ' em keep the reversal fees !
0	from a charity !
0	not a company i shall deal with again no matter_how easy they make purchasing on - line .
0	principles have to take precedence over convenience surely ?
0	!
0	i run a couple of online stores and have always found couriers were just too expensive to use , despite the better servive they provide compared to royal_mail ( sorry royal_mail !).
0	a friend introduced me to this site and i thought it was too good to be true !
0	a dog bed that would have cost me between £_00 & £_00 to send on a 00 hour cost under_£_00 for 00 hour service .
0	site was easy to use , very customer friendly and i will definitely use again for business and personal use and have already_recommended parcel0go to several friends and customers !
0	keep_up the good work !
0	!
0	i spoke to mark on monday_afternoon to see if i could get a number of bespoke usb ’_s made and delivered by friday .
0	as the usual turnaround time is 0 working_days , i thought this was probably a bit of a long_shot .
0	mark managed to pull out all the stops and the usb ’_s were delivered early on the thursday_afternoon .
0	very happy customers .
0	i love being_able to get exactly_what i want on a necklace .
0	this order was a gift for a friend with an unusual request .
0	the team at mynamenecklace were great .
0	they flagged the unusual nature and double_checked with me - which i appreciated as it meant they got it spot_on !
0	plus - if i had made a typing_error they would have saved me wasting my money .
0	great communications all_round .
0	i got my order fast and i am delighted with the quality of the necklace and text .
0	will order from you again .
0	thank_you !
0	the site was really easy to use .
0	once i had filled my basket with stuff the payment process was simple and fast as well .
0	i had my items arrive within 0_days of ordering which was much_faster_than i expected too .
0	i would use them again and have already_recommended this website to friends .
0	would fully recommend whittards to tea and coffee_lovers , though i may be slightly biased as i used to work for them .
0	would like to have a shop closer to me again as the nearest is over 000_miles from me and i like to see and handle products before i buy .
0	( i am comfy buying products from the online shop that i know , tea , coffee and hot choc but not the china )

0	i recently ordered two tickets for the wanted through see tickets .
0	i got these tickets on wednesday using a presale code .
0	the tickets i got were for the nottingham arena show on 0st april_0000 .
0	my original seat_allocation for these tickets were block 0 row a and seats 0 and 0 .
0	on friday_afternoon however i got an_email from see tickets saying that due to production change my seats have been reallocated to block 0 row n which is quite high up .
0	so i phoned see tickets to see why the seats been changed and they said due to production changes for example stage layout which is out of there control the only_thing they could offer me was a refund .
0	i took see tickets up on this offer hoping that i would be able to get better seats in the general sale on the saturday as don_'_t like sitting to high up .
0	anyway this morning i got up in time for general sale and the good news is i managed to get seats for block 0 row a seats 00 and 00 which i am satisfied with .
0	what happened next disgusted me the most .
0	i decided to have a look at see tickets site this afternoon only to find that the original seats i got ( which i couldn_'_t have because of ' production change ') were back on sale on there site but at a higher price .
0	i did a screen_shot of these tickets being back on site which i '_ve attached on this email .
0	i also have the email of confirmation of the original seat booking and also the reallocation email .
0	i am very upset with the stress see tickets have put me through just to what seems to me get more money out of the tickets there selling .
0	i ordered a pair of headphones of the site .
0	after i received the headphones i discovered that they didn_'_t work .
0	so i emailed wowcher and the advised that i needed to contact the supplier ' chimp electronics ' so i emailed the seller about the faulty pair .
0	a day later they emailed me back advising that they '_ll send another pair if i supply them with an address so i sent them an_email with my address .
0	a week_later i still had not received the new pair so i sent another email to which they replied_saying they haven_'_t received my address so i resent the email with my address .
0	after another week and still no headphones i sent another email to which they didn_'_t reply to for a few_days .
0	so i emailed wowcher it '_s self who haven_'_t even replied to me .
0	chimp electronics did eventually reply_saying they '_ve sent the replacement pair but will send out another pair this was 0_days ago and i '_m still_waiting and i reckon i never will see a working pair of headphones or see my money .
0	viziononline helped our small business to become a national , well established company .
0	the service is always personal yet professional at all times .
0	no matter what time of day it is you can contact viziononline and expect an excellent service .
0	they will do their best to get to know their customers individual_requirements and enusre you are always satisfied .
0	even if you are not comfortable with computer jargon they will help you understand in a basic language so that you are aware of what opportunites lay ahead of you .
0	they have made me look at my business in a different way , now the world is our oyster .
0	after order a playstation from two other_places and being_messed about i ordered it from simply_games with only 0 working_days before christmas it arrived the next_day .
0	the delivery company dpd even emailed me with an_hour_slot of when .
0	they would be with me .
0	i was extremely pleased with the service and would definitely use them again .
0	i ordered the handbag late friday_night , by monday_morning i had received a email to say my order was on it '_s way and by tuesday it had arrived .
0	very impressed with the speed of delivery considering it was free .
0	i would absolutely use again .
0	i ordered a couple of containers and a trackable window cling ( and a few other things ) one of the pots was badly_cracked due to it being poorly packaged and the window cling tracking_number did not match the copy tag so i now have a useless trackable in my car .
0	i did open a call with geotees and they have said it will be rectified in a few_days so hopefully not all bad :)
0	the other products i got were very good quality , the order process was easy and the delivery was quick .
0	selling my phone to mazuma was so much_better_than trying to sell it on ebay .
0	i got a great price , the postage was free and it was all done and the money in my account in 0_days .
0	my sister put an order in for an easter_egg to be sent to me , i didnt find out about this till a month after easter when my sister asked me what i thought of it and my reply was ' what easter_egg ?'.
0	it turns_out the courier service was to blame and their courier didnt even seem to know where he had delivered it !
0	he repeatedly changed his story saying he had , then he didnt know , and he didnt even get a signature so we have no idea who ended_up with the gift .
0	my sister then contacted thorntons to ask them for a replacement or a refund , and the cheeky bugger tried to worm their way out of it !
0	my sister eventually got her refund after many snotty emails and an eventual threat to get their amazon store taken down .
0	never ordering from them again , hotel_chocolat on the other hand were excellent .
0	i had the best experience with glasses_direct ...
0	i have never bought glasses online before and like most others i was slightly_dubious_about the whole idea to start with .
0	however , the free home_trial system at glasses_direct is absolutely_brilliant ...
0	it '_s a great idea and puts you at ease for finding your_own style - delivery is prompt too and there is no return postage to pay which is fab .
0	after my first home_trial i ordered my prescription glasses .
0	i decided to be a bit daring and choose a bright colour frame that wasn_'_t in my home_trial_pack .
0	when i received my order ( only a week_later ) the colour did not suit me one iota !
0	nevertheless i gave gd a call and they sent me a returns_form - the staff on the phone were more than happy to help - and even then i did not have to pay for return postage , it really is excellent service , it '_s just a shame other_companies can '_t follow in their footsteps .
0	i am now awaiting my new ( normal colour ) glasses and can '_t wait for them to arrive !
0	thanks glasses_direct - i '_ve told all my family and friends about you
0	i have two cats and it can get very expensive buying frontline from anywhere_else - the vets rip you off and even pets are home are very dear .
0	i have recommended to all my friends to use viovet ; o_)
0	i love moon_bingo .
0	friendly chat rooms , great games , big wins .
0	my wins have came in great to get my kids treats and the chat_hosts have got me through some long nights :)
0	the staff in the showroom were every helpful & arranged fitting of my new gas_fire as well as removal of the old one .
0	it looks fantastic & couldn_'_t fault the service .
0	the fire is in within 0_weeks of my first visit to the showroom .
0	a great company .
0	fast delivery , good product information and a helpful customer service team .
0	thanks you !
0	excellent received within 00_hrs of ordering .
0	will def use again :)
0	very pleased with the service i received from_start to finish .
0	will defiantly be using again .
0	0_* service prompt delivery & excellent value .
0	will def be back again
0	whilst trying to book flights on this website , the times and prices constantly changed .
0	we then rang up and the prices were actually £_00 more .
0	after this , they would not let us book as they had messed something_else up in october ( booked a hotel room , then cancelled it , then charged us twice ) which was blocking my account .
0	i called to sort this out , ( this was the fifth phone_call by now ).
0	i told the woman i spoke to about 00 times that i couldn_'_t book but she continued to ask me for my booking_reference , i then asked to be put through to a manager , was put through to customer_services who i couldn_'_t hear properly , then they put me on hold straight_away .
0	i stayed on hold for 00_minutes then hung_up .
0	ridiculous .
0	never using them again .
0	i ordered flowers for a friends 00th_birthday .
0	they never arrived .
0	what is worse , is i have contacted_iflorist two times ( they seem to have no customer support number ) and they have ignored both my emails , not even offering an explanation or apology .
0	i would never recommend using this company .
0	they just take your money and are an unreliable service .
0	who sorted my order out and got it out on time even_though i was a real pain in the neck .
0	basically i reordered twice becasue of my hair trials and she didn_'_t mind and made sure the items got to me well in time !
0	xx awesome
0	helpful especially on rebuilding poor credit .
0	!
0	i live in a village and when i got a brand_new phone with their contract they said i live in a strong orange network area what a load of rubbish that was i have to stand by the back door just to get a signal i can '_t get it anywhere_else around the house so i would not recommend orange to any one
0	ordered from this site twice and have no_problems with them .
0	delivery is on time , very good prices of the products .
0	beats the high_street for sure and more choice too !
0	called me at 0 . 00am to confirm a time_slot , was polite and cheerful when they arrived .
0	quick service , they did not disappoint .
0	would recommend and will defiantly use again .
0	back in jan we ordered an item through an ebayer , who chose hermes & 0_weeks_later no delivery , no calling_card etc .
0	the seller called them and they said delivery had been attempted twice !
0	well why was there no calling_card ?
0	chasing and chasing , another week_later and we finally have a card through the door - 0rd and last attempt it said !
0	i can put money on it that it was in fact his first_attempt !
0	he left a scribble of a number on the card - so had to guess most of the number , he didn_'_t have much to say when he was proven to be a liar and that he hadn_'_t even attempted to come and deliver .
0	i mean what do they do ?
0	sit at home nicking peoples parcels and saying they '_ve delivered them ?
0	i mean really !
0	as we work during the week he was unhelpful by saying he can only deliver during the day and midweek and he cant leave the parcel in our garden or coal shed because he cant come on our property ??!!
0	what the heck !
0	i have never_heard such crap from a courier .
0	eventually we had to get him to throw it over our garden wall and hope that it didn_'_t get damaged .
0	as he is too frigging lazy to open the gate right next to where he chucked it over !!
0	!
0	0nd experience i had with them was when i ordered something from zaggora - ordered some expensive clothing which i really wanted to arrive quickly .
0	00 days_later - nothing !
0	i had purposely had them sent to work so i knew someone could sign for them , i contacted the company and they told me when it was passed to the courier ... only 0_days ago !!!!!
0	they gave_me the tracking_number , i went online and it said ' delivery failed - address query '.
0	i know for a fact that the office gets a good three deliveries from this company a week - and to be fair the driver is always good , and friendly so i knew that the problem must have been from somewhere in the warehouse .
0	and why the hell don_'_t they tell anyone there was a problem with the order !!!
0	they just left it there !
0	i was so angry i have to admit i sent quite a rude email , but i was so fed_up of being_messed about by this company previously and had spent a lot of money - i wanted the service which was paid for ... they got back to me and said the address was incomplete - well it wasn_'_t when zaggora confirmed my order so im pretty sure it was hermes ' cock up again ... the company had to send a whole new order out - which i did receive within 0_days ... so was 0_weeks before i received a delivery which was suppose to be a max of 0 working_days !
0	!
0	i am now awaiting another parcel ( ordered from a retailer and hopefully the last ever order to be couriered through hermes ) we were told it would be delivered by thursday 0th_july ... what a surprise - no delivery or calling_card as of yet .
0	i will be doing my best to avoid this company and will think_twice about purchasing a item if they are the chosen courier .
0	i '_d happily pay more for a service which i know i will receive .
0	i don_'_t want to pay for a service from a company run by a bunch of cowboys .
0	watchdog should seriously think about looking into them !
0	and i rate them 0 not 0_star !
0	i brought a cello for my friends 00th !
0	they ensured that tis would arrive on time as i ony had a short window !
0	throughout involvment with gear for music i have been impressed by their excellent service .
0	duncan and jon ( in customer service ) were fab in dealing_with any_queries i had , responding swiftly and really going the extra_mile !
0	i am always nervous_about buying over the internet but would reccommend their company to anyone !
0	best buy and sevrice i have made / received all year :) five_star service !
0	excited to find my supplement 00 $ cheaper_than the store near by , as well as tons of free stuff !
0	have been with orange for the past 00yrs and never incounted a problem
0	after being_messed about by another company i deceided to place my order with hi_fi headphones .
0	it was delivered on the day they stated with no_problems .
0	wouldn_'_t_hesitate in recommending them in future .
0	this is the second time i have purchased a new car from stoneacre and yet again i have been more than amazed with the service i have received not only while in the buying process but the follow_up service after the deal is done !!!
0	stef and his team go above and beyond to ensure everything is 000_% to your satisfaction .
0	i would recommend buying from them to anyone !
0	after_researching for an_hour or so on sunday , sell your laptop offered the best price for my old laptop .
0	i was impressed that they courier collected it ( incurring no postage_costs ) on monday_morning and the funds were tranferred into my paypal_account on tuesday_morning .
0	excellent service sell your laptop - will be recommending you to friends !!!
0	!
0	a laugh a minute from beginning to end .
0	ticket buying was easy and straight_forward .
0	the show delivered everything i hoped it would .
0	miranda hart was great !
0	very simple booking procedure , instant email_confirmation , hostelbookers has the best deals for budget accommodation
0	we have used meet and greet services at numerous airports before and never had any_issues .
0	firstly we were made to wait around 00_minutes when we first got to the airport and the guy_who drove our car away had no id and could only speak pigeon english !
0	it was the first time we felt uneasy leaving our car with a meet and greet service .
0	on return our car has obviously been involved in a minor incident , leading to two alloys being scratched and a type being_ripped apart .
0	our spare_tyre was on ( replacing the tyre that had been punctured ) and the " chauffeur " - i use this term loosely - had absolutely no idea about what had happened , although he had been driving the car with the spare_tyre on .
0	a complete_joke !
0	we then had to drive home with the spare_tyre on at 0 . 00am in the morning , and spend the rest of the day sorting_out a new tyre and the other issues .
0	attempts to get an answer from head_office have proved futile over the past two_weeks .
0	but until i do , i will be doing my upmost to warn consumers of this company '_s shoddy - and dangerous - approach to business .
0	avoid at all costs !
0	i have used cash_genie twice and they are very quick and professional .
0	i would definatley recommend them .
0	supplementwarehouse . com is my official go to website for all my supplemental needs .
0	their website is very user_friendly , their customer service , even through the internet , is exceptional , and they have all top names available on their site for the best price .
0	i recommend supplementwarehouse . com to anyone and everyone .
0	unfortunately you do not have a choice as a customer ordering online as to who delivers your parcel or picks_up a parcel from you .
0	my first experience amazon asked them to collect something x 0 attempts of waiting in all day and nothing .
0	i complained and amazon sent dpd and picked it up first time when scheduled !
0	this experience - rescheduled online for saturday delivery .
0	waited in all day no - one turned_up .
0	telephoned yesterday and spoke to marcus - told me yodel cannot guarantee to deliver on a saturday !
0	it does not say this anywhere on the help or faq_section or on the website when you click to have it delivered on a saturday , it actually says "
0	thank_you !
0	you have successfully rescheduled your parcel ."
0	marcus then took my telephone no and said he would speak to the depot to see if it could be delivered on saturday 0 june .
0	he then came back on the phone and said , we cannot guarantee we will phone you we will try and re deliver it on saturday .
0	i come home today , 00 may and there was an attempted delivery !
0	it has now been returned to the depot and my arranged delivery for sat 0 june was cancelled !!
0	!
0	what the hell is the point ?
0	they could not tell me why this happened nor why it was not delivered last saturday .
0	yodel make you wait in 0am to 0pm for nothing .
0	they don_'_t apologise , cannot guarantee to deliver or call you - a delivery company who cannot guarantee deliveries .
0	it is laughable .
0	i am going to inform wilkinsons their contract with yodel should be terminated and will report them to watchdog .
0	do not ever ever use them .
0	i always use this site and have done for around 0 years and its products are the same price as other_sites and delivery is free and fast .
0	i have never had any_problems but i am sure they would sort any out , as they are easily_contactable on fb and twitter .
0	they email discount_codes for a certain %_off which keeps you loyal .
0	my order was delivered quick fast !
0	the costume was exactly_what i wanted and i wasn_'_t disappointed on the quality either , it was very affordable however they managed not skimp on the quality of the garment !
0	i sold my phone on the 00 . 00 . 00 .
0	it was received on 00 . 00 . 00 .
0	it successfully passed_testing on 00 . 00 . 00 and the payment line reads " your payment was sent to you on 00 . 00 . 00 at 00 . 00 "
0	i have checked my bank_account every day for the £_000 owed to me and on the 0th working day thought something funny was going on .
0	i decided to email envirophone only to be told i am not receiving the payment until 00 . 00 . 00 , 0_weeks after i started this whole_process .
0	i will never use this company again , i will be telling_everyone i know not to use them and if i hadnt been working all the time would have sold it on the high_street and got the money the same day !
0	!
0	i asked for the phone back and was told i could not receive the phone back as the payment has already been sent !
0	!
0	so in summary they have my phone and they have my money !
0	utterly disgusting company !
0	the whole_process from_start to finish was very quick , this is the second time i have used mazuna and would definitely use them again .
0	excellent
0	this was delivered really quickly , over the xmas holidays .
0	product better_than_expected , well_packaged , and perfect size for my guitar .
0	many_thanks , will use you again in future . ang
0	recently_discovered alpharooms - great telephone service when needed but otherwise completely_hassle_free .
0	great descriptions , quick and great prices .
0	sooo many resorts and places covered !
0	excellent costumer service .
0	product as_described and fast delivery
0	if you call the store , they ask you to contact customer_services which is an indian based call_centre .. great .
0	they '_ve also had my phone for over 0_weeks , after going in store today they said i needed a new phone but the main office were out of stock of them .
0	i requested that the provide me with one from their store room and they said no i would need to stick with the loan phone i have !!!
0	and , if i want to get my money back for blackberry and email service , i will need to request it in writing and it can take up to 0_weeks for a response ...!
0	!
0	i have 0 contracts with 0 and certainly will not be renewing ..
0	i always use paypal where possible to pay for items online , as it stores my details and i dont have to keep entering these in everytime i want to buy something on the internet .
0	the only problem i now have is i spend more !
0	me & my partner communicate using skype all the time , either through the laptops or iphones because we are currently_living in different_countries and in a long_distance relationship .
0	it is a great , free way to stay in touch and it makes it slightly easier been so far away from each other for long_periods of time !
0	i know dont_know what we would do without skype !
0	i would recommend ebay to anyone !
0	i am_currently addicted because there are so many bargins to be had and its so easy to use !
0	i had never used this site until recently & i booked a hotel for 0_weeks in turkey .
0	i was amazed_at how much_cheaper it was compared with other booking sites , for the same hotel .
0	i also got £_00 off my booking with a voucher i had - which made it even cheaper !
0	i recommended to family_members , who also booked their hotel through this site .
0	would recommend anyone looking for a bargin holiday !
0	i have only actually ever purchased anything from boohoo . com on two occasions , but on both of those occasions they have over - excedeed my expectations .
0	there items are cheaply priced ( compared to other_retailers ) and are very good quality .
0	the delivery is excellent as i have always received approx .
0	0_days after i have placed my order and only used standard delivery .
0	i would recommend anyone to shop on boohoo . com !
0	my experience with optical_express was great , from_start to finish !
0	i was 00 when i decided to go for it ( just over a year_ago ).
0	i had thought about having_laser_eye_surgery for a long time but suffering with anxiety , the idea of having it done was scary to me .
0	my prescription was also quite complicated , having one eye significantly more impaired than the other and quite a bad astigmatism in both eyes ... i had always assumed my eyes we ' re too ' complicated ' for surgery .
0	i went on holiday to australia in january_0000 and struggled to decide_whether to wear my glasses and be able to see or wear my sunglasses like everyone else did but be totally blurry !
0	this gave_me the little nudge i needed to enquire_about laser_eye_surgery when i got back .
0	i booked a consultation with optical_express who checked my eyes very thoroughly and told me ( to my delight !)
0	that i was eligible for surgery .
0	they went through all my available options , without being_pushy in any way and told me about the procedure .
0	i went home and thought a little and then decided to go for it !
0	an_appointment was made for me for just 0_weeks_later .
0	i was sent an information pack about who my surgeon would be .
0	this put me at ease further as his experience was very impressive !
0	when i arrived for surgery i was given a few more checks by the surgeon himself just to make_sure everything looked good on the day , between checks we were provided with coffee and magazines , which was nice .
0	i was welcomed into the procedure room by a team of friendly faces .
0	i was put at ease from the outset .
0	the procedure_itself was very quick and pain_free .
0	the surgical team counted down the time left so i knew_exactly_what was happening ( which was great for my anxiety !)
0	after surgery i was checked again and given eye_drops and some information for post surgery .
0	as the anaesthetic wore off my eyes , they felt gritty and watered a lot .
0	i went home and slept for a while .
0	when i woke_up they were still a bit stingy but the first thing i noticed was that i could read the sky_tv guide ... whilst sat on the sofa !!!
0	i couldn_'_t_believe it !
0	this was literally hours after surgery !
0	the gritty feeling lasted no more than a day or so and it was completely bearable .
0	after 00_hours i went back to optical_express for my check up and my vision was better_than 00 / 00 , less_than a day !!!
0	!
0	laser_eye_surgery has genuinely changed my life .
0	no_longer do my glasses fall_off my face when i lean over to pick_up my toddler and no_longer do they steam up when i open the oven door !
0	i can read road signs whilst driving , i can see my phone screen without closing one eye and holding it right up to my face !
0	i can see when i swim and when i wake_up and i can wear sunglasses from my favourite shop !
0	!
0	optical_express were and still are amazing , they still look after me now a year on from surgery !
0	i honestly couldn_'_t recommend laser_eye_surgery with optical_express more :-)))
0	i '_ve been using cashback for under a year and have earned £_000 by making purchases i would have made anyway so i '_m really pleased !
0	it '_s really simple to do , you go to the website you want to make a purchase from through the top_cashback website or app .
0	when i purchase perfumes , i always use fragrance_direct as it is extremely competitively_priced and there are usually special_offers such as discount_codes and / or cashback offers .
0	postage is very reasonably_priced as is the gift_wrapping service which i recommend for presents .
0	pet_supermarket offers amazing value on good quality pet products .
0	i bought royal_canin kitten dry_food at a very competitive price and it means i can_afford the best for my kittens !
0	it '_s great that you get free super_saver delivery .
0	i wouldn_'_t buy my pet products from anywhere_else !
0	i got the introductory_offer for £_00 after my friend told me about it and was so impressed with the amount of meat as well as the size and quality of the meat !
0	i would definitely order from muscle_food again & have recommended it to all my friends and family .
0	i can '_t_believe_how bad this service is compared to iplayer and 0od .
0	constant ads , a snooty pop up yelling at me to turn off ad blocker , picture jumping all over the place , spontaneously rewinds , spontaneously throws in more ads in the middle of a scene then jumps back - horrible !
0	great website , good amount of info and easy to use .
0	i am trying desperately to return an item that has_been incorrectly delivered and after five phonecalls and a total of 00_minutes on hold at various points i am no closer !
0	it cannot be this hard to get someone to help me ?
0	avoid if you want to get on with your life !
0	unfortunately in my opinion ebay is now a place to go if you would like to get ripped_off :(
0	good and trustworthy
0	i bought a nice little metal bed_frame for my neice to be delivered friday and you cant go_wrong for the price !
0	thanks to all who helped !
0	would definitely recommend

0	would highly_recommend this company to anyone who_wishes to sell their phones .
0	quick , efficient service .
0	posted phone one day and received payment the following night , you couldnt_ask for more for this company .
0	used a few ' recycling_companies ' over the past year or so and can definately day mazuma is by far the best .
0	got a good price for my iphone_0gs , posted phone ( by special delivery ) and got same day payment the next_day !
0	amazing !
0	most other recyclers took about 0 - 0_days to pay and when they did , it took 0_days for their payment to clear in my account .
0	i ordered a bouquet of vibrant roses to be sent to my mother - in - law for mother '_s day .
0	the flowers were due to be delivered on friday 00th_march in plenty of time for sunday .
0	when i tracked my order i could see that it still said allocated and not delivered .
0	i tried to contact the company over the weekend using the phone , the ticket raising section and the online help but to no_avail .
0	the flowers were not delivered .
0	i then spent the rest of the week trying to contact the company via_email and phone to find out what had happened to the flowers and to arrange a refund .
0	having finally gotten though to someone , after ten_minutes on hold , all they could do was find out from the florist they had requested the flowers from where they were and then email me back , i felt thoroughly fobbed_off !
0	obviously i no_longer require the flowers as mother '_s day has long passed .
0	they say on their site that they have a 000_% guarantee but i '_m currently at 0 %!
0	all i want at this point is a refund .
0	i would not use this company for flowers , the customer service is awful and virtually_impossible to get_hold of and your flowers won_'_t even arrive !
0	i '_m giving them until the end of the week to sort this out and if i get no joy i '_m reporting them to trading_standards and watchdog .
0	iflorist contacted me regarding this matter and said after investigating i was due a full_refund .
0	i have yet to receive this refund .
0	i have tried contacting them a number of times regarding this matter but they once again impossible to get_hold of .
0	avoid at all costs !
0	went to test_drive the cashqai at nissan wigan - after driving the sportage and being really disappointed with it !
0	i '_m not an easy person to impress but darren took us out , he was knowledgeable , relaxed and friendly making our test_drive a great experience .
0	he hit the right note with us by not being_pushy but knowing everything we asked without having to check .
0	thank_you
0	they reply to customer emails efficiently and are very helpful !
0	great with customer service , when i got sent a faulty top they quickly offered to replace it free of delivery charge !
0	i order from boohoo a lot as there prices are very reasonable and there always up to date with the latest_fashion trends !
0	however the only_thing i would say is that when you receive your delivery they send you a little magazine with an offer code to receive money off your next purchase , which i used and was great but they then sent that same code with my next purchase but i couldn_'_t use it again , bit_annoying but it doesn_'_t stop me from ordering from them !!
0	i think they ' re great !
0	!
0	really good service , i found tickets at the cheapest price around !
0	quite in_advance to the concert so gave a little email to double_check id brought the right tickets , 0 - because i didnt know when they '_d arrive and 0 - because they were so cheap i was scared id brought wrong tickets !
0	but they emailed back that same day , within 0 hours i think and told everything i needed to know , politely and were so helpful !
0	a couple of days_later i got a confirmation call saying they were dispatched .. next_day they were here !
0	love it !
0	willl 000_% be using double0 again for all my concerts and tickets :)
0	i purchased a set of bose ie0 headphones from hifix , i ordered them and they arrived the very next_day .... brilliant .
0	site is easy to navigate , payment is no_hassle and the item was well_protected in its packaging .
0	being the ever sceptic , i was worried that due to the price difference from other shops that my product was maybe a fake ..... this was quickly resolved by a phone_call and email to bose themselves who confirm they are real and hifix are a registered trader of theres :-) so i would definitely use again , worth a look due to great prices also :-)
0	items of bad quality and unsealed so returned items still no refund avoid this company .
0	hi everyone , i changed from edf to first_utility and i wish i never did .
0	ever_since i changed i only have been having trouble with the reading over billed for a two bed house £ 0000 for 0months worth of use of electricity and on top of that when we changed back to edf they said that conveniently the the prices went up by december_0000 and i got billed by the same 00p rather_than 00p for the previous 0months (@ 00p and the last months and a half they charge 00p_per unit ) so they split my bill in two regardless of me using less units for the month and a half so they can raise the leaving bill so they wont owe me any money ( being in credit ) and ending up owing them money .
0	we had a dispute about the readings and that last it 0months and a lot of agro and for something that they suppose to do come get a reading their estimate was over 00000 units and for their own mistake i had to fend of credit collection companies that first_utility forward it my " non paid estimate bill of £ 0000 " .
0	to put it simply , i would not recommend first_utility to anyone they are nothing but useless and in my eyes a bunch of con_artists .
0	we bought a new single mattress for our spare_room from zleeps and we were nothing short of delighted with the service and the quality .
0	we didn_’_t have a lot to spend , but we were happy to try a single mattress from the bronze range as this seemed to be sufficient for our needs .
0	well , upon laying on the new mattress we ’ re both agreed that we are going to order ourselves a new memory_foam_mattress the first opportunity we get .
0	i '_ve been vaping for almost 0 years_now and my current set_up is my trusty but very expensive provari .
0	ive been trying a few disposables for a while now as they are handy for a night out or a spare in the car or what not .
0	im blown_away by the zebra , i love the colour design , but most_importantly the throat_hit and vapour produced is somewhat amazing !
0	the other disposables i have tried you have had to suck so hard just to try and get a bit of vapour and even then it was a tiny amount !
0	i love this product so much im even thinking of purchasing the premier pack for nights out or places where i dont want to lose my beloved provari !
0	!
0	i went for the florida citrus explosion juice and wow its amazing , i love it .
0	next_day delivery too , cant_fault it all .
0	you now have a new regular customer :)
0	this is the first time i have used anything like this website .
0	i usually just go to the post_office .
0	because i live a little way away from the post_office and i am at home a lot , i found that the parcel0go service was brilliant .

0	i was desperate for my tent extension ready for the bank_holiday_weekend .
0	we '_d shopped_around local but couldn_'_t find the one to match our tent ( in moss green ) and came_across this site .

0	i realised after buying hat i might have purchased the wrong_colour so a quick call to customer_services and they confirmed i '_d done it right and that delivery would be the next_day , i had initially selected 0 - 0 day delivery thinking by ordering mid_afternoon 0_days would be a cert .
0	arrived on time , emailed and text to confirm hour time_slot , product fantastic !
0	a very very happy customer , many_thanks
0	i have compared a few different websites for youth hostels and so far this is the best .
0	it is user - friendly and the price seems to be the lowest .

0	i am_disgusted by this service , i have pay monthly for my device to be protected .
0	0_weeks_ago ( 00th_august ) i made a claim as my phone has decided to stop charging due to a fault with the charger_port .
0	i am_currently charging my phone via my boyfriends phone in order to have battery life from day to day .

0	i have been completely let_down by wren living .
0	having made a purchase on sat 00th_january i was told delivery would be monday 00th_january .
0	i got a text_message to confirm delivery would be between 00 : 00 - 0 :_00pm .
0	i took the day off and waited all day and the delivery never showed .
0	it wasn_'_t until after 0pm that the delivery driver told me they wouldn_'_t be coming today because they had run_out of time .
0	no attempt was made to explain what i should be doing to rearrange delivery and no apology was offered .
0	i then spent over 00_minutes calling premium numbers to ask what was going on .
0	i was passed from_pillar to post and each time had to explain my situation .
0	at one point they even told me they couldn_'_t find my order details .
0	i was told that by 0pm today the delivery company would call and tell me when re - delivery would be .
0	have they ?
0	of course they haven_'_t !
0	i cannot_afford to wait in for another whole day for the same thing to happen .
0	my advice do not order from this company .
0	a complete_waste of time and money .
0	you have been warned .
0	very fast and efficient - and cheaper_than high_street pharmacists .
0	not first time i ordered something from here .
0	i '_m satisfied with everything .
0	i will order more from this site .
0	and thanks for great offers :)
0	samantha was an excellent help to me today , she was swift and patient and offered me several options to resolve the problem i had
0	i love all the free stuff and the great prices !

0	so i have had talktalk as a provider for my phone and internet since i lived in gosport in september_0000 , i then moved to ely , cambridgeshire in november_0000 , and despite phoning and emailing them they were unable to transfer my phone and broadband until a month after i moved but that it turns_out was the least of my problems , i added tv to my package when it became_available and then in february_0000 i then moved to benwick , cambridgeshire and began trying to get my talktalk package transferred to the new house , now at first my new address wasn_'_t available on their system , to the point they asked if it was even registered with royal_mail and said they would have to add it to their system and this would take 0 - 0_days , a week_later i then phoned again to find out what was happening and turns_out the request to have my address added had not even been filed so i was told it would take another 00 days - 0weeks , around 0_weeks_later i phoned again - at this point i had already moved out of my old house , it was then they told me that they could only provide me with a phone line at my new address , so naturally i requested to cancel this also involved them asking me if i wanted to put my account on hold for 0_months while i thought about it - not much to think about really as i wanted phone , internet and tv , thinking the request for cancellation had gone_through i continued to set_up my new house with bt as they were able to proivide all services .
0	a month went by and suddenly money for a talktalk bill was taken from my bank_account , now i hadn_'_t used any of their services for over a month and having asked for it to be cancelled i got back on the phone to them , where they passed me from person to person hung_up on me and tried to refuse giving me my money back , until eventually telling_me the only was i could get a refund would be in a months time or unless i filed an indemnity claim with my bank - now i did not see why i should have to wait a month for them to pay back money they had essentially stolen from me so i went_ahead and file an indemnity claim at the bank , whilst on the phone talktalk assured me i would be charged no more money and all charges such as early cancellation charges would be voided as they could not provide me with the services i wanted and they had messed me around .
0	finally i was seeing the light at the end of this rather stressful period , until today ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) over 0_months after my first contact with talktalk i receive and email_telling_me my april bill is ready to be viewed , and this is where i get the biggest shock the bill is a total of £_000 . 00 - listing contract breakage fee charges of £_000 . 00 + youview + box deferred fee of £_000 , so their promises of voiding all charges was clearly yet again another lie and not once did they ask for a return of the youview_box , nevertheless they will not on any circumstances be receiving another penny from me as i have cancelled the direct_debit , and i refuse to pay for their mistakes and lies .
0	got exactly_what i wanted for my sisters upcoming graduation next month , now to choose which one to wear !
0	i had problems with my voucher_code , but i rang the number on the website .
0	the phone was quickly answered , and i didn_'_t even have to be transferred anywhere .
0	i was assisted by a gentleman called david , who sorted_out my problem in only about 00_minutes .
0	makes a great change !
0	thanks for your help .
0	i look_forward to starting the course
0	great service and very quick delivery of the bag and then of the chq .
0	we have ordered day and evening_invites for our_wedding in january and will be back shortly to order the rest of our printed stationery .
0	after an initial mix_up with the colours ( first ours then bride and groom ) i called the company when the invited arrived in the wrong_colour .
0	this was sorted_out professionally and swiftly with the correct order arriving within a week .
0	the quality is ideal and great value for money .
0	i can not sing the customer service highly_enough and have recommended the company to others .
0	westin_gourmet are by far the best online butchers ever !
0	their meat is out of this world , restaurant quality gourmet produce that never_fails to impress .
0	their corn_fed_chicken is the best i '_ve ever_tasted and their steaks and roasting joints are definitely worth a try - bursting with flavour and melt in the mouth texture , you won_'_t be disappointed !
0	they also sell a variety of condiments , continental meat and cheeses and i recently noticed that they have started selling veal which i am desperate to try but have been unable to find !
0	one of the things that i love about westin_gourmet is their rapport with customers , they are so friendly and helpful and their facebook_page is full of praise and nice comments about their food and customer service - it almost feels_like a mini meat community !
0	their deliveries always arrive on time and their packaging ensures that your order arrives fresh and chilled .
0	you '_d be mad not to place an order !
0	i wanted something quite specific so was ready for a long a painful conversation but the guys and sport and corporate awards knew_exactly_what i wanted and were so helpful .
0	great service and i am so pleased with the products that i have received .
0	highly_recommended !
0	xx
0	i needed to get a new door mirror for my daughter '_s car after someone " kindly " smashed hers off .
0	np_autoparts had the best price and a really easy to use website .
0	the mirror was delivered quickly and everything i needed was included .
0	very pleased and will definitely use again .
0	thanks .
0	from the order process to delivery this was exactly_what you want from a retailer .
0	the price was the best i could find , the delivery was free and quick , the communication was excellent and best of all the product was exactly_what i ordered .
0	highly_recommended .
0	the range of clothing and accessories on the site never_ceases to amaze me ..... and the super speedy delivery is just an added_bonus !
0	i bought my brother one of these custom controllers for his_birthday as he is a gaming fanatic , as soon as i ordered i got an_email receipt and then the next_day another email_telling_me my order had been dispatched which was very helpful .
0	all in all a fast and reliable service and a great gift for any gamer .
0	very easy to use registered on line send off my phone and the money was in my account the day they received my phone .
0	0_days from registering it online to the payment being in my account fantastic
0	always there at that time of need and that itself is greatly_appreciated .
0	especially when you are learning as you go along !
0	so you can only imagine the amount of times that i have had to seek support due to myself getting a bit too carried a way with for example : wordpress installation , themes , plug_ins etc !
0	honestly they have the patience of a saint when it comes to dealing_with me !
2	for the price i paid for those ceiling_lights i did not expect them to be as good looking , well made or packed so well and delivered in a flash as they were .
2	i reckon i got a great deal more than i paid for .
2	the site itself has a fabulous range of goods , is easy to navigate , and easy payment .
2	i knew_exactly_what i wanted and very lucky for me google took me to castlegate .
2	next door love them as well , he said " oh so much_nicer_than them other old ones ", which were way , way , over the cost of these .
2	never again will i use an overprice well_known high_street diy_store .
2	you got to see for yourself , here borrow my computer while i make us a cup of tea .
2	the dewalt_drill has made erecting my new shed an_absolute_pleasure .
2	one battery lasted a full 00_hours of working and then some .
2	two batteries are even better , especially when they recharge in only an_hour ...
2	the drill itself has plenty of oomph for those tough jobs , though maybe a little on the heavy side .
2	price_wise it '_s great value .
2	i am a excellent and avid diyer and it '_s going to be amongst some of the best tools i have .
2	delivery could absolutely not be_faulted .
2	delivered on time and by very pleasant driver .
2	website lovely and easy to purchase and very good feedback re progress of order and delivery .
2	i shall return .
2	i purchased from another well_known supplier a saturn back to wall_toilet and installed it earlier this year .
2	the soft_close never worked and toilet_seat broke within 0_months .
2	decided to get new seat from different supplier .
2	package arrived in excellent shape , and wonderfully fast .
2	now my seat is comfortable and safe .
2	i needed a replacement pair of crocs cleo sandals after someone '_s dog_chewed mine .
2	they are exactly_what i wanted and they were delivered as promised .
2	we needed a replacement for a dated mira_shower fitting and ordered this one afternoon and it arrived the next .
2	it was perfect for what we wanted and we are delighted with it .
2	as others have said , i wish that i had seen this site before ordering .
2	this is the first really bad_experience of on - line ordering for me .
2	as others , i placed an order and paid for it , but the have not goods arrived - and i needed them for a deadline .
2	as i paid by credit_card i shall go through the process of informing the credit_card company of the dispute , but it will take a long time to get my money back .
2	in addition have made a complaint to consumer_direct ( i was referred there by trading_standards ) on 00000_000000 and recommend others to do the same .
2	they suggested to me a form of words for a letter to be sent by recorded delivery .
2	the complaints are logged , so the more people who complain to them , the more likely it is that action will be taken .
2	i purchased a hoodie for my grandaughter who is petite , when the top arrived it was way too small , but she was able to return at no cost to herself , and received a larger item which fitted her perfect just a few_days_later .
2	order curtains friday recieved them on monday . great quality just put them up and they look great would recommed highly .
2	order my new mattress on the monday arrived by 00 . 00 on tuesday excellent product would recommed matttressman highly .
2	brought two floor runners and im very pleased with them .
2	the rubber backing stop '_s them moving even with two dogs running about :-) have wash one already and has washed realy well would buy from these again .
2	brought this easy leader for my dog .
2	very good product would defo recommend no more pulling .
2	service very good came within_0days :-)
2	my search for a new mattress came about as a result of a bad previous decision and a very poorly back .
2	this time i tried every bed , in every shop , at every price and then i did my internet research and was actually intrigued by a negative_review ( on another site ) which looked out of place when i found the website and read the entire thing , and got in touch with my questions .
2	the service was excellent .
2	this company is really knowledgable , really polite and really informative .
2	they recommended a mattress and i took the plunge - after all , why on earth would i buy a mattress i can test for two minutes in a shop , surrounded_by onlookers , when i could love it or return it within a month ?
2	the company called after i made my order to check that i '_d made the right_decision , they then called a few_days_later as the mattress was ready !
2	it was delivered on time , unpacked and put on the bed for me , and away we went .
2	by night 0 the backache had gone , by night 0 we were sleeping for hours at a time .
2	just to make_sure we '_ve revisited those bed shops and checked our short list again and this mattress is by far the most comfortable of all .
2	if we '_d paid three_times as much it wouldn_'_t have been this comfortable .
2	so , thanks to the negative_review ( from someone_who was unlucky_enough not to purchase from john_ryan ) i found one of the best , british made mattresses and one of the nicest , most knowledgable companies to do_business with .
2	highly_recommended to all my friends .
2	most efficient organisation , descriptions are accurate , value is good and delivery is extremely fast - couldn_'_t ask for more !
2	all previous parcels , including international ones , have been arranged online with no_problems whatsover .
2	in fact i even ' like ' them on facebook .
2	this time i got baffled , clicked on online help , and catherine not only sorted it out but sent me links to the right spot in the order process .
2	so no wrecks , just one very satisfied_customer .
2	gold_star .
2	all my shopping_experiences with viovet are fantastic , if i want just one small thing or a large order !
2	no problem too small or too large .
2	it is such a pleasure_dealing_with a company who are always polite , no matter who i speak to or contact .
2	i save so much money with them with veterinary prescriptions which is brilliant ; as that is a must with 0 dogs and four birds in today '_s economy !
2	i love my pets as much as the next person so i want the best for them .
2	dealing_with viovet is a pleasure always , i get the best service , best products and feel that i am a special customer which makes all the difference to me .
2	if i do have a problem which is a rarity then it is cleared up normally within the hour , fantastic !
2	what can i say if you have a pet and your looking for a fantastic , service , tips , products then look no further this place is the best !
2	!
2	was very impressed with the speed of delivery .
2	there is a huge_variety of items to choose from , but my son chose for 0 of his friends for his d of e . he said the food was very good plus the snacks were tasty and there were lots of useful items in there as well .
2	would use this again , highly_recommended .
2	this is the first time i have used full_circle , as i have always booked through club_med web_site before .
2	i found jacky extremely knowledgeable and helpful , she always answered my emails immediately , and i think she got us an amazing deal .
2	we have always had good service from nitrotek until we sent our rc car on 0 .
2	february for repair .
2	all thru february i kept asking when it would be ready kept getting emails saying how busy they were what a backlog they had .
2	then in march they claimed they had sent me an_email on00 february with an estimate which i had not replied to .
2	how could this be when the same week they were still telling_me that no one had looked at it yet ?
2	on 00 march i paid by paypal hoping it might be done soon .
2	gain and again i emailed no reply , tried going via their website , no reply .
2	finally i rang their sales line as there is no number for customer_services .
2	i was told the car would be repaired and sent the next_day ... the following_day we received someone_else '_s car !!
2	three_weeks_later i am still_waiting four car and presumably some poor soul is waiting for this car .
2	do not buy from notrotek , they have made my 00 year_old very unhappy .
2	first_class from_start to finish , down to placing my order and the help i received because i had made a mistake and was helped through it by your staff , to receiving the finished item which was beyond what i had expected , it was fantastic and i will recommend you to anyone and will be a great idea for a few christmas_presents next year .
2	thanks again to your team ,
2	anita pickering .
2	have been with flogas since 0000 and dealt_with the huttoft branch in lincolnshire things have gone from bad to worse . my husband has_been ill and had not checked the gas levels so we ran_out of gas 00 jan rag the huttoft number and explained the situation that my husband had been ill ( he is also disabled and cannot get around ) the man of the telephone said there was no chance of getting any gas today as he could not contact the depot as they were not answering their phone i explained this was an_emergency we had no hot_water of use of our cooker without it he said that he was sorry but he could not do anything about it .
2	this company seems to go out of the way to upset people last time we ordered gas they took our money but could not tell us when they were going to deliver as again they could not reach the depot and give us a delivery time .
2	i know the drivers have mobile_phones and carry extra cylinders on their lorries but that does not seem to matter .
2	we are not big customers have 0 - 0 cylinders a year so perhaps we do not matter ,
2	customer service is unknown to this company and after 00 years with them i have had enough .
2	we will no_longer use them and will find another_supplier
2	found a wash_basin and loo for £_00 . great value .
2	ordered one day and arrived the next . free delivery too .
2	you cannot get better_than that !
2	good quality and fantastic service would recommend this company to anybody . well_done !
2	this the first place that i look when looking for items that seem to be discontinued in the shops . no_hassle . everything sent for just one price in one package .
2	if you want to know about an item or not sure that the medication will suit you . just ask .
2	in one word brilliant !
2	bought two essentials frying_pans . bargain price !
2	good weight , heats_up extremely fast . easy to clean perfect everyday pans !
2	also bought cream enamel coffee / tea / sugar canisters again at a good price . very retro . and look good too .
2	finally silicone cooking tongs these are so easy to use !
2	delivery was spot_on . all items were delivered next_day by_fedex and were tracked all the way .
2	excellent goods . excellent service .
2	my first_port of call now for all kitchenware .
2	always very helpful .
2	items received are packaged well and there are never any quibbles about returns or exchanges and if items do need to be returned money is refunded immediately .
2	cannot_rate them high enough
2	speedy delivery of great product .
2	the best customer_services dept i have come_across , will_definately use again and will recommend to friends .
2	i ordered my appliances on thursday and they were delivered on saturday .
2	i was given a 0 hour time window and when the delivery man was running_late , he rang to inform_me .
2	he was friendly and cheerful and gave_us good advice about unpacking and inspecting the items .
2	it was also great to have 00_hours in which to fully inspect the goods , rather_than having to do so while the delivery man was present .
2	i can_honestly_say that i did not think i would be able to afford a new computer after losing my late beloved partner , but gimmitech and paybreak made this all possible for me for which i am truly_grateful .
2	both companies were very fast in dealing_with my order and finance and i would recommend them without a second thought to all my friends .
2	thank_you both for a wonderful and reliable service .
2	kind_regards
2	i was shocked when i took a parcel to the post_office and was told how much it would cost so i decided to try out hermes , i was very pleasantly_surprised to find it was half the price and i could track it '_s progress on line .
2	my recipient was thrilled with the speed too and i have used them ever_since .
2	i fell in love with braeburn fabric whe .
2	i saw it in a local fabric store but at £_00 a metre it was too expensive for me , i looked on google and just fabrics were selling the same thing for just over_£_00 but the best thing was there was a special_offer at £_00 . 00 a metre - not only that but delivery was super_fast and the material is gorgeous .
2	i was prescribed eukanuba by my vet but his price was much more than medicanimal and they even give free_p_&_p - i couldn_'_t go_wrong .
2	this costs nothing to use but you get real cash_back straight_into your bank_account .
2	there really are no strings , i couldn_'_t_believe it until i tried it and i just got £_00 back - brilliant , i am telling_everyone i know .
2	have a dog with a squeaky tummy , this is brilliant stuff and delivered super_fast by vetimed - what would i do without it and them !
2	i was pleased to find both of the products i was looking for at the best price online .
2	hi , i have a bit of girlie gossip to share with you , do check out fragrance_direct online .
2	there is so much choice i just had to tell you about it & their low_prices make shopping with them even better !
2	the home care range is great especially the reed difusers - they are so much_cheaper then in the department_stores .
2	everything comes really quickly & i have never had anything damaged or broken because they pack things so well .
2	also if they don_'_t have the perfume you want you can ask them to stock it , this may take a few_months but when they get it the price is always very good .
2	i wouldn_'_t buy my perfumes from anywhere_else .
2	i was looking for ideas for christmas_presents for my friends .
2	festive_lights had a huge_selection of beautiful garden solar_lights .
2	i bought a solar_light watering_can decorated with flowers ; a lovely present for a friend .
2	i also bought some solar_lights for my garden .
2	a present for me !
2	love the lights ; glitters during the day and so pretty at night .
2	i had to buy some more lights .
2	another present for me and for more friends !!
2	the lights were delivered on time and well_packaged .
2	thank_you for making my garden look so beautiful .
2	had a problem with delivery - parcel was to be delivered to my home address whilst i was at work .
2	emailed firstly but it was the weekend .
2	so rang on the monday and they checked and rang me back straight_away to tell me my email had been dealt_with .
2	lovely people to talk to .
2	as it happened the delivery man was in the area when he received a phone_call to change the delivery address , and my printer arrived within ten_minutes of talking to customer service !
2	brilliant result , i would have been happy with delivery the following working day .
2	really happy with my printer , and a great price too .
2	i will_definately use printerland again .
2	could not fault this company way excellent service and first thing delivery next_day
2	cannot_fault this company first_class in every_aspect if you require parts look no further than this company
2	i bought a kitchen from the meir department stoke on trent . after fitting the kitchen i found out i had to purchase the edging strip separately unfortunately the store did not have the strip and i had to order the strip directly from scotland . i was asked to pay in_advance as they could not send or order the strip for the store as it was regarded as a special order . i was charged a delivery charge which i felt was unfair as this item i feel should have been available in store . the item was to be delivered within five days but after three_weeks i am still_waiting despite a number of calls to the store . very poor customer service .
2	i ordered linking balloons in 0 colours which should have all been the same shape .
2	some were sausage shaped which i couldn_'_t use and 0 had holes in them so were useless .
2	poor and hence won_'_t be using again .
2	no problem , pump arrived on time and works , thanks !
2	ordered a sewing_machine 0 july_0000 , today , 0th_august nothing has yet appeared .
2	in the meantime , phoned , emailed and been sent up the garden path .
2	just phoned and been told that on the 0th of august it should arrive .
2	told by a bad tempered , rude person_who spoke bad french .
2	no apology from him .
2	with difficulty extracted the name of the transport people from him and date of arrival .
2	looked the transport people up in the yellow_pages ( la redoute guy had no phone number ) but they are not responding .
2	this is the last time i buy from laredoute france !
2	!
2	compare that to amazon or ebay_sellers !
2	a very comfortable stay , friendly and helpful staff , fantastic room , good price , what more could you want !
2	just ordered a voucher for birthday_present .
2	so easy to do and arrived within a couple of days .
2	hope the recipient enjoys spending the voucher at sportsbikeshop
2	just ordered some cable and rechargeable_batteries , excellent price , excellent service and excellent packaging and delivery .
2	will purchase from kenable again .
2	very fast delivery .
2	goods as_described and packaged well .
2	very clear_instructions on how to use the product .
2	staff were friendly and certainly knew their products good advice was given to me the goods i ordered were delivered promptly very good experience will certainly shop_here again
2	this service is very useful for transporting bulky items reliably from one office to a private home , i would return and do this again .
2	it was good to find a generous company that allowed me to raise money for my favourite charity via easyfundraising at the same time as provide rapidly some quality product prepared to my specific measurements .
2	it is a real_pleasure to see my fresh curtains everyday !
2	thank_you very much .
2	i got an outfit that is nice with some amazing new 00st_century textiles and with a colour coordination that is stunning to wear on my wedding_anniversary .
2	very much looking_forward to wearing it out !
2	always been very impressed with this company , thats_why i always use them , i have no_complaints about anything they '_ve done , all '_s really good . would always recommend .
2	would definetley shop with you again , whole_experience excellent , thankyou .
2	would definetly deal with this company again .
2	all of the family enjoyed these exellent steaks would definetly reccomend .
2	bought these chennille cushions , and i love them , got a great bargain in the sale . havent been disappointed with anything i '_ve bought from this company . so the future is bright for linens_limited .
2	mike came to the rescue again and sorted_out technical problem !
2	thanks again to tyres on the drive for professional service
2	like all delivery drivers , they are cheerful , pleasant and helpful .
2	such a pleasure to have contact with and so much_nicer_than shop_assistants who mostly can '_t be bothered .
2	i will always prefer to buy online due to the efficiency , fast delivery and cheerful drivers who maintain this no matter_how busy as stressful their jobs must be .
2	they are an underestimated asset as they brighten_up the day for so many people .
2	by the way , i am not married to , related to , or a friend of any delivery driver , i have just had a delivery from yodel and found the driver so cheerful that he has really brightened_up my day .
2	i am very pleased and impressed with the topper and the service .
2	i have purchased toppers before so i feel qualified to comment on this one .
2	the speed of delivery was superfast and the topper was very well_wrapped and packed , had there been any damage it would have been very easy to see before opening the inner packaging .
2	there was no smell at all once it was unpacked and having arrived fairly early in the morning i was able to lie it on top of my bed for the rest of the day .
2	early evening i put it on the bed as it was almost ready but certainly enough to sleep on .
2	by the following evening it was as it should be and very , very comfortable indeed .
2	the cover having a ‘ rough ’ surface underneath , stops it from slipping and having had it now for a week or so it has not moved at all .
2	the free pillows that came with it were a real_bonus as although i already had similar pillows they were not such good quality as these and certainly they are far more comfortable as they are a bit softer to lie on .
2	i would recommend this company highly to anyone as the service and product are exceptional .
2	there are many firms selling toppers on the internet so thank_goodness i found this one as not only is the product and service first_class , the price was very , very competitive .
2	thank_you .
2	i have only purchased a power adapter for my owl meter .
2	i placed the order and paid for it and received it within 0_days .

2	i ordered tbis system for my pregnant daughter and she_loves it .
2	i will mmore than likely make a purchase in the future and will have no_reservations on recommending precious_little one to anyone , fabulous service a **** company .

2	always packed well and with good use by dates .
2	thankyou petmeds !

2	i have bought toys for my two caique '_s ’ and they are great quality , i know they are safe for them ; they even put them in categories for the parrot ’_s size so i know they are suited for my parrots .
2	i regularly buy the food for them also ; “ harrison '_s ”, and often leave it to the last moment , but it never_fails to get here on time .

2	so i ordered an snes super scope from ebay last_week to use as a prop for a convention this coming weekend and it was dispatched quite quickly .
2	i thought " great , i should get it by friday or saturday at_least " and nothing could go_wrong right ?
2	wrong !
2	it '_s the following_monday , i '_ve been waiting for my package .... or at the very least , updates on it ... my tracking_number is p00lmbg
2	loaded_onto perth van
2	at 00 : 00 , mon , 00 sep_0000
2	delivery attempted , we will reschedule
2	00 : 00 , sat , 00 aug_0000
2	loaded_onto perth van
2	00 : 00 , sat , 00 aug_0000
2	they have attempted a delivery , whilst it was true that i was out of the house on saturday and didn_'_t come home till after 0 , why was there no calling_card left ?
2	was the parcel even delivered or did the guy just think " screw it they don_'_t really need this ".
2	and loaded_onto perth van .... why is it so hard to get it to dundee ?
2	it '_s literally the next town over , it '_s at_least a 00 minute to an hours drive and i live in a street that is really not hard to find because it '_s outside the city_centre which is small .
2	it doesn_'_t take at_least 0 hours to get it to the next city over
2	i '_m yet to contact them but when i do i will not be happy
2	next time i will pay for the shipping with royal_mail and not always go for the free shipping
2	[ update ]
2	i have contacted the customer service line and they were actually really helpful , they just had a problem with my address .
2	i provided the details and the package actually arrived whilst i was on the phone .
2	i was a bit_worried to start with as i thought " oh well i may as well start another new diet .
2	but , when the meal_packs arrived and i unpacked the boxes , i couldn_'_t_believe that all these wonderful labled dishes were for me to try .
2	then after one week i was converted .
2	this is the most easiet diet to stick to that i have ever started .
2	i shall not weigh myself until after week 0 , but i think i am slowly melting away .
2	this is the most perfect company to do_business with .
2	i placed my order for an arctic jacket on the 00th_december and it was delivered to me on the 00th_december .
2	i just cannot_fault them for their service .
2	the jacket was in perfect_condition and just as per its decription online .
2	i recommend them to everybody .
2	just read some terrible reviews for this company and i think i was reading about some other courier service .
2	i was expecting a parcel on 00 december .
2	interlink sent me a text that morning to say my parcel would be delivered between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 .
2	my parcel was delivered to me at 00 : 00 .
2	it was delivered by a very nice man who knocked at the door and wished me a good day .
2	the parcel wasn_'_t damaged in any way .
2	in fact i was absolutely_delighted with the whole courier experience as i had been previously very let_down by parcelforce .
2	when i was finally allowed to collect my parcel from their office , the staff there said they were very disappointed with their driver , which didn_'_t help me much at all !!!!
2	so , a very well_done to interlink_express .
2	thank_you very much .
2	i thought that the service and the quick delivery of my product was second to none .
2	well_done green and easy .
2	my experience with the company was good a few_years_ago and my order came quickly .
2	however , this time things were different .
2	there was no sign of the gloves i ordered for about 00 days .
2	i was sent a royal_mail tracking_number but it was not valid on the royal_mail website a week_later , so they did not appear to have been posted .
2	my email to the company was unanswered .
2	after a conversation on the phone i was told they were looking into it with royal_mail .
2	i pointed_out that the gloves were needed for a trip very soon and after more telephone_calls they agreed to send a pair but said they would cut_off the cardboard so i could get them quicker .
2	this didn_'_t sound ideal but i was assured this wouldn_'_t affect my right to return them if they didn_'_t fit .
2	they ended_up being too small and i returned them using the address and instructions on the website at the time and sending an_email to let them know .
2	over a month later i have no refund !
2	after an unanswered email and another lengthy conversation by phone i was told they hadn_'_t had them back as nothing had been logged .
2	unfortunately i did not use recorded delivery so cannot prove they were sent or received , however , it seems too much of a coincidence that royal_mail lost the both gloves originally sent and those i returned !
2	my hunch is either the company are extremely disorganised and have lost my return package , or they decided the gloves are not resaleable without the cardboard label so not to give a refund .
2	it is too easy to blame_royal_mail but i have sent and received many things before and never had a problem .
2	once when something went_astray it was returned to me , however there '_s no sign of this package .
2	i am disappointed to have lost money and would not advise others to use this company .
2	lovely , good quality products though this most definitely isn_’_t the company to use for the faint_hearted or those wanting a stress_free time !
2	the invitations were the easiest and best ordering experience but it went_downhill from there .
2	misinformation was given regarding motifs , the print colour of our order of service ’_s was wrong and then finally we received an a0 table plan when an a0 was ordered .
2	mistakes were corrected quickly , quibble - free and courteously – however there were far too many and they really shouldn ’_t have happened .
2	great products and excellent service
2	the item arrived on time as advised .
2	exactly_what i wanted and very straightforward to return .
2	will use this service again and very happy to add my personal recommendation
2	i ordered the goods and they were here even before i expected them .
2	it is really good .
2	the value for money is super as well .
2	i can really recommend jgd_crafts without_reservation
2	excellent service and excellent products
2	happy customer - get what was ordered , no_hassle , no_fuss .
2	speedy , very well_packed delivery as well as up to date text and email_updates - very impressed .
2	daughter had problems with boohoo . com do not touch at all spread the word to avoid theft by them !
2	awful service , rip_off thieves , unhelpful customer_services dept .
2	did not listen to problem , their way is right you the customer have no rights .
2	wrongly labelled ( size ) item returned and customer charged for it .
2	disgraceful response three_times from customer_services .
2	i strongly_advise everyone to avoid using this company
2	i was very pleased with the service provided and would use them again without hesitating .
2	they were there waiting to pick_up my car and waiting for me as i got back so nothing to complain_about
2	very user_friendly every_step easy would definately recommend to a friend .
2	the desktop is exactly_what i wanted , it is perfect , i only had one issue i bought a new 00 " monitor with my purchase and they probably unknowingly sent it with a 0 pin_plug , which luckily wasn_'_t an issue for me as i had an_adapter , but others may not be as fortunate .
2	they sent it on the estimated delivery date , and the desktop computer is exactly_what i wanted so no real issues with it , regarding quality it '_s perfect and couldn_'_t be better .
2	very easy to book a room at this site .
2	they were great with the follow thru info and tips for getting to the hostel .
2	it was all panic_stations unable to leave the house due to an accident the previous week .
2	i had forgotten to buy flowers for birthday the following_day .
2	i scanned florist websites for next_day delivery so late tuesday_evening ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) never thought i would find anyone , then came_across serenata_flowers . com .
2	lovely looking flower_arrangements etc , value for money and next_day delivery 00 / 00 / 00 wednesday .
2	they text me when it left the shop , then when it was delivered great .
2	i will use them again for certain .
2	thank_you , thank_you
2	brenda clarkson
2	i too wish i had read the reviews about this company before ordering .
2	ordered two items in early_december which have not arrived and i have now cancelled order following two unanswered emails .
2	i have requested immediate_refund and will use small_claims court to reclaim monies if not received .
2	sent flowers to my mum for mother '_s day .
2	they were beautiful , the service was excellent .
2	they were excellent value for money .
2	will definitely use them again
2	thank u

2	good company , the service was very straightforward .
2	didn_'_t get a massive price for my phone (£_00 ) but as they say " it '_s better_than a poke in the eye "!
2	would recomend to anyone looking a few_pounds for a phone they no_longer need :-)
2	great quality goods , expertly_packed and very quickly delivered .
2	would definitely use this company again .
2	i couldn_'_t_believe just how easy and painless this procedure was !
2	i wish i had done it sooner , the amount of money spent on contact_lenses and glasses over the years would have more than paid for the surgery .
2	everyone concerned with the procedure were so wonderfully helpful and understood all my worries by explains every_step of the way .
2	not only did my wonderful surgeon come and spend time before my op with me but my anaesthetist also did .
2	any_questions i had were answered_immediately .
2	the aftercare has_been exemplary , all appointments on time and by very professional people .
2	would definitely recommend optical_express for this operation .
2	great , caring people to deal with .
2	customer_services brilliant .
2	very helpful young_lady advised that my parcels would be delivered the following_day and to ring in the morning to obtain a time .
2	duly did and was told by another helpful lady the goods would be delivered in approx 00 minites , and they were .
2	driver very pleasant too and carried the goods in for me .
2	would recommend as they do not deserve the bad comments they have .
2	very trustworthy and brilliant way of paying anyone .
2	use this method all the time .
2	brilliant !
2	brilliant company to deal with , very helpful .
2	starting using them this year for my gardening needs .
2	very good quality and superb price plus quick delivery .
2	will_continue to buy goods from them .
2	harrison from dialaflight arranged our flights and car_hire for our recent_trip to the usa .
2	he sorted everything in one phone_call .
2	the flights and connections the car_hire and kept it all within a budget we were happy with .
2	close to the departure date i needed to check some details and there was always someone available to help me .
2	an_email was sent to me shortly before we travelled making_sure we knew what to do and checking that we each had and esta for entry into the usa .
2	i would contact dialaflight the next time i need a holiday arranging .
2	excellent - great products and superfast delivery - highly_recommend

2	great trampoline - very quick delivery - great price
2	picked_up quickly , flexible with drop_off .
2	good communications .
2	extremely reasonable_prices .
2	faultless service !
2	very pleased .
2	i would certainly add this company to my list of outdoor websites as they are brilliantly organised and know their stuff .
2	they deliver exceedingly quickly .
2	i have also found them to be the cheapest place to buy some brands and items
2	i had ordered a cymbal and asked for delivery to work as there would always be someone to sign for it .
2	but the tracking was great - told me within the hour when it was arriving and allowed me to have the option to leave with a neighbour .
2	i will use them again !
2	really easy website and very quick delivery which is free as are any returns should the need_arise .

2	the whole set_up was easy and simple to use .

2	i will recommend globalwebpay to everyone i know .
2	the instruction on how to sell our phones was very clear and easy to follow - the reply came quickly in the post , everything was dealt_with quickly and efficiently .
2	the delivery man rang my doorbell and then gave a knock on the door .
2	not the usual continuous banging you get from some of them .
2	the delivery was very fast and the man was friendly .
2	some curriers practically throw the parcels at you and then hurry off but not this man , he made sure i got the parcel in my house ok and commented on the traffic in the street ( building site over the road and road surfacing being done so lots of delivery wagons .
2	i purchased some drontal_plus tablets for my dogs from petmeds on one of their free_postage days ( to test their performance before i ordered anything expensive ).
2	the price was the cheapest i could find and with free_postage that made it a double bargain .
2	i could pay by paypal so no_worries_about giving card_details to an online stranger and the tablets arrived the next_day .
2	i would definately recommend them and will be ordering from petmeds again ( after looking around and comparing_prices of course )
2	hope this review will be helpful to you

2	but my worries were unfounded .

2	it also saves entering in my details every time .
2	ordered a special custom club over the bank_holiday_weekend .
2	expected to wait 0_weeks or so , but it came on the next friday !
2	have used them before for custom clubs and service is always good .
2	fast dispatch of your meds , friendly and helpful pharmacy service .
2	i have been using this company for a few_years_now and they remain consistantly good .
2	this was the first time i have had the need to use a courier parcel collection service , and having_searched online , interparcel gave the cheapest quote .
2	they were brilliant .
2	the parcel was collected at 0 a . m . on the requested day and i received it in the morning of the following_day .
2	i had thought it would take three or four days as quoted , so was delighted at the speedy service .
2	would definitely use them again if the need_arose .
2	many_thanks .
2	one year later , two lost houses later , £££ in wasted phone_calls and recorded delivery costs the underwriter finally contacted me yesterday to tell me the decision in principle issued by hsbc was wrong ( delivered in a manner suggesting this error is somehow my fault ) all couched in extremely xenophobic terms .
2	if your name sounds ' foreign ' ( their words , not mine ) walk_away .
2	now , i '_m told my original documents are lost by the bank ( again as though this is somehow my fault ).
2	the bank will abuse you in every way possible save for actual physical assault .
2	for goodness_sake , don_'_t waste your time , energy and goodwill .
2	banks are bad , but not this bad .
2	we were only applying for 00_% ltv as premier customers and still untold misery ensued ..... oh and by the way , don_'_t bother_writing to the md / ceo as his department doesn_'_t bother responding to correspondence .
2	is first direct really a subsidiary of hsbc ?
2	how can it be any better .
2	notwithstanding those rave_reviews and tempting switching fees , i will never touch an hsbc related company again .
2	if there was a zero star option that would have been generous .
2	i ordered 0 pairs of merrell_shoes for my elderly parent and having bought this brand regularly for years i had no reason to believe there would be any issue with the size .
2	when the shoes arrived , one pair looked worn with the elastic side strap already lose and stretched and the boots were designed so badly the angle at the ankle made it impossible to fit the foot into the boot .
2	considering the boots are advertised as " slip on and off " this defect was unacceptable .
2	the shoes were advertised as new and in perfect_condition .
2	i immediately notified outdoor_kit within 00_minutes of receiving the shoes .
2	i am shocked at the response from this company which is attempting to deprive me of my statutory_rights .
2	having taken a great deal of time and effort , to clarify the defects in detail which could cause a serious injury to my elderly parent , i received an_email_confirming the order would be refunded when the goods were returned .
2	the return_label emailed following repeated requests was actually the label used to post the goods to me .
2	i then received another email_stating the refund would only be processed if there is a defect with the size of the shoes reneging on the earlier agreement .
2	in the meantime , i still_haven_'_t received a valid return_label .
2	it has_been an aggravating experience which is far from over .
2	i regularly buy goods online but i can state with some certainty this is not a company i would trust again .
2	very unprofesssional company run by a person_who will quite happily make arrangements and subsequently hang up the phone and fail to attend appointments without reason .
2	dealing_with cookersolutions wasted a lot of my time and effort and my cooker in the meantime is still not working .
2	don_'_t waste your time on this company .
2	it seems amazing a company as large and established as pixmania could have such draconian processes .
2	more than 00 days after_placing an order it still_hasn_'_t arrived yet i have been charged_twice for the same item .
2	trying to resolve even simple matters by email is impossible as the staff are determined to misunderstand every communication and when calling the company i was cross examined about my personal_circumstances by a barely litterate undereducated rude adolescent .
2	low quality service by undertrained staff .
2	this is only my second order from pixmania and i won_'_t be making any more purchases with this company .
2	having spent hours surfing the internet for the right watch at the most competitive price i ordered a rotary sterling_silver watch from the watch_hut .
2	the order was confirmed and payment taken .
2	at that stage the watch was also available at other_outlets for the same price .
2	later the following_day i received an_email from the watch_hut telling_me the watch would not be supplied having been_discontinued by rotary .
2	i contacted rotary and discovered the watch is still available as a current line item .
2	the watch_hut simply shrugged off its lie telling_me this is the standard response in such circumstances .
2	of course , by now the other_outlets had sold the watch .
2	i even tried reporting the problem to rotary without effect .
2	apparently rotary is happy for its authorised distributors to use its brand to lure customers with non - existent products .
2	my advice ?
2	buy a different brand from another shop .
2	a first_rate hassle_free experience .
2	0_stars
2	will definitely use simply_games again .
2	faultless service .
2	just as well i had not ordered anything important , ordered on 00 , supposedly sent on the 00th but as of 00th it has still not arrived .
2	i was told as it was sent second class i should give it another week before i email them again .
2	i am well versed in royal_mail 0nd_class_post , i sent several items to customers .
2	generally they arrive two_days_later and at a push three .
2	i think it is sloppy customer service to just blame_royal_mail .
2	pharmacy_0u charge £ 0 . 00 for second class_post whilst the actual cost is £ 0 . 00 .
2	very polite , helpful and waited in seconds for my answer which info was spot_on
2	thanks sammie , your a star and you saved me money
2	i ordered two bottles of perfume .
2	they were dispached next_day , well_packaged and arrived quickly in perfect_condition .
2	p_&_p was reasonable and it was much_cheaper_than going to the shops .
2	the prices offered are very competitive but items they claim are in stock take a long time to arrive - fine as long as you are aware of this beforehand .
2	all my orders have had a delay of some sort .
2	i cancelled one of my orders after it did not arrive before it was needed despite_being advised that they would make it a priority order .
2	00 days_later , many phone_calls with long waiting times and many emails , i still have not received any refund and am told it may be at_least another 00 days .
2	i am getting quite concerned - the customer service officials are polite but can offer no assistance of any kind .
2	they just offered to email on my behalf .
2	please_beware - i do believe i will eventually be refunded but connstant checking / ringing and emailing with no response is very frustrating .
2	i have had bariatric surgery and depend_on an excellent protein_powder as part of my daily nutritional_needs .
2	i have always been able to get what i want when i need it from this company and i have referred several friends and family_members .
2	thank_you !
2	the complexities of all the annuity options_available were not only very clearly expained by my contact , steve_craven , he took time to understand my financial requirements and objectives in retirement to assist me in making my choice .
2	the process itself was made very easy , particularly helpful in indicating which forms , and sections of forms , had to be completed .
2	altogether a very friendly and professional service .
2	i have been using parcel0go for about a year now using either my hermes or tnt depending_on the length of the item i wish to send .
2	in all this time i have never had a problem with either collection or delivery and have also had my hermes pick_up from another address and bring it to me .
2	all in all an excellent service and i would highly_recomend them to anyone .
2	also twice_now i have had a problem my end and the team at parcel0go have sorted it out within minutes for me .
2	was very pleased at the speedy delivery for my items .
2	i cannot_fault oakfurnitureland .
2	in fact i wrote to the store last_week praising them .
2	i ordered a coffee_table on the saturday_morning , received an_email by the time i got home , had it delivered by wednesday .
2	everyone was great , fingers on the pulse .
2	don_'_t think i '_ve ever had better service .
2	ten out of ten .
2	would recommend to everyone .
2	orders flowers to go to spain arrived in time and were gorgeous .
2	would recommend .
2	i searched all over the web to find davinci syrups for my lattes , and supplementwarehouse . com was by far the least expensive with the best selection and the lowest shipping_costs .
2	at other_sites , i was paying as much for shipping as i would pay for each bottle , but supplementwarehouse . com was much less for both .
2	i will definitely buy from supplementwarehouse . com again .
2	would thoroughly_recommend this company .
2	the service we received could not have been better .
2	we had same day delivery and good value for money .
2	will certainly use this company again whenever we need new white goods .
2	0 parcels expected this morning .
2	0 parcel came around 00 . 00hrs .
2	i told the driver that there should be 0 parcels but he was adament there was only 0 , even_though the box said 0 of 0 .
2	later in the afternoon i received a text which said my parcel would be delivered between 00 . 00hrs and 00 . 00hrs .
2	we sat in and waited and no parcel arrived .
2	tried to ring to find out what had happened but the number given was automated and kept telling_me the parcel had been delivered and signed for at 00 . 00hrs .
2	at 00 . 00hrs i received an_email to say " tried to deliver your order from scan computers however no one available to accept delivery ".
2	how ridiculous , we were home all day waiting , have 0 dogs who bark loudly when anyone comes through the front_gate so there is no way we would miss anyone calling at our house .
2	therefore we have the case for the computer but no parts to put in it and had arranged for someone to come this evening to put it together .
2	very disappointed indeed at this bad service and what a wasted day considering it is so near christmas and we could have spent our time getting the bits of shopping .. the driver obviously went home early or couldn_'_t be bothered to do all his deliveried .
2	marvin and team were great , helped a thicko like me with great patience , in the end i felt positively clever .
2	always surprised at the quality of the goods and the up to date styles .
2	everyone comments on what i '_m wearing and can '_t_believe_how much i paid .
2	keep_up the good work .
2	everything i '_ve had from the site has_been fantastic .
2	people at work comment on what i '_m wearing .
2	when i say how much it cost and where i got it from they ask ' are they secondhand ?'
2	obviously can '_t_believe they are that cheap .
2	love the site , prefer it now to shopping on the high_street .
2	we chose key_retirement_solutions because of the number of awards won by the company , and because which magazine voted them the best equity_release company .
2	the only_disappointment we had was the amount of money we were able to release , but this was because of the age of the younger of the two of us , and a report from the gp which didn_'_t show the full nature of my husband '_s illness .
2	geoff , who saw us through the whole_process was very helpful and reassuring .
2	he sorted_out any little problems , and we felt he had our best_interests in mind the whole time .
2	brilliant service , kept me well updated .
2	free delivery is fantastic and the shoes were delivered only two_days after ordering at the weekend .
2	fabulous !
2	the items i have ordered from selections arrived very quickly and very well_packaged .
2	on one occasion i had cause to contact the company and received instant feedback from them - very impressive
2	i used to spend hours trawling websites looking for bargain breaks but with dealchecker you have regular_updates on what is available and it takes all the strain and hassle from you .
2	it also means you can have little extra breaks because sometimes you see a break that is so cheap you just gotta have it !
2	less time spent looking - more time and money to enjoy the brilliant offers that dealchecker brings .
2	the customer service was very friendly , helpful and fast .
2	fantastic on price and delivery next_day !
2	i will use printerland again and again !
2	i knew that the birthday was looming but , you know how it goes , suddenly the day was upon me and i hadn_'_t arranged anything !
2	iflorist to the rescue !
2	great flowers , fabulous price and same day delivery !
2	thanks iflorist - you saved the day and made someone very happy too !
2	i looked online and compared prices to other_sites and stores and appliance direct was far cheaper by far ,
2	i ordered my hotpoint_fridge and hotpoint dishwasher on a monday had next_day delivery but arrived on the wednesday as i ordered after 0pm on monday .
2	i received a phone_call from driver and emails_keeping_me up to date on the delivery of my appliance '_s i was given a 0hr time_slot between 0 / 0pm and arrived on time , the delivery drivers were friendly & polite ,
2	i would defiantly recommend appliance direct for excellent service and cheap prices , i saved a total £_000 by buying from appliance direct .
2	i ordered my duel_fuel cooker and in 0days it arrived i wanted to have it installed with ao . com and the only_thing that let it down was the fact that they couldn_'_t connect it in my area !
2	!
2	i was disappointed and a little annoyed but i found some one that charged me £_00 less_than ao . com if they had of fitted it for me ...
2	but apart_from that i was delighted with my purchase delivery slot and service ..
2	this is the second time i have used_resorthoppa and would definitely recommend them .
2	the bus was waiting when we arrived at alicante and picked us up at the hotel on time .
2	the service is spot_on and the price cannot be_beaten .
2	its good to be able to get all of the things you need in one place , the staff are so helpful , even bringing forward an auto_dispatch item so that the customer does not run_out of it
2	this is the second time i have used mattressman .
2	this time i bought online rather_than from the store and the site was easy to use .
2	i was able to have the delivery when i wanted it , the 0 hour_slot helped_me to plan and the guys were great - my central_london flat is in the middle of lots of building development and they had a very short time_slot to reverse into the site , get the bed and mattress out of the van , up some stairs , into a lift , 00 floors to the flat , and then remove the old mattress via the same process in reverse .
2	they were cheerful and efficient throughout .... well_done .
2	oh and the bed is quite good :)
2	i have used the service many_times since mid 0000 to ship paintings worldwide ( which i pack and insure myself separately ).
2	parcel0go '_s service is quick efficient and i particularly_like the ability to have a live_chat when i have a non standard requirement .
2	today i spoke to daniel with the problem that i was arranging a parcel to be collected from a remote site which closed for lunch and he arranged for a message to be sent to the courier requesting that collection happened during the opening_hours .
2	very helpful !
2	hopefully the courier will match this level of service !!
2	!
2	bigdug was recommended by a friend for shelving in a new garage and a workshop .
2	easy to use ordering , good email information provided and delivery arrived next_day .
2	0 shelves arrived damaged but a call to a helpful customer_services department resulted_in replacements arriving the next_day .
2	the shelves were easy to put_together and are as strong as_described .
2	teeny_tiny points to note
2	- the price on the website changed whilst we were ordering causing consternation .... then we realised that the vat had been added in !!
2	!
2	- £_00 delivery felt like a lot ... but the product was reasonable so we swallowed it and went_ahead .
2	double 0 are a reliable company that deliver what they say .
2	we have always obtained great seats for the concerts booked and will_continue to use the company .
2	tickets are always delivered on time and the process is hassle_free .
2	i placed an order customer number 0000000000 order delivery enquiry 000000000 and i received a confirmation for my order but did not receive my items and my order disappeared from the site !
2	i contacted customer_services who promised to resend my order , then nothing
2	i contacted customer_services again & this time my order was sent out but i had an e_- mail saying i had set_up a credit account when i hadn_'_t but this is ok if i get my order at the original price charged ie £ 0 not full price without the discount accepted on my original order !
2	i need a response to my e_-_mails as i will keep the credit account and order again in the future if i am only charged the original amount of my order ie £ 0 otherwise i will have to return my order and close my account and not order ever again , thank_you !
2	i like the prices of the items but i still expect to get the item pictured & the boots i were sent were a good 0 - 0 inches shorter_than in the picture of the item onsite !!
2	!
2	the 0nd_pair i ordered killed my feet on the first time of wearing them and so are useless to me now too as are not just extremely uncomfortable , not true to size and they left me with numerous blisters !
2	!
2	i expect the items i purchase to be functional and fit for purpose as well as the actual item sent as in the picture not shorter boots which they definitely were
2	i am not a happy customer & if this is not resolved in a satisfactory way i will be going to trading_standards with my complaint as the boots were not just useless but not as shown on site either and the other ones left scars on my feet :-(
2	( p . s i do not see why i have to pay for return postage and nothing was said in regards to the other pair which are useless and unwearable and neither of the issues are my fault as i bought them both in good faith !! )
2	was horrified to find that two payments had been taken for my recent order to hungry_house , now yes e_- mail of apology sent to me explaining it would be back in my account in 0 working_days but i am on income support & on a very limited_budget so to treat_myself to a take away is a rarity and of real importance to me as in quality of food and service as i don_'_t have money to waste !!!
2	!
2	the meal itself was dire , i had to wait nearly 0 hours for it and it was cold on arrival & the delivery driver had a car parked_outside my door with around 0 other guys in it at 0am with me in my nightclothes & i felt very uncomfortable & find this to be extremely unprofessional plus like i said the food was dire anyway but my issue is the extra £_00 . 00 which was taken from my account was actually for my electricity for over the weekend !!!!!!!!
2	!
2	so to find that money gone from my account meant i had no money for my electricity for over the weekend and my electricity ran_out this morning ( i had used the emergency credit ) so i was panicking of course and i cannot even describe the hassle i went through to borrow money to put on my meter and actually spent my saturday_afternoon in tears thanks to hungry_house and it is not just about an e_- mail of apology and a refund of my money in 0 working_days as it is of no use to me when it was my money for my electricity for over the weekend !
2	:-(
2	i have decided i want nothing more whatsoever to do with your company & you can keep my money i am so appalled with your company that it is worth it just to get_rid of you and the stress caused out of my life , so pocket the money & i hope you do well with it & all the best for the future for you and your staff !
2	:-) x
2	( please_note i do not want my money back , i do not want a refund - i am so disgusted with your company & what they have done today that you can keep it , thank_you !! )
2	i ordered at 0pm yesterday_afternoon and i was woken by the postman this morning with my euros !
2	best rate , easy ordering process and amazing service .
2	i will certainly use you again and recommend you to all my friends .
2	so much_better_than queueing for hours in the post_office !
2	where is my gift voucher ?
2	!
2	normally buy the ear cleanser from the vets but with 0 dogs and at £_00 a bottle it is quite_costly .
2	the breeder of our 0nd pup told us about this site and we got 0 bottles for £ 0 more that the cost of 0 bottle from the vets .
2	came within 0_days , fantastic service .
2	will deffo be using again .
2	not used this site before and found it through a google_search as wanted to send some flowers to my sister .
2	i received a text_confirming the order and a text when they '_d been delivered then i got a text from my sister saying they were gorgeous .
2	great service and would highly_recommend .
2	reasonably_priced too .
2	ordered my new canon 000mm macro lens on the monday and did a bank_transfer of the funds during monday_night to save a further 0 % on the already outstanding price .
2	received an_email the following_morning to say my funds and been received , then a further mail to advise it was being shipped .
2	item came before_lunch yesterday .
2	a fantastic service where i was updated every_step of the way and saved over_£_000 on jessops and other stores prices .
2	well happy :)
2	i have used aria technology to supply computer parts for many_years and they have always proved very reliable .
2	on a few occasions their courier has let them down but in the past year with a new courier service it has_been a great improvement , especially with text_messages to tell you the approximate delivery time .
2	i started to build computers as a hobby for friends and family , but in the last_year have set_up my own computer business , repairing and building computers for customers .
2	i seldom have any_problems with components but when i do aria are very good at replacing them .
2	i ordered a yamaha digital_piano on line , together with pedals and bench seat .
2	estimated delivery date was wed .
2	i changed to thurs .
2	i received order confirmation but no further emails .
2	i checked my order on the wed only to find the delivery date had been put back 0_days with no notification .
2	i telephoned customer_services to be told that the bench seat was out of stock because i changed the delivery date and so nothing was being delivered .
2	why no email , i would have settled for the piano and pedals and waited for the bench to be delivered at a later date .
2	customer_services offered delivery of piano 0_days hence ( estimated ) no good as i work .
2	if i had been informed immediately i would have arranged for delivery on my next_day off but as they did not seem too worried that no emails had been received informing_me what was happening i just cancelled the order
2	very poor communication , and do not appreciate that some people order on line and arrange delivery dates because their free time is limited !
2	my initial_enquiries by emails about a pair of swarovision binoculars were responded to swiftly .
2	the tone of messages was friendly and helpful .
2	the 0 %_discount using direct bank_transfer meant a significant_saving .
2	i ordered on tuesday and the item arrived via ups on friday , within the timescale of 0 - 0_days delivery specified on the website .
2	a positive_experience which should be the case when an expensive item is purchased online .
2	very fast reply to a query .
2	item arrived day after order .
2	brass handles of a very good quality - most pleased with them .
2	would buy from them again .
2	plumbnation is one of the most efficient company i have used via online shopping .
2	staff were courteous , helpful and friendly .
2	response by phone and email were rapid .
2	i asked for an earlier delivery which was sorted_out very quickly .
2	a company to be recommended for the high_standard of service and very competitive price .
2	thank_you .
2	i had an e_- mail informing_me my delivery was up for collection .
2	unfortunately i wouldn_'_t be home .
2	so i went on to live_chat and was dealt_with really quickly by the very helpful richard_mileham .
2	bought an adaptil_diffuser for my dog as a few_months_ago we sadly lost our other dog .
2	these 0 dogs had spent over 00 years together and now quincy is finding it very hard to settle .
2	when he is left for even a few_minutes , he howls and barks .
2	our neighbour has reported to us he does it constantly !
2	he has started tp pee on floor and worse !
2	we have tried " doggy cds " thunder shirt , rescue remedy in his water , pet calms .
2	our voice recordings . we are at our wits_end knowing our poor dog is so anxious .
2	we plugged this in the minute it arrived and he has calmed_down !
2	we were even able to attend a family party the other evening for a couple of hours !!
2	we came back to no mess and he seemed quite relaxed .
2	going to keep it in for a bit longer and see if once he gets used to be relaxed he may learn to stay calm .
2	we hope so as he is such a lovely boy and it '_s upsetting all_round .
2	but so far so good ..
2	.
2	excellent service at a really good price
2	delivered faster_than_expected , glasses good fit and great price .
2	no_issues whatsoever with the whole_process and would definitely recommend them and would use them again myself without_hesitation .
2	i keep buying from brandoso - and keep looking - because the quality of its shoes and boots are fantastic .
2	and the speed of delivery astounds me .
2	i love it .
2	i bought a samsung laptop which arrived yesterday .
2	it will not connect to the internet .
2	after hours on the phone , being pushed from_pillar to post , calls not being returned , it was finally agreed that the laptop was faulty .
2	misco then refused to take it without an authorisation from samsung ( which i had and which i gave them ) - even_though under the sale of goods_act the product is their responsibility - and put the phone down on me .
2	customer_services do not know anything about consumer_law .
2	i have spent £_000 and received nothing .
2	terrible service with no apology at any stage .
2	initially the wrong order was sent - but the store could not have been more helpful in sorting things out and in providing compensation .
2	fantastic service and i will be back to shop with you .
2	ordered a pair of biom shoes first time and have been so impressed with speed of service and the price !
2	!
2	we have been buying dog_food from viovet the last 0 years .
2	the service has always been excellent and very speedy .
2	staff very helpful and polite .
2	product prices good too .
2	will certainly recommend !

2	competitive_pricing and loads of choice .
2	i have used serenata time and time again and thought i would carry on doing so , until this mothers_day when i ordered 0 lots of flowers for delivery on the saturday .

2	i have since been informed that the roses where nearly open and had lost petals .

2	couldn_'_t have been more helpful at the local shop , even_though we ordered on line
2	good choice of products and good quality and value
2	having been trying to resolve a claim for the last 0_weeks and getting_nowhere sarah on live_chat saved the day !
2	i was just about to close my account and give up and she sorted the issue out very satisfactorily , thanks sarah you are a star : 0 )
2	good service and great range of products .
2	you really find out about a company when there are problems and cult_pens have been utterly terrific .
2	the pen i ordered was faulty and they acted promptly and efficiently to sort_out the issue .
2	everyone was helpful , courteous and generous .
2	it '_s really refreshing to find a team who care about setting things right .
2	i can '_t recommend them more highly ; i '_ll never go_anywhere_else for writing gear .

2	boiler and accessories arrived promptly , as promised , and at the best price i could find by far .
2	really impressed .
2	as above will use again
2	we had an incredibly good value holiday in the algarve .
2	when we booked it there was a slight_hiccup on the booking site - not at dealchecker - and i had to speak to an agent .
2	she said the deal was the best she '_d ever_seen in her twenty year career ! the hotel was superb and we still_haven_'_t got over what a great deal we got .
2	would definitely use dealchecker again & again ....
2	needed a spare_key for our tow_bar . and on googling found this site ... really happy with price .. not so happy with postage .
2	it was 0 . 00 for a small 0st_class stamp and a ain white envelope , nearly as much as the key !
2	0st_class prices
2	0st_class service
2	0st_class delivery
2	this is the only online comapny i deal with now !
2	use them and you will see why ... customer service as it should be 0st_class .
2	no waiting in all day for delivery @ £_00 ... theirs is free and with a 0_hr time_slot ... other company '_s should take_note .
2	cheapest prices and great service ... you have your business plan spot_on ... well_done
2	why would anyone pay full price from petshops when you can buy direct ... delivered to your door and at a fraction of the cost
2	did internet order ... then changed my mind ... then had to add something i had forgotten ... then cancelled something ... poor people ... their service and refund were first_class
2	yes £ 0000 back in 0 years ... what ever i buy in the internet ... be it electrical or insurance ... i always check through_quidco first
2	emailed me to inform_me my tickets were being dispatched one day , received them within 00_hours .
2	no problem , great communication and great service .
2	many thanx
2	friendly service , perfect communicaton .
2	we ordered the samsung clp 000 colour laser_printer .
2	the service from printerland was excellent , the printer was delivered the next working day .
2	to sum up they have a good website and offered great service .
2	so far the samsung laser_printer ordered seems good .
2	excellent printing speed and excellent quality printing .
2	the only_negative_point is the alarming speed at which we used up the toners supplied with the printer .
2	we are now ordering the high capacity cartridges and will see how long they last
2	my contact was lee .
2	firstly i bought a pair of focal cms00 studio monitors at a price which was £_00 cheaper_than_anywhere_else i could find .
2	a couple of days_later i rang lee again to ask about a sub - woofer , i could not afford the matching focal sub so asked lee for advice on alternatives .
2	he made some calls and got back to me with a price on the focal cms sub woofer which was £_000 less_than everyone else .
2	there was no_pressure from lee but it was an offer too good to miss .
2	what can i say , music_matter were fabulous and lee was terrific .
2	i have purchased from golfbase before so i was aware of their top_class service .
2	the items i bought were keenly_priced and were delivered very quickly .
2	pc_specialist was recommended to me by a good friend who purchased a desktop_pc a couple of years_ago and was able to give me the benefit of his experience with pc_specialist .
2	my son andrew knows quite a bit about computers , unlike my self , and when i told him i wished to buy a good laptop for his mother '_s 00th_birthday he also recommended pc_specialist .
2	andrew was able to sit with me and together we agreed a specification for the laptop .
2	the whole_experience to date with pc_specialist has_been very positive .
2	the information provided on the website during the build process , the quality of the e_- mail communication and the speedy and accurate delivery have all been first_class .
2	i hope i don_'_t have the need to contact pc_specialist with problems in the future , but if i do , i am confident that the firm will do all they can to help .
2	excellent quality and service .
2	would strongly_recommend
2	excellent , friendly service .
2	ordered a road play_mat on monday arrived friday .
2	children at the pre_- school really like it .
2	now ordering the farm mat .
2	i '_ve_used this site several_times_now over the last_year and recommended it to numerous friends , all of whom have had the same successful transaction and satisfactory result .
2	great exchange_rates , easy to use website , professional service , great communications , all add up to the perfect addition to holiday preparations .
2	will not use high_street bank / exchange office again , as long as travel_fx keep going .
2	had a very urgent parcel to be collected and they give a time_slot of between 0 . 00am to 00 . 00_hours .
2	i received a text from them to say it would be collected before 00 . 00 but needless to say they never turned_up .
2	you can '_t ring them so have to just use ' chat ' and all they do is rebook for the following_day , which is what we have done .
2	they still_haven_'_t collected the parcel and i have now stayed in for two whole days which has cost money .
2	will now have to pay someone_else to deliver the goods , probably hermes as they are supposed to be good .
2	would never use this company again and wouldnt trust them to deliver the parcel let_alone pick it up !!!!!
2	i put them on a par with citylink who very kindly lost a £_000 caravan awning !!!!
2	!
2	two boxes collected from a address in bolton ( caravan awning brand_new )
2	only one containing the poles delivered the box with the awning is missing , value £_000
2	still_awaiting a report , the courier in question is citylink .
2	i am an_avid user of alacer corp - calorie - free electromix .
2	you can not buy it in stores , so i am always looking for the best deal .
2	tonight i found it !
2	provided a very rare book at a good price .
2	it arrived right on time
2	so fast to help and please .
2	i had argos_vouchers such a big help with my xmas shopping .
2	did not have any worry '_s .
2	mazuma for me from now on .
2	the bottle i ordered arrived very quickly and was beautifully_wrapped in
2	bubble_wrap - quick and efficient service will buy from them again
2	excellent service and very quick delivery .
2	i will be purchasing again from this company .
2	my parcel was delivered at the time it was stated , the delivery driver was very pleasant .
2	this is the first time i have bought anything from petfleas but it will not be the last .
2	the service and delivery is excellent and the price of the frontline i purchased is a lot_cheaper_than the vet for my jack_russell .
2	i always get good value for money and free delivery from pet_supermarket , its great .
2	i would reccommend to everyone .
2	i received excellent service in my recent_purchase of james_wellbeloved puppy_food .
2	the delivery was superb .
2	i will be buying more from medicanimal in the future .
2	ordered many_times from animed .
2	even_though transaction is made online , there is a feeling that the people behind animed cares_about what they are selling and helping_us find the right product .
2	price is good and competitive , and really appreciate free shipping so they are the only online vet retailer i will go back to .
2	some work can be done on website though , check out is sometimes tricky ; when i click out of checkout to find another product i need my basket look empty !
2	have to click onto homepage then go back to check my basket again then i can see the products i picked .
2	can be daunting on new customers , so best to look into any glitches and not get complacent .
2	i have always used collectplus to send returned items back , never an issue .
2	decided to try them for delivering an item to customer ; my delivery reach my customer within 0_days .
2	well pleased .
2	hope collectplus will keep and maintain their service as i will definitely use them again .
2	product was best price here and arrived within a few_days of order .
2	the company kept me informed of progress and delivery by email which was really useful .
2	i would definitely use them again .
2	i bought a wedding_ring from diamond_geezer , i was initially a little_concerned with buying online , but the experience was a very positive one with help easily obtainable & a returns_policy if required .
2	i was unable to purchase my chosen style from a high_street jeweller unless i had it custom_made but with diamond_geezer there was a wealth of choice to suit all needs .
2	they always have great offers and booking is painless .
2	customer service is also good , though once booked , the hard_work is being done by the company you book with .
2	we stayed at the kresten royal at rhodes for a week in early june_0000 and had a fab time .
2	the hotel is very nice , it has have 0 swimming pools , both with bars .
2	one of them only serves drinks , the other serves food as well .
2	the one nearer the sea is large and has varying depth , the smaller one nearer the reception is about 0 . 0m deep all around .
2	both have crystal_clear waters .
2	we stayed in a superior sea - view room , which was very large , very spacious , big balcony too .
2	comfy bed , the bath had jacuzzi in it with quite powerful jets as well .
2	we had the ' all_inclusive ' deal , which was really worth it .
2	it really means all_inclusive , drinks as well ( perhaps not alcohol , but we don_’_t drink alcohol anyway ), and hot food is served in one restaurant or another almost all day long .
2	the hotel has 0 restaurants , the main one always serves buffet style food with wide and varied_selection .
2	i actually prefer this style as_opposed to having to sit_down and wait to be served .
2	there is an italian_restaurant and a greek one as well .
2	in the ' all_inclusive ' deal you can opt to go one evening to the italian and one evening to the greek for ‘ free ’.
2	the hotel does not have a sandy beach , but it does have a little cove where they put out sun_beds and there is a changing cubicle .
2	otherwise there is an area cut through the rocks that leads to flat rocks where you can jump into the sea safely .
2	again sunbeds were provided here as well .
2	as i am a keen snorkeler , i find rocks and some wild life more interesting than a flat sandy beach so i was happy with this .
2	the holiday rep , mark , was very friendly and knowledgeable , nothing was too much_trouble .
2	the staff was also friendly , especially agnieszka at reception , who was very helpful .
2	again , nothing was too much_trouble .
2	the hotel is near rhodes town , only 00_minutes on public_transport .
2	well_worth the visit .
2	few things that could perhaps be improved_upon :
2	0 .
2	no wi_-_fi in the room , but there is ethernet .
2	fortunately i always have an ethernet cable with me when i travel .
2	0 .
2	the large , spacious_rooms were quite sparse , a bit soulless and they also echoed a lot .
2	perhaps some rugs , maybe pictures or something ….
2	0 .
2	for some reason you do not get foam bath or bath salts , only shower_gel and shampoo .
2	bit surprising for a 0_star hotel .
2	0 .
2	tv was pretty small for the size of the room and the sounds was so faint that we could hardly hear it .
2	you get only cnn and bbc world news in english .
2	not a huge issue … one does not go on holiday to a sun - drenched country to watch tv .
2	having said all that , we had a really good time , enjoyed it very much .
2	the points above did not bother us at all .
2	we can thoroughly_recommend the place .
2	i was worried_about something and asked a question via the web_site .
2	i received a prompt and courteous response , but also pointing it out that the answer was on the web_site .
2	it must be boring / annoying for them to have to respond to questions that have answers in their faq .
2	still , they were polite :-) .
2	my order arrived in record_time .
2	great fun .
2	reasonable_prices , smooth_transaction .
2	no_issues .
2	i bought it for a more_expensive hansgrohe shower_head set as they discontinued this line ( and the one i did find that may have fitted were very expensive ).
2	the tube diameter was 00mm , so i thought i '_ll chance it .
2	at this price , even if it did not , it would not have been too bad .
2	but it did fit after a little fiddling and was very snug .
2	it would not be much good if you frequently needed to adjust the shower_head up or down , but if it can stay mainly in one position , it '_s perfect .
2	item arrived very quickly , well_packed , and met my quality requirements .
2	the gun case was as i hoped , and it was packed very securely in bubble_wrap and corrugated cardboard , so arrived in perfect_condition .
2	i visited a store in brecon at the weekend and was impressed by the competent staff and good range of products .
2	i anticipate that the online experience will be just as positive .
2	i booked 0_months_ago for my parents and myself and husband to travel to rome in june_0000 .
2	unfortunately my father has_become too ill to travel .
2	i contacted expedia and they said they could refund all the hotel costs but only a portion of the flights and they quoted an amount i would be refunded .
2	on the strength of that , i gave my parents their money back .
2	after waiting 00 weeks not for the refund , and after emailing them for the 00th time to find out what is going on , i just received an_email_saying they are only refunding a quarter of what they quoted .
2	now i certainly can '_t go to my parents and say they owe me hundreds of pounds .....
2	i can '_t afford to carry the cost as my husband is battling cancer and doesn_'_t work .
2	i have two jobs to try and make ends_meet .
2	do you think expedia care ????
2	?
2	no !!!!!!!!
2	!
2	i am so angry and frustrated by this company but there doesn_'_t seem to be anyone who will take_responsibility for this .
2	so many bad_reviews but they continue to rip us off .
2	is there a governing body that can look into this ?
2	:' o (
2	i have forwarded my complaint to an ombudsman and a travel watch organisation , so fingers_crossed they can help .
2	we purchased the veloped recently for my husband who_suffers from progressive neuropathy meaning that he cannot walk unaided as he has no balance .
2	a walking_stick was affecting one hip and he still needed to hold my hand with his other hand .
2	we tried a four wheeled rollator which was fine in the house and in town where it was smooth but useless elsewhere and had to be lifted over kerbs and door threshholds , not the best for someone without balance .
2	as we live on a farm it still left him unable to get any essential exercise .
2	the veloped is very sturdy and inspires confidence , it is larger than a four wheel rollator but you do not feel it will tip forward and feels much more stable .
2	it has very innovative design features , wheel removal , handle bar adjustment and folding mechanism are just one click operations .
2	the dual front_wheel is easily altered from the kerb and doorstep climbing position to country walking where both wheels travel on the ground reducing wheel wander .
2	the sliding seat is comfortable and the handle bar backrest makes one feel safer , this is a boon as my husband needs to have plenty of rests .
2	the build quality and finish are excellent and in - hub brakes are very effective and easy to adjust .
2	my husband is delighted with his veloped as it will help him maintain some mobility much longer , he feels ' bjorn ' again .
2	thankyou stefan .

2	excellent service , will_definatly use double0tickets again .
2	i ordered a desk which av0home kindly price matched .
2	delighted with the prompt service and the politeness of the staff .
2	easy to talk to a ' real_person '.
2	i have found both the service and support from seiretto first_class .
2	always polite and helpful , and hosting is totally reliable .
2	i can '_t fault them .
2	fantastic really pleased with both_pairs of rayban 0000 glasses .
2	customer service brilliant and delivery prompt .
2	one pair was out of stock but still arrived within 0_weeks .
2	thank_you alex will recommend to friends and family and will definitely order from you again .
2	i '_ve had very good experiences with the program and i got excellent service from marion at the help team when i had a problem with the installation .
2	many_thanks .
2	searching online for the cheapest place to buy a particular catflap , brought up ' easyanimal . co . uk '.
2	having not heard of them before , i was a bit_hesitant_about ordering , but went_ahead and did so anyway .
2	i am glad to report that i had absolutely no_problems at all with ordering , payment or delivery - which was swift and on - time .
2	i would have no_hesitation in using easyanimal again , or in recommending them to others .
2	i have used viovet on three or four occasions over the last_year and will happily continue to do so .
2	orders are easy to place and delivered quickly and they keep you informed by email with each_step of the process .
2	they also have an optional handy ' reminder ' service which you can set to your requirements and subscribe to .
2	i would have no_hesitation in recommending viovet .
2	have used dapw on a number of occasions and have never been disappointed with their service or the quality of their goods .
2	most_recent_purchase was an absolutely_beautiful mulberry_silk throw in taupe .
2	i was wary of ordering without knowing the actual measurements of this item - but the blanket is a good large size and lovely quality .
2	in fact , i have ordered two more !
2	i have also ' invested ' in some of their ultimate 0000 thread_count bed_linen - yes , a bit_pricey , compared to other options - but absolutely worth the outlay for such fine quality cotton .
2	now i am saving up for some of their goose_down pillows !
2	quick and easy
2	love love love_primark .
2	offer cheap clothes ( quality doesn_'_t matter when they are so cheap ).
2	grab a bargain
2	i first won items from 0st june , to date i have received about 00 items , i have won about 00 / 00 .
2	i won a sony viao ( 0_months_ago ), this week , after several emails , they eventually tell me the item is no_longer in stock .
2	they want to replace with a toshiba , they say this is an upgrade ( 0gb to 0gb ).
2	after i refused , they replied stating this is in the terms & conditions that they can replace any item won with another and its not based on rrp , just an upgrade .
2	does anyone know where i stand legally ?
2	order placed i sat and waited , email arrived a day later telling_me items had been dispatched .
2	very impressive i thought , then a text and another email_telling_me the date and time to expect my goods and that if this was not convenient please arrange a different time .
2	by now very impressed and the order was delivered within the specified period .
2	would recommend you to all my friends .
2	hopefully will not need another bed for a few_years but would go back to dreams if i did .
2	didn_'_t realise buying a bed could be so much fun .
2	excellent goods , and excellent service .
2	goods have always arrived so quickly i have never been disappointed .
2	until i found simplysupplements i was suffering regular periods of ibs , in fact it had started to happen 0 - 0 times a week which curtailed my life no end .
2	but since using the probiotic max for the last 0_months i have found that the episodes have reduced to about once or twice a month , so much_easier to cope with .
2	would recommend them to anyone , in fact have been doing just that and will_continue to sing_their_praises to all who will listen .
2	have investigated other_suppliers but the cost with simplysupplements is so much less and without_losing any of the quality .
2	so do not_hesitate order now !!
2	!
2	love this site , it '_s service is quick and efficient and also a lot_cheaper_than vet '_s prices .
2	i have recommended it to several friends all of who are as thrilled as i am as they can now afford the best for their pets .
2	well_done best pet keep it up !!

2	whenvever i find out that yodel are delivering my parcel ( of which i have many ) my heart sinks .
2	on this occasion i received a text at 00 . 00am ( after everyone had left the house for work ) to say my parcel would be delivered within two_days .
2	at 00 . 00pm i received another text to say they had tried to deliver and would try again the next_day .
2	does yodel really expect anyone to sit in and not make a noise ( in case you miss the knock on the door ) for two_days ??
2	[_external_reference_] can give you an_hour time_slot with previous warning , so why can '_t yodel ??
2	i always leave a note on the door to say leave on the doorstep if no answer ( we are in a rural_area and our doorstep is very secure ) but only yodel are unable to carry out the customers wish '_s like their_competitors .
2	i have no issue whatsoever with the delivery guys - they are always polite and understanding as to my frustration and i understand they have strict rules , but i do have a real issue with yodel as a company .
2	suggestions - give the customer a one to two hour time_slot with adequate notice and if the customer indicates a safe drop_off point then allow that delivery to be made .
2	on this occasion it was a pair of flip_flops that took two delivery attempts !
2	potential_customers of yodel - please think very carefully before using yodel as your delivery source as it could have a damaging effect on customers future_purchases with you .
2	rant_over !
2	can i also add this is not the first issue with yodel and i '_m_sure it wont_be the last unless they start listening to what their customers want ........
2	an easy to use web_site that allows you to see your completed product .
2	excellent value for money and fantastic customer service .
2	they delivered on the day that they said and the product arrived in one piece .
2	a very happy customer .
2	highly_recommended .
2	thank_you very much .
2	i was ill and couldn_'_t get out but needed my tyre replacing at home .
2	i got a quick fast and very courteous service .
2	would definitely use again .
2	very impressed with the speed the tickets arrived , and excellent seats , now looking_forward very much to the show .
2	george michael in manchester - can '_t wait .
2	very helpful staff when we needed an extra ticket !
2	we also purchased tickets to see cheryl and once again , superb seats for a fabulous show .
2	will_definately be using double 0 again .
2	i use illumi to buy delicious_meals for my elderly_parents . they are quick to prepare and easy to store as they do not require refigeration .
2	perfect meals for one with fast delivery thrown in !
2	i recently ordered some frog health from viovet , and as usual i experienced excellent service , good price for the product and very speedy delivery .
2	couldn_'_t be_happier and will definitely use them again
2	i have used appliance planet many_times .
2	they are always cheaper_than other online_retailers and delivery times are exceptional , often next_day .
2	can '_t recommend them highly_enough
2	excellent service .
2	was kept_informed by text and was able to track my order from 0am on morning of delivery and was kept up to date with the time slots .
2	delivered exactly in the 0 hour time_slot .
2	ordered on tuesday for delivery on friday unfortunately goods were not delivered from manufacturer until friday so order was delayed till the saturday but that was suitable anyway .
2	no_problems_whatsoever but would like if delivery slots were available for convenience .
2	we were kept up to date with the status of the order and given a delivery date .
2	as we were unable to take delivery that day we selected the option from the email to choose another convenient date .
2	on the day of delivery i was emailed and text a one hour delivery time_slot which was accurate !
2	if only all online purchases were so straight_forward and user_friendly , thank_you !
2	excellent selection of chamilia beads .
2	first_class service , and super customer service dealing_with questions too !
2	speedy delivery !
2	easy to navigate website ...
2	fully deserving of 0_star_rating .
2	excellent service , easy to use website , delivery within couple of days even at this busy time .
2	excellent choice of product and great prices - what more can i say ???
2	?
2	do not delay - go and check this site out ...............
2	was so pleased - see below - when i received my tickets for war of the worlds - but am even more delighted now that i have seen the show and had such great seats .
2	0th_row back and in the middle - we could not have had better seats and loved the show .
2	thank_you double0 you are on my top list of websites and will_definately use you again , in fact going to look at waht tickets are available right now - well_done and thanks again - highly_recommended .
2	great website ; easy to use even for me !!!
2	ordering tickets for jeff wayne war of the worlds in december_0000 at the 00 made easier by double 0 making positive_comments about seating ie great seats for a great view - and supplying a seating_plan which was easy to follow .
2	tickets arrived within a couple of days even_though its only august_0000 .
2	highly_recommended website and company
2	sheila bull
2	great website .
2	lots of info to make the choice easier to make .
2	product is a gift so hasn_'_t been used yet .
2	i ordered a printer from the website , which seemed to indicate that it would be available .
2	the next_day came a commendably early call to my wife ( as i was at work ) advising that , although the printer was advertised on the website , it was no_longer available .
2	an_alternative was offered , but at over twice the cost ( plus_vat ).
2	a further call followed while i was still at work , wanting to speak to me as the card_holder and then promising to call later , when i returned .
2	no call came , despite my waiting in , so i went elsewhere for my new printer - a lost opportunity for the company .
2	well made easy to use and comfortable , goos quick delivery , will defintely use company again
2	i needed a satnav in a hurry for my son to return to germany on his recently_purchased motorbike .
2	i ordered online one the monday_evening .
2	i then needed to check some discrepancy in the details about delivery .
2	i emailed sportsbikeshop and then called on the tuesday . my call was picked_up on the second ring .
2	i spoke to a friendly , efficient and coherent young_man who gave_me clear_instructions and advice , with my email in front of him .
2	just as promised , the satnav was delivered an_hour within the time_slot on the wednesday_morning .
2	i am very impressed - brilliant service , thank and well_done .
2	needed to change the delivery address on a pre booked parcel , the change was done very quickly and efficiently .
2	many_thanks to lauren w for her help .
2	kept_fully advised of delivery time .
2	arrived on time .
2	friendly delivery men .
2	ordered dishwasher also for family .
2	they had exactly same experience .
2	would recommend them .
2	i shall definitely use them again .
2	well_done ao . com
2	the delivery will take a few_days but the driver was very friendly unlike_some other company drivers !
2	i '_ve even got a couple of pounds back into my account for next time .
2	will use again as my local company which i have favoured for many_years fails to understand that their drivers are rude and obnoxious .
2	i managed to save some money compared to viovet and a couple of other_suppliers plus the medicin arrived in very good time .
2	i will definitely be back in the future .
2	the product is delicious and arrived super_fast , plus it was the most competitive price i could find :) thanks .
2	i have bought my iams_dog_food from gjw_titmuss countless_times and i would say that 00_% of the time they are the cheapest and 000_% of the time they deliver within 0 working_days , that is why i shop with them every couple of months .
2	great website with lots of stoc variet .
2	pronpt delivery .
2	impressive
2	i have used this site several_times and have never been disappointed .
2	i can always save money and find what i need and want .
2	they have fast shipping to keep me going and keep me healthy .
2	i also love the free gifts that i can always use .
2	enjoy your savings !
2	easy to use , only takes a few_minutes to look up and use . good incentives .
2	great website and company .
2	i used the uk_pianos website and downloaded the online guide about digital_pianos , which i found very informative and helpful .
2	i was able to make an informed choice of piano as a result .
2	communications on the phone were equally reassuring , and the piano arrived within a week , on the arranged day .
2	highly_recommended .
2	grest waiting
2	i find this site valuable , as many of my friends and family have problems regarding money .. they are able to save for retirement , holidays and also keep upto_date with their insurances ... by comparing on this site ... also i use the money transfers companies ... having a property abroad .. very easy to use ... we also have a forum , where we try to help each other and new members to the forum ... we have great fun with the help of all the staff at money . co . uk .
2	i tell my friends to come onto the site and have a good look
2	very interesting ...
2	yep , pleased to use aferry .. always a good price ....
2	i tend to forget to ask to be parked by the lift ... due to a disability ..
2	but i will remember this time on thursday am ..
2	but yes no problem at all ...
2	the staff on board more than helpful .. and if my breakfast is a little too cool , it normally is ( must be saving on heating ).
2	there is a microwave for us to use ...

2	.. but no problem staff change with no problem ...
2	a ferry ... well_done on prices ... stops me going elsewhere ...

2	my relatively late booking for the 00th_october diana krall concert at the royal_albert_hall went_smoothly .

2	decent price and quick delivery .
2	good quality bow_tie .
2	couldn_'_t ask for more !
2	easy ordering , delivery ok . not the fastest but all received .
2	however i was disappointed that the worming_tablets i purchased have a very short use by date .
2	i bought in bulk to last at_least a year but the ones i received need to be used by the beginning of august , so some will end up getting put in the bin .
2	they ' re not cheap to just throw_away either :( i would buy again but would be selective in my purchases so '_s not to be short_dated again .
2	shopped_around for what i wanted and these were the cheapest and free_p_&_p which i always love .
2	ordering was easy , plenty of communication to let_me know what was going on every_step of the way .
2	fast delivery too and pleased to say exactly_what i ordered / wanted .
2	could not ask for more .
2	will deffo use them again .
2	thanks very much :-)

2	my mobile contract is with talktalk have had limited service or none for 0_days .
2	customer service do not have any idea when normal service will be resumed they told me i would just have to be patient !!!!!
2	perhaps they will have to be patient for their payment !
2	i was told yesterday that it '_s vodafone '_s fault as they share a network .
2	when i asked how long before it would be back to normal i was told i had to contact vodafone to find out .
2	i am so angry surely my contract is with talktalk and they should find out when it will be sorted when i said this i was told they could not contact vodafone it was up to me !!
2	we have had similar problems with our broadband ( very slow speeds ) which was also with them .
2	we cancelled and went to bt and have a much_better service .
2	my advice would be steer_clear !!!
2	!
2	very easy site to use and rugby shirt promptly arrived a couple of days_later .
2	i bought an exercise_bike - after_researching i found the best deal on sweatband .
2	the whole_process was very easy , communications were clear and all went to plan
2	i ordered an aeg tumble_dryer on next_day delivery .
2	i received a text at 0am advising me of the estimated time of delivery and a link to check during the day .
2	the drivers phoned me to say they were running early and would that be ok ?
2	excellent service , product delivered and installed efficiently .
2	would definitely recommend
2	we have used mattress man 0 times_now and totally recommend them .
2	this time it was for a bed_frame .
2	website v easy to use , love the fact that you can choose the delivery date and pay extra for times if you want .

2	would absolutely recommend
2	house_network were so easy to deal with from beginning to end .
2	please do not worry_about them not being a " high_st estate_agent " - it really does not matter a jot .
2	my first interaction was through webchat , asking about the service , charges , valuation , photos etc - the guy i spoke with ( mark ) was amazing and even sent me a transcript of our chat by email afterwards .
2	everything was organised , even the appointment for the photographer to come and take my pictures .
2	she was great and being_able to play with my own pictures and approve the wording of my advert was great too .
2	from deciding to put my house on the market on the sunday_night , i had my photographs taken on the wed and my house was showing on rightmove on thursday - very very quick .
2	every interaction i have had has_been friendly and efficient .
2	i would definitely recommend .

2	well_done house_network - i am an advocate .
2	i ordered a bag tidy for my daughter - i received as expected with a lovely personalised thankyou
2	great service and would definitely use again
2	i have no_issues with the booking process , however due to the late arrival of the chauffer on my departure i nearly_missed my flight .
2	the company was called stress_free parking and i waited 00minutes for a chauffer to arrive .
2	i had to make a number of calls to check their progress and in fact check - in had closed by the time i reached the counter .
2	i had already advised the controller that if i had to pay any change of booking_fees that these would be forwarded to the company as the whole idea of booking valet_parking was to ensure minimum delay .
2	as it happened the flight was late in boarding and my checked bag was able to be accepted through security .
2	this combination of these two factors meant that i was the last to board my flight .
2	needless to say it was not a stress_free parking experience .
2	i '_ve been really impressed , not just with the speed of service but with the courteous emails which keep me informed of the progress of the order from the moment it '_s made online to the arrival of the goods .
2	as the owner of an elderly_dog with specific dietary_needs , the company has saved me a fortune .
2	it '_s a 00st_century service with good old - fashioned and genuine customer_care at its core - a rare_thing .
2	i purchased a memory_foam_mattress for my teenage_son from the ebay shop maintained by memory_foam warehouse .
2	excellent service from_start to finish .
2	the item arrived promptly , was well_wrapped , as_described and excellent value for money .
2	my son_loves_his new mattress and i '_d fully recommend this company to anyone in need of a new mattress .
2	i am a customer of this company for many_years .
2	they always provide excellent service - high_quality items , fast delivery , advice about their products , quick response to any question .
2	highly_recommended !
2	marina
2	excellent product , fab customer service and speedy delivery .. would recommend 000 #
2	the perfumes on offer are often significantly cheeper_than in retail_stores and postage is free if you are happy with 0nd_class delivery .
2	always comes within 0 - 0 working_days , extremely well_packaged so no_breakages and if perfume unavailable no problem in getting a refund .
2	i used hostelbookers last_year when i was on a 0month uk and europe trip ... with no_hassles at all .
2	since then , even for local travel , i use hostels too , as it '_s so easy to use their website and there '_s so much info in the reviews , maps , directions , that you feel you know places when you arrive .
2	the one thing that i need to know is that my money is safe when i give over my financial details and this area of trust is huge when you are on a tight_budget , that '_s a big draw card for me .
2	am off on a 00 week similar european / uk jaunt in a month and of course am using hostelbookers again for 000_+ nights !
2	the other thing is that the site is simple to use and you don_'_t get bombarded with adds and heaps of other off putting info when you ' re trying to stay focused on just getting what you typed in to get !
2	00 / 00 from me .
2	being a novice on the internet i was recommended the company parcel0go to send my son in america a parcel . i asked for help and chatted on line to daniel who guided_me through it from beginning to end , and the price was lower_than i expected .
2	plus having the tracking on my parcel made it easier .
2	the parcel was picked_up at the door and arrived in america 0_days_later how good was that .. so next week i will be sending another parcel and hope this one arrives just as quickly ..
2	i would definitely recommend this company to family and friends .. so thank_you mr peter_chandler i couldn_'_t fault your courier service mrs l woodhouse .. wigan .
2	so this is the complaint i have just sent them .
2	i will post again re the rest of the story ... let '_s see if anyone will actually contact me and if the parcel will ever be collected
2	dear_sir or madam ,
2	i would like to complain_about the service i have received and am continuing to receive from your company re the above order .
2	when i booked the delivery last thursday online it was booked for collection on friday .
2	i organised someone to wait in all day on friday but no one came .
2	over the weekend no one came either .
2	on monday i found out how to contact your instant messanger help and was assured it was to be collected that day .
2	you have guessed it no one came .
2	on tuesday it had been deleted from your system and when i finally got through on the instant help i was told it would definitely be collected today .
2	we have been waiting in all day and contacting your service only to find a card put through the door about 0pm - two of us were in the house and the bell did not ring .
2	the name on the card is patricia and the number given is 00000000000 however the only facility is to send a text which has not been answered .
2	all your online people keep doing is saying it will be rebooked for the next_day with no sense that this cannot go on forever and at some point complaints have to be escalated .
2	i have finally_managed to get them to agree that a manager chloe will call me tomorrow but i need to get this parcel collected by someone_who is capable of ringing a doorbell .
2	excuse me if i sound angry it is because i am .
2	i hope that someone can contact me urgently on my mobile tomorrow to reassure_me that someone is aware of this problem and something is being done .
2	in_spite of the pension_fund i was using to purchase an annuity was very small , age_partnership was able to obtain a higher income than my fund_provider .
2	the whole_process was efficient and very professional with excellent communication_throughout .
2	highly_recommended .
2	( ref_:_000000 )
2	an easy friday_afternoon ordering tyres off the internet , came recommended to me , happy to continue the trend .
2	i have had quite a few things from this site now since_discovering them a couple of years_ago & all have been good quality & excellent value for money .
2	i will_continue to be a customer & their customer service is brilliant .
2	i wish all sites were like this .
2	the lenses were excellent , but one had split , i contacted customer service via_email & there response was to send both contact_lenses back with a full_refund , i am a really happy customer who would certainly recommend this company !
2	i ordered a samsung_galaxy_s0 on the 0th_dec expecting it to be here for my daughters xmas_present , after a number of calls and emails i still_havent had a answer to where it is , i feel i have been_scammed

2	every time i have ordered from viovet they have delivered the goods in two_days .

2	yodel have been brilliant .
2	the parcel always comes on the right day , i get texts and e_-_mails to tell me its on its way , and the driver is courteous friendly and helpful .
2	can '_t ask for more than that .
2	couldn_'_t_believe_how quick and efficient this service is .
2	just as if i '_d had the thought about it , and then the products magically arrived .
2	thankyou for making life so much_easier
2	i have just used this fab perfume shop on - line .
2	their prices are great and they post things almost the next_day , they are called cheapsmells , and they had everything from vintage to really new makes .
2	so next xmas you will probably get perfume !
2	!
2	web_site clear and precise .
2	price excellant and communication prompt and efficient .
2	item arrived within a few_days and i will_definately use them again .
2	not much more to be said .
2	quality is good , value is good , delivery is quick
2	i have purchased from pcspecialists for many_years and will_continue all in all still a good service but when building your_own computer on line they don_'_t tell you of any compatability issues in my case i had the rampage motherboard and cosmos 0 tower i added two usb 0 '_s to the front of the tower but was not informed that i would loose two out of 0 of my usb0 ports they are there but not working as they can '_t be attached to the motherboard ?
2	so i have wasted money .
2	also i have a 0 . 0 creative speaker system but i can only use 0 . 0 as the motherboard doesn_'_t have the grey sound port ?
2	this was not explained to me but the tech guy '_s when i asked about my sound system ?
2	lastly i can '_t connect my brother_printer wirelessly and the tech guy '_s again can '_t help instead they tell me to contact the hardware manafacturer of the wireless card they installed ?
2	quality products at the best price in the uk .
2	i purchased the lg 00lm000v smart_tv , the customer service was second to none .
2	they were happy to help with my inquiries and offered easy to understand instructions .
2	will check this company out when i need other items first .
2	great job customer_services and well_done to the company .
2	i will always purchase from this company excellent service
2	ordered a gerbera bouquet on 0th_feb for delivery on 0th_feb .
2	bouquet was for a dear_friend '_s 00st_birthday .
2	the flowers were not delivered on the 0th .
2	i communicated via online " chat " on 0th towards the end of day , was informed they would be delivered by 0pm .
2	they were not .
2	i then communicated via chat again on the 0th asking where they were .
2	was informed there had been a problem with the delivery van , but that they would be delivered today , and was given a £ 0 voucher_code as an_apology .
2	my friend has just called to say the flowers have been delivered ... and they are dead , leaves all dropped_off and whole_thing squashed .
2	how horrible , embarrassing and sad .
2	she is taking a photo of them for me so i can take it up with iflorist .
2	this was the first time i have used them ( usually use interflora ), and very definitely the last .
2	do not use this company if you want a reliable service .
2	i am so disappointed .
2	quick delivery one of items went_awol in transit but customer_services rectified the problem with the courier very quickly .
2	excellent service .
2	very helpful and friendly
2	very , very pleased i used age_partnership to arrange my pension_annuity .
2	although a complex subject to us mere mortals , it was made easy by the professionalism and information provided by omar mesbahi .
2	i was taken through every_step of the way and kept_informed of progress .
2	he found me the best deal for my annuity .
2	can '_t thank him enough .

2	the people at trueshopping were super , and tried their best to help us when their delivery company failed to arrive in time , we waited in all day until 0 . 00_pm and had to go on holiday without the generator we had purchased , and it was eventually delivered a day late , the delivery company failed to telephone before arriving , it was lucky my neighbour was around when they eventually showed up .
2	if i was buying again , i '_d be reluctant to use trueshopping because their despatch company lets them down .
2	i had a very bad_experience with this company .
2	no one was there to greet me when i arrived and their telephone_lines were busy .
2	i called over and over to find out when they were arriving for me and could get no answer .
2	in the end i had to leave or miss my flight .
2	had to leave my car in short_stay car_park which i then had to pay for on return .
2	the company are now refusing to refund me what i paid them despite not giving me any service .
2	maybe if it goes_smoothly they are great but what makes a good company is how they treat you when there is a problem .
2	this is the second time i '_ve_used animed , and both_times had no_problems .
2	they offer free delivery which with some companies can take a week to receive your goods but mine arrived a couple of days_later .
2	their prices are really competative .
2	will use this company again
2	items i ordered were delivered quickly , well_packaged , and at very competitive_prices .
2	will definitely buy from here again
2	found the product i wanted here cheaper_than_anywhere_else , fast free delivery , great service .
2	would definitely shop_here again and recommend to others .
2	price was very competative and the delivery was super_fast arrived in under 00_hrs would recommend to friends
2	thanks for an excellent quick and reliable service
2	i was telephoned to explain that my first order had to be directed to my credit_card address , which was not great for me but it is a policy for first orders so i was happy to respect that .
2	the order arrived within 0_days and the couriers did have to come_back a second day to re - deliver .
2	so overall i was very happy with the service i recieved and with certainly look at using this company again for my consumables or any other printers i require
2	this was a good delivery as the driver followed my exact instructions as to where to leave the parcel .
2	the parcel was undamaged & came on time .
2	excellent service .
2	not used these ink_cartridges yet but they are the original ones same as you buy in the shop but at a much_cheaper price .
2	they arrive by post very fast .
2	excellent service & the only place i will buy my inks from now .
2	what an easy site to use & what fantastic prices .
2	transaction was fast & easy & i have great value tyres that will be fitted at my convenience .
2	i ordered this product for a friend who hates_shopping online .
2	she telephoned more handles for product advice & was very impressed with their knowledge & service .
2	i ordered the handles for her & they arrived speedily .
2	she is delighted with the appearance & quality of the product .
2	now she wants to go " internet_shopping " more frequently :)
2	the quality of the products is the highest you will find .
2	the customer service is excellent .
2	healthspan are always_willing to answer any_questions you may have .
2	the products arrive very fast .
2	there is a varied_selection of vitamins & minerals & the only problem is you want so many of them .
2	i keep it to what i really need or i would be swallowing tablets all day .
2	can not recommend this company enough .
2	they are the only one i trust & would order nowhere_else .
2	excellent service , very competative_prices , fast efficient next_day delivery , helpful staff .
2	we have ordered printers , ink and toner_cartridges from printerland and we will_continue to use them for all our printer and ink requirements in the future .
2	ordered a gorenje retro fridge_freezer , it was delivered within 0_days and within the 0 hour time_slot which was advised the previous evening to the delivery .
2	the availability of the unit was great as many places had to order it in , the price was also very competitive .
2	very pleased with it and the service .
2	best price i could find anywhere online and prompt friendly service - will definitely use this company again .
2	i was really impressed with this site , easy to locate my favourite_perfumes , even those really expensive ones , that are not in the shops .
2	price unbelieable bargins for quality .

2	a very smooth on line purchase with delivery the following_day . would recommend to others .
2	very happy with the service .
2	easy system .
2	a couple of disappointments :
2	0 .
2	i needed to order some vietnamese dong but your company did not seem to handle this particular currency .
2	0 .
2	i would have liked to have been able to enter the foreign_currency amount in the request box as i required a set amount of us dollars .
2	your website seemed to ony allow figures in the english pound box , and then adjust with + and - which i found a little unsatisfactory .
2	very impressed with the ease of bank transfers , the updating e_-_mails from currency_club letting_me know exactly_what stage the transaction had reached , and the next_day special delivery of the currency to my home .
2	brilliant .
2	thank_you .
2	we ordered doors in several sizes as we had created a dressing_room in our small bedroom .
2	having built the frame and put in rails etc we needed modern doors to add the finishing_touch .
2	we submitted our measurements online .. placed the order and then rang to ask advice on how many hinged etc ... we found them very helpful .
2	delivery was made we installed the doors and we are very happy with the result .
2	would recommend kitchen_door workshop !
2	as a person very experienced in all matters ' diy ' i found assembling the metal garage very very time_consuming and the instructions not as helpful as they could be !
2	the fact that there are so many small pieces to put_together to make each part of the building makes it a blind task unless you have previously erected one and would therefore be aware of pitfalls encountered .
2	i certainly would not advise anyone to attempt this unless you have a few_days spare and lots of help and patience in abundance !
2	the building looks good now it is up and all becomes clear mistakes included !
2	couldn_'_t be easier !
2	we never realised there was a company sending flowers that had so much class .
2	totally brilliant and the way they keep you updated on your delivery was excellent .
2	smashed the likes of interflora off the planet .
2	will never use anyone_else .
2	many_thanks .
2	this is the ultimate company for me . whenever i want something on line amazon are the boys i try first and i am hardly_ever dissappointed . fabulous service from speedy delivery and first_class quality and if anything does happen to go_wrong they fix it very quickly . excellent .
2	yes . very good service . price better and love the free service . you will definitely be getting my buisness in the future .
2	ordered on friday_morning goods arrived on saturday !
2	couldn_'_t ask for better service .
2	will_definately
2	be using this company again .
2	i had to return an item because the colour wasn_'_t right .
2	i called to confirm that it had been received .
2	there was no information available but the advisor ( christine atkins ) said she would monitor my account and would call me to confirm_receipt and action a refund .
2	the following_day she called and advised that everything was in order and the refund had been actioned .
2	this lady did everything she said she would and in a really efficient and friendly_manner .
2	she '_s a credit to the company .
2	if only this was the case with every company !
2	value for money , competitive_pricing ... one of the fastest free of charge deliveries on the web .
2	really great prices for our veterinary products , as we all know buying from our own vets can be very expensive .
2	wide_range of products and food ... a one stop_shop .. great customer service and really quick delivery
2	every time i wear an item i '_ve purchased online from jules_b i get so many comments .
2	it doesn_'_t stop at where did you get it .
2	they want to know more .
2	i live in australia so the items on jules_b are very different from most clothing items we are exposed to down under !
2	i get stopped every time - at the supermarket , at the rta , at the bank , on the street .
2	i '_m_sure i '_ve created a whole new customer base in sydney from myself alone .
2	thats how good jules_b is .
2	as this was our_honeymoon we wanted something special and that is exactly_what we got .
2	we had been into several travel agencies and felt_pressurised but on speaking to the advisor tina at very cheap holidays she made us feel comfortable from_start to finish .
2	we knew where we wanted to go and she gave_us her advice and of course fantastic price and on no occasion were we pressurised to use the company or bombarded with telephone_calls which is what we had with other_companies .
2	she advised the hotel it was our_honeymoon and also my husbands_00th_birthday and we had a bottle of champagne chilling in our room when we arrived .
2	we were also thankful of her suggestion of the extra baggage_allowance and felt quite smug watching everyone else panicking with their lowly 00kg .
2	we will_definately book again with very cheap holidays and of course via tina .
2	this company have absolutly no after sales support .... i purchased helium_balloons and a helium cylinder and it was the biggest mistake i made in years ........ after just half an_hour the balloons started to drop and within an_hour they were all on the floor ... i called partyrama and asked for help and advice to be told there was nothing they could do as they did not do a same day delivery and that i was to blame even if they could deliver i would have to pay for a new cylinder because i should of inflated the balloons at the party not at home hours before .... just as well i did do them at home can you imagin the embarrasment of helium_balloons on the floor at the party ..... i suggest you stay clear of this company ... i will never use them ever again ......
2	i have been using interparcel for several_years_now to send regular parcels to france .
2	the website is so easy to use and the service consistently reliable .
2	if i had to suggest any improvement , it would be useful to be able to store an address that i use regularly .
2	thank_you interparcel !
2	my past experience with pcspecialist has always been positive .
2	my latest order has_been a bit dissapointing .
2	the specification for my machine was quite high for running xphe , but the performance is very poor .
2	i investigated this further and can put it down to the hitachi 0tb hdd having a write speed of 00mb / s and a read speed of 000mb / s .
2	the write speed is very dissapointing and drags the performance of what would be a very good computer that will be used for video editing .
2	the hdd is also very noisy compared to the previous machines i have ordered from pcspecialist .
2	finally , the promised firewire sockets were absent , however a pci card is in the post .....
2	don_'_t buy anything before checking the quidcio site .
2	i have found it to be a fantastic way of earning_money without_any hassle .
2	i found that they lived_up to their promises and delivered excellent results .
2	with so many providers to choose from i would be happy to recommend age_partnership .
2	if whiskey is your choice , but mainstream is not .. look here 0st .. delivery very prompt .. all_round excellent .
2	ran_out of my favorite dead sea sulphor soap and only one brach of boots near me sell it but couldnt get to the shop so surfed the net and found exact_same soap on oneclick woohoo ordered 0 bars and the cost of that plus the postage came out under what it would have cost me to travel to boots without the hassle am very happy and will be using oneclick again for sure
2	very easy transaction and pleased with product and delivery
2	i must commend the service .
2	prompt emails throughout the purchasing process and then a 0 hour delivery slot with a named_driver .
2	mattresses and duvets arrived exactly on time as promised .
2	packing excellent , all in zip bags .
2	quality products .
2	just had first night and felt the difference immediately .
2	as a woman of a certain_age who has spent 00 years being hot every night i am looking_forward to better sleep .
2	well_done wool_company .
2	ordered some moisturiser and night serum on 00th_feb , received it on 00st , can '_t fault the service and the quality of goods .
2	will be ordering all my beauty products from here in future will save myself a fortune .
2	:)
2	ordered christmas_gifts from them , money taken from my account immediately , no goods have arrived .
2	tried to email got a response stating the email could not be delivered , tried to phone got a message_stating the number was unavailable .
2	will never order online again ..... i am gutted , have lost money i have worked hard for all year .........:(
2	i found mazuma to be a very good and reliable service from finding the phones on the website , to getting confirmation , prepaid_envelope and then payment .
2	all completed in just over 0 week .
2	well_worth sorting_out all your old_phones and getting some money back for them .
2	. pierwszy raz kupowałam za pośrednictwem arredatutto . com , bardzo zachęciła mnie cena .
2	cały czas niezmiernie się stresowałam .
2	zamówiliśmy okap i piekarnik firmy smeg , na kwotę 0000_euro .

2	i have just taken possession of my seamaster omega and i am absolutely_delighted with it .
2	i was reluctant to spend so much money on - line .
2	thanks
2	wonderfull no_worries great guys would definatly use again
2	i love this company .
2	the selection is very good and the delivery is fast and reliable .
2	try them , you will love them .
2	been having problem with on line ordering , but they sort thing out quickly and efficiently !
2	there seems to be a problem sometimes when you place an order on line ..... you are meant to be taken to payment page but for some reason this does not happen !
2	campbells pull out all stops to make_sure you are not disappointed !
2	great service , like the old_fashioned shop service as well as too notch meat .
2	free delivery , discounts and freebies !
2	would recommend to anyone !
2	my monthly order fills my freezer and saves so much time , thanks cambells !
2	your service is excellent , your products are excellent and your staff the very best !
2	i '_ve tried a number of sites but this is head and shoulders_above the rest for ease of use .
2	their early bird system is well_worth upgrading to as you do get the opportunity of first viewings and refusal .
2	i '_ve found that by the time accommodation becomes free for all to contact , the best ones are already gone .
2	i traded an iphone0c with cex on saturday for a lumia 0000 which was faulty so i took it back on sunday as no other way to contact them , they offered me a replacement phone coming from s different shop , said it would be delivered tues / wed well post has_been and no phone also i dont have any receipts as the blackpool shop kept them i need someone to ring me or im contacting the police as im out of pocket to the tune of £_000 this is just stupid no way of getting intouch other than having to go into_town to the shop , getting the feeling i have been ripped_off big time i have given them until_0pm today to contact me or im going to have the iphone blocked
2	spent 00_minutes in carphone_warehouse in blackpool bought the gemini tablet online before xmas for a gift less_than a month later packs up customer service say take it back to your local_store which i did today guess_what cos its out of 00 days cant get money back but if an item is faulty by law under the sale of goods_act im entitled to a refund ,, noooo not at carphone stand around and wait while staff yawn , text , mess with their phones , then told we have to send it away for repair , but wait ( another 00_mins ) we dont repair that tablet we replace it ,,, but i dont want a replacement as its crap and will break again , well thats our policy and thats all were offering , well i want to speak to manager cos under the sale of goods_act , remember that ::::::: all goods must be :
2	as_described
2	of satisfactory quality and
2	fit for purpose
2	if they ' re not , the retailer is in breach of contract and you have a claim under the sale of goods_act .
2	well i wait a bit more to speak to the man in charge only to be told we can only offer a replacement ,, oh and now the same tablet is cheaper and to add_insult to injury you dont get the difference back in what you paid and what we now sell it at ,,,,, so i now have same tablet but for more money plus i know it will be going back cos its rubbish and will break again , so i came home made a complaint to their customer service department on the phone but she was reading from the same script ,,,, lesson to be learned , if your buying from them they cant do enough for you , in - between the yawns and the texting their mates , but if you want to take back a faulty item take a flask and a blanket cos you will be there a while , and dont expect them to adhere to the law cos its not there policy ,,,,,, the end ( well for now anyway )
2	where do i begin in january this year me and my husband decided wed like a change from the car we had a chevrolet kalos which we also purchased from stoneacre and said we never would again after the problems we had with the kalos anyway we thought wed try them again what a mistake they couldnt do us a deal on what we wanted so the salesman phoned us up the following_day said hed found us a nice car that he could do us a deal on so off we went to look at it it was a renault_megane it was lovely so we bought it what a mistake the car went in about 0 times first time it was just little things like heater control and a few bulbs didnt work when the car was repaired we picked it up only to find that the mechanics had damaged the centre console so it went back to have a new one fitted got the car back again had it a few_days and the gearbox started having problems so the car went back to be repaired again this continued for the next 0 month in the end finance and stoneacre decided we could change the car to a fiat_panda low and behold this has_been a nightmare in and out of stoneacres for repairs only had the car 0_months and its been in for repair 0 times already to which there saying they cant find anything wrong with it but we get it back and the following_day the problem starts again we paid for a life time guarantee on the megane only to find out we had to pay another life time guarantee when we got the panda bearing in mind we only had the megane 0_months i just dont_think this is fair why couldnt they have transferred the guarantee from the megane onto the panda for goodwill but no they wont they have ended costing us more money because the panda was less money than the megane the situation now is were so fed_up because they now want us to take the car in and let the mechanic have it a few_days to see if the problem_occurs while in his hands or they will buy the car back for a reduced price of what we paid for it we are now looking elsewhere as the problem is still persisting all we want is a car we can_rely_on dont_think weve been treated fair at all
2	have been very very impressed with diy_kitchens .
2	okay , so you need to know what to order ( including end panels , plinth , cornice , handles ), but ordering is pretty straightforward and it is well_worth making the effort as the prices are amazing .
2	things i have really liked about diy_kitchens :-
2	- massive_range of unit sizes / styles , allowing you to create a truly bespoke looking kitchen
2	- good quality units .
2	was a little_nervous_about how good the quality would be , but even our carpenters who fitted the kitchen were impressed !
2	- ready built units .
2	saved_loads of time at installation
2	- colours .
2	we went for a painted kitchen , and could pick any farrow & ball colour
2	- unit ' options '.
2	you can ask for units to be dry assembled , and have screw in feet , allowing you to adapt units easily .
2	we have used base_unit on a base_unit to create mid height oven housings , and done the same to create some extra high storage areas .
2	- massive_selection of ' finishing_touches ' - pop up power points , intergrated bins , magic corner units etc etc
2	- tea & biscuits with the order - carpenters were very happy .
2	- sorting_out post delivery problems .
2	we had a couple of doors missing .
2	these took about 00 days to come , but we were kept_informed and they were very helpful !
2	if i could change anything about their service ( and i '_m getting petty now )
2	- would be great to get sample painted boards for the bespoke painted kitchens ( we chose colours from test patches painted in the wall )
2	- delivery notes that are easier to check off against the order ( need to ensure everything is okay within 00_hours ).
2	other things to consider if you order from diy_kitchens :-
2	- don_'_t underestimate the space you will need when the cabinets arrive !
2	- be sure of what you need before you order !
2	- get yourself a good fitter ( who can often advise on what you will need in terms of panels / cornices before you order )
2	- measure carefully and check how units fit ( i . e .
2	does it fit flush against the wall ?)
2	you can phone diy_kitchens for this information .
2	i am a very happy customer and would heartily_recommend diy_kitchens .
2	we were very impressed with the service we received from dailaflight , in particular on rep arthur and will use
2	them again
2	did parts of quote online but when i hit a problem called paying too much which is 0000 number .
2	i spoke to an advisor called steve who took me through the whole of my medical_conditions & who did not rush me at all .
2	my price was £_00 . 00 which was a nice_surprise considering i paid £_000 two years_ago when i contacted an insurance company myself .
2	highly_recommend this company to anyone
2	spoke to the staff in edinborough shop & they checked the item as i asked any_questions .
2	ordered & it arrived in 0_days .
2	well_packaged & in perfect_condition & working order .
2	well pleased
2	hi
2	i bought 0 for 0 inks for my kodak esp0000 & have just used a compatible from you & the picture is all red & white stripes down faces .
2	it worked_fine with the kodaks .
2	i also phoned you after i had sent in my order to say i didn_'_t realize that i had to put in a code for the 0 for 0 offer so i paid full price .
2	the gent i talked to said it would come off my next order but i don_'_t have an account with you as i paid through amazon so can find nothing from you .
2	order no .
2	000 - 0000000 - 0000000 , this is the second time i have sent this as no answer from you by email
2	prompt service , good quality wetsuit , would recommend
2	please_avoid this company like the plague !!!
2	ordered a acer tablet for my sons xmas_present , they sent a email setting out the dispatch time and delivery times , as this time ( 0_days ) passed i then emailed for find out what was happening , but just received an_automated_reply , i then read the reviews on the company and started to panic !!
2	lots of people were or had been in my boat .
2	eventually got through to their customer_services agents , what a joke that is !!
2	cancelled the order and was promised a full_refund within 0_days , 0_days and numerous_emails later i am still_waiting !!!
2	what a shame they can offer very competitive_prices but their customer_services badly lets them down .
2	avoid !
2	!
2	fast service and good product .
2	ordered items after the cut_off time so that i could have them delivered on the date required ( 0nd_october ).
2	at 00 . 00 on the due date a courier arrived .
2	i understood that the two items were coming from different companies so would not_necessarily arrive together .
2	what i wasn_'_t expecting was to have only half the components for my desk delivered with no legs for it and no chair at all .
2	of course , their customer service team only work from 00am to 0pm whilst their customers are potentially still_waiting for their goods .
2	i am now not at home for another couple of days which means that i can '_t set_up my home office and get it all working .
2	buyer_beware - although i still only have half a desk , the customer service that i have since received has_been excellent .
2	i sent an_email after the goods failed to arrive and received a call from furniture 000 at 0 . 00am on 0rd_october to sort it out .
2	i will update further once the issue has_been resolved .
2	final update
2	box 0 arrived on time with part of the desk .
2	box 0 finally arrived on saturday .
2	i firmly_believe this was the fault of city_link ( who are total p00p ).
2	the chair that was supposed to arrive next_day was re - scheduled for the saturday with dpd ( confirmation text received ).
2	my oh dropped me off at a course in london and had to speed home on the friday because i received a text stating delivery would be friday between 00 . 00 & 00 . 00 .
2	apparently they were going to attempt delivery but it was definitely scheduled in for the saturday if no one was home .
2	he made it back and within 0 minutes of him being home , dpd delivered .
2	i wouldn_'_t use this company again as i spent too much time trying to actually get the goods that had been paid for ,
2	because i can '_t even get a response from their so called customer service team .
2	i placed an order for two items - syringes and melolin pads ( basic medical items ).
2	got an_email the following_day saying part of the order was out of stock .
2	tried to call cs - on hold for ages so thought i would email .
2	the link in the email didn_'_t work and the email address it was sent from said it was an unmonitored one - but it was the same email address given to contact the sales / cs_team .
2	i eventually got sent a link to a ticket that had been opened on 00 . 00 . 00 morning and i have asked three_times since then whether the order has_been cancelled as i requested .
2	no response in 00_hours and their online_chat is a total_joke .
2	after four minutes it logged out of the chat box and an_email template popped_up .
2	how this company makes money is a wonder .
2	avoid at all costs .
2	if a medical company can '_t stock something as basic as a syringe , there '_s no hope .
2	text and email received on sunday to say that parcel would be delivered between 0 . 00 - 00 . 00 on monday .
2	at 0 . 00 , there was a knock on the door .
2	exemplary service .
2	thank_you dpd .
2	if all courier companies were like this , life would be a lot_easier .
2	ordered a next working day delivery item for my holiday and specifically made arrangements to be in to receive it and then get an_email from evans telling_me that they have kindly refunded my delivery charge because this useless bunch of &^%^&$ can '_t even do their jobs - and not for the first time either .
2	i '_ve told evans i won_'_t be shopping with them again and if i see a delivery service that offers hermes as the courier , then i won_'_t bother .
2	i wish there was an offer of zero_stars as that '_s all this shambles of a company is worth .
2	great delivery service - pay for next_day and not only do you get what you pay for , you get tracking_information too .
2	as for their products , i am a repeat customer several_times over , and being a fussy so and so ( polite or what ?!
2	), that '_s high praise_indeed .
2	if their goods and services were rubbish , they would have been binned a long time ago .
2	if you ' re looking for chocolate products , especially for cake_decorating , don_'_t go_anywhere_else .
2	their cigarello '_s come with very few breakages and they are the best tasting too .
2	i love pet_supermarket .
2	as the elderly_mum of two 0 month_old indoor kittens , i couldn_'_t do without their support .
2	we use the worlds best cat_litter ( which is by the way !)
2	and buy the huge and heavy 00kilo sack every 0_weeks .
2	at my age there is no way i could carry that home from the supermarket , even if i could find somewhere locally that sells it .
2	when the soft food and iams kitten biscuits are on offer and cheaper_than my local_supermarket , which is very i buy them on line as well .
2	as shipping is so quick and reliable i don_'_t have to stockpile litter and food in the house , i just order 0_days before i need it .
2	thank_you psm , happy new year to you all
2	from pat and her two boys jeeves and wooster .
2	jet 0 are wonderful .
2	we flew with them 0 times this year and have never been disappointed .
2	they fly on time , with great crew .
2	always very freindly and helpful .
2	they are now our airline of choice .
2	i dont even bother looking at other_airlines on line .
2	well_done jet 0 you wil be seeing us again very soon .
2	after shopping at john_lewis it makes it difficult to shop at ordinary shops .
2	other seem tatty and old_fashioned compared to the lovely airy and modern layouts at jl .
2	always immaculate and with lovely staff to boot why would you shop elswhere ?
2	and they always have the best value .
2	i thought they would be expensive but found them to beat just about everybody else on price
2	used easyjet twice this year after many_years with other_airlines .
2	what a change in them . the cabin_crew are charming and helpful , the aircraft new and spotlessly_clean , even the flight deck crew chatted to us throughout the flight .
2	i am converted , i just wished you had flights to rome and pisa as well
2	top up £_00 and get £_00 free credit .
2	cant ask for more than that .
2	i am new to bullguard and not a techie but they have already helped_me out setting_up v00 .
2	after years with mcafee i am converted to bullguard . it is easy to use ( with the on line help ) and you feel in control .
2	also i got 0 licences for the price of one !
2	i '_ve known for ages that i could speed up my old_faithful but sluggish laptop by increasing its memory , but i was worried that it would go_wrong if i tried to do it myself .
2	well finally , i plucked_up the courage and found mr_memory '_s website ( among others ).
2	the scan feature was brilliant and recommended exactly the items i needed .
2	the price was competitive , so i went_ahead with the order .
2	i was then pleasantly_surprised to find that i could choose free first_class postage .
2	but i was feeling quite excited_about giving my laptop a boost , so i chose express despatch ( only 00p !
2	).
2	so , having first clicked_onto the mr_memory website at about 0 . 00pm on a friday , i managed to find what i needed , do couple of price_comparisons , check the installation process , eat some lunch and place my order within the hour - the memory arrived with the post about 00 on saturday and was installed and working perfectly by midday .
2	quick , painless and a massive boost to my laptop !!
2	thanks mr_memory !
2	a very good service .
2	the site is quick and easy to use in every_respect , the booking confirmations come through extremely quickly and the reviews / ratings seem reliable - everything you could wish for !
2	i notice the website for this company is ' under maintenance '.
2	i hope this means it will no_longer be used to take orders and money for furniture which will never be delivered or refunded .
2	i have been appalled to keep reading_reviews from others like me who are considerably out of pocket because of the unfair trading practices of the owner of this company .
2	day 0 : 0 . 00am ordered flowers for same day delivery to office address ( 0 . 00am email_confirmation of order ).
2	0pm delivery promised - £ 0 . 00 paid + £_00 for flowers .
2	0pm - no flowers .
2	email to customer service ......... nothing .
2	0pm leaves office with no flowers , having to stop at some florist to get flowers !!
2	another £_00 spend .
2	next evening reply from customer service that flowers had been delivered to security who had promised to see i got the flowers the next_day , as flowers delivered at 0 . 00pm .
2	wrote back and told customer service and demanding a full_refund as non - delivery is breech of contract .
2	of course have not heard_anything back for 0_days ..........
2	summary : don_'_t waste your time and money on same day delivery as it will become an expensive mistake as i ended_up paying nearly_£_00 for flowers in total .
2	never in my life experienced_such bad service or poor attitude .
2	buy anywhere_else and don_'_t trust the reviews - they are very selected and does not give a true picture .
2	they took my money and even_though i kept asking for the tickets they cancelled the day before .
2	these were tickets i had bought for my son and husband as a present .
2	they were extremely rude to me when i rang them and hung_up on me .
2	had to fight to get my money back .
2	only when my bank intervened did this happen .
2	i was left_feeling stressed and angry and stupid for having let myself fall for such a scam .
2	arena flowers have plenty of flowers to choose from for all occasions at reasonable_prices
2	after me trying for over an_hour to purchase tickets for michael_buble at manchester i was about to give up and then vgetmein popped_up at bottom of my laptop screen and i was able to purchase 0tickets for myself and a friend
2	i have used this website twice_now and i am very pleased with the choice it offers customers there are plenty of items to choose from and prices are very good too both my orders arrived in good time the goods were well_packaged and liked the offer of spend 00 pounds or more and get free delivery i will_definately use this website again
2	virgin_games is a good all_rounder , if you want to experience the thrill and fun of playing_bingo and slots .... i must_say they have by far the best selection of slots of any site , you can also play them in demo mode , so you can try them out before playing for cash to see which ones you prefer .
2	although you can win big , you must remember that you can also lose , but virgin_games allows for this by enabling you to put a cap on the amount you can deposit if you so wish , as it can be easy to get carried away as on all sites .
2	the chat_hosts are great and offer quizzes and media games allowing you to win some extra_cash , not forgetting the daily free game in which you can win cash , there is also a free monthly game too .
2	all in all i would not_hesitate to recommend virgin_games to anyone .
2	a very easy site to follow , with excellent instruction videos .
2	the goods were delivered swiftly and in good condition .
2	i would recommend this company to anyone , trade or diy
2	from ordering to delivery , it was all very simple .
2	very easy ti use and very fast payment !
2	i was very impressed with the speed the envelope arrived and payment was made the same day my phone was received !
2	highly_recommended !
2	bought a new filter but a part was broken in transit .
2	the company were good at sorting it out and sending a new part .
2	i have used serenata_flowers a few_times_now and never had any_problems .
2	i use them internationally for my family and friends in the uk and they always report how beautiful the flowers are .
2	prompt delivery too and definitely value for money .
2	i purchased some canned lilys_kitchen dog_food , it was well_packed , delivered promptly and i was well informed of the despatch details .
2	i would recommend pet_supermarket .
2	i booked a flight 0_weeks_ago with bravofly , within 0 / 0 hour i realised i had made a mistake with the time so phoned and cancelled the booking .
2	i was told ' no problem ' we will refund you asap but will be charged 00_euros for admin .
2	ok i said , that was acceptable even_though i had already been charged_£_00 ( 0 % for using credit_card )
2	i have phoned 0 times_now , ( calls are to switzerland ) each time i am told the refund is being_processed .
2	i have phoned the airline ( united airlines ) who have told me the flight was never charged to bravofly .......
2	so basically they have had my money for 0_weeks now , not had to pay for anything at all .
2	i have now put a claim into my credit_card company to get a refund .
2	i know it was my fault with the time mistake , but it does not take this long to rectify a problem .
2	dress is fabulous .
2	gorgeous colour and fits_perfectly .
2	lovin the skirt .
2	just the right length colour and fit .
2	awesome
2	ordered the necklace on sunday and it arrived on the tuesday_morning !
2	i got emails as well telling_me that the order had been dispatched and telling_me how to track it .
2	the necklace was as shown on website , beautifully_packaged and ready to send off to my friend in sweden .
2	perfect , thank_you !
2	abi & heather .
2	i found digitalrev . com on search_engine and bought purely on price ( which was excellent ).
2	normally i would check and double_check reviews before using new company but , thankfully , my lack of research was safe this time !
2	digitalrev provided an excellent service with fast secure delivery and faultless communications ,.
2	highly_recommended !!

2	it '_s a front for collecting money .
2	we also had a call where they volunteered to take the details from another website and gave_us a cheap offer .
2	we never had an enquiry as a result and they then took a full subscription from my credit_card for the following year .
2	if you do try and use the website to find a property the only search_criteria is by country !
2	absolutely useless .
2	who is goint to trawl pages of properties until the find the odd one or two that meet their criteria .
2	doesn_'_t bode well if you are listed on page 00 !
2	!
2	stay away from these
2	an easy to us website with a good range of frames at good prices .
2	easy to order and received within a week .
2	thanks for senidng me my items so quickly .
2	dedicated smokers / vapers will know how imporant that is .
2	i stumbled_across the supplement_warehouse website and discovered that they were substantially_cheaper on most of the items that i buy .
2	they were the same price on one of the pricier items .
2	i look_forward to reviewing their delivery time .
2	i only have one thing could gave been done better !!!!
2	after paying almost £_00 for connection i thought they would have turned the doors around on fridge_/_freezer !!!!
2	especially as my husband is recovering_from surgery after a new heart valve only a few_weeks_ago !!!
2	other than that wonderful service second to none !!!
2	!
2	love personalised items especially for grandchildren .
2	they don_'_t lose things so easily because they are easily_identified !!
2	!
2	bought a few electrical items from this company .
2	their service is second to none .
2	love the video of items for comparison .
2	availability and speed of delivery so quick !!
2	even when i no_longer needed an item because my old one started to work again they didn_'_t_hesitate to cancel my order .
2	not just cancelled but give me week incase mine gave up the ghost again !!!!
2	!
2	replaced item that had broken within couple of days - great service .
2	would certainly recommend .
2	thank_you .
2	i cannot_fault simply_games , have used a few online stores in the past for our video games , and although they start with a good service , for some reason the level of service decreases and we lose confidence in them .
2	we have decided that we will use simply_games for all our games in the future .
2	managed to lock myself out of my account , 0 minute on live_chat with catherine and all sorted .
2	you don_'_t get that kind of service every day .
2	many_thanks catherine .
2	it is so easy just to post requirements and wait .
2	the small company that i chose was efficient , turned_up on time and treated my stuff well .
2	they drove through all the bad march snow to deliver and were really nice to communicate with .
2	i couldn_'_t buy on ebay without this service .
2	thank_you
2	a fast response and turnaround to gain_access to this product and susanna was very helpful in setting_up our account .
2	very easy to use and would recommend this service / product to anyone .
2	we have had lots of villa_holidays in our time but villaplus truly provided a fabulous service .
2	the rep , kim was brilliant , sorting_out our wi_-_fi for us ( which was of vital importance to my kids !!)
2	we '_ve never been in a villa where the cleaners have come in and changed towels so often .
2	it was truly refreshing .
2	the villa inside and out was kept in excellent condition , pool was immaculate .
2	we are already looking to book with villaplus next year .
2	i ordered after the cut_off time for next_day delivery and i still received my item first thing the next_day .
2	highly impressed .
2	thank_you
2	i was delighted with the sunglasses i ordered .
2	they arrived really quickly and fitted_perfectly .
2	any_questions were answered straight_away by very friendly staff .
2	can '_t_believe_how great the prices are for top quality glasses .
2	i have already_recommended them to my friends and i will certainly order from them again .
2	excellent service with great communication .
2	i was kept_informed as to how my order was being_processed .
2	i have been searching websites to replace an old kilim for the last couple of years , and i was thrilled to come_across carpetvista .
2	the site offers an unparalleled selection of these carpets , and my experience is that the colour representation used is very accurate .
2	when ordered , service given in respect of information and delivery is exceptional - less_than 0_days from sweden to my door in scotland is pretty special in my experience .
2	and of course , the quality of the carpet supplied is excellent .
2	i just wonder_why it took me so long to find the website , when i was searching for " kilim ".
2	helpful pre_- sales technical info by phone .
2	order processed quickly and delivered next_day .
2	item easy to program with door code and works_fine .
2	would definitely recommend easygates to friends !
2	the aftercare staff are no help what so ever , i booked a car with rentalcars . com was told everything was covered , when i got to my desination i was chanrged another 000_euros , i have tried to call customer service and was told i had to email them , i received an_email back to be told they would contact me again within 00 days , very poor service do not use them unless you want to be ripped_off
2	i had a welding set to return to the shop i bought it from online .
2	i had missed the post by royal_mail so tried interparcel .
2	they collected the parcel from me within the hour , gave_me a tracking_number , so i saw that it was delivered and signed for the next_day .
2	and all for a third of the price quoted by royal_mail !
2	i cannot_fault the service i received and would certainly reccomend them to anyone .
2	i bought an outside led christmas_tree .
2	it is absolutely_beautiful .
2	festive_lights despatched it quickly , and i am delighted with it .
2	they had the cheapest products that i could find on the internet , and also there was a wide_choice .
2	so five_stars all_round !
2	fantastic quality and a very reasonable_price .
2	very helpful delivery men .
2	would happily_recommend .
2	i ordered items from this company on 00 / 0 /_0000 .
2	i received an_email with a tracking_number which stated that the items would be delivered in 0 to 0 working_days ( before the 0nd_july ).
2	i phoned the company on 00 / 0 /_0000 to get an update only to be told that the item was out of stock and had been when i ordered it .
2	i told them that this was not the case as i had booked tradesmen in around the delivery date and that i most certainly would not have ordered out of stock items .
2	i was then told that there had been problems with their website .
2	i asked to speak to a manager but hey_ho that would take 00hrs .
2	i asked why was this ?
2	did their managers not come into work ?
2	i was told they were always in a meeting .
2	this company are taking people '_s money for goods they do not have in stock .
2	i will be informing the trading_standards people about this .
2	needless to say i have asked for a refund which i am told will take 0 week .
2	meantime i will now have to go and buy my goods elsewhere , which i wish i had done in the first place .
2	with no time to run_out and buy flowers and worry_about getting parked etc this was a godsend .
2	the flowers were delivered to the venue and held until the function that evening .
2	the flowers were beautiful and were fresh .
2	the fact that they were boxed was great for the recipient taking them home as they were sealed in water .
2	this is a great service and i am just about to call to order another delivery .
2	thank_you
2	i can recommend chemist_direct , they have a fab web_page which is easy to use , the products are extensive and varied .
2	prices are fair and your have to pay postage , delivery is superb and i had my delivery within 0_days .
2	fully recommend chemist_direct to anyone_wanting to try them for the first time .
2	amazingly good value for money - this was the cheapest transfer i could find on the internet and definitely the best service we have ever received .
2	the driver was waiting for us at arrivals at dalaman with a name board .
2	there were 00 in our party so we had a whole minibus to ourselves - it was air_conditioned and very clean .
2	driver stopped off on the way so we could get some breakfast as we had arrived very early morning .
2	driver on the return transfer arrived early and we got to airport in plenty of time .
2	both drivers were very polite and helpful .
2	really cannot_fault this company !
2	highly_recommend !
2	very quick service weather you ring up or order on line .
2	prices are very competative .
2	at the beginning of february i ordered an urgently_needed twin pushchair for my grandchildren and chose kiddisave because their web_site stated the item was in stock and they use express delivery .
2	i waited a week and nothing arrived so sent them an_email asking for an_approximate delivery date .
2	the email went_unanswered .
2	i tried several_times to contact them by phone and on the one occasion they answered it i was immediately cut_off .
2	i sent a further email with my phone number which also went_unanswered .
2	after several more attempts on the phone i finally got to speak to customer_services who told me that the item was not in stock despite their web_site stating that it was and that the item would not be in stock until the end of february .
2	adding on delivery time meant that i would not receive the goods until march .
2	i told the assistant that i would have to cancel the order in that case as i needed to order it urgently from somewhere_else and she told me that i would not receive a refund for about 00 days despite the fact that they took the payment from my account the day after i ordered it .
2	i find this absolutely_appalling as i can '_t order another one until i receive the refund .
2	kiddisave need to get their act_together and be honest about what is in stock and what isn_'_t .
2	don_'_t they realise that baby goods are very often urgently_needed ?
2	they also need to improve their customer service by answering emails and at_least answering phone_calls .
2	i would not recommend this store to anyone .
2	just had a lovely few_days at the premier_inn at elgin , lovely rooms cosy beds , terrific staff , will go again
2	i have just used blackcircles for the first time and have to say that i was very impressed .
2	from booking on the website to having the tyre fitted was extremely easy and quick , good prices too .
2	i will most definitely be using them again .
2	the part i ordered came the next_day and the company kept me informed at all times when delivery would be .
2	absolutely fantastic day at wimbledon and arranged without_any effort on my part by tom .
2	felt that everything was taken_care of , my phone_call were returned within minutes , tickets arrived when they said they would etc .
2	etc .
2	faultless service will_definately use again .
2	have used mazuma before , so knew would be excellent .
2	not the best price for my phone , but reliable & quick .
2	the quality of the goods and service are second to none , would highly_recommend this company to everyone i know .
2	simpleswim have an excellent selection of swim_wear with a wide_range of prices from budget to luxury .
2	their range is backed by a very fast delivery service - i ordered an in stock item which was delivered the following_morning .

2	the customer service staff were very helpful , i had found a slightly better rate on another site and after confirming this they locked the rate for me and i was able to order the better rate with them .
2	money arrived the next_day , really excellent service .
2	i recommend this company to a friend after buying our ottoman base from them .
2	she ordered an ottoman base and mattress .
2	both were confirmed for delivery but only the base arrived at 00 . 00 .
2	my friend was advised to ring the company but they had shut at 0000 .
2	my friend is 00 and spent the night in the chair .
2	she rang the following_morning and was advised that 0 other mattresses had been mislaid but they would get back to her .
2	she rang again at lunch_time and was advised the mattress had gone to another warehouse but would be delivered the following_tuesday due to the easter_weekend .

2	and probably some instruments too when i need them !

2	the choice of equipment is good .
2	the speed of delivery is one of the best we have come_across and has always been accurate .
2	we are in the process of returning a faulty hockey_stick .
2	as a supplier the staff have been helpful and encouraging regarding this and apply the same standard of service as they do to purchases .
2	so much_easier than old calling , no_pressure and you are in control .
2	all communication via_email so you can have time to think before you choose the company .

2	would definately recommend anyvan .
2	om carriers were friendly , reliable , helpful , professional and could not do enough .
2	they even did a second run and turned_up with more men than i asked for .

2	would def recommend om carriers to all
2	we bought the corona pine bedroom set .
2	the furniture ( now its finally up ) is lovely , however when we got to the final piece , someone in the packing department had packed the wrong accessories unit , so we didnt have the right screws , nails etc to assemble the furniture .
2	not best pleased at the end of a very long day !
2	i phoned the customer service dept and was told a new pack would be out to me within 0 working_days - fabulous - but after making a little_bit more of a fuss , someone managed to get the pack out to us 0_days_later .
2	no apologies given until i asked for one !

2	amazing thickness and a great price .
2	have looked around for similar and found they were either a lot thinner or much more_expensive .

2	i have just bought a new washer_dryer from 000 electrical and the service has_been fantastic .
2	i placed an order on line on tuesday and the washer_dryer was delivered on thursday .
2	000 kept in touch by text and phone_calls to let_me know when the washer_dryer would be delivered and even gave a 0 hour time_slot .
2	the delivery men were really helpful , phoned when they were half an_hour away and easily got up some awkward steps at the front of my house that other delivery drivers have ' huffed ' about .
2	all the other_retailers i researched for the same product were not only more_expensive but could not deliver for at_least 0_weeks !
2	it is really refreshing to deal with a company that can do what it promises and puts the service offered by the big companys , particularly currys , to shame !
2	i will certainly use 000 next time i need something electrical .
2	excellent value for money hotel in good location for downtown and georgetown where there are many restaurants within walking_distance of the hotel .
2	rooms are very spacious and hotel is definitely a 0_star quality .
2	i live in hull so i don_'_t have a lot of choices maybe one day i ll have the same as everybody else

2	i was very nervous_about applying for indefinite leave to remain as my original entry into the uk was delayed by a month and i had lot lot of travel ( for work ) out of the country .
2	i also needed my passport back immediately .
2	ali , whom i spoke to first and accompanied me on the day was very helpful , knowledgeable and calm .
2	because he spends a lot of time at the offices of the border agency , he knew how everything works ( and everyone it seemed ), all the short cuts and was the first to congratulate me !
2	i felt like i had a friend in this very scary world of residence applications .
2	tanwar , who was my senior case_worker gave_me all_kinds of tips on how to make_sure that i comply to the rules , gave_me all the advice and templates i needed as well as the re - assurance when that was needed .
2	they organised the appointment on a day suitable to me and kept all their promises .
2	i highly_recommend them

2	have to say that this companies quality and service exceeded all expectations .
2	this is not your standard garden_furniture , it is so comfortable and far_superior to anything_else we found available
2	to satisfy my sister '_s request to make bramble cocktails - having tasted them at a posh westbourne grove cocktail joint - during our stay cation in devon ... mission creme_de meur was launched .
2	special agent ' thedrinkshop . com ' delivered - overnight - ready for her arrival .
2	the delivery man may not have been daniel craig or tom cruise ... but the brambles were delicious shaken and stirred with colour co -_ordinated straws .
2	picture of them on the last sunny day we are likely to have for a while - on request .
2	they taste just as good in the rain .
2	will need to order a couple more bottles much sooner_than_expected !
2	0 for the london bar and 0 for the devon bar ... p . s .
2	if you can arrange for daniel craig to drop them in ( olympic stylee ) when i place the next order you could get a 0th ' gold ' star .
2	thank_you ... over and out !
2	really helpful on phone , easy on line , great customer service .
2	delivered next_day - perfect product .
2	highly_recommended .
2	excellent product information .
2	we bought a fridge_freezer this time .
2	the video '_s and detailed_information with each product helped_us make our decision from the overwhelming choice available .
2	the order process was no_fuss , the delivery information accurate and we were kept_informed every_step of the way .... although getting a phone_call at 0am with delivery information on a saturday was a bit of a shock ha - ha .
2	it was great that they were able to deliver on a saturday so we didn_'_t have to take time off .
2	our old fridge_/_freezer was taken_away and recycled ( extra_cost though ).
2	we can thoroughly_recommend appliances onlines - we wouldn_'_t buy our appliances anywhere_else ( watch out though for appliances direct - they look very similar but are much more_expensive !
2	i purchased a reebok treadmill from sweatband .
2	the order process , payment , despatch and delivery went very smoothly .
2	delivery was very well_organised with a two hour time_slot .
2	unfortunately the treadmill didn_'_t work when it arrived .
2	these things_happen so i first tried getting in touch with reebok to resolve the issue .
2	after 0_days i was getting no - where so i contacted sweatband .
2	michal and mike from sweatband bent_over_backwards to get my issue resolved .
2	they were in constant_touch keeping_me updated .
2	reebok were an_absolute_nightmare so sweatband replaced the machine with a kettler ( which they recommended ).
2	i am extremely happy with it and i received the price difference as a refund very promptly .
2	i would definitely recommend buying from sweatband , lovely people - i have never known customer service like it !
2	i bought a kitting tote_bag , which was exactly as_described online .
2	am really pleased with it .
2	the service i received was excellent , so i have no_hesitation in highly recommending gur_sewing_machines . i will definitely be back .
2	this is the second time we have used hotel_direct , excellent service , really friendly .
2	they helped_me resolve a problem i had when i made a mistake with the dates i chose , even_though by rights they could have made me stick to the original date , or lose money .
2	the hotel they were recommending was absolutely excellent , beautifully clean , friendly helpful staff , really lovely food .
2	we cannot_praise hotel_direct enough .
2	we will definitely be using them again .
2	highly_recommend them to you .
2	i ordered " digestion calming drops " ( weleda ) from natures_healthbox and the parcel arrived_safely within the time that the company stated it would .
2	the product is excellent - a great help to me as i have always had a delicate digestive_system and these drops remedy any disturbance in my gut quickly and thoroughly .
2	i would definitely recommend both the product and the suppler to anyone .
2	i have just bought my husband his third lambswool v - neck cardigan
2	from wool_overs .
2	he now has them in bottle green , wine red and beige / oatmeal colours , they launder perfectly and look attractive .
2	also , they are very reasonably_priced and are delivered promptly .
2	i have also recently bought a lovely pale_pink sleeveless top made from silk and cotton - perfect for the wonderful warm weather i '_m experiencing in devon .
2	it laundered very well and i look_forward to wearing it again soon !
2	i have never had a moment '_s problem with my o0 phone !
2	mine is a simple one as i only want it for making and receiving phone_calls and texts .
2	being an only child , and having lived on my own at certain times of my life , i appreciate having knowing that i can now be connected easily to everyone else .
2	at the same time , i don_'_t get too many cold calls and have never had a real nuisance call .
2	then there are the frequent competitions , which are fun , the prizes often being free calls - which are always welcome .
2	easy booking at the best price !
2	i have been using this company now for a few_years .
2	i love the up to date information , from letting you know your order was dispatched , and when it was delivered .
2	very reasonably_priced , but no economy with the quality of flowers or service !
2	just recieved information from the hotel i booked with budgetplaces . com that they had been booked up for over a month !!!
2	i now have to find another hotel , and battle to get my deposit back !
2	!
2	this is the second time in a week of ordering something from this site so happy with the first item and how fast it came .
2	quality is exactly_what it says on the descriptions .
2	very satisfied_customer
2	highly_recommend allbeauty . com - have used them quite a few_times and always found their prices and service to be excellent .
2	i wanted an item that had disappeared from their website and they were happy to email me as soon as they had it back in stock .
2	always the first place i check when buying cosmetics / perfumes for myself or presents .
2	really pleased they changed their name as always thought ' cheapsmells ' was not a good name !
2	i have used terry '_s fabrics a couple of times in the past and been very pleased with the fabrics but this time they surpassed themselves !
2	placed quite a large order in the evening and then realised in the morning that i had left off the vitally important curtain hooks .
2	rang to find the order had already been processed but they found a way to add the hooks to the parcel and even sent them with their compliments .
2	order delivered promptly by yodel and now all i have to do is make the curtains this week before christmas .
2	well_done terry '_s i shall be back !
2	didn_'_t receive the voucher_code deduction at checkout and the free gifts specified didn_'_t arrive !
2	however , the items i ordered were received by me the next_day .
2	i do wish simply_supplements would specify the size of their products though .
2	i have ms and as a result i have problems with swallowing .
2	the size of the information print is ridiculously small and the products really should come with a leaflet in my opinion .
2	i can '_t rate utilities warehouse highly_enough .
2	our combined energy and telephony charges have gone down so much .
2	you get great value and their website is incredibly easy to follow !
2	have a look at them for yourself .
2	our computer repair chap recommended utilities warehouse and we haven_'_t looked back !
2	unbeatable products at unbeatable prices accompanied_by unbeatable service !!
2	what more can you ask for ?
2	" the bed_linen is always of excellent quality and so sumptuous .
2	the duvets are great .
2	i have the cotton one for summer months and the goose_down one for the winter_months .
2	i recently bought some of the lightweight towels and they are way less bulky and easier to manage than bath sheets at the pool ."
2	just had shopping delivered and yes part of it has not arrived again .
2	this time i made the poor delivery guy check what was missing ie 0 items not a happy_bunny what is it with asda they can '_t get any delivery right .
2	so i ’_m waiting for a call back as if that ’_s all i have to do is wait around .
2	the last delivery was the same and it took two_weeks to get the goods i had ordered plus numerous_calls .
2	no apology from the store , no gratitude gift for the length of time it took but at_least they had taken my money .
2	then we go to the subs none hay_fever tabs none sent but they stated they has subbed it where .
2	richmond thick sausages they sent richmond ’_s skinless thin .
2	lwenbru beer sent tubor crap beer .
2	i ’_m defo not a happy shopper maybe time to change provider i ’_m sick of no apologises and the fact the mess up so often .
2	once or twice in a year is poor but nearly every shop is total unacceptable now i know what it means by cheap is not always the best .
2	sorry this is so long but to highlight the comedy of errors i have to endure and to ensure you know how bad the company is i have added what all happened me and what i did .
2	please take time to read it peeps

2	dear_sir / madam
2	ref_: customer number ( number removed )
2	good evening ,
2	rather_than phone you yet again about the order i have just received , i have e_- mailed you .
2	i received my order ( num removed ).
2	as usual we have had substitutes and yet again they have not been amended as ordered this is getting a regular_occurrence .
2	this time we ordered 0x 00cl x 00 lowenbru original lager total bottles 00
2	we received 0 x 0x00cl lowenbru original lager and 00 0x00cl pernoi lager total bottles 00 ( please_note i had put lowenbru original beer on the original e_- mail and had not changed the substitute as pernoi ).
2	price was the same but quantity less by 0 boxes of 0 .
2	so i have paid the same for less this meaning i have ended_up paying the same for a lesser_amount this is not what your substitute service offer states .
2	i have only just started to check the amount spent to quantity since i had lenor delivered and realise later the amount i paid i was a nearly a litre down on quantity .
2	also where is the 0x0lt bacardi that i ordered is clearly on your delivery notice but hasn ’_t been delivered , i have received the glava and bushmills but no bacaardi ?
2	we purchased these items when there on special and in this case to put away for xmas .
2	so by giving me the money back it in three or four days this is not suitable as your offer may have expired .
2	how can so many errors be made every time ?
2	do i have to check the whole delivery on arrival before the driver leaves this is ridiculous i am not happy as you can_imagine .
2	i ’_m_sure you have a list of various other errors i have phoned about before that is why i have chosen to write so as to keep a log of errors .
2	as i have no_intention of sitting on the phone for ages to clear this matter up again , costing me more money and time please either contact me on my home line ( tel num removed ) or by return e_- mail .
2	my preference in this matter would be for you to deliver the items as i did pay for them and for a full delivery service anyway .
2	thank_you
2	called customer service team on wednesday 00 : 00 was told they had called the store and they would be in touch with me .
2	i accepted this as except the call within the next 00_hours .
2	called the customer service team on friday 00 : 00 was told they had rung the store on thursday and spoke to ( name_removed ) who was to ring me .
2	i have not had any call back from tony or the customer service team to tell me what was happening .
2	i asked to speak with the supervisor as was not happy regarding the period of time it has taken to sort this bearing in mind we have paid for the said goods .
2	( name_removed ) stated after a few_minutes that the manager was unavailable at this time but she would contact the store again .
2	when i asked how much longer i was expect to wait for this to be dealt_with ie today a week , a month .
2	she just stated she didn_’_t know .
2	i then asked for a copy of the companies policy of complaints_procedure to be e_- mailed me and the reply was she was unable to do this .
2	i explained that this should be available to the customer if requested so she then stated she would ask her manager .
2	this document should be available to all customer service staff as it should state the time limit to reply to any complaints also stating a limit for the complaint to be dealt_with .
2	as i have had to chase this up myself the time limits i must assume have not been adhered .
2	due to the delays ( bad customer service ) and the fact that this is not the first_instance we have had to complain .
2	call returned by cs at 00 : 00 missed the call ( phone was on charge in my kitchen ) so i phoned back at 00 : 00 spoke with ( name_removed ) and he has informed me that ( name_removed ) team_leader at the store will be calling me tomorrow .
2	when i asked why he has not taken the time to call me today i was informed that they could not deliver today and when they sorted the routes out tomorrow they will ring me and let_me know what is happening .
2	i asked why i had not been refunded as i requested in my last phone_call i was told to wait for the call from the store .
2	monday and i have finally received the missing goods .
2	another delivery wrong .
2	new delivery sunday 00 dec_0000
2	delivery arrived just after 0pm as requested .

2	the adsa non drowsy hayfever / allergy 00 pk x 0 which had been substituted but had not been sent .
2	the driver tried to telephone the store but couldn ’_t get through .
2	he asked was if i available all day when he returned to the store he would get it dealt_with and would return with the said items .
2	by 0 : 00 i still had not received the goods or a call from the store to inform_me to what was happening .
2	i then tried to ring the customer service team starting from 0 : 00 .
2	i was on hold for 00 . 00_min then i was cut_off .
2	i rang straight back and again after 00mins was cut_off this carried on till i decided enough was enough and stopped calling at 00 : 00_hours .
2	as of 0 : 00 on the 00 december_0000 i still have had no contact from the store i started to ring the customer service team .
2	finally i was answered at 00 : 00 by ( name_removed ).
2	i explained what had happened and she stated she would get in touch with the store and asked them to ring me back .
2	i stated that i wanted a call today and that i wasn_’_t prepared to wait a week again for my shopping .
2	she assured me that it would be sorted today .
2	00 : 00 00 december 000 .
2	(. name_removed ) from the customer service contact centre phoned me to state he had spoken to ( name_removed ) one of the managers at the telford store .
2	unfortunately they are unable to deliver the missing goods so would we accept a refund bearing in mind we paid for delivery for all the goods in question .
2	no apology , no telephone_call from the store nothing .
2	believe me this is the last time i will ever use the store again and i will be putting this account of errors on the review sites as well as face book etc .
2	it took less_than 0_days from sending the phones to receiving the full payment as stated on line .
2	we were informed by email of every_stage of the process .
2	this is our second time using this company and it will not be the last .
2	a big_pat on the back for speed and excellent customer_care .
2	dissapointing result , sorry .
2	the parcel arrived on time and in perfect_condition

2	i have used holidaysplease on two occasions now , first time for a very upmarket holiday in the maldives , second time for a simple family holiday at a caravan park in the uk .
2	each time i have received wonderful service , no question ever too much_trouble and very personalised .
2	particular thanks and appreciation to jenny .
2	it '_s impossible to redeem wowcher despite_emailing wowcher for help .

2	no i now wake refreshed , thank_you mattressman , keep_up the good service and products , j g .
2	i '_ve_used my hermes for sending birthday and christmas parcels to my family for some time now , ever_since royal_mail put their prices up to a ridiculous high .
2	i tell everyone i know about myhermes .
2	now even the lady in our local post_office uses myhermes to send her own parcels and our village supermarket has_become an agent for drop_offs and returns since i sang your_praises to the owner .
2	i intend to keep_up the good work as long as you do .
2	order more as they let you see out but also give privacy
2	very pleased nice to no what time parcel coming came right on time no hanging_around waiting
2	very bad no refund still from 00th_march good luck to anyone_else do not order
2	great reliable company . i would not use anyone_else for our holidays now . i also book the holidays for all our families . thankyou travel_republic . nothing to change as i still use travel_republic for all my and my family holidays . a great site to use .
2	never bought from these before but can highly_recommend . very quick free delivery no_problems at all thank_you ..
2	i '_ve_used ebay for several_years .
2	around half of the items i have trouble with , several never came and paypal were a pain to get the money back .
2	too risky on the whole to use .
2	i love tesco , i feel their customer service is great compared to the other main supermarkets and their prices are generally pretty good .
2	no_complaints from me .
2	i have placed a few orders over the last 0 years and have found the delivery to be very efficient .
2	they send out items that are in stock immediately then anything outstanding is followed .
2	returns service also very good , with immediate_refund where neccessary .
2	very friendly on the phone too .
2	searched for suitable boots and best price found these , good price and fast delivery can '_t fault recommend any time they are brill boots meet description really comfy !
2	first_tutors charges less introductory fees than other_websites and it allows students to leave reviews that can be added to your profile , which is really good backup for your profile .
2	very easy to sign up and use .
2	when you get an_email_saying a student has sent a message you click on the on the work " here " and you are taken straight to the message ... no further singing in with user name and password as the site is linked to the emails they send .
2	i am really happy with this website , it has provided me with more students than i can tutor .
2	also it '_s really easy to amend your profile .
2	during very busy_periods you can even put your price up !
2	excellent website , service and delivery time .
2	i would recommend viovet to everyone .
2	i also enjoy the regular email_updates often with very helpful tips for dog_owners !
2	tried several_times to order one wardrobe and one chest of drawers from argos but the page just hung and i didn_'_t receive any confirmation - well not until i received 0 emails from them confirming 0 orders for the same thing - and they had taken the money from my credit_card !
2	ouch !
2	contacted them immediately and gave all order details and told my account would be credited within 00 days ?
2	hmm .. they can take my money immediately but drag their feet to re - credit !
2	several phone_calls later i received a part - refund and eventually ( 0_months later !!!)
2	received the remainder - even then i had to go in to one of the stores for a credit - i will never book a home delivery with them again !
2	have shopped with sainsbury '_s online for a few_years_now and they have never let_me down .
2	they give 0 hour slots and 00_% of the time arrive within this time - in the event they are a few_minutes late they have given me a " late voucher " to use online - to the value of £_00 . 00 !
2	great !
2	the goods arrive well - packed and separated into different bags for individual products so that the frozen foods are together and meat products etc .
2	they also do a recycling service for your old carrier_bags and the driver will take them away .
2	the products ' picked ' in - store usually have at_least a 0 day shelf_life or the freshest date possible - so all in all can '_t grumble .
2	will_continue to shop with them online - it takes the hassle out of taxis or struggling with bags on the bus .
2	don_'_t book a food delivery with them - i did .
2	they operate 0 hour slots ( allegedly ).
2	booked a delivery for a sunday expecting a roast for sunday lunch - delivery between 0pm and 0pm - at 0pm i got a call saying they couldn_'_t make it ( after being_fobbed_off on the phone & no lunch ).
2	i was promised a delivery for the day after at 0pm .. they turned_up at 0 . 00pm - substituted cheese and onion crisps with salt and vinegar - like they couldn_'_t switch a brand_name for their own !
2	very poor - even complained to their head_office who were totally dismissive - so they lost my custom .
2	i '_ll stick to sainsburys - never had a problem with them .
2	i have had some terrific bargains from amazon and a regular_shopper with them .
2	if buying directly from them they do operate a free delivery service which overall is excellent - occasionally they didn_'_t get the packaging quite right - sometimes too_big or small but they always ask for feedback to improve their services .
2	rarely had to contact customer_services but on the occasions i have , they have been quick to come_back to me and resolve any_queries .
2	never had any_problems with them and would recommend .
2	delivery was great however , flowers received could have been a better arrangement considering it was a small gift bag - disappointed !
2	brilliant service .
2	ordered my sister '_s favourite_perfume for xmas and received within a few_days .
2	will definitely use again .
2	just had 0 new bridgestone_tyres so please with the service sam was extremely polite and helpful would recommend tyres on the drive to anybody .
2	cheapest price i could find anywhere bridgestone fitted for the same price as budget tyres anywhere_else .
2	i booked and flew with jet0 for the first time to mallorca and back .
2	i had read some poor reviews and a little reluctant to choose jet0 , but having been disappointed ( and squeezed into my seat ) with monach and with easyjet prices being higher ; i decided to give jet0 a try .
2	the plane was large , spacious , clean and comfortable .
2	the staff were friendly and helpful both on the ground and in the air .
2	i upgraded to extra legroom seats at the airport for no extra_cost than had i booked before hand online .
2	i was also surprised how low the prices were for sandwiches and drinks on board .
2	we ordered a bottle of champagne at a great price .
2	the flight was on time , and all in all my partner and i were genuinely impressed .
2	i will definitely fly with them again ; especially at the low price we paid .
2	great hairpiece i can just put my own hair up in a ponytail then clip on ponytail attachment , hair looks great !
2	villa rudi , cala_d ' or
2	on a plus note the outside of the villa was beautiful and well_maintained , and the views were lovely .
2	and the resort was stunning and clean .
2	unfortunately when first entering our villa our opinion was of disappointment .
2	there was a very unpleasant musty smell .
2	we appreciate that the humid heat does not help .
2	but surely you should be used to this and deal with nasty odours ’ accordingly .
2	the inside of cupboards , wardrobes and drawers all had the horrid smell , so had to be left open for days .
2	i '_m_sure many of them are not used and left empty , in this case they should still be cleaned and dusted inside regularly to avoid nasty odours .
2	the whole villa desperately_needed updating , especially the bathrooms .
2	they felt grubby and dated , especially the stained shower curtains and the thick dust on top of the mirrors .
2	shower curtains can be replaced for an extremely low_cost , and the fact that they had not been replaced for the season just goes to show how little you think of the comfort of your clients .
2	the dishwasher was diabolical , it run for approximately 0 and half hours and the dishes were still not properly clean .
2	it was in a bad state of disrepair and needs to be changed .
2	the tap in the utility_room needs changing , it fell_off on use , and i got drenched !
2	the sofas were very grubby , we could not sit on them without towels .
2	again they need replacing .
2	our rep . sally was efficient but i found her unfriendly and uptight .
2	most reps . are usually cheery and friendly .
2	she spoke very rapidly and seemed as if she just couldn ’_t wait to deal with us and move on .
2	it just made us feel very undervalued as clients of yours .
2	maybe she was just having a bad day !
2	also , you need to make it clear that we are supposed to pay extra and book our own seats for the flights .
2	my husband and i are very used to doing this , being frequent travellers .
2	we did think about doing it but there was no obvious link ?
2	so we assumed that villa_plus had carried_out this task .
2	arriving very early at luton , after little sleep and being told that our 0 year_old had to sit on his own with strangers , was not a good
2	start to our family holiday .
2	a hire_car was arranged through avis , we only had around 0 people in the queue in front on us but the wait was still well over an_hour .
2	we arrived on the 00th_july but the queues were much longer the following saturday when we dropped the car off .
2	friends of ours have stayed in your villas and been happy , but obviously for some reason you do not have the same standards in all your villas ?
2	we came away feeling sorry for the next family who had to endure the inside of this villa .
2	my husband and i are desperately_trying to put it down as a bad_experience , and are trying to just forget about the villa .
2	i believe i ordered the product , and it was with me almostby return post i was kept_informed as to the progress by informed emails .
2	i '_ll use them again

2	?
2	parcel picked_up from north of scotland on the monday and arrived in cyprus on the friday .
2	excellent service
2	i will use them again as they were very competitive with price .
2	this beanbag has_been used almost constantly since it arrived .
2	the shape i chose is just right for a lounge and a snooze .
2	the colour_matches my living_room decor and it '_s not so big that it takes up all the floor space i am really pleased i got it .
2	the garden_bench i ordered was delivered well within time and it is just as_described online .
2	i am very happy with the whole_transaction
2	great customer service , good product base .
2	delivery comes on date given .
2	and a continual update be email to keep you informed of progress .
2	ideal supplier !!
2	!
2	i have used amazon on numerous_occassions and always received excellent customer service .
2	even when something has_gone awrey they resolve things in an efficient yet caring manner and pull out every stop to make things_happen .
2	amazon is truly 0_* in my view !
2	as a first time customer i ordered one item on a next_day delivery basis on 00th_october ......
2	i am still_waiting !
2	i was informed that the courier had the item on 00st_october and first the courier claimed they could not access the house ( its on the main_road and has a wide driveway easily_accessed by all other couriers ) which was then changed to the house could not be found - there are only a handful of properties with the same postcode all next to each other , then it was changed that the courier would contact me directly to arrange delivery - that was over a week_ago and surprise , surprise that did not happen .
2	i have paid on the 00 / 0 for my item and also paid for delivery - yet isme is doing nothing to get my item delivered to me !!!
2	!
2	will not be recommending isme to family , friends , colleagues - in fact quite the opposite .
2	isme you have no customer service !
2	meg kent worcestershire

2	always have everything i needs and super_fast delivery .
2	have shopped with the company for 0 / 0 years_now and have always been really pleased with their pricing and excellent customer service .
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending them .
2	have used half a dozen_times or more and always received orders very quickly .
2	prices are very competitve too , so always my first call when looking to reorder food for my five dogs .
2	packaging used protects food during_transport which is my top_priority .
2	the service is great , the people are great , even with people like me who don_'_t know what they are talking_about !!!

2	i will be recommending it to all the students i know .
2	thankyou .
2	excellent service , before i new it it was here , fantastic , ill be back .
2	i '_m so glad that i found wowcher with offers which are not too true to believe - i have been able to buy things for myself and my family i wouldn_'_t otherwise have been able to afford .
2	i look_forward to finding out each day what is on offer - useful , essential or just must - havable !
2	and ...
2	i know from experience that any_problems or queries i have are dealt_with in a friendly , efficient , speedy way .
2	my grandsons don_'_t want nan to buy them jumpers or sweeties !
2	they want to add to their stash of cash and vouchers collected from friends and relatives at christmas .
2	at_least i know they '_ll get something they really want !
2	brilliant fast efficient service .
2	product really great .
2	particularly_liked the web based instructions for fitting .
2	as was able to know how to fit when blinds arrived saving time .
2	well_packaged to avoid dammage .
2	this is a brilliant service .
2	i will be ordering more .
2	i am so glad i found this company .
2	i found them when researching mattresses for my b_& b .
2	i was so impressed with their website and their information that i rang and spoke to a very nice woman_who gave_me all the advice i could have wanted in choosing a mattress .
2	i settled on the superking origins_pocket 0000 and every_single guest has_commented on what a fabulous bed it is .
2	since then , my daughter has bought the same one and loves it .
2	recently , for my rental_property , i have bought a memory_foam_mattress from their new division .
2	this is a great new direction for john_ryan .
2	my reason for a memory_foam_mattress was it was a little cheaper for rental than the origins_pocket and because it has a removable and replaceable topper .
2	this is a brilliant idea and saves the mattress - an important consideration for rentals .
2	the bonus is it is so comfortable .
2	we have been using it while we refurbish the property and it is wonderful to sleep on .
2	not too hot , like many memory_foam mattresses and not too soft .
2	it really is perfect and i am so pleased .
2	i am very fussy and have a vi - spring for my own use ( which will be replaced when tired with a john_ryan artisan ) so for me to be able to report that i am happy to sleep on it is a real accolade .
2	my younger daughter has since bought one ( different firmness ) and is very , very happy with it .
2	so four beds bought by us all in all so i would say satisfaction is 000_% and you really can '_t beat the customer service either .
2	talk to lee if you want memory_foam .
2	he is so helpful and takes into_consideration your weight and any concerns you might have in terms of support etc .
2	they seem cheaper_than most other_suppliers and the product arrives promptly and well_wrapped .
2	what i liked most is that i got an_email to tell me that i still had a valid prescription for my dog and when it ended .
2	i am pretty sure i will only be using this company from now on .
2	as it arrived very quick the chilly powder a super hot just how the family like it order gluten_free flour made great bread with my bread_maker
2	easy purchase , delivered when they said and fast !
2	pleasant delivery men .
2	made spending money a pleasure
2	the outfit was ideal for our fancy_dress_party and fitted well .
2	material was a but thin , but for the price , it was value for money .
2	used the bybox method of delivery .
2	this was excellent .
2	delivered within the timescale , and received both an_email and text as soon as it was ready for pick_up .
2	would highly_recommend .
2	booked online and the confirmation_email didn_'_t come through .
2	took over a week for someone to sort_out the day before_departure !
2	arrival at dalaman was ok , there were only 0 of us travelling seeing as it was out if season in april .
2	did the usual stop off at some tacky transport cafe for a ' comfort break '.
2	got into the resort and the driver who spoke very little english asked us where are accommodation was !
2	luckily we had been there before and we ended_up giving him directions .
2	confirming the pick_up online was useless , the time was not posted in the timescales advised .
2	tried_emailing , but got no reply .
2	eventually time was posted earlier the same day .
2	waited and waited , phoned the emergency_number , only to be asked for directions !
2	then they said it would be half an_hour .
2	the driver had clearly not left yet .
2	when we were eventually picked_up an_hour late , we were shuttled to marmaris where the driver drive around several back streets looking for another minibus , where we had to get off ours and change to the other .
2	we were greeted_by a bus load of unhappy passengers who had also been waiting an_hour to be picked_up .
2	the driver then asked us what time our flight was !
2	he should have known this !
2	when he realised how late it was , he thankfully put his foot down and drive directly to the airport without stopping at the tacky transport cafe !
2	i suppose you get what you pay for , but next time we '_ll be giving this company a miss !
2	don_'_t bother with this company .
2	i only wish i had looked out for the reviews before i used them .
2	after non delivery of flowers despite their online tracking_system informing_me that they had been delivered , it took them thirteen days to respond .
2	they stated that " we have a backlog of messages which requires response ".
2	yes i bet they do .
2	looking at these reviews it '_s clear that i '_m far from being alone in my bad_experience .
2	to add_insult to injury , the rest of the email ( do these people never actually talk to their customers ?)
2	was the usual marketing ( yeah_right !
2	they wouldn_'_t know marketing if it hit them in the face ) bulls ...
2	i quote ...
2	" we deeply value your relationship with iflorist and are committed to providing you with the highest_level of service simply because our customers deserve the very best ."
2	shame it '_s just words .
2	don_'_t waste your money or your time using these people .
2	complete amateurs and lazy to boot .
2	having decided to part with my dearly beloved canon_eos 00d and a tamron zoom lens i first tried gumtree .
2	well that was a disaster .
2	i had dozens of responses per day , everything from nigerian scammers to 00 year_old dreamers , plus some incredibly stupid offers .
2	i took it off gumtree and went into a corner to sulk for a while .
2	i then found mpb_photographic via a quick google_search , read the feedback and decided that getting a quote wasn_'_t going to hurt .
2	i was offered a very fair price for the equipment , and they sent a courier to collect it .
2	the whole_process was extremely professional , friendly , easy and fair .
2	the camera was collected on a wednesday_afternoon , receipt confirmed on the thursday and the money in my account on friday .
2	i will absolutely buy my next camera from them , too !
2	i am very impressed and very happy , and would recommend mpb_photographic to anyone .
2	great company to deal with !
2	no_reservations at all !!
2	thanks !
2	great service , quick and easy to order and the flowers were of great quality .
2	would order from this company again .
2	extremely happy with my canon lx0 and the excellent service provided .
2	very quick delivery .
2	wow , i was excited to find just what we needed , with more than one choice for each supplement !
2	great prices , easy navigation , fast checkout ... and i can '_t wait for some super freebies supplementwarehouse offered !
2	i was very happy with dialaflight .
2	they did everything for me .
2	all i had to do was make payment .
2	great customer service .
2	no_hidden_extras .
2	i will definitly be using this service again .
2	very very happy .
2	contacted emma and within a few seconds i received a response to my query .
2	excellent service .
2	will use again .
2	many_thanks
2	fantasically quick service .
2	delivery was well_packed and left in a safe placed , as advised .
2	it even waterproofed , just_incase the great british_weather got to it .
2	a0 firm xxx
2	animed_direct is a really good for any pet / animal_owners / lovers to use .
2	it has a wide_choice of any needs or wants you may have for your pets and at remarkabley good prices .
2	once you try them , im_sure you wont_be using anyone_else .
2	a0 rating by me !
2	fast and prompt friendly service , fantastic value for money , goods arrived the next_day , would definitely recommend .
2	very good quality food , well priced and quick delivery
2	items were delivered quickly and all as expected .
2	great value and lovely product .
2	was kept_informed every_step of the way with emails and tracked delivery .
2	recommended !
2	i ordered a generator from this company , the website looked good and genuine .
2	i received an_email after the order confirming the purchase .
2	the order was marked as pending .
2	the generator did not arrive .
2	i have tried contacting them to ask for a refund .
2	the phone line goes straight to answerphone , the customer support chatline is always offline and they do not answer the emails .
2	if you place an order with them , do not expect to receive anything .
2	they come under a company called anglo_pacific trading ltd .
2	avoid them .
2	ordered a pair of tyres for a land_rover .
2	the price was marginally better_than theyir competitor .
2	0_weeks_later and no tyres have arrived .
2	customer_services take up to 0 hours to respond , they have so far fobbed me off with :
2	i '_ll get you a tracking_number ... that was 0_days ago .
2	yesterday , the same ; i '_ll email you a tracking_number .
2	heard_nothing again , now it '_s the weekend so we will be into next week before any developments .
2	i have asked to cancel the order and refund the money .
2	there is no phone number for this company so consider the pitfalls when something does go_wrong .
2	can '_t praise speckyfoureyes highly_enough .
2	their customer service is excellent - they actually call at the time you ask them to and know what they ' re talking_about !
2	the sunglasses were delivered , as requested , to my son '_s address , in the time requested , and the sunglasses were fine .
2	the prices are geat and i would recommend anyione to use this company .
2	well_done !
2	abloomnova offers all the best products at wonderful prices ... but the most impressive thing about this business is the excellent customer service .
2	buy from abloomnova with absolute confidence !
2	i '_ve just exchanged £_00 woth of clubcard_points for £_00 worth of wrist_bands for fantasy island .

2	thank_you ebay
2	i '_ve been using pointshop to get amazon_vouchers , i havn_'_t spent a penny yet and have received £_00 worth in the past month alone .

2	all in one site .
2	fantastic .
2	the ups delivery man in our area is always polite and delivers .
2	completely dependable and ups would be my first choice .
2	i was so pleased i used superdrug online doctor i had done a home test for an sti which had proved positive so i looked on line to see if there was anything i could get without having to wait weeks for an_appointment at my gp_surgery and came_across superdrug , it was so easy to use and order , my medication arrived in a matter of days and i feel in my self much_better i have bought another home testing kit to see if the sti has cleared but i will wait a few more days but i am very happy no_hassle and all my symptons have gone i will definitely use this online dr service again if needs be
2	i ordered from this company as i liked the look of some of their offers so i chose a bottle of anais anais and a bottle of together forever and although i had used anais anais before i had never tried together forever and a lot of perfumes don , t last very long on me but i put_together forever on at 0 am thismorning went to work as a social carer and nearly 00_hrs_later i can still smell it on me as if i had only just put it on so i am really pleased . delivery of both these purchases was very swift and the packaging was very good . i love the wide_choice available from fragrance_direct and will definitely be using them again they are very good
2	i ordered flowers for my aunts_00th_birthday to be delivered to her house but despite having her address and postcode interflora contacted me to say the florist had been unable to find the house which seems incredible i don , t_believe the florist really tried as the house is on a main rd its not hidden away so i gave interflora a possible place where my aunt may beshe was having lunch out for her_birthday but i wasn , t 000_% sure she was there but the florist went there and just left the flowers without making proper enquieries , interflora sent me an_email to say the flowers had been delivered but then interflora rang me the next_day to say that the place where i thought my aunt was had rung them to say she wasn , t there so the flowers were left there another 0_days before the florist picked them up again and i found my aunts house on google earth and sent interflora directions i was very dissapointed that my aunt hadn , t had the flowers on her special day and i didn , t get an_email to say my aunt got the flowers in the end but my aunt wrote to me i won , t ever use interflora again the service was appalling the flowers were in a basket so they didn , t need making up like a bouquet and i stipulated that the flowers would need to be delivered by 00_noon
2	was looking for all leather converse for my son when i came_across this site .
2	the price was the best i had seen .
2	i was unsure at first until i read the reviews , so i ordered them the response was very quick and they were delivered the very next_day .
2	great quality shoe excellent site .
2	very easy to use .
2	i will_definatly shop_here in the future .
2	thank_you .
2	i was browsing the net trying to find the cheapest , fastest xbox_live as i couldnt wait for it to arrive in the post , when i came_across this website , it said i could have my xbox_live code delivered within 00_minutes of payment , after_reading the good reviews , i decided to buy , i was not dissapointed , my code arrived in 0 minute .
2	and it was so simple to use , also the cheapest to buy at 00 . 00 for 00 months .
2	i will deffinetly be shopping here for future_purchases .
2	tracy .
2	this was the first time i have designed a t shirt .
2	the site was easy to use and tshirt_studio reproduced my design perfectly .
2	the print is excellent quality and the t shirt is brilliant .
2	a cannot_believe i have stumbled on such a gem of a company and will definitely use them again .
2	the service was amazingly quick too !
2	wonderful .
2	sammie was super helpful when i asked a question about which selection to use from one of the drop down_menus and offered to do the whole_process for me .
2	she was extremely friendly even_though ultimately i wasn_'_t able to send my documents via courier .
2	just bought two mares liquid masks ( on sale ), snorkel and fins .
2	i '_m thrilled with all of the products and super happy with the next_day delivery .
2	can '_t wait to get to the turks and caicos islands to try them out .
2	thank_you .
2	the hamper arrived beautifully_boxed but the granite slab was unprotected in the hamper and arrived broken .
2	i found contacting the help_desk very difficult and confusing .
2	the help_desk needs to tell customers when an entry has_been updated .
2	it seems odd to get an_email to confirm that i have just signed for delivery , but issues reported to the help_desk do not create progress emails .
2	the problem has now been resolved to our satisfaction
2	the guy_who made my delivery last_week was very friendly and helpful .
2	we shared a joke about him going to the wrong house .
2	he noticed i was disabled and allowed me to do just my signature by filling in the rest of the screen for me .
2	he offered to bring my package into the house to wherever i needed it and when i said my husband would sort it out he made the offer again to make_sure i was certain .
2	he also checked i was ok before he left .
2	i was very impressed .
2	i created a large square photobook with high_gloss and fold flat options , using the download version of the software .
2	the software is easy to use , it is very flexible and allows you to produce a photobook to your_own design without spending hours " scratching your head " trying to work out exactly_what you want and how to do it .
2	you can look at your product in full size whenever you want and the preview option allows you to see exactly how it will look when printed at anytime .
2	i also use the preview option to look at the book " as a whole " - for example , my latest boom is a 00th_birthday_present so i wanted to make_sure that the pages follow logically and this is easy to do in the preview .
2	once submitted , the book was printed quicky and delivered safely .
2	the hardback photobooks feel and look very profesional .
2	they really add to your images and make them feel extra special .
2	this is the fourth photobook i '_ve made and each time i have been really really pleased with them .
2	i have been using parcel0go for a very long time with no_problems .
2	this week however things did go_wrong , but not because of them .
2	the courier requested a specific parcel which he was given , but then delivered it to the wrong place .
2	parcel0go have sorted this out for me and hopefully my customer will have the correct parcel later today .
2	thank_you tanya on ' live_chat ' for sorting this .
2	it is a very busy time for all couriers , and mistakes_happen .
2	a really disappointing lack of feedback as to what i have just purchased using my valuable credit_card .
2	waited for ages for an_email_confirmation : have i actually hired a car at all ?
2	when it arrived it was so vague as to be downright annoying .
2	apparently this is not a voucher and my voucher will arrive in the next 00_hours otherwise i can email somewhere .
2	this , my friends , is not how to do_business on the net .
2	comparing you to the average us hire company leaves you in the bad place .
2	my mommy ordered the seraquin_tablets for dogs ( large ) for me .
2	she said they were an excellent price and i like the taste of them .
2	its still early days - we are not sure what results to expect but they were affordable which means staying on the treatment will be easy .
2	thank_you for the excellent service and delivery too .
2	mommy also likes the reminder option to have meds sent so i dont run_out .
2	thanks .
2	on behalf of maggie the greyhound
2	delighted with the knowledge available on your products and your excellent service and great prices
2	i used my parcel delivery for the first time this week .
2	i found the website easy to navigate .
2	they are great , they let you know once your parcel is delivered .
2	so easy to do .
2	i just paid , printed out the address_label and took it to the nearest_drop_off point .
2	sailing with my ferry_link is a pleasure .
2	the staff are really friendly and polite and make the crossing so much_easier .
2	the food is very enjoyable and tasty .
2	i found the whole trip very relaxing .
2	i certainly would recommend sailing with this ferry line .
2	i couldn_'_t_believe the service i received .
2	i wanted a cup urgently in memory of someone_who died and had been involved in the forthcoming event .
2	i couldn_'_t buy locally so went on - line .
2	good price and free engraving !
2	asked if possible it could arrive before the following sunday but didn_'_t think it would .
2	text to say delivery between wednesday and wednesday - another text next_day to say ready to be despatched - then that it had been despatched and would arrive that wednesday !!!
2	three_days after order .
2	then another to say that gary would deliver between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 .
2	and gary did arrive with a smile and a perfect presentation cup accurately inscribed .
2	i have been telling_everyone about trophy_store .
2	brilliant product , great price and wonderful delivery service .
2	very good delivered on time and installed then when we had a problem a couple of weeks_later i phoned them saturday_morning and they were out sunday morning fixed problem brilliant service
2	we use interparcel all the time , ups are brilliant , most of the time after booking they are at the front_door before i have had time to print label !!
2	!
2	catherine was brilliant , i was sending a pallet to ireland , my address was longwinded and she tidied it all up for me so the labels could be printed .
2	she did not go offline until i was all sorted .
2	she was excellent and i received an excellent service for the pallet to be picked_up the next_day .
2	it was also 00 . 00 in the evening and she did not leave the chat until 00 . 00 , excellent , she also sorted the courier ups for me .
2	ups picked_up the next_day { today ) at 00 am , what more can you ask for .
2	ups are also an excellent company , service with a smile .
2	this was my first order from woolovers and i was really pleased with the quality of the jumpers that i ordered .
2	i also received a prompt and helpful response to an_email that i sent following one item going out of stock following my order .
2	the response fully_explained what had happened and my order was upgraded to first_class delivery without_any cost to me and the order actually arrived well before their " expected " arrival date .
2	i had personnel service and was made to feel an important and very special customer .
2	goods delivered in excellent condition and on time as requested .
2	i would not_hesitate to use the company again .
2	great items and as always great service , thanks
2	first time that i have used lenstore and i was not disappointed .
2	value for money with very quick postage .
2	prices compare favorably against other_companies and i shall definitely be using again .
2	would recommend to everyone who_wears_contact_lenses .... give them a try
2	the sales_team are most helpful and knowledgeable .
2	delivery time is second to none .
2	easy ordering .
2	item arrived promptly and well_wrapped .
2	would certainly recommend this company and will definitely use again .
2	i would make any future_purchases for your dog from this company they are very good
2	i bought five pair of shoes for what it would normally cost me for one and they are all excellent will be using this site quite_often
2	had a delivery just before christmas 0 items missing , got a refund and a voucher for a free delivery in the future .
2	would have been nicer to have my delivery cost refunded as i had to go out to get missing items , havng a delivery is to avoid going out so delivery was a waste of time
2	can get so many bargains can earn a little by selling and also find different things
2	as i like to have lots of clothes i can_afford to do this by shopping at primark , just a shame norwich is always so messy , but now kings lynn have a branch and thats lovely .
2	went_onto website found what i was looking for paid through paypay so i did not have to key in loads of card_details , and items delivered quickly with email_updates
2	just eat is so handy , all my local takeaways in one place , let '_s me choose easily , and ordering is so simple too .
2	then i can use my card to pay , or pay on delivery ... and it '_s brought to my door ... simplzz :)
2	easyjet ... cheap flights ... you get what you pay for ... small seats , & fast turn_around ... if money is tight then you can '_t beat them , if you want comfort then this isn_'_t the airline for you ... they do " what it says on the tin ", nothing more ... having said that crew were bright & chirpy , & helpful .
2	bugbear : i wish all families with babies were put in the same area of the plane , so those of us without children don_'_t have to endure ( bit_harsh ' endure ' but can '_t think of another word ) ' surround sound ' baby crying ...
2	acceptable experience , but not desired quality ....
2	this was my first experience of using this service , & it did serve me well .
2	as a nervous newbie , i felt concern on the day it was due to be collected , for ' next_day delivery ' when the day was closing fast , and the parcel had still not been collected half an_hour before the ' end ' time .... but then , in the nic ' of time the courier arrived , and all was well :-)
2	this collection worry for me ,( having faithfully promised the addressee , that the parcel would be with her , the following_day )...
2	i think ... could have been removed .
2	a courtesy_call or text in the morning , on the day of delivery , from the courier / driver , letting_me know , that he was aware of my parcel , & it was on his days worksheet - would have let_me know he was coming .
2	any further information , perhaps that he hoped to be with me , either am or pm , or between , 0 & 0 pm , or something_similar , would be a welcome added_bonus .
2	having said that ... &, as i previously said the outcome was positive , everything went to plan , and my parcels addressee was delighted .
2	i will use this service again , even_though you may find it a little dearer_than the post_office - for myself & other people unable to get to the post_office themselves , this service is a godsend .
2	it also saves having to ask friends to carry_heavy items to the post_office , for me .
2	i now believe , that the service is far_superior , & more reliable than the p . office , & can only wish this service success , & many more customers in the future .
2	delighted .
2	good prices & service but when calling customer service i get different answers each time i speak to a different operator .
2	simply beautiful artwork and photography .
2	i will definitely be buying another piece to spruce up my bedroom .
2	the canvas artwork i bought was even more pretty in the flesh although the picture on the site was a good likeness of the actual canvas too .
2	it is better quality than i expected as it was a nice heavy_duty frame unlike the canvases they sell in dunelm or next .
2	its also nice to know the work was produced by a known artist , which is dan forder & the pack includes details about him which is a nice_touch .
2	i was also impressed as i only purchased my canvas on the website at 0 . 00 monday aftrnoon and it arrived just after 0 . 00 tuesday_morning !
2	lastly it looks amazing in my lounge and creates a centerpiece for the room .
2	great for keeping in touch and finding old friends but the changes without my choice are annoying , why cant the new styles just be a choice ?
2	plus each time i have to reset my privacy settings , they should just stay the same .
2	simply beautiful artwork and photography .
2	i will definitely be buying another piece to spruce up my bedroom .
2	its good to know when a site accepts_paypal as i know my payments are completely protected and its also quick and easy to use .
2	a great place to shop because not only do you get great deals on products you can also find things that arent available anywhere_else .
2	i also like the fact that you are fully protected when you pay with paypal .

2	excellent quick service .
2	i received my order very quickly after purchasing it .

2	fantastic vfm - keep_up the good work .
2	i ordered a samsung_fridge_freezer from beyond_television , and it is great .
2	however it was the service which impressed me - i had googled the appliance with a view to getting it as cheaply as possible and beyond tv came up with not only the lowest_price but a code to get a further £_00 off .
2	ok so cheapest doesn_'_t mean best service but i was so impressed by them - i recieved an_email from them confirming everything , then a phone_call to let_me know my preferred delivery date was confirmed , and was told the driver would contact me to advise a delivery time .
2	he phoned the night before as i was going to be his first stop and duly_arrived bang_on time .
2	he was cheerful , smiley and very conscientous , unwrapping the appliance ( i hadn_'_t paid for the service ), positioning it and advising me as to how to let the fridge settle etc before i turned it on .
2	my next appliance will certainly be from beyond_television - must see what else they sell ;-)
2	easy to use website , arrived on time and are now charged up working !
2	excellent company - i was really pleased with the speed at which my order was delivered & the prices are amazing .
2	thank_you all - i will be back !

2	rec '_d link on facebook for free dress , just pay p_&_p .
2	as i was getting free dress , as it was added it to my order , i decided to buy other clothes .
2	imagine my disappointment when i got email to say my order was dispatched but not the free dress !!!!
2	after i enquired i got rather a cheeky email_saying it was a mistake on the website and that i should have known it was not free !!!!
2	was quite happy with other items i bought , but will not , and have informed my friends not to buy from the site either !!!!
2	!
2	i would highly_recommend this company , i have been buying from them years and had a trouble free service .
2	my postcards are very good quality and will help increase business footfall .
2	you need to try it
2	on time , very polite and moved without_any fuss , would recommend to anyone .
2	thank_you x
2	i purchased this item to support a painful & unstable ankle and although it hasn_'_t been a miracle cure it does give support to the ankle & subsequently has also had an effect on the amount of pain .
2	not too unsightly but as i usually wear trousers that isn_'_t really an issue .
2	however i can '_t wear it with all my shoes as it does make them a tighter fit but i mainly wear it for work & those shoes are okay with it .
2	delivery was very quick as it has_been with the previous items i purchased from physioroom . com & i would recommend them to anyone .
2	online site easy to use & liked the few sample choices . the items arrived very quickly & i am delighted with the mascara which does all it promised , not sure_whether the primer is as good but will persevere !
2	this company is very reliable and give a great discount .

2	and they are very reasonable .
2	very competitive_prices .
2	rapid delivery would use this company again
2	i am so disgusted with this company !
2	i have tried to post a review for an item three_times on the website but very do not post it !
2	seems they only want people to see good comments , not truthful ones !
2	we purchased a double glass display_unit a while ago and thought we would get the matching single unit to stand next to it but it does not match at all !
2	the colour is at_least three shades darker_than the double one and although the description states it is the same size the single unit is almost 0 inches taller so the shelves do not align with the double , it has different feet and the wood is rounded , where as the double unit is straight edged .
2	the description on very is really misleading and needs dealing_with !
2	unfortunately as we assembled the unit we were unable to return it so have had to put it somewhere different to where we wanted to , it is a great unit just not matching as stated , so a complete_waste of £_000 .
2	i contacted very and was told they were sorry the item was not as expected and offered me 00_%_off but i would have to keep it !
2	i said no as i think that is an insult , i '_ll still be paying £_00 for an item that was sent in error !
2	they really dont care and say that the most they can offer will be 00_%_off and really dont care that they are charging me for an item they mis_- sold !
2	i have been forced to pay for their mistake !
2	even after quoting the distance_selling regulations to them , they still refuse to do anything_else !
2	i have never been so disappointed by a companies customer service like this before .
2	as long as they have your money , they dont give a toss about customer_satisfaction !
2	no_complaints at all .
2	easy to use website , checkout and fast delivery .
2	will be back for more very soon .
2	my order was a little random , i have a nephew who is 0 years old who is obsessed by my crutches and i have to keep changing the height on mine so he can race around on them pretending he has broken his leg !!!
2	so i needed to find a pair that were suitable for his age to stop him stealing mine on every visit !
2	the ones i found here are absolutely perfect , and the price didn_'_t break the bank .
2	i had to purchase the 0 - 00 year ones as i couldn_'_t see any smaller ones ( even_though they are advertised on the listing !)
2	but as lil man is quite_tall , the ones i got him are brilliant .
2	the only_disappointment was that they weren_'_t red as he wants to be iron man !
2	but apart_from that , complete_care shop have made one very excitable 0 year_old , a very very happy lil man .
2	delivery was superfast too so i am very happy .
2	this is a fantastic shop , the website is so easy to use , i love that my basket is in full_view at all times so i can keep an eye on what i am spending .
2	the quality of all their products is top_notch , the ranges are great , with lots of choice , i can get almost everything i need .
2	its more or less a one stop_shop for me as a jewellery_maker , there are only a few bits that they do not sell that i need to go elsewhere and buy but i '_m hoping they will have them in sometime soon , then i wouldn_'_t need to shop anywhere_else .
2	the clearance_section is fantastic , with some brilliant bargains and the tutorial section is amazing . filled with tips and ideas that i can utilise with my own ideas .
2	their promotional emails filled with bargains and discount_codes etc is always a welcome sight in my inbox .
2	this is one very satisfied_customer who will be back again and again .
2	arrived on time was kept_informed of the progress of my car brought back to the door when they said and all for £_00 fantastic will certainly use them again
2	just looking on the web trying to find a good price on dog_food when i found this site .
2	i found them cheaper_than many sites including amazon , plus they had a good choice
2	in other lines that explained in detail what the products did and the dosage i needed to give .
2	i was having trouble with mites in the hen house tried powder for them but mites came back every four_weeks , and from pet_stores not one of them sold large_amounts and they were expensive .
2	so i went on line and looking at some sites i found wells_poultry their site was very helpful lots of products all sizes good prices , and every time ive bought something delivery has always surprised me how quick its got to me .
2	so my poor hens didnt have to suffer for long .
2	now they are clucking away happily again .
2	i must_say that i rang a number of shops asking if they could supply a pro ject genie 0 turntable with a orofton m0 red upgrade .
2	all the other shops wanted to make a charge to change the cartridge over .
2	hifix changed the cartridge for free , and i also got a great service too .
2	nextday delivery .
2	highly_recomended

2	we set_up a delivery to send a parcel overseas to be collected the next_day , but our friend who the parcel was going to contacted us and asked us to cancel as it would be held by customs for one month due to import regulations .
2	i contacted parcel to go via the chat to us on the web_page and [_name_] was very helpful in cancelling the pick_up and refunding the money back into our account .
2	i will definitely use parcel to go again and will recommend others to use it too .

2	they did arrive exactly when they said they would , excellent service , could not be better

2	easy to use website , good communication via_email and fast delivery , would recommend to a friend .

2	item was delivered two_days after being ordered with normal delivery cost .
2	excellent email communication notifying of each_stage of order process from when order taken to delivery .
2	top company would definately recommend .
2	:-)
2	easy from_start to finish .
2	very quick delivery .
2	i did not see the flowers but had a great response about them .
2	i was told by the company i was returning an item to that it would be collected on either thursday , friday or monday but not to worry at i would get a txt from yodel telling_me which day and the company arranging the return asked for an_alternative location for the trousers to be left should i have to get out .
2	i received no txt so decided when i was going out on the thursday to leave the wrapped item in the designated woodshed .
2	by tuesday no sign of yodel , so called the clothes company to be told a collection had been attempted and that a card had been left .
2	nope , nothing my end .
2	another collection was arranged and the woodshed was still the alternative collection_point .
2	the next_day i did come home to a card simply saying they had shouted everywhere , obviously some clever take on their name .
2	what they hadn_'_t done was on any occasion texted to say which day they were collecting or paid any attention to the note for my collection that they could access the woodshed to find the trousers .
2	the third and final time they came i was luckily in a led the beleaguered driver to the obvious wood shed to retrieve the trousers - he claimed he had no information about an_alternative collection_point or that the company was meant to txt the delivery day .
2	i can_imagine why the clothing company would tell me of such arrangements and ask for a secure_place i would leave the clothing for collection in my absence .
2	yodel have obviously made a good sales_pitch to secure the contract but can '_t fulfil any of it .
2	i needed a dress_shirt at short_notice and was delighted to find one for a very good price at my tuxedo .
2	i opted for the next_day delivery , which again was reasonably_priced for the service and was very relieved when it arrived as scheduled .
2	it was a huge help to have notification by email of the one hour_window the delivery was expected to be made - sometime between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 , it arrived exactly at 00 . 00 !
2	good product , great service and excellent communication .
2	after ordering a bedroom_furniture set in aug and was pleased with decided to order another one for different room in oct arrived 0th_nov some of which was damaged , told rang customer_services told to refuse delivery of those items and replacements would be sent out y end of week which we did . of course replacements were not coming anytime_soon , after numerous_calls to the call_centre and apart_from been told different things about a resolution to our problem which we had to restart the story each time we rang , it was all so robotic word for word even down the very insincere apology for the problem . anyway after all the calls and a letter that was advised by trading_standards giving a deadline saying what we wanted to happen by ( which they responded to the day before that date with no resolution ) help from credit_card provider and 0months later after a lot of stress we decided to demand a refund which also took days to sort_out properly despite reassurances it would happen . i would never recommend a large purchase from asda direct that comes from a supplier . they clearly don_'_t care about their customers and definitely need to look very hard at their customer_services which is out of uk with no empathy or real knowledge of what they are doing there '_s no way contacting anyone in a higher position , you just can '_t past their 0000 number i know i tried . the whole_process is an_absolute_joke .
2	great choice of styles , exceptional prices often receive offers of good deals . customer service very responsive and helpful , quick and easy to order . receive very quickly what '_s there not to like ?
2	had used parcelforce for many_years , but it '_s become expensive and the website is unreliable - along comes hermes where i can book parcels with ease and pop along to my one stop_shop to drop them off , no waiting , no hangups .
2	my customers like the early deliveries as well .
2	super service .
2	thank_you .

2	you put interflora to shame .
2	i initially tried to book some flowers with them , added the flowers to my basket .
2	nothing happened , i rang them up to my disbelief they said they were not available , i said why are they on your website .
2	hence i switched and will stay switched well_done serenata .
2	we used e_- bookers before and we found them helpful and efficient .
2	their website is easy to use too .
2	i would definitely recommend e_- bookers .
2	have just taken delivery of gator extreme guitar_case this morning after_placing order yesterday !
2	( time taken less_than 00_hours !)
2	this is a christmas_present for my grandson , and had already been let_down by another company , who took my order , debited my credit_card , then informed me they were out of stock , and couldn_'_t promise delivery before christmas !
2	due to this experience , i checked by phone that what was showing on website ( in stock ) was correct .
2	the guy i spoke to was great , polite and helpful , unlike the other company !
2	i couldn_'_t_believe it when he said i could get it the next_day !
2	but it '_s arrived , in perfect_condition , and i '_m really happy !
2	now all i have to do is wrap it !
2	fantastic !
2	well_done gak !
2	will certainly use you again !
2	i '_ve booked several_times with alpharooms and my only_complaint is with the the shuttlebus service .
2	just come_back from benidorm booking with alpharooms .
2	landed at 00 . 00 , got cases , 00 . 00 booked in with alpharooms for transfer and arrived at our hotel 0 . 00am , now i think this is unacceptable for what should be a 00_min journey .
2	the same thing happended back in may .
2	went to benidorm again with alpharooms , booked transfers again , it wasn_'_t too bad on arrival , but our home journey , we were on the coach just over an_hour and passed one street away from our original pick - up point !
2	we were picked_up at 0 . 00am and arrived at the airport just before 0 . 00am !
2	now i appreciate you have pick - up '_s to make and someone has to be 0st and someone has to be last , this i can accept , but i think being on a coach or hanging_around for over 0 hours on what is in fact a 00min journey is unacceptable , so sorry , having serious thoughts abouth booking again because of this problem , so look into this alpharooms and i will definitely be booking again .
2	we recently used pine_solutions and i would thoroughly_recommend them .
2	our cottage is quite remote and every delivery has_been quite fraught .
2	however , pine_solutions came up_trumps .
2	we were kept_informed_throughout , the delivery was on time and the delivery men were extremely polite and helpful .
2	rawlins paints have been extremely_helpful , i have bought paint from them on more than one occasion , and found the staff to be very helpful , and give clear and precise information , the technical_team are extremely knowledgable , the deliveries are always on time , and the paint is reasonably_priced .
2	i will certainly be buying again from them again .
2	fast delivery by royal_mail and none of the all - to - frequent rubbish about not delivering to shetland or charging extra for a carrier who has no proper delivery arrangements within shetland .
2	thank_you for treating us as the uk citizens we are .
2	yeah !
2	pretty easy to find short_stay car_park on outward_journey and inbound journey .

2	i was so amazed_at the speed my converse high tops arrived as they were for my daughter and they made her day !!!
2	we searched every high_street town around us for the colour she wanted in the size she took and no luck .
2	i just happened to find rubbersole !
2	thank god !!!
2	saved my life from the constant moaning especially as my daughter can wear them to school as they are black ha_ha_ha
2	this company is so easy to use , efficient , and most of all alot more economical than royal_mail ..... quite a lot_cheaper_than the untracked quote from post_office ... we got parcel collected on a day convenient for us , email with tracking_number , delivered to netherlands within 0_days ... door to door service , without leaving front room ..... will definitely use again .... a must for ebayer '_s with lots of parcels to go ....... brilliant service ..... thanks
2	i bought these tickets as a christmas gift for my husband .
2	the tickets were described as vip and music / celebrity / priority guests - that is exactly_what they were !
2	!
2	great seats , great view - we wouldn_'_t have wanted to be anywhere_else - except maybe a little further down the tier - we were in row m - still really good seats in our block 000 .
2	we did spot several ' celebrity faces ' in our block .
2	fantastic - well_worth the price !
2	!
2	my husband states now ' no other seats will do ' - so unless i can get vip seats normally , which i don_'_t think is possible - double0 is the place to go again !
2	:-)))
2	good value , originals , excellent service , will use this site in the future as where else can you buy named perfumes as cheap as this , i looked and i found cheap_smells .
2	i have ordered needles , wool , and patterns from deramores on a few occasions , i can not recommend them highly_enough for the service which they offer .
2	the staff are polite , friendly , and very efficient and nothing is to much_trouble for them , they make you feel special .
2	my latest order was placed on the 00th_feb and i received it on the morning of the 00th_feb hows_that for service ?
2	i now order all of my knitting requirements from deramores . thank_you all very much .
2	very pleased with the work_tops .
2	they look stunning in our kitchen .
2	our new goose feather and down mattress_topper is absolutely wonderful .
2	it is actually heavier_than i had imagined , but once on the bed that really doesn_'_t matter .
2	excellent value for money .
2	i have also been really impressed by the customer service offered by dapw .
2	quick and easy delivery ( not always the case for the isle of wight )!
2	i would definitely use this company again and have no_hesitation in recommending them .
2	i love shopping with stone_bridge hair_accessories - there '_s something for everyone , including me with my unruly , " mind of their own " curls .
2	they ' re great with advice too , and it feels_like a really personal service , a bit like having your_own style consultant .
2	all the items i '_ve bought are top quality and excellent value .
2	lovestretch offers an unusual range of clothing with a hint of luxe that '_s great for yoga , chilling , partying and more .
2	all my dealings with them have been first_class - delivery is prompt and refunds are a simple , fuss free transaction .
2	i '_d happily_recommend them to anyone interested in looking good while they work , rest and play !
2	i paid for a ' queue jump ' service but the company had my ipad for over 0_weeks and kept using the excuse that they were waiting for supplies of screens to arrive !
2	each week they advised a shipment was due but then apologised because it didn_'_t arrive !
2	i arranged to collect my ipad but was told that i would still lose £ 0 . 00 for delivery because that '_s what it says on their website !!!!
2	still_waiting for a refund - i would definitely check reviews of a company before i use them in the future - this company is using false_advertising my saying they can repair your item within 0_days !!!!!!
2	do not use them if you want your device repairing quickly - or not repairing as was my case !!!
2	i am a genuine customer of repairs0 - and have documented emails to prove their inability to repair my ipad .
2	it has taken me 00 years to persuade my husband to get on a plane , having had a bad_experience on a flight some 00 years_ago .
2	last saturday ( 00th_october ) we took a flight from manchester to barcelona and i had a quiet word with the flight staff when we boarded the plane to advise them of my husband '_s acute anxiety .
2	i can only describe the attitude of the jet0 staff on board that day as being exceptional .
2	sarah and linda ( cabin_crew ) were extremely attentive and did everything they could to make the journey as stress - free and relaxing as possible for my husband .
2	after the plane_landed in barcelona and the other passengers had disembarked , they very kindly_offered to take my husband into the cockpit area to meet the captain , who took the time to answer some of my husbands many questions .
2	i cannot thank jet0 enough for making the flight such a pleasant_experience for both of us , and i am overwhelmed to report that my husband says he will fly again .
2	we can now look_forward to sharing future overseas holidays together , and i cannot put into words what this means to me ..... who needs marriage guidance when you have jet0 .
2	thank_you from the bottom of my heart .
2	debbie faulkner
2	had deliveries from company many_times , always great service and friendly reliable driver .

2	one very happy customer :) thank_you
2	outrageous price £_000 just to change a name on a ticket , would be better for them to charge a sensible price as on that principle i will not cancel my flight to allow them to get another lot of money for flight
2	i am a fairly new customer to isme , although i have placed quite a few orders , i am very pleased to say the items are delivered the very next_day .
2	well_packed and a coat i ordered was in a big box rather_than just a hanger !
2	clothing is of very high_standard and a huge_variety of choice and designs for all sizes .
2	the only_thing i can complain_about is the they give you the option of free delivery when you choose collect_+, which i have always done , however i am ' always charged delivery the fee which is not good and not too happy about !!
2	!.
2	delivery , upgrades , the complete service was excellent
2	i have dealt_with catherine funnily_enough twice this week and both time i could not have been happier in fact where i always hated arranging a collection now i really dont mind with the live_chat .

2	it has_been a pleasure to do_business with parcels to go .
2	thank_you
2	i discovered the company by_accident last_year and had wonderful service from them , especially sarah .
2	i had no_hesitation in booking through them again this year as it was another long_haul holiday and their prices were excellent - really good savings !
2	once again sarah stuart did everything for us and answered any_queries we had about our travel_plans .
2	of course we would come_back to them for another holiday , no question !

2	after_speaking to a very helpful lady assistant on a saturday , our z - tec rollator
2	arrived first thing on the tuesday_morning .
2	my husband who has had three major
2	heart operations has found it to be the most suitable rollator and has not stopped
2	using it since it arrived .
2	on many occasions we had tried to speak to someone
2	responsible in several other mobility companies , and had sent back several other
2	rollators which were much heavier_than advertised .
2	the z - tec is by far the lightest
2	one we have found , it is well balanced and easy to put in the car .
2	it has_been used
2	round supermarkets , three racing stables with cobbled yards , and he really would
2	not have coped without it .
2	the most necessary item has_been the seat as he frequently has to sit_down quickly , and is able to do this on his own .
2	we found that simple mobility provided the best friendly and professional advice out of all the numerous companies we were in contact with .
2	a health professional
2	posted my " a " class condition ipad yesterday morning .
2	had an_email from ipad_recycle before 00 : 00 this morning agreeing with the condition and payment was in my account by lunchtime .
2	would highly_recommend this company , both for value and also first_class speedy service .
2	very simple ordering process , flowers arrived as arranged and were in excellent condition .
2	ordered at 0pm and goods were delivered next_day free of charge .
2	excellent !
2	led i was looking for was out of stock but received a call offering an_alternative that day or to check it was ok to wait 0 or 0_days for my first choice .
2	took the alternative and received it the next_day - great service .
2	fantastic prices , easy to use ordering and brilliant local fitting .
2	always use blackcircles and don_'_t intend to change .

2	i was looking around for a particular item , stumbled_upon etwist and shortly_after i arrived at their website i was greeted_by a friendly online_chat person .
2	i can '_t say enough how good this person was in helping_me not only to find the right product , but when i found something that suited me even better , they changed my order and refunded the difference .
2	while i was browsing around their site i found the odd typo which i mentioned to my chat friend - and the errors were corrected immediately !
2	plus when i commented that a description was incorrect , presto it was changed almost on the spot .
2	i was so impressed , i was glad i had found them .
2	then my product arrived .
2	packaged carefully , quickly delivered , and exactly as i had hoped - the one i had wanted after the first purchase was supplanted by a product that suited me even better .
2	i was worried that it would not be the right one delivered , but it was .
2	and it is a great product .
2	i really think this company has got it on the ball !
2	i have only had one experience with them , but i will always look at their site first now before searching elsewhere .
2	good on you etwist !
2	keep_up the good work !
2	these_folks are great - they have all the batteries in all the kinds you could want , they send them out pronto , and keep track of your discount for you .
2	oh , and they send a treat in every package .
2	can '_t be beat .
2	excellent customer service .
2	i have ordered photo_books from several sources but the one i made at photoworld was the best for flexibility of design .
2	i appreciated being_able to adjust numbers of photos , add and subtract , change sizes , and add text .
2	i re - ordered the same book several_times for friends - each was made carefully and sent quickly .
2	i highly_recommend photoworld .
2	there is a much_better selection than in the shops , and very quick delivery - thank_you .
2	the price for a bird - feeder base was much_cheaper_than_anywhere_else and arrived three_days_later on the day specified .

2	i '_d bought a climbing harness from someone_else , it took_ages to come , and when i tried to change it they didn_'_t tell me the size i wanted was not in stock so i waited but nothing happened .
2	000_% different experience with outdoorkit .
2	they sent the competitively_priced harness , without charging the earth for delivery , it arrived on time and they were even able to add another small item to my order after the first one was processed without charging more for delivery .
2	great service !
2	i shall be recommending outdoorkit to my friends .
2	i ordered a mug which i personalised to reflect a pop star as i was unable to find a mug for devlin for my daughter '_s christmas_stocking .
2	i used a 0 screen_shots from a web image and a combined them on the mug .
2	i was really pleased with the quality of the mug and the speed in which it was delivered .
2	thanks so much - she will be thrilled !
2	buying flowers was really easy , i was told when they left the depot , and exactly when they were delivered , well_worth the money to ensure they arrived on time .
2	excellent , my friend loved them !
2	i ordered two_pairs of shoes , both were excellent and didnt look £ 0 . 00 at all .
2	very modern and expensive looking .
2	the postage is quite high but if you order more than 0 item , its a bargain !
2	many many_thanks .
2	i first ordered one of these blinds for one window only , just to see if they were any good , and whther i would like them !
2	it arrived after a week and we fitted it , which took about 00_minutes , after we figured_out what we were doing !
2	then the trouble was i loved them so much , that i had to take it down while i ordered the rest of the blinds to do the front of my house !!
2	these also arrived after a week , ordered on a monday , delivered the following_monday , all securely_packaged to protect them .
2	will be back , for the back of the house , real soon , such a bargain price , and no drilling !
2	!
2	well_done to all your team .
2	a very good selection of items and it is reassuring that you don_'_t lose half your refund in return postage if anything you order is not quite suitable for you
2	i had my first pc from pc_specialist almost 0 years_ago and the second 0 , i have never had any_problems with either .
2	each current one was on all day every day pc_specialist '_s website must be unique in having the option to configure your_own pc and save or change the components of each quote for now or maybe the near_future .
2	the service was always faultless , informed of progress_throughout by email and available info in online account also .
2	any query was quickly answered
2	it '_s obvious who i '_ve just bought computer no . 0 from !
2	the same excellent service which includes robust packing and timed delivery by dpd one of the best .
2	i forgot to mention prices , i '_m quite experienced at price comparison , need i say more !
2	unfortunately the first one will have to go , i don_'_t need 0 .
2	i was very pleased to find all that i needed that day at a competitive price especially when i received it the next_day .
2	hopefully they will soon expand their dog range and i will buy even more .
2	everything about my order , including pre order query was first_class .
2	i received items 00_hours after_placing order !
2	i think their prices may be lower too .
2	i had a very mixed experience with serenata_flowers !
2	my first_impression was honestly i would not touch them again with a barge_pole !
2	their lack of any phone customer service is hugely frustrating , especially as i had moved and the website would not allow me to change any details , although i tried five times !!
2	so my delivery was not delivered on the day i wanted and then i was told there was a mistake and it had gone to the wrong delivery depot .
2	i sent three emails and none were replied to .
2	however , when they eventually did wake_up to the fact that i was getting desperate , they were efficient and the flowers arrived when they said they would !
2	well_done for redeeming yourself serenata .
2	we have been with viziononline for approx 0 years_now .
2	we were in desperate_need of web_page and having no knowledge of web & design myself i was very fortunate to come_across viziononline , and wow what a fabulous site they designed for us .
2	thank_you .
2	henry and his team are very enthusiastic and genuinely_care that you are happy with their product .
2	absolute first_class service in every_aspect , would recommend them each & every day .
2	this is the third time i '_ve_used this company and i will_continue to do so any time i want to send flowers .
2	prices are very reasonable , service is excellent , and on each_occassion , the recipients of the boquets have phoned me immediately to say how beautiful the flowers were .
2	serenata_flowers is the hassle_free way to send beautiful boquets .
2	items exactly as_described on their website - arrived quickly and well_packaged .
2	would use again .
2	i ordered a canon_000d camera_body from simplyelectronics on the tuesday_evening .
2	only later in the evening did i see all the other reviews commenting on the poor service and liability for import_duty and vat etc .
2	on the wednesday_morning i was intending to contact customer_services and cancel the order , when i received an e_- mail to say that my item had already been dispatched ( it was on a 0 - 0 day delivery ).
2	i was even more surprised to see the courier at my door later that afternoon .
2	the turnaround was certainly impressive !
2	!
2	the camera packaging was sealed and in good condition .
2	the canon instruction_manual referred to a uk address and contact numbers and the packaging contained a uk 0 - pin_plug .
2	i have registered the camera serial_number with canon and the camera works_perfectly with my existing lenses ( both generic and canon ).
2	there is absolutely nothing to give me concern regarding a grey import and at less_than 00_hours between placing the order on - line and receiving the goods the camera must have come from a uk address ( the senders address on the delivery label was in london ).
2	based on this i would happily use this website again .
2	good vitamins at a sensible price , plus my delivery arrived in 0_days .
2	thanks so much !
2	we ordered a towel_rail which arrived missing a grub screw so my husband was unable to put it up .
2	rung best bathrooms about it and they were very helpful .
2	was expecting another grub screw to be sent , but another towel_rail arrived , this one having all the needed screws !
2	when i rung to thank them and ask what i was to do with the first towel_rail , i was told to keep it , very honest company to deal with , we shall_certainly use them again .
2	i have used vitasunn for over a year now and they are great . i once ordered wrongly , it was put right straight_away for me . they are a great company to deal with , keep_up the good work !
2	thanks .
2	given a delivery date when i i ordered .
2	i was kept up to date with emails and texts and then on the .
2	day of delivery the delivery driver rang to let_me know he was half an_hour away .
2	could not fault it .
2	beware food ordered and paid for did not arrive .
2	could not use live_chat on just eat as too early in the evening .
2	drove to the takeaway which was closed .
2	when i contacted just eat they did appologise and told me that the money requested from my bank_account for the meal would be put back within 00 days and any concerns should be taken up with the take away .
2	likewise the take away told me to take the matter up with just eat .
2	unbelievable i will not use again .
2	i had a long_winded enquiry about saturday deliver and the advisor sarah_hayes was very quick to give me the information requested , very polite also .
2	next_day delivery i always feel is excellent but dpd go even better and give you a 0 hour time_slot !
2	how they manage to do it i don_'_t know !
2	with traffic and poor roads and people not in when they call etc it '_s amazing !
2	the driver was well in the 0 hour_slot and was friendly and professional .
2	i wish every supplier would use dpd - they are ' simply the best '.
2	:-)
2	thanks
2	great experience buying a present of prada glasses from fashion_eyewear recently .
2	easy to use website for ordering .
2	kept up to date with progress of order .
2	excellent carrier who gave_us a one hour_slot for the delivery and delivered within that hour !
2	the glasses were very well_packed .
2	my son was absolutely_delighted with the glasses .
2	extremely delighted with the whole_experience .
2	i would use fashion_eyewear again and certainly recommend them to my friends .
2	thanks :-)
2	have used cheerful soles before .
2	they carry a good range of alegria shoes and their service is very quick and reliable .
2	parcel was late being picked_up so i rang company .
2	they assured me that i was down for a pick_up and despite the company only picking_up till_0pm , my parcel was picked_up at 0 . 00pm .
2	i thought they had forgotten but i should have given them the chance .
2	their web_page was so easy to use and the quote was instant .

2	well_done webtogs :-)
2	we went for a sight_seeing weekend with our two children .
2	yes it was raining but there was no excuse for health and safety issues , the staff were cramming people onto the bus even_though there were no seats or safe standing areas left , people were allowed to stand on the stairs which left you having to come down on the narrowest of stair area .
2	prams were put against doors so you could only enlight from the front doors next to driver .
2	i have written to the company but feel as if i was just dis regarded and have had no reply back off them on my second correspondence to them .
2	i would never use this company there are other_companies that do exactly the same .
2	they were not packing the customers on and there were more buses for certain other_companies so if you are considering using the bus service do not use big_bus_tours .
2	i was a little_worried_about having to wait for the tickets in the post , however they arrived in plenty of time .

2	when they were delivered , the delivery men were really lovely and it just finished off a great experience with oakfurnitureland .
2	we have self_catering accommodation .
2	on two of the five beds we used your duvets .
2	we have had so many good comments about those duvets that i have just ordered more so that all of the beds now have them .
2	and some of our_guests have asked where we get them from because they would like to buy them for their own beds .
2	you can '_t say better_than that . "
2	if you are looking for shampoo and conditioner look no further this company has great service and good value for money .
2	if you ' re looking for a friendly place to buy good quality hair_accessories which you can '_t find on the high_street give stonebridge a try .
2	now that i have found them i would honestly not buy from anyone_else x
2	i ordered 0 items on april 0 and eventually received second item today ( 0 / 00 ).
2	this situation caused a lot of inconvenience to my disabled_father .
2	the company was very apologetic about the situation and i hope they will improve their customer service .
2	the items seems to be of a good quality .
2	these vitamines are the only effective treatment i have ever found for my drippy , coughing sinus congestion .
2	i have ordered these for my sister who has the same symptoms .
2	i was so glad to find a great price for a great product .
2	if i were you i would go to isme online .
2	they have loads of choice and i love the clothes i purchased and i '_m_sure everyone will love the pressies when they open them at christmas .
2	i once had to contact them with a query which was dealt_with really quickly and the lady i spoke to was very friendly and really helpful .

2	my pans still look brand_new actually everything i have bought does .
2	if you ' re ordering baking_trays make_sure you measure your oven because i ordered some and when i received them they were too_big for the oven my sister in law thought it was great because she got them for nothing !

2	when you have little time to shop for a number of animals , i found everything i needed in pet_supermarket .
2	checkout was quick ..... no waiting to be served and fast delivery .
2	thankyou pet_supermarket .
2	your product certainly seems to work and arrived far quicker_than we anticipated .
2	saw this product whilst on holiday , ordered upon our return , and it was delivered the following_day .
2	very impressed
2	in december_0000 we purchased 0 leather recliners from this company , also purchasing an extended 0 year_warranty , for several months we have been experiencing back pain when using them which is obviously here the stuffing / padding is breaking_down .
2	as we had the warranty we contacted them , only to be told , not covered , read the small_print .
2	i would advise people not to go_anywhere_near them , as there products are no good .
2	we changed to first_utility in november_0000 on the basis that we could submit monthly meter_readings and monitor our usage .
2	since then we have been unable to submit our electricity readings and have had to send them through via the ' contact us ' facility .
2	we have been unable to monitor our usage of electricity as they don_'_t enter our readings onto our on - line account and , as a result , we haven_'_t been able to view any bills .
2	we don_'_t know whether our direct_debit is sufficient to cover the charges and are worried we will receive a huge bill at some point - presuming they ever get to enter our electricity readings onto our account .
2	we have tried_phoning their premium_rate number but are left hanging on for over half an_hour and we eventually give up .
2	the problem seems to be that we have an old ' economy 0 ' meter that gives two readings ( day rate and night rate ) and their website does not appear to be able to handle two readings .
2	our rates are the same for both readings as we no_longer have ' economy 0 '.
2	i have suggested by email that i add both readings together and enter them as a single reading but have had no response from them .
2	they are totally_incompetent and appear to have no experience or skill in the energy industry .
2	i will have to write a letter of complaint to them as it is the only way i can get through to them .
2	if that doesn_'_t work i will go through the energy ombudsman to see if they can resolve the issues .
2	do not go to them unless you are confident your situation is straightforward and they can '_t mess up .
2	the website was easy to use and we found what we wanted immediately at a competitive price .
2	after checking other_sites i returned to looking0parking and it was easy to make our booking .
2	however , if we had waited a couple of days before making our booking we would have received an_email offering us a discount !
2	the parking company was just outside southend_airport but was a little difficult to find due to incorrect directions on the paperwork .
2	the courteous and friendly member of staff apologised and said he would get the directions changed .
2	he arranged a taxi to the airport and , on our return a week_later , a driver was waiting for us in the arrivals area .
2	i would recommend this site to anyone .
2	het produkt ( moeilijk verkrijgbaar in uk ) was gemakkelijk te vinden op_de website en ook_de telefonische service was vlot en behulpzaam .
2	de betaling via creditcard gaf ook geen problemen .
2	ik woon in engeland en verwachtte een langere tijd van levering ... maar tot mijn verbazing was zelfs dat uiterst snel ( fantastisch !!!)
2	keep it up !
2	- thank_you .
2	if you ' re buying online anyway , go through_topcashback and build up a treat fund :)
2	easy to use and zero cost - why wouldn_'_t you ?
2	incredibly easy to book and the cheapest rate around .
2	all went like_clockwork !
2	easy web_site to use .
2	i was kept well informed of the progress of my order and the pre release arrived a day early = much to my husband '_s joy !
2	will definitely use again .
2	received my keys in just a few_days and thy were the right ones !
2	!
2	this is 0th occasion on which i have purchased handbags through boohoo .
2	if you are the kind of gal who_likes a frequent change of hand_luggage , then boohoo is the place to indulge your passion !
2	i ordered gold envelopes and was surprised to see that they arrived in a very nice gold bubble_wrap envelope only to find that the contents were not gold at all .
2	in fact the colour was closer to yellow !
2	can '_t be bothered to return them , but wouldn_'_t order again .
2	i bought a clothing rail , which arrived flat packed .
2	to my surprise the product arrived in break neck time , the very next_day !
2	it was easy to erect and dismantle and was of a high_quality .
2	it was also relatively light , so easy to carry .
2	the only_thing i need now is a holdall to carry it in .
2	i will re visit the site to see if you have one available .
2	thanks !
2	i was very surprised at the amazing value for money the products are .
2	very much_cheaper_than my vet_practice , and free delivery too .
2	will be recommending to friends
2	they are a great on - line company with a simple , well displayed site .
2	my one small_gripe - i hadn_'_t ordered earlier as some items were sold out or out of stock , but my fault !
2	in october_0000 , we found ( we thought then ) the furniture that we had been searching for ; reviews of ofl led us to feel that placing an order of £_000_+ was worth taking a chance .
2	a mistake we will not repeat elsewhere and most certainly never again with ofl .
2	do not buy from this company .
2	the after sales care is non - existent .
2	this is a reusme of what we experienced :
2	order placed 0st_november_0000 ; a delivery time of 0_months was given which we felt was a long time but the furniture was just what we had been looking for so we decided we could be patient a little_longer ; after 0_months , we received an_email from ofl saying they had tried to phone us – a stupid lie when our phone displays missed calls and has an answer phone facility ; i called ofl , who advised me of a delay of about a month – no reason given .
2	a month later , no contact from ofl – i called ofl ; they reported that they had no news on my delivery and would look into it .
2	no phone_call was received .
2	i also sent an_email requesting information ; i never received a reply .
2	i went on to make 00 calls to ofl and was given a variety of excuses about the delay to my furniture , including : ‘ we ’ ve been badly_let_down by our suppliers but we are sourcing another_provider ’; ‘ its been put in the hands of the managers , they will call you ’ ( they never did ); ‘ we ’ ve got the bookcase but not the bureau , we wouldn ’_t deliver a part order ’ ( fair_enough except that in the end , neither item was delivered and i was told the book case had disappeared from the system ); ‘ the order is being shipped from china so it ’_s difficult to give an exact arrival date ’; ‘ the ship ’_s been delayed ’; ’ the warehouse is being relocated so the system isn_’_t showing what stock is available ’; i was even ‘ guaranteed ’ a despatch date at one point by one assistant , a statement which was described as ‘ inexplicable ’ by another assistant as ofl hadn_’_t received the furniture at that point .
2	refunds were offered at various points but at the same time as suggesting the furniture we wanted was within sight which persuaded us to keep waiting ; an_error in hindsight .
2	we were finally told , 0_months from the original order , that the furniture had not been on the ship from china .
2	the assistant made a great show of saying this was not the information he had expected and apologised – then had the audacity to ask if there was anything_else we might be interested in from the company .
2	ofl seemed clueless about the progress of delivery and appeared chaotic in their administration and communication .
2	i am staggered that i received only one phone_call from them yet made 00 .
2	i am staggered that i received no letters or emails from the company of apology or explanation .
2	the casual indifference of the staff made us think this was a frequent occurrence .
2	the refund slip posted to us attached to an unsigned compliments slip says it all .
2	they didn_’_t care .
2	i have been using wormers . co . uk for a number of years_now , cheaper products than the vet and high_st , and free_postage !
2	i '_ve never had any_problems , i order my pet goods and they arrive within a couple of days , prompt and reliable service , well recommended .
2	fantastic service from_start to finish .
2	no pushy_sales people , just really helpful .
2	fantastic communication re delivery and absolutely love my new dining_table , chairs and sideboard .
2	delivery men were great and free delivery is fab .
2	would recommend this company to everyone .
2	a refreshing_change nowadays to get good service .
2	can_rely_on .
2	will deliver on time
2	i discovered this company on line .
2	i telephoned as i needed some information about the goods that i required .
2	i found them to be most helpful .
2	i placed my order and received my goods the following_day .
2	i think everyone should use topcashback .
2	if i forget to use it when buying something i could kick_myself !!
2	!
2	i have used biosthetique products for at_least 00 years and until haircare shop i struggled to get these products , not only that others charged much more for the products , the explanation for each of the products is very clear and you cant go_wrong when chosing , then the haircare shop is simple and easy to pay and very quick service to deliver .
2	i recommend you try them , you maynot want biosthetique products but they also have salon professional products as well and electrical_appliances for very good value .
2	give them a go , they are on my favourites address list and will remain there .
2	thank_you haircare shop !
2	!

2	got exactly_what i asked for ans was very happy x
2	i was a little_apprehensive ordering a silver_bracelet and charms online as i would usually like to see and feel the products ( jewelry ) before i purchase .
2	it took me three_days before i finally pushed the ' buy now ' button but i was so glad i did .
2	it arrived within a couple of days and the quality was exceptional and i even got a free candy_cane !
2	it0 was purchased for my daughters xmas_present and she was thrilled with it .
2	i chose the charms that related to her and , as she has had a damaged ankle for many_years , is very often on crutches so imagine my delight and the families chuckles when i found a charm of a pair of crutches .
2	thank_you so much for your brilliant service .
2	i will definitely be recommending the charmworks .
2	easy to navigate website .
2	great selection .
2	excellent delivery .
2	i have just taken delivery of my kitchen_appliances , oven , cooker_hood and hob .

2	after the appalling service i have recently experienced from a very well_known high_street electrical company , i applaud go appliances on - line and will definitely recommend them in future .
2	thank_you
2	regards

2	i did a lot of research before buying my le00d0000 samsung_tv .
2	i had already ordered this through comet 0_weeks_ago only to find it was out of stock with no supply date
2	i then found beyond_television .
2	i wasn_'_t sure about using an internet company i had not heard of but they had the model i wanted at a good price and feedback was good
2	customer service was first_class , delivery was arranged for a time that suited me and was included in the price and then they rang me the day before to say they were in my area and would i like it delivered within the hour .
2	i would definitely recommend them .
2	when i had my shop re fitted is was a pleasure to deal with metric , as every thing i needed was completed by them to a high_standard . i have had lovely comments from my customers on how lovely the shop looks .
2	the staff were very cheerful and helpful and nothing was to much_trouble for them .
2	would recommend their services to anyone .
2	i posted my mobile at 0pm yesterday and money was in my bank by 0pm today .
2	brilliant service .
2	i ordered a camera bundle after_trawling the net for the best deal .
2	i '_d never_heard of slrhut so i was a little_wary .
2	after_placing my order i received a phone_call from a gentleman called john offering me a free upgrade on the memory_card i '_d ordered with the bundle and a free upgrade on the delivery .
2	he then offered me an up - sell on the power_pack , offering it for £_00 instead of the usual £_00 .
2	at this point alarm_bells were ringing in my ears so i declined the power_pack and after finishing the call went_onto the review site to check out customer reviews .
2	when i saw the great reviews i called the company back and spoke to john .
2	i decided to purchase the upgraded power_pack .
2	two_days after_placing my order it arrived and it is absolutely fantastic .
2	i paid at_least two hundred_pounds less for an amazing bundle than i could find anywhere_else .
2	if you are wondering_whether this is a legitimate company then the answer is a resounding yes .
2	i was very impressed with how quickly my order was delivered .
2	i found vet -_medic to be one of the cheapest pet suppliers on line .
2	delivery was quick also .
2	would definitely recommend
2	i have used travel_republic many_times and have always found them very thorough .
2	if there are any changes , eg flight times , i have received a text_message .
2	i would definitely recommend travel_republic .
2	good price for laurent perrier rose , good communications and quick delivery .
2	we bought tickets for a second time from double 0 .
2	they are trustworthy - we have lost money with other ticket sites !.
2	the seats were great and tickets were delivered speedily and efficiently .
2	would definately recommend them to others and would buy from them again .
2	very quick service , after sending in mobile cheque arrived within two_days .
2	having used mazuma_mobile for the 0nd time , i find there service is second to none .
2	i posted my phone off and less_than 00_hours_later , the money was in my bank .
2	first_class .
2	would definitely recommend to friends .
2	i was introduced from topcash and switched to npower back in november_0000 no cash_back left a ticket for them to reply and they say that npower should send commision over to topcash , npower state they have done this who do i believe just want what they said they would do .
2	all bills have been paid could someone from cashback please chase this up .
2	proof will be in the pudding but booking a great hotel in bergen for a swift hop over there has_been really easy .
2	it '_s late so i couldn_'_t have tolerated a lengthy process ... this was simple and hassle - free .
2	great stuff .
2	my order was made with no_fuss , all very straightforward ... delivery quick ... lights are just what i want ..... well pleased !!
2	!
2	i have used dialtosave for a while now and it is great , i save pounds on my overseas phone_calls , one can use it with their mobile too .
2	although there is no phone number to make contact with them ( this bothered me at first ) their customer_services is second to none , just leave a message on the site and they get to you real quick ,,,, very helpful too and personel , by this i mean , they seem to treat you as if you are a friend and not just a customer .
2	don_`_t think_twice about using dialtosave !!!
2	!
2	i was recommended by a friend to try nets0go and was so glad she passed on their details to me .
2	they offer a wide_choice of nets and voiles with free_samples of designs so that you can see what you are buying .
2	the prices were cheaper_than shop ones i had looked at too .
2	i ordered april voile .
2	the curtains were good quality , beautifully_finished and easy to order ; the website helps you through the measuring process .
2	they label the curtains for each room in separate bags .
2	all you have to do is hang them !
2	also bought the telescopic net_rods which were very reasonably_priced and work brilliantly .
2	all in all a very good company to deal with .
2	nothing more to say , only buy from them and you will not be disappointed .
2	price was good for insinkerator but until i ordered i was given every indiction that delivery would be amost immediate but once you had my order them i was informed that item was a manufactures order and i would have to wait .
2	fortunately for you the plumbing was delayed otherwise i would have gone_elsewhere and cancelled my odrer .
2	since others had this common item in stock i am surprised that an oganisation as big as yours did not .
2	the original date could not be met since it was a bank_holiday but fornately they were able to deliver a day early .
2	absolutely_brilliant you can buy all the things you need and get cashback even when things are already discounted .
2	these appartments were really clean but very basic .
2	and were a good way out of faliraki .
2	the nearest shops were a good 00 to 00 minute_walk and was all uphill on way back .
2	there was no tv but there was free wifi which was good .
2	the owners were very friendly and the cleaner was nice she cleaned the rooms every day and changed bedding and towels .
2	were nice enough appartments but just too far out for us .
2	have used olympic before and their holidays are excellent for value and service
2	excellent service from_start to finish .
2	the website is easy to navigate and the prices are good .
2	the communication is great they email and text to confirm your order when it '_s on the way and finally when it '_s delivered
2	used anyvan to find a courier for my range_cooker was put in touch with barry who was excellent delivered the very heavy cooker and his communication was brilliant phoned me to say he was on his way then when he picked_up the cooker .
2	first_class service
2	using these for my 0 - 0 diet so far so good .
2	only tried the porridge as was waiting for my partners to arrive so we could start together .
2	also got the drinks flavouring which is very nice
2	we go on many cruises and the ships tours are really expensive .
2	up to now we have only gone on city sight_seeing buses when away .
2	i found victor by_chance and cannot_believe the choice of tours and the excellent value .
2	i will definitely use them everywhere we go and recommend them to friends
2	wondeful service by the staff .
2	also excellant quality and service
2	excellant sevice all_round .. i have used viovet for around 00 months now , their service either by phone or internet is second to none .. the viovet team are always helpful .
2	that '_s what it always feels_like anyway because the items often arrive the next_day .
2	i have been using simpygames now for about 0 years and they have never let_me down .
2	their prices are very competitive , often beating the other main online_retailers .
2	the service is swift and efficient .
2	if you need to speak to them they are friendly and hellpful .
2	iceland is great for familys of all ages i have shopped with them for 00yrs .
2	i would recomend to anyone
2	i really enjoy shopping this way .
2	can shop in the comfort in my home and on the internet .
2	i have never had problems even when i made a mistake as to were i wanted delivery i was able to contact them by email i dont like using the phone and i was able to sort problem out , thank_you littlewoods for a great service
2	i don_'_t think i '_ve ever trusted a company as much as i do essential_nails .
2	nothing on the market even comes_close to the quality of their products , level of service and prices .
2	you guys_rock !!
2	!
2	as i am housebound xmas_presents etc are so much_easier for me to buy via_amazon !
2	have bought many items and been happy with all but one ... non sticky fly tapes !!
2	lol
2	we ordered from [_link_] in broadgreen liverpool .. our order contained meals and soups .. the food was not hot and the soup had burst_open all over the bag ,, i rang to complain and was told more soup was to be delivered .. no apology ... and soup did not arrive .. poorly run business .. i would not recommend it to anyone !
2	i love just eat but will choose a different take away outlet next time ...
2	update ... tried a different outlet .. jalalabad in liverpool .. waited nearly 0 hours but delivery man was apologetic and the food was absolutely_gorgeous !
2	we had set meal for 0 with lamb korma .. massive portions .. couldn_'_t eat it all in one go !
2	i would definitely recommend the jalalabad !
2	thank_you justeat as we got 00_%_off via your site :)
2	world first are first_class , extremely friendly and very helpful customer service and above all excellent prices on insurances packages , will never use anyone_else for our tavel insurance_purposes .
2	great price , excellent range of products , the delivery service is very quick and the communication received was excellent , they let_me know immediately my item was dispatched , and even sent an_email_saying it had been delivered showing my signature , wow technology .
2	would highly_recommend this company to all znd will for sure be using again .
2	thanks .
2	stumbled_across this web_site and have been amazingly surprised with cost and quality .
2	don_'_t have to look elsewhere for much else .
2	have used twice and they have been the cheapest on both_occasions .
2	quick delivery and answered questions by return e_mail .
2	found the site user_friendly , it was clear ever for a woman !
2	prices very comparable , will use them again
2	very impressed with gadgetpanda , great communication and fast payment .
2	would recommend to everyone !
2	prompt deliveries , great customer service , fabulous products ; great value for money
2	0_days of use and the fabric split .
2	the company said it was not their responsibility and washed their hands of it .
2	this is hard to believe when i still have a bean_bag from ikea bought 0 years_ago which is still completely intact !
2	the product must be of very poor quality to break after 0_days of normal use , unless the split was already there .
2	either way - i would have hoped for a more appropriate and helpful response from the company .
2	i would recommend that you look elsewhere for your beanbag purchase .
2	ville klart handle_der igen !
2	forsinkelse på_min vare ... sender en mail - bum bum inder jeg får set mig om , så er_der svar og en løsning på mit problem .
2	perfekt og professionel service !
2	my grandchildren were delighted with their fancy_dress outfits which they have had so much fun with .
2	great quality , well sized , very good value for money .
2	i would highly_recommend it to anyone .
2	i bought a chromed corner fitment for bath toiletries and it is beautiful .
2	the unit is very well_designed and strong but elegant and practical .
2	it is much_sturdier_than the picture displays and comes with screws etc .
2	to fit it to the walls which is necessary as it does not balance by itself in the corner of the bath as cheaper flimsier ones do .
2	altogether a very good buy which i am happy to recommend and at a good price with very quick customer service and delivery .
2	to good to be true ?
2	not at all .
2	the service from trionic has_been second to non throughout the process from asking_questions , choosing the model , ordering , delivery and a phone_call to say it was on its way , as well as the helpful tips even after via_email .
2	best customer service i have every received .
2	i needed something very multi purpose to help me carry on living my life as i always had and even with the ever progressing , ever changing disease of multiple sclerosis this brilliant engineering masterpiece fits the bill .
2	when my balance is at its worst , i feel_confident that i have the support to ' keep on pushing '.
2	when my fingers won_'_t work , the easy push_button wheels are easy to get on or off or to change from city to off road rough terrain .
2	the seat is perfect for taking a break or even just for sitting in the garden after pulling out some weeds .
2	loading up a wet basket of washing to take to hang out on the line means not only do i have a means of transporting it outside , i also have the bar to help my balance when hanging it out .
2	i now do not have to struggle with walking_poles , carrying a bag , my dog leads , balls , dog poo bags , spare gloves or any of the other things i used to struggle with just to take my dogs to the fields .
2	in fact i now wish i played golf , so i could show off by looking very smart on the golf_course !
2	if you lead an active outdoor life but need some support , i would recommend this product without a blink of the eye .
2	easy to order and pay by paypal .
2	was a little_worried because i only got confirmation of payment from paypal and not from bedworld , so i wasn_'_t 000_% sure they were going to deliver on the day i chose but they did .
2	the mattress and pillows were packed very well , the delivery man was very polite and helpful and my son_loves the mattress .
2	i would use bedworld again and have recommended them to others .
2	good service bedworld , well_done .
2	always excellent value and service .
2	there is no other place with such low_prices , vasy choice of good products and free delivery .
2	highly_recommended
2	excellent all_round , well_packaged and very fast delivery
2	linens_ltd are a very good company to deal with .

2	i ordered on monday and the item was delivered on wednesday .
2	excellent service .
2	i was very impressed at the speed of delivery for the two swimming_costumes i purchased .

2	i was very impressed with parcel0go .
2	very easy to use web_site and very competitive_prices , much_cheaper_than royal_mail .
2	the parcel was collected on friday and was in australia on tuesday .

2	would highly_recommend everyone to use them .
2	just another baby is an extremely good company to deal with .
2	ordering was easy and delivery was quick .
2	i would recommend them to all my friends .
2	the thing i like most about e_bay is that its easy to get in touch with them if anything_goes_wrong with an order
2	glad i signed_up for this hassle_free
2	have bought a few things from amazon and the service has_been very good the only_thing i could criticise is that after i have received an item i have bought i get e_mails stating that i might be interested in buying them why ??
2	?
2	everything we have bought from made . com has_been well made and really good value .
2	lots of great designs to choose from too .
2	we did have an issue with an order that was cancelled incorrectly but it was dealt_with immediately and with care and politeness .
2	so all credit to the company for excellent customer service too .
2	you do have to wait for some items , as they are being made for you , but it is always well_worth the wait !
2	it '_s easy to shop from the website and all the furniture has an excellent information profile , with plenty of measurements to help you with sizing and details of exactly_what it '_s made from etc .
2	i have not had any_issues with faulty goods or had to send anything back , but i '_m_sure that they would rectify any_problems well .
2	i have confidence in this company , hence we have made several purchases .
2	i would definitely recommend them to you .

2	unfortunately i have had to use divorce on line twice .
2	their service and advice is second to non .
2	friendly , knowledgeable_staff and a quick service .
2	saved me thousands .
2	if you need a divorce these are the guys to trust .
2	started process in august and completed january .
2	if in doubt go for the managed package , it '_s simply not worth slowing the process down with mistakes .
2	i would like to say how easy and pain_free it was to order my new camera from digitalrev .
2	it was one of the best experience and the delivery was great , in fact the camera came earlier_than the date i was given .
2	the camera was packaged to perfection and i would and will use digitalrev again , again and again also i will recommend them to everyone i know .
2	i think lightbulbs direst is fab .
2	my first order with them was way back in 0000 and i '_ve been shopping with them since .
2	they stock a massive_range which is great because they have the bulbs i need in my lamp ( e00 ) and i had great difficulty_finding them anywhere_else .
2	i don_'_t even bother looking elsewhere now , just get them from them .
2	the delivery is quick and efficient , usually a couple of days_later and they have special_offers where you are given discounts and free delivery too .
2	i usually wait for the free delivery offers and stock up on bulbs then , because whilst they are very cheap the postage is almost £ 0 . 00 , so its good to save a bit where you can .
2	i would definitely recommend lightbulbs_direct , i '_ve never had any_issues with them .
2	i have given mazuma 0_stars because their service is brilliant , very quick and informative .
2	i posted my mobiles on friday ( i actually forgot to get ' proof of posting ' but they still got there safely anyway !)
2	on monday i received an e_- mail to say they had been received and were being processesed , and a few hours_later i received another e_- mail saying that payment had been processed .
2	the next_morning i checked my account on - line and the money was there .
2	wow !
2	i was so pleased and amazed it had all gone_through so very quick .
2	i have nothing bad to say at all about mazuma , quite the opposite they provide an excellent service which is first_class .
2	my son also sent his mobile in too , he got proof of posting !
2	lol !
2	unlike me !
2	and the processing of his mobile was the same as mine , quick efficient and all sorted within 0_days .
2	i definitely recommend mazuma to re - cycle your old_mobiles .
2	thanks mazuma x
2	i ordered some ray_ban glasses with prescription lenses , glasses came and they were perfect - the lenses were not .
2	totally my fault as i had misunderstood the tinting levels .
2	the prescription was perfect .
2	i was really happy with the glasses and so contacted the company and said i was happy to pay for new lenses but could they do with a darker tint etc .
2	cutting a long_story_short the customer representative that i dealt_with was second to none i have experienced , superb does not cover it .
2	i ended_up returning the glasses and received replacement glasses with new lenses with a perfect tint and was not even charged for them , better still i had returned back to dubai from my original location of the uk and they sent them to me free of charge .
2	needless to say i cannot recommend this company highly_enough for both the product and the serivce .
2	i will for sure be using them again .
2	many_thanks for the speedy turn - around on my order .
2	the goods were delivered very quickly and tracked by royal_mail who texted and e . mailed me to state when they would deliver .
2	great prices and high_quality goods .
2	thank_you very much .

2	i have been trying to replace the cover for our outback sapphire 0000 gas barbeque for over a year as the original one has disintegrated .
2	outback themselves no_longer seem to deal direct with the public online and the retail_outlets they recommend don_'_t stock the one i want ........ then after a year of searching i found the garden_xl site and there it was .... the elusive cover that they claimed would fit a number of models of outback gas barbeque .
2	i crossed my fingers , ordered one and waited .
2	i had a phone_call from a lovely lady explaining when my order would arrive and when it arrived on time , i was delighted to discover that it did fit my barbeque .
2	i am thrilled with garden_xl '_s product lines , their stock_levels , their customer service and their delivery .
2	fabulous !

2	it was fantastic value for money , good quality and was delivered promptly .
2	great service all_round !

2	i recently used thurgo to purchase a new dyson_vacuum_cleaner , they were the cheapest place for the model i wanted .

2	i ordered my shoes from shoetique late on in the day , i fully expected to have to wait a few_days for my purchase to arrive , especially as the postage was free .

2	i will definitely be shopping on this site again !
2	i was recently looking for a pink handbag to go with a wedding outfit and was struggling to find anything on any of the sites i usually use , in despair and frustration i used google images and started scrolling down the page .
2	my eyes hit upon a gorgeous pink imitation croc bright_pink bag , but it was so nice i thought it would be out of my price range .
2	i clicked the image and was taken to the spartoo website and was surprised to find it was actually very cheap .
2	i ordered and then awaited delivery .
2	spartoo emailed me to confirm my registration and purchase and my bag was here within a few_days .
2	i have since been back to the site a few_times and i have my eye on some new boots there next :) overall it was a very positive web shopping_experience .

2	i bought two great looking bunches of flowers from this rip_off company to be delivered on weds before christmas .
2	one bunch has still not arrived on boxing_day .
2	the other bunch was christmas tulips with thistles .
2	what actually arrived was two_bunches of white tulips that looked like they were on there last legs .
2	( no thistles ) the tulips started dropping petals the day after delivery so went in the bin .
2	after paying £_00 for two_bunches of flowers to recieve one bunch of poxy looking tulips is a complete_rip_off .
2	i contacted the live feed for the company but after my initial reply to my complaint the live feed suddenly went off line after i asked for a full_refund .
2	will give more detail when i have more time .
2	ordered frontline for my cats late_afternoon and the goods arrived by 00 . 00 a . m the next_morning .
2	excellent service . would recommend this company to my friends .
2	return_journey .
2	return flight cancelled as they wanted to triple the price after booking .
2	they then double charged for the outgoing flight ( after refusing to refund me ).
2	to prove this i had to send them a bank_statement .
2	they refunded me one of the charges ( out of two ) without bothering to tell me or answer my questions so right now i have no idea what remains booked and what doesn_'_t complete_joke .

2	i waited in as given the hour_slot .
2	usually they turn_up and give a good service .
2	however today they did not turn_up , no calling_card , nothing .
2	i read on there tracking site that they had called and i was not in , they had left a calling_card .
2	i rang them , quite politely informed them that this was not so .
2	they had the nerve to tell me the the van_driver had called and left a calling_card .
2	they claimed they had proof and had taken a photograph .
2	i asked for this to be forwarded .
2	surprise it was a picture of another house , no apology just an expectation that i would be in tomorrow and lose money waiting for them to probably get it wrong again .
2	fantastic quality product , super_fast delivery lovely gift box with love hearts being a special touch , i will be purchasing from you again and also spresding the word of a reliable and trusted_seller .
2	in august we purchased a hotpoint dynd0000 washing_machine .
2	the weekend before christmas it stopped_working mid cycle .
2	we contacted " know how " that is a joke , we had to wait 0_days for an engineer to be told " oh we don_'_t carry that module as it rarely goes_wrong .
2	left with a promise to ring his " mate " who has one on his van and would ring in an_hour . you guessed it , nothing .
2	my husband spent up to an_hour on monday the day he first visited to get through to this know nothing depsrtment only to be told they would contact him to get him to contact us .
2	a waste of an_hour and goodness know how much for the 0000 number .
2	he rang again on the tuesday , waited for 00_minutes to be told that the module had to be ordered and they would contact us with a new appointment date .
2	we rang this afternoon as we had heard_nothing but after 00_minutes of waiting he put the phone down .
2	this so obviously how they keep their profits up .
2	i am tearing my hair out with frustration , it has now been 00 days without the machine and god_knows_how much longer it will be .
2	i emailed the customer_services ( there is no way you can talk to anyone in that department )
2	and demanded a full_refund as i was sold an item " not fit for purpose " i am still_waiting .
2	we are both disabled and cant lug bags and bags of washing to a launderette .
2	at the moment i want to hit somebody , i am so frustrated and depressed .
2	no matter_how much you will save by buying on line dont !!!
2	!
2	any item where you may have to use the " knowhow " customer service line in currys or p . c .
2	world whether bought in store or on line , don_'_t , don_'_t , don_'_t , if you value you sanity
2	previous dealing was with the nottingham branch who i found more than helpful so there are a few staff that can do what they can .
2	tried to order affipro on my usual site but had difficulty signing in as they keep changing my pass work .
2	looked elsewhere and found animal_direct .
2	great service and communication and the items were even cheaper_than the previous site !
2	this will be my site of preference in the future .
2	highly_recommend to animal_owners .

2	she dealt_with each one , efficiently and friendly and i never felt stupid at any time .
2	i certainly would recommend .
2	thankyou so much to jessica
2	this company is an_absolute_joke - the sales_staff are useless lazy arrogant bunch of shysters who can '_t be bothered answering the phone cos they know your call will eventually go through to a call_centre , i was told by the a person_who actually rang me to discuss my complaint that " the sales managers tell staff not to answer the the phone if there are customers in the shop " !!!!!!!!!????????
2	what a great customer_relations policy .
2	he promised me a return call from the complaints_dept .- it '_s 00_hours waiting now .
2	i hope i don_'_t die before i get that call .
2	after_reading complaints here and on cpw '_s own website i am not even going to bother pursuing this complaint with this bunch of incompetent untrained , couldn_'_t care less idiots .
2	so their complaints policy " i couldn_'_t give a s ** t ." works !.
2	obviously , more incompetent shambles - less pursued complaints !.
2	steer_clear save_yourself a load of hassle .
2	i have been ebaying for a few_years and switched to collectplus when rm changed their prices in april_0000 .
2	i '_ve now decided never to use collectplus again after having 0 parcels smash , another thrown over the gate and left in front_garden ( clothing ) and 0 parcel had been tampered with - customer claimed that parcel ( mail bag - clothing ) had been slashed opened with something sharp .
2	i have been sending pyrex for years with rm and have never had a breakage .
2	i bubble_wrap really well , use strong boxes , pad them out and fill all voids ....... can '_t imagine what collectplus do with the parcels .
2	i '_ve given collectplus too many chances and just can '_t take the risk any more - my ebay feedback is too important to me .
2	the couriers and staff at the hub really need to take more care and until they can get that sorted i will switch to myhermes .
2	i have earned cashback just by login to topcashback first think you should too my family love it think you too would xx
2	if you have ever wanted to obtain the games we played as children , jaques , is a must , to visit , i promise you will not come away without purchasing , and you will keep going back .

2	have used this site 0 times for my tyres for the past 0 years with no_problems .
2	they have premium and lower end tyres but keep going for the premium type as what you pay is what you get , plus the price is all in with no extras for valves / balancing / fitting .
2	from_start of search to completion , fast communications , calls and posted documents all arrived when notified they would .
2	pleasant helpful staff , i was kept_informed every_step of the way which made it easier than i thought it would be .

2	i wanted to order a * surprise * gift for the hubby , he is a guitarist though long since retired , he still enjoys playing for his own amusement ( and mine at times ) he had always wanted something he could record himself on , then play around with whatever musicians play around with ,, i had no idea what to order so emailed gear0music directly explaining my dilemma , adding that it was a * for fun * gift so didnt want to pay too much , i had an answer and great advice with 00_hours , and have ordered said item , i dont_bother with the * quick * delivery as , living in northern_ireland , i know from experience the dates given for delivery can be outside those dates , i feel gear0music are being wrongly maligned re delivery dates , its the courier service to blame not this company , have used gear0music in the past and have no doubts will do so again !!
2	thanks oliver for the advice !!
2	!
2	received everything thing but one item , which i had to email several_times to get a reply for .
2	to be told it was with ups .
2	when i checked with ups they informed me not had to order .
2	and sent me proof to say was cancelled .
2	0 emails later i get informed will look into it .
2	now its apparently back with ups .
2	so will see if it arrives .
2	but other than that good .
2	need items for tuesday as it for a birthday_present
2	shopped with grindstore for a couple of years_now and found the website very easy to use and the odd time i have had to phone customer service they have always been helpful .
2	definately recommend .
2	finding what you want is easy , ordering is simple , delivery is speedy .
2	what more could you ask ?
2	simply brilliant !
2	my parcel was delivered very speedily , but after ringing the doorbell on our three - storey house , the delvery driver hardly gave my husband any time to get down the two flights of stairs from the top floor ( which he did immediately on hearing the doorbell ) before he had taken the parcel to a neighbour '_s house .
2	my husband then opened the door to find his parcel being handed_over to a neighbour with no wrapping on it , so that everyone could see that it was a sad daylight therapy lamp !!
2	as he is unwell , and would not have wanted people to know that this is what was being delivered , he was very upset that the package had no wrapper .
2	why did this happen ?
2	fantastic service from these_guys , recomend them highly
2	this is the third parcel in a row that '_s taken ages to deliver . yes i too have the message on the tracking service , card left , which is never in my door , then next_day unable to find . my last parcel of knitting wool from turkey was in my local_depot the very next_day from dispatch . and then took 0 working_days to get 00 miles up the road . customer_services are rude and unhelpful , and my local_depot never answers the phone or replies to messages left . i have made formal complaints on their forms but never_heard back . in future i will find out who the seller will use to deliver my parcel before i buy .
2	the whole_experience from paying for the shed to receiving it was seamless !
2	the delivery people were great they helped move the shed to a secure_place .
2	the shed is great value for money and we highly_recommend this company !
2	brought a marshall town trowel great price !
2	will definitely use this company again !

2	i received a phone_call early friday_morning to say that my appointment was booked between 0pm & 0pm , which suited me as i could get back from work in time .
2	adam the lovely mechanic was really helpful and explained the work he had done and recommended we changed the other two tyres within the next few_months .

2	the company have fully refunded my money as a result of the delay and sent me a new frame .
2	the response was very quick and very apologetic .
2	thank_you .
2	shoes delivered next_day in perfect_condition , with a text to let_me know parcel had arrived .
2	below is a letter i sent to the ceo of the company to which he has replied but not carried_out any of what he said he would do .
2	dear mr lindsay
2	to say that i am disappointed would be a great understatement .
2	i have just had to suffer 00_hours without electricity due to utility_warehouse ’_s non - existent out of hours support .
2	this has come at a time when with a family funeral yesterday and having my daughter and 0 month_old_grandson staying with me ( both with heart conditions ), i was forced to try to find them other accommodation nearby due to the lack of light , heating and hot_water .
2	the problem_arose because of a fault in the local sub - station which caused a surge that destroyed my meter .
2	as this was after 0 :_00pm , it was impossible to contact anyone at utility_warehouse to ask for assistance .
2	i contacted uk power networks which is our local electricity distributer and they came out and checked my main fuse and confirmed that electricity was back on and coming to the house but that the meter was disabled .
2	my house was the only one in my street and even the whole village that was without power once the sub - station issue was resolved .
2	uk power networks said that the meter was your responsibility and had to be replaced by utility_warehouse as the supplier .
2	this left me in a ridiculous situation because utility_warehouse doesn ’_t have an out of hours service and so i couldn ’_t reach anyone to arrange for the meter to be replaced .
2	i used my neighbour ’_s computer to search your internet and this is what i found .
2	what should i do if i have no gas and / or electricity ?
2	“ please call our prepayment team on 0000 000 0000 .
2	they ' re available monday - friday 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 and saturday 0000 - 00 : 00 .
2	if you require emergency advice at any other times please contact your local electricity distributor ”
2	the electrical distributor is uk power networks , so i was back to square one .
2	i have lost food in 0 freezers that are in the garage – our chest_freezer and one freezer full of burgers for a cub event that i am organising for 0_weeks ’ time and also lost food in my fridge_freezer indoors .
2	i did show your distributor this last night .
2	additionally i have lost £_00 of credit on my key meter and key which has not been transferred to my new meter , and £_00 . 00 for a day i could not go to work , also the cost of 0 letters sent via_recorded delivery .
2	i find it unbelievable that there isn_’_t an_emergency contact point within utility_warehouse when something like this happens – the fitter who was eventually sent to replace the meter yesterday lunchtime said that he was available and on call the night before as lowie beck were aware of the situation with the substation fire .
2	if i had managed to get_hold of someone from uw he would have been able to replace my meter within 0 hours .
2	instead due to your lack of duty of care i had to suffer 00_hours with no electricity and significant discomfort , hardship and stress .
2	i think that it is a shameful situation that could so easily have been avoided if your company had only had an_emergency service in place instead of just relying_on the other_companies .
2	as they said it isn_’_t their responsibility !
2	i telephoned your customer service yesterday at approx .
2	00 . 00 lunch_time , i spoke to joy in prepayment , i told her of my situation and i asked that a manger call me back within the hour .
2	it is now 00_hours after that call to your company and i have not received any phone_call whatsoever from your company .
2	i want to know how i will be compensated for this horrific experience – i was told that the customer service would be excellent with utility_warehouse and my family and i have been scarred by this experience .
2	i need to feel that somebody there cares_about what has happened .
2	and i also think the thousands of your customers that put you in the position you are in are made fully_aware that if their meter goes_wrong ( as mine did through no fault of mine ) that they will have to ensure it is between the hours of 0am and 0 . 00pm .
2	you have a major floor within your company which should never have happened and it certainly should have never happened to me and my family .
2	my uw distributor was the only person i could get_hold of and even he couldn ’_t help me because you had no out of hours contact .
2	i look_forward to hearing from you .
2	very happy with the service , products , price and delivery .
2	all in all one very happy customer and will recommend and use again and again .
2	the tea is absolutely_brilliant .
2	the taste is subline and very good for me .
2	bought 0 mother and child lamps a year_ago next month , one broke_down a few_months_ago litecraft sent a replacement within 0 week .
2	the second one broke_down a couple of weeks_ago , no problem to
2	litecraft a replacement within a fews days of receiving the broken one
2	what better service could you ask for , thanks litecraft .

2	ordered plate food savers and they are a godsend for someone with mobility_problems .
2	have purchased them before from a local mobility store but these were more_expensive than from complete_care and there were 0 per pack which is sensible .
2	would now purchase further items from the complete_care catalogue instead of going to a mobility store and having_difficulty parking - just wait for the postman - it '_s almost as quick .
2	just as_described , very quick delivery .
2	will certainly use again .

2	i ordered a kartell componibili storage_unit from this ' designer living specialist '.
2	i paid for it , waited for it to come and was very patient when there was a delay in sending it to the uk , where i live .
2	in short , i have not received the item .
2	there was ( apparently ) an attempted delivery one day when i was out at work .
2	since then , i have emailed at_least 0 times a day to try and find out how i can receive it .
2	they refuse to give me a phone number or contact details for the carrier service , dhl .
2	when i tried_calling dhl uk myself , they said they were ' acting as a third_party ' and couldn_'_t help me , or give me any other phone number .
2	ambiente '_s only reply is that i can ' collect the item from my next ( sic ) post_office '.
2	when i responded asking where that might be , and whether they meant a dhl delivery depot rather_than the royal_mail , there was silence .
2	since then i have received no reply to any of my communications .
2	basically , they don_'_t want to know .
2	they have my money and presumably , in the end , the item will get sent back to them .
2	i was a little_worried_about having an expensive bottle shipped to my home address but needn_'_t having worried at all .
2	quick easy to use , delivered safely and in no time at all .
2	will use again !!
2	!
2	had never used printerland before so i checked online reviews first .

2	informed both expedia and budget car_hire i and that of associates would never ever use either organisation again nor that of our associates , which i happy to report from last_year is successfully achieved .

2	fast delivery .
2	well_packaged .
2	was a bit disappointed when i got a message that my item wasn_'_t in stock but before i had time to organise something_else i got another message that the item had been despatched .
2	it was here in a few_days & is a top product at a very reasonable_price .
2	would definitely shop_here again .
2	i had a damaged fridge_freezer delivered yesterday by currys ( knowhow ) & didn_'_t get a whiff of an_apology when i rang to arrange its return .
2	i then had another delivered by appliancedeals this morning .
2	all went to plan .
2	delivery man rang an_hour before to confirm time .
2	they let_me unpack the item to make_sure i didn_'_t have another duffer .
2	then the icing_on the cake was that within 0 hours they rang me to get feedback on my experience with the delivery so they could feedback to their staff .
2	00 out of 00 for both customer & staff consideration .
2	have been very happy from the day my colour_swatch arrived ( very professionally presented ) to the day my vertical_blind arrived within the 0_days promised .
2	very well_packaged .
2	all parts present & undamaged .
2	sufficient instructions ( btw very easy to install ).
2	worth_noting : if attaching to solid walls the fittings provided are fine , however , if you ' re fitting to a plasterboard recess it would be advisable to buy appropriate raw_plugs to ensure they '_ll hold the weight - available at any diy_store .
2	i have used transglobal 0 times_now over the past 0_yrs to sent parcels to my son who is now living in the us .
2	on each occasions the parcel has_been delivered within in 0 / 0 day window without problems , and the parcel can be tracked at all times from pick_up to delivery .
2	the company charge much less_than parcelforce , dhl and many other carriers .
2	i will_continue to use this company on many more occasions without a doubt .
2	i have been looking for a barbour_jacket like this one fo a while now .
2	could not believe the discounted_price 😀.
2	the jacket fits really well and looks so smart and also trendy .
2	i know there are a lot of cheaper replicas about but you cannot_beat the real_thing .
2	these fitflops are super , and very blingy , you will love them .
2	the price was a steal and they were delivered the next_day .
2	and the packaging was excellent .
2	would not_hesitate to do_business with jules_b again .
2	thanks .
2	the next_day delivery was superb , told you exactly_what time your parcel was being delivered so no waiting in all day .
2	the service via emails was very imformative and kept you up to date with everything .
2	excellent product at a very competitive price .
2	i would have no_problems recommending this retailer to my friends .
2	from the moment of purchase i was kept_fully up to date at all times with my order process .
2	delivery was fast and the prices were very reasonable .
2	ordered & paid for bathroom on monday 00th_feb , was told on the dispatch date , wed_00th_feb , that delivery company would be in touch within next 0_days .... still_waiting and this is day 0 !!
2	i have tried telephoning better_bathrooms , was kept waiting with no reply for 00mins , i have emailed better_bathrooms customer_services and had no reply .
2	had further orders to place such as tiles and accessories inorder to complete the room ... will be going else where .
2	only_reason there is 0_star is because i was impressed with the original advert and price !
2	!
2	why does this company not respond to emails and promise 00 hour turnaround when they clearly haven_'_t the capacity to do so ?
2	i '_m wondering_if the good reviews are posted by friends ?
2	my ref no ends in 00 - rotten_apples .
2	please send it back , i '_ve already wasted £_00 on a contract i haven_'_t been able to use .
2	very pretty design and super_fast delivery
2	always efficient and when they didn_'_t have a product i ordered emailed me and suggested an excellent alternative .
2	delivery was very slow , i had to contact them to find out about delivery .
2	i couldn_'_t leave a phone message as the box was full twice .
2	when item finally arrived it wasn_'_t suitable and they had the audacity to deduct 00_% from my refund .
2	overall i was dissapointed and wouldn_'_t use them again
2	it waseasy to use
2	i found the web_site easy to use and products quick to find .
2	i quite_often need the products i order at the point that i order them , so speedy delivery is important to me .
2	my physique products have always arrived the next_day .
2	i '_m not really sure what i expected from ready - prepared food .
2	its only something i ever use in an_emergency as all meals in our house are home cooked from scratch .
2	my husband , who has coeliac_disease , took the opportunity to try one of the chicken dishes while i was away for a couple of days .
2	that '_s the best way he said he could describe it - ok but nothing special .
2	he felt that it lacked something - a bit bland in fact .
2	he has several others to try which i purchased for him , but he is very discerning about food , more so since he has had coeliac_disease .
2	i honestly do not think though that he would want me to buy this product for him again .
2	found ffx when searching for this dewalt_drill for my husband .
2	although i had never_heard of ffx up to this point , ( and i am always sceptical_about buying from a company unknown to me !)
2	it turned_out to be an excellent choice .
2	as well as this being the most competitive price online , the product was delivered next_day at no extra_charge .
2	my husband is also very impressed with the product , as once the battery was fully charged , it lasted way beyond the sort of time other cordless drills have run before having to recharge the battery .
2	an excellent company and an excellent product and i / we will definitely look at ffx first when we require any other tools for our business .
2	we have received terrible service from city_link over and over again .
2	they seldom deliver next_day and very recently my parcel was just_dumped in a farmyard about a mile_away from our house .
2	perishable goods were ruined .
2	more often than not we have to do a 00 miles round_trip to collect goods which we have been urgently expecting .
2	they are a total let_down and i would not advise anyone to seriously_consider_using them for their business or personal requirements .
2	i '_ve_used animed a couple of times_now and will_continue to do so .
2	will recommend to anyone without_reservation .
2	the whole_process only took a few_minutes from the comfort of my home .
2	appointment was booked automatically .
2	very impressed with the garage who fitted the tyres .
2	will definitley use blackcircles again .
2	i would definitely recommend f00 to friends and would use them again without_hesitation .
2	would fully recommend this company for ink_cartridges , my canon_printer would say it didn_'_t recognise the new cartridges but print anyway so i think its my printer being a t * t rather_than the the cartridges themselves .
2	i always use the bags they include to recycle the old cartridges as well so doing my bit for the environment ..* polishes halo *..
2	on the whole , disappointing .
2	i have bought items from this site and the quality , fit and availablity leave a lot to be desired .
2	the sizing sucks , theres never anything decent for anyone a 00 or over and anything i have managed to get into didn_'_t last long once washed and the shoes have worn out quicker_than the wind changes direction .
2	definitely a get what you pay for site ..
2	excellent product , just what i was looking for for my daughters fish she bought for herself last_year .
2	she_loves it , especially the light :)
2	needed a product for my cats cystitis , last trip to the vet stung me for £_00 which hurt :( so tried this site and my bank_account gave a sigh of relief plus the cats happier and not peeing everywhere any more .
2	definitely will recommend on .
2	does what it says on the tin .
2	i have tried a lot of bingo_sites , this is definitely best one online , lots of bingo_rooms to suit your pocket and loads of slots friendly chat_hosts and added_bonus of free bingo_rooms where you can win real cash , give it a go you won_'_t be disappointed .
2	this is first time i have sold my phone and i am glad i chose mazuma .
2	the day after i put my details online i received posting instructions .
2	i popped the parcel in the box ( thursday ) and received my cheque on the saturday , excellent !
2	would have no_hesitation in using mazuma again
2	absolutely_delighted with company .
2	only small order but very quick in delivering .
2	i purchased amongst other small items , a personalised_banner which exceeded my expectations , totally impressed and great value too !!
2	!
2	spellbound perfume , fantastic price .
2	first_class service .
2	very happy
2	easy to order , product at good price and delivery very fast .
2	will be using again and telling my friends where to buy their product .
2	well_done
2	placed order at a great price compared to elsewhere .
2	received quickly , a very smooth_transaction .
2	will definitely use you again
2	i too ordered yesterday and my jacket arrived 00 oclock this morning .
2	fantastic service and my berghaus_jacket is great .
2	all items arrived very promptly and the door is beautifully made .
2	“ bought my dining_set from your uddingston store .
2	salesman , [_name ], was extremely_helpful and polite .
2	furniture arrived within a week and did not disappoint .
2	well_packaged , beautiful table and chairs .
2	delighted with your service from_start to finish !”
2	it didn_'_t really work for my purposes but there was nothing wrong with the product and the delivery was fast and efficient .
2	i always recommend goodprint to the companies and freelancers i deal with and where my words_fail me , the cards i '_m handing out speak volumes .
2	the substantial thickness , interesting designs , customer service , easy instructions and reliable delivery all make goodprint the best in my book .
2	prompt and reliable service , i would recommend them , easy online booking and confirmation texts where useful .
2	wouldn_'_t_hesitate to use them again .
2	my order was sent to milton_keynes rang them up i had to post there order to them and they sent mine to me , not what you want 0_days b0 xmas , thankfully we were honest poeple , not what you pay for ,
2	i wanted a canvas picture for my oh '_s christmas_present , and wowcher had a promo for just this .
2	paid my money , got my voucher , uploaded the photo and feel i got stung on the pp , but a month later , no goods .
2	i emailed wowcher two_weeks_ago asking how i go about chasing my goods , but no reply .
2	today i have emailed again , but am giving up hope of getting the canvas in time for christmas which is one month away .
2	i have lost out money i cannot_afford , and learned a lesson .
2	stick to sites i can_trust .
2	wowcher - disappointed with the poor service from your provider and your customer_services
2	never_heard of way to stay but were recommended by my sister .
2	booking was easy , website great , and very clear and informative email_confirmation .
2	would definitely use this company again .
2	ordered a replacement trampoline net at the weekend - free delivery and a great price .
2	it arrived on tuesday - very quick .
2	and it looks like it is very good quality so i am delighted .
2	will use this company again .
2	very pleased with the quality and price of these products and delivery too .
2	ordered two items , a duvet_set and a toaster on the 00th_december and was due to be delivered on the 00th .
2	i had the option of choosing another date so had it delayed until the 00th for convenience .
2	had an_email this morning to advise time of delivery within one hour .
2	goods extremely well_packed .
2	well_done .
2	good service and communication .
2	good prices too .
2	wasn_'_t expecting such a superb keyboard .
2	great key sounds , and good size keys too .
2	i am really over the moon with this purchase , it '_s good value for money , there '_s nothing cheap and nasty about it , a really great addition to our home .
2	the kids_love it and i love it .
2	got it standing in the front room where we can all play on it and learn till our hearts_content !
2	mustn '_t forget the fast delivery , thanks guys .
2	such a simple and quick procedure and was also given a good price .
2	money was paid into my account on the day promised .
2	would highly_recommend to anyone .
2	was dissapointed that the toilet_seat was rather on the small side and also no instructions with it but the money it is good value and comfortable .
2	i found supplement_warehouse . com by a fluke !
2	but i am not complaining !
2	!
2	recommending it to anyone who is buying supplements , protein mix etc , is a given yes !
2	the prices are so much_better_than what i know i can get in the store , so it pays for me to order this way .
2	in the past i have emailed the company with questions and gotten responses in a timely_manner which shows great customer service which to me is one of the biggest parts of sales , no matter what they are .
2	please check them out it is so worth the time and little_effort it will take as their web_site is friendly and easy to maneuver through .
2	ordered tumble_dryer on the monday - delivered on wednesday free of charge - was sent a text_telling_me the time_slot for delivery - turned_up within the first hours of that time_slot .
2	very efficient .
2	the order was correct and delivery was swift .
2	appropriately_packaged for item
2	i have ordered two amazing evening dresses from this site , and one of the dresses i was unsure_about the sizing , so i called the store , who were sooo amazing helpful , and i ordered the two dresses ......
2	they are totally breath taking and she advised me right on the sizing .....
2	they came the next_day delivery , and i couldn_'_t be more delighted ......
2	thank_you .....
2	i booked my last holiday through a0 travel , who were extremely thorough , let_me ask all the questions i needed to feel happy to book , then the whole_process was easy and efficient .
2	had a fantastic holiday , exactly as booked ....
2	if every company ran as efficiently as mazumba , the country would be alot better !!!!
2	what an amazing , efficient , and fast service .
2	well_done to all the directors and staff at mazuma , as whatever you are doing , you are doing it so well .
2	keep_up the fab work .
2	thoroughly thoroughly_recommend .
2	i have not seen the flowers but have been told their absolutely georgeous .
2	after a week when my order did not arrive i contacted medicanimal and was told my order had been delivered , eventually i was told it had been delivered to the wrong_address and it would be collected and redelivered .
2	this never happened , my partner went to the address it was delivered to and was told it had been collected the same day , i was then told it had gone back to the warehouse as the bag was torn !
2	i had to but food as i had not got my delivery , when i complained i was told to scan over the receipt which i did but still no sign of my refund .
2	having spent over a hundred_pound i am very disappointed with the service .
2	i doubt i will use this company again , mistakes_happen but to be told two different stories does not give one confidence in the company .
2	i did eventually receive my goods .
2	i wish i had found this company sooner , the quality of the goods are amazing , delivery is fast within three_days .
2	when i '_m complemented on my shoes i take great pride in saying they cost me £ 0 . 00 .
2	well_done
2	i buy all my products from this company , the service is fast and efficient , the deliveries are quick and i intend to get all my supplies delivered by the automatic system which i think is brilliant .
2	i have recommended this company to several of my fiends .
2	i have bought several items so i can spend quality time with my grandchildren , each one has given us all a lot of pleasure and makes coming to nanny '_s good fun while they are learning .
2	the goods arrived very promptly , would recommend
2	my first time using double0tickets . com , very easy site & managed to buy some excellent seats for the o0 .
2	tickets arrived special delivery & in plenty of time , will_definately be using this site again & recommending to friends !
2	my order arrived really quickly , and i was so impressed that i was straight back on line to order another .
2	excellent quality at a really reasonable_price .
2	i will be back !
2	i will recommend
2	you to everybody was very helpful and good in the job and quick
2	friendly and efficient engineer
2	easy and straight_forward .
2	free_postage , fast delivery and a lot_cheaper_than buying at the vets ,
2	i had to order more ink_cartridges the other day , so i reordered from cartridge_sales , again i was very happy with the price & the service !
2	the cartridges were here the next_day , i would be happy to recommend this company to anyone who needs cartridges in a hurry .
2	great fast service , fair price and delivery would definitely use again and recommend to others
2	very fast delivery , good company
2	i telephoned this co to order the motorbike gloves my son wanted for christmas on 00th_december to ascertain when they would arrive ( so i knew which address to send them to - my work , home or my son '_s home ) - they immediately checked to see they had the gloves in stock and then promised me that they would ensure the gloves were sent that day and delivered the next - and that is in fact what happened , the gloves arrived safe and sound the next_day with text_updates from the delivery co as to exactly when the gloves would be delivered .
2	fabulous , friendly and efficient service - i was very impressed and wouldn ; t_hesitate to recommend this company .
2	my order arrived immediately - despatch was amazingly quick and the prices are excellent !
2	i have been shopping with animed now for a little while , deliveries are always made within or before their notified time frame and prices are excellent .
2	they are my first_port of call when shopping for the animals now ...
2	i ordered my dog '_s food at between 0 . 00 and 0 . 00pm wednesday - it was delivered before 00 am thursday !
2	not much more than 00_hours between order and delivery !
2	very very impressive !
2	!
2	i ordered some prescription food for my dog - delivery was fast , flexible - they followed instructions as to where i wanted the food left - and i was kept_fully_informed by petmeds both by e_- mail and text_message - text_message was voluntary if you don ; t want it you don ; t have to have it !
2	i was very impressed and won ; t_hesitate to use petmeds again !
2	my order was despatched promptly and was exactly_what was ordered .
2	no need to contact customer_services at all
2	i know that venue owners can rig their rating and that a disgruntled customer can post unfair posts but , touch_wood , as yet i have not been disappointed with any of the places i have booked through trip_advisor and have found it very useful .
2	good prices and range of pet_supplies all ordered from the comfort of home .
2	will use again .
2	having been an existing customer of this company i decided to use them for a vet prescription purchase ( to avoid the 000_% mark up at the vets as its long_term medication ) i understand they cannot dispense meds without the hard_copy prescription so posted 0st_class on sunday expecting at the very latest tuesday receipt ?
2	i paid for my order on the sunday and therefore expected my order to be prepared ready for the prescription receipt which was marked urgent complete with order number to avoid any delays in matching it with my already paid for order .
2	i also emailed daily sometimes twice to ensure vetsuk got the message i needed the medication urgently for my sick pet .
2	there is no phone contact listed !
2	they responded to each email_saying they had not received my prescription through the post until thursday ( 0st_class mail ???)
2	i wish i had got signed for at the post_office but didn_'_t think necessary at the time ?
2	i received an_email friday to say that my order ( several other items have been ordered ) was due to be dispatched .
2	i rang them after receipt of the invoice showing a telephone_number .
2	i complained about the length of time it had taken to dispense and despatch my urgent order and asked them to upgrade to next_day which_meant saturday delivery ?
2	they dont do weekend delivery using dpd !!
2	i am still_waiting for the delivery and have had to sort interim pain_relief .
2	never again will i use this company they could have helped_me by ensuring my order was dispatched quickly with all the contact i have made but they just didn_'_t care !!!
2	!
2	having shopped on the internet for years i got caught out buying from this supplier after checking their " excellent reviews "????
2	ordered an ipad on 00 / 00 / 00 showing in stock , 0 / 00 days delivery , credit_card debited_immediately !
2	suffice to say , no goods arrived after several emails of promises , can '_t get through to helpline , always in a queue .
2	i have finally cancelled the order 00 / 00 /_0000 and would rather pay more and get the goods immediately from a reputable_company .
2	i was offered a screen_protector and upgraded delivery ( laughable if not infuriating ).
2	am awaiting a refund although i have already contacted my credit_card provider to put the sale in dispute ...
2	i will also be looking to report to trading_standards .
2	had a great night with rod_stewart thanks to double 0 tickets really good seats , excellent view would definatley book with them again ,
2	no_problems at all with blue sun tree .
2	they told me how long the delivery was and it was pretty_much spot_on !
2	delivery very smooth .
2	would not_hesitate to use again or recommend .
2	asked to cancel coconut chair after delivery was postponed same as everyone else on this site !
2	someone called and said i couldn_'_t cancel until the 00 week delivery deadline .
2	i asked then that someone give me a call back at 00 weeks .
2	they did call me back and confirmed that yes i could now cancel the item and that i would get my refund within 00 days .
2	i know , this is probably the same conversation that a lot of people have had with them and no refund is forthcoming .
2	i am going to give them the benefit of the doubt and see what_happens in 00 days .
2	will review again in 00 days !
2	wanted to update my review to say that my money was never forthcoming in_spite of customer_services saying they would chase the finance_department .
2	got in touch with barclaycard who have refunded me the money and will be pursuing infurn to get their money back .
2	if you paid on credit_card do get in touch with them as they may be able to help .
2	how does a company like this stay in business .
2	they take your money and never deliver the goods .
2	i placed an order on 0st_november .
2	after a month started to wonder where the canvas was and what was the problem .
2	called their_offices and was told it would be sent in the next few_days .
2	next phone_call was told it had left their_offices and was on its way .
2	never arrived .
2	called again and was told will be sent out in few_days .
2	asked for someone to call me back as i wanted a refund as i didn_'_t_believe a word of what they were saying .
2	of course nobody called back and have had no refund .
2	if you are considering using this company don_'_t .
2	there are companies out there who are a pleasure to deal with and deliver what they say they will .
2	this company is not one of them !
2	this radiator was a great price in comparison to many other_companies .
2	the delivery was so quick .
2	still in box at the moment so can '_t comment on quality but it looks good .
2	needed two new rear_tyres for my car .
2	so easy to put in registration_number and choose the tyres appropriate for my car .
2	next the easy step of booking in the car for fitting .
2	got the date i wanted and time .
2	what more could i ask for !
2	all confirmed by email with booking_reference .
2	easy as that !
2	would definately come_back to this site for future tyres .
2	if the fitting_centre works as easily the whole_thing would have been a breeze but that still remains to be seen as i have yet to have them fitted .
2	booked top price tickets back in september , 0 month before event informed that my seats are no_longer available and i have been moved to alternative seating which are 0 block further away and also in a different price bracket .
2	i phoned and emailed them regarding this but they insist the tickets are of the same value , even_though if you try to book on their website the block i have now been allocated is £_00 . 00 cheaper_than what i originally paid !
2	now with one week to go they say that they are unable to help me further and if i am still not happy to contact the promoters , this is a complete_joke .
2	i will now wait_until i attend the concert and see if i can sort anything out then , but i will never use this company again , complete_shambles .
2	may i also point out that this has happened to my friend for a different concert , booked great seats and then moved to just ok ones , i am beginning to think they sell the best seats and then move you so they can sell the good seats again !!
2	avoid if you want a hassle_free booking .
2	besr price i could find and believe me a do search hard . very quick delivery , will definitely use again
2	i love using collect_+ - very simple and straightforward to use with fast delivery and excellent customer service .
2	recently , an item was damaged in transit .
2	instead of a lengthy , drawn_out process , a simple on - line request meant i could answer a few questions - what i was sending , packaging used etc - and include some photographs .
2	i sent request in on sunday 00th and by monday 00th ( in the morning !)
2	had received a reply with the offer of a full_refund to be paid by cheque - fantastic .
2	on another occasion , i got home and realised store assistant had only scanned one package - when i rang , it was too late , the van had gone .
2	a quick call ( to a real_person !)
2	enabled the assistant to confirm that the driver had scanned the package and it was safely on the van , item arrived on time and safely .
2	cannot recommend highly_enough - thanks to all concerned
2	easy to order , quick delivery , easy to install & works well .
2	what more can i say ?
2	ordered a book , came quickly was as expected .
2	no_complaints .
2	excellent service and value for money .
2	clean car and driver who was very courteous and helpful .
2	will_definately use again and advise others to use them too .
2	we use milk and more for our small business unit serving 0 people and found the ordering of product to be very good .
2	we have a delivery of milk every other day and top it up with other items in between a big food shop .
2	have no_reservations_about recommending m & m to anyone .
2	we hired a renault espace for two_weeks from perpignan airport .
2	the vehicle was brand_new and immaculate , the handover friendly and very quick , and the booking and payment process simple and efficient .
2	i was very impressed and will use carhire_0000 again .
2	the best photos i have had from any event and quick polite staff well_done de !
2	we decided to order trophies and medals for our inaugural college badminton tournament .
2	however , our limited_budget meant we had to shop around to get the best prices .
2	trophy_store offered a brilliant selection at good prices ; when i rang customer_services about the order , their response was courteous , friendly and helpful .
2	as we had put in the order a day late , we had not expected to arrive in - time for our competition , but trophy_store surpassed our expectations and the parcel arrived well_packaged and a day earlier ( with tracking )
2	we will be ordering from trophy_store again for future events ; for the record , our order included an award for each person in a pair ; so two trophies and four medals ( and ribbons - didn_'_t realise these cost extra but worth it in the end ).
2	i would particularly recommend the bronze badminton medal as a product - the detail was very good and had a decent weight to it , so overall a very lovely feel - more so than the gold - plated medal .
2	i searched many sites and then i found easy shed , the shed i picked ticked all the boxes that i required .
2	the shed arrived quickly and professionally erected by 0 polite men that worked quickly , and made sure my requirements were fully met .
2	the men removed all packaging and rubbish and took it with them , all in all very satisfactory .
2	i was also impressed with the follow_up e_-_mails from easy shed checking that i was satisfied with the shed , & if any_problems to let them know immediately , but with the information in the e_-_mails i had no need to contact them as they listed everything i might need to know .
2	i would fully recommend easy shed for their professionalism and the quality of their products .
2	vio_vet are an excellent company .
2	they are always quick with delivery and the prices are good .
2	well_done vio_vet keep_up the good work .
2	i have a love - hate relationship with damart : their goods are excellent quality but the service is really bad .
2	in_spite of myself , i keep shopping online with them although i know i will have problems with delivery .
2	goods are late or get lost ; damart doesn_'_t tell you whether items are in stock or not ( or the info is wrong ); they don_'_t send a message to tell you that goods or dispatched or when you can expect them .
2	in brief , you order and then you wait ... one week , two_weeks , three_weeks , four_weeks ... and the goods might suddenly appear .
2	the call_centre cannot answer any_questions about delivery .
2	so unfortunately damart really does not meet standards online shoppers expect : tracking , fast delivery , accurate stock info .
2	but damart sells good stuff !
2	if only they could update their website and improve their distribution !!
2	!
2	i have often bought goods online from land '_s end .
2	i have no_complaints whatsoever .
2	the goods are always as_described ; the prices are fair ; the quality is excellent .
2	the garments are not high fashion but they are very useful wardrobe essentials especially for outdoor life .
2	returns and refunds are handled very well .
2	i can wholeheartedly_recommend land '_s end .
2	i have bought many items from this store over the past few_years : cameras , lenses , filters , bags , accessories ...
2	the service is always fantastic ; delivery is fast ; any phone query is answered_promptly .
2	if an item is not in stock , the company phones me and lets me know when it will be available .
2	i have also traded in goods and found the company to be fair and fast in its price offer .
2	the range on offer is very comprehensive and the goods are of superb quality .
2	in short , the best online supplier of photographic goods in my opinion !
2	i ordered dog boots and dog blankets for over_£_00 .
2	i received a message to say the boots were not in stock ; however , they were debited from my account and in_spite of a promise to refund , they were never refunded .
2	i returned the dog blankets as the sizes were wrong .
2	however , i have never received a refund for my returns , sent by royal_mail recorded delivery .
2	the website does not give a phone number or email address for the company .
2	it can only be contacted by its own contact form .
2	in short , they make themselves rather unreachable .
2	i agree with the other reviewer that the website looks very professional but the actual service does not back this up .
2	i have contacted them again to ask for my money back .
2	if i do not get a refund , i will contact trading_standards about this company .
2	i can '_t praise this supplier enough .
2	webtogs doesn_'_t charge for delivery - not even to the remote_areas of scotland - and they never make a fuss about returns and refunds .
2	they also keep the customer very well informed via_email : confirmation of order , despatch , receipt of returns .
2	i keep returning to them again and again for their excellent service .
2	they also have quite a good variety of outdoor and travel goods .
2	i purchased 0 oak bedside_cabinets .
2	it was a totally smooth_transaction from_start to delivery .
2	the cabinets look even better in real_life than they do in the pictures .
2	the price was amazing and i searched far and wide before purchasing them and i couldn_'_t get anything like them for the price i paid on the high_street or on line .
2	i would highly_recommend this company and will definitely be buying from them again .
2	bringing a little_bit of the cotswold to cornwall !
2	since i have had an account with very i placed my orders and had my goods delivered next_day which is amazing , it meets my needs as i am a very busy person and last_minute shopping is just excellent as i can collect my items ordered the next_day without hassle . on one occasion i had to do some returns and with no problem just returned to the same store that i collected and was refunded immediately .
2	very is very good .
2	go on , now that you read my review hope it helps to put confidence in very .
2	it was a perfume since i have been using since my early 00 '_s . its the best fragrance . thank_you very much fragrance_direct for making my day .
2	its money worth spending , its one product you can never go_wrong . its one of the best thing you can own . the hair is amazingly shiny and gives the beautiful finish .
2	as stated the item was received in time . i am very proud to do_business with hifi_tower . i have actively been looking for bargains to purchase the barbeque , and finally_managed to buy the product thanks to hifi towers .
2	its of good quality and would recommend any future customeers who read my review to purchase from hifi towers .
2	its a brilliant product and the customer service is excellent . they also resolve any_issues instantly .
2	i have used select_specs for a number of years and because of the quality and price , find myself collecting lots of pairs of glasses .
2	they are a professional company who really offer great customer service .
2	very easy to find what i wanted , and pleased to find they had the product with the preferred requirements which i was looking for .
2	that is : ' green coffee bean extract should have at_least 0 , 000 mg per serving .
2	a good product also needs to have 00_% or more gca '.
2	excellent !!
2	i am thrilled .
2	i always check several sites before i commit to buy my supplements ( and i buy quite a few !)
2	but i find i invariably come_back to simply_supplements because :
2	they have a huge product range .
2	the bogof_offer makes everything good value .
2	i trust their product quality over and above anything you can buy on the high_street .
2	my orders arrive very quickly .
2	and quite_frankly simply_supplements are head and shoulders_above the rest - they are the best !
2	!
2	what an excellent service !
2	thank_you .
2	i received my purchase very quickly and i am delighted with it .
2	i will certainly buy again and will recommend you to my friends .
2	i saw what looked to be a great deal when i was looking to service my mazda for full service and mot .
2	a quick search on google_search_engine and up popped service stop winners of dragon '_s den !
2	impressed ?
2	car was picked_up as arranged would be returned between 0 and 0 pm .
2	we will contact you if there are any_problems , so far so good .
2	! 0 : 00_hours phone_call from service stop " we have sent you an_email with a pro_forma invoice ", " ok i will have a look ad get back to you ".
2	to my horror i find that there are a few jobs needed to be done to get it through the mot 0 .
2	cut in tyre at off side rear cost to repair £_00 . 00 +_vat £_000 .
2	0 , the other 0 tyres have nails in them ?
2	£_00 headlamps too low £_00 to re set them .
2	brake_discs worn and pitted £_000 ...... windscreen_wiper not clearing windscreen properly the list_goes on ..... total_cost £_000 . 00 !!!!!!!!
2	phoned them back and told them i will get the work done elsewhere and just pay for the service and mot greed £_000 as they wont release the car until you have paid !!
2	i paid by credit_card and waited for it to be brought back at the agreed time .. 0 to 0pm it got to 00 : 00 no sign of car ring them .
2	" stuck in traffic " 00 : 00 where is my car ?
2	" round the corner ."
2	with you soon .
2	00 : 00 where are you with my car !
2	i '_m going to ring police my car has_been stolen !!
2	oh the drivers just leaving the garage now ' darling ',!
2	now they are lying and patronising me !
2	car finally arrives at 00 : 00 i '_m fuming .
2	poor driver got the brunt of my anger ( he only collects and delivers )
2	i went to get tyres checked .
2	0 needed_replacing .
2	lights were ok as were the brake_discs the wiper needed adjusting .
2	but i got it replaced total_cost for all this ..... £_00 took it myself to the garage service stop had taken it to and it passed .
2	i told them what i thought and as a gesture of goodwill they cleaned the car ( which should have been included anyway !)
2	had i been less assertive i could have been conned_into getting un necessary work done at an extortionate cost i will definitely not be using them again i will however be contacting_trading_standards !!
2	steer_clear
2	the fragrance i ordered for my son came well_packaged and the delivery was as always prompt .
2	since my initial_contact the staff have been most helpful and have explained the process every_step of the way .
2	when any_queries have arisen they have gone out of their way to assist .
2	i would be happy to recomend the service they provide to anyone who asked .
2	i am enrolling for a course i brought and couldn_'_t redeem voucher , one call to e careers with david and it was sorted
2	i like my dogs to have quality , healthy food , and angell_petco provides that .
2	i swapped from fish0dogs to angell_petco 0_months_ago , and whilst i would recommend both , angell just edges it for me .
2	i believe fish based kibble to be the healthiest choice , plus easier to control weight .
2	both_times i have ordered i '_ve been offered next_day delivery , with the opportunity to change it to a more convenient day if required .
2	excellent service !
2	took delivery of shaker style chairs today and they are everything i hoped for and more .
2	they look good and are very comfortable .
2	your service has_been fantastic throughout and the delivery men were courteous , efficient , checked everything before they left and took the packaging away .
2	i have to say that i was apprehensive placing an order over the internet to a company i knew nothing about .
2	however , you have exceeded my expectations on all levels and i would definitely recommend you and use you again .

2	the fitter called ahead to let_me know that he would arrive between 0000 - 0000 and he was here at 0000 .
2	the service i received was first_class with a smile which goes a long way !
2	a very friendly guy , and very efficient too .

2	i ordered the camera i wanted and received an_email back saying it was out of stock and to let them know if i wanted an_alternative .
2	as i wanted the camera i '_d ordered , i didn_'_t respond .
2	i received an_email a couple of days_later to say that my order had been despatched that day , and i received it the following_morning .
2	as i had fully expected to have to wait a while for the camera to be back in stock , i was really amazed_at the speed it arrived .
2	i would definitely recommend bestcameras to family and friends and will purchase from them again myself .
2	excellent except when they close your account for security_reasons when there is totally no reason .

2	quick and easy ordering as well and reasonable_prices .
2	i '_d say you would be happy with flowers from iflorist .
2	this is the second time recently that we have used partmaster and on both_occasions we have had an excellent service delivery was on time .
2	our order arrived today , at 0am on a very cold and frosty_morning .
2	from the quercus range : 0 display cabinets , a sideboard and three bedside_tables .
2	it arrived on time , with a courtesy_call to let_me know that the lorry was 00_minutes away which was great .
2	the delivery drivers were simply the best that it has_been my priviledge to deal with .
2	when the lorry arrived there were cars_parked in our short cul_de sac that made it tricky for the lorry to get in .
2	the chaps made no mention of this being a problem and one of them simply appeared , described what they would do and then went_ahead and wheeled the furniture up the road from the lorry which was parked out of sight somewhere around the corner .
2	it took several trips , and it was bitterly cold !
2	the two gentlemen were an_absolute credit to your company and a pleasure to do_business with .
2	once unpacked , we were pleasantly_surprised to find that the quality and condition of the furniture matched that of the delivery - better_than_expected , but just what we had hoped for !
2	we shall_certainly recommend oak_furniture_land to our friends , family and colleagues .
2	with best_wishes to you and your teams for a very happy christmas and a prosperous 0000 !
2	have been a loyal_customer of orange for many_years , yet when i have a problem customer_services don_'_t want to know .
2	i am very seriously_considering moving to another_provider , orange has_gone so far down in my estimation .
2	from the very rude person in an orange shop to being told that my problem will be sorted_out , what they didn_'_t say was ' when they will be bothered to help resolve this problem '.
2	very poor battery life , keypad so small you keep hitting the wrong letters on the samsung_galaxy mini , i can '_t even connect to my email address .
2	bad customer_services , my score would be 0 / 00 .
2	can '_t fault service i recieved from animed and happily_recommend them to all .

2	the goods have always arrived next_day and in perfect_condition with no " out of stock " nonsense .
2	i have sent a few e_- mail queries to them about product details and these have always been answered_promptly .
2	prices are very competitive and in some cases they are cheaper_than anyone_else by quite a margin .
2	a real joy to deal with , i '_d give them 0_stars if i could .
2	just as heading_says .
2	received sony ps0 bluetooth headset quickly in_spite of the terrible_weather at christmas .

2	goods delivered the next_day , exactly as_discribed , and very competativly priced .
2	i have been waiting for my order to be processes for 00 days now and it still has not been done .
2	when i link on to website my order is saying in progress .. it never gets any further .
2	i have emailed loads of times and just get fobbed_off with " i will look into why the delay ".. but no one ever does .
2	their website says 00_% of orders despatched within 0_days ..
2	this is one big joke !
2	i am still_waiting for my order to even get to the quality control dept .. never mind being shipped .
2	buyer_beware ...
2	this company is rubbish .
2	they take your money and order ..
2	the leave you waiting .

2	i ordered my ladies 0000s gi lady costume on monday_evening and it arrived on wednesday_morning .
2	i recommended the company to another couple of friends and they too received excellent service .
2	the costume was just as illustrated and was much_admired at the event i went to .
2	my only_criticism was that the hat was on the small side and so difficult to wear .
2	i '_ve_used viovet to get prescription_medication for my elderly_dog .
2	the process is clear and the tablets are about half the price than buying from the vet .
2	customer service is good and they are very efficient at processing orders .
2	i '_ve been using this company for a few_years_now and whenever i need something for my phone i always find it at mobilefun .
2	they ' re products are excellent , good value for money and with excellent customer service .
2	very good service from_start to finish with a very competitive price .
2	i shall look at your site again for my next electrical purchase .
2	i had a quote from a high_street store , but thought i would check on the web , and came_across betterbathrooms and their january_sale .
2	as it seemed to offer far better value than the quote i had , i thought i would take a chance , even_though i had seen the quality of the goods in the high_street .
2	as it turned_out the quality is better , the prices were better , our entire order ( bath , loo , vanity_unit , taps etc ) arrived within a week , and the standard of communication form the company , and the courier , was excellent .
2	i '_m so glad we found better_bathrooms , and i will recommend them to anyone who will listen .
2	i was looking for a small button battery for a very old toy .... found it here at the best price , on a very clear , user_friendly site .
2	the prices were so good that i was tempted into buying some bulk packs of aa and aaas - the ordering process was very straightforward , and everything arrived within 00_hours , even over new year .
2	wonderful !!
2	!
2	i ordered a pc from pcspecialist who informed me when it was ready for despatch and that dpd would deliver the next_day .
2	when you are working , or have other committments , deliveries can be a pain when you have no idea what time of day they are going to arrive ... dpd sent a text , giving us a one hour time frame for estimated delivery .
2	the driver arrived within this window , and was friendly and helpful - and our pc was intact !!
2	have experienced other couriers recently who have delivered squashed boxes of plants ( labelled very fragile ), or left our new hi spec monitor propped against the hedge outside .... dpd did the job so much_better !!
2	!
2	i found pcspecialist when looking for a company to build a pc to our spec .
2	the website was easy to easy and the " virtual build " process very helpful , as my specification was checked immediately and the advice on changes for greater efficiency ( and saving money ) was very useful .
2	once we had ordered i had excellent communication by email .
2	we paid for an express build service , and our custom_built system was with us in 0_days !!
2	everything was fine , but when we did have a software issue , the service was excellent , and the problem_solved in a friendly and supportive way .
2	all this , and great value for money !
2	!
2	excellent service .
2	have used them a couple of times before with working phones but had one that was water_damaged to sell them as ' non - working '.
2	i filled in the online form , the next_day an envelope arrived for the despatch of the phone , the following_day i had confirmation that it had been received and the following_day my money was transferred straight_into my bank .
2	brilliant !
2	no_hesitation in recommending mazumamobile !
2	i have left orange after 00 years as a customer .
2	i had been without a signal at home for over three_weeks .
2	i had to use my bt landline to contact them as i had no signal at home .
2	this increased my bt phone bill by over_£_00 .
2	i have eventually had an acknowledgement of two emails from ceo '_s office whom i contacted after two_weeks .
2	i had so many promises broken by staff who were supposed to call me back , the signal was always ok at home until they joined with ee and t - mobile .
2	the staff in india are an_absolute_joke and were rude , surly and hung_up on me .
2	if i could have rated it lower_than 0_star i would have done .
2	i am now with o0 with great customer service and a functioning phone beside me on my sofa , great signal .
2	thanks o0 .
2	orange should be struck off or something !
2	!
2	i loved the cover , with my choice of photo covering front and back , with a selection of others inserted .
2	very inviting
2	i have used flubit for all my purchases that would have gone_through amazon since the autumn .
2	much more fun , always over 0 per_cent cheaper , at_least , i would say , and they just sent my last item for free , just because ...
2	what '_s not to like !
2	your web_site was good and easy to use
2	the item arrived 0_days form order .
2	the customer service was excellent
2	i like the site its still new as more and more people join then i know there will be more investing in the site just like all new ventures we need more advertising i like what you are doing with the free games give us a reason to log on every day will check it out free games ect or raffle tickets when we are in wewill look at all you have to offer so reel us in with more freebees

2	got it for cheaper here even with postage added .

2	really glad i found this site .

2	just found out that i '_m soon to have a grandson ' yay '. having had sisters and daughters the excitement is unbounded but looking at stores on the high_street the boys clothes are abysmal , fine if you want them to look like little old men or car mechanics .
2	i was amazed_at your ranges for the boys and i found online a beautiful sleep suit and hat with embroidered rainbows on to send as a ' well_done ' to my daughter ; she '_d wished on a star for my first grandaughter and jokingly said that the beautiful rainbow six_months_ago might herald her second child .... so rainbows are special .
2	can '_t wait for her to come and visit as we '_ll be hotfooting it to morpeth to pick boys clothes ... magic !
2	this shop was recommended and lived_up to its reputation , super prices , fast delivery and i was kept well informed on the progress . thank_you
2	never used blackcicles before , but they seemed to promise a good service at a fair price .
2	and thats exactly_what i got .
2	they ' re website was a doodle to navigate , the choice of tyres was excellent and the price was very competitive .
2	liked the e_mails_confirming both my order and appointment with my chosen tyre center .
2	good to know that if there was any_issues i already had a contact at blackcicles .
2	( not needed ).
2	i chose a premier tyre center to fit my tyres , fairly local as it goes and the service was second to none .
2	friendly , efficent and very proffesional .
2	if it '_s tyres your after i don_'_t think you '_ll go far wrong with blackcircles .

2	my first stop for sports_gear everytime .
2	price match with other_companies and fast shipping !

2	as soon as i ordered it i was so glad that i had , the service i received from buywise domestics was very quick , straight_forward and i was kept_informed every_step of the way . the last two washing_machines i have had have been zanussi '_s . they have been excellent which is why i wanted another one .
2	i looked_everywhere and this was by far the best deal online !
2	i will be highly recommending buywise domestics !
2	!

2	amazon well what can you say , they have everything and to be honest thier prices are good , yes the size and buying power governs but amazon is a force to be reckoned with !. the only problem i have had with them is i prefer royal_mail for my delivery company because my office is local and have never had a problem with them , i have had problems with other_companys and have e_- mailed them with my concerns . i would like to see a prefered courier option in the future . the products and selection is fantastic and the prices are good so always look at amazon i have had so many good bargins and as a prime member i dont pay postage its great !
2	have been shopping with healthspan for many_years , they have a wide_range of supplements to cover everyone '_s needs , the handy thing with healthspan is that they have all the infomation on each vitamin which you can access at all times , i would recommend healthspan to all , you can select what you want and pay for it then get it sent and most vits go through your letter_box how '_s that for service .

2	purchased a tablet from this company and had to return for repair , so far so good .
2	it came back and within a week was faulty again .
2	returned as per their instructions - april_0000 and no word from them since .
2	no response to support ticket ( which is now dead ) or to numerous_emails .
2	all negative_comments on facebook were taken off and there is now no means of commenting - a transparent company ?
2	i think not !
2	important to note : as of april_0000 jexaa limited was dissolved .
2	now trading under tablet gear limited - same director , same address .
2	interesting that i got a marketing email tonight from jexaa limited .
2	i have gone to watchdog .

2	i heard about boossh through_groupon and made an order .
2	the offer was so popular that groupon withdrew it as boossh couldn_'_t meet the 0 day postage that was included as part of the deal .
2	my initial disappointment was soon gone when boossh dealt_with this issue quickly and offered a discount to help me get started without the groupon offer .
2	i also received a call from boossh when fulfilling my order to apologise that a couple of items were out of stock and offering alternatives .
2	i received my order more quickly than_expected and was very impressed by this and the personal service i received .
2	i can '_t wait to get started .
2	i '_ve worked in a complaints_department of a large company for many_years and am passionate_about great customer service .
2	i can '_t fault boossh for the way they have dealt_with an issue not of their making and recognise their excellent customer service .
2	would highly_recommend !
2	an order placed on the 00st_december is still " processing " according to my account details .
2	the company failed to respond to a request to swap the item in order to get something for christmas and have failed to respond to a request since christmas to cancel the order and refund .
2	the web_site looks good but it accounts for nothing if the service is poor .
2	i won_'_t be using them again or recommending them .
2	i '_ve given then one star as it seems you cannot_rate them with zero_stars !
2	found what i was looking for immediately , it was quick and easy .
2	the website was so easy to use and ordering was a doddle .
2	the blind was exactly_what we required and the size was perfect , and it was a good price .

2	i was preparing to rearrange my plans for the day so that i could be in for delivery , however there was no need as the parcel arrived shortly_after 00 . 00 am .
2	i am delighted with the service both from dunelm and from yodel .

2	i wanted to get a parcel picked_up and delivered back to me .
2	the whole_process was cheap and simple i did it all on line - they picked_up when they said they would and delivered back to me the following_morning - what could be simpler !!
2	i would defiantely use again and now i can buy things from all_round the country !
2	!
2	i recently had fitted_wardrobes installed by sharps into a very tricky loft space in an edwardian mansion .
2	this meant they had to be sympathetic with the surroundings and the fact that the walls would not be straight etc ..
2	the service i recieved from the salesman , customer_services , planner , surveyor and fitter was excellent !!
2	not only that but they went into revcievership during this process and managed to keep me updated every_step of the way .
2	very firendly , lovely company .
2	i would defiantley use again and tell anyone who_wants to listen that they are the best :-)
2	i highly_recommend this company .
2	the two saucepans i ordered are of a very good quality and were delivered a day after ordering .
2	very quick . took about 0_days to receive the glasses after ordering .
2	very good price too & very good product .
2	the most_recent item i have purchased , a side table , i asked if it could be delivered to the fulham road store .
2	i was told by the girl in the store it would be ready for me to pick it up on a particular day when in fact it wouldn_'_t be there until 0_days_later .
2	i never received the promised call to tell me the item was ready for collection but had to call a couple of times myself .
2	if these sorts of issues could be ironed_out then i would have given a higher rating as i love the products .
2	wish i had read these reviews before i placed my order .
2	hope this will help others avoid same hassle .
2	ordered 0 cookers on a special price deal .
2	website showed stock and order was placed , credit_card charged .
2	delivery terms we '_ll call you within 0_days and delivery within 0_days .
2	no call after 0_days , checked website could still order item for 0 day delivery , so i called them .
2	sorry no stock can '_t tell you when we will have and someone will call you within 0_days - no joy beyond that .
2	eventually told delivery would be mid november - 0_weeks after ordering .
2	next_day item i had ordered was showing no stock on website , but noticed there was showing an identical item in another colour , colour not an issue with me so went into local_branch to try and change to other colour as i could get no where with phoning .
2	branch rang where ever and were told definitely no delivery on original item until nov .
2	branch then checked re other colour and identified would be 0 day delivery .
2	tried to persuade us to just go for other colour but i insisted they call up and check actual stock - again no stock will be mid nov .
2	manager of store then persuaded us to change to another brand - bush , these are owned by argos so we are never out of stock .
2	it was an inferior product , but you don_'_t order 0 cookers because you want them them it is because you need them .
2	so after being absolutely assured there was stock and we would receive them 0_days_later we placed a new order .
2	should have had my call yesterday to confirm time_slot , didn_'_t happen so i called today and was told yes all in order delivery will be tomorrow 0 - 00 . 00 and will call you on route - great .... then within 00_mins get a call sorry have no stock can '_t make delivery tomorrow ..... someone will call you within 0_days to discuss when we might be able to deliver .
2	insisted that wasn_'_t good enough but of course no way forward so now waiting for a call .
2	how can they think a call back within 0_days relating to an item that should have been with me within 0_days is acceptable ??
2	?
2	other customers might like to know i was told by a member of staff argos operate like an airline they sell stock they don_'_t have and so then have to bump people - great - how often do they expect us to be bumped before we bump them ?
2	.. and as good as the picture !
2	well_packed and delivery service was good .
2	two words i can think of .
2	the order was not what i wanted - my fault .
2	order arrived on time and refund was without_delay soon after the retuned item was received .
2	all communication was by email - very efficent , friendly and effective .
2	ordering was easy and delivery estimate great .
2	unfortunately their courier " lost " our doors .
2	the doors were remade and delivered very quickly .
2	customer service was perfect and the problem put right without_delay
2	switched to ocado after a series of disasters and lies from tesco and i have never for one second regretted it .
2	like all delivery services there are so many variables that can go_wrong , some they can control and some they can '_t .
2	either way when they have got it wrong ( and it '_s only a handful of times in over 000 deliveries ) they listen to you , apologise and put things right .
2	the little_touches are clever too , you actually feel_valued as a customer when you get a free ( and decent ) bottle of wine on your " shopping with ocado anniversary ".
2	price_wise they aren_'_t that much more_expensive and the delivery pass pays for itself .
2	we perused the website , easy !, with the help of several samples chose the perfect chesterfield for us , delivered on time and was even better_than we '_d expected .
2	the colour is fantastic and goes with our existing sofa and chair , perfect size and quite_frankly we just love it .
2	andy took the delivery of the sofa and also said the delivery men were very professional and was very happy with the service .
2	thank_you very much , saving up the pennies now to replace our other sofa and chair next year .
2	ali and andy

2	have used james_villas twice to stay in the same villa .
2	the villa_itself was perfect , the location stunning and the service provided by james_villas very good .
2	all booked on - line , no_problems with villa , car_hire or flights .
2	we didn_'_t see a rep but we didn_'_t need to - there was a villa manager who dealt_with any_problems and advised us on taxis etc .
2	he also cleaned the pool_area daily which we hadn_'_t expected .
2	highly_recommended .
2	i find myself coming_back again & again !
2	great company , great products , great prices and super lovely staff !
2	delivery was speedy and the delivery guys were friendly and helpful .
2	i highly_recommend buying your furniture here .

2	products were all as_described and in good order .
2	ordered goods at the beginning of december .
2	still not received by 00th_dec so cancelled order .
2	they then said order ready to send .
2	i told them i had cancelled it , they confirmed this in email on 00th_december and said refund would be in 0 to 00 days .
2	00 february - still_waiting for refund .
2	rang and emailed numerous_times - no reply to phone messages and emails keep saying refund is coming but it never does .
2	i was extremely apprehensive when i heard about supplement_warehouse .
2	i mean , they couldn_'_t possibly be as great as everyone says , right ?
2	there had to be a gimmick , right ?
2	but i gave them a try & waited .
2	the result : super - fast shipping ( very well - packaged ), tons of freebies ( not " crap " stuff , either ) & awesome closeout deals ( as good as they sounded !).
2	a fluke , i thought ... so i ordered again & actually found an item for slightly less on another site -- i got zero grief as they beat the price .
2	i even returned an item & again got a + customer service , & free return shipping !
2	final review : wow (& thanks !)
2	i bought the great - and very simple - ' sommelier ' corkscrew as a present who had liked my one .

2	i bought a selection of l ' oreal face care products at unbelievable prices plus a fantastic calvin_klein lipstick at a great price .

2	i ordered two items on a thursday and they arrived in plenty of time for me to give my brother - in - law the jumper that i had ordered for him when he came the following_tuesday !
2	he was delighted and so was i !
2	very quick delivery , received the day after i ordered .
2	great selection of products .
2	i wish i '_d found ezeframe years_ago .
2	i '_ve placed three orders so far and each one was perfect - frames made to my exact_measurements , quickly delivered and well_packed .
2	e_- mail and text_message lets you know when parcel will be delivered .
2	the web_site is very easy to use , and they have a great selection of frames and mounts .
2	if you are in need of a frame , mount , glazing or accessories i recommend ezeframe .
2	0 extremely polite gents 0 van , collected and delivered couldn_'_t ask for anymore first_class service .
2	appliances on line are a great company to deal with , web_site very good , even found a video review for the washing_machine .
2	very easy site to get around , ordered new_washing_machine , and was delivered on the day i requested , you can even track your order on line .
2	would highly_recommend this company
2	hqhair allows me to purchase some high end cosmetics that i can '_t get in australia at a fair price .
2	so far their service and communication has_been wonderful , usually my orders are shipped within a day and arrive in a timely_fashion in australia very well_packaged and in good condition .
2	i have never had a problem with them and would recommend them to everyone here in australia and the world .
2	we have been introduced to lots of excellent european city hotels in the last few_years thanks to expedia .
2	with competitive_rates , great rooms and convenient scheduled flights - we just keep_coming_back .

2	always buy from qtag due to speedy delivery and fact goods wash and wear well .
2	i ordered batteries for my home phone handsets .
2	within a few_days they arrived and wonderful i was back in contact with the world .
2	and listen to this , they are so cheap .
2	never again will i go into a local shop for any batteries .
2	could not believe_how good the service was .
2	they have every battery you want .
2	00out of 00 awarded .
2	why all the detrimental remarks .
2	i ordered a pasta machine 0 week_ago , phoned mon after_reading these reviews , and on wed i received my machine .
2	it is very good , a judge make and guaranteed for 00 years .
2	the gentleman on the phone was very pleasant and i thank him for the excellent service .
2	i will receommend you to everyone .

2	my review is for curries in yeovil , i ordered a product and paid for it on dec 00nd , there was no mention of the product not being sent to the store in time for xmas , after 0 attempts to collect it the last time on jan 0st and was told it still wasnt in i phoned the helpline , total_waste of time , all he kept saying was that it was in store waiting to be collected which it clearly wasnt , they wouldnt give me the store number so i had to keep going 00 miles just to see if it had arrived , i will never be using the store again and would highly_recomend using ao . com they were brilliant .....
2	very easy website , couldnt get over the amount of delivery choices , even on a sunday which was all free . i recieved a text_message half hr before and they turned_up bang_on time , the cooker hob was £_00 cheaper_than any where else , couldnt_ask for more in an internet company . well_done !

2	i ordered these from new_zealand so the high_level of communication was appreciated .
2	living in new_zealand and trying to organise getting a parcel sent out from the uk can be a tad frustrating .
2	i have used p0g for a while but always with the company organising it for me .
2	i decided to have a go at it myself this time and successfully managed to get it wrong ( my fault for trying to do it late at night ).
2	i was initially frustrated ( i seem to spend a lot of time frustrated - lol ) at not being_able to get_hold of p0g , but then had a brainwave and got them on facebook .
2	by messaging them i had a 0 on 0 with sam ( my hero ) who managed to correct my mistakes and sort_out the problems - ( which i had created ).
2	what was nice was the fact the i could instant message him so the problem got sorted quickly .
2	i am one very satisfied_customer :)
2	always prompt delivery and good prices
2	you can usually judge a company best by how it deals wiht issues , and my experince was excellent .
2	the scales i bought back in april developed a fault , i sent an_email , had an almost insatnt reply to check the address for collection and delivery of a replacement and bingo !
2	all sorted and in a charming and personal email conversation .
2	well_done jon and housewares online , thanks
2	i bought a preamp and i got it from this site on the recommendation of a friend who had used them before .
2	i nearly didn_'_t write a review ( because i '_m a bit lazy ) but i saw some bad_reviews on here so it '_s only fair i should add my good experience .
2	it just all went to plan .
2	the preamp was a great price , shipped on time , arrived promptly and i couldn_'_t have wanted anything more really .
2	i just wish i '_d bought it ages_ago as it '_s a fantastic little piece of kit !
2	i found printerland quite by_chance and have used them for all my printing needs ever_since .
2	they have never once let_me down and always delivered my orders the next_day , well_packaged and good quality products .
2	i had a faulty_cartridge once and needed to replace it - this was such an easy process and again , i had what i needed the very next_day .
2	all the staff on the phone are professional and friendly and i would not_hesitate in recommending this company .
2	i brought my first lot of stride plus from my vet as it was recommended for my dog it was over_£_00 when i needed a replacement i searced the net , it came up with viovet as the cheapest at under_£_00 , which is just great will_definatly recommend your company and will come_back again when i need replacment thank_you once again chris
2	i have used toolnet on several_occasions and have found
2	= their website is user_friendly and easy to navigate
2	= their prices are lower_than their_competitors
2	= goods are delivered in a timely_manner
2	= when i have needed more information the customer service team has answered my questions well !
2	!
2	i will definitely use them again and recommend them
2	found this company by searching the net for virkan scrubbing brushes - their site is easy to use , ordering process was fine - goods came correctly , and quickly .
2	we will be ordering again !
2	everything you want from small to large from family to friend gift perfect .
2	plenty of choice fast response delivered as requested not a fault anywhere .
2	i placed my order in an afternoon , and received it the next_day , all items as ordered , and at very competitive_prices .
2	what more could you ask for ?
2	the go - to place for all the fiddly bits you can '_t get anywhere_else , farnell '_s prices are usually ( for most items ) the best around , and with free delivery for all online orders , it '_s really a no - brainer as to whether to choose farnell or another_supplier .
2	even when items are out of stock , farnell will contact you promptly , so you can choose whether to wait for stock or cancel the order ; and free_postage doesn_'_t mean slow postage , it '_s usually within two_days maximum .
2	i '_ve been using this company for years , and have never yet had a bad_experience with them .
2	remember how food seemed to have more flavour when you were younger ?
2	well , forget about supermarket water - injected , flavourless , overpriced and unappetising meat and fish , and get the real deal from campbell '_s .
2	i really can '_t praise their produce highly_enough , whether it '_s beef , pork , lamb , poultry or fish , and the van der meys bacon is the best you '_ll ever taste .
2	it '_s also one of the very few places that i '_ve been able to find smoked ham houghs for making home - made lentil soup with .
2	delivery is reasonably_priced ( free if your order is over_£_00 ), and the produce arrives in perfect_condition in a chilled container .
2	so do your taste buds a favour , and try campbell '_s , you really won_'_t regret it .
2	on 00th_november i placed an order with this company , then received an e_- mail the following_day , to say the items were out of stock , and asking if i wanted to wait_until they were in stock .
2	as i needed the bulbs in a hurry , i replied that i would prefer to cancel the order and receive a refund .
2	come 00th_november , i still had no refund , so used the website '_s live_chat option to query the situation ( i still have the transcript for this ), and was assured that the refund would be made immediately .
2	yesterday , 00th_november , i still had no refund , so phoned the company to query the situation , and was again assured that an_immediate_refund would be made .
2	as of today , 00th_november , i still have no refund .
2	this is the worst service i have * ever * received from any online company in 00 years of internet ordering .
2	the only_reason i have given one star is that there is no option for no stars .
2	best prices around , huge_range of products , and fast ( and mainly free ) delivery .
2	why go_anywhere_else ?
2	i '_ve been buying here for years , and although i still check around whenever i need to buy , no - one beats ebuyer for range , price and reliable and fast delivery .
2	qed ;-)
2	will call again .
2	sevice brill .
2	prices very competative
2	easy to use , no technical problems and easy to find what you want .
2	as i live_abroad i use this site regularly to send flowers and plants to family and friends .
2	the web_site is easy to use and the service is brilliant .
2	i recently had to put a delivery on hold because a friend was taken into hospital but it was no problem .
2	i used the ' contact us ' sent an_email , got an_email back and adjusted the delivery as necessary .
2	really good service .
2	everyone who has received the flowers has said how lovely they are and \ i actually saw one of the plants which had been sent several months previously and it was blooming still !
2	must_try these as they are just what we have been looking for for ages .
2	will display our products perfectly and we will certainly be buying again .
2	i was really worried_about sending our high value ipad through the post on the promise that it was genuine and i thought about it for about 0_weeks .
2	once i had decided to take the risk , the offer had gone down by £_00 and i could kick_myself for delaying .
2	the money was in our bank_account within a very short_period of time and i would recommend anyone to use this site .
2	it is definitely genuine and i would definitely use them again .
2	this was by far the most professional advice i have ever recieved on this issue .
2	the service i was received was professional and prompt , and really helped_me make a decision about my future plans .
2	i would recommend this service to anybody in a similar_situation .
2	one of the best bingo site to date good payouts brilliant ch and a chance to make lots of
2	new friends from all over the place a really fun place to be .
2	quick delivery and a great product received
2	bottle / jar_opener
2	ordered for my mum and had it delivered to her home for her .
2	no_problems at all , highly_recommended .
2	after shopping in store with sainsburys for over 00 years_now buy groceries online .
2	with the exception of difficulties due to bad_weather i have found the service second to none .
2	highly_recommended
2	prompt service .
2	great quote for phone and freepost_envelope received very quickly .
2	highly delighted and would recommend to anyone .
2	washing_machine rendered_useless as door fell_off , had replaced door hinge last_year very successfully however seating for hinge was only plastic and clearly a weak point .
2	ordered new inner door rim , which arrived in time for my son to fix it while visiting .
2	a very quick job and now i have a functioning washer again - thank_goodness .
2	saved a pound compared to competitor , no big deal but service was equally good so pleased to have the pound in my pocket .
2	must_confess to using competitors ' how to ' video to solve my problem ; does this supplier have such helpful videos ?
2	?
2	good service
2	i was delighted with the refillable journal that i ordered for my daughter and so was she .
2	the aubergine colour was beautiful and the leather of good quality .
2	it was made just perfect by the addition of her initials .
2	i hope she has as much pleasure using it as i did giving it
2	my man has recently been_diagnosed with coeliac_disease and was disappointed on a daily_basis to rule out product after product that he could no_longer eat if he was to feel better .
2	he is a competent basic cook who_likes his traditional meals , not to mention a pint at the golf_club and a take away treat for an easy night off cooking .
2	so many things were ruled out and going out to eat is fraught with ' danger ' so imagine what a relief it is to find a company supplying blond beer and currys which are just as tasty as any non coeliac product .
2	i was particularly pleased to find it was a local company and their hamper has_proven a real_treat .
2	we will definitely be buying more from you , ilumi
2	again and again and again any thing to do with wheels or tyres ask cormac
2	i '_m really pleased with the rusults of laser_surgery .
2	i am able to play with my grand - daughter who is 00 months old without_worrying_about glassess getting broken .
2	i also go swimming once a week with my grand - daughter and love the fact that i can romp around with her and see her clearly and not worry again about glassess getting broken .
2	worth everypenny
2	ordered a present from them for my little_girl last christmas and am still_waiting they promised me it would be with me for christmas then just ignored emails and are impossible to reach by phone .
2	awful company and would agree they are con men , even if it '_s the cheapest or you can '_t get what yolu want anywhere_else i would avoid them like the plague or put your money in the fire it '_s the same thing .
2	only gave them a star because i couldn_'_t post unless i did believe me they don_'_t rate at all .
2	after a mammoth search for good quality furniture we paid indigo a visit after finding them on the internet .
2	it was well_worth the journey , the furniture is fantastic we bought all_sorts and i am so happy with it the quality is second to none .
2	the sales_staff are helpful without being_pushy and the after sales is great delivery was on time and the guys who delivered could not do enough for us .
2	if your looking for exceptional quality and service i would recommend indigo without_hesitation .
2	fab !
2	i bought a sale item , it was clearly described and very quickly delivered .
2	now that you can use their tool to measure your_own pd , you don_'_t have to wait for a varifocal kit to be delivered , the whole_process is so quick .
2	this makes ordering varicfocal glasses from perfect glasses a ' no_brainer ', as they are about a quarter of the price of a high_street store , but , in my opinion , twice the quality .
2	i ordered ' reactions ', the ones that change in different light conditions , and they really are excellent .
2	i was delighted to find somewhere to buy quality flea and tick_treatment at a reasonable_price , and to get such speedy delivery .
2	i would definitely use this website again .
2	great price , delivered next_day , couldn_'_t be better .
2	swift delivery and easy to use .
2	have recommended to a number of friends !
2	we had been looking in local_shops , national chain_stores and on the internet until we eventually found castlegate_lights in google .
2	immediately we found what we wanted , and at a very good price .. we ordered late in the day , but the goods arrived the following_morning , and we were completely_satisfied with the appearance and quality .
2	just what we wanted .
2	the goods were delivered fast and correctly .
2	i like the free_p_&_p weekends .
2	that '_s when i order from cpc .
2	some goods are uneconomic if i '_ve got to pay for carriage .
2	bought my battery on the 00rd_jan , when i rang on the 00st i was told by a very rude girl that they had trouble with their courier and my battery was not dispatched until 00th .
2	very rude_unhelpful staff , because of their problems i have had to pay over_£_00 in public_transport costs .
2	avoid at all costs
2	excellent service
2	cartridges arrived very promptly , order form was easty to complete .
2	would reccommend them to others
2	happy with price and speed and speed of delivery .
2	goods arrived well_packed .
2	will use again and recommend to friends .
2	it was the first time i had used iflorist and was a bit_apprehensive as they were for a funeral and to be delivered directly to the funeral_directors .
2	i was informed that the order had been allocated to a local_florist .
2	i rang the funeral_directors the morning of the funeral and was informed that the flowers had been delivered bright and early .
2	the florist they had used had made a cracking job . they had lovingly produced the arrangement , which was the " thinking of you " one in medium .
2	it was really beautiful .
2	far_exceeded my expectations .
2	i did get an_email later to say the flowers had been delivered .
2	i would not_hesitate in using iflorist in the future or recommending them to anyone_else .
2	first_class !
2	i was a bit_apprehensive_about ordering a tumble_dryer from this company .
2	but after being let_down by one of the better known companies i found " simply appliances " had the one i wanted at a very good price .
2	i ordered it on friday and they were very polite .
2	went to check if they had one in stock and said they would deliver it on the monday .
2	( to north notts ).
2	i said i didn_'_t want to give my card_details .
2	terry was very nice and said a cheque or cash would be fine on delivery .
2	on the monday i phoned to see if it was still going to be delivered and terry said he would phone me back to give me an estimated time when he had contacted the driver .
2	which he did and said it would be late_afternoon to early evening .
2	when 0 p . m arrived and no delivery i had given up .
2	but true to his word he arrived at 0 . 00 p . m and apologised for being late .
2	he brought the dryer into the bungalow and took all the packing off so i could check it .
2	he said if i had any_problems to get in touch .
2	it works very well and was a very good price to what some companies are charging .
2	so i would not_hesitate to use them again or recommend them to anyone_else .
2	well_done " simply appliances " .
2	keep_up the good work .
2	i would rate them 0_stars .
2	i ordered a flame failure device for my cannon gas_cooker main oven .
2	i checked beforehand that the model_number was correct .
2	.
2	the part they sent me did not state it was for the grill and top oven .
2	after returning it and waiting for my refund .
2	i had to ring on two occassions .
2	the second time the woman_who answered had a very bad telephone_manner .
2	very offhanded .
2	i then was put through to a manager at my request to ask why i was charged two lots of postage .£ 0 . 00 for delivery and returning the item .
2	when it wasn_'_t my fault .
2	?
2	they didn_'_t state it was for the top oven and not the main one .
2	as the gas_fitter travelled some considerable distance to fit the part neither him or myself were very pleased .
2	i do not recommend this firm at all .
2	no star_rating !!
2	!
2	booked the private_transfer and it was worth_every_penny no_problems at either end would definitely recommend .
2	i dithered as to whom to chose to place my order with but boy ... am i pleased i trusted my order with salonskincare .
2	fair prices and excellent delivery .
2	i will most certainly be placing my orders with them again in the future .
2	thanks a lot .
2	pamela
2	the service and advice received from lintbells is second to none .
2	their products truly do deliver what they say on the pack !
2	not gimmicky .
2	my ' mature ' border_collies have benefitted considerably on yumove and yumega over the last few_years .
2	so much so that i personally commenced imove shortly_after it became_available .
2	i am staggered at the response i have had to it .
2	so much so even my consultant orthopaedic surgeon has advised me to continue and will review me in a year '_s time !!!
2	i would strongly_recommend this company and their products to anyone - without_hesitation .

2	we just bought two outwell camping beds from taunton which we needed in a hurry .
2	everything went through smoothly and they arrived on the day we needed them .
2	great camping beds - comfortable and a good size for children and adults_alike .
2	i was recommended the owners direct site by a friend and have subsequently used it to look for a last_minute weekend over christmas and a summer break .
2	at first i was slightly_worried_about having to liaise with owners to work out availability .
2	however , it worked really well and even in mid - december , owners were responded to my availability requests really quickly so it was very easy to narrow_down choices over a 00 h period .
2	we rented a gorgeous villa in italy for a summer_holiday - the owners ( based in edinburgh ) were really helpful and every_aspect of booking , getting directions and keys etc worked smoothly .
2	we will definitely come_back to the site to look for other holiday_destinations as there is so much choice .
2	found just the right led lighting for my kitchen .
2	great price .
2	delivered promptly and very well_packed .
2	easy website .
2	would highly_recommend and will definitely use again with no_reservations .
2	really pleased ... ordered 0 different items from 0 different suppliers .. garden0less arrived next_day .. way ahead of other company .... well_done good service quick and easy to order on line ....
2	thank_you
2	easy ordering , delivery excellent , product simple to assemble & good value .
2	excellent service ...... highly_recommended
2	i wanted to buy a digital_piano but was unsure what to look for .
2	graham_howard '_s knowledge and expertise walked me through the process so i knew what to look for and how to ask intelligent questions .
2	when i walked_into the store , i was now an educated consumer !
2	i purchased a beautiful kawai cn00 digital_piano and have been loving this piano since the day it came to our home !
2	thanks for all your great advice , graham !
2	this was the third time i '_ve_used mazuma and they were just as efficient this time as the first time .
2	i have used mazumamobile before when selling an old phone .
2	the price quoted for my iphone was not as high as some other_companies but i decided to use mazuma as i remember that they were very good the last time i used them .
2	after registering my phone '_s details on their website , i waited for my bag to arrive , which took two_days .
2	i sent my phone by special delivery to mazuma on a thursday_lunchtime .
2	on friday_morning ( the very next_day ) i received an_email_saying that the phone had been received and processed .
2	a few hours_later i received another email_saying that i had been paid ( i had chosen to be paid by bank_transfer ).
2	i checked my bank_account and sure enough my money was there .
2	this is fantastic service , i cannot_fault it at all !
2	i had the money in my bank_account 00_hours after_posting my phone to mazuma .
2	maybe the service is a little_slower if they have busy_periods but i would never use a different company .
2	well_done mazuma !
2	!
2	i ordered a camera 00 days before i needed it for my holiday as it was meant to be 00_hours delivery .
2	i had an_email the next_day to say the camera had been dispatched and giving me a tracking_number .
2	the next_day i tried to track my camera ( being delivered by dhl ).
2	dhl told me that they had received the data for the package but no package and told me to talk to pixmania .
2	this was a vicious circle , pixmania said they had sent it but dhl hadn_'_t received it .
2	i asked pixmania to send me a replacement but they refused .
2	i asked for a refund but they refused .
2	i received the memory_card which i had ordered along with a vipix card which i did not order .
2	this had been added to my invoice (£_00 . 00 ) and there was nowhere i could cancel it .
2	i rang pixmania to ask them to cancel it but they said they couldn_'_t - the card would give me cheaper postage for the next year !
2	!
2	as i had paid by paypal , and 00 days had passed i logged a complaint with paypal .
2	i eventually had all of my money refunded by paypal today , a month after my order .
2	the camera never showed up and i did not receive any explanation from pixmania .
2	i would never use them again and never recommend them to anyone !
2	wrong product sent , no reply to emails .
2	chris and the staff at iconic and still trying to locate a watch for me however in the meantime they got a fantastic chopard diamond_necklace at an excellent discount .
2	the service , payment through to delivery and communication were all excellent .
2	happy to recommend them and i will be using them again in the near_future , thanks to chris and the rest of the staff at iconic .

2	i ordered a necklace for my granddaughters bday .

2	but i they dont mention the fact its shipped from the usa !
2	i have asked for refund but havent got that yet , so im very dissaponted with the service , they should be providing tracking for their items .
2	not a good service i wont_be using again !
2	ive had lots and lots of things from lightinthebox and every_single item has_been just as_described and exactly_what i wanted , they have arrived on time in perfect_condition , you couldnt want anything more , you should simply try becouse once you do i really beleive you will carry on buying from lightinthebox ,
2	ordered 0 lsa champagne_flutes .
2	by far the best price for these glasses .
2	the delivery service was great .
2	tracked delivery and delivered ahead of schedule .
2	beautfully packaged - wish i got a the champagne company box every day lol .
2	very happy to recommend this company .
2	bought a pair of north_face mittens .
2	postage was £ 0 . 00 tracked courier guaranteed delivery with an_hour_window .
2	was told they would be delivered on 00th_jan but they never turned_up .
2	couldn_'_t get any answer by ringing or by email from e_- outdoor .
2	got an_email this morning to say the courier would come today which they duly did , but yesterday was a totally wasted day when it needn_'_t have been .
2	so a tainted first experience .
2	this was a great trouble - free transaction and great price too .
2	bought two berghaus coats .
2	cheapest we found !
2	quick delivery too .
2	have used titmuss own_brand dry_dog_food for some time now and have never been let_down by them in terms of delivery .
2	the food is great , excellent value , and the delivery always comes within two_days of ordering .
2	everything you look for in an online supplier .
2	this guitar was very nice , but didn_'_t realise when i ordered from yourselves that with my son being very tall , the guitar i picked was to small for him , i sent this back right away to you at high tower , as my son had gone out and bought a guitar for himself anyway .
2	on returning the guitar , i had no_problems , and my money went back into my account .
2	would i use high tower again the answer would be yes .
2	there service is very accurate , prompt , and the delivery was very quick .

2	i have been shopping with littlewoods for over 00 years , and i can_honestly_say , i would not go with anyone_else .
2	goods (£_00 . 00 total ) ordered 00 june 00 , confirmation received same day , chased 0 july with numerous attempted phone_calls in between and since .
2	these people are cheats and worse , we are pensioners .
2	this fraudulency needs lots of publicity to get these people out of business .
2	deplorable .
2	needed a new tyre over the easter period .
2	the first available date was 0rd_april ( wed ).
2	i received a call on the day to say that ( paul ) the technician '_s van had broken down on the m0 and he was running_late .
2	excellent service - courteous , professional and efficient .

2	well_done !

2	ordered mon and delivered by 00 am wednesday , even was updated by email link to track parcel .
2	reviewed loads of suppliers and this was far cheaper .

2	you get a landline_number to call and a pin code that all your callers use and in seconds you ' re all talking on a clear conference line .
2	love it .
2	we ordered some goods on the 00 th april a . m having established online that they were available .
2	we received confirmation of our order later that day and therefore expected to take delivery within their 0 - 0_days standard timeline .
2	on the 00 th we received an e_mail to day that they did not have enough stock . we cancelled .
2	i rang the firm to request confirmation of cancellation by e_mail and asked how long it would take to refund ( t and c say take 00 days ) given the fact that the firm could not process our request and we had not taken delivery of any goods .
2	i was told that someone would get back to me asap .
2	i am still_waiting .
2	have since gone with an_alternative provider which has_been excellent .
2	we ordered 0 blinds for our son '_s house ( having had similar fitted in our own from a local company at twice the price - shan '_t make that mistake again ! )
2	. first_class service and they look fantastic .
2	we shall be ordering again .

2	!
2	competitive price for an up market product .
2	professional and easy service .
2	speedy and professional online provider .
2	the item arrived promptly .
2	i get advantage 00 for my pets from pet_prescription because its good value for money .
2	they deliver promptly and i '_ve never had a problem with them .
2	i have nothing but praise for yodel delivery services .
2	their service is second to none and none of this " your parcel will be delivered between 0000 to 0000 .." you generally get an hours slot which you can change if_necessary , and you can track the delivery guy online and watch his progress to you .
2	i love it , lol !
2	!
2	couldn_'_t fault this company , i ordered a bike cover for mine and my daughters bikes and it was delivered immediately .
2	would definitely use again and recommend on .
2	product had lots of info and found viovet the cheapest for this product
2	i brought the oscillator vibration_plate and after doing a lot of reserch i went with jtx fitness and i love the machine i have had a couple before and not really happy with them but this one is very sturdy and does what it says it will and i feel i am doing a work out
2	the employees at dfw are very nice the rooms are very clean and room service comes on a daily_basis and the beds are so comfortable and it is very quiet had a pleasant stay at a great price have stayed there twice and have already booked for another weekend wouldn_'_t stay anywhere_else
2	outstandingly good service , they really went the extra_mile when i had to return one pair of sandals wrong_size , and very swiftly sent the replacement item i ordered .
2	and really nice guy on the end of the phone , wow what a change from so many companies .
2	will use them again
2	awful !
2	i booked a courier and arranged to work from home on the arranged day ( s ) so i could be in .
2	0st attempt - courier didn_'_t turn_up
2	0nd attempt - courier came but outside the time window arranged so wasn_'_t able to make the pickup
2	0rd_attempt - courier claimed to come , knock on the door and ring the doorbell .
2	however i have a coded gate at the end of my street and was in all day and recieved no calling_card
2	the communication_throughout , whilst prompt , was awful and i never recieved an_apology or an explanation .
2	just an_automated_response requesting my order number and another time / date to rearrange the courier for .
2	i requested , and got , a refund and booked with myhermes . com who were excellent and cheaper and came the day after to pick it up no problem .
2	avoid interparcel at all costs !!

2	this is a good site but not suitable for the non - technical .
2	i wanted to be able to update everything myself but still have to employ someone to do the jpegs and links .
2	the website is impossible the phone line not much_better .
2	my milk order has_been incorrect several_times and often no milk at all and then i '_ve been charged for it .
2	this means another call and somtimes i just can '_t be bothered .
2	am going to stop the service the next time they get it wrong .
2	“ i was delighted with the furniture - a bit bigger_than i '_d expected but then i '_m not good with a tape .
2	excellent value and the delivery men were a credit to your company .
2	i shall be recommending you to all my friends .”
2	this is the 0th time i have used this company and have also ordered for my mum in law great product great price great service .
2	mark delivered me my bench when he said he would and kept in touch throughout the whole time from getting the job to picking it up and bringing it to me .
2	he is a fanatstic guy and i will_definately use him again .
2	thanks mark
2	excellent product brilliant technical advice
2	i can highly_recomend this company prior to talking to them i was getting
2	highly inflated prices and little technical advice .
2	they went through the
2	whole installation proceedure with me so when the installer came to fit it i knew as much as he did and could ensure it was fitted correcty .
2	i can recomend this company to anyone who is considering underfloor_heating .
2	satuday night concert at wembley , fantastic seats , service and a night to remember for this long_awaited international tour .
2	over three hours of non_stop music with only the support of the e street band - fabuloust the boss back in london ....
2	my parcel was delivered twice whilst i was out , and it was so easy to re - arrange a delivery time to suit me .
2	the driver was very polite and the parcel delivered in tip_top condition .
2	being_able to get online and track and arrange a delivery is great !
2	they are brilliant .
2	rarely find an appliance cheaper ( only once in 0 ) customer arvo e and delivery is fantastic .
2	wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend them .
2	i always use the trainline for my travel bookings , the website is easy to use & follows smoothly from one part to the next .
2	the delivery service is great , i ordered tickets yesterday ( 00 - 0 - 0000 ) and they arrived next_day , you can '_t have better service than that can you ?
2	i was looking for some nice & pretty flowers to send to my daughter - in - law to say thaks for her thoughtfulness & found serenata , having_searched many other_sites , after a quick glance , i then went back & had a good look & liked what i saw & decided this was the site to use .
2	they notified me by text & email to give updates on delivery status .
2	will be using them again .
2	have saved the site to favourites for further use .
2	was so pleased with my order , it was exactly as i requested & arrived in about 0_days afterorder .
2	would recommend to my friends & will use again
2	thank_you for the meinl string cajun drum which arrived 0_days after ordering it !
2	the service from gear0music was first_class as is the drum therefore i would defineately use this company again and would certainly recommend gear0music to anybody_else !
2	!
2	0_months_ago we decided to buy an artisan_naturals mattress from john_ryan beds .
2	it is just fantastic , definitely the most comfortable mattress we have ever had .
2	the website is so detailed in terms of describing the layers of filling .
2	customer service was really excellent and friendly as well .
2	reviewing the product is a first for me , i don_'_t usually bother , but mattresses are such an important purchase .
2	the product was of a siperb quality , and the transaction was quick and efficient , you just couldn_'_t ask for anything_else /
2	good service , quick and trustworthy , and some excellent products at competitive_prices
2	this is a very good shopping site .
2	i cannot_believe_how quickly the products are delivered - and they are well_packaged .
2	i would recommend holisiticshop . co . uk to anyone .
2	i sent envirofone my well cared for ipad0 when i could no_longer get the battery to take any charge .
2	i expected them to cut the price , but no : they gave_me the full price for a working device .
2	i assume this means a new battery is standard when they refurbish , but other_companies quoted lower prices for a working device and would not have looked at my non - charger at all .
2	would certainly use again .
2	this was only my second order , but it was delivered on time wrapped well , no_problems .
2	thank_you .
2	what can i say the delivery was quick the item arrived in perfect_condition , i was delighted with what i ordered so would highly_recommend this company and would certainly buy from them again , oh and the best prices by far .
2	i ordered neil young tickets as a gift .
2	the tickets arrived within 0_days and they were good seats too .

2	!
2	i too placed an order in october and was given week 00 to expect delivery , unlike previous reviewers infurn have not been in touch with me , or answered any emails .

2	i have used apharooms twice once last_year in marrakech and this year in spain .
2	i am disabled and require disabled access shower facilities .
2	i
2	i had booked hotels where alpharooms stated the hotels as having rooms with facilities for the disabled .
2	in marrakech the hotel kenzi farah did not have rooms with bathroom facilities for the disabled .
2	in spain the hotel sorra daurada gave_us a room with no disabled facilities but they changed us to a room with a shower only when i compl
2	ained .
2	why have a part on the booking form for requests when there is no chance of getting what you request .
2	also i would like to say that in my opinion alpharoom clients are given the inferior accomodation that hotels would not offer to guests paying the full price .
2	always use gjw_titmuss for ordering our dog_food , never been a problem on line swift easy to use .
2	efficient delivery .
2	this evening , tried and tried , after 00_minutes have given up - very disappointed customer ( maybe soon to be ex - customer )

2	bought wowcher deal , money came out twice and didnt receive voucher , although i contacted them before deal expired by the time it was established my card payment was authourised the deal was finished so here i am , no voucher for uk break and £_000 out of my credit_card .
2	this was the first dealings i had with the company and will_definately be my last .
2	very unapologetic e_- mail saying that the money would be refunded !
2	very good company will gladly do_buisness with them again , and tell other people how good they are .
2	terrible service .
2	they simply didn_'_t deliver the flowers and blamed their courier .
2	i wish i had read the reviews before using them .
2	excellent service , fast delivery and easy checkout_process .
2	. argos is a great place to buy anything . i have shopped for many things at argos as they have a great range of products at great prices . its so easy to shop there i always check to see if the item i want is in stock then just reserve it then pick it up . its hassle_free , quick and i would highly_recommend argos if you want high_quality goods but at a price you can_afford
2	mazuma is a great place to recycle your old phone . i wanted my old phone to have a good home as it was in excellent condition and not very old . i looked up lots of companys and found mazuma to be the best . they told me how much my phone was worth straight_away and how to send it to them . it was so quick and easy . once they had received my old phone i received my payment , this was also very quick . i would highly_recommend mazuma to everyone who_wants to sell there old phone . they are trustworthy , very efficient and i would always use mazuma in the future .
2	simple , friendly , and they got me a good deal - would certainly recommend age_partnership 000000
2	if you want to transfer money easily then use currencies_direct .
2	these were a birthday_gift for our daughter in england so i haven_'_t actually seen them as we live in france but she said they were the best flowers we have ever sent her .
2	i had previously used another well know supplier .
2	they offer a good range of sewing_machines from basic to advanced .
2	there is a simple ordering system .
2	most wonderful of all , delivery is next working day and both smd and the couriers let you know when to expect delivery .
2	absolutely wonderful .
2	serenata do great flowers in great arrangements .
2	they use another company to deliver .
2	my last two orders were delivered late , the second one being for my mother on mother '_s day .
2	customer_services were again less_than helpful .
2	they snootily pointed_out that the small_print says they can '_t guarantee delivery on the specified day .
2	what '_s the point of sending special_occasion flowers if there '_s a 00 / 00 chance they won_'_t arrive .
2	what '_s the point of using serenata ?
2	none at all .
2	i was worried_about my doggie , he_loves bones and does have them altho i have noticed he gets constipation afterwards , this last_week we noticed him really struggling and was shocked at the time he took with no result and was trembling .
2	i gave him a wam bath and a small_amount of poo esaped . i bought liquid paraffin from viovet and gave the reccomended dose and hey_presto a happy dog and owner . thanks for the product easily given , a price i could_afford and the advice
2	i have bought this shampoo for my dog who is nervous of bath time , but he gets smelly as is always out side routtling about in the grass and leaves . no more water fights , he is calm and happy with regular small areas treated , thank_you for a brill product xxxxx
2	was reccommended by my daughter to use your company , very pleased with ease of ordering and speed of delivery and condition of the packaging was excellent , thanks
2	i googled to consider who to offer my mobile phone to and mazuma came up as the preferred option .
2	i had only used them once before but on both_occasions they have been easy to deal with and sent the payment to me very quickly .
2	i would always recommend them .
2	excellent service and value for money
2	would be very happy to deal with ziffit again as process beginning to end was simple , efficient and quick .
2	exactly_what i wanted , delivered free , and a competitive price .
2	nothing else to add except well_done
2	the shed from tiger_sheds was delivered exactly as promised at the beginning of the two hour .
2	the driver helped unload the shed and carried in to the bottom of a very long garden for me in the rain . he was not required to do this but volunteered to do so .
2	excellent service .
2	happy to recommend tiger_sheds to anyone .
2	excellent service , and delivery .
2	best game have ever played ..... whens number two out !!!
2	!
2	thought it would take at_least 0_weeks but 0_days amazing
2	with its easy to navigate website , variety of products , low_prices and speedy delivery why shop anywhere_else .
2	website was easy to follow , there is a wide_choice of products , offered quality goods with a speedy delivery .
2	would recommend this company .

2	never had a real issue of any sort .
2	customer service is good and delivery speed is excellent .
2	i found everything very easy to do , website easy and simple and i liked the idea of having one person allocated to contact if i had any trouble , which i didn_'_t as everything was so simple .
2	delivery was very quick and the plant was in good condition and very healhy .
2	the overall service was brilliant and i would have no quams of using them again .

2	i have to have my german_shepherd on long_term repeat_prescription .
2	vio_vet are half the price of the vets .

2	i wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else .
2	helen hill lancashire .
2	i found my highlander costume on line .
2	a lot had the same in stock but i went to mega_fancy_dress for the price at first .
2	i saw that even_though it was cheaper_than_anywhere_else they were not trying to rip me off with the postage .
2	it was what it would cost anyone for first_class package .
2	i needed the outfit in a hurry and it came the next_day .
2	friendly excellent service .
2	well_done .!!!
2	i will be back next time i need an outfit .
2	thank_you !

2	i had been looking at these particular approach shoes for some time but thought they were quite_pricey at £_000 .
2	however found them in taunton_leisure for a very competitive price and with free delivery .
2	they arrived within 00_hours of ordering and were just what i wanted .
2	absolutely_thrilled with them .
2	great service and a great price .
2	i would recommend the shop to anyone_wanting good pricing and excellent service .
2	very good prices and very efficient delivery .
2	i would definately recommend this comany .
2	theres no beginning to their talents - just years of endless errors - even sold my data - was fine when it was abbey - have now moved to another bank - poorly_trained_staff , even they themselves finally admitted they had expanded too quickly have messed_up big time - and its in every possible ... they even get a rare red_flag - avoid !
2	warning in which magazine - at_least its their corporate colour ...
2	bought lava lamp - told at till v clearly - its ok to try it at home and no_probs to get a refund if i didnt like it - took it back 0_days_later after plugging it in just once - v rudely refused refund because " tried it " [ which_meant i had " used it " ] - omg !!!
2	!
2	wonderful on initial sign up of contract very helpful .
2	absolutely_shocking service thereafter !
2	regularly cut_off mid sentence after a massive amount of waiting time to speak to an operator who usually passes you through to several other depts so make_sure you '_ve got lots of free time to speak to anyone at talk_talk !
2	don_'_t expect to speak to a manager or anyone in authority it won_'_t happen !
2	definitely don_'_t forget to pay your bill on time or they will cut your service off for a full 00hrs after you '_ve paid it !
2	english_speaking operators would be nice as its very hard to understand what '_s being said !
2	i was with talk_talk for over 0yrs for broadband / homeline / mobile and never notified i was clearly on the wrong plan for usage consequently paying over the odds !
2	have switched provider altogether and much happier with my wonderful services and plan .
2	i can always find what i need at supplement_warehouse ... and the prices are great !
2	i phoned not really knowing what i actually wanted and explained what i was trying to achieve .
2	the lovely man on the other end of the phone couldn_'_t have been more helpful , explaining the different_types of vinyl , their uses and even the finishes .
2	he even offered help over the phone if i had any_problems with using or applying the vinyl .
2	i placed an order in the afternoon and the parcel arrived by 0am the following_morning .. talk about speed !
2	i will definitely be calling on them again for more supplies .
2	it took less time to get a quote and place an order than phoning my usual_supplier directly .
2	the oil was delivered within a couple of days .
2	i spent some time researching the best price for a camcorder and simplyelectronics were the cheapest i found .

2	you must go on pet_supermarket site and buy a furminator for your dog it gets all the old fur that is underneath the coat and lets the dogs skin breathe it is fantastic and i would recommend it to everybody it is really worth the money .
2	pet_supermarket was the cheapest site .
2	go on the site now and see for yourself , you and your dog wont_be disappointed .
2	i would recommend this site to you they are fantastic , fabulous and so helpful , prices are good , they are always there when i need them or when i need something . they dont nag you to keep buying .
2	so i have happy pets .
2	my order was placed on a monday - the website was easy to use and checkout was simple .
2	i had good delivery options and as i wanted my products quickly i chose next_day delivery .
2	midday the next_day i had received my goods and been given clear messages of the hourly_slot the parcel would arrive .
2	great service .
2	i ordered flowers for my mothers_00th_birthday in australia .
2	the picture looked lovely and i scaled up an extra £_00 for extra flowers rounding up to an arrangement for £_00 . 00 which included £ 0 . 00 delivery in australia .
2	the flowers my mother received were definitely not worth the money i paid so i complained to iflorist who opened a ticket and advised they would check with the australian end for an explanation .
2	a couple of weeks went by with no word back from iflorist so having got the phone number of the australian florist , i called them directly to find out their side of the story .
2	they advised me they had not heard a word from iflorist and that the order they received was for $_00 aud which at the time and exchange_rate would have been £_00 ... meaning iflorist kept £_00 for themselves ... yes .. as good as half the amount i paid .
2	i think this is disgusting and dishonest !!
2	the australian florist advised out of the $_00 they received , they had to take out $_00 delivery , $ 0 for packaging , paper , ribbon etc and the 0 roses in the arrangement were $ 0 each plus a few carnations , 0 gerbras and a bit of greenery .
2	the australian end are not at fault .
2	it is greedy iflorist .
2	they need to be exposed so that other consumers do not fall victim .
2	i have sent iflorist a further 0 emails and tried_phoning but have had no response on any front .
2	i am totally disappointed and will also report them to trading_standards as i feel its highway robbery !!
2	buyers_beware !
2	!
2	excellent .
2	easy to use web_site and was delivered the next_day .
2	i '_ll go straight to the point .
2	tesco is phenomenally dreadful when it comes to displaying goods on offer .
2	the amount of times i '_ve had to go back to customer_services to return or exhange items because the notices are not displayed with the appropriate products .
2	is this a strategy to catch out customers who do not check their receipts ?
2	don_'_t expect customers to read little labels to determine whether a product is on a particular offer or not .
2	shelves should be stocked appropriately and should not be mixed up with different offers .
2	this is one reason_why sometimes i go off shopping at tesco for a long time .
2	i never seem to have that problem in asda or sainsbury '_s .
2	why can '_t tesco be a bit more organized .
2	not very helpful indeed when the shop is busy .
2	and don_'_t blame customers for putting other items on the shelves - perhaps they give up because they could not understand what is actually on an offer !
2	and by the way , sometimes these offers are not really good deals - so it is quite misleading !
2	purchased a yoga retreat back in october , booked to go in march .
2	turned_up at the venue to find it locked up and closed .
2	contacted groupon to be informed that the company had gone_bust the day before , mass email sent to all purchasers ( still to be received ) and telephone_call made to me ( an_absolute lie as no record of call being received or missed ).
2	in fairness i did get the money credited back to my card however my friend and i wasted a day travelling to and from the venue ( so loss of earnings and petrol money ) and needed to find another activity to use with our holiday days .
2	groupon could not help with this either so we had to find an_alternative which cost us lots more than our original trip .
2	trying to get a response from customer service was impossible without having to shame them into it on facebook .
2	would appear that if you post on their facebook_page you get shunted up the list of customers that need responding to .
2	saying that , i sent a response to their e_- mail on 0 march and still not heard back .
2	really can '_t see that i would buy from groupon again .
2	i did buy something from wowcher recently and their customer service was excellent .
2	problem_solved within 00_minutes of me raising it .
2	groupon could do well to learn lessons from wowcher .
2	the process was fairly straightforward if a little longwinded .
2	you get e_mails saying your goods have arrived , then they ` re being checked ( and if any are not acceptable - they don_`_t return them or let you know , you have to check yourself !).
2	the prices they pay are not mega but if you want to get_rid of stuff and actually earn some money for it then it `_s ok .
2	i have nothing but praise for temptation_gifts .
2	everything i ` ve ordered has arrived in good time , been really well_packaged and been fabulous value for money .
2	if you are thinking of ordering from them , don_`_t_hesitate , you won_`_t regret it !
2	i ` ve now ordered a few items from salon skincare .
2	the prices are always very competitive and they have a great range of products .
2	everything i have ever ordered has arrived in perfect order and in good time .
2	i would recommend salon skincare to anyone !
2	would definately recomend , easy returns if_necessary .
2	ordered a computer game on 0 - 0_days delivery mid_afternoon and it arrived next_day am .
2	for free delivery charge that is excellent .
2	a few other_companies should take_note .
2	i will_definately use simplygames in the future .
2	another plus was they were the cheapest by far .
2	ordered wool on saturday_afternoon , no postage charge and it arrived at 0 : 00 this morning .
2	no_hassle , convenient_location , my car passed the mot test and at half price , what more could you ask for .
2	excellent .
2	to save phoning around for prices you get them here all in the one place .
2	you van also pick your_own tyres amd compare different tyres and different brands amd quality .
2	you book your appointment for fitting from the . branch nearest to . you , and pay . for it all online . couldn_'_t be anymore comvenient
2	although was purchase was through an insurance claim , i will purchase products from hobs in the future .
2	used resort_hoppa in gran_canaria .

2	had emailed for more information and received prompt and courteous reply .
2	i bought the sureflap cat_flap from pet_supermarket , and it is an excellent product , cheaper from pet_supermarket than_anywhere_else .
2	plus prompt , free delivery .
2	arrived promptly , product fine .
2	well , not exactly , but they were extremely efficient , had a very wide_choice and competitively_priced .
2	i used the livechat service as i was unsure_about whether you could specify a time_slot for collection of a parcel on the service i had booked .
2	the lady i spoke to - i think it was rose - arranged an_alternative date , saving me the hassle of redoing my whole order .
2	very efficient and on the ball , which was much_appreciated .
2	laminator arrived within less_than 00_hours from ordering
2	absolutely_delighted with the very prompt delivery and very good quality of the 0 blackout_roller_blinds i bought .
2	all i can say is 0_star products , and 0_star service .
2	i really could not be_happier with the products and service i have received from higher_nature over the years , have been a member for quite a number of years , very quick delivery and the varying things i buy especially the antioxidants i feel definately improve the quality of my life , i am 00 years old and quite active , and will_continue to buy from higher_nature as long as i am able , many_thanks

2	the products were significantly_cheaper_than elsewhere and arrived quickly .
2	would recommend .
2	exante have recently expanded their product range and there should now be plenty of choice for anyone who struggled with the original 0 flavours of shake & soups .
2	i '_ve tried all of the new_additions and they ' re not at all bad - but my preference is to stick to the soups , shakes and bars - all of which i find very tasty .
2	a first_class product from a very responsive company - every time i '_ve ordered from exante the goods turn_up next working day - and i '_ve never had a mistake made in preparing my order .
2	wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend .

2	not at all !
2	everything is explained_clearly and when i received my glasses i was absolutely_delighted .

2	after message from asda this morning stating item despatched with tracking_link to hermes .
2	after_reading_reviews , nearly all 0star my heart_sank .
2	however , speak as i find , 0 and a half hours_later i opened the door to pleasant driver with my order .
2	only ordered on monday with eta of 00th_jan to feb 0rd .
2	my sympathies go out to you who have had dreadful problems but i can '_t find fault .
2	fed_up with lids and bins blown about the area in latest storms .
2	decided to get bin that was heavier , smart with attached lid .
2	wow !
2	did this do the job .
2	well impressed on all counts .
2	much_cheaper_than local_pet shop but still original products for marine 000 .
2	more than pleased with items delivered super_fast .
2	easy to navigate site , and the wheelchair blue velcro strap so comfy better_than just the one strap and its more secure thankyou
2	we had never used trust_pilot before ; however , needed to find someone_who could take some large items out to france for us .
2	we had a few quotes , and chose one that seemed to suit our requirements and budget which proved a good move .
2	we would not_hesitate in using trust_pilot again .
2	from the first consultation to the end results , i simply cannot recommend botonics highly_enough .
2	i have been using them for some years_now for fillers and botox , i have used other_companies in the past but once i was lucky_enough to find botonics i have never looked back .
2	i have several friends i have introduced to botonics and they are as equally happy with the service and results as i am
2	i recieved some flowers today , from my daughter in canada they were not suppose to be sent until the 0th but came today on the 0th for mothers_day , i dread to think what they would be like then , i feel for my daughter who has paid to have these delivered to me for mothers_day , you could buy a better bunch at supermarket i am discusted to think they could send such a bunch and charge my daughter a lot of money .
2	and have no phone number to contact them , please do not waste your money ordering from this firm until they can prove who they really are

2	a right hand one delivered instead !
2	delivery was extremely prompt !

2	ordered tickets in februaruy to see pink in hannover on the 0th_may .
2	received an_email in german on friday 00th_april and couldn_'_t get to speak to anyone untill the monday when i was told that this email was telling_me that the seller couldn_'_t supply the tickets and that they were offering me tickets for the o0 - she asked me if this was acceptable at which point i made her aware that the o0 concerts had indeed already happened !
2	i was then assured that they would try to get me replacement tickets for hannover , apologised for the email being sent in germand and assured me it would be resent in english and took my mobile number so that they could contact me as soon as they found replacement tickets to change delivery to the hotel in hannover as they would not get to the uk in time .
2	come the end of wednesday 0nd may , i realised that these tickets were not happening and so i cancelled our travel from aberdeen , uk ( myself , my husband and our 00 year_old_son ).
2	then what happened - i got an_email on the thursday to say my tickets had been dispatched !
2	no call , no way to change delivery and all travel and hotel already cancelled .
2	on top of this , the tickets arrived - i had paid eu000 each and the face value was eu00 . 00 - double the price - disgusting !
2	and of course , we all lost out completely so i am eu000 out of pocket ( including viagogo '_s admin_fee ).
2	i would never use viagogo again
2	and you will note that 0_weeks on , they haven_'_t responded to explain themselves !
2	it '_s now 00th_may and i posted this on the 0th .
2	ref_:_0000000
2	great quality food , dogs love it and thrive on it .
2	exceptionally friendly , knowledgeable and helpful on the phone .
2	order before the cut_off time and the food arrives next_day by timed delivery .
2	they really have got it all right , brilliant company .
2	have placed loads of orders with them for all_sorts of things for my 0 dogs .
2	never had a problem , if an item was out of stock they emailed me to tell me and let_me know when the goods were expected back in stock .
2	fast reliable service with good prices .
2	thank_you vetuk !
2	ordered with next_day delivery but a week on not arrived .
2	no reply to email so rang them .
2	some items out of stock so the whole order delayed !
2	and it '_s not their policy to let you know - how helpful eh !
2	disgusted , will be going back to my regular reliable internet supplier whose prices are the same or cheaper .
2	ordered over new year and as the web_site stated they were closed over the hols i didn_'_t expect delivery for a few_days and it came today ( thurs ) which i was more than happy with .
2	the dog_food was the cheapest i '_ve seen it for ages .
2	good range of things too .
2	one very happy customer , thanks .
2	good website , easy to find what you want , quick checkout .
2	item arrived quickly , would recommend them .
2	hoover were responsible for delivery but failed to make contact when they found they could not deliver .
2	whitebox were very good and very prompt in sorting it all out and getting it delivered at the earliest_opportunity
2	velux replacement part needed - quote by velux was over_£_00 dearer_than roofing_superstore

2	i have now placed 0 orders with viovet - they were not only the cheapest for the products purchased but their despatch service was excellent both_times .
2	the last order was made online very late on a wednesday_night and was received on the friday little more than 00hrs_later - and was postage free
2	ok this is what i think .
2	real easy to book .
2	great price and do what the say .
2	pick_up and deliver on time .
2	could ask for more .
2	have used them 0 times so far .
2	the hardest_part is setting_up your_own personalised account after that - provided you can remember the password - it is child '_s play to tranfer money to places near and far .
2	oh and you can do it at any time - day or night .
2	my favourite on - line store and with amazon_prime i don_'_t worry_about postage for most things
2	sometimes living in a rural backwater as i do it is difficult to find the products i want without travelling far and wide .
2	i have used chemist_direct a couple of times_now and am delighted with the speed of service .
2	straightforward web_site , easy to use and great rates
2	i could not believe that they did what they said which was deliver next working day .
2	its not that i didn_'_t_believe the blurb but we live in the sticks in northern_ireland so i thought it would be ( as usual ) at_least 0_days before the parcel would arrive .
2	well_packaged .
2	we have been using mdp for over 0 years_now .
2	we usually get great service and their prices are always really good .

2	overall we are very happy with all_aspects of the business .
2	fast shipping , great prices and good quality all_round .
2	i have never had a problem with delivery or quality of items .
2	sometimes the sizing on the clothing is on the small side but i usually buy a size up in clothing from my normal and this is fine .
2	shoe sizing is always correct .
2	great quality always not cheap rubbish .
2	i buy lots of boots , shoes and dresses and have never had a problem .
2	we were very lucky to stay at rocket 0 in newquay , cornwall .

2	the holiday from the booking process through to the end of our stay was fab and it always helps when you have a great rep . so all in all i would highly_recommend to all
2	i bought several posters for my daughter '_s bedroom .
2	i thought the selection was brilliant and had a difficult time picking only a few posters .
2	the emails to let_me know my posters were on their way were appreciated , as was the quick delivery .
2	best of all were the posters themselves .
2	they were bright , clear and great quality , all for a really good price .
2	i '_m off to choose more now !

2	i searched the internet and read some of the reviews and thought they are a good company to go with to sell my ipad they quoted me a good price , then i sent it via_royal_mail special delivery costing_£_00 i then received an_email_saying it had been requoted when i checked it was for half the amount of the original_quote !!
2	when i emailed them to question why they said there were scratches to screen and casing !!
2	i know for sure that is lies because it has_been in a leather case since the day i bought it .
2	i told them to return it then they said it would be returned in over two_weeks !!!
2	why ??
2	i sent numerous_emails and tried_ringing but to no_avail this went on for a few_days eventually i got an answer from someone i told them i wanted my ipad back immediately he tried to say it wouldn_'_t be returned yet but i kicked off told him it was my property and wanted it back he then turned around and said i would have it back by two_days time ..
2	i got it the next_day .
2	it was missing the lead to charge it too so i rang about that and they said i couldn_'_t get my lead back but he would send a standard one mine was an extra long pink lead !!!
2	all in all it was a bad_experience they are scammers , liars and thieves !!!
2	do not use them !
2	!
2	i got a quote from mazuma for my old phone in the afternoon , the postage bag arrived the next_morning , and i sent it back that day .

2	i have used e_- tyres for about 0 years they have always been the cheapest and the most convenient as i work all week , they come to my work i hand over the keys they let_me know when they have finished and they ask me to check the tyres before they leave , i received 0 quotes for my winter_tyres and incl fitting e_- tyres was the cheapest , i was dubious_about buying winter_tyres before and in 0000 took the plunge they were great i live in a small_village and getting out was always a problem in bad_weather , i will not_hesitate to buy these when my current winters wear out i expect them to last me about 0 years .
2	very easy to order and full order arrived next_day !
2	excellent sevice !
2	hiya lily ,
2	thanks for all your hard_work yesterday , it was really good of you to keep me so well informed , i didn_'_t feel lonely allllll day !!!!
2	the flowers arrived just after half past four .
2	please tell the driver , though that some people they deliver to , might be elderly or disabled and just need a few more seconds to get to the door , so they don_'_t have to struggle to get the flowers up from the porch floor , plus a smiley_face offering a lovely surprise is as special as the flowers !
2	( but it was all fine , really ).
2	thanks , lily for the voucher too , it made it more of a possibility for me to send the lovely roses to mrs_p . they reminded her of her father .. he loved red_roses !
2	anyways , lily i have to go and make some cakes ... pop in , if you are ever passing , for a cuppa and cupcake !
2	love to all the bloom masters ...

2	i have never had such good service from an online company and will use them in the furure .
2	many_thanks
2	trust_pilot has requested me to authenticate my review of house trip 0 times .
2	each time i have furnished proof of purchase to trust_pilot and each time it has ignored the evidence i have supplied .
2	trust_pilot is clearly not an_independent organisation and appears to be paid to only accept positive_reviews of house trip .
2	our review of house trip was not positive and it appears that trust_pilot does not want to publish our review because it is negative
2	helpful advisor great service

2	want to thank deramores for their very prompt delivery of my order for wool .
2	came within less_than 00_hours .
2	i used to knit many_years_ago and was unsure if i '_d get back into it again especially with there being so few shops to purchase wool and buy patterns from .
2	the shops that are about don_'_t stock as bigger range as deramores so its been such a pleasure having their website to order from .
2	so miuch choice and keen prices , with alot of special_offers too .
2	i did worry that knitting had become old_fashioned but deramores certainly has some more up to date patterns to chose from

2	also the helpline staff and experts are great .
2	i can_trust them all to give me sound_advice .
2	the operatives are always so friendly and cheerfull .
2	its like having a friend at the end of the line .
2	i found direct sight online , after my eye_test at specsavers , where i have been a customer for over 00 years .
2	i needed a new perscription , and having purchased 0 pairs of frames a year_ago from them , i asked to have them reglased .
2	i was shocked to be told that they would be the same pice as new frames and lenses .
2	now i am on my pension so have a limited_budget .
2	besides , i like the frames i have , and paid £_000 for all three_sets - day - night distance for driving and sunglasses .
2	this was made possible due to at the time a little windfall i had .
2	so i went online and found you .
2	thought well here go '_s for £_00 a pair .
2	i spoke to one of your customer advisors , a very pleasant and helpful girl .
2	she advised me to try the silver package .
2	i recieved my frames back 0_days_later and i am delighted with them .
2	so next month - pension day - i will be sending another pair to you .
2	i went back to specsaver '_s and filled in their survey saying why i chose you .
2	i am now recomending you to friends and family .
2	regards , susan p . dodds .
2	ordered flowers 0_weeks in_advance for my mother '_s birthday .
2	not delivered on the day - i was not told there was a problem .
2	looking further the flowers went to the courier the day before due delivery date and have no been transported around various couriers depots for the last three_days !!!
2	!
2	i have tried contacting the prestige and delivery company ( yodel ), whilst to be fair i have had a reply ( albeit slow ) all they say is sorry , should be there soon .
2	this is totally_unacceptable , has ruined my mum '_s birthday and i have had to order new flowers from elsewhere , as even if these ever turn_up they will be dead !
2	flowers finally arrived 0_days_later , the roses were totally dead and the rest of the bunch had seen much_better days - my mum was so upset .
2	i sent another email to the company who still refuse to give refund , only offering another bunch of flowers .
2	why would we want another delayed and dead bunch of flowers ?
2	never mind the fact i have already had to purchase another bunch from elsewhere .
2	to top it all prestige lodged a claim on trust_pilot that my review was not accurate !
2	a few emails soon sorted that - thanks trust_pilot !
2	prestige have also stopped me posting on their face book page - i put nothing other than the truth , in a reasonable way !
2	this company are relying_on the perishable goods_act to get out of refunds and need to be stopped !
2	clothes great and competions good also
2	reasonable_prices
2	always ready with an answer
2	great service , been with them for years and never any_problems
2	only_downside of primark if you want to take anything back you go to customer_services with two people on , queue for ages as everyone takes one item back and pays for two basket fulls while they are there , i recommend that the refunds counter is for refunds only ... as i wasted all my lunch hour queing to just get a refund very frustrated , or even more people on to deal with just refunds .........
2	great company friendly advisors and always helpful
2	always had easy transactions with argos online
2	always available for any_issues i have
2	first time used this company but would definately do so again and also recommend to my friends .
2	a big thank_you , your blinds arrived within less_than 00_hours and are perfect .

2	extremely quick service , prices very good
2	bought a bed from one of the companies they '_ve got on their website , comfy_living .
2	it broke within 0_weeks - complained through amazon , which took me a few_days how to work it all out as so complicated and got the response from the company after they took 0_days to reply - that as i '_d had bed for 00 days i wasn_'_t entitled to a refund !
2	am still battling with this rotten company - do not buy anything from comfy_living - who are a disgrace .
2	amazon say they can '_t help , even_though when i put a claim in i had a phone_call from them stating that they were going to refund me ?!
2	i will never buy through them again .
2	this company are the worst ever - do not go with them .
2	i had non_stop problems with their internet which their staff are unable to sort_out - they are frequently very rude and / or cannot_speak_english properly , so you have a lot of trouble trying to understand what they are saying .
2	when we tried to leave they wouldn_'_t transfer our account to the new company we chose .
2	in the end i got so fed_up with receiving umpteen calls from their staff asking if i '_d like to renew my contract , that i cancelled my direct_debit in the hope that this would tell them that i was leaving - they cancelled our phone line the next_day and left us with no line , not to even call emergency services - which i thought was illegal .
2	it took us 0_months to get our phone line reconnected due to the way in which talktalk had cut us off - as if we hadn_'_t paid , which we had - we were up to date with payments .
2	they continued to charge us for the next 0_months also !
2	this only got refunded when i took my complaint to ofcom - but talktalk sent them copies of letters they '_d " sent " me - they hadn_'_t ?!
2	so i '_m still trying to get compensation for everything they did wrong to me & for costs_incurred as a result of being suddenly cut_off without_any warning !
2	do not go with this company ever
2	yodel let amazon down .
2	please get_rid of them
2	rubbish - every time i see yodel are delivering i cringe
2	i returned something and left new batteries in because it was faulty you sent new pack of batts with my replacement item . not many places would do that , also quick service .
2	thank_you
2	i was initially very wary of buying online .
2	what ??
2	not seeing / trying out a bed first ??
2	however , at john_ryan there was so much useful_information , much of which was new to me ( and i '_m an_oap so i '_ve been around a while !).
2	they were also very helpful in promptly answering all my questions and giving me advice .
2	the delivery men kept me informed about their arrival , and were very efficient when they arrived .
2	go_ahead - you won_'_t regret it .
2	paperstone '_s prices are very competitive , and i could hardly_believe_how quickly my order came .
2	well_done , and i hope to do_business with you again .
2	ordered my item on monday - delivery stated 0 - 0_days .

2	i ordered a wreath for my aunties funeral it was meant to be bright vibrant_colours of pink , purple and lime_green but when they sent it the wreath was yellow and nothing like the colour or description or one i had purchased ( see photos ).
2	i complained to them online as they conveniently have no telephone_number available to contact them with .
2	they at first ignored my complaint and after several e_-_mails and me stating that if they didn_'_t reply i was informing trading_standards they sent a very short terse e_- mail informing_me as far as they were concerned there was nothing wrong with my order but if i e_- mailed them the details ( which i already had done then ) they would look into it , so i sent the details again which they didn_'_t reply to so i have now have reported them to trading_standards and i have written to iflorist as instructed by trading_standards stating my complaint and asking for a full_refund but i am still_waiting for a reply but i don_'_t hold out much hope as they seem to have little in the way of customer service skills and their communication with customers is very unsatisfactory and not consumer friendly at all .
2	it almost seems like they hope if they ignore customers or make it difficult to contact them that anyone who complains will give up and put it down to experience , but i am not willing to do this on principle so i will keep contacting them until i get a satisfactory reply .
2	i could not believe_how quick and efficient ao was .
2	i will definitely use again !
2	great for regular shopping , and pretty good for the variety of offers , always clean and friendly .
2	i would definitely use this service again !
2	fantastic product exactly_what i ordered , and brilliant ordering and delivery , i can '_t_believe i only had 00_hours between ordering and receiving my product .
2	and a time_slot - unheard of and delivered in that time - wow !!
2	will definitely order from you again and recommend you to friends .
2	thank_you so much .
2	every time i order a product from lintbells i never have any hassle .
2	they pack the goods very well and the package always arrive the following_day .
2	thank_you lintbells for being a great company and having products that my dog enjoys .
2	as usual , fast and efficient service
2	every order i have placed with viovet has arrived superfast and well_packed .
2	very impressive .
2	i discovered little_adventure shop because a friend recommended some kids shoes to me .
2	not only were the shoes half price , delivery was reasonable and came fast .
2	seamless order process from_start to finish , will definitely be using them again and can highly_recommend .
2	this was my first time ordering a vetenery prescription online and i was very impressed .
2	within 00_hours of ordering online and posting the prescription , the order had arrived .
2	they communicated_throughout the order process , hassle_free and cheaper_than the vet .
2	can '_t recommend them highly_enough and will_continue to use pet_prescription .
2	ordered at lunch_time and my parcel arrived the next_day .
2	brilliant !
2	will definitely be using them again .
2	so much_easier than going to the shops , a great help if you are unwell .
2	my two sisters came to visit from the united_states and their_faces were radiant .
2	their skin healthy , alive , glowing .
2	they '_d been using clarisonic cleansers for a few_weeks .
2	i thought about getting one but have rosacea and hesitated .
2	then i found current_body online .
2	they sell the clarisonic range and even_though their website gives very thorough and good information , i had some particular questions .
2	so i telephoned current_body .
2	current_body just couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
2	i was given clear answers , some gentle suggestions and felt entirely comfortable ordering a classic clarisonic from current_body .
2	there is a wonderful 00 - day trial period .
2	within 0_days of placing the order , the clarisonic cleanser came by post .
2	it took only a week for me to realise it is a superb cleanser .
2	my daughters noticed the difference in my skin and wanted to try out clarisonic cleanser .
2	i did not_hesitate one second to go back to current_body and buy two more over the phone .
2	fast .
2	efficient .
2	effective .
2	thank_you , current_body !
2	really great service , harvey our consultant was excellent i must have driven him mad with all of my questions .
2	it was a large party booking with all of the issues that entails but everything we asked for was attended to and our travel_arrangements went without a hitch ( i hate flying ) but all went_smoothly .
2	jmf .
2	good range of products quickly despatched and well_wrapped would use again
2	after having problems with the website , i contacted customer_services and caroline was really helpful .
2	even when i made a mistake and had to contact her again , she sorted it out .
2	very good service :_d
2	reference_number 000000
2	i can not praise the company and james enough the service was first_class .
2	they took ownership of my enquiry and kept me fully_informed at ever step of the way , they made the whole_process straight_forward .
2	they were so polite , sincere and helpful .
2	will highly_recommend them to everyone i know .
2	kindest_regards

2	i looked for a 0000 , large load washing_machine on line .
2	found an lg to be what we needed , and then found beyond_television to be by far the best price .
2	site offered free delivery on a monday , which suited me .
2	booked it , recevied confirmation order , then text a few_days before giving me an expected delivery time , and a call from the driver on the day to say when he was within 00_minutes of arriving .
2	washing_machine was delivered , packaging removed so i could check it was ok , and its been working brillantly since .
2	excellent customer service and value for money .
2	i would have no_hesitation in buying again from beyond_television .
2	i recently bough new taylormade irons , putter and a bag and the total was well below other similar retailers .
2	plus , its not far from where i live so i could go and look at the equipment before buying .
2	quality goods at low_prices
2	on arrival no_problems at all , well_organised with directions to coach and was in our hotel within a hour of landing .
2	return_journey was the same , right on time in lovely coach with friendly driver .
2	once again travel_republic is the best holiday site to book with .
2	no_problems , always the best priced holidays and any advice you need they are a friendly helpful voice on the end of the phone .
2	ordered for my fathers christmas_present what a lovely delicate item - my husband and son thought it was lovely too
2	the process is quick , simple and you can see the result of what you ' re designing as you do it .
2	we '_ve_used them twice with great success and will definitely be using them again .
2	postage is pretty quick too considering they ' re in sweden .
2	from_start to finish duel were a nightmare .
2	they underestimated the length of the job by 0_days ( a 0 day job in total ) because they ( in their own words ) " underestimated how long the paint would take to dry ".
2	in addition , they left my house unlocked , doors open and insecure twice .
2	guaranteed my spare_room would be ready for overseas visitors - i came home from work that night to find it looking like a bomb had exploded .
2	i paid £_000 to put my visitors in hotel for the weekend - not even an_apology from duel .
2	i wouldn_'_t wish the stress and incompetence ( let_alone shoddy workmanship ) on my worst_enemy
2	i had avoided reselling previous phones as thought it would be a hassle .
2	it '_s not .
2	i can '_t_believe_how easy envirofone make it .
2	they also paid me 00_% more than vodafone offered me .
2	i can '_t recommend highly_enough .
2	really pleased with the item i received from you ,( it was a costume for halloween ) it was how described on the item , and was delivered within the time specified .. size wise it was generous , but comfortable ..... just wish you were able to get the christmas cracker for adults in size l or xl , but will keep trying your site as theres still a good few_weeks till its needed ... thanx , and i look_forward to doing_business with you again .. yours lollepop x
2	good communication via_e_mail .
2	quick_turnaround from receipt of my tapes to returning completed dvd transfers .
2	good quality of transfer .
2	will use again .
2	easy to sell , and they are quick to pay .
2	couldnt be easier .
2	when we arrived in tenerife airport the driver was waiting with a sign showing my name and the car was just outside the terminal .
2	on our return trip the driver arrived a little early so was ready when we arrived at the receiption desk .
2	we will use suntransfers again .
2	wonderful prompt service - will definitely use again .
2	traveled to malaga , jose who picked us up for our return_journey was extremely_helpful and made us feel very comfortable .

2	excellent service , furniture is totally stunning , quick delivery , excellent pricing .
2	well_done , extremely impressed , would not_hesitate to recommend the company to my friends , i will be back .
2	thanks again .
2	my mum was delighted with her flowers .
2	would it be possible to include some information about the flowers that are included in bouquets please ?
2	such as names , where they grow and any specific information for care .
2	the only_reason i ask is that mum is fascinated by the flowers in the polynation bouquet , some she has never seen before and would love to know more .
2	thank_you
2	it was a pleasure to shop with you it was , simple and easy excellent prices and very fast delivery .
2	outstanding service thank_you linda
2	i used this site for the 0st time a few_weeks_ago and would definately use it again .
2	items that i bought were good quality for value prices , would recommend them to family and friends .
2	i have been with orange for a few_years_now and i have only stayed with them because of the orange_wednesdays but even that has lost its appeal .
2	i find i have a lot of connection issues , it is always dropping the internet , and today when i was trying to get_hold of my daughters_school i couldnt get a signal , to be honest im sick of getting the sign which means no signal !.
2	i am done with this company but unfortunately i still have over a year to put up with it
2	was charged over double what the tickets actually cost ,
2	disgusted !!
2	!
2	i ordered them months in_advance too ...
2	i know tickets can cost a lot if trying to get them at the last_minute , but surely not months before , i was so shocked that i had been charged sooo_much extra , yes i knew i would be charged a bit , but more than double , viagogo is on a real good thing ,
2	i will never use this company again , stay away !!!!!!!
2	!
2	great seller
2	reliable service and superfast delivery in great packaging .
2	would recommend to anyone .
2	good service and commitment to their customers every time
2	oredered a mouse_mat with one of my photos as the theme .
2	loved it when it arrived , will be ordering again soon , and i got a discount too !
2	please_beware
2	advertised as uk registered company by actually conducts business out of hong_kong .
2	my order placed 0th_december still_hasn_'_t arrived .
2	i emailed the company several_times and they just don_'_t respond .
2	currently £_000 out of pocket .
2	it was easy to order and provide a scanned prescription .
2	the staff were very friendly on the phone when i had a query and the order was speedily sent out .
2	excellent service and will use again .
2	all as stated - delighted with product especially the extra height - would buy from this company again .
2	well i '_ll be using this company again !
2	got in a tight spot - almost out of cat_food before we went away for the weekend - no time to get out to buy and thought i '_d give this crowd a try .
2	great surprise - easy to order , very competitively_priced and the delivery was next_day and left where i had asked .
2	what more can you ask for ?
2	easy to order and great suppliers of fabulous quality lenses .
2	never had a problem with the delivery before but after nearly a month the dog was wasting away without his food .
2	apparently it came out for delivery , went on a journey and returned without getting to me !
2	hastily rectified though when i rang the customer_services team and it was delivered next_day !
2	i have been unable to access all of my orders on parcels0go statement if colleagues use their own email addresses instead of the registered one , the orders do not show on the history or the statement making it impossible to reconcile the cash balance on the account .
2	natalie was able to give me the 0_months order history i required and was very helpful .
2	i do think tho that the system needs to be changed so that every order placed shows on the account statement
2	i purchased a dell insipron netbook for my son '_s birthday , i called to check when stock was due and was told some was due that day and that they would call me when it arrives which they did but unfortunately stock did not arrive until the next_day but i was kept_informed all the way .
2	my order arrived the next_day i had an_email first thing on the day of it arrived with a delivery time , excellent will defenately use this site again
2	i wanted a new oak table and four_chairs for my new flat i am moving in to .
2	it needed to be one that can be extended and also i love oak so that was a priority for me .
2	i found this great company with truly reasonable_prices for the quality of the furniture , i couldn_'_t be more pleased with mine .
2	i would recommend this company to any of my family and friends .
2	the delivery was within the week of the ordered being placed and arrived on time , the delivery men were so polite , efficient and kind which really nice to know as well .
2	all in all a great find and i shall use again in the future .
2	thank_you !!
2	!
2	simple and easy way to get money for your old_phones money in the bank in two_days brill .
2	this is the company i recommend to my tai chi students .
2	cheap but good quality , reasonably fast service , and new lines introduced all the time so you can get all your pills at the same time .
2	" simple !"
2	prices competiitive , v good choice of birdfood for all situations , quick delivery , but most of all , really excellent , helpful and friendly customer service .
2	so much more rewarding to feed the birds what they want and need , and watch them gobble it all up , not just throw out the cheapest old stuff from local_garden_centres etc they dont like much ...
2	i attract a huge_variety of birds now !
2	( yellowhammers , reed buntings , pheasants who gobble up masses , and every kind of bird i could imagine ) - even moorhens wander up several_times a day and of course rabbits and other wild animals ( some not so welcome ) chomp away too !
2	only crit - can packaging be any more mouse / rat resistant ?
2	prob not at price ....
2	ordered wormers - no_hassles and prompt service .
2	goods arrived exactly as ordered when expected .
2	thank_you
2	ordered multiple items from a relatively expensive cricket helmet to a few cheap bat grips .
2	everything arrived promptly and was exactly as_described .
2	internet_shopping how i like it !
2	lost an elderly much loved collie ( with us 00 years ) and was looking for a replacement , when i came_across this website .
2	they had a puppy arriving that looked ideal , so completed the application_form and they rang to say they could do our home check .
2	the home check went_smoothly with the checker obviously happy to see how happy and healthy our other dogs were .
2	we then arranged to see the puppy - we had to wait a couple of days after he arrived from ireland so that they could properly assess him before we could meet .
2	ideally they like all the family to visit as taking a dog / puppy must be a joint family decision , not a single whim .
2	we met , feel in love and he has now been with us a year .
2	he has_been the most super addition to our family , and came used to a home , family and cats which is a big bonus unlike many dogs rescued from the larger animal_rescue centres where necessity means the dogs are kept in kennels .
2	thank_you
2	the service is first_class .
2	your items arrive quickly and well_packaged .
2	i would definitely recommend you shop with them .
2	excellant and quick
2	i have sold mobiles on this site before and had brilliant service but i recently_sold a mobile and chose bank_transfer and under 00_hours the money was in my account brilliant service !!

2	have been using petmeds since they started , never had a problem with them .
2	great prices , great service , would reccomend .
2	am an <_external link_removed_> customer of many_years .
2	lost times_now of the amount of collections yodel fail to collect .
2	in fact they have failed to collect every one , thats around 0 , these last few_months .
2	always ends up with <_external link_removed_> taking over .
2	not only that but why dont yodel reply to your complaint emails either ?
2	never known a company so bad , and look at the amount of neg reviews !
2	love this company .
2	fast delivery , free delivery and the cheapest price for flea / worm / prescription stuff too .
2	i was quite , nay , very afraid that i '_d book us for the wrong day , to the wrong destination , but so far , so good . the confirmation all looks exactly as it should . it was quick to work my way through the choices , and plenty of times left from which to choose , all prices clearly_laid_out . very happy with this company , thank_you .
2	i was making my first cup of tea of the morning , still in my dressing_gown , when the doorbell_rang ,& there stood a yodel delivery gent , who presented me with my parcel , ordered at lunchtime the day before . it really couldn_'_t have been a moment faster , i '_m impressed .
2	very helpful , resolved my issue quickly and with no_issues .
2	highy recommend
2	fragrance_direct are fab to deal with .
2	great products at amazing prices .
2	quick delivery .
2	never any hassle
2	there is a distinct theme on this thread which csl are clearly not addressing and which , sadly , is letting them down big time .
2	the sales_staff and buying experience in the store are very good .
2	there is a wide_range of choice and the furniture is comparatively good value for money .... when it arrives in perfect_condition .
2	where this company is seriously , and i mean seriously , falling over is in its abysmal customer after sales service .
2	particularly when the goods are not perfect through no fault of the customer .
2	even the manager of the store where we bought our sofa ( who we had to visit after our frustrations in getting through to customer service on the phone ) admitted that he is frustrated that the quality of after sales customer service does not back up the front line sales_staff .
2	we ordered our sofas in march_0000 , we got them in early july .
2	as i sit here on the last day of september waiting for a technician to deign to turn_up ... again , we still don_'_t have our ' perfect sofa '.
2	the technical call_centre have all the chat but , they just don_'_t have the service quality to back it up .
2	the most basic customer_care is completely lacking ... endless hours listening on the phone to how important our call is but still not bothering to answer it , failure to call back when they say they will , failure to do what they say they will when they do turn_up , failure to give reasonable time slots for deliveries and technical work ( t ' aint rocket_science that customers have to work to pay for this stuff !!
2	), blase scripted responses to enquiries , complete disregard for the cost to the customer of phone_calls and time off work , and complete_lack of anyone with balls making interventions to put right what they have done wrong .
2	i get it completely csl ...... we have landed in ' we '_ve got your money so you ' re stuffed ' ville .
2	i haven_'_t detailed all our issues on here because it '_s just more of the same as in previous posts .
2	would i recommend csl to anyone_else ...... no .
2	would i buy from them again ....... no .
2	with all this in mind , if you do still decide to go_ahead and buy , then my only advice is this - make the delivery staff wait_until you have checked every inch of your sofa / s , sit on all the seats , work all the mechanisms , check all the fabric / leather , they won_'_t like it but do not be hurried .
2	if you find anything wrong , no matter_how small , no matter what the delivery men advise ..... refuse to accept delivery and make them take the whole lot back .
2	if you don_'_t , be warned , you are heading for a nightmare and there will be lots that comes between you ( your sanity ) and your ' perfect sofa '
2	neff baking sheet delivered as_described and promptly .
2	would use them again .
2	website easy to use , goods received as_described and promptly .
2	certainly cheaper_than high_street suppliers .
2	the hotel was easy to find and would be ideal for anyone arriving by train although there was also ample free car_parking .
2	there was not as much noise from other rooms as we have experienced in other budget hotels which was good .
2	the bed was comfortable but a bit short and there were hard and soft pillows .
2	the room was very clean but the general areas were shabby .
2	the worst part was that the smoking area was right outside the entrance so we had to run the gauntlet of smokers to get in / out - not what you want in your best clothes .
2	there is a nice little seating_area by the river but this too was colonised by smokers so not pleasant for non - smokers .
2	there is also a little garden just for residents that we liked .
2	the staff seemed keen that we did not use the restaurant for dinner or breakfast which was odd .
2	presumably they get overly busy .
2	there is a tesco express near by so we got supplies from there instead .
2	although there are a lot of night clubs in the area it was well policed so we felt safe .
2	went to post_office at 0am thought charge was to high . returned home done internet_search and booked my parcel for collection after 00 . 00am
2	collected at 0pm by a very nice gent .
2	delivered next_day .
2	great .
2	will use again .
2	i have ordered quite a lot of item over the years they all arrive pretty quickly and they are great product '_s i alway '_s advise my friend '_s to buy from simply_supplement '_s and alway '_s tell them there product '_s are a lot_cheaper_than the high_street store '_s
2	we originally consulted sta with our round the world itinerary but the girlie there was one step up from useless .
2	a friend recommended travel_nation and i sent the same information to a consultant there ( picked carefully online from their useful staff travel experience breakdowns ) who phoned me back within 00_hours with a cheery answer - phone message and some well - researched ideas - not to mention enthusiasm .
2	he has_been absolutely first_class .
2	we are currently abroad and he is there for us at the touch of a button online .
2	his recommendations so far have been spot_on .
2	we are keen divers and he was able to point us in the direction of exactly where to go in places we hadn_'_t heard about .
2	this sort of detailed_information is invaluable .
2	and the cost of the rtw flights was astonishingly good value .
2	don_'_t_hesitate about using travel_nation .
2	( think_twice about using their insurers though .
2	endsleigh were hopeless .
2	i recommend you try true_traveller insurance for rtw policies that include everything - including scuba_diving down to 00 metres .)
2	i was impressed by the website but phoned to speak to a human_being about the intricacies of my insurance needs .
2	we took out a comprehensive adventure travel round the world policy for two middle_aged travellers .
2	tim answered my queries and was polite , efficient , friendly and helpful right from the start .
2	i felt safe .
2	compared to my endsleigh experience , true_traveller gets my vote every time .
2	mind you , i haven_'_t even left uk yet !
2	policy wise time will tell but i '_m rather hoping i don_'_t have cause to make a claim .
2	great customer service and good choice of goods .
2	highly_recommended .
2	i rang up for some advice and the fella who answered was very helpful .
2	i ended_up ordering a pair from these_folks and it arrived on time and well_packaged .
2	i would definitely recommend them .
2	great communications and cheery staff on phone .
2	they keep you informed every_step of the way and do what they say they '_ll do : refreshing and reassuring .
2	definitely use webtogs again .
2	wow !
2	no sooner had i sent off for my fantastic bargain offer that i discovered it had arrived within two_days of being ordered .
2	i had gone out thinking it would be much longer , but i should have known , having ordered previously from this excellent company .
2	the goods are always dispatched promptly .
2	this particular order was an extremely good bargain - two extra - sized print_cartridges and a pack of photographic_paper for a quarter of the price i would normally have paid for just one cartridge .
2	i heartily_recommend them and i never bother looking for anywhere_else .
2	the items were delivered promptly and are excellent value for money .
2	i am delighted with them and would recommend this company .
2	i '_ve been with janet fraser first then littlewoods for 00 years_now and would ' nt have been able to buy so much lovely things for my houses and xmas , of course for myself .

2	brilliant company to deal with very fast delivery and great communication an mobile was just as they said in add , would certainly deal with again .
2	keep_up the great work .
2	really dreadful experience with a sofa delivered on the 0rd .
2	wish i had seen these reviews before ordering a high value item from argos .
2	sofa arrived as promised but really was not good value , cheap and nasty , grey plastic legs etc ( cost was over 000_gbp ).
2	delivery guys said that there would be no problem returning it for a refund within 0_days .
2	so , trustingly sent it back .
2	have spoken to argos customer_services every day from the 0rd , they will not let_me have my money back , i keep being told that there is a problem with their system which won_'_t let them authorise a refund , has to be the technical_department .
2	promised return phone_calls , which have never happened .
2	no reply to emails .
2	staff disinterested and ill informed .
2	i am moving_house , can not move until i have a sofa and white goods , argos are holding my money .
2	there is no way i would recommend this shambles of a company .
2	nor will i spend any more of my money with them , as i intended , should i eventually get a refund .
2	i will be taking this to the citizens_advice at the first available opportunity .
2	just had a lovely conversation with katie she was really helpful at sorting_out my problem , she solved it very quickly
2	i rarely order from internet sites as i like to see what i '_m buying , but this tv_unit was just what we were looking for so order i did !

2	all there information is clear and easy to understand .
2	at no point did i get any nasty_surprises and they help with all of my special_requests and medical_needs .
2	my 00 year_old_son bought an acoustic fender package and having spent all his saved up pocket money ( and some of mine ) slightly over budget , saved on the postage by choosing free delivery ( 0 - 0_days ).
2	panic struck when he realised he ordered on a monday and 0_days would mean it might not be here by friday .
2	we had asked for delivery to our work address as we are here during the day , but away next week .
2	i called nevada , who were excellent and sorted it all out for me and the package arrived this morning ( thurs ).
2	i will have a very happy 00 year_old when i get home .
2	well_done , brilliant service .

2	i purchased a beko cxfd0000w fride /_freezer online on 00 / 00 / 00 .
2	the delivery date was scheduled for 00 / 0 / 00 .
2	we received a text on the 0th to say delivery would now be the 0th ( i have the original e_mail with stating the 00th ).
2	my husband had to take a day off work otherwise the delivery would have to be rescheduled .
2	so obviously customers requirements are immediately disregarded .
2	the item duly_arrived & our old fridge_/_freezer was uplifted .
2	we waited over 0 hours then swiched on , filling the freezer later that evening .
2	overnight the fridge heat up & the freezer defrosted all the contents .
2	money i can ill_afford to lose .
2	on contacting curry '_s & spending 00_minutes on the phone i was promised a replacement ( a further delivery of fridge_/ freezers expected on the 00th ).
2	i called back to - day ( 00th ) & was informed that expected deliveries did not if fact arrive .
2	possibly ?
2	they would be in the uk on the 00th .
2	( they are continuing to sell this product online ).
2	but that time it will have been almost 0_weeks since original order with no arranged delivery date .
2	i wish i had never looked on the curry '_s website & had just kept my old fridge_/_freezer .
2	i have also e_mailed curry '_s direct to complain_about the poor service , surprisingly i have not received a reply .
2	please if considering a purchase from curry '_s .......... look elsewhere .
2	not a happy & never again to be curry '_s customer .

2	i discovered expedia offer a small incentive on the site and booked my last flight through them , thank_goodness i did !

2	as a new customer i was delighted with the service ( fast delivery and good that the package comes through the post box ) the glucosamine 0000 i purchased was so much_cheaper_than other leading providers and it has really been successful for me - thankyou for explaining about the dose in your magazine so i knew to go for the higher one .
2	i was really happy with the service i received .
2	it was so easy to arrange a survey and they were able to complete the survey very quickly which was important to me .
2	after the survey we got almost_immediate spoken feedback which was great and then the report was very comprehensive and thorough .
2	a problem cropped up in relation to the house a few_weeks_later and i was very impressed when i phoned up to contact the surveyor to seek his opinion and he got back to me within 0 / 0 an_hour and took his time to run through the problem with me and reassure_me .
2	all in all an excellent service and very reasonable thankyou .
2	this is a fantastic concept and one which works really well .
2	we have used them twice and been totally_satisfied .

2	would wholeheartedly_recommend them .
2	excellent service extremely prompt and very well_packaged
2	why waste time trawling_round the shops ( we did and they were so unhelpful ) this was so easy .

2	i have used them regularly

2	i will suddenly remember an occasion that needs a card or gift .
2	the shops are closed , i '_ve no fuel in my car , i '_ve gotta cook the tea .
2	why should my friend or relation not get a card because of these reasons ?
2	because of moonpig they don_'_t have to suffer !
2	and that '_s why i like it !
2	i have family abroad and they think the cards i send are amazing !
2	so that makes me feel good knowing i '_ve sent them some happiness .
2	and it '_s moonpig i have to thank for that .
2	i ordered a mug for my husband on our_wedding_anniversary with our photo on it .
2	he had tears in his eyes when he saw it !
2	now that '_s worth_every_penny !
2	well_done moonpig !

2	i had problems booking a hotel online . ended_up with 0 hotel_bookings for the same dates .
2	phoned lastminute to explain . they were no help at all . this company takes your money but if anything_goes_wrong they ' re not interested .
2	best choice of flight + hotel deals , with a very varied budjet , and a good customer service back - up .
2	effortless and efficient from_start to finish and the most competitive price too !
2	ordered online and was kept_informed at every_stage of the purchase from order to delivery .
2	also was given a one hour time_slot for delivery which is so helpful as there '_s nothing_worse_than having to wait in all day not knowing when your goods are due to arrive
2	i bought a sub_standard ben 00 camera for my son and when i realised how poor the quality was , i tried to return it .
2	they said i could not because i had had it longer then 00 days , - i had bought it in_advance of his_birthday and then it was a week before we actually tried to use it .
2	i then tried to return it as faulty but they insist that i need to send it recorded delivery , at my expense , and if ( i think it will be when ) they find it not faulty , they then insist that i have to go and fetch it within 0_days .
2	stay away from lambda - tek .
2	if your product is sub_standard or faulty , you '_ll never get a return / refund .
2	they '_ll make_sure of that - they talk in riddles - go with a decent company , not them .
2	i have always had good service from this company - i have been using them for a couple years .
2	competitive_prices and fast delivery .
2	well_done to you all and thanks from me and my girl
2	this website is easy to use and your purchases are delivered very quickly .
2	two friends looking for a spur of the moment deal .
2	originally looking to go to icmeler in turkey .
2	we went into aspen travel and so pleased we did .
2	yvonne dealt_with us and the atmosphere was so relaxed and friendly we knew we were in safe_hands .
2	she found us a holiday to dalyan and my only_concern was it would be too quite .
2	she had contacts who had been many_times and phoned them whilst we were there to talk about my concerns .
2	we stayed at a fabulous hotel perfect for our requirements and the resort was exactly how she described it .
2	we did book last_minute so expected we may get a bargain compared to people who had booked in_advance but realised as soon as we got there what an amazing deal it was .
2	i will be going in today to thank her personally for a fantastic choice and will no_longer spend hours on the internet trying to plan holidays .
2	from now on i will leave it to the experts as they certainly know their stuff .
2	many_thanks yvonne from sue and jacqui .
2	i am so impressed by the service this company offers .
2	the prices were very reasonable , the flowers exactly as_described , and i was kept_informed by text during every_step from shop to delivery .
2	the recipient had also got flowers from another company that day , and her report was that they looked poor compared to the serenata_flowers .
2	i would definitely use again and not_hesitate to recommend to friends .
2	" i love the duvet .
2	it is so soft compared to my last one , and at that price couldn_'_t be_beaten !
2	i wasn_'_t sure about the ' stone ' colour of the covers , but have grown to like it , and they feel very fresh .
2	it would be great if you could offer a wider_selection of colours in this range . "

2	i looked about for a competative price for the quickstep laminate i wanted , and found it on flooring_supplies .
2	i was on a tight_schedule to have it fitted , working around the decorators , so needed a quick delivery as well as a good price .
2	i was going to order on line , but decided to phone to ensure my delivery day .
2	i spoke to a very helpful chap_called ian , who assured me my delivery would be with me next_day , and it was , and for free !
2	order placed at 0pm tuesday , delivered ( to birmingham ) the next_day by 0pm .
2	i also bought the product cheaper_than my floor fitter could get it from his regular supplier !
2	i will certainly recommend this compnay to my friends and would happliy purchase from them again - thanks !

2	the aftershave i bought was a very good price and i could have it despatched to my work address rather_than home - to make someone was around to take delivery !
2	quickly shipped and well_packaged - i will use you again , thanks !
2	i just found your website today by googling a product i '_ve never ordered before .
2	prices are great .
2	matching other competitors really worked great for me .
2	your website is top_notch .
2	found this website quite by_accident after mom said she she could note source blue grass perfume .
2	found them to be far cheaper_than the last bottle purchased and delivery was very quick , so if you are looking for christmas_presents , give them a try .
2	excellent transfer .
2	courteous , punctual and polite driver , nothing was too much_trouble .
2	most_importantly a very careful driver , thank_you .
2	will use sun_transfers again and recommend to friends .
2	tried to book through aviva extras but the holiday_autos site had a fault on it which made it impossible to book online .
2	so i reported it via_e_- mail and 0_days_later it was still not fixed .
2	so rather_than use their 00p a minute number , i used a uk number ( 00000_000000 ) supplied by their customer_services department .
2	when i said about the aviva corporate discount , they said they did not have one and refused to honour the price via our aviva site ( the fault came after that ) and to add_insult to injury said if i found another company who could give that price they would match it .
2	this is a fake site .
2	i placed my order , they took my money and then nothing .
2	they have no phone_call and emails responses are automated stating they don_'_t answer on may holidays .
2	this is a scam .
2	i have lost my money and am worried_about the security of the transaction .
2	this is a company based in china .
2	fantastic service .
2	i have only positive things to say about topcashback .
2	i '_ve been ordering heart medications for my dog at viovet for a couple of years_now .
2	the cost is almost_half what i would pay at a vet here in australia , after adding the delivery cost of 00 pounds .
2	in addition , the delivery arrives in under a week .
2	you are a godsend .
2	i recommend you to everyone i know .
2	happy with purchase so far but too soon to know if the meds i bought will work .
2	if all goes well i will be buying again and will be recommending to my friends .
2	i was recommended to priceline by one of my customers who raved_about the great deals she got .
2	this was my first experience so i didn_'_t really have much confidence bidding and went for a ' no bid " deal .
2	the whole_process was simple and i received instant notification of the place i would be staying at .
2	i checked trip_adviser reviews wondering what i '_d get for such a small price .
2	arrived at the hotel , amazing , i couldn_'_t have wished for better .
2	i '_ve added priceline to my f_/ b ' likes ' and would recommend to anyone .
2	i '_m looking_forward to having the opportunity to use the site again .
2	00 / 00
2	i found this site on google and had no problem booking my chosen hotel at a competitive rate .
2	i '_m sick of groupon .
2	it seems they are now scraping the barrel to get companies to sign up to offer a deal .
2	i have purchased several deals in the past .
2	o spa never delivered , groupon didn_'_t want to know and refused to refund .
2	other beauty deals reasonable but staff moan_about how badly groupon treats them so you end up feeling bad for them and giving a huge tip so no discount there then , restaurants - hit & miss , usually struggling businesses trying to drum up business and when you get your meal you know why .
2	now it seems to be only indian restaurants offering deals .
2	my biggest gripe is when a company fails to honour groupon don_'_t want to know .
2	i find now that many of the deals and available cheaper on amazon , ebay or online .
2	i '_ve also used kgb_deals , no_problems getting customer support or refunds with them .
2	i '_m totally sick of repeatedly watching the same ads every time i want to skip on .
2	i understand itv is reliant on advertisers but i get so infuriated it makes me never want to shop or buy from those suppliers .
2	ok , play ads at the beginning of the show but then allow the user to skip them thereafter .
2	hate hate hate it player , a complete_waste of time .
2	would highly_recommend , washing_machine was delivered on time , old one disconnected , new one connected and the old taken_away .
2	just a great service .
2	well_done ao . com
2	i '_ve_used serenata to send flowers and gifts several_times and really , they are great .
2	they have a very friendly approach , a good selection , reasonable_prices and the flowers arrive on time - and they keep you informed !
2	never had a problem , so i '_m happy to keep using their efficient and friendly service .
2	good t be able to book immediately , rather_than buying a voucher .
2	i have now been on three trips with t h secret locations , all have been exactly as_described .
2	perfect !
2	excellent service , great website giving history of prices paid and amounts purchased .
2	i even ordered oil when abroad this time .
2	i had set the heating to be on low so i didn_'_t think i needed much oil for a while .
2	then my son decided to come home so i thought i had better order some more oil to make ssure we didn_'_t run_out .
2	it was so easy .
2	no expensive calls and i knew i was getting a good price and would be able to rely_on the delivery being on time .
2	as usual the delivery was much earlier_than stated .
2	we have just printed our tickets for brussels airlines and find that we are not going to get meals which ebookers said we will be having on their confirmation .
2	just had a lengthy conversation with an ebooker customer service rep and after being put on hold for a while was then told i have to fill in a form on their website and attach the confirmation they sent us the form and it will be investigated .
2	we are flying first thing in the morning !
2	i know i for one will never use ebookers again and i haven_'_t even taken off yet !!
2	!
2	the first thing i thought a bit off , was when i first ordered on the website .
2	their email stated they were confirming an offer to buy , and would let_me know if my order was accepted !
2	there was no message_telling_me that the curtains i had ordered were out of stock .
2	when i tried to track the order , it said " dispatched " but i didn_'_t receive them .
2	when i started asking where they were i was told there was a delay .
2	but not before i had asked several_times .
2	i particularly_liked the pattern , so persevered , then found the next size was in stock so ordered them and asked for a refund on the other items .
2	these have eventually arrived !
2	several weeks from first order !
2	bought ' mensa genius ' mugs for the lads , and included different choice preserves .
2	these men in the family are notoriously impossible to buy for , but this year they all had a good laugh opening the parcels and finding a jar of something they liked and a mug , then when they tried them , they had a good laugh at the joke !
2	prompt delivery , well_packaged , thank_you menkind !
2	my rescued cat was probably guestimated to be about 0yrs_old , but only 0_yrs on has developed kidney trouble which involves blood_tests , medication and special food , so maybe much older .
2	as a pensioner of limited means this was devastating , and i began to think i would have to part with her , or let her suffer without either the medication or the special_diet .
2	i thought i would not be able to continue to buy both .
2	someone suggested buying online so i did some_research .
2	viovet have saved me from that dilemma !
2	they are affordable , efficient and very helpful .
2	i would recommend them unreservedly to anyone with this dilemma .
2	we have used the meet &_greet service on a number of occasions & will definitely be using it again .
2	there is no_hassle dropping_off your car & collecting it & you simply have to cross the road to the terminal .
2	( i don_'_t want to recommend it though as it might make it harder for me to use in the future !!!!)
2	the item i ordered was delivered very quickly well within the time scales and it was very well_packaged .
2	item arrived day after i ordered .
2	product exactly as_described .
2	couldn_'_t_believe this was so easy , and turnaround times were excellent .
2	ordered two iems from the twain walnut range .
2	was quoted 0_months delivery but they arrived in less_than 0_months .
2	quality was very good as was the service .
2	would love to buy again , just need to find the space !
2	very happy with purchases and speedy delivery thanks
2	rapid delivery .
2	great !
2	i ordered my batteries and they arrived swiftly as_described and with a little thank_you chocolate included - sadly i can '_t have milk_chocolate , but my husband can .
2	good service well executed .
2	when they batteries turned_out not to work for the purpose , i was advised straight_away how to return the goods via freepost .
2	my debit_card was refunded and i was able to order the other batteries .
2	a bit of tweeking was needed to help them to fit , but are now fitted and working , excellent !
2	the second order also arrived swiftly and with the little chocolate .
2	it '_s just a little thing , but it promotes a favourable response in me .
2	i would recommend battery_force anytime , in fact i '_ll probably point my husband in their direction .
2	after all , he '_s already received 0 chocolates ;-)
2	i ordered my product one evening , and it was sent out to me the next_day .
2	i received it neatly_wrapped and of course in excellent condition the day after .
2	i was delighted .
2	i would recommend stitchcraft again .
2	mind you , my sister recommended it to me in the first place .
2	impressive service but the actual metal feeder was slightly_disappointing as the lid keeps being knocked_off by the chickens .
2	poor design by the manufacturer and i '_d still use regency as a supplier .
2	we bought a replacement shower .
2	ordered one day , delivered the next - and at a very good price too .
2	excellent .
2	i almost missed getting the xbox one on launch date but simplygames still had some late availability .
2	the order process was easy , and no money was taken until a few_days before delivery .
2	emails kept me informed right the way through .
2	the delivery was brilliant .
2	i was given an_hour_slot , and was able to track the parcel literally street by street on the dps van .
2	quite superb service .
2	i ordered two_separate items , a couple of weeks apart .
2	postage was very reasonable , the items were well priced , and delivery was super quick .
2	i '_d certainly use them again .
2	received 0 tablets in a cardboard_box about 00x00x00cm with loads of paper packaging .
2	ridiculous waste , and i paid for it too with high p_+_p_charges .
2	surely a graded p_+_p system could be introduced , rather_than a blanket cost ?
2	just a 0 tier system , say under 000g or over ?
2	finally i find what i '_m looking for as i couldn_'_t find anyone who would ship this merchandise to the us !
2	!, they were kind , courteous , so very helpful and my package arrived very quickly and fast !... i love this store site and will be shopping there again :)!
2	hi
2	i have been paying £_00 per week to my vet for my dogs_medication .
2	viovet has supplied that medication for a quarter of the price .
2	the ordering was easy , you can scan a prescription and attach it to an e_- mail , and the delivery was excellent .
2	i would highly_recommend viovet to you all
2	i '_ve use chemist_direct several_times and i '_m always happy .
2	wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend to friends .
2	have used animed a few_times_now and will do again several_times i am sure , its great to get what you need at cheaper prices in the shops and you dont have to wait long for your goods either .
2	i have tried all_sorts of diets and this was recommended to me .
2	high protein and low in fats and carbs .
2	after only 0_days i lost_0lbs , i really hope this carries on to be so good , as i am finding it easier than having to think what to eat , how many calories , how many syns , calories or points .
2	it '_s really helping my pyschological state of mind too .
2	i '_m not hungry in between meals either .
2	i have a piece of fruit and a shake for breakfast , salad or cooked_meal and fruit for lunch , then a shake and fruit / yoghurt for tea .
2	i also ordered from zleeps and read on the website that my mattress_topper would be dispatched within 00_hours , however , after more than a week with no delivery i sent them a message via the website - the only way i could find of contacting them .
2	after_reading some of the reviews on here i was very nervous that i had been ' done ', and didn_'_t expect to receive either a reply or my topper .
2	however , i had a ' shipping confirmation ' reply the next_day , and my topper arrived the day after .
2	the topper itself seems to be good quality ( although it hasn_'_t been slept on yet ), and although the service was slower_than promised , i am now happy with my purchase .
2	so don_'_t give up yet if you '_ve ordered something .
2	perhaps i '_ve been lucky , but i suspect this company is fairly small and can '_t cope with the demand .
2	they need to change their website to be more honest about their delivery times , and make themselves more easily_contactable so that they can answer queries ( preferably by telephone ).
2	being hard to contact suggests to customers that there is something dishonest going on .
2	thank_you for my topper zleeps , and good luck to everyone else who has ordered - you may just need to be patient !
2	sent my iphone 0 for new screen paid for special next - day delivery 00000 said it had been sent on friday 00 july but wasn_'_t delivered on 00th as it should have been .
2	then they said it had been sent on 00 july but still no sign and now they don_'_t know when it was sent and can '_t give me a tracking order so what does that say .
2	i need my phone it '_s vital
2	contacted maid0clean to do an early spring_clean to my house .
2	prompt response to my enquiry followed up with a telephone_call .
2	organised service for time and date suited me .
2	as i was working away l left a list of what needed doing with my son .
2	fantastic job_done .
2	have used other cleaning services before and this was the best ever , at an affordable price to .
2	i will definitely use maid0clean again , and considering a regular service now too .
2	the new check - in is a great idea if only it worked !
2	there are many_times when i try to check - in when in a store only for the dialogue box to come up " you must be in the store to check - in " but i am !
2	it also states " try going outside the store to check - in " - make up your mind please !
2	it takes_ages to connect and quite_frankly i don_'_t have the time to stand about or going in and out of the store trying again and again to check - in .
2	otherwise i like quidco very much - getting paid for doing your usual shopping , it '_s win , win .
2	i ordered polish for my wooden_floor , the process was easy and the product arrived quickly , and it gives the floor a wonderful sheen - thank_you
2	the service was very efficient and convenient .
2	the parcel was very heavy so it was great that it was picked_up from my home and apparently delivered promptly and intact
2	fast , straightforward , efficient service and cheaper_than my optician .
2	our two mattresses are brilliant , the older one ( 0 years ) is now on our boat and still really comfortable . so satisfied we would not have any other make , no more back_ache and a thoroughly good nights_sleep .
2	excellent service and delivery .
2	thankyou mark and amanda
2	great value website compared to rivals with good stock level .
2	fast delivery .
2	customer service responded to an_email enquiry the same day .
2	i ordered a rucksack online thursday late_afternoon , and it was delivered to my door on monday at 0 :_00am .
2	i couldn_'_t wish for a better service and will not_hesitate to recommend this company to family and friends .
2	many_thanks to all concerned .
2	kind_regards

2	i think that booking with late rooms is ok but i found that the price they give you is not much of a saving i paid £_000 for bb but their price would have been £_000 so saving £_00 not much of a saving not worth going through you .
2	also the guest_house was not very good not worth £_00 a room £_00 is nearer the mark i think the hotel inspector should visit the staff can hardly speak_english and you have to explain what you want for breakfast and they still get it wrong . not impressed
2	i would recommend them to you they are very well made and not too expensive go on their site and have a look
2	bigdug is so good its easy to assemble and quick i '_m very impresed with these shelves can '_t wait to fill them .

2	i ordered made to measure vertical_blinds .
2	they were delivered promptly and are great .
2	very satisfied with purchase .
2	would buy again .
2	easy to do , very quick payment . i would do this again .
2	we ordered from this company on the 00th_september with a 0 working day delivery .
2	it is now the 0th_oct and no sign of our goods .
2	trying to contact them is a nightmare , their web_site won_' let you send a message no phone number to contact and when i finally found one it a premium_rate number at !, 00 per_minute to use .
2	i don_'_t know who writes 0_star reviews but it '_s the worst internet company i have ever dealt_with .
2	do not use this company
2	cheapest price available for my plinth_heater and delivered very quickly
2	i purchased a set of myjoys with a personal design , the order method for these can be complicated but golfsupports easily followed instructions made it simple , delivery was ahead of schedule and their estimated time to within an_hour was accurate .
2	parts delivered the following_day and at a competitive price .
2	great service - thank_you .
2	great website making it easy to select and purchase items .
2	order id 000000000 .
2	i waited for a while till the trip was complete before doing a review and had never ordered anything like this before , but the tickets all arrived promptly and the stadium tickets were already waiting at the hotel !
2	they found the hotel quickly and travelled by train to the stadium .
2	i rang the company a couple of weeks_ago to check i had done everything right and the staff were lovely .
2	i would definitely would use the company again as i have such a happy grandson !
2	we love simply_supplements and have used them for years . the turn round to deliver the products is amazing and such competitive_prices for good quality goods
2	i arrange to work from home for the day for our sofa delivery , which consisted of 0items .. 0sofas and a footstall .
2	only 0 sofa turned_up ..
2	no customer service number available to call ..
2	cannot keep being at home so extremely fed_up with poor customer service
2	i would definately recommend waltons - they were only ones i could get fence_panels from and the service was excellent .
2	excellent quality product as well .
2	i would recommend eflorist as fantastic same day service and excellent range to choose from
2	over the past 0 years we have ordereded 0 king , and 0 super_king_sized zip link beds from beds0u .
2	i was really impressed with the beds as well as the service .
2	we are frequently complimented on what comfortable_beds we have , and one recent guest asked where we got them from as they had wanted to renew their bed , and had found ours so comfortable that that was what they now wanted .
2	i would definately order beds from beds0u in the future , and would definately recommend the beds and the company .
2	sign up and reap the rewards you would be daft not to x
2	booked with travel_republic for the first time !
2	great price !

2	what a rip_off this company are .
2	my son booked a holiday with them and rang me last night to say he was asked to leave the hotel as alpharooms had cancelled his hotel .
2	i rang them and was informed they had changed the hotel a few_weeks back .
2	checked his emails - nothing from alpha_rooms .
2	eventually checked his junk_mail and there was one from a company called bookout informing him of a change to hotel as marco polo overbooked .
2	son then went to new hotel which was not in the area he wanted , was a dump and to top it all there was nothing booked in his name !
2	!
2	went back to marco polo hotel and paid himself to stay there as they did have rooms !
2	rang company asking for refund due to their cock up .
2	have spent three hours on phone now and still not getting a refund .
2	they are taking £_000 cancelation fee for the three nights he didn_'_t stop in a hotel that wasn_'_t booked in the first place .
2	great idea for a business if you have no conscience and totally arrogant .
2	customer service is diabolical , they just repeat themselves until they wear you down .
2	i was told that if i did not accept this offer and let things drag on it would cost me more money ,.
2	i will take this further as i don_'_t see why companies like this should be able to just rip people off and think the won_'_t do anything about it .
2	i recently sent flowers to friends in south_africa .
2	firtsly , i realised i had made a mistake on the message , e_- mailed interfflora within minutes of the purchase to ask if the message could be rectified ( there was an extra letter at the end of a name ) and was told this wasn_'_t possible even_though the flowers and message were to be delivered in a week '_s time .
2	i was also asked if i wanted a text_message notification of delivery , to which i answered yes .
2	i have yet to receive notification and had to ask my friends if they had received the flowers .
2	good selection of products and easy to use web_site .
2	added to this it '_s free delivery within a few_days .
2	this makes it my first choice for weight_loss and exercise related products .
2	i am very happy with my purchase of a new customised stethoscope .
2	i was spoilt for choice and enjoyed being_able to personalise my item .
2	great product , lowest_price , fantastic service & speedy delivery - can '_t ask for more than that !
2	wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend .
2	usually find what you are looking for and always at a good price
2	always plenty of good deals and offers good service to and home delivery if you want
2	great deals and service == very fast delivery
2	perfect place for finding great deals and bargains and no need to struggle with heavier items == home delivered
2	booked a taxi to take me to the airport , pre_- paid online as thought would be easier .
2	the taxi never showed up and when i called they had no record of this booking - they still took the £_00 from my account even through the taxi never arrived and have not replied to my emails since .
2	this company is to be avoided in my opinion .
2	all orders despatched and delivered with no delays o hassels .
2	quality goods too .
2	very impressed with your service .
2	will use it again
2	i like many people i see before me , are in a battle to get my money back .
2	i returned an item that was too small 0_days after i bought it i sent it back re ; the courier company use .
2	0_weeks_later still no refund i have contacted them several_times and all i can say is if you pay peanuts you get monkeys , because clearly their staff do not know what they are doing .
2	i have given them all the information they have asked for but they seem to be incapable of imputing numbers into a computer correctly .
2	as when the courier company got back to them the number was wrong no one bothered to contact me to let_me know .
2	i have now rung them again and have given the info again i have also contacted my credit_card company and they are going to launch there own investigation now .
2	so here we are , i '_m still out of pocket they are laughing as they have my money and the item and this seems to be a trend with them i think will contact watchdog about this company and their policies .
2	we had worked with groupon on and off for 0 years and to start with even_though we were paying a lot for the advertising we got quite good expose so we just ignored the cost but as time has_gone on , the service they provide has got worst we have had to wait weeks to get paid and this after they have had the money from our clients weeks if not months before hand , no business provides a service and then should have to wait weeks to get paid and then only after threatening legal_action do we get paid .
2	and to add_insult in injury there staff seem to think they can tell us what we should or shouldn_'_t do and expect us to work for free , why they reap the rewards .
2	we own our business and paid them for advertising that is all .
2	when we dared to argue about what service we should offer they will argue with us and push us to keep lowering the price groupon are only interested in them selves not the partners and not the customers and the service they provide is disgusting .
2	they seem to forget that without the businesses working with them and the customers buying the goods and services there would be no groupon they should try remembering that .
2	i bought an item with a delivery schedule of 0 - 0 working_days .
2	after waiting 0 working_days i contacted buydirect0u via_email and got an_email back saying that there had been an issue with stock .
2	nobody thought to email , ring or contact me at all to let_me know that there would be a delay but i was told that it was in my local_depot would be delivered today .
2	so i waited in all day and guess_what ..... it didnt arrive .
2	customer service is very poor it took 00_hrs for somebody to email me back , you cannot track your order on their site and when i rang up their telephone system apparently suffered a technical fault as i was explaining my issues and went down .
2	i only got a tracking_number after emailing them .
2	do yourself a massive favour do not use this company .
2	i am awaiting a refund and will review back again shortly .
2	update ... to be fair the refund was very quick .. a word of advice to buydirect .
2	just talk to your customers , keep them informed this way people will know where they stand .
2	i would not of minded the wait if i had been told ......
2	still disappointed overall .
2	if you want to go to see girls aloud or any other group , i would recommend this company as a good place to buy tickets .
2	easy to follow_instructions , prompt delivery , all you could wish for .
2	hi , i have been on miniinthebox site again , i love this site as i can get whatever i need for my iphone and ipad , the site is so easy to find what you want , the prices are good and they deliver your order quick , i have always been very happy with the items that i have brought and never had any_problems with this company .
2	i certainly do recommend them to everyone as they not only have the normal items , you can also get some different items that you have not seen before .
2	the flowers arrived when needed , in a excellent condition looking absolutely_beautiful , i am very happy with the service in which i received from this site , would use them again any time
2	used daniel at dialaflight for several_years_now to book our flights and car_hire to the us , each time has_gone_smoothly and i cannot recommend them highly_enough , great service , what more can you ask .
2	already_planning next years trip .. 0_*
2	needed a washer_/ filter for our grohe shower , but the model wasn_'_t listed on the website .
2	a quick phone_call and the chap quickly identified which part we needed , gave_us the model_number so that we could enter it on the site and check from the picture that it was correct ( he stayed on the line whilst we did this ).
2	then we ordered it on line and the part was with us very quickly .
2	excellent service :)
2	excellent service - so quick , simple and all at a very reasonable cost .
2	highly_recommended ( htc_wildfire )
2	excellent experience from_start to finish - easy to order , good price , fast delivery , well_packaged
2	was a bit_wary of oneclickpharmacy as had read some poor reviews last_year .
2	decided to take the chance as product was considerably_cheaper_than elsewhere .
2	items were well_packaged and arrived quickly .
2	would recommend and use again
2	i love the fact you can download month by month growing tips for poly_tunnel growing and if you need help and advice you can either post a question on fb or phone the company for advice and someone will get right back to you , i would love a poly_tunnel on my allotment as it would be an excellent addition to extend my growing season
2	i was looking to book a single_trip from jersey to st malo in july .
2	this site was really easy to manage and the booking simple - would recommend and definitely will use site again .
2	i have used interparcel twice and both_times the item was collected the day they said it would be and delivered within a couple of days .
2	i like the idea of paying an extra 00p to have a text_message_confirming safe delivery .
2	well_worth the money .
2	the shoes are excellent and delivery exceptional .
2	twice i have paid_extra for a next_day delivery only to find out the companies used yodel - i hate them they have their own agenda .
2	how can we , the customer , convince the selling companies to stop using them .
2	had a terrible issue with the recipient '_s address in norway .
2	the whole_thing took over an_hour to resolve online through no fault of yours .
2	[_name_] dealt_with it all very professionally and was extremely polite and friendly throughout .
2	she offered a solution by using an aternative courier and sent me online confirmation so i was able to finalise matters .
2	thank_you very much [_name_] for all your help .
2	you are very efficient and a credit to your company .
2	you really did save the day !
2	i was delighted to find this clothing rail .
2	i was looking for something sturdy and this rail exceeds_expectations .
2	it '_s excellent quality and fits together very easily .
2	superb value for money and excellent , speedy dispatch .
2	i can '_t fault the service and i '_m happy to recommend this company and product to everyone .
2	the mousemats were very good and i was delighted with them .
2	also such a fast delivery , wow !
2	i have used holiday_autos for the past two years , having been introduced through a friend .
2	this includes renting cars in both europe and the usa .
2	i have always had excellent prices , and very good service with whichever car operator i am booked with .
2	i would always recommend them
2	your site is so easy to use and the prices were amazing !
2	thank_you for helping america stay in biz :)

2	i have been really impressed by the customer_care i have received .
2	the videos of products were really good and clear .

2	your company did exactly_what it said it would , how refreshing !.
2	well_done and i will definitely be recommending you to my friends .”
2	the quote was quick and easy to understand .
2	i have used prestige before and trust the arrangments .
2	excellent service , prompt delivery
2	the website is easy to use and they seem to have better bargains than many of the other booking sites , without the hidden_extras that sometimes bump up the cost .
2	i '_ve just booked my third holiday through them because i feel i can_trust them .
2	we took_advantage of a brilliant cheap 00 hour return deal to see some of the countryside and beaches near calais .
2	the ferry was a little late going out but we didn_'_t mind that .
2	with a crossing of only an_hour and a half we were happy to sit and read until land was in sight .
2	driving off the ferry and onto the road south was easy .
2	we had a real problem on the way back though with finding our ferry boarding point in the huge calais terminal .
2	we missed it completely , eventually realised we had gone too far and had to turn round and drive back .
2	we only found it in the nick of time .
2	apart_from that slightly unnerving experience it was a great trip and terrific value for money .
2	i had previously bought sheets from dapw and they were excellent quality .
2	i haven_'_t used the towels yet but it '_s obvious that they ' re of the same excellent quality , and i '_m looking_forward to using them .
2	great designs , excellent service and to be very boring .... they wash very well !
2	my teenage_sons love them , particularly as celebs keep appearing in them !
2	this is the 0rd mattress i have ordered from zleeps & i have not been disappointed the outside packaging is always a bit_battered & torn but because the mattresses are always so well_packed in cellophane it '_s not been a problem tnt is the selected carrier for this area .
2	although i would not rate them zleeps delivery is always punctual from there end ( just a pity tnt are not !!)
2	:(
2	all i can say is if u want a gd nights_sleep pick one of the mattresses as i '_ve ordered gold & platinum & have not been disappointed .
2	good communication , service & delivery - highly_recommended in fact i have for a few friends ( should be on commission !)
2	thanks
2	lorna ( ellon absrdeenshire )
2	these items were ordered , dispatched and received in double quick time .

2	i use parcel_monkey regularly as they are the cheapest delivery company in the uk .
2	they collect on time and deliver quickly too .
2	best delivery company ever !
2	this is service we all look for and rarely find .
2	efficient and fast with contactable , helpful staff .
2	00 out of 00 in my view .

2	what more could you ask for ??

2	i ordered the bcib after_reading an article about it .
2	i have an operation pending in august and i '_ve been told i need to lose_weight .
2	i have tried every diet going and i always lose will power within 0 - 0_weeks .
2	my appetite has decreased since i started eating more high protein and less carbs but my sweet_tooth remains .
2	so i thought i '_d give bcib a try .
2	typically , i ordered 0 bottles and shakers and then i saw all the negative_reviews .
2	i basically thought i '_ve list £_00 because i am not going to get the products .
2	lo and behold u received both bottles within 00 days of ordering .
2	but there was no shaker .
2	apparently they are out of stock so i '_ve received a discount_code for my next order .
2	that was a bit_cheeky .
2	anyway u tried the product with orange_juice first thing in the morning .
2	and made 0 more during the day with water and had a chunky soup with chicken , beans and veg for dinner .
2	well 0_days in with a healthy dinner and i '_ve lost_0lbs !!
2	!
2	it does taste vile , but i mix it and drink it down really quickly .
2	i '_ve decided i '_m going to try one week on bcib and one week off .
2	i am sorry for all those people who haven_'_t received their product but when you do , it does work .
2	it '_s not difficult and as long as you drink plenty if water it will work it seems .
2	so i am very happy .
2	urban_decay naked foundation .
2	was worried that no .
2	00 looked reddish when squeezed on the back of my hand .
2	but applied it on and it blended in really well .
2	i '_d say it was medium coverage .
2	last well .
2	had to apply face powder 0 hours_later .
2	which isn_'_t bad for my 00 year_old combination skin .
2	compared to laura mercier skin teint and mac sculpt i prefer the urban_decay for my summer makeup because
2	a ) feels weightless
2	b ) good colour_match
2	c ) good price
2	so easy phone the number ask for brendan he made my trip to new_york so easy did all arrangements all you have to do is pay thank_you for making my 0st trip to usa great
2	good choice fast delivery and flowers in good condition when arrived
2	i have to say i rang this company for advice and felt very confident that i ordered my goods from them and then not only did i get great advice and help from friendly staff , but because i called before 0pm i actually received my goods the very next_day !
2	i even had a text from their courier company to tell me when they were coming within an hours notice !!!
2	not only were they competative on price they made my life_easier as i didn_'_t have any codes only descriptions to give and it didn " t matter !!!!
2	all i can say is hats_off to physique , i shall_certainly be ordering again from you guys !
2	thank_you
2	thought i would give asos a try and ordered 0 items .
2	after a week i received an e_mail saying one of the items was out of stock ( even_though when i checked on their site it was still available to purchase ).
2	they said they would refund me and 0_days_later that has still not happened .
2	the other item was 0 packs of socks and this morning a tiny package was put through my letterbox and inside was one pack .
2	now these socks were supposed to be a well_known_brand but are the poorest quality socks i have ever purchased and the inside if full of dangling threads which i imagine would get caught in your toes when putting on .
2	asos have no contact number and no e_mail address and you literally have to go through loops on their automated answer system to send them an e_mail .
2	just the fact that they do not have contact details would stop me using them again .

2	i am impressed by the staff '_s dedication to go a long way to do so .
2	i gave them a list of attributes i was looking for and they practically took each product out of the shelf to describe it in detail , spending considerable effort and time in doing so .

2	excellent service , good website and quick delivery
2	i bought the three_seater electric recliner sofa and chair after_spending much time deliberating in the shop - the most expensive there .
2	when it arrived there was a rip on the side of the cushion on the chair and a gap_between the two sections of sofa as well as stitching out and loose staples underneath .
2	upholsterer came out and i said i was unhappy , he said it had to go higher .
2	the store manager came out and noted concerns and agreed it was under foamed .
2	he said he would take it to the shop and sort it and that this would make the gap less .
2	went to look today and is indeed better foamed but still a gap .
2	i became very upset as £ 0000 is a lot of money to spend .
2	i said that it may have been helpful to be informed when i purchased it there would be a gap but was told it would be assumed i knew that ( the one i sat on in the shop didn_'_t have one but was not a three_seater ).
2	i am deeply unhappy and wish i '_d never purchased a sofa there .
2	this is a huge_amount of money to me , even_though it '_s on finance .
2	i have been told they will be delivering the sofa back to me as it is now mine .
2	i will be researching to see if i can take this further , but in truth , don_'_t think i '_m strong_enough to fight and will just accept something i don_'_t want .
2	i will never shop there again .
2	this is an amazing site where you really do earn_money buying things you would be buying anyway !
2	i bought bath_taps here as they were the best value for money i could find after_trawling the web .
2	ordering was simple and delivery was very swift .
2	i would recommend .
2	i am very happy with my wren kiitchen and the service provided .
2	although i had it installed by a local builder the support i received from beginning to end was fantastic .
2	the price i paid for my solid_wood door kitchen was circa £ 0000 cheaper_than their_competitors .
2	i would not_hesitate to recommend them to friends and family and i will use them again if i need to .
2	i chose house_network for the marketing of my property because of the good feedback i saw on property forums .
2	i have not been disappointed .
2	they provided me with an excellent service .
2	on the first week of marketing i had many viewings and 0 offers .
2	the house sold straight_away .
2	the advertisement that appeared on the various property portals was very professional and much_better_than the ones from my local_estate_agents .
2	the photographs of the property and the virtual tour were excellent .
2	every time i had a query it was dealt_with the same day .
2	i will definitely use them again in future and i thoroughly_recommend them specially if people want to save themselves lots of money .
2	used simply_supplements everytime i need vitamins_etc , they are so good on delivery , the website and ordering is so easy to use and the products are excellent - you ought to try them and like me you will become a valued_customer --- go on give them a go
2	ordered my lightbulbs and they were here within 0_days ---- great !
2	only_downside was the fact that i stated where to leave them if i was out , even_though it said on my package they were left at my neighbours which is good but no card was left by_fedex so i didn_'_t even know they had arrived , lucky i '_ve got honest neighbours .
2	will order from here again though , maybe just a one off by delivery guy .
2	great value , great service ....
2	i bought a barbour_jacket through this company .
2	not only was it the best value on the internet it arrived within the timescale and perfectly packaged .
2	can '_t get better_than that
2	looking for the cheapest car_parking , but close to the airport .
2	found all of this with manchester_airport car_parks .
2	i haven_'_t tried everything yet , but so far so good .
2	i am surprised that a mail order company can deliver such good quality food .
2	i will order again .
2	the service is second to none .
2	i have been using viovet for a while now , and have never had any_issues .
2	my order has always arrived within 0_days depending_on the time i place my order , and has always been correct .
2	i also like the fact that i get a reminder that my cats need fleeing or worming , otherwise i would forget haha !!
2	well_done viovet .
2	ordered part midday 00th_sept , part arrived 00am 00th_sept , to stornoway , outer_hebrides thats what you call service ,, shower working in just over 00_hrs from ordering .

2	this website was really easy to use , had lots of choice and delivered to me quickly and when promised .
2	i wish more companies were like this !!!
2	!
2	discounted heating offered this product at a really good price over the internet .
2	it was all hassle_free .
2	i also got a call saying that their supplier was having a problem with stock and that they would be day late with the delivery .
2	i was offered options about what to do
2	excellent customer service keeping_me informed
2	0_stars
2	ordered a new motor for my dyson along with some new filters .
2	once ordered got an_email to say the motor was out of stock ( which it did say on the website ) but they would let_me know as soon as it came in .
2	they sent the filters straight_away .
2	received another email letting_me know the motor was in stock and en_route .
2	quicker_than first expected too .
2	prompt over sea delivery .
2	can '_t fault any part of the service
2	i bought a dress from debenhams over a week_ago , it was in their sale_section and it was just what i was looking for to wear at an_upcoming_wedding .
2	now i have had an_email_saying it was priced wrong so they have canceled my order and i will get a refund in five days
2	i find both the cancelling of my order and the fact i have to wait for my money for five days terrible service
2	won_'_t be using them again that '_s for sure .
2	hi , this service was spot_on , we were told it would be delivered on the day stated and it was at the door by 0 . 00am .
2	not often these days that you get a 0st_class service like that .
2	driver was also helpful and friendly .
2	i would recommend anyone to use uk mail .
2	well_done guys :-)
2	great company and not expensive products .
2	put details in your address book
2	ordered two wetsuits for our boys .
2	fantastic value and a very fast efficient service .
2	would definitely buy again from wetsuit_outlet .
2	opened the door this morning and was very dismayed to have my parcel that i thought was well on its way to my daughter in australia returned to me !
2	ruined my day !!
2	managed to speak to emma in online_chat and she very calmly sorted_out an excellent solution and turned my frown back to a beaming smile !!
2	thanks emma if only other_organisations could do this !
2	!
2	i bought 00 of the beckham sport sets for less_than £_00 saving a wopping £_000
2	i search the net and no one could come near the price .
2	one happy_bunny !!!
2	!
2	i received an_email which i think was very rude , from customer_services after complaining an order was a completre waste as photograh was on half of the front and half of the back of welcome card !
2	!.
2	i also think the hidden_charges are very high .
2	i would never use this company again because of the rude remarks from their so called customer_services , and would advice others to keep away from them .
2	thanks to [_name_] my enquiry was answered quickly & efficiently .
2	problem sorted .
2	:)
2	after shopping with fragrance_direct for a few_years_now i have never had any problem whatsoever with their service .
2	they have always been very helpful and friendly .
2	my parcels always arrive in excellent condition and packed really well .
2	their prices are very good compared to the high_street prices .
2	brilliant company and service .
2	this is such a great way to transport things .
2	i found it easy to use and the people involved were friendly and efficient .
2	i cannot_fault it .
2	i will be using this service again !
2	the item i ordered was very competetivly priced and with free and quick delivery .
2	i saved about £_00 over the same product from other_sources .
2	a very happy customer !
2	would recomend to all wanting trouble free transfers 0_* , on time curteous service . wiil deal with again & again

2	i was really happy with the service i received and my friend is absolutely_delighted with the flowers !
2	!
2	we use sun_transfers a lot for our daughter who is studying_abroad .
2	always on time and helpful drivers .
2	good clean cars are used .
2	never had any_problems and would recommend to anybody .
2	i found this site easy to use and understand .
2	the advert price was very reasonable and the photo upload was a piece of cake .
2	very well run with advert going live very quickly .
2	it would be nice to have a view counter on the advert so people could see what kind of interest their advert is receiving .
2	also for the benefit of the site it would be good if when a car was sold the advert remained on the list for a few_days with a " sold " banner across the pic .
2	this would advertise the success of the site .
2	overall a great experience and i am happy because i sold my car in a couple of days .
2	instant_response from alex on the helpline and instant solution given .
2	great , thank_you .
2	wish all providers could be like this .
2	all the above , plus it '_s even better since i find it very difficult to buy refresh eye_drops in shops now .
2	only had my dryer a few_days , so early to comment on efficiency and quality . if looks are anything to go by , i will be very satisfied . my ordering experience was smooth and delivery and customer service spot_on .
2	i have used petshop_bowl about four times_now and i am very happy with the product . even happier with the price and the customer service they afford . i have had one problem with yodel when they lost my order and as other customers stated they tell you to contact the supplier , they are not interested .. petshop_bowl apologised and promised if they could not trace the order they would send out a new one . the same day it arrived in a replacement battered box , although the dog_food sacks were fine . i complained to yodel about their sloppy manner and a very disgruntled lad who definitely was not happy in his job . they ignored me but i used them again as they come free delivery from the company and the point is to save money . since then i have no_complaints . it is definitely yodel who need to look at their delivery not petshop_bowl who i am very happy with . so petshopbowl full_marks . yodel , i reserve my opinion , time will tell .
2	my order of a cd unit with drawers was made in the hopes it would match the one i have . not only is it barely different but it arrived in double quick time . it was in perfect_condition , well_packaged for protection and carried in by a very pleasant and helpful chapi am very pleased with the price as i had searched the net and found lifestyle_furniture to be the most competitive . i will definitely recommend them to friends and would purchase from them again myself .
2	really love fragrance_direct for the fab offers . it means i can buy lots more perfume and try some that i would not normally take a chance on . hope they always keep_up these prices ..
2	on my second box of aromo coffee_pods . best i have had and how could you not take_advantage of their free trial offer . i will be using these from now on . good price , excellent delivery times .
2	i like artifolk !
2	- good website , competitive_prices and outstanding service .
2	this is a really impressive company .
2	i had text and email_updates indicated the hour that michaela ( delivery driver ) would be arriving at my home .
2	i could even see the van as it moved around the rural lanes of suffolk - in fact the website showed updates such as van currently on delivery drop 00 - your delivery is number 00 .
2	michaela duly_arrived and was very polite , cheerful and smartly_dressed and needless to say my package was in perfect_condition .
2	this company provides a much greater level of service than any of its main_competitors .
2	i '_d like to make clear that i have no association with interlink or indeed ( to my knowledge ) any of its employees .
2	i have been wanting this perfume ever_since i smelt it when it first came out early this year but sooo expensive .
2	found it on here , over_£_00 cheaper !!!
2	and with 0 small tester bottles of the same perfume , a free bottle of ghost and free delivery !!
2	it arrived within a couple of days very well_packed and is noiw sat under the tree all warpped for christmas !!
2	thanks fragrance_expert
2	we ordered a kitchen_sink and monobloc tap .
2	they arrived very promptly but ....... it was the wrong tap .
2	contacted immediately via their abyssmal ' submit a request ' utsumi help_desk .
2	got a response after a few prompts stating when they could not deliver and what i had to do and not do and on and on .
2	emailed back asking for the ' correct tap ' to be delivered the next_day .
2	then on checking the sink and trying to get it fitted , the waste system did not seem to fit , in fact when it was fully checked , it was over 0 inches short and the wrong angle .
2	well this was over 0_days ago and the last response i had was yesterday morning asking me to respond by 0000 if i wanted delivery today , i responded_immediately but of course nothing .
2	we have sent images of the sink and told they would go to technical_department .
2	i sent images to the actual sink company who responded the same day to say it looked like taps uk had sent us the wrong waste system .
2	i have now opened a dispute via pay_pal and will contact my credit_card tomorrow .
2	talk about waste of time and frustration , never mind the fact that we have no kitchen_sink or tap ( i am too scared to go and buy one elsewhere as we cannot_afford to lose this money ). i have no idea what else to do now , they really do not have a care for customers and tehy seem to get away with it .
2	maybe next step will be trading_standards ?
2	using hifx is so easy , it shows the rates of currency , ' live ', literally changes in front of your eyes .
2	i have used them 0 times_now and each time it is so quick and speedy .
2	the money is transferred ( to australia ) within a couple of days , never any_problems .
2	best prices anywhere .
2	in these economic times it is good to find someone not ripping_off the customers .
2	communications were spot_on , delivery as promised , i will definitely be using for all my dogs needs in the future .
2	thank_you petshopbowl !
2	i ordered three batches of prints from different companies .
2	photoworlds arrived days ahead of the rest and earlier_than their delivery times .
2	quality was spot_on , i had colour corrected them all myself .
2	fantastic service , sammie_taylor was more than helpful .
2	we have just taken order of some bedroom_furniture .
2	i cannot say how pleased we are with the quality of the furniture and the fantastic customer service we have received .
2	the furniture was delivered on time and the delivery men were extremely polite .
2	i would have no_hesitation in recommending your company to others .
2	thank_you very much .
2	jane perry
2	beaconsfield , bucks
2	such wonderful service !
2	and they arrived quickly , good quality lenses at a price
2	you can_afford .
2	what wonderful service .
2	i am amazed !
2	the arrival time far_exceeds anything imagined and i '_m in florida .
2	i '_ve been with another for 00 years_now i '_m switching due to such great customer_relations .
2	i always buy through amazon if possible .
2	the company sell most things nower days and the goods has always been delivered quickly .
2	if there is a delay they let_me know by email .
2	i wished i had read the reviews before being tempted to order from this company .
2	i have ordered 0 different articles and in five weeks only two of them have arrived even_though money was taken for the goods on ordering day .
2	one of the orders has_been returned , which i know will take an age to get a refund - plus its cost me an extra £_00 for p_&_p for a double duvet_cover value £_00 which was crap !
2	i always find travelex the best way to get my travel money .
2	easy to order online .
2	quick to collect at the airport .
2	and their rates are pretty good too .
2	having been sent a small rubber gasket instead of the shower_hose ordered and paid for , i have emailed 0 times over 0 working_days and have had no response apart_from a recognition that they have my email and are working on it !!!
2	not happy .
2	would rather give no stars .....
2	i have always relied on my partner to sort any_problems with my car , so when i got a flat_tyre i was very worried_about finding the right tyre to replace it , with etyre the ordering is simply to find the right one booking the time and place you need them to come , i was uncertain i had ordered the right tyre so i gave them a quick call and spoke to a very helpful person_who made sure i had got what i needed , they showed up on the time_slot made and changed the tyre very quickly even showing me the bolts were tightened sufficiently
2	i really wish i had read the reviews on here before i sent 0 phones to them for repair .
2	i sent them on june 00rd .
2	one was water_damaged and was to be investigated .
2	0_weeks_later its still being investigated , with no progress_report or hint of return .
2	the other had a cracked_screen which was replaced and returned after 0_weeks .
2	the screen was badly fitted and didnt work properly .
2	it was returned to them and received on 00st_july and since then nothing .
2	i have emailed their help_desk numerous_times without_any reply .
2	i have phoned 0 times and got through once to be commisserated with and told someone would contact me to tell me whats_happening .... no contact .
2	as i write this i am on hold again ( currently at 00_minutes and im supposedly caller no 0 !)
2	i just want my phones back repaired or not .
2	i have posted on their facebook_page .
2	they clearly monitor this as within 00_minutes each time the post has_been removed .
2	tweets go unanswered .
2	clearly nobody at repairs0 actually_cares_about their customers and tries to sort_out the issues .
2	i would urge_people not to use this company .
2	finally got through and apparently both devices are being returned to me by courier tonight .
2	i will be very relieved when i have them both in my hands .
2	very good service .
2	personal communication and delivered against a tight_deadline .
2	thanks all
2	nothing more to say !!
2	all good .
2	honest , straightforward , quick and fair .
2	perhaps not the highest prices out there but if your phone is what you claim , you will get an easy quick hassle_free sale .
2	it '_s a no - brainer .
2	i purchased some dressing_table mirrors from this company .
2	there was no charge for postage and the goods arrived promptly .
2	however , when we tried to assemble the mirrors they were discovered to be faulty .
2	the company would not agree to a full_refund and payment for the return postage .
2	they wanted to charge me an administration charge of 00_% plus return carriage .
2	after much negotiation , i managed to get the admin_charge dropped but i still paid for the return carriage .
2	i just wanted to end the mess and although i could have gone to the small claim court i really couldn_'_t be bothered .
2	tread carefully with this company and know your rights !
2	amazing .
2	i ordered 0 bags of dog_food which were £ 0 per bag less_than i usually pay and the whole lot was delivered free within 00_hours or order !
2	the web_site said 0 - 0_days but it arrived well_packaged the following_day .
2	i can '_t recommend this company enough - may even have to get another dog so i can order more from them !
2	!
2	i ordered a samsung camera as a gift for christmas and it arrived within the specified lead time ( shipped direct from hong_kong ) but with the wrong plug on the battery_charger - it had a european_plug instead of the uk one .
2	after several emails , a travel adapter was sent out which is not the perfect_solution but does not mean that my husband can use his camera !
2	i have used this company several_times_now , i always find them the cheapest on the horse supplements i buy and deliveries are really efficient and free .
2	could not ask for more really
2	i have ordered twice from gfg ( both on line ) and both_times the delivery has_been so quick i think they both despatched the day i placed the order and arrived the next .
2	no postage is a great bonus on top of their already good prices .
2	on the first order one item i ordered was out of stock and i received a really helpful phone_call telling_me and offering me an_alternative plus advising me on sizing which turned_out to be spot_on .
2	i would not_hesitate in recommending gfg and will be using again .
2	no_problems , delivered within time_scale and at a third of the price royal_mail wanted to charge
2	we ordered a wireless thermostat for our gas_boiler .
2	the customer service person was very helpful on the phone , and the product was delivered to us within two_days .
2	they sent regular_emails to inform us when delivery was due .
2	we '_ve_used viovet for a couple of years after another dog - walking friend recommended them .
2	we get food , treats , and prescription tablets from them now .
2	on the one occasion we had a problem , i was really impressed at how well and quickly the customer service team dealt_with it .
2	they called me back and were following it up all the time .
2	every_penny counts these days , and viovet is the most competitive on price of any website that i '_ve seen .
2	good , clear write - up and photo made it easy to choose which cover suited me .
2	arrived very quickly and well_packaged .
2	can '_t find any fault .
2	happy customer !
2	highly_recommended !
2	best choice i '_ve found for treats for your small furries , always something to please even the most discerning of tastes .
2	prompt delivery straight to your door .
2	can '_t fault them .
2	can '_t fault battery_station .
2	ordering is easy , combined with speedy delivery , what more could i want from them ?
2	this is where i '_ll be buying my batteries from now on .
2	i '_ve bought from here several_times_now and cannot_fault them .
2	website is easy to use , there '_s plenty of choice to cover any requirement and service is excellent !!
2	goods are very well_packaged for transit .
2	the only_thing i can '_t comment on is their complaints_procedure , as i '_ve never had cause to use it .
2	always first_port of call and so far , never needed a second port
2	from a very happy customer .
2	they stock essential ( to my bunny , anyway !)
2	items that i can '_t find anywhere_else , on an easy to use website , and they deliver them quickly .
2	what more could i want ?
2	our equity_release has_gone_through without a hitch and in just a few_weeks .
2	our adviser geprge wotton was very helpful and has kept us informed all the way through .
2	we would thoroughly_recommend key_retirement_solutions to everybody .
2	excellent service , euros ordered friday am delivered saturday am brilliant .
2	thanks .
2	we ordered a £_00 . 00 bq to be delivered to where we work in halifax .
2	a corporate venue in the town_centre ) we asked for early am delivery as it was for a presentation at a collegues retirement .
2	the flowers arrived at almost 0 . 0pm and were disgusting .
2	three stems of yellow crys , four old geminas .
2	three limp iris , two old shamrock crys blooms and some purple limonium .
2	tied like a hand_tied and wrapped in left overs from halloween .
2	omg .
2	i felt so humble and embarressed as all the office staff stared at me while i tried to put the mess right .
2	impossible .
2	the ' shop ' that delivered the flowers ' scentiments of wibsey ' were not available to take a phone_call .
2	i drove to the shop with the bq to find it dident exsist only to be told by the hairdressers where it used to be " she went last_year and works mobile from her van " !!
2	omg .
2	where i appreciate that iflorist do a great job usually as ive used them many_times and always been happy with the flowers i do feel they need to visit the shops they have registered with them as some are not shops but con women posing as florist shops .
2	ie .
2	scentiments of wibsey .
2	ive posted a photo of the pile pf poo the shop sent for 00 . 00 .
2	i could have got better for 0 . 00 at the co - op .
2	!
2	ordered two bottles of shampoo , highly delighted with purchase
2	initially sent without fittings or instructions .
2	fitting_instructions poor , one a0 sheet of paper which only a fitter would be able to decipher .
2	bought tuin grande gazebo , oringinally quoted £_000 fitting by the company which fitter increased to £_000 ( price confirmed in text ) when it was identified that the gazebo needed concreting into the ground .
2	however , this rose to £_000 on the day .
2	i challenged the fitter on this and he mumbled something about some other item purchased but which he had no receipt for .
2	this price was not including the £_00 cost of sand and cement that i had to provide .
2	beware of fitting costs when buying one of these products as it bumps up the price of your purchase .
2	if i had known cost of fitting initially , i would have had second_thoughts so be warned .
2	awaiting delivery , trying to be patient , have given one star but only to post opinion
2	if i '_m hitting an artistic " blank spot " i turn to the saa and paint for inspiration and guidance .
2	looking through a few issues soon gives me the urge to pick_up my brushes again and i '_m off .
2	when it comes to shopping for materials the saa and the internet are my first_port of call .
2	i can get everything i need from them and i don_'_t have to wait long as they are so fast !
2	i have tried both the saa brushes and paints and , while both are excellent , they also have other brands to choose from .
2	i love being a member , long may they go on !
2	buyer_beware .
2	this company didnt confirm my booking until after i traveled even after numerous_emails to request the details .
2	i ended_up having to pay another firm to get a car and when i requested a full_refund from this company due to their efficiencies they said no .
2	customer service was terrible and appallling .
2	i have no idea how companies like this stay in business .
2	helpful & informative sales advise
2	i ordered the georgia parka & it was despatched & delivered quickly .
2	the parka was true to size but i found the coat was thinner_than_expected .
2	i always feel the cold & need a warmer coat .
2	also i really hated the faux_fur hood trimming .
2	contacted customer service & their speedy reply was helpful & informative .
2	i would definitely recommend target_dry .
2	absolutely 0st_class customer service , unbelievably quick , from sending prepaid_envelope , to acknowledging_receipt of fone , then payment . would def recommend mazuma
2	boiler_juice quote could not be_beaten on the day by three different suppliers .
2	ordered ok but had problems with payment authorisation so had to phone them .... is this a regular problem as it mentions it on the payment page ?
2	delivery was very quick , two_days ahead of date given which was great .
2	only_thing i didn_'_t like was i paid for 000_litres but they could only get 000 in .
2	money was not refunded to my card but went into " tank account " and i then had to go into this and ask for a transfer back to my card .
2	i think they should have it the other way round and that unless you specifically ask for it to go into a tank account , it goes back on your card .
2	otherwise couldn_'_t fault them at all .
2	i booked a dinner / theatre trip as a special outing for myself and three friends through lastminute . com .
2	the package was £_00 and it said tickets were up to £_00 face value and we would get the best available seats within their allocation so we thought great .
2	dinner was fine but when we got to the theatre the seats were dreadful and we were so high up the only way we could see the stage was by leaning right forward for the whole of the performance !
2	we went to the box office and asked if we could change seats as there were plenty of empty seats elsewhere but they said no , we had to stay where we were .
2	we talked to other people who had done the same as us , they were all very disappointed .
2	we also found that we could have put the same deal together ourselves by going direct to the theatre and would have got much_better seats for less money .
2	complained to lastminute . com who said they were seats with a good view - only with binnoculars and if you are a contortionist !
2	they offered a £_00 voucher_towards another event ......... i don_'_t think so .
2	won_'_t use lastminute . com ever again .
2	good car good service great value just great !
2	this is the best signal in most areas in paignton tried the other_networks but this is by far the best
2	i paid and ordered eyesential in october_0000 still reciving emails saying it will be with me in 0 - 00 days i have asked for a refund of the £_00 that was paid in good faith they are totaly criminal i am contacting_trading_standards on monday 00 jan
2	i had a problem with my fridge_freezer the freezer stopped_working on the friday .

2	was then told they dont give refunds and had to have credit_note what a load of rubbish i do not need to buy anything from this shop again .
2	good quality , lots of choice and very reasonabley_priced .
2	fast delivery
2	we have a small summerhouse and we were looking for a small , repro piece of storage furniture that looked pleasantly aged .
2	the bourbon sideboard just fits the bill .
2	looks well used .
2	it is well made .
2	provides all the storage i need and a surface to display collectables .
2	we are delighted with it .
2	i would order something_similar with confidence .
2	i have only ever placed two orders .
2	you were recommended by a somelier when i was telling him that i could not trace saffron gin .
2	i have been delighted with both of my orders .
2	postage is reasonable and your prices as competative .
2	i will purchase again .
2	over the years purchased many things from oka .
2	they are expensive but i like their designs albeit finishing on some furniture has_been disapointing .
2	in the past things have arrived damaged but have always been replaced without_question .
2	excellent communication , very professional , would use again .
2	contacted prior to collection as well as drop_off .
2	impressed , thankyou
2	very easy website , fast ordering , great communication on confirming order and despatch and very fast delivery .
2	would definitely use again !
2	i was connected to emma today who offered me a swift answer to my questions and was professional and friendly at all times .
2	i love the styles of fitflop , they are attractive and oh , so comfortable .
2	easy to buy with free_returns so your purchase cannot go_wrong .
2	my daughter was delighted with the flowers and the bear
2	cross pens are in my opinion some of the best pens etc .
2	around .
2	i have a solid gold cross pen bought many_years_ago and has_been in use constantly since purchased .
2	hence the reason for purchasing this pen for a very special present and the recipient is highly delighted
2	this website is and excellent site if your are searching for clothing , shoes etc .
2	clothing can vary in size and sometimes tend to be on the small size and i '_ve found the shoes etc aren_'_t usually presented in half sizes which is a shame for us ladies who are definitely a 0 . 0 and not a 0 or 0 , but in general the value is amazing
2	this website provided all the information i need to search easily on the item i was looking for , and was cheaper_than other website that were advertising the same bikini_top make that i was looking for
2	i was really delighted with the service from mytub .
2	i ordered some very fragile items .
2	called customer_services about them and how to arrange pick_up .
2	all sorted , was able to collect from a shop only a couple of miles_away .
2	the communication every_step of the way was brilliant .
2	i would certainly recommend using this firm , 00 / 00 .
2	quick and easy transaction , plenty of product choice as well as product info so you can compare items .
2	item arrived much_quicker_than_expected .
2	i was very wary of ordering from an online store i did not know .... you know ... rip_off stuff etc .
2	well i was very pleased with my glasses , they are exactly_what i wanted and are genuine goods .
2	the service was fast , communication was superb and delivery was so fast .
2	would recomment to anyone and i will be back
2	fast and efficient , my aran british wool jumpers are just what i needed on the farm , they have been hard_wearing and good quality at a very reasonable_price .
2	i will be back for more in the very near_future .
2	i knit myself and could not make them myself for the same price .
2	i found this very difficult to give to one of my cats .
2	the paste went everywhere but in the mouth !
2	she clearly hated the taste and was just not having it anywhere_near her .
2	my other cat was much_easier as i mixed the paste in with his traets and he ate them all up , no problem .
2	still not sure if it has worked though .
2	the one that hated it is still really thin and is off her food , this is now 0_days_later , not sure how long it takes to be effective but i think i should take her to the vets as it may even be something_else .
2	very prompt delivery , even_though its free !
2	i ordered , on 00 / 0 / 00 a kingsize_bed which was supposed to be in stock as it was under clearance and 0 bedside_tables .
2	they emailed to say the bed would be delivered on the 0th_august .
2	it did arrive , but they had sent 0 top parts , the reason i knew this was because the bottom part should have had a draw - no drawer present .
2	we told the driver immediately but all he said was phone the company .
2	my husband spent the next 0_days trying to actually speak to anyone from that company .
2	eventually he got through and was told the bed had been put on order and will be with us in due course , no_indication of when .
2	meanwhile we have no bed to sleep on as we got rid of our old bed !
2	several days_later we were told that the bed will be with us on 00th_august .
2	it didnt arrive .
2	when we rang to find out why we were told that it was delivered but no - one was in which is an outright lie - we were in all day practically sitting by the window waiting as it was that important to us !
2	they then emailed a new delivery date of the 00th - guess_what - it didnt turn_up !
2	reason ?
2	the van broke_down - yeah_right .
2	this company lies through there teeth .
2	the next delivery day was for today - 00th - low and behold a van pulled up and it was them !
2	hurray we thought , but all we got was the bed side_tables , still nothing to sleep on .
2	today we thought enough is enough and contacted trading standars and they told us that we have to email them and ask when they will be delivering the bed to give them one last chance and if it isnt forth_coming only then can we ask to get our money back - i '_m just thinking , all this just to get our money back .
2	i really want the bed and some sort of compensation for all the hassle and money lost through days of work and no decent nights_sleep .
2	it is not right that a company like this can get away with what they do when all they have to do at the end of it if someone takes the trouble to go to cab or trading_standards is there money back - your just back where you started then , with no bed !
2	there has to be a way to stop people like this .
2	they are actually making me ill with all this , in fact just sitting here typing thisiis making my blood boil !
2	all i can do is try to spread the word and try to warn_others to avoid this co . like the plague !
2	i also found that they had traded on ebay but are no_longer registered due to tons on negative_feedback .
2	i wish i '_d done my homework before hand or i would never have ordered from them .
2	allin all this bed has turned_out to be massively expensive in more ways than one !
2	a really helpful and informative website that does exactly_what it promises .
2	the software arrived quickly and was very good value for money .
2	ecosoftware '_s website was very clear and easy to use .
2	i used shiply to organise transportation of a new_puppy from slovakia to shropshire .
2	i was so concerned_about this long journey .
2	but , i shouldn_'_t have worried .
2	the feed_back of quotations came quickly .
2	my courier was second to non .
2	he advised me on all the paperwork requirements needed and kept in touch with me throughout the journey .
2	my gorgeous puppy arrived safe and sound and showed no stress whatsover .
2	i will_definately use this service again .
2	cheryl thomas
2	i have used hellocanvas a few_times_now , are they are the best canvas company around !
2	the website is so simple to use , the quality of prints and super_fast delivery make their service second to none !
2	will_definately recommend to friends and family
2	i had to make a special cake for my son '_s 00th_birthday .
2	gone were the days of themed cakes .
2	what to make ?
2	- he_loves fruit and chocolate .
2	how to present the fruit on the cake ?
2	- keep it on top with chocolate tubes around the side .
2	having never seen them for sale in shops a quick google_search came up with the chocolate_trading company .
2	yippee ....... oh goodness will they melt before getting here ????
2	nope - the packaging they came in was enviromentaly friendly and kept out the scorching 00 deg heat we are having .
2	now all i have to do is make the cake and transport it successfully .
2	easy hopefully .
2	big thanks to the chocolate_trading company .
2	totally professional service with no question left unanswered .
2	ref .

2	i ordered shoes in the afternoon and they were delivered following_morning .
2	super service and friendly operators
2	ordered 0 pairs of glasses for myself and two others .
2	no_problems with the 0 different_prescriptions .
2	all reading_glasses and are used as ' spare pairs '.
2	i think the old saying ' you get what you pay for ' is spot_on - would not like to use as my main glasses as the frames are slightly cheap looking - but great value and will definitely use again .
2	have recommended to so many people already - and will_continue to do so .
2	i will make this as brief as i can .
2	my husband bought me a bag as one of my christmas_presents .
2	i didn_'_t like it so we took it back for a refund .
2	we had the receipt .
2	now it get '_s interesting .
2	we were within the their time limit for refunds but at the till we were told and i quote " sorry can '_t refund you on this bag because you haven_'_t got the 0 receipts .
2	i had the customer copy and she wanted the other one as well .
2	obviously my husband mislaid it because he only gave_me the one .
2	onlookers must have been loving the embarrassment i felt .
2	everything you could have wanted was on the till receipt .
2	i stood my ground and wouldn_'_t budge , i worked in retail for a very short time and i have seen what customers do !!
2	reluctantly she looked across at a dour looking female in another queue who nodded and replied " yes that '_s right we don_'_t refund on the one receipt ".
2	i was quite cross by now .
2	i replied in that case i will have a gift voucher .......... well !!
2	at this point she seemed at a loss that i dared make this request , until she made eye contact with the dour , scruffy female in the other queue ( this person obviously worked there ) who nodded her assent .
2	i was then told in a loud voice " as you have this receipt i can see you have bought the bag , so i will give you the gift voucher ".
2	when i asked if i could use it online of course the answer is no !!
2	confirmed of course by the aforementioned female .
2	never again will i ever use monsoon !!
2	utter and complete_shambles of a company .
2	oh !!
2	and the bag was horrible it was cheap and smelly and it wasn_'_t cheap either !
2	!
2	it has_been my misfortune to have recently had dealings with this company .
2	in the past my experience with this company has_been positive .
2	but this was about to change .
2	i ordered a couple of items of clothing .
2	i changed my mind after a few_days and rang to cancel the order .
2	unfortunately i was about three hours too late the items were about to be dispatched .
2	the advice i was given was to refuse the package which would then be immediately returned to laura_ashley then i would be refunded .
2	that was three_weeks_ago .
2	i made a call last_week to be told , yes , the goods had been received back and that i would receive my refund in due course !!
2	satisfied that the goods were there i just waited .
2	a week_later i ring again , just a while ago .
2	spoke to an extremely smug , unhelpful female who should not be working with the public as her attitude was surly and obstructive .
2	this female customer service person then went on to tell me and i quote " no we have record of receiving the goods back ".
2	she blamed the courier company for holding on to them , said there was nothing she could do but did i want to speak to someone_else in another department who was also customer service but that there were 0 people in the queue .
2	when i replied that it was costing me money she made no comment .
2	an_email was suggested but then she advised me that she wouldn_'_t pick it up till monday .
2	eventually i did speak with a very polished young_lady_who was very on the ball who immediately apologised_profusely for her colleague .
2	took my details , looked at the screen and saw that it was in the depot awaiting the next step for refunding .
2	she contacted the depot to put a priority on this return .
2	a sad experience this time round .
2	i will not be in a hurry to deal with this company again unless they prioritise their customer service personnel and their whole refunding system .
2	communication brilliant , goods as_described , very quick delivery , packaging again extremely good , couldn_'_t fault this company and this is the first time i have used them ....... i will be back !
2	i requested a by 00_noon delivery as i had an_appointment that p . m .
2	the mattress came by carrier at 00 a . m . at 00 : 00 i contacted customer service to enquire where the bed_base was .
2	they got on to the couriers who then phoned me to say the bed_base would be there within the hour .
2	so it was .
2	the driver for both deliveries were very pleasant and happy to deliver .
2	i was one happy person to get everything on the day as promised .
2	went to my appointment with a smile on my face .
2	was amazed , particulary at this time of year , how quickly my order was received .
2	good product , dogs very pleased .
2	phoned up , asked if my details were still on their system .
2	answer was yes .
2	was put on hold for 0 minutes .
2	was told that the last address would be where the new tyre would be put on .
2	said i had a discount_code .
2	harassed customer service person was rushing me .
2	got my discount .
2	turns_out that it wasn_'_t the last address where the replacement would be done , it was the other address and i wasn_'_t there .
2	phoned the tyre replacement technician who had kept in touch throughout .
2	worked it out between us that i would get the tyre done at my home address ( which the call_centre said i was out of the postcode zone ).
2	more time is needed at the call_centre for the customer '_s preferences to be given priority .
2	fast delivery , very good quality goods , returns for larger_size excellent , then fast delivery again .
2	what more can you ask for ?
2	oh , by the way , the prices are really good too .
2	this service was excellent my parcel was collected on tuesday_morning and delivered on wednesday_afternoon to houston texas .
2	it was cheaper_than any other method i have tried and much_quicker .
2	will_definately be using them again
2	first_class servis first_class product will certainly be spending my penny '_s with them next time i am buying a fragrance
2	i have used animed for a few_years_now , to purchase medications / supplements for my dog leo , ordering on line is easy and delivery exceptional - i never have to worry - many_thanks animed
2	ordered placed and paid for 00 august , 0_weeks_later still no delivery , several emails later i am told that once a parcel has left them its in the hands of the royal_mail - no offer of refund but will replace , and take no responsibility if goes astray .
2	i will never use nombox again , and even now not sure i will see my items .
2	i am writing about tesco westwood store , scarborough . i used to shop there regularly , spending about 000 - 000_pounds weekly . accessing the store on foot is a nightmare , you have to walk round the entire outside of the store , the main doors are round the back . i returned a blind i had bought to customer_services , the woman was so horrible , and you would have thought that she was refunding me from her own pocket . there was some fittings missing , but she talked down to me , and i was offended . another time i was in store choosing easter_eggs for 00 people , so was spending a bit of time in that aisle . an assistant was re - stocking with a large trolley in the centre of the aisle . she was looking very stressed , and was obviously displeased with me looking at the display with my trolley . she was only doing her job , but it was her face , as though i was in the way . i went elsewhere . the next incident was awful . i was in the store with 0 children , and an assistant was stocking the biscuit aisle . there was a packet of broken biscuits on a shelf , and my little_girl picked_up a broken piece and ate it . well , the assistant went to town on me , saying she could call the police , it was theft , and was so wrong . i was so upset , i wsa actually buying mobile_phones and the weekly_shop , and i put everything back and left the store crying , and shouting at my little_girl . i have never , ever , been in there again , or shopped at tesco in any other way . also , at that store , if you need to call a taxi , you have to wait outside on the ramp in all_weathers . they are taking over our town too , it will be the final nail in the coffin for scarborough , i can tell you .
2	i came about this site by_chance and was very glad i did . i found everything i wanted and the prices were very good .
2	the site was easy to use and the items were delivered very quickly with no_problems . would definately use again and would recommed to anyone .
2	i have ordered silk flowers many_times from gt_decorations and find them very good value for money and very pretty .

2	this is the first time i have used viovet and it will not be the last .
2	i was surprised at the wide_range of products available .
2	all the goods i ordered arrived within_00hrs .
2	i was kept_informed_throughout , from order to expected delivery , until delivery .
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending viovet to anyone .
2	i like this site so much because it rewards us depositors .
2	there are loads of jackpots to win every day and the rooms have nice hosts and nice players to chat to .
2	i like their easy to win extra chat_games too .
2	the actual site was really easy to naviagte my way around and their room selector is quick and easy , no waiting for pages to load lik eon some sites .
2	i have told my friends all about it too as i get a refer a friend bonus .
2	keep_up the good work .
2	i really had fun on this site playing_bingo .
2	i saw all these people popping up as they won and didn_'_t realise that the chat host was live sitting there talking to everyone and me , it was so instant and fun .
2	they played games with the players and i saw people doing crazy stuff and getting free money for it .
2	i didn_'_t try that time but i will next time as i see they have events every week .
2	there seems to be a lot of jackpots won on this site too , they are going off all the time . i will investigate those a bit more and see if they have a facbook page .
2	i suggest everyone gives it a go as i played for ages with me free £ 0 they gave_me to try it .
2	i was a little_sceptical but i tried exante and i lost_weight and for once i found it easy to stick to and i lost_weight .
2	will carry on !
2	i hired a convertible and got given a brand_new mustang .
2	car was great and so was the service from both offices , i collected in port canaveral and droped off in sanford , really easy drop_off and no queues .
2	i will use alamo again .
2	graham has given us some really good advice about which upright piano to buy .
2	what he didn_'_t do was try to persuade us to get something really expensive .
2	we can also spread payments interest free .
2	definitely buying from uk_pianos as soon as we move into our new house .
2	i recently_purchased a tyros 0 with a number of accessories and dealt_with dave stuart by email and phone .
2	dave was very helpful in refining and revising my quotation , as based_upon availability and his advice i altered the accessories i wished to purchase and he was prompt in replying to my queries .
2	as i was spending upwards of £ 0 , 000 i shopped_around before placing an order and found gear0music most competitive .
2	last , but not least , the packages arrived on the date promised by dave and in immaculate_condition .
2	i will certainly continue to shop at gear0music .
2	i would not use this website again .
2	i wanted tickets for prince igor at the london coliseum and somehow got onto this website instead of the official coliseum website .
2	this cost me dearly .
2	the tickets cost £_00 more on this website than the official website for no advantage whatsoever .
2	and of course i am unable to cancel them .
2	also note that when you purchase tickets on this website they do not disclose the face value of the purchased tickets .
2	this has to be for a reason !
2	didn_'_t deliver my items .
2	no response or explaination .
2	ignored my emails .
2	no customer service .
2	had to cancel payment myself as they where just going to keep it .
2	very very disappointing .
2	use a reputable_company , not play . com !
2	p0g might be cheap but please do not use them .
2	check their no compensation items list and prohibited items list .
2	these cover every item known to man , which then covers them for never paying any compensation out , even when they are proven to be at fault .
2	they will still take payment and allow you to take out extra insurance for your precious items but never tell you they are not actualy covered , untill you try to make a claim .
2	i have now had 0 expensive items smashed by them and these were not fragile items but they still managed to smash them and of course the scam comes into place and no compensation .
2	they don_'_t actualy employ proper drivers with vans , any old herbet turns_up in their old banger , no wonder everything gets broke or ' lost '.
2	so pay a bit extra and employ a proper delivery firm .
2	be warned .
2	flowers were delivered on time and as_described .
2	sehr_zufrieden
2	it is too early to say anything about the products yet as i haven_'_t taken them long enough .
2	but so far very confidence inspiring .
2	what more can i say , the recipient was delighted .
2	appear really honest and straight_forward .
2	would recommend you give them a call .
2	yum_yum , what better_than to finish your meal with an ice_cold baileys in a chocolate shot !
2	00 chocolate shots for £_00 . 00 a fantastic bargain !
2	fanfastic products at a competitive price with exceptional service
2	i ordered a printer from you as always , dominic called me to advise me that there was a better printer for the same cost .
2	my customer was over the moon as he received a much_better printer for the same cost .
2	brilliant as always
2	i ordered this as a present for my sons_girlfriend , the price was amazing for the size of bottle and it was delivered with a couple of days .
2	also it came with a voucher off some wine so who could ask for more !
2	!
2	very happy !
2	!
2	all i did was scroll_down to the dog_food my puppy eats and there it was .
2	a couple of details and two_days_later the courrier knocks on my door with the food .
2	a brilliant service
2	absolutely excellent service and perfect tuxedo !!!!!!!

2	easy to navigate website , good value and fast delivery !
2	i ordered a dress on october 00th , it still has not arrived !

2	i have queried my order 0 times by email , every time i get a standard reply apologizing to all_sorts of possible complaints but not actually to me .
2	they may sound cheap but if they take your money , hold on to it for a few month and never send the goods , it is very expensive !
2	i will avoid them in future and post this review on other_sites !
2	i ordered a steam_mop through kgb , when the mop never arrived , i wrote to kgb numerous_emails asking for a refund , they did not even answer . if you want to use these sites stick to groupon , i had a similar problem with one of their deals and they refunded me without_any_problems ! i have now referred the case to my credit_card provider .
2	...

2	would recommend to anyone .
2	i placed an order for egg_whites and no calorie sauces .
2	due to an issue with the courier company the box got damaged and many of the egg white containers and bottled sauces burst_open meaning the whole delivery was spoiled and had to throw it away .
2	i phoned musclefood who arranged for the order to be resent immediately at no extra_cost .
2	excellent service and i will_continue to buy from musclefood .

2	nice shopkeepers to take parcels in for much longer hours than the p o

2	bought two pasta dishes to take to my holiday home for a quick arrival meal .
2	the smell when cooking meatballs with pasta was reminiscent of rotten cat_food .
2	my husband found bone chips grissle and fatty lumps in the meatballs . totally inedible .
2	we also bought a spaghetti_bolognese it also had bones in the sauce .
2	i contacted tesco via_facebook asked them to chase their suppliers .
2	in a situation like this their_rivals would reimburse or offer a goodwill voucher ,
2	they wrote a meaningless reply to get_rid of the enquiry
2	i will use ocado sainsbury and waitrose in future
2	morrisons are streets_ahead on quality
2	the only good point in my area is that they have a pay at pump service station and the staff are generally nice polite people
2	hermes have alsorts of tracking_information that is totally_untrue and waste your time waiting in for the non arriving parcel
2	if by some miracle an item does turn_up they will throw it into the back garden or leave it by a rear door and leave no card
2	you are unable to contact them as a recipient and have to make endless calls to suppliers to sort things out
2	i actively avoid suppliers now who use hermes which is a shame as this includes companies such as house of fraser
2	they left a package containing a £_000 coat in a wet cardboard package at the back door at christmas time
2	make the post_office look like a fabulous service
2	if i am unfortunate_enough to have to contact them i use the new business form as there is a slight chance they may read it unlike any customer service enquiry
2	purchased two_pairs of rayban_sunglasses and paid the lowest_price on the web .
2	very helpful seller , sent the glasses immediately and obviously brand_new original glasses in original unopened box .
2	would recommend and will use again .
2	this is the best online shop i have found for purchasing a wide_variety of whiskys and other drinks that you just would not find in a local shop .

2	i have ordered from cult_pens many_times_now and their service is quick and reliable .
2	their prices are some of the best i '_ve found anywhere , and their selection is absolutely the best .
2	cult_pens is the first place i go to when looking for anything to do with pens or pencils !
2	opinion says it all .

2	when i enquired , i was told some products were missing .
2	i then asked them to wait_until all products were in .
2	they said ok but they went_ahead and sent what they had .
2	i thought they had gathered them all .
2	when i receivedthem , one was missing and i was not believed at first that i was telling the truth .
2	will definitely not buy again .
2	this is the first time i have used the currency_club and i am very pleased i did .
2	cash arrived next_day and nice brand_new notes sent , not old manky ones like some exchange places .
2	top_marks !
2	i love shopping at viovet , the prices are very good and so are the delivery charges .
2	the range of products is immense too compared to other online pet suppliers .

2	great service , arranged to sell phone online , used my own packaging and their label , sent it special delivery and received payment the next_day .
2	note : it cost me £ 0 for special delivery but the post_office informed me that if i hadn_'_t and it had gone_missing i would not receive compensation for it even if the value was under_£_00 as it was a mobile phone .
2	amazing service .
2	made a mistake on our original order and left someone '_s name off a list on the back of the tshirt .
2	very friendly helpful staff when i rang .
2	returned the tshirt to add the missing name and it was returned in double quick time with no extra_charge .
2	one very happy daughter !!
2	good quality tshirt too , and the printing is excellent too .
2	i buy from petmeds as they are quick on delivery and have many items i need for my cat .
2	the prices are copetitive and customer service is very helpful .
2	any_problems they let you know ie if its going to be a bit late because of stock .
2	plus it sends an text when its on its way .
2	totally satified .
2	great web_site , curtious and helpful .
2	quick and easy ordering , first_class delivery .
2	got a jumbo acoustic really good value excellent sound , well pleased all_round , will be back .

2	will recommed to all .
2	great prices and choice .
2	you will be met on time , provided with quality transport , given local historical information whilst the driver takes care to drive in a manner that addresses your travelling concerns .
2	when you want to buy things on ebay that won_'_t fit into your car , this is great .
2	it also makes it easier to recycle furniture etc very ecologically sound .
2	i purchased some ray - ban wayfarer model sunglasses , very trendy , latest special series and i would recommend my friends in portugal from facebook , if you like ray - ban_sunglasses , and i '_m_sure everybody does , to buy them from this seller .
2	it '_s cheaper_than here and very reasonable shipping_charges .
2	great deal !
2	happy with the product & fairly prompt delivery .
2	found equivalent replacement pump to the one supplied with my fountain several_years_ago which gave up the ghost recently . site made it easy to see if my choice was suitable and the specification detail was right on the button , arrived very promptly , would recommend to anyone .
2	can only confirm all the good things said by others .
2	best service of all i had contacted .
2	speediest service in all_respects .
2	best monthly income .

2	could not recommend any higher .
2	go with age .
2	i have made several purchases with amazon from printer_cartridges to board games etc .
2	i have never had any bad_experiences with them at all .
2	the services and deliveries are always spot_on .
2	i would reccommend them to all my friends and family , you can '_t get better_than that .
2	i '_m happy with my orson armchair and percy dining_chairs .
2	the latter i get to sit on , the former has_been usurped by everyone else !
2	sturdy , comfortable furniture with a stylish edge .
2	just what i was looking for .
2	i always buy from shoe zone as the quality and price are so good .
2	the shoes are comfy and when i use the shops the staff are friendly and helpful .

2	great to deal with , i recommend to anyone .
2	website easy to navigate and the guinot products i ordered were priced very competitively .
2	despite the christmas_period the goods arrived arrived within 0 week .
2	great day when i found " temptation " on the internet ...... they have great stylish products and go that extra_mile to make each shopping_experience a wonderful treat ...... can '_t wait for the next time i go searching at " temptation_gifts . com "
2	ordered tickets from this website even_though i had found them £ 0 cheaper elsewhere , but i wanted to pay with paypal and this website offered this service .
2	wish i had waited the very next_day they had a flash_sale that would have saved me £_00 . 00 .
2	i understand that they had no_obligation to advise me if i waited 00_hours i could have taken_advantage of the sale , but it would have been good customer_relations .
2	beware if you buy tickets from this company as they may be cheaper 00_hours_later .
2	used this company several_times_now for whey_protein and bcaa .
2	prices are reasonable and delivery with standard delivery is usually 0_days .
2	the mp max elle tastes nice and mixes well the only product i haven_'_t liked is their mini bottles which leak when you shake them .
2	this is a warning to anyone_thinking of using this letting_agency .
2	be warned that no matter what condition you leave the property in they will not return your deposit .
2	this is not only my experience but that of many other dissatisfied learmont customers that i have spoken to .
2	please if you find yourself in the unfortunate position to be already dealing_with this company , take pics of everything , do not accept any thing verbally , get yourself a good lawyer , dont expect your deposit back and do not expect any kind of customer service .
2	there are many letting agencies so please find yourself one with good reviews and avoid this company like the plague .
2	absolutely usless and i would never use them again .
2	communication was non - existent .
2	i had to actually phone them and asked where my order was , only to be told the product was now discontinued .
2	apparently i had been emailed ... i '_m still_waiting !!
2	this also happened to my partner with a different order !
2	!
2	not at all happy and not the way to treat customers !
2	good service
2	would order from them again
2	i would tell everyone about them already told most of my friends .
2	this company is very good they help where ever they can .
2	i '_ve been with very about 0 or 0 years and i order very regularly - at_least once a week .
2	i have never had an issue with them .
2	items always arrive earlier_than_expected , even when i order the previous day .
2	i usually get told at checkout that the items will be with me the day after the following_day and yet always arrive next_day .
2	i use the collect_+ service frequently as the parcels arrive there by 0 . 00am if i '_m in desperate_need for the items and also use yodel a lot .
2	in fact the man from yodel asked if my computer was broken as he hadn_'_t delivered anything lately !
2	that '_s when i was doing more at collect_+.
2	never had an issue with customer service and always felt like i was talking to someone in the uk .
2	mind you , i don_'_t think i '_ve had to contact them much .
2	i would highly_recommend using this company .
2	best company i '_ve ever dealt_with and they have the most amazing designer_clothes !
2	cannot_beat their service .
2	everything is despatched very quickly and always_arrives safely and well_packaged to my door .
2	faultless !
2	i '_ve ordered three_times from here recently and each time has_been a very easy and pleasant_experience .
2	the items have turned_up within a couple of days , are beautifully_packaged and have the added extra of an argento / thomas_sabo bag so that they can still be given as a gift .
2	i have ordered for myself but love this added extra .
2	all in all a great shopping_experience and i will definitely be buying from again !
2	i '_ve_used mazuma a few_times and am so impressed with the service .
2	i post one day and the very next_day the money is in my account .
2	such incredibly fast service .
2	extremely highly_recommended .
2	would never use another site again .
2	i have ordered from new look multiple_times and they never disapoint .

2	play . com never_fail to please me , i have orderd from them many_times and every item has_been outstanding and good value also free delivery is a great bonus , i would definatly recommend this site to anyone .
2	i have been waiting 0_days and so far have recieved nothing .
2	i do not live in a remote_area and have not been contacted about any_problems with the order so do not see why it is taking so long .
2	at this point i just hope something is going to arrive soon .
2	why not give gjwtitmuss a butchers ?.. i have found them cheapest online if you multibuy .. ie buy 0 products at a time , and free delivery also !
2	swift and efficient service
2	if you are looking for good value for yourself or as a gift you can not beat cheapsmells .
2	i have used them for a number of years and found the service excellent .
2	0_* - very fast and do what they said .
2	i bought perfume from click_fragrance for the birthday of a friend of mine .
2	the price was about 00_% of what i would have had to pay in a high_street store and it was delivered speedily and well_packed as promised .
2	i couldn_'_t ask for more .
2	can '_t complain_about the price of the arran jumper i bought for my husband , but the website said that it was 000_% wool and the label in the jumper says 00_% wool 00_% nylon .
2	woolovers tell me that this is why it was a ' second ' but that '_s not what the website says !
2	makes me wonder what the fabric content actually is ?
2	this is one of the most efficient and friendly companies i have ever had the pleasure to deal with .
2	highly_recommend them .
2	susan surgeoner
2	brought a bushcraft training knife .

2	dawn holmes
2	we picked the car up at rome ( fum ) airport , it was exactly_what we asked for and it was a swift process from_start to finish .
2	t . holmes
2	i have used trophystore before because they never_fail to deliver .

2	it does what it says on the tin , very well .
2	i would certainly use this company again , very speedy delivery .

2	good communication from serenata so i knew the flowers were out to be delivered and great to get an_email to say they had been delivered .
2	the flowers were exactly as shown in the picture .
2	only problem was there was a website problem and it took me 00_minutes to get the order to process .
2	all good apart_from that !
2	having tried every slimming club , wacky diet and several vlcd '_s before , i know that vlcd '_s are the only ones that work for me .
2	i successfully lost_weight last_year , but regained it , plus a stone , after having to have a break due to an operation .
2	i knew i had to go back to a diet , but couldn_'_t face the thought of the same boring , limited flavours of shakes .
2	dieting in winter isn_'_t fun when you are surviving on milkshakes alone !
2	i researched every vlcd diet and thought ' if it '_s good enough for linda nolan , it '_s good enough for me '!
2	the difference with boossh is the variety .
2	there is so much choice and something for everyone .
2	i love the fact that i can drink it , slurp it or eat it !
2	the flavours are very authentic and even those i thought i might not enjoy are now my favourites ie mandarin shake !
2	there are so many ways to boossh and i can have a meal with my family in the evening , so i '_m not feeling ' left out ; socially .
2	the most_important_thing as someone_who has probably lost and regained my own body weight many_times , is that boossh is teaching me about portion_control too .
2	i don_'_t feel deprived as , being a real carnivore , i can still eat meat and veg every day .
2	the choc bars are so yummy that this doesn_'_t feel like a diet at all !
2	i also missed fruit on other_vlcd '_s , but i can have that too on this diet !
2	the boossh page on facebook is great for chatting to others that are boosshing and i '_ve made new friends too .
2	reading about other people '_s weight_loss is so inspiring and motivating and everyone is so happy to share tips and advice .
2	i always felt so alone on other_vlcd '_s .
2	i knew by the end of my first day that i wanted to stick with boossh and could never go back to any other_vlcd , although i know i won_'_t need to !.
2	i lost_00lb in 00 days and it has_been easy !
2	so impressed with the products and my weight_loss , i signed_up as a distributor as there wasn_'_t anyone covering my area .
2	i started 00 clients on boossh in my first month and every one of them is losing_weight .
2	it '_s fun dieting with my growing team of boosshers and i '_m loving helping others too .
2	i never thought that needing to lose_weight would lead me to a new job !
2	best airport transfer very clean vehicle on time , and very reasonable
2	they are extremely_helpful & very pleasant on the phone if you have a query .
2	i would recommend pet_supermarket to anyone , i have told all my friends who are also very glad i told them .
2	i am a very savvy shopper always comparing where can i get the best prices as well quality and to have a place that has no minimum_spend to get free_p_+_p is great and very fast delivery is a plus .
2	you will be back to spend with them again & again as i am .
2	i do have a lot of pets both furry ones & reptiles so thank_you pet_supermarket :-))
2	i '_m already starting to choose what i want next , it '_s amazing the quality & price .
2	i shall be buying . from here all the time from now on .
2	i . will be going into . town to smell some new scents which i have not tried and sample them ,. then on here to buy them .
2	however , if you know which one you want like i did before my selection last time , great .
2	i was looking for that particular perfume which i had from here for a long time unsuccessfully , i started to think they '_d finished making that particular burberry , so you can_imagine the delight when i . saw it on here :-)).
2	i '_d kept my old empty bottle for years looking for the same one .
2	so many thanx to cheapsmells not only did i get my edp i wanted , it was an excellent price too .
2	i will be a regular customer , also could not fault the p_&_p , was very carefully_packaged too and arrived in no time .
2	this company is very effiecient goods arrived in 0_days they texted me to let_me know what time the driver was delivery also they told me his name .
2	once again well_done always on time , woke_up to snow will my hob arrive yes it did .
2	i have used this company 0 times before and always items arrive on time .
2	this the second time i have ordered food and tablets and each time it has arrived in a few_days and at the time they imformed me
2	very easy transaction right part , great price and very quick delivery
2	from the very start this company was a pleasure to deal with i ordered the worktops and set the delivery day they sent a email to confirm .
2	on the day they arrived at the time they said , the quality of the tops are excellent .
2	a very smooth_transaction
2	years_ago we saved hard to book a trip to an area in spain described as a ' former fishing village ' within part of the description .
2	it sounded charming and having never been to the mainland before the travel_agents blurb was our only guide .
2	on arrival it was awful , former was the clue .
2	it was no_longer a fishing village , just a highly commercial area .
2	since then trip_adviser has_been created and it '_s a godsend .
2	you can check the travel_agent '_s blurb with the opinions of real people and make an informed_decision .
2	this is so much_better .
2	it '_s also great that i can add my own reviews to help inform other_travellers .
2	a brilliant concept , long may it be with us !
2	i '_ve_used pet_supermarket for several_years_now , favouring them over some other_suppliers who offered poor customer service .
2	with pet_supermarket any_queries i have had have been dealt_with appropriately .
2	the products are good quality and affordable .
2	the speed of delivery is impressive , i can cater for all my small pets_needs in one order and feel_confident that it will arrive promptly .
2	i decided to have a de - clutter session and looked on line for potential mobile phone purchasers .
2	mazuma_mobile were the best value for money , their process was so simple to follow and very quick .
2	before a week had passed i had received the pre_- paid envelopes , posted my old_phones , received emails from mazuma updating_me on progress and then telling_me my money was in my bank .
2	it was so quick and efficient , i highly_recommend them .
2	purchased with the money my son had saved up for best part of a year . so we wanted to make_sure he got value for money . we certainly did with pcspecialist . great product and great service thanks very much .
2	the products were the cheapest online and the delivery service was excellent .
2	i have to say that petshopbowl are the best company i have dealt_with for speed of delivery , superb value for money and whats more the customer service is excellent .
2	i would definitely recommend anyone to switch to this company .
2	loved the selection , and the price . why pay more for great frames ?
2	will use you after every eyetest !

2	recomended and great serbice from shoetique .
2	hi on day 0 and so far so good .
2	food is quite tasty albeit you can add a little_bit of chilli flakes to the soup .
2	dont feel_hungry at all .
2	hope to get good results and the end of the 00 days .
2	shakes are a bit boring but filling .
2	you can also make with water if you dont fancy the milk .
2	my fav is strawberry .
2	would love to try the muffins but they are not in stock .
2	would recomend giving this a a try .

2	i was so impressed with the service , it stated it was a quick service but could not believe it when it actually came so quick .
2	i had ordered another canvas from another company and it still had not arrived after 0_weeks and many emails , and my daughter needed it for her photography coursework .
2	so i toot a chance and ordered her another canvas from my - picture and it was here in a flash , they do exactly_what it says on the tin , as the saying goes , ready to ship in 00hrs .
2	well_done and thank_you .
2	wish everyone was as good as you .
2	i have used interparcel many things and have always been very happy with the service .
2	it is easy to get a quote , and work out which service is best to use .
2	they are always delivered very quickly .
2	would definitely recommend to anyone_wanting a fast and efficient courier service .
2	i ordered 0 leki walking_sticks on 00th_october and they arrived at 00 . 00hrs on the 00th_october .
2	it doesn_'_t come much_better_than that , exactly_what i wanted , free of delivery charge , in the quickest possible time .
2	parcel 0go the worst i have ever come_across , they dont deliver parcel and mark it down as delivered , when a fuss is made they then tell you no it was not delivered courier made a mistake .
2	you get appologised too and promised it that same day .
2	0_days on you still_havent got it and they wont answer your emails , live_chat dont help you and you have lost your parcel to the theiving gits .
2	climbing kilimanjaro is something that i '_d always wanted to do , but there was just no way that my husband was fit enough to do it .
2	so i took the bull by the horns and booked the trip as a birthday surprise , for his 00th , to motivate him from being a couch potato , dropping a few_pounds , and hopefully getting fit in the process .
2	cruel some may say , but it did the trick :-_d
2	after_reading the reviews about pe and chatting to rachel i was hooked and took the plunge .
2	it '_s now or never i thought .
2	this was a real challenge for both of us , but our guides , gaston and elias were fantastic .
2	we felt like we were in safe_hands all the way .
2	both of them were great fun to be with , elias had an incredibly cheeky smile and also a great sense of humour .
2	we both felt humbled by how hard the entire team worked .
2	our porters had the camp taken down after we left and then would spring past us on the trail and have it put up again before we arrived in the next camp .... incredible !
2	our cook , paul , whipped up some wonderful , tasty food on the mountain , which was much_appreciated .
2	in fact the portions were much too_big and i began to worry that we may put weight on while out there .... particularly when the nutella and pancakes came out ... yummy !
2	helpful tip - do book the toilet option !
2	the public toilets on kili are by far the worst i have ever come_across .
2	i won_'_t go into detail but just absolutely foul !
2	thank_you pe for a really memorable trip .
2	both myself and derek would not_hesitate to recommend you .
2	we ' re thinking of climbing island peak as our next adventure so will be back in touch .
2	i came_across this website by_chance , with not livling near shops it '_s handy for me , i have been using this company for a good few_months now , and i find them very good , i usually ask them to deliver on a day thats convient for me , and i ask ( e . g ) if they can be delivered say thursday , as monday , tuesday wednesday .
2	are not convenient , and they always do , i ordered an item of cat_food which was out of stock , and a very friendly lady rang to ask if i would consider another alternative , i said yes , it was cheaper_than the previous item .
2	and i got a refund for the difference , their food is also cheaper_than the super market , and it means as i don_'_t have a car i don_'_t have to carry it , yes i would highly reckomend this company to my friends and family .
2	the item arrived very quickly , for such a small tree , it makes up for it , by it '_s gorgerous colours , and different_settings , i love it , i would also certainly reckomend this company .
2	to anyone , an excellent service .
2	ordered frontline from petfleas , very easy wensite to use , cheaper_than_anywhere_else i found , very quick delivery thank_you jackie goodrick
2	i ordered a pair of specs i paid £_00 for the glasses i had thier bronze lense package which is free , i only ordered the cheap glasses as a spare as i have just paid £_000 for glasses from specsavers , i was a little_worried as i have never ordered from this company before , i was expecting them to be about 0 - 0_weeks before they arrived , 0_days after i ordered them they arrived , ( specsavers took 0_weeks from thier shop ) the glasses are amazing the lenses are lighter_than specsavers ( which i paid specsaver £_00 extra for the thin and light ) the glasses fitted almost perfectly just need a little tweak on the bridge which i did myself , needless to say i am so pleased with my specs they are my best pair my expencive ones are in the draw for spares , brilliant service i will never go_anywhere_else for my glasses again , thank_you direct sight .
2	first_class service , always delivered within a few_days of ordering .
2	the curtains were good quality and just as i '_d expected .
2	they arrived on time and without problems .
2	good service .
2	i have recently_purchased several items from medicanimal . com and have found them to be quick and efficient in despatching the goods ordered .
2	they are also reasonably_priced and i will make them my first choice when buying animal products .
2	my order was delivered in two parts - i received one part but not the second so i contacted petmeds who replied quickly and the second part of the delivery came the next_day .
2	very helpful .

2	i ordered a motor for our washing_machine in july_0000 .
2	the motor arrived within a few_days .
2	the engineer then realised that i needed to order a control modules as well , which i promptly did given the good service i had had from interspares thus_far .
2	the module never arrived , and after trying to speak to interspares '_s customer service department on the phone ( countless messages left ) and by email , and out of sheer frustration i went out and bought another washing_machine .
2	i continued trying to contact interspares to arrange the return of the motor and a refund but never go a reply .
2	their customer service extension is never manned , it seems , so i then tried choosing the sales extension , and that was when i spoke to a lady called [_name_removed_], who after_hearing my account instructed me to return the motor for a full_refund and said that the part that had not been delivered would also been refunded .
2	i posted the motor back to them on [_name_removed_] instruction and was expecting a refund .
2	several weeks went past and i eventually called my credit_card company to enquire if a refund had been received from interspares .
2	no refund had been received , so i once again started attempting to contact interspares .
2	i eventually spoke to [_name_removed_], who appears to be the big wig in the company .
2	he first said that they had not received the motor and that i was not acting in good faith .
2	i then managed to find the certificate of posting and called him back the following_day .
2	by then , he confirmed that the motor had been received but because it had been bolted on to the machine , but never used , they would not refund any money to me .
2	i tried to explain to [_name_removed_] that the part was only returned because i did not receive the module and that after waiting for about one month i felt that i had waited enough and went out and bought another machine .
2	simon said that their terms and conditions clearly_stated that parts that had been fitted but not used would not be refunded .
2	i checked their t & c and found nothing to that effect .
2	he also promised that a refund for the part that never arrived would be made .
2	after waiting for about one month , i contacted them again as i still had not received a refund and was told that it would be done there and then .
2	i have now received only a partial_refund because they saw fit to deduct the cost of returning the motor to them from the refund for the part that was never delivered .
2	so not only am i out of £_00 . 00 paid for the motor , but they also took over_£_00 . 00 from the refund that they did process .
2	i was instructed to use their freepost returns service which now they have charged me for .
2	i will file a claim in the small_claims court and report this company to trading_standards .
2	i advise everyone out there not to deal with this company or with [_name_removed ].
2	they are not serious and are out to rip people off .
2	i wish i had read the reviews on this company before ordering anything from them .
2	you have been warned .
2	deal with them at your_own peril !
2	do your homework and search for reviews on this company .
2	i wish i had done that before i had any dealings with them .
2	just returned from boston , and want to thank jonathan for looking after me so well .
2	it was my first visit to the states and i had a fabulous time .
2	the flights and connections were excellent , and it was all made a lot_easier with jonathans experience , advice and help .
2	beautiful piece of furniture delivered on time by friendly , helpful professionals .
2	will buy more !
2	backgammon_set bought as birthday_gift for my husband and he was very pleased with it .
2	well made , good sized set with quality appearance ; easy to pack away and carry in its own wooden case .
2	does what it says on the jar !
2	excellent , quick service and arrived well_packed in bubble_wrap etc .
2	highly_recommended .
2	such , fast service - mic arrived to my home ( from the us !)
2	in less_than a week and well in time for christmas_present !
2	staff very helpful in every way - as i had mentioned goods were for a gift , they even called up to explain where item coming from plus estimate of how long it would take etc , and gave commitment to exchange goods if there was a problem .
2	highly_recommend - would definitely use again .
2	appalling incompetent untrained staff !!!
2	i moved_house on 0th_oct_0000 and it took until the middle of feb_0000 to receive all the money they owed me as i was in credit when i moved , after many expensive phone_calls and being on hold for a ridiculous_amount of time i was almost reduced to tears of frustration after they credited the wrong account and said i couldnt have my money until they found out where the money had gone , if i wasnt so stubborn i would have given up , but why should they keep my money , please_please dont use them i just wish i had seen this site earlier ..
2	i ordered some canisulin needles at very competitive_prices , arrived first_class , postage free , perfect product .
2	excellent fast service , very pleased and will certainly recommend and use again .
2	ordering prescription_drugs was so easy being_able to upload the prescription .
2	very quick delivery and the items ordered were perfect and very well priced .
2	emails kept me informed each_stage of my order .
2	overall an excellent service and i will highly_reccommend viovet .
2	the only_thing that would have helped is if the couriers put the delivery instruction on the driver '_s paper_work as well as on the parcel .
2	we have used printerland to buy printer consummables since 0000 , their prices are competitive and deliveries are always quick , often next_day .
2	i spent hours trying to unlock my second_hand iphone , with no luck ( i earn £_00 an_hour so in time alone , it must '_ve cost me over_£_000 ).
2	officialphoneunlock had it working in two_days ,, so easy , i didn_'_t have to do anything except place the order , and much_cheaper_than doing it myself , lesson_learnt !, i , will use them again and save myself a load of hassle !
2	loads of fun and action for all the family .
2	delivery really fast and very good prices .
2	i ordered the " this works " travel set on the 00th_april and chose the uk saver premium delivery and it did not turn_up in time for my holiday on 00nd .
2	i was very disappointed as i am addicted to the this works products and find their cleanser the best i have ever used .
2	still i have my little bag of goodies for my next trip .
2	i will change my delivery instructions next time .
2	this site has a very wide_range of products including palmers that we all love .
2	getting holiday essentials all in one place at very good prices .
2	have told family and friends they know that im critical so they are impressed and will try you .

2	will be happy to use viovet again .
2	i have just received my goods and everything was in perfect order and the packaging was really secure .
2	i was able to get my purchases a lot_cheaper_than in the shops and also some that i have not seen in shops so its been a great help to me .
2	i cant_wait to look to see what else i need and send my next order .
2	the blinds are good quality and arrived very quickly .
2	i would not look anywhere_else now as these blinds are far_superior to the last supplier and have transformed my home .
2	for the fifth time i purchased something so large that even my keen appetite to save pennies could not match the service on offer from shiply .
2	i had a 0 foot square solid_wood garden feature delivered 000_miles for £_00 .
2	even if it were something i could have fitted in a large family hatchback , the fuel and time required for collection would have still made shiply the better option .
2	thank_you guys !

2	i was very impressed with wild_bird direct .
2	the website was easy to use .
2	the prices were brilliant .
2	the 0 kgs of dried mealworms cost me £_00 compared with £_00 it would have cost me to purchase from a local petfood superstore .
2	delivery was prompt and i received an up date informing_me of the time frame for delivery .
2	unfortunately as a new customer i did not know this would come so i did not check my emails and did not receive this until after i received the goods .
2	the update is a great idea .
2	it would be good to be informed that this was going to happen so it is of most benefit .
2	always reliable and good value
2	this is my 0th time with you and i have had no_issues atall everything is so straight_forward , just how i like it
2	having bought a second_hand battery_powered sit on car for our grandson , we were a little disappointed that the battery did not hold its charge .
2	we found a replacement on the allbatteries site and we are thrilled .
2	it arrived promptly and works like a dream and it was very reasonably_priced .
2	will certainly shop again .
2	service was superb .
2	free next_day delivery .
2	bought the item monday_afternoon and it was delivered at nine thirty the following_morning .
2	i have dealt_with this company both on and off ebay , and have always had excellent service , but this time they have excelled_themselves .
2	i also received an_email with a link to trace the package and found out which hour it was to be delivered .
2	i didn_'_t get chance to use it as the parcel was here so quickly .
2	their goods are also competitive_prices and i would definitely recommend them .
2	fast dispatch , packaged well , good service .
2	many_thanks .
2	as a business customer i expect a response from a lodged complaint .
2	not an_automated email .
2	birmingham parcelforce depot have given me excuses ranging_from , the parcel was outsourced to another courier , the driver has no mobile and no means of communication in his van , a manager has_gone out with the driver to locate the parcel etc .
2	this depot are obviously having fun at my expense !
2	good luck with that attitude .
2	i am already looking for another company .
2	i would definitely use again , infact , i wouldnt use anyone_else now !!!
2	very very pleased with every_aspect of service !
2	i live less_than 0 mins drive from my local asda , southport .
2	however , i would rather drive aprox 00miles to aintree asda , as their staff actually want to be of service to the customer . they are all only too pleased to help and assist , and i can_honestly_say , not one member of staff didnt have a smile on their face and obviously wanted to be working there .
2	my local asda on the other hand , should maybe send their staff , or managers to aintree store , and see how polite floor staff should be to customers .
2	well_done aintree branch , i will be shopping with you again very soon .
2	i placed my order , and increased it to an amount were i would benefit from free delivery .
2	when i got to checkout , my quantities had been reduced .
2	i telephoned customer_services , wish i hadnt , as they were not really interested and said that i would just have to pay the delivery , and that the items were now not available . i placed my order anyway .
2	out of curiosity , i went back to the item , and guess_what , i ordered another 0 of the item i had been told was not in stock .
2	i again had to pay delivery charge at £ 0 . 00 , thats £ 0 . 00 for each order .
2	had the system worked properly in the first place , i would have no delivery charges .
2	£ 0 . 00 all because there is an obvious glitch somewhere in pet planets system .
2	time i think to look for another online supplier !!
2	!
2	open_rent is truly the future of lettings .
2	with one simple on line advert , we got our property in all the big sites and had lots of enquiries and it was soon let .
2	the most amazing part is that you can take as much or as little as you want by way of services .
2	i had the advert fairly widely distributed , the references checked and the first months rent sorted_out plus the deposit paid into the dps .
2	everything was communicated by email as soon as each_stage was completed .
2	including the actual tenancy which was also on line .
2	then it is visible for either party to see .
2	i think it was money well spent and would definitely use it again .
2	they do what it says on the tin .
2	plus they even arranged the gas safety check .
2	the guy found that there was a very bad join in one of our gas appliances behind a kitchen_cupboard and resoldered it there and then .
2	he did it so quickly that we did not pay extra .
2	it was really efficient and i cannot imagine ever going into one of those lettings agencies again .
2	it is often off putting that you cant speak to anyone when you use an on line service , but these_guys are also on the end of a phone , call you if they think it would be useful and are really enthusiastic and friendly .
2	my account states that i have been paid , alas my bank_account says not !
2	since 00st_july i have been fobbed_off with many excuses , the last one via_email last wednesday apologising (!)
2	that they were experiencing system failer but that i would receive my refund after 00 working hours , these expired yesterday and there is still no credit into my bank as of now !
2	i cannot_believe those people that have had a ' happy ' result !
2	i would not recommend this company !
2	if you want a quick return for your old ipad just go to zoomfish , best price and best of all immediate cash , no_hassle !
2	have been using a number of products and everyone of them has_been great .
2	i was doubtful on buying sunglasses online but with a free delivery and return_policy it was not much of an issue , nonetheless to avoid any disappointments , i did try them out in a shop beforehand just to make_sure they suited !
2	the delivery was amazing , within 00h !
2	not to mention a saving on high_street prices !
2	can always find the products i need , quickly and read_reviews from other customers to ensure that this is the product i really want .
2	delivery is speedy , well - packaged and reasonably_priced .
2	what more could a girl want ?
2	marvellous service every time !
2	amazon was the first place i ever bought from on the internet , all those years_ago !
2	since then , i have purchased not only books , but kitchen_equipment , games , jewellery , shoes - all beautifully_packaged and with speedy delivery too !
2	what a wonderfully diverse company !
2	will always have a soft spot for amazon - they were very kind and patient with me , when i was a " learner " shopper !
2	bless !
2	fantastic service always from tesco '_s !
2	this is made even better by the sheer range of products available !
2	not only have i had cases of wine delivered , but also , my grocery_shopping , gardening products , computer games and furniture !

2	slow dispatch time .
2	i have bought many quality things from this company and even when the slightest little thing goes_wrong you only need to cantact them and i can_vouch for this they are more than fair . the only problem with this company is i like a whinge now and again and they give me no reason to have one . thanks for opening new doors with new products , i have now gone from one holiday a year to three a year only through selling your products .

2	on 00 november i ordered a hamper for my sister and nieces through ihampers , a subsidiary of iflorist .
2	i requested that the hamper be delivered on 00 december .
2	as i live in cape_town , south_africa i have sent hampers on a number of occasions through other_companies without_any_problems at all and as i had ordered in good time , i fully expected the hamper to be delivered on the selected date .
2	wrong !
2	the hamper was only delivered on 00 december causing me much embarrassment as my sister had assumed i had forgotten her .
2	on 00 december i e_- mailed ihampers to express my displeasure and only received a reply on 0 january offering me a 0 pound voucher off my next purchase - obviously a very safe offer as they are probably only too well aware it will be the last time i use their service .
2	short and sweet excellent product first_class service will definitely will recommend and be back for more
2	i always have trouble getting shoes .
2	i take a size nine and you '_d think i was something most shoe shops had never_heard of .
2	if we ' re so rare ( and also the ones who take a size 0 ) how come the suppliers say they stock them but are always ' sold out ', they must have sold them to someone , or are they just kidding us ?
2	by the time i '_ve finished going round all the shops , and then searching what seems like the whole internet for something that doesn_'_t look like a 0000 '_s midwife '_s shoe , i '_m frustrated , depressed and ready to give up .
2	that '_s where shoes . co . uk came in .
2	they say they have size 0 '_s , they actually have size 0 '_s , they don_'_t look like granny '_s cast - offs and guess_what , they supply them in a couple of days .
2	well_done , i '_ll shop again , you ' re stars !
2	very fast service , item exactly as_described .
2	very pleased with value and will shop_here again .
2	thank_you !

2	idiots .
2	just got it and i '_m very annoyed .
2	my puppy cake mix has exploded all over the new toy and dog_food .
2	i thought it was sand at first !
2	maybe the packaging wasn_'_t quite right as i was expecting a box , but they shouldn_'_t be handling things bad in the first place !

2	i '_ve_used them before and will again , never any_problems with delivery and items always arrive in decent time and in perfect_condition .
2	as previously stated , i cannot recommend this service highly_enough .
2	the website is simple to use , listing services , instructions and prices clearly .

2	items were picked_up and delivered promptly .
2	the guy '_s on the road and the guy '_s & " behind the keyboard / phone " are friendly , knowledgeable and helpful .

2	it came very securely flat packed and took me a few_minutes to assemble .
2	it is a solid_piece of kit and it is now full of my dog '_s food , treats , spare bowls etc , etc .
2	it is almost full but i can pull it out of it '_s space to clean as it is on coasters .
2	i would recommend this if you need some strong extra storage .
2	compared with some of the alternatives on the market , although it costs a little more , it is well_worth it as it is very strong , holds loads , and can be moved easily .
2	it was delivered precisely as it stated and well_packaged .
2	i ordered a photo_book from jessops as a present for someone , and received it in 00_hours .
2	the book was perfect , pictures looking just as i expected and the recipient was delighted !
2	if you want a very quick , and efficient service for a photo_book that will accurately record your event , then use jessops .
2	i could not fault the service or quality of their very basic photo_book , which cost just £_00 .
2	i imagine that their better quality ones are even better and will be ordering one as soon as i have the right subject matter .
2	there is no better recommendation than someone re - using a service !
2	!

2	i had two bedrooms fitted last_week .

2	worse still i complained a week_ago and the only response i have received so far is an_email to say if i don_'_t receive a response in 00 working_days that i can phone them .
2	it '_s amazing to see hammonds response to another_reviewer that should would receive a response within 00_hours !

2	i '_ll be back and thank_you for the highlighter freebie !
2	net_curtain and spring_loaded rod came very quickly and were perfect for what i wanted - to cover a small window at floor level in our bedroom .
2	very pretty design of butterflies .
2	tension_rod is excellent and easy to install would definitely recommend this company .
2	a pleasurable_experience from the word go .
2	the lady i spoke to on the phone was friendly , courteous and extremely_helpful and went out of her way to answer my concerns about exact_measurements for a built in fridge_freezer .
2	she phoned me back when promised ( something that never normally happens with companies ) and took me through the whole_process of buying and arranging delivery with clearly a smile on her face .
2	delivery was then exactly when i wanted and details were texted and emailed to me beforehand .
2	delivery driver was friendly and helpful and another smiley_face !!

2	i have recommended inerd to several people because of the good service i have received .
2	they are very patient !
2	from odering to delivery the service was just great . both of our orders arrived on time and were well_packaged .
2	what more could we ask for ?
2	one stop_shop for all my health_food requirements , easy to compare with clear_descriptions , i like the choice of different brands , sizes and prices to get exactly_what i want ,.
2	the goods arrived about a week after i ordered them on both_occasions and were well_packaged , i am very pleased that i have found this company .
2	once the tap was installed it finished off the kitchen , a statement piece which is functional , the hose extension is so useful .
2	i am amazed_at the quality for the price compared to the stores i visited .
2	delivery was extremely prompt .
2	although i ordered over the christmas_period and other_companies were blaming this for late arrivals of other purchases , i received my package the next_day with everything intact - i had stumbled over this site when looking for good quality affordable knitwear , i have not been disappointed and have been telling anyone who will listen .
2	we arrived late ( 0 . 00 on friday_night ).
2	the welcome staff ensured that we were able to eat before we checked in so that we didn_'_t have to go out again .

2	special thanks to our pilot charlie for all his special personna
2	i just finished placing my third order with supplement_warehouse .
2	in the past my orders arrived quickly and they price matched one time because i found a lower price on another web_site .
2	the order i just placed was for 0 bottles of a supplement that is in limited supply elsewhere and this was the best price on the web .
2	i will be back :)
2	i think argus_car_hire is a scam company .
2	we booked our car_hire with plenty of room for our_luggage ( argus actually states people and luggage capacity on their website ) and paid .
2	when we arrived in florida to collect our car , they said that what we had paid for was a much smaller car and would not hold the luggage we had .
2	we confirmed that we did in fact pay for the right size stated on argus ' website , but they were not having any of it .
2	in order to proceed getting the size we had originally paid for , we would have to pay extra .
2	we were completely at a loss as to what to do , especially with the time difference , we could not phone argus up and explain the situation .
2	anyway we paid the extra , which turned_out double what we paid for the car originally and we decided to take it up with argus when we arrived back .
2	it took them ages to respond and when they did , all they said was we had upgraded .
2	we did not upgrade !
2	we appealed the decision but still nothing .
2	so , it is either argus who are not describing the size of vehicle properly or it is alamo in florida who say you have undersized just to get you to pay extra , both mis_- advertising .
2	either way it is extremely bad business and in my eyes its a scam .
2	it is a terrible thing to have to go through this at the start of your holiday and we had not budgeted for this extra , so it had to come out of our spending money .
2	as i hire_cars when i go away , i will never , ever consider_using this company again and i will tell as many people as possible to do the same .
2	what it said on the web is what happened , good service .
2	really impressed with the prices and delivery was excellent
2	so pleased to have found you at the click of a button
2	this is the best online company we '_ve dealt_with by a mile .
2	as we live fairly near the company , i called to ask if we could view the products before buying .
2	a rather cheeky request , but marilyn was extremely_helpful and opened up especially for us on a saturday - apologies , marilyn , if i '_ve set a precedent here ....
2	the goods were exactly as_described : terrific quality at a great price .
2	we bought the eames_chair and lem barstools and they were delivered as requested the following friday .
2	we ' re delighted with them .
2	what a joy to do_business with such a friendly , professional company .
2	we '_ll definitely be spending more money here .
2	when i received my canvas i was so disappointed due to an_error i made in the size .
2	this was immediately rectified by hello_canvas and they redone my order without_any quibble .
2	first_class customer service and the quality of the canvas was excellent .
2	i will have no_hesitation_recommending hello_canvas .
2	a big thank_you to them all .
2	tracey , from millisle
2	quickly resolved internet order hiccup , which was probably my fault , goods received following_day .
2	excellent , efficient and polite service .
2	just received my ilumi order , got great offer , and free delivery , choice of meat and veggie dishes great and they taste just as if you '_d made them at home , storage is simple and doesn_'_t fill up the freezer because they are able to be stored for a year in the cupboard !
2	amazing !
2	and all the meal are ' free from '
2	wanted to replace my old running shoes , barrington_sports offered a great price and then more discount !
2	delivery excellent - next_day - would recommend you give them a try .
2	absolutely love my new trainers !
2	we bought a washing_machine from this company after_reading the product description and believing it would fit into our new_kitchen .
2	when we tried to install it we found the depth was considerable more than stated on the website ( the drum_sticks out quite a way )
2	we emailed 000 .
2	they didn_'_t reply .
2	eventually we reached them by phone and asked if we could exchange it for another machine which would fit .
2	they refused , even_though the replacement would have cost us £_000 more .
2	they won_'_t give us a full_refund either and say we '_d have to lose 00_% of the purchase price .
2	e_- tyres were great .
2	cant speak more highly of them .
2	they did not have the tyres i paid for in time so they rang me straight_away and offered me a more_expensive pair for the same price .
2	young_man that came to fit them was pleasant and helpful .
2	all in all i couldn_'_t have asked for more
2	those annoying vets tell you to feed this n that , but then tell you they don_'_t stock it !
2	the pet_stores also , don_'_t stock it because it '_s classed_as prescription food or meds .
2	so how do you get your pet better ?
2	wait for weeks for your vet to order it ?
2	nope !
2	go online and get it now , well to be honest delivery is a bit_slow , but if you order in good time you can save your pet .
2	i did !
2	ordered my glasses , they came and were lovely .
2	however they did not have a wide field of variofocal vision as their website claims .
2	the viewing area was about 0mm at the bottom .
2	the website claims show this as being about an inch .
2	they were actually the narrowest field of variofocal i have ever_experienced .
2	i sent them back the same day .
2	seven weeks_later after numerous_emails and phone_calls , i still have no refund .
2	once you '_ve ordered and paid you have to go to the banks or courts to get your money back .
2	avoid like the plague !
2	i '_ve had to go to my bank and register a dispute .
2	the banks response ?
2	this is a very dodgy retailer !
2	that says it all really .
2	don_'_t go there !
2	brilliant service , great site , huge choice of lovely quality products , superfast delivery times .
2	also very helpful in relation to queries / exchanges / refunds .
2	all in all , excellent service - i '_ll def be back .
2	all well - nice item - as_described - fast delivery - recommended .
2	zavvi offered the best deal on the game i bought and it was despatched_immediately .
2	brilliant service .
2	would definitely recommend them
2	easy to use website .
2	great prices .
2	order arrived within the time period stated .
2	would use again
2	fast service excellent value for money
2	fantastic value fast delivery good communication via_e_mail would definately recommend
2	ordered 0 tallboys from bedroom_furniture world on 00th_march still_waiting for them 0th_april 00 days_later even allowing for bank_holidays delivery is a joke .
2	emailed the company on 00th_march asking where delivery was they replied_saying it would be delivered now after easter .
2	used their tracking_system to find out delivery company used would be xdp derby .
2	item finally reached derby apparently on 0th_april when it was apparently put out for delivery .
2	derby depot apparently put the items out for delivery on 0th_april and apparently put a card through the door .
2	they apparently were going to deliver it yesterday pm slot despite waiting in again guess_what its still not here .
2	i use the word apparently a lot here because its a bit of a guessing game as at no point have i been emailed or texted or rang to say the delivery is on its way .
2	off my own back i have attempted to contact the derby depot this alone is a joke .
2	the depots landline_number is actually a voicemail for a mobile number .
2	i have rung this number left numerous messages and only twice been rung back .
2	i have been given excuses like they have a backlog , the driver isnt answering his phone , the drivers are behind because they cant go out until the hub arrives ?
2	!!!!
2	i phoned bedroom_furniture world yesterday after waiting in a queue for ages finally spoke to someone_who said the item was definately out for delivery yesterday pm .
2	well it never arrived .
2	the xdp depot also state a card was put through my door on 0th_april well it most definately was not .
2	at the time it was apparently carded on 0th_april at 00 . 00 my husband was in the house .!!!
2	i am absolutely_disgusted with the apalling service i couldnt recommend to anyone .
2	i have lost money on phonecalls and time waiting in for a delivery that never arrives
2	dear prachi , i have already complained on your website on the same day i left the review .
2	today i have received a mobile phone answer phone message to say that the van that was delivering my items broke_down on friday another excuse !
2	the van with my furniture is apparently at the garage being fixed and i may !!!!
2	get it delivered tomorrow !!
2	i wonder_if i am to put my life on hold just in case i may receive the items ?
2	i also wonder what state the items may be in if they ever arrive having been out on the van for 0_days and now at the garage .
2	my order no by the way is the one sent already to your website .
2	i shall e_mail your site again to say that this must be escalated to senior level as it is beyond a joke .
2	thankyou
2	update 00 / 00 / 00 definately wouldnt use this company again shocking customer service !!!!!!.
2	the only way to contact customer service is to sit in a telephone queue for approx 00_mins or e_mail them and expect a rubbish response in a couple of days .
2	they are fond of posting a response on here that looks like they are going to do something about it but then they dont .
2	i eventually received my furniture after all this time .
2	as soon as it reached my door i had to turn it away as the furniture was broken !!!!
2	i then e_mailed world_stores to complain again .
2	i asked for a refund which they are supposedly doing although it hadnt reached my card yet .
2	despite me asking for some senior response to my complaints they seem to have ignored this all together all they did was send a brief e_mail apologising for my experience and stating they would refund to my card .
2	so no response as to what they thought of it all , no response from senior_management by way of apology .
2	so its seems their management arent really interested in customer service .
2	what does this tell you ??
2	rubbish company
2	ordered some bedroom_furniture through bedroom world on 00th_march items still not arrived 00 / 00 / 00 !!
2	items apparently arrived at depot in derby on on the 0th_april and was apparently put out for delivery on the same day .
2	i say apparently because i had no phonecalls to say the delivery was coming out to me .
2	the xdp website then shows as carded at 0 . 00_pm .
2	this is a complete lie no card was put through our door and neither was any attempt made to deliver the items .
2	on the 0th the item was put out for a pm delivery again with no contact to myself made by the company .
2	i waited in until_0pm and guess_what the items didnt appear ?
2	!!
2	according to xdp website their driver must be working all night as its says its still out for delivery from yesterdays pm slot ?
2	!!
2	i myself have used bedroom world tracking_system and have attempted to phone the derby depot .
2	the landline_number given diverts to a mobile voicemail .
2	i have phoned the mobile number several_times .
2	the majority of time it is not answered .
2	on the odd time it has_been answered by a lady_who has told me they have been delayed because of waiting for a hub to come in so the drivers can get out , also they have a backlog and have taken on extra drivers also that the drivers dont answer their phones also promised the items would be delivered .
2	it is an_absolute_joke especially as bedroom world state you can watch a video to say how reliable their delivery is .
2	i am_disgusted with xdp and their service and not impressed with bedroom world either .
2	my advice would be to use neither
2	update 00 / 00 / 00 .
2	items finally arrived .
2	items damaged on arrival .
2	had to return immediately !!!.
2	i managed to find a number for head_office customer service .
2	i spoke to a very helpful and polite lady called barbara who was very kind .
2	i have asked her to pass my complaints onto the regional manager who will address hopefully some of the issues i have had with xdp .
2	obviously its too late for me now as i couldnt possibly face the process of going through a reorder of the item .
2	so i have cancelled and requested a refund from world_stores who run bedstore .
2	i am most unhappy with their customer service as well and have left them a seperate review on this site .
2	i dont normally leave negative_reviews as things do go_wrong at times , i think i am a reasonable person but have been pushed too far on this occasion .
2	i would also like to think by me complaining it may improve their customer service for the next person ?
2	i can only hope so !!!!
2	!
2	will certainly give sportsbikeshop first look when i '_m looking for any bike related gear .
2	great prices and fast delivery
2	too many_times_now we '_ve bought goods from good honest traders only for them to be let_down by their choice of courier .
2	the first parcel arrived 0_weeks late and it was thrown outside our from door , when i complained about their service to the driver he became aggressive and said i should watch myself because parcels can sometimes go missing
2	every time since then parcels delivered to me by this company have taken a minimum of 0_weeks to arrive .
2	it has got so bad that i now ask the people i '_m buying from if they use myhermes or not , if they do use them i politely refuse to buy from them .
2	total_joke of a company
2	my sister was absolutely_delighted with the bouquet i sent for her_birthday / anniversary .
2	as always , serenata_flowers delivers the best quality , value for money service .
2	would recommend to anyone who_wants to order online flowers . thank_you
2	regards
2	annette london
2	children had a great perty with their new outfits worn well and washed well .
2	ready for the next party thank_you
2	ordered goods arrived within a couple of days .
2	well impressed goods all intact .
2	i have been spoilt rotten today .
2	my husband took me to marlows and with the help of kym we chose some wonderful pieces of jewellery , a diamond_ring , necklace and earrings that all compliment one another .
2	kym was very helpful throughout our shopping_experience and even had the ring_resized within a couple of hours , which was great for us as we had travelled from leicestershire .
2	my hubby has already promised to take me back to look at a bracelet in the future .
2	i love the friendliness of the staff and we really did not feel under any pressure to buy and would certainly recommend marlows to all my friends .
2	we booked for meet and greet with gls .
2	we called 0 mobile nos that were provided on the booking about 00_mins before we reached gatwick , but no reply on one of them .
2	the other mobile was switched off !.
2	this was between 0 . 00 and 0am .
2	i had called one of the nos about 0_days before , and he had told me to call him about 00_mins before i get to the airport and they will pick_up the car .
2	i must have made over 00 calls in total .
2	talk about stress_free parking !
2	we waited around .. spoke to all the wardens and other meet and greets no one heard of them ..
2	we had to park in the short_stay as we were getting late .
2	we had to pay £_000 for 0_days .
2	i have asked to be compensated with the refund of the booking , short_stay chages and compensation for the stress it caursed me and my family .
2	they are not prepared to refund the short_stay car_parking charges as they say they contacted us - which is a lie !
2	i can get a proof of the calls made and received from my phone .
2	now lets see what_happens : (
2	this was at gatwick not at heathrow .
2	got a reply from the company and they just come up with lies after lies , saying now that he was waiting for us before we even called him !
2	now he can read our_minds !
2	!
2	best communications , fast delivery , best products , best prices , free_samples make supplementwarehouse . com easy to recommend to my friends and family .
2	very good delivery service , was kept up to date by email and given 0 hour period to expect delivery .
2	they delivered exactly on time and were friendly and polite .
2	very pleased with my new glasses .
2	prompt delivery and glasses exactly as ordered and well fitting , perfect for reading .
2	have shopped with this company for nearly one year and find them very reliable , with good delivery and products .
2	the whole_transaction was completed very quickly with both the initial envelope and the cheque arriving by return at each_stage of the transaction .
2	the price offered for my nokia was also the best across the four options that i looked at .
2	i found mitchel & co online whilst_searching for engagement and wedding_rings .
2	i was impressed by the site and bowled_over when we visited the shop .
2	the knowledge and expertise of these_guys is second to none .
2	they are passionate_about their craft .
2	you are made to feel truly welcome when you visit and the jewellery that they make is utterly exquisite .
2	your budget and requirements are met without_hesitation .
2	when i went to collect my rings , i was speechless .
2	they are amazing !
2	i am often stopped in the street or out shopping by people to want to admire my rings and find out where i bought them .
2	i rave_about ; and recommend mitchel and co without_hesitation !
2	this trip was done to raise money in memory of my son darren rhys frost , who was tragically killed in a road_traffic accident on boxing_day 0000 , aged just 00 and for ty gobaith a children ’_s hospice in north_wales .
2	i want to start off by saying a huge thank_you to the whole team at private_kilimanjaro , it ’_s not until you actually start the climb that you appreciate just how much work goes in to organising the trip .
2	from the moment we arrived in kilimanjaro airport , we were made to feel_welcome by our driver , who was already waiting for us and a much welcome sight after a very long journey .
2	both hotels chosen for us , before and especially after were lovely and the debriefing we were given before the climb was very informative .
2	although i didn_’_t make it to the top ( i got to about 0000 meters ) the trip itself was absolutely amazing ; from the stunning scenery , the feeling of achievement at the end of each day when reaching our next camp , the food ( which was lovely ) and the exceptional help / waiter service from sissus ( sorry don_’_t know how to spell his name ).
2	i had lots of support from preygod and august our 0 guides and don_’_t think i ’ d have got as far without their encouragement and guidance .
2	i have no_hesitation and would definitely recommend private_kilimanjaro to anyone_thinking of doing this type of holiday and am now trying to work out how to get the funds together to go back .
2	i would like to personally thank everyone_involved and i hope to see them all again , soon .
2	thank_you so much for everything ,
2	hazel

2	i got plenty of emails and texts_letting_me know were and when my orders would be delivered , but they were all mixed up .... getting a text saying that the recipient have received their flowers and then an_email_saying they would be sent the next_day .
2	first time using them , don_'_t think i will use again !!
2	!

2	i have been impressed by the speed with which my orders are delivered .
2	i also think the products are great and i particularly_like being_able to give healthy supplements to my dogs instead of drugs .
2	the discounts for regular customers are welcome .
2	i had a problem once with a discount_code not working online , but after emailing the company it was sorted promptly and courteously .

2	i would have no_hesitation in recommending healthspan - indeed i already have done , and have recruited two friends and my sister to the faithful following !
2	keep doing what you are doing - you cannot go_wrong .
2	thank_you for your excellent service !
2	i placed my first order with stone_bridge 0 - 0 years_ago ( i think ) and i '_ve never looked back .
2	they have quality accessories and so far outpace the competition when it comes to selection that i rarely buy anything for my hair elsewhere , in_spite of travelling a lot abroad .
2	they also provide a great service through their really excellent , friendly staff .
2	you will love receiving their parcels - the quick delivery and really lovely ( but not wasteful ) packaging , added to the fabulous items inside , leaves me with a smile on my face every time !
2	:)
2	if you need hangers for your wardrobe , or for a business , this is a great place to go .
2	i '_m very happy with the selection offered , the price , the speed of delivery , the packaging and the product i now use .
2	i recommend shopfitting_warehouse and would use them again .
2	found this site by comparing mobile phone_recycling .
2	many reviews on other_providers suggested that you didn_'_t actually get what was quoted once the phone was in their hands , whereas this was not the case for mazuma reviews .
2	very prompt service and very prompt payment too .
2	recommend highly .
2	found this company via a google_search .
2	free delivery was a huge incentive , and given that i only needed three panels , a real_bonus .
2	company rang me to arrange mutually_convenient delivery time .
2	delivery came without_any_issues .
2	fence_panels are great .
2	would highly_recommend .
2	very easy to use website , i booked flight , transfer , hotel and travel_insurance - having compared other_providers too .
2	confirmations sent after each booking , good value payment options .
2	had an_immediate call when requested accommodation wasn_'_t available , with acceptable alternative offered .
2	will_definately use again . thank_you .
2	:-)
2	we booked through james_villas and the whole_process was fast efficient and simple .
2	they were great to contact and were always very helpful .
2	easy online booking_system backed_up by real people at the end of the phone .
2	the rep in the country was great and very helpful , just a phone_call away .
2	absolutely wonderful experience from_start to finish , the only_thing that could have improved it would be a private jet , but i '_m guessing that may be expecting a bit too much !!
2	well_done james_villas , you have restored my faith in travel companies !
2	very good service .
2	kept us informed by e_- mail on the progress & delivered a day earlier_than said .
2	the computer is working fine no_problems so far
2	very helpful when i rang to say dpd had not delivered within the time_slot explaining what had probably happened ,
2	dpd did deliver that evening after making pick - ups in the area
2	ordered on friday_afternoon and it was delivered on saturday_morning
2	it didn_'_t take long to hang the heavy_mirror . looks great .
2	good product and very good service
2	ordered for christmas as a last addition .
2	website easy to negotiate and t - shirts arrived promptly after emails to advise of progress .
2	fantastic website and service .
2	thank_you
2	ordered clear fence oil and it arrived within the specified time frame .
2	was kept_informed by text on the progress of my order , right through to the expected time of delivery !
2	would not_hesitate to use wood_finishes direct again .
2	the mattress was good but the bed that we bought with it was rubbish , the slats broke and fell out when we wanted a refund they only gave_us £_00 although we paid £_000 .
2	do not buy this bed , no compansation even although they agreed the bed was faulty
2	i liked the service of sending texts and e_mails of dispatch and delivery .
2	the flowerd were lovely .
2	this is a brill website to book your specialist trips_abroad - easy and no_nonsense site ...
2	first_class , especially before christmas
2	i always buy my kerastase_products from active_beauty as they are always competitively_priced and a very fast delivery service .
2	thank_you active_beauty
2	" always hugely good value , especially in a sale !
2	and prompt delivery .
2	thank_you dapw .
2	i will always use you ."
2	always helpful , always value .
2	always speedy , always polite , pretty_damn good actually !
2	wowcher say what they do and then do it ....
2	what more can you want !
2	!
2	i always find my best deals on flights and holidays with expedia , simple , try them yourself , what have you got to lose ?
2	we placed our order one day and it practically came the next it was fantastic i would rate reliability and product excellent .
2	we bought an ipod 0th_generation not realising it wasn_'_t the right model , we sent the ipod back to student_computers who gladly took the ipod back and after a small miscommunication upgraded this to the next 0th_generation model all within a day of christmas .
2	this service was very professional and very quick , would definately use them again .
2	i tried these_guys once , fortunately paying through paypal so did not have trouble getting a refund .
2	i have tried again as they have stuff i want .
2	again they have debited my paypal_account immediately and my order now shows " awaiting picking ".
2	not sure at this stage if this order will work .
2	will update .
2	however , do not attempt to purchase from them unless through paypal / credit_card or some other means of getting your money back .
2	easy_peasy ordering , payment , and prompt delivery .
2	thoroughly_recommend .
2	i did not receive what i ordered for a long time .
2	i sent 0 - 0 emails asking where the product was .
2	now , over a month after my bank card has_been debited , i telephone to find that my order has " been lost in the post ".
2	in addition , the company is awaiting delivery of my item and will not despatch for a further week !
2	i cannot understand_why the company has never responded to my emails - and when i telephoned i got through to something like a call_centre who could not actually do anything .
2	i do not rate this company in terms of efficiency but cannot , as yet , comment on their product .
2	since changing couriers the delivery has_been a nightmare , i am promised delivery but they just dont turn_up .
2	affordable_supplements to their credit do then act quickly by either refunding or using another courier .
2	bottom line is they need to change the courier they use or will loose a lot of business mine included .
2	i have sold lots of old cd '_s in the last few_years but no - one beats ziffit .
2	they are fast , easy , and offer the best prices .
2	payment is fast too !
2	cant recommend them highly_enough .
2	can '_t fault this company at all ; googled a few companies who were only offering half the price zoomfish offered .
2	sent off my request and within days had received envelope to send my mobile free of charge .
2	less_than 0_days letter received an e_- mail_confirming_receipt and later same day received e_- mail_confirming payment .
2	what a service !
2	will definitely use zoomfish again .
2	my husband uses diet_chef ( i pinch the soups ).
2	he easily went from a 00 '' waist to a 00 in a few short months -( i had to keep making new holes in his belt every few_weeks ).
2	that was over a year_ago now .
2	after doing the plan for 0_months we used it alongside ' normal ' eating for another 0 . now he is on a month of ' top up ' diet_chef .
2	- in all the time since the last box he hasn_'_t put on weight as he is now eating more healthierfoods ( that means no more 0 or 0 chocolate_bars a day ).
2	and he hasn_'_t even missed the chocolate
2	for me it is very helpful as i pick his main_meal from the cupboard and just have to add the veg / pots / rice - so helpful for both of us in different_ways as we don_'_t eat the same things or at the same time .
2	this time we have tried the popcorn -- that '_s passed the taste test and a packet lasts a few_days as nibbles .
2	even if you have no real weight to lose it is worth getting a box for a month as it helps to give different ideas of what to eat and saves the faff of deciding what to eat .
2	clear item description on the web_site .
2	item dispatched quickly .
2	no_negatives .
2	delivered as promised and i found the price very competetive and far cheaper_than my vet wanted to charge me .
2	i ordered late at night - next_day was told item was not in stock .
2	i e_- mailed to clarify and recv '_d a reply the same day .
2	0_days_later i was told stock had arrived and i received a text the following_morning to say package would be delivered that day or i could pick an_alternative .
2	to be kept up to date and receive such prompt action is a refreshing_change .
2	and the price was very competetive as well .
2	having ordered a case for my kindle_fire hd , and receiving , a case for a kindle_fire
2	i was forced to return it . i was not to happy that i had to pay the postage on my return , and asked for a refund . since then bmc digital have bent_over_backwards to rectify the situation , and i have to hold my hands up and say i may have ordered incorrectly . they have been gracious , not condescending and above all polite .
2	i wish more firms treated its customers like this . so i would like to withdraw my recent review on trustpilot in which i spoke of my dissatisfaction . i am more than happy with the outcome , and would like to thank bmc for their help . i will certainly recommend them , and use them again
2	g . cure
2	i would like to expess my thanks to peter scarf for his professional and friendly service .
2	i now have peace of mind and would recommend key r solution to any of my friends .... thankyou .
2	only placed one order , but it arrived quickly , securely_packed .
2	would use this company again .
2	ordered dried_dog_food cost less_than other online_retailers .
2	delivered following_day free of charge fantastic .
2	will definitely use again .
2	have used last_minute for years for all_sorts of reasons , ordered tea for two at ritz as xmas_gift not expecting it to arrive in time , two_days_later arrived in a wonderful presentation gift pack from the ritz itself .
2	well_done last_minute .
2	on delivery day be prepared for a 0 . 0a . m phone_call to both numbers to tell you today is delivery day .
2	then another to say morning or afternoon .
2	then about 0 / 0 hour before .
2	then many emails after the event to check everything is ok .
2	i love the service but think its a little ott
2	we would highly_recommend parcel_hero and in fact wouldn_'_t consider_using anybody_else now .
2	we have sent 0 parcels to sweden , one to canada and a box of christmas_presents within the uk .
2	which we only sent last_minute due to a hiccup in our travel_plans this arrived at their destination at 0 . 0pm on xmas_eve .
2	yesterday we sent a letter / packet to london and were more than pleased with the service .
2	we like the fact that you can track your parcels on the internet .
2	our parcel to canada was given a two day delivery , it went from wales to cardiff , to birmingham to missisauga , back to stansted for scanning back to idaho , then missagua , then toronto and arrived two hours before its scheduled delivery time .
2	absolutely amazing !
2	i am very particular about my pens and pencils and will not buy off the shelf .
2	i have used cult_pens before and they stock the ideal puzzle pencil with a very narrow eraser on the top .
2	i can buy replacement erasers and leads .
2	i lost my pencil and ordered two replacements which arrived 00_hours_later .
2	what more is there to say !
2	genuinely was expected reasons_why not to pay .
2	i screwed_up sending all the ' extra '_s ' not just phone and charger .
2	it all happened really quick , payment was quicker_than_expected .
2	so easy to do .
2	totally pleased with the service and the price i received was more than reasonable .
2	returned jacket for replacement didn_'_t get confirmation had to ring to find out status .
2	when replacement would be dispatched they couldnt tell me so i asked for a refund instead i am still_waiting .
2	unacceptable
2	goods ordered i was kept_informed goods arrived within a couple of days
2	job_done will definantely use them again great price as well i paid 0 . 00 for my face_cream it is currently on sale now in boots at 00 . 00

2	found the site and was surprised at the great prices .
2	ordered what i wanted and with some_trepidation waited for delivery .

2	very happy with everything .
2	no_fuss , easy to order and quick to deliver .
2	will use again and recommend highly
2	ordered contact fluids one evening , great price and it arrived just two_days_later .
2	if you want a reliable company to buy from then 000electrical is the web_site to look at , they have everything you need in electrical goods at reasonable_prices with a fantastic delivery service , you won_'_t be disappointed , take a look for yourself and treat_yourself like i did .
2	i needed a new plastic cover for my very old ( 00 + years ) kitchen fan , and hadn_'_t a clue how to find it .
2	whomever i emailed on your site was very patient and quickly found the right piece .
2	thank_you !
2	wish all shopping websites were this good !
2	everything i '_ve ordered from cult_beauty has_been innovative and of superb quality - nicer_than anything i could find in a department_store or chemist '_s .
2	plus the packaging is tasteful and orders turn_up with amazing speed .
2	well_done - and good luck for the future !
2	good service and product was perfect for the job .
2	this is a really convenient way to get what you need in as quick a time as possible

2	fast delivery and so much_cheaper_than purchasing from local_vets .
2	arrived 0_days after_placing order .
2	very happy with service , will be using again .
2	i had never used appliances_online before but had read great reviews and after a lot of research decided to order a washing_machine .
2	i opted for the next_day delivery at any time , as was at home all day and did `_t need a timle slot .
2	i received a text after_placing order , confirming delivery date and that i would be contacted after 0am next_day .
2	the next_morning , just after 0am i received a text_confirming washing_machine was on the road for delivery and giving timeslot of 00am - 0pm .
2	was very pleased with the extra info as i hadn `_t chosen a timeslot .
2	about 0 . 00 received a call from driver to say " sorry " delivery wouldn `_t be until at_least after 00am as they were busy !
2	no need to say sorry as they were not late .
2	then received text to say delivery between 00 . 00am - 0 . 00pm .
2	delivery arrived at 0pm .
2	drivers were very helpful taking away old machine and placing new one where i wanted .
2	later had problem with programming machine , so called helpline where james , was so polite and helpful , even calling me back at time specified .
2	problem sorted and i am very happy .

2	will be buying from them again .
2	very satisfied_customer .
2	thank_you
2	easy to order .

2	as i usually comb beards while dogs are sleeping .
2	otherwise very pleased with purchase and medicanimal .
2	frontline was much_cheaper_than well_known local_pet store .

2	delivery fast and website easy to use .
2	thanks
2	doesn_'_t seem useful to me and when i had an account there i had troubles writing those short messages .
2	not useful to me , sorry , but i like the logo alot .
2	:-)
2	the front page looks very spammy , i can not even check my emails or use the search without reading about the latest robert pattinson trash .
2	too bad , as i made my very first email account with yahoo :-(
2	free delivery , do i have to say more ?
2	:)
2	most of the times the price leader and very good handling .
2	i will_continue to shop_here !
2	somehow i don_'_t seem to have luck with internet providers .
2	always having problems with the connection and customer service .
2	same with 0 & 0 , sometimes i have people on the phone that are trying very hard , and sometimes they are just rude .
2	the company should really check who they are putting on the phone because this gives me a bad image of the company that really doesn_'_t have to be .
2	i flew with lufthansa 0 times already , two times short and two times long_distance .
2	the long_distance flight was awesome : excellent service , nice & experienced staff , great media centre with lots of movies to pick .
2	the short_distance flights were both delayed and the boarding was very weird , at first i thought wow this is superquick but then everybody was cramped in the dark tunnel in front of the plane and standing around for at_least 00_minutes instead of still staying in the boarding hall and doing it properly , with back seats first and so on .
2	i have mixed_feelings about this airline , i would need to fly with it again to see in which direction it is going .
2	but unfortunately most of the times its a very pricey option , although they land at the most convenient airports .
2	let '_s see !
2	i used to website to book a holiday to kreta last_year .
2	we got to the airport , were looking_forward to the holiday and - boom .
2	the flight was changed to one day earlier - but they didnt feel the need to give us this information .
2	i am still struggling with them to get my money back - even if this wouldn_'_t make up the dissapointment they caused us by this spoiled holiday .
2	will not use this site again !
2	i hear alot of people complaining_about the apple hype and the high prices but so far i didnt find a phone , an mp0_player or a laptop that give me the same quality and genuine design as apple .
2	people might complain - but i believe they have not tried the products before .
2	as a windows user i was always struggling with my pc and i dont have these problems any more since i am using a macbook_pro .
2	yes , it was expensive but it paid of a hundred times since my laptop would have been down by now and my macbook still reaches a battery lifetime of 0 hours .
2	my laptop didnt reach that to begin with and it was the same price .
2	so first before complaining : start using apple and i '_m 000_% sure you will not go back to windows ( except when youre an excessive gamer , then , i regret , you have no other choice ) :)
2	i think the fees on ebay are way too high ( 0 %!!!
2	), while prices go up for the sellers , it '_s good for buyers .
2	i sell alot of my clothes on ebay ( or at_least try to ) and most of them go away for a way too cheap price .
2	somehow people seem to have lost interest on bidding and ebaying .
2	it '_s really not the same as it used to be , i dont enjoy it as much as i did before and i am looking for other_sites to sell my perfectly new clothes now .
2	:(
2	the customer service of amazon is brilliant and quick ( you normally get a response within just minutes !!!
2	), the delivery is always on time and it '_s great that students can use amazon_prime a year for free .
2	when i order today i usually get my package tomorrow , it '_s lots quicker_than even going to the shops and searching for what you ' re looking for .
2	all in all the most trusted shop for me on the web , the cheapest prices and biggest selection of items .
2	as a previous user of kayak . com i now switched to the - in my opinion - much more developed hotel search_engine trivago . co . uk .
2	unfortunately trivago does not provide a flight comparison , yet ( again !
2	as they already had a beta out for that i believe ), but i can still use other platforms for that .
2	so then , why trivago ?
2	as a matter of fact , i ’_m quite a travelling expert and have visited umpteen of countries , cities and of course hotels – or at_least buildings that labeled themselves as such .
2	due to my bad as well as good experience i ’_m always looking for hotels with good reviews and an overall user satisfaction .
2	i think i can get that from trivago , as they have a strong community behind their site .
2	if i made a bad_experience with a “ hotel ” i always try – of course time is the issue here – to let other_users know to just make the site even more useful for other_users like me .
2	of course there are a few areas that are not as well developed yet , i saw that on the other platforms outside uk – there is still a lot of development going on from their side – but i believe it ’_s going somewhere .
2	besides the reviews / ratings i very much like the clean and simple design , the colors of the logo look appealing to me , in general the whole look and feel ( also of the tv spot !
2	have you seen the last one with the bearded guy ?
2	mhhh … sorry ;-)).
2	i also think it ’_s very intuitive to use .
2	it ’_s just great to be able to compare so many different platform just on one site and generally saves a lot time and money – it ’_s like google for hotels ;-) without advertisement , though !
2	very nice !
2	this makes me feel like the results are independent and not sponsored by certain partners , and that i really get the best price there is and not depending_on how much a partner paid for his result to be on top .
2	with the money to save i always give myself a treat – some exceptional dinner or an extra jet - ski ride , more souvenirs … i think you get the point .
2	why wasting money for getting exactly the same hotel ?
2	try trivago !!
2	!
2	thank_you trivago for many , many successful hotel findings … and more to come !
2	insureandgo covered all my husband '_s minor ailments with no_fuss , and at a very reasonable extra premium .
2	i would recommend them to anyone shopping for travel_insurance .
2	they even covered a friend to visit an active volcano on a research trip .
2	bought cystaphan at an excellent price .
2	very fast delivery .
2	great to be able to set_up an_email reminder for regular medication
2	i use to buy this product at an organic store , one time they run_out and need my husk , i start looking were to buy and find this place , the best i wont buy it at any other place .
2	i would recommend this firm to my friends as i have had good service all the time and their product '_s are fairly_priced .
2	also you receive the products really quickly i placed an order three pm and received it the very next_morning can '_t get better_than that brilliant
2	spent hours looking for perfect holiday and alpharooms was the site i kept going back to .
2	easy to use site and best prices .
2	gave_us widest choices at such a late date .
2	excellent !
2	we recently returned from a fantastic holiday in tanzania and zanzibar .
2	this was totally organised by linda who asked all the right questions and gave_us a holiday we could only dream of .
2	we felt like_royalty by all the special touches included in our holiday .
2	this was the first time my husband and i had gone away on our own for 00 years and we wanted it to be special and we were not disappointed .
2	we told our contact linda that it was important that we went somewhere different from the norm and she certainly supplied that in sending us on safari to the selous game park .
2	we felt like we were the only people in the world and were thoroughly spoiled .
2	i can '_t praise enough and will certainly use linda again as now the fledglings are leaving the nest we can venture on more exotic holidays to suit us .
2	if you are looking for a holiday that needs that extra something then you need a consultant who listens to what you want and doesn_'_t just go through the motions .
2	i would certainly recommend linda_holden of holidays_please
2	batteries were good value , arrived promptly and are working well , so no gripes !
2	excellent service .
2	had an_email reminder that there was medication outstanding on the prescription i had sent previously , so i popped in an order and it was delivered within a couple of days .
2	absolutely fuss - free - wonderful !
2	the worst aftercare i have ever had no help what so ever happy to sell the phone and as soon as it sold they don_'_t want to know never ever will i go in the shop again
2	it '_s not the first time i buy from handtec and they '_ve always delivered products and customer service to great satisfaction .
2	highly_recommended .
2	as title_says really , placed order , sent the phones in 0_days i had the payment in my bank .
2	would use them again anytime .
2	purchased 0 bulbs from led_bulbs .
2	arrived quickly , though only wrapped in a jiffy_bag .
2	one bulb was completely broken .
2	an_email to the company to advise and they swiftly despatched a replacement which once again was only in a jiffy_bag , but not broken so all good .
2	all work fine and leds are the way to go .
2	we '_ve been titmuss customers for over 0 years .
2	our dog has sensitivities and they are always the best price for burns and james welbeloved foods
2	easy to use system great end product .
2	arrived only a few_days after i ordered it .
2	used both an ipad and imac to make the book all good :)
2	this was cheaper_than buying a used one on ebay amazing .
2	the price took my breath away !!!!!
2	!
2	recently got back from the v_festival .
2	tickets ordered from double0 a few_months_ago .
2	they arrived more than two_weeks before the event by registered letter as promised .
2	had a great time and will definitely use double0 again .
2	thanks .

2	i have bought some excellent items from wowcher which were delivered speedily and of good quality .
2	however i have had a problem with one supplier - the beauty challenge who initially failed to deliver any of the 0 items i ordered as xmas_gifts for my 0 kids - then after much chasing delivered three ( which i can '_t use as i need one for each ) - but is now not responding to emails or answering phone_calls about the missing two - i have called repeatedly every day for 00 days .
2	i have emailed wowcher twice - just had an acknowledgement but no action .
2	i then called wowcher on the phone and was told to wait for the other two to arrive as they had been redeemed on different dates - they weren_'_t !
2	am now fed_up waiting - and am thinking i should contact my credit_card company and paypal to dispute the charges unless i get a response .
2	i have not opened the products - but although they are advertised as original selling pice £_00 . 00 - sale price £_00 . 00 they look cheap - and are much smaller_than they appear as advertised .
2	i also suspect they are not mains operated as_described , but won_'_t know until i open .
2	in addition i have spent an exorbitant £_00 . 00 on postage for three featherlight boxes crammed in one a0 envelope .
2	( max £ 0 postage ).
2	update - i received an_immediate_response from wowcher after my review asking me to contact them - which i did .
2	i then received a copy email wowcher sent to the beautychallenge a day or so later - which asked the beauty challenge to contact me .
2	needless to say beautychallenge have not done so - nor have the missing items appeared .
2	i would now like a full_refund - can wowcher confirm how they would like me to do this - given that their merchant does not respond ?
2	i would also like wowcher to say what they propose to do about merchants who fail to honour their commitments and then fail to respond to either the customer or wowcher .
2	i cannot be the only one fleeced in this way - the beauty challenge customer service department answered no phone_calls from any of the various numbers i called from in the 00 days prior to christmas - why was that ?
2	nor did they reply to emails .
2	update
2	heard from wowcher who have now processed my complaint and given me a refund .
2	thank_you to kerry who responded to my last email within 00_hours - i have given three stars because of problem with merchant - but would have given more for wowcher if just rating them - as they did do the decent thing once it became_clear merchant was not going to respond .

2	the fitters were absolutely_brilliant , polite , helpful and friendly .
2	they did a thorough job , clearing up before they left , talked everything through with me .
2	and their office phoned me twice to make_sure everything was ok .
2	i would definitely recommend this company .

2	thanks .
2	good customer service and you are kept_informed at every_stage .

2	this is the only way to get my prescription .

2	we had a fab time in hyde_park .
2	tom was really helpful and very responsive .
2	excellent service would definitely use again .
2	communications and service are always first_class and prices are competitive .
2	i thought that i had been buying through the cheapest method but i found this company and even_though they ' re not well_known , they were great .
2	the package arrived really quickly and it was exactly_what i expected , which can be a worry when trying new companies .
2	it even had a free_returns_label_enclosed just in case i hadn_'_t been happy .
2	i must remember to use them again , rather_than the company i '_m used to using .
2	the lenses were very easy to order and delivery was extremely prompt .
2	there were no_problems and i '_m very satisfied with the service .
2	we rented a car from enterprise via rentalcars at leeds_bradford airport and had an excellent experience overall .

2	we were extremely impressed to get such a good service for a very good price .
2	top_class fashion , i love looking around this site , and i love buying from them even more .
2	great bargains .
2	it has_been 0_weeks since ordered 0 bottles of perfume from this company , i have contacted 0 times , and allowed extra time .
2	yes they responded twice .
2	once to say i am sorry etc , the other time to say when it comes if i do not want them to send back for refund .
2	how can i send back when i still have not received them .
2	i have contacted asking for my money back , and they fail to respond .
2	i have not received the perfume , and it cost me £_00 . 00 i am very disapointed in this company and want a refund of my money .
2	i would avoid this in the future as payment goes quickly , they take days to so called dispatch and i have never received the parcel .
2	i have given this company time to respond and rectify this problem , but they have not .
2	they have no customer service techniques which is very disapointing .
2	if you are reading this half price perfumes , please refund me , you have no right to keep my money !
2	got really quick delivery on bags and they are better quality than ones i have bought before .
2	will definitely use again .
2	i ordered supplements for my dog .. in good time before they ran_out , as i live in the country and cant get to the shops .... they have well ran_out now !!!
2	no answer to my numerous_emails .. tried there online help service ... thats a joke ... and as for tying to get an answer on the phone ... am i sick of hearing ' i '_m sorry ' etc .... will just have to order them from elsewhere and take the financial hit .... lesson_learned .. never use this company ...
2	i just wish i had read these reviews first ..
2	i was a bit_unsure of getting glasses online , but there were no_problems at all , i had just got two_pairs from tesco when i had my eye_test , but i needed tints so thought i would give it a go ... the glasses i recieved fitted better and i had no_probs when shifting from one pair to the other .... wish i could say the same for the expensive tesco ones ...
2	have purchased a very large item before from them and charges were minimal , but they wanted 00_quid to deliver a fairly small item to me , it was only 0 . 00 to get it delivered to glasgow .... i do not live in a remote or island location !
2	!
2	" hay guys , have you been to the national_tyres in cliftonville kent .
2	i have and its great !"

2	i can not fault the team .
2	you should go .

2	very pleased with it , presented in a lovely box and i know he '_ll love it and the contents !
2	thank_you for a great service .
2	always offer great value for money and perfect service .
2	fantastic , ordered fridge_/_freezer 0 . 00_pm and was delivered 00 . 00am next_day , and we live on an island , we cannot get a local shop to beat that ... and we saved 00 %+ on best price local . highly_recommended
2	this is a very good company , the products are first_rate as are the prices , and there are many products on offer so the choice is broad and the delivery time is more than acceptable , order with confidence as they are first_rate
2	“ i would like to say this is a fantastic company to deal with , customer service is excellent !
2	they keep you informed every_step of the way .
2	unfortunately i had a slight_problem with a piece of furniture being damaged but it was dealt_with in a most efficient way the staff were very helpful and explained_everything in detail .

2	i have recommended a friend , and he is keen to use your company purely on my recommendation .
2	thank_you ”
2	would defiantly use mazuma again sent my phone off special delivery they received it the next_day and the money was in my bank that evening !
2	fantastic service
2	i had no trouble_finding what i wanted on the site and was very happy with the price , loads of choice too .
2	definitely worth giving fragrance_direct a go .
2	i ordered a pure radio through go - electrical as they seem to be an_independent and at the same price as john_lewis i decided to support a small business .
2	their website indicated the item was in stock and so i ordered .
2	upon chasing a delivery date i was informed that they were awaiting the item to arrive in stock .
2	i did not receive a response to my subsequent email .
2	bit_disappointing considering the great feedback given through the trust_pilot site .
2	so good any " idiot " can fit them .
2	i was naturally nervous at the prospect of sending the prized possession of my daughter off in the post .
2	no need to worry .
2	communication was great , no_hidden_extras and ipad sent on wednesday was back by friday .
2	i bought this for stand_alone in my studio works well on desk top ,
2	i can now read the screen on the pod , well_worth the money .

2	spot_on and the flowers were amazing !
2	thanks so much
2	i ordered these flowers at the last muinute and they arrived on time and the recipient_loved them
2	i had a parcel that had to be returned to my catalogue , being quite a large parcel it would have cost me £_00 with royalmail , so decided to search online and come_across parcel0go , i wasn_'_t sure how to navigate the sight , but there was a live person there ready to answer my questions , i spoke to robert who was very helpful and made organising collection and delivery of my parcel easy .
2	all in all it cost me less_than £ 0 . 00 and that is also insurance to cover the cost of the parcel if it should get damaged or lost , the price also includes collection from my home , so no_messing_about getting it to the post_office .
2	will_definatley be using this service again .
2	thanks

2	no delivery received .
2	i contacted the company on 0st_november for an update on delivery as it was due for delivery to be told they were not able to get_hold of the go_kart so they would refund my money .
2	then they had the cheek to tell me it would be 00 days for the refund .
2	they have already had my money for over 00 days and now i am having to battle to get it back .
2	i did not cancel the order you breached the contract by failing to provide the goods .
2	i want my money back .
2	i am still_waiting for the refund and have had to go through my credit_card company to try and get my money back do not give this company your business you will be disappointed !!

2	i ordered and had delivered the next_day a hoover wahsing machine & an indesit_fridge_freezer .
2	both came well_wrapped and the delivery men were really helpful .
2	just one thing spoilt the experience .
2	i recieved a call from the warranty team before delivery trying to sell extra warranty on the products purchased .
2	they promised to take away my old appliances for free and ask the delivery driver to contact me half an_hour before to allow me to empty the freezer .
2	non of this ws done .
2	also both appliances came with 0 year free parts waranty as well as the normal 00 months waranty .
2	would use again though .
2	easy to place order .
2	delivered on time and well_wrapped .

2	this is an excellent service .
2	you don_'_t need to keep a drawer full of menus .
2	there are no misunderstandings due to order taker not speaking english as a first language .
2	the orders are processed quickly and if you do have a problem just - eat sort it out straight_away for you .
2	they even rang me when my granddaughter accidently placed the same order twice .
2	the only_drawback is that there are too many choices :)
2	i placed my order quite late on a friday_afternoon and the item was delivered the very next_morning .
2	the postage cost was very reasonable too .
2	can '_t ask for anything more
2	essential_nails are great !

2	after getting no help from parcel_force and a quote for 000_pounds from dhl i tried uship and got a quote immediately .
2	the roofbox has just been delivered by fast000andeasy for 00 pounds !"
2	the whole_process from ordering to delivery were 0_star .
2	easy ordering process , with delivery options to suit everyone .
2	we received update_emails from ao . com , as well as text_messages from the delivery team .
2	the track your order facility was updated every five_minutes .
2	the delivery guys were efficient and polite .
2	i would not_hesitate to recommend ao . com to friends / family , and i would definitely use them again .
2	love these shoes and love the price .
2	will check out shoetique again next time i want a pair of shoes
2	i ordered my winter_tyres and they duly_arrived about a week_later .
2	i had them fitted at my usual tyre retailer / fitter and had them just in time for the arrival of the wintery weather .
2	the tyres have performed verywell in snow and ice and i would reccommend winter_tyres and this company to everyone
2	great service , great prices , would highly_recommend this company , i am more than pleased !
2	highly_recommended
2	i am aged_00 and have been with lcn for several_years .
2	initially my website and hosting was set_up by my son , but as he has now moved away i was faced with the task of creating a new website , domain and hosting package .
2	i was dreading the thought of having to do it all myself and was worried that my business would suffer as a result of my ignorance .
2	my worries were totally_unfounded - the staff at lcn talked_me through every_step of the way and i feel_confident that i now have the knowledge to be able to do everything myself - a great feeling - i do not have to rely_on anyone_else .
2	i cannot thank_you enough lcn .
2	website easy to navigate .
2	have had a few issues with non - delivery and vouchers that don_'_t work but a tesco always put things right with a simple call
2	pay at the click of a button
2	can never be_beaten on price or vast_selection on offer .
2	third_party sellers are less reliable with the service but a quick contact to amazon with any_issues usually does the trick
2	i '_m often seduced by the products offered but invariably disappointed .
2	delivery is often slow and items not always of the best quality .
2	always friendly , polite and helpful .
2	quality products
2	tried boilerjuice for the 0st time .
2	i had just spent 00_mins phoning around all the local suppliers to compare_prices for 000_litres .
2	got the usual " phone back if you get a better price and we will see what we can do ".
2	this really hacks me off , why should i get back to some company that will not give me their best price 0st time ?
2	so i decided to try another way .
2	found bj ' site and ordered through them .
2	they gave_me a price £_00 less_than the best i had been quoted for delivery within 0 working_days , in fact it came in 0 .
2	i will definitely use them again .
2	i cancelled an order 0 hour after_placing it .
2	they still sent the item 0_days_later , numerous_calls / emails later they arranged collection but said i had to pay all carriage_costs .
2	they then denied having received item back .
2	only after complaints to trading_standards and isis did i get a full_refund 0 weeksl later . they do not answer phone_calls or phone back when they say they will , only because i persisted did i get the refund .
2	would never use again .
2	i have used serenataflowers , twice_now - and what an outstanding service !
2	the recipients have said that the flowers were fab - i only hope that one day , i can be the recipient , and see for mysef , how fab they are !!
2	i live in hope :) you are amazing - and i would highly_recommend you to serenata_flowers ...
2	thank_you so much xxxx
2	0_days before xmas , cooker and dishwasher pack up , went on line and found ao . com .
2	ordered the cooker first , was here the next_day .
2	really impressed , they communicated well , arrived when the said they would , lovely , helpful guys .
2	connected cooker , reviews were correct and helpful .
2	it exceeded out expectations .
2	so when the dishwasher went , we ordered from there again and it arrived late at night through that awful storm .
2	the guys were helpful and cheerful throughout , both appliances are efficient , quiet and as_described .
2	great service and highly_recommend this company .
2	found this company on the internet when vet_bills became extortionate , have used them over the last_year , and having 0 elderly cats on medication as well as specialized food i save over half on buying from medicanimal . com .
2	i would highly_recommend this company for their courteous_manner , helpfulness , and easy website when ordering .
2	keep_up the good work !!!!!!
2	!
2	i would highly_recommend printerland , the staff are always hepful and knowledgeable and advised me of the best printers for different situations .
2	the aftersales service is just as good and delivery of printers is very quick and toner usually_arrives the next_day !
2	the price is also excellent and the website easy to use .
2	it is good to still find a company that cares_about its customers .
2	really good service - have used viovet for several_years for dog_food , toys , bedding and medications , both prescription and non - prescription .
2	well_organised , usually cheapest and quick to respond .
2	keep you informed of the progress of your order .
2	on the one occasion when the goods weren_'_t packed intelligently and therefore arrived in a very messy state , i received a prompt apology and voucher for £ 0 .
2	wouldn_'_t use anyone_else .
2	very helpful company , contacting me to check i had completed my prescription details correctly and checking distance requirements for screen - use glasses .
2	would definitely recommend .
2	i '_ve_used misco quite a bit for various business purchases including laser cartridges and digital cartridges .
2	always get great service , and our customer rep , katriona , always looks for the best deals available to us and suggests alternatives .
2	saw the gadget_show on monday before christmas and googled their no .
2	0 grippy boots directly after the show , ordered them online from outdoorkit on monday_night , they were posted with a tracking_number via_email on tuesday and arrived wednesday - couldn_'_t be better .
2	would definitely recommend outdoorkit to anyone .
2	price of the boots was also nearly_£_00 cheaper_than the same thing from numerous sellers on ebay !
2	i returned to black_circles & spire garage to have my tyres_fitted .
2	both excellent service & highly_recommended
2	you can find products on this site that no one else carries .
2	combine the availability of variety with great prices and you can safely say , " they got it all !"
2	good price and excellent service .
2	arrived on time .
2	very convenient service .
2	only one slight_problem , my bmw metal dust cap was not put on the new tyre but a nasty plastic one .
2	quick delivery and first_class communication .
2	purchased evergreen complete for a very good price .
2	cheapest i could find which included the £ 0 delivery charge .
2	highly_recommended .
2	very pleased with lulu stools .
2	problem with one was quickly sorted_out and replacement part dispatched .
2	good value for money and very fast delivery .
2	paid for items 00st_december for delivery mid_january .
2	goods didn_'_t arrive so emailed them to be told delivery now 0st_march .
2	once again no goods and then told over the phone deliver end of march .
2	i have now cancelled order as they have had my money for over 0_weeks .
2	no correspondence from them at any stage of this saga and no apology just some rubbish about chinese new year .
2	they should not be taking customers money , making promises that the delivery date would not be changed again only to let you down once more .
2	will never shop_here again .
2	interesting enough it seems to me most reviews on here are by people who have only written one review in the past .
2	wish i had noticed this before ordering .
2	thank_you for your reply .
2	i have never received any emails saying i would have to wait 0_months or that the delivery date had changed 0 times .
2	i understand that you have had supply problems but the chinese new year has not lasted for three two months plus .
2	thank_you for the refund .
2	i have ordered elsewhere and they are arriving tomorrow .
2	just so disappointed i have waited all this time and given you the benefit of the doubt .
2	ordering was easy with great range of products .
2	free delivery and returns which is an added_bonus .
2	i did return some items which didnt fit and they emailed me to say they had received which was good .
2	i would highly_recommend this company as very efficient and good prices .
2	booked on a thursday_evening for fitting of 0 new tyres the next_day .
2	the fitter kept me informed as to when he would arrive .
2	just after midday my tyres were fitted .
2	unbelievably fast service at a good price .
2	added_bonus not having to leave home and wait in a draughty tyre_centre .
2	will be remembering these_guys when anyone in the family needs new tyres .
2	always pleased with the products ordered .
2	great prices and fast delivery .
2	would highly_recommended .
2	goods not received .
2	rang twice and told it was going out today .
2	ended_up cancelling order .
2	no communication received from them .
2	no apology and their attitude is one of couldn_'_t care less .
2	keeping my fingers_crossed where my refund is concerned .
2	would not shop_here again .
2	this company will not make it in the internet_shopping world with this level of service .
2	shop elsewhere .
2	easy ordering and fast delivery .
2	very pleased with my purchase .
2	excellent price and fast delivery .
2	will shop_here again .
2	even_though i provided all the requested information i have still not received my cash_back from october_0000 .
2	no reply to my further emails .
2	case is still pending on top_cash_back as they havent_heard_anything from go_electrical .
2	this company should not advertise on cash_back web_sites if they have not intention of paying .
2	dewalt dt0000 00 pce reciprocating recip saw blades set .
2	quick delivery , good product and great value for money .
2	would recommend and use again .
2	pleased with item , super_fast delivery .
2	would use again .
2	this company offers a very good selection of products at good prices .
2	i waited three_weeks for delivery but hope thats just a one off .
2	if you are running_low order well in_advance taking into account you might not receive in time .
2	would like to see a better service where you are advised without asking that your order has_been delayed_due to stock .
2	would use again though .
2	have used many_times and they are always reliable .
2	good prices and will certainly check their web_site for anything i need .
2	keep_up the good work .
2	wish i had read this review site before dealing_with this company .
2	i will not bore readers with all the details as its pretty_much what previous_reviews have said .
2	all i will add is that returns are not £ 0 . 00 .
2	their returns_label does not include postage_costs so you foot the bill .
2	plus they deduct the £ 0 . 00 from your refund even_though i sent proof of postage .
2	in total it cost me £_00 . 00 in postage to send back poor quality dresses .
2	i would give no stars to this company if possible as their customer service is awful , they ignore your questions and queries and only answer what suits them .
2	no phone number which is very convenient for them , although i guess you would never get through with the number of complaints they must receive .
2	i have sent 0 emails and am awaiting a reply , which i suspect i either wont get or they will ignore the content .
2	i will be reporting this company to trading_standards as very false_advertising and statements are made on their web_site .
2	do not buy from this company as you will regret it .
2	havent used the tool yet but delivery was fast as promised .
2	great service
2	fast delivery .
2	very pleased with product .
2	dont order flowers from serenta go to your local_supermarket you would get better flowers for less money there
2	i was informed every_step of the way of the progress of my order .
2	my sister was delighted with the flowers .
2	excellent overall .
2	thank_you .
2	the item i purchased was dispatched quickly and received the next_day .
2	i cant_fault the service i received and the product that i had found difficult to source elswhere was in stock and at an excellent price .
2	excellent quality product and good promt service .
2	bought a fan from hi -_fi and am really pleased with it .
2	it was easy to assemble and really whacks out the air without being noisy at all - in fact , we '_ve only had to have it on the first setting so far !
2	would definitely buy from this company again .
2	they provide excellent service and quality products .
2	i love these_guys , i had quotes really quickly all for free and i was able to organise collection for my item from ebay for a really reasonable_price and i will be more than pleased to opt for them everytime from now on !
2	they kept me up to date by txts from the driver !
2	changing dog_food for my giant breed and changing online companies , sifting_through all the blurb on the net , i came_across viovet who promoted quick delivery and reasonable_prices .
2	they definitely ticked all the boxes and was delivered within 0_days to my door , best packaging so no room to get damaged .
2	will be dealing_with them again in the very near_future .
2	thank_you .
2	i '_ve been ordering for well over a year now every 0_months to replenish dog_food for my large dog and other bits and pieces for her and 0 cats .
2	always received within 0 - 0_days and only once missed a fur brush which was sent the next_day ( due to low stock at time ).
2	tried other_companies before .
2	petplanet is on such a large scale , slip ups must happen , not intentionally but if they continue with well_trained_staff ( always polite on phone ) they will_continue to always be the best .
2	after being informed that my delivery would be with me between 0 & 0 on a monday , which in my opinion is unacceptable in this day and age to expect the customer to hang_around all day , regardless of work commitment , to await a delivery which does not materialise , i waited_until the thursday , when a battered and water_damaged item arrived , i received no communication whatsoever from uk mail to advise me of even what day my parcel was arriving , the item after being dropped several_times by a driver who was very rude arrived damaged and had to be sent back , this being the 0nd damaged item i have received via this courier firm , not impressed in the least with this company
2	i would recommend to all my family and friends , excellent service and kept_updated of progress of delivery .
2	hi
2	i booked a courier on line today i was nervous but it was so easy .
2	i didn_'_t have a road name as it '_s going to a friend on a farm but had a live_chat with lovely sarah_hayes she was really helpful .
2	it was half the cost of the post_office so will definitely be using again for all my parcels , and it '_s evenvbeing picked_up .
2	a great service all_round .

2	having used my savings to replace a boiler , was pleased that key were so helpful in replacing my account balance by recommending aviva equity_release which although not offering the best percentage for amount borrowed did have the lowest rate available . your rep tony_pummell was hugely helpful and was available if i needed any_problems cleared up .

2	i am writing to say how impressed i was with the service provided by dpd .
2	i was advised of the delivery date the day before and on the day received an_email_informing_me of the delivery time - i only had to be in for 0 hour , not all day , which was really refreshing !
2	the parcel duly_arrived in the allocated time_slot .
2	i would thoroughly_recommend dpd to other_users .
2	i emailed customer service with a print cartridge issue .

2	animed_direct was selling this product at a great price and with free delivery !
2	ordered one day and received the next - excellent service and would recommend anyone to check their site out .
2	what a find appliances_online has_been .
2	one of my best buying experiences ever from finding my preferred product on their website at an extremely competitive price , to the easy order and payment process .
2	i particularly_liked the options for delivery , not to mention the several texts / messages received and online tracking to give me the 0 hour time_slot for arrival of my goods .

2	the chaps that came with the delivery van were also very pleasant , courteous and efficient and had my new product unpacked and old product removed from the premises in a matter of very few_minutes .

2	perfect_fit , looks good , recommend
2	we ordered day invitations , evening_invitations , service sheets and personalised name cards .
2	each order was delivered very promptly , it was very easy to talk to somebody about any query , the company contacted me when they noticed an_error . i would thoroughly_recommend this company .
2	thank_you so much .
2	racking seems ok but :-
2	first lot of shelves - some the wrong depth and all damaged by courier .
2	second lot of shelves - not damaged but still some wrong_size .
2	had to get my carpenter to cut down .
2	cheaper_than getting him to come_back yet another day .
2	big_dug gave_us a small credit towards this inconvenience .
2	we are a busy doctors practice .
2	we ordered a laser fax at an excellent price & free next_day delivery .
2	the extra toner was price matched too .
2	excellent .
2	will be back .
2	what a friendly company - superb service with a flourish of good humour , thank_you so much guys !
2	i was expecting the goods to be cheap and cheerful but was amazed_at the quality which is better_than some iv ' e paid a lot more for , will be using this site again and also highly recommending it .
2	things cost a little more but only to be expected when they are delivered to your door and very quickly i will be definitely be using them again and recommend them to others .
2	i bought a pair of walking_boots , which were £_00 cheaper_than_anywhere_else . i wanted them delivered to my work place but put the wrong number on the address .
2	they were happy to change my details ( it didn_'_t seem a problem ) and they were delivered the next_day .
2	friendly and a real can do attitude ... this is what customer service should be like .
2	i have been with kandco for over 00 years and yes i have had a few problems but these have always been sorted .
2	i mainly shop for clothing and the quality and choice is good .
2	i have had another catalogue and have found that they have gone " very older lady " and the prices for the same type of items are a lot dearer_than kandco .
2	i might be an " older lady " but i like to be up to date ( not " mutton ") with my clothing , especially workwear
2	i had no_problems with ordering what i required and if i tried to order over the amount allowed i was prompted with a message_stating the amount i could order .
2	the items were ordered on the sunday and delivered by tuesday which was great .
2	the prices were good too .
2	looking at the prices before i ordered i worked that even if i ordered one item and added the postage it was still cheaper_than buying from a chemists .
2	i was after a rear passenger_seat for my car .
2	i entered the details of my car and within 0 minutes i was receiving quotes from salvage companies .
2	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to use them again
2	excellent customer service .
2	fast shipping .
2	best online buying experience by far .
2	our plumber said they were brilliant quality ... we told him the price ... and he said he couldn_'_t get them for anywhere_near that price !!
2	i would recommend to anyone who will listen
2	i bought a second_hand iphone_0gs and it was in a sorry_state indeed .
2	i trawled_through most of the internet sites that offered iphone repairs .
2	i wanted so much work to be carried_out - new screen , battery , rear case , missing volume control and a few bits more .
2	iphone_surgery came out on top as they were offering a full rerfurbishment which was a lot_cheaper_than other_companies .
2	their website is very straightforward to use and i was emailed to let_me know what was happening throughout the whole_process .
2	i posted the mobile late_afternoon on wednesday and had it back in my hand by friday_morning .
2	it looks absolutely_stunning - just like brand_new .
2	i am so pleased with it .
2	i shall be recommending iphone_surgery without_question .
2	gave_me a timeframe to unlock my iphone_0s .
2	they explained how it would all work and kept me informed all down the line .
2	they emaile to let_me know the phone was unlocked and gave concise_instructions to complete the unlock on itunes .
2	all worked_perfectly
2	fab website , easy to use .
2	ordered flowers at 0pm and they were delivered by 0 pm same day .
2	they look stunning and apparently they smell_divine too .
2	half the tv in the seats didnt work , no vegan option for food , a 00 hour flight with no food ....... come on ... it dont take much to cater for veggies and vegans these days
2	they sold a laptop to my friend who is blind , he had special software to help him use the machine until the hard_disk died .
2	although the laptop had on site warranty , they refused to send someone out .
2	the asked him to dismantle the laptop ( something most people with full vision would struggle with ) to check the hard_disk , when told he was blind they still refused to honour the onsite warranty until this proceedure had been carried_out
2	bought 0 items from amazon over 0_days , the delivery companies they use govern when or if we receive the item , home delivery network are a useless buch of scruffy oiks that lie on the delivery sheet , turn_up if an when they feel like it , and faced with a 000mtr dive up the lane to my house would rather mark the item undeliverable and send it back .
2	amazon issues a refund then emails you to say if you still want the item then you have to re - order it .... hello muppets >>>> thats_why i ordered it in the first place .... wont order from amazon again as if i order on line i expect it to be delivered
2	i did order with another on line shop and had it delivered next_day
2	should have a negative star system one star is far too generous for these amazonian muppets
2	website was easy to navigate and found what we wanted with no_hassle , delivery arranged and patiently_waited .
2	delivery driver could not be bothered to open our gate so he threw the mattress over the gate , i fell over during the 0_days it was left to the elements behind a skip so we could not see it , only when about to leave the farm did we notice a very soggy package .
2	good job that mattressman had packed it really well so no damage done .
2	shame a shoddy delivery company can marr the merits of a good company .
2	would not use them again due to delivery company attitude , driver even lied on his delivery sheet saying " he was told to leave it by the gate ".
2	i am pleased i got in touch with age_partnership , i received a better return on my annuity and i was kept_informed at all times during the process .
2	i could not fault the service provided .
2	000000
2	i was advised my order would be received within 0 working_days , i actually received it within 0_days , very pleased indeed , as i was out parcel left in safe_place and note left , excellent !
2	very reasonable_prices , good choice of products with information , well_packaged and arrive in good time .
2	would definitely recommend this firm .
2	very happy with all my purchases from pet_supermarket , delivery is always swift and they are great on price too .
2	would recommend to all pet_owners .
2	ordered on friday and delivered on monday , very good price and speedy , problem free delivery , very impressed and will use this company again .
2	new car ( 0000 miles ) in excellent condition .
2	staff very friendly , helpful and fast .
2	good quality / price ratio .
2	nearly bought our fridge_freezer locally but it was out of stock .
2	thank_goodness it was .
2	found it on ao eighty pounds_cheaper .
2	prompt delivery with online tracking .
2	and two very helpful delivety men .
2	well_done ao !
2	bought a mini speaker from them .
2	just about to go back online and order a second as its lovely quality , reasonable , and can be used in series with others .
2	good service , prompt delivery and prices good .
2	recommend them .
2	well_done mobilefun !
2	found the site more than useful and plenty of variety to choose from will use this site again
2	ordered a few different items , it was quickly delivered and i was kept_informed and the date was spot_on .... very pleased .
2	would certainly order again - excellent service and great prices .
2	i have ordered twice_now from this company and found them to be really good .
2	i recommended them to a friend who also ordered a while ago and she was very happy as well .
2	information , advice , anything i needed - they responded .
2	they could have taken more money from me but their advice saved me money .
2	would highly_recommend them .
2	their prices are very competitive as well !
2	easy to use and have always been very good - even when i make the mistake !
2	daniel and emma - 0 of their live help agents i had to ask help of today
2	and both were good and sorted me out .
2	the only_thing is i would have liked to have linked ebay with them and be able to use the drop_off service instead .
2	please read this honest account of my problems
2	after checking out previous_reviews and visiting the showroom we decided to go to one place to order everything as being disabled my hubby thought it would be easier although somethings were more_expensive despite_being on sale ...
2	how wrong can you be or am i just very unlucky ?
2	paid_extra on top of delivery charges for delivery on a certain day because we were going away while bathroom being done with me being disabled .
2	day 0 - half the order arrived and one pallet was damaged - and had been cobbled together with odds pieces of wood and huge nails sticking out - all the items were damaged very noticeably .
2	why did it leave the warehouse in that condition ?
2	after numerous phone_calls which nobody returned despite promising an_hour ... eventually ( after having to scan in my delivery note copy re damaged and missing items and email it to prove it as delivery company said nothing reported !)
2	the rest of order and replacements items were sorted_out in the nick of time and promised next_day ... items delivered seemed okay except one item missing - nothing important just the shower_cubicle
2	next_day after phone_calls again the shower_cubicle arrived - on a pallet huge and secured - on my own and disabled and driver left it on pallet ( just like other goods ) on my front - no noticeable damage at this time .
2	had to go away - fitter found a hole in bottom of shower_cubicle box when he lifted it off the pallet with glass pieces trickling out - photographed it and rang and to ask about returning easy plumb tray - told to ring back monday - went through rigmoroll again and eventually the following friday another cubicle delivered .
2	all this and on top not been able to return the easy plumb kit for a refund that was not used but we did not know until too late because of delays caused by the company .
2	all in all a thoroughly horrendous_experience .
2	company did agree to a short_term credit_note to exchange the easy plumb kit but seeing as they do not have much to exchange for having purchased everything else i needed am a bit stuck and credit will only last a couple of weeks provided i can get it back to the warehouse within a deadline ...
2	the customer service lady was quite good but no - one else has_been in touch and i have been told policy is policy ....
2	i just hope to goodness we do not have any_problems with the goods once installed as it does not forebear well with the experience i have had so far .
2	so - check everything in minute detail - record everything - and be very quick about it and make_sure you return everything broken with the driver .
2	if you do as the company suggests and get stuff delivered before you get a date for fitting then check everything and thoroughly - do not wait for your fitter and if you are disabled then get some strong men to be there for delivery and check it for you .
2	do not trust that the box seems okay so the goods must be !
2	i am very very stressed about the whole_thing and i certainly cannot recommend this company .
2	one thing broken or missing in a large order - perhaps , but not this much_trouble .
2	addition 0 . 00 . 00
2	another huge joke - the agreement states exchanges within 00days yet i was told a different tale when i asked about exchanging something saying i only had another 0_days for an exchange and they then only hold the credit for 0_weeks or i would lose it all , despite_being away on holiday and being disabled which is why we were going away while the bathroom was being fitted .
2	the item was the 0nd time it was delivered ( first one broken ) and it was finally delivered again with no box within a pallet of cling filmed other goods - i was as good as called a liar by the warehouse in that they never ever send out unboxed goods when i invited him to comment on our other problems ...
2	they never ever break anything and that my goods were never missing - nothing ever went wrong in his warehouse !
2	please_please be aware of this disasterous company
2	there were 0 people queing to complain when we were there and also when my fitter had to go to pick something up they never bothered to tell us was necessary he was also in a queue of complaints .
2	when i invisted customer service agent to pass on my complaint to a manager and either speak to me or email his comments i was told
2	" unfortunately a manger isn_’_t going to advise you any different , this is a company policy and we all abide by the same rules ."
2	so no - one cares at all .
2	i have a faulty tap and no_doubt i will get nowhere with that !
2	i am very angry , very tearful and bitterely dissapointed in their disinterest and complete disregard of customer_satisfaction once your money is taken .
2	very impressed with the service i have received from denney_diving .
2	placed my order on a sunday , received a phone_call on the tuesday advising me that unfortunately the item i had ordered was nowhere to be found !
2	discussed sizing of said order and a smaller_size was recommended based on my description of my other half .
2	on mentioning that i was also interested in purchasing a new scuba wetsuit and would decide once i had seen my partner '_s , chris said he would send one out in my size without taking payment so i could try it on for size first !!
2	brilliant !!
2	what other company would ever do that !
2	both wetsuits arrived within 00_hours as chris said they would ; mine was perfect but had to return my partner '_s as he preferred a larger_size .
2	spoke with chris again and said i would be returning and he said he would search for the larger_size or try and source another one at the same price and send out to me .
2	again , so friendly and knowledgeable about sizing and fit etc , will definitely use denney_diving again for further_purchases in the future .
2	very very impressed !
2	decided to try ilumi products after_reading a review about them in my women '_s fitness magazine .
2	i am not coealic ; lactose_intolerant or suffer with any other allergies ; but like to take to work more than just a sandwich sometimes and for health & fitness reasons , try to reduce my intake of wheat based products as i find i do suffer with bloatedness .
2	and when it '_s freezing outside , i sometimes need more than a salad !!
2	delivery of my products was within 0_days which was great and the website was very good with their descriptions of the products .
2	so far i have had the za ' atar chicken ; the chilli_con carne ; the spanish style rice & vegetables and the pea , pancetta & mint soup ; and they have all been absolutely_delicious !
2	i love that the instructions for cooking are on the front of the packaging ; everything tastes homemade and are perfectly portioned for one person .
2	i look_forward to coming home to try my next meal and can '_t wait to place my next order !
2	!
2	ordered online on the 00th_december for delivery to a collect_plus location the next_day .
2	received email with tracking_number stating goods had been despatched .
2	tracked parcel the next_day ( 00th_dec ) which was the delivery due day and delivery site just said goods in transit !
2	tracked parcel the day after ( 00th_dec ) to find that the goods had been refused by addressee and returned to sender !!
2	checked with my collect_plus store to find out why goods had been refused to find out that no deliveries had been attempted in my name !
2	i have a lot of parcels go to this collect_plus store and the owner said he would not have refused a parcel in my name as he knows me !
2	emailed superdry customer service to let them know ( 00th_dec ) and request a replacement immediately as this was required for an xmas_present , and to date i have received no goods and had no reply !!
2	i am not impressed !
2	have used serenata a few_times_now and they are consistently good and very reliable .
2	the bouquets ordered and delivered have always been of a very high_standard !
2	competitively_priced too !
2	i don_'_t think you can beat this website for flower delivery .
2	absolutely_brilliant service from this store , especially anish , the sales_assistant who dealt_with our purchase of two road race bikes .
2	my partner has ridden road bikes before and had an idea of what he was looking for , but for myself having never ridden a road race bike before , i did feel slightly out of my depth , but anish made me feel comfortable right from the outset .
2	he recommended their bike fitting service to find out my body measurements and which type of road_bike would have the best geometry to suit me best .
2	having done that he narrowed the choice down to one bike and then spent the time adjusting the display_model to fit my measurements .
2	this service has a price of £_00 , which is refunded if you then buy the bike from sigma_sport .
2	a small price to pay to get a road race bike perfectly suited for your frame and measurements .
2	the bike i tried was slightly too_big a frame for me , but he ordered one into the store for me to try with no_obligation to buy if i did not like it .
2	my partner was so impressed with the service , he too decided to pay for the bike fitting service , and was delighted with the bike he bought .
2	we ended_up paying slightly more for the bikes than we had originally budgeted for , but are both so pleased with what we have , as they are comfortable to ride straight_away with minimal adjustments , that we would recommend sigma_sport to anyone looking to buy their first road race bike .
2	you would not want to go_anywhere_else after going there either .
2	their service is second to none and their knowledge and expertise is brilliant .
2	they are not pushy in any way and certainly go that one step further to make the experience of spending what can be a lot of money more enjoyable !!
2	five_star service !
2	was recommended the myprotein site by a young holland &_barrett assistant who told me he gets all his products from them .
2	rang up their customer_services first to check on some of the ingredients in one of the protein_shakes and found the customer service agent to be extremely_helpful and even helped_me with my first order .
2	this was delivered within three_days so very impressed with the quickness .
2	have since placed another order online and again spoke with someone_else about the product i was ordering , who again was extremely_helpful and knowledgeable .
2	will be ordering all my nutritional_supplements from this site in future .
2	quick and simple to use - within 0 minutes i had a quote , accepted it and received a confirmation_email !!
2	brilliant site .
2	registered online ; 0_days letter envelope arrived with instructions ; sent it off ; next_day email received saying money had been paid straight_into account .
2	fantastic service and so easy and stress_free .
2	the delivery of the runner was very speedy and was exactly_what i had ordered .
2	i '_m very pleased with the carpet and am thinking of ordering more for other areas of the house .
2	the product arrived quickly and efficiently and was competitively_priced .
2	well_done viovet .
2	it is so nice to find a free site that has no restrictions and some really nice people to chat to
2	they have a huge_variety and everything has a great description so you know what you are getting .
2	the prices are great and they even do price matching .
2	shipping is fair too .
2	i wouldn_'_t of known which nutrition bar to buy for our son '_s platoon in boot camp if it wasn_'_t for their descriptions .
2	the amount offered for my phones was really good .
2	the envelope was sent through super quick and the payment was put into my account amazingly fast .
2	i am nothing but impressed with mazuma .
2	thank_you .
2	easy ordering , fast delivery
2	firstly i had to chase my order .
2	secondly i returned my item , 0_months later i still_haven_'_t received a refund .
2	they haven_'_t logged off my return so even_though i have proof of return i am still without a refund !!!!!!
2	firstly i '_m told i need to make a claim from the po when it was their postage_label i used then i '_m told that i should take it up with my credit_card company !!!!!
2	what !!!!!!!
2	are you mad !!!!!!!!
2	any other company i have dealt_with sees a pop and promptly refunds customer !
2	the company then takes it up with the po not the other way around !!!!!!!!!
2	!
2	customer service is dire , emails aren_'_t answered , phone_calls are pretty_pointless !
2	well if this sees the light of day i '_ll be suprised but no matter the www .
2	is a great way to air ones grievances !
2	i needed insurance for my iphone0s at it is worth a lot of money and it would be a disaster if anything happens to it , so i '_ve been anxious all the time when out with it .
2	however , insurance was too expensive for our limited monthly budget - until now .
2	i saw this company on martins_money saving newsletter i signed_up to weekly for good deals .
2	this was so easy to sign up to and i will have full cover and therefore peace of mind for an affordable monthly direct_debit .
2	so far so good ...
2	we are on a tight_budget and wanted a nice hotel for a combination of my birthday and 0st wedding_anniversary weekend specifically in poole dorset where we loved it during a day trip .
2	the site is really clear , the deal is amazing - literally on £_00 more than a caravan hire for the same 0_days , and near the seafront .
2	we also get a free full breakfast and i was able to put a note in about me being a vegetarian , and free wifi so we will be able to use our iphones via the wifi there too , an added_bonus !
2	also the icing_on the cake ( no pun_intended re the birthday ) is that we don_'_t have the money right now but as we can pay when there so we can save up monthly now but definitely still have our booking to look_forward to .
2	i am a very happy person indeed .
2	i found this company online as the one i was using was charging a lot of posting and packing and often didn_'_t have what i wanted in stock .
2	they had everything i wanted , didn_'_t charge loads of p_&_p , and it arrived promptly .
2	i will be continuing to use them .
2	this is an easy and fun purchase and the vendor will do all they can to help if there are problems .
2	and who would not love to have a title !!
2	my husband and i are very happy to be lord and lady and it was a lovely gift for us to share for our anniversary
2	i regularly order a number of products from simply_supplements and am always very pleased with the quality of the products , the service and the speed of delivery .
2	the goods arrive well_packed and in good order .
2	i would willingly recommend them to anyone .
2	having never used a firm like this was a bit_wary , got a lot of quotes from different firms , will use this site again it saved me a lot of phone_calls
2	i use amazon a lot and they are very competitively_priced and delivery is usually very good .
2	only anti_virus i '_ve ever used and never had any_problems
2	just set_up and let it do it '_s thing , no_worries
2	animed provides a fast and efficient service at a great price . i would recommend it to everyone
2	item ordered and delivered in less_than 00_hours . could not provide a better service . would recommend
2	i find the fact i purchased my mobile and they didnt give me my cashback i should have earnt they are obviously very decietful they promise something and give you nothing and before they try to say i didnt buy the phone i have the reciept for £_00 . 00 and the phone i will not be using this company again and will be advising friends and family against it
2	quality goods , beautiful packaging and excellent fast service .
2	bought a motorola pro plus £_000 .
2	.
2	.
2	. bargain !!!
2	and got it next_day
2	thank_you
2	xxxxxxx
2	vary impressed with this company
2	really good quality glasses at a fantastic price
2	i bought a dab_radio from go - electrical .
2	after three_months , the software scrambled .
2	the company agreed to replace it straight_away - no suggestion of sending it back for repair .
2	very good service !
2	if i could give no stars , i would .
2	my story is very similar to paul and dawn below .
2	i ordered on may 0nd and didn_'_t receive my summer house until july .
2	they constantly blamed shires , who make them .
2	mine had a b_& q sticker on it when it arrived !
2	they told me " squires hadn_'_t picked_up the order " when i rang to ask where it was .
2	even after that , the order wasn_'_t fed through .
2	as they take the money the moment you make the order , i think they make their profit on the interest rather_than selling garden_buildings .
2	when it arrived , one of the gables was damaged .
2	i '_m trying to get_hold of squires but will probably resort to getting it repaired locally .
2	i think they assume we will give up if we get no response .
2	it '_s all very dispiriting !
2	i really hope this company - parcels0go - carry on finding such reasonable rates for its european service .
2	each time i have used their service it has all worked_perfectly .
2	my parcels are collected on time and delivered on time .
2	all employers work hard to make the process work , many_thanks to peter_chandler .
2	keep_up the good work and i will carry on using your service .
2	excellent sheer tights and very generously_sized ... will_definately be back for more !
2	they arrived very quickly
2	slim & save are just fabulous .
2	they offer a huge_range of choice in flavours and textures .
2	the bars are yummy and it '_s great to have savory as well as sweet .
2	the mousse mix is brilliant and make a nice change to a shake .
2	the postal service is brilliant .
2	it '_s mostly next_day and i even get a text to give me an_hour_window of arrival .
2	can '_t complain_about that .
2	the forum also gives a huge_amount of support
2	shopped for tyres here and found them at a great reduction .
2	the centre neatest me was only 00_minutes away .
2	it was easy to book and only took 00mins .
2	brilliant .
2	great company .
2	competitive on price , easy to use and postage .
2	will definitely be back .
2	delivery was really fast , and i was kept up to date with emails .
2	the packaging was great and my prodect was perfect .
2	it was the cheapest price , and a fantastic way to shop !
2	will_definately use again .....
2	i ordered 0 cards one for brother and one for uncle , and ticked the box on both to ask for them to be sent direct to my brother .
2	the site is obviously not user_friendly as one card was sent to my brother and the other back to me .
2	when the card i received arrived it was just in one envelope addressed to me and i have had to cross out my name and address and then use another envelope to send to my brother .
2	i had to go out specially and buy a stamp and post the card which will now arrive late .
2	i have never had problems in the past but it seems that hallmark are cutting back on costs .
2	they are also impossible to reach by phone or email - still_awaiting a reply .
2	i will not use them again , and would warn you of the problems so that you don_'_t have to go to this trouble .
2	this is the first time in 00 years that my brother has not received a card from me .
2	hallmark made responded following this complaint and apologised and refunded my money .
2	i was happy with this and will try ordering another card in the future and give them a second chance
2	i have used the whisky_exchange several_times and will certainly be using many more times in the future .
2	there is a very good selection with prices to suit everyone .
2	the delivery was very quick and the items all packaged very well .
2	well_done .
2	as always we leave our orders until the last_minute but the next_day service does exactly_what it says .
2	customer service is probably mor e important to me than price - although the prices are very competitive as well
2	very punctual in sending your goods out .
2	n good in returning items back 00 / 00
2	i ordered a small bookcase last_week .
2	i was slightly_apprehensive , as i '_ve never ordered furniture online before , but it seemed to be just what i was looking for .
2	the fact that it wasn_'_t flat_pack and had free delivery was a bonus !
2	it arrived on friday and i certainly wasn_'_t disappointed .
2	it '_s well made and finishes off my livingroom beautifully .
2	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to use pinesolutions again .
2	simple to order , unbelievably fast turn_around .
2	just what i needed at a reasonable_price .
2	i ordered a north_face gilet for my son for christmas , on calling to check stock was available i was assured it would arrive thee next_day , even on standard service if i placed the order before 0pm .
2	fantastic and parcelforce delivered the next_day .
2	the gilet is lovely , i had researched the product on line and allweathers offered the most competitive price .
2	will use this site again .
2	thank_you very much .
2	i booked a parcel for delivery to france and wasn_'_t able to book it to drop_off at my local parcelshop so i used the chat_facility for the first time and it was just brilliant !
2	no need for 0000 numbers , it '_s totally free and verrrrrrry helpful .
2	i spoke to [_name_] and he promptly changed my delivery for me and made it so i could drop it off myself ready for collection , emailing me the new labels .
2	what a brilliant idea the live_chat is , works so well and as i said ......... it '_s free :))))
2	thanks to it and [_name_] i don_'_t have to stay in waiting for the courier to arrive , it '_s all goooood !
2	!
2	this is a great bingo site to play on .
2	friendly chat_hosts and good chances to win .
2	working with ditto has always been a pleasure .
2	from our first meeting i knew they were a company who worked hard to provide high_quality and well_designed products .
2	they listen to their clients and work hard to achieve our vision but more than that they make magic with their designs and give you something you could never have dreamed up yourself .
2	they are the friendliest group of people and it is a great comfort to know that they are working hard to help your business or event be a success .
2	from ditto you get amazing designs , excellent quality , and the friendly relaxed_atmosphere of their business is second to none .
2	cannot_praise them enough .

2	i mucked_up the oprder in a stupid way .
2	the team at toolstop were polite and helpful .
2	they sorted_out the issue with a minimum of fuss and a maximum tolerance for stupidity .
2	customer service by email , live_chat and on the phone was excellent .
2	they let_me return the wrong item and resupplied the correct tool with good humour and were helpful throughout .
2	i have been using dotmailer for 00 years and can '_t rate it highly_enough .
2	over the years the tool has grown to keep_up with new email developments , integrated with social_media and allowed increasingly complex segmentation and personalisation .
2	the system is very reliable , there is rarely unplanned downtime , they give plenty of notice of system upgrades , and the system developments get covered quickly in the training manuals and webinars .
2	the support is excellent and the acount managers are helpful and friendly .
2	the set_up costs and monthly send costs are competative with the other email system providers given the enterprise level tool you get .
2	happy to speak to anyone , potential customer or white label , who_wants to discuss ...
2	ordered part monday_morning , arrived first thing tuesday very happy indeed .
2	would recommend !
2	medic_animal have great prices , ordering is simple , their delivery service is excellent , they are a pleasure to deal with .
2	ordering is easy , prices are good , flowers of good quality , your kept_informed every_step of the way , and told when delivery has taken place , they take the hard_work and worry out of the procedure for you .
2	web_site easy to us , have a wide_range of products , prices very competitive , quick delivery , what more could you want .
2	very quick delivery which was included in cost of order .
2	none of this ' buy with us at good prices but oh we charge £ 0 for delivery .'
2	type of thing .
2	well_packaged .
2	good price .
2	highly_recommend .
2	i ordered two_pairs of glasses on a special promotion in december_0000 .
2	i didn_'_t have my new prescription but i added it later .
2	initially there was some mix - up and the fulfillment of my order was delayed and i did have to chase it but at every_stage the personnel were helpful .
2	i subsequently ordered another pair of varifocal_glasses and these arrived before the order for the standard lense specs but it was all under_control .
2	when the standard lense specs arrived there seemed to be a problem with the prescription as they weren_'_t that much different to my ordinary eyesight .
2	it transpired_that i had stated a preference for ' reading ' glasses for computer use when what i wanted was standard lenses for distance ( and reading ).
2	i had ordered the varifocal for the specific computer use requirements .
2	my first experience with varifocals by the way and i am very pleased .
2	when i contacted gd about the weak lenses on the original order they spotted the ' mistake ' and offered to reglaze the lenses for me and this was done with no_hassle .
2	this is what i consider good service .
2	and i was kept_informed by phone and email at all times .
2	i have recommended gd to all my spec wearing pals and colleagues .
2	buying specs online is different to buying in a store but i do thoroughly_recommend it .
2	buying items from medicanimal . com is so easy as my elderly_cat is now on special_diet and was advised by my vet to go online as it is much_cheaper .
2	the only teeny wee_bit downside is yodel do not make delivery on saturdays
2	easy to order and the delivery was quicker_than_expected .
2	will definitely use you again :)
2	i purchased 0 oki printers from printerland due to the price and the fact that i could open an account with them .

2	they took my money immediately of course .
2	email arrived saying 0 - 0_days for delivery .
2	no call by 00rd_dec to come and collect .
2	this was a christmas_present .
2	rang and was advised waiting for stock and as soon as they came in they would be sent out .
2	this prompted them to then send an_email about delayed delivery .
2	by 0th_january still no ipad .
2	i rang and was advised there still was no stock and did i want to cancel .
2	i replied no i wanted my ipad .
2	an_email was sent to advise of my concern .
2	anyway to cut along story_short , today ( 00th janaury ) they have finally admitted they have no stock and are cancelling the order and refunding my money .
2	( they still tried to get me to cancel the order though because then they would not have been in breach of contract ) well that is simply not good enough .
2	they have had use of my money for nearly 0_months .
2	could you imagine if it had been the other way around ?!
2	i have also spent hours emailing or ringing them , to say nothing of not having the use of the item !
2	they are a complete disgrace and customer_services is a waste of space .

2	i am a big_fan of healthspan , and have been a regular customer for many_years .
2	i like the products because you get clear information with medical input about why you might find them of benefit , both on the website and through the magazine .
2	i find them good value for the high_standard of product that they are .
2	i was recommended to try glucosamine , msm and chondroitin by a neighbour who initially couldn_'_t walk up the steep drive to my house due to painful knee_joints .
2	i was a bit_sceptical_about his enthusiasm for this supplementation , but three_months later he could manage the climb without effort .
2	i had a spell where i stopped taking these tablets , and found joint stiffness and pain had returned , so i now make_sure i take them regularly and enjoy the mobility and easing of pain that they bring .
2	my family won_'_t take any vitamin_c product other than the 000mg chewable tablet as they love the flavour !
2	we also take the st clements fish_oil daily , capsules for travelling , liquid for home use .
2	the website is very easy to use , and i particularly_like to be able to access my previous_orders which makes placing a repeat order very easy .
2	the customer reviews are a bonus .
2	i find the quality is excellent , as is customer service if you need any help with ordering .
2	delivery is very quick and troublefree - the new flat containers and recyclable_packaging fit through the letterbox - how innovative is that !

2	i have also used yodel to send parcels too
2	brilliant service all_round

2	could not ask for a better company to deal with
2	very good and quick delivery
2	i ordered approx_£_00 goods a week_ago , i noted they do not dispatch items at weekends so assumed this would be sent on monday .
2	therefore based on 0 - 0_days delivery i should have my items , but i don_'_t .
2	i have used chemist_direct , boots , pet at home , pets supermarket , amazon , play . com , the hut , tesco direct , wilkinsons , thortons , hotel_chocolat , debenhams , marks & spencers , wallis , sports direct , & others & received better service .
2	superdrug get your act_together before you become the next company to bite the dust !
2	customers vote with their feet & will shop elsewhere .
2	prompt delivery , parcel not damaged was completely secure .
2	this company phoned me and said they were from google and that they were phoning me as my " free year '_s google period " is expiring .
2	i specifically_asked if they were from google and the woman said yes and that they would extend my free period by two_weeks , i didn_'_t even know i had a free period ...
2	i find out later this is all lies .
2	after the sales rap i told them that i would not be entering into any agreement until the end of the two_weeks so i can see if the google site had any benefits .
2	they have not ( funnily_enough ) got a recording of this part of the conversation and nor do they have a recording of the initial call where they say they are from google , they deny they even said it , looking at previous_reviews there is a pattern here as they have said the same thing to other people .
2	they put the phone down on me when i tried to explain about this and their bullying tactics and the reviews that correspond with my report , how unprofessional .
2	apparently they know all about the bad_reviews but keep on misleading people .
2	anyway i have reported them to trading_standards for this and also fraud and misrepresentation .
2	we always use sun_transfers now and even have recommended them to a friend who found them really good too .
2	they are always on time , the cars are really clean ( we use private_taxi ) and they are friendly too .
2	prices are very competitive with other transfer companies .
2	if i need to amend a booking it is really easy and response time for any_queries is good too .
2	keep_up the good work !
2	several quotes all competing for the job choose the one that you find best for you and its done .
2	great easy to use fast service .
2	one click and its on its way .
2	as promised delivery on time and a call to keep me infirmed
2	great .
2	service great value and fast delivery .
2	it was just so easy i will not_hesitate to use them again
2	no_problems , good communication , fast shipping
2	after_reading the reviews i was a bit_concerned_about placing an order , however due to cost of away liverpool kit for my 0 year_old i went_ahead with my order .
2	placed an order for full kit with name and number on tuesday_lunchtime .
2	received email_confirmation with tracking_number even thought i received free_postage .
2	was expecting parcel to arrive approx monday_morning , however it arrived safe and sound this morning .
2	great item , speedy postage , great value , will be using again .

2	thank_you so much will definitely use your firm again
2	lenstore has a really easy website to use so the process was quick and straightforward , and the lenses arrived the very next working day after ordering .
2	also , the packaging fit through the letterbox so no_hassles if you ' re out at work - your lenses are waiting for you when you get back .
2	excellent .
2	possibly the best customer service i have ever_experienced , and also the specs are exactly right - they did a perfect job of getting a complicated prescription and lens specification right - many huge high_street_opticians seem way - y - y - y behind these people .
2	it '_s so great to get a good product and good back - up .
2	i '_d order a 0nd_pair just to experience it .
2	i will recommend you to everyone i know who_wears specs .

2	i bought these for my 00 year_old mother for xmas .
2	they seemed a better quality than others i saw online at a comparable or lesser price .
2	i liked that they strapped over the foot as i felt this would be better for my mother , who can be reluctant to try anything that is different or takes effort .
2	( i had to show her how to use them )
2	they arrived promptly just before xmas and my mother has now tried them and is pleased and feels much_safer walking in them .
2	i ordered a mid sleeper bed with chair mattresses and free pillow .

2	my name is not caroline henry and i am confused how you can send to the correct email address but use an incorrect name .
2	i have used glasses_direct several_times_now and will_continue to use them . they have a wide_choice of frames and there is never any delay . a very professional company .
2	i needed to change an item i had purchased and this was done speedily , efficiently and politely . a very well run company . no_hesitation in using again .
2	i immediately realised once i '_d placed an order late last night that i had put my own address instead of the intended_recipient '_s address .
2	i emailed straight_away and rang first thing this morning only to be told that it was not possible to amend the delivery address as the order had been processed even_though the delivery is not going to be delivered until tomorrow .
2	no room for error and no customer service - completely unsympathetic to what was a genuine mistake that could easily have been rectified given the fact that i had realised and informed eflorist immediately .
2	thanks a bunch .
2	i will not be using you again .
2	great smooth service will be using it again
2	easy to order and track delivery .
2	very efficient cleaner and much_faster_than previous brands of cleaner .
2	very easy to use website , very good prices , easy to understand as inclusive of vat and postage free if orders over_£_00 .
2	excellent service usually next_day or two day delivery .
2	prescription service and repeats also excellent .
2	viovet keeps customers informed by email .
2	would recommend them to anybody .
2	i have bought from viovet before and will again ......... excellent service , very fast and reliable .
2	thank_you
2	ordered jacket on sunday and because i did not want to pay for postage the delivery time was 0_days .
2	the jacket was actually delivered on the thursday .
2	it was exactly as ordered and i would recommend this site and will use it again .
2	fast efficient service but unfortunately wrong shirt sent it didn_'_t even match the shirt on the delivery note .
2	await delivery of the correct one .
2	got through quickly to the help line and my problem was resolved in a few_minutes .
2	very pleasant and efficient operator - katie , brilliant .
2	couldn_'_t have been more straight - forward or simple .
2	perfect .
2	a total pleasure .
2	first time ihad used this company what a wonderful experience hassle_free and so easy
2	what a crazy carry on over a mere booking that didn_'_t work out on 00march0000 .
2	i booked a ryanair ticket stansted to karlsruhe online through bravofly , only to receive a jumbled email the next_day saying payment had not gone_through , querying something to do with my credit_card .
2	alarmed , i phoned my bank , to find all absolutely fine with my card .
2	phoned bravofly : first operator could not speak_english - i asked him to repeat , and then even to spell what he was saying , but even that made no sense .
2	i phoned back : different operator , very thick accent , he simply kept_repeating my money would be returned in 00 days to my card .
2	when i told him no money had been taken from my card , nor did i want any to be as i was cancelling , he spoke over me in a loud monotone voice , endlessly repeating " your money is freezin .
2	money will return to you in 00 days .
2	bank rules , not us .
2	your money is freezin ...." on and on .
2	i asked to be put through to a supervisor and he just kept_repeating on and on over me .
2	final phone_call to bravofy and got charming woman with good english who told me payment had never gone_through because ryanair had upped their prices and bravofly could not get ticket .
2	i told her previous 0 operators had been disasters , and she explained they are not able to refer a caller on .
2	presumably that is why they insult the caller by endlessly repeating the same - incorrect message at them .
2	my conclusion ?
2	don_'_t go near such a poorly serviced travel company whose phone operators are clearly struggling , even to find out what has happened , never mind communicate it to the customer .
2	i never book a hotel without first checking it out on ta .
2	have just recently also used it to check out restaurants in playa_blanca , lanzarote before a holiday and it was defintely worth doing - with so much choice there , it was great to be able to go to the best .
2	i '_ve_used bitdefender total internet security for about 00 years .
2	in that time it '_s caught a handful of viruses but my pc has never been infected .
2	it works well and doesn_'_t slow up my system .
2	i '_ve bought 0 pcs from pc_specialist ( over 0 years ) and both_times have been delighted .
2	it '_s easy to choose a standard spec and to then customise it from drop - down_menus .
2	the ordering system automatically checks for component compatibility and if your power_supply is great enough .
2	you can post the spec to user forums to get feedback or ask pc_specialist directly .
2	in_spite of being an on - line service , their customer service feels very personal : i contacted them with a question about my old pc when it was 0 years and they answered it v quickly .
2	delivery felt easy : dhl give you a 0 hour_slot so no waiting in all day .
2	the pc comes very well_packaged and with all the manuals and driver discs ; including , crucially , the windows 0 disc - lots of places don_'_t give you the disc !
2	can '_t recommend highly_enough .
2	purchased my swimming_costumes in the sale ; so an already excellent price got better !
2	delivered very promptly .
2	one costume was too_big , sent it back for a refund , which was credited straight_away without_fuss .
2	will shop_here again and happy to reccommend to all .
2	received my picnic basket and i am very pleased .
2	quality item at an excellent price and very well_packaged .
2	charlies were unable to supply one part of my order , but informed me promptly , giving me an option of a substitution .
2	i will happily shop with charlies again and reccommend them to friends and family .
2	i ordered some yarn by phone after 0 in the afternoon the person i spoke to took time to find what i was looking for and it all arrived the next_day .
2	you cannot do better_than that .
2	gifts were delivered in time .
2	well received by the birthday person .
2	would use these_guys again .
2	really good service .
2	have used their services often and will_continue to do so .
2	five_stars for the staff in carphone_warehouse victoria street london .
2	great advice , very helpful and patient .
2	call_centre aren_'_t in touch with the products being offered and i had to instruct them where to look on their own website .
2	despite my efforts i nearly ended_up with two phones neither of which where on the correct tariff .
2	tip_: go to carphone_warehouse and talk to a human_being .
2	i ordered a bouquet , chocolates and a balloon for my mum .
2	only the bouquet arrived and it was frankly rubbish .
2	i have complained twice and am still_awaiting a response from customer service .
2	having been a good customer for christmas and birthday cards i am very disappointed by this shoddy service .
2	i wouldnt recommend this company .
2	first_utility never transferred my accounts from the old supplier , yet still charged me for a whole new bill with them .
2	i then got bills from my old electricity and gas suppliers .
2	obviously i complained and cancelled my direct_debit with first_utility .
2	first_utility didn ; t cancel my direct_debit though , so it went out for four months .
2	i then tried to get a refund , they claimed they had transferred the account from the old electricity_supplier , i contacted the old electricity_supplier , and they said never_heard of the transfer .
2	this is now a year later , they are still not refunding me the whole amount .
2	as for compensation ?
2	frustrated .
2	the cheapness of their offers , has cost a lot .
2	update , finally i got my full_refund + some compensation .
2	brilliant , you might think but wait , no , a bill arrives today for an overdue energy account of £_000 . 00 , energy accounts that never existed , even a year and a half ago , when i did try to join first_utility , with all the associated trauma that went with it , unbelievable
2	i was very satisfied with the service .
2	have used petmeds for number of years_now and have always found them to be competitively_priced with consistent good service and delivery is free throughout uk .
2	!
2	latest order placed one morning and received early the next - brilliant !!!
2	!
2	viovet provided us with much_cheaper medication for our cat than our vet was able to .
2	the medication arrived swiftly and was exactly as ordered .
2	they even send us a reminder when we might be requiring more .
2	thank_you viovet , from both us and fluffer muffer !
2	a friend told me about quidco didn_'_t really believe you could get money for shopping but never looked back since it '_s so easy and really is something for nothing
2	purchased under_counter lights which were excellent value and good quality and delivery was very fast .
2	i have ordered several_times from thecharmworks website and their products are simply amazing value and beautifully_crafted .
2	their customer service is outstanding - indeed i would rate them as first_rate service providers like you used to get in the 0000s !
2	a dream to do_business with and a website i cannot recommend enough .
2	i have used viovet for many_years_now and have always found them to be good value for money .
2	their delivery service is fast and the packages always arrive in good condition .
2	if there is ever a problem in getting a product i have ordered , the customer service ladies always email me to keep me advised of any delays .
2	. i find the website so easy to use and find the items i am looking for .
2	very easy check out , swift delivery and well_packaged .
2	always an excellent service .
2	thank_you petmeds .
2	wider_selection of lights i was looking for and at a great price .
2	the website was very easy to use .
2	good customer service as i needed updates on delivery due to the lights being imported which was made clear before i ordered .
2	fast delivery when in stock .
2	i would buy from this company again .
2	i have often purchased from chemist_direct and the quality of service has always been excellent with fast delivery and items well_packaged .
2	excellent service , great communication , fast delivery , well_packaged and good price .
2	i will be ordering from viovet again .
2	very pleased .
2	very pleasant staff who were quick and efficient to sort_out and replace an item damaged in transit , a real_pleasure with great customer_care .
2	many_thanks .
2	they are always so helpful and the speed of delivery is amazing .
2	my husband and i booked what was supposed to be a two week holiday in portugal , however due to thomas_cook '_s lack of attention to detail and disgraceful lack of staff knowledge , we ended_up in one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed in , in spain !
2	we '_ve fought with them for compensation since may and have finally had to admit defeat , accepting a miserly payment of £_000 for a holiday that cost us in excess of £ 0000 .
2	this despite the fact that they fully reimbursed two ladies who went to watchdog on bbc with exactly the same issue .
2	obviously i should have done this but i mistakenly believed that , after admitting that it was their mistake , they would treat us fairly .
2	i have never been so wrong in my life .
2	one thing though is certain - i will never book with them again .
2	ordered watch at 00 . 00_pm one day , arrived 00 am next_day .
2	great service .
2	richard_mileham from parcel 0 go - very fast and efficient with friendly communication .
2	excellent service .
2	was kept up to date with status of my order .
2	really pleased with the product and it arrived less_than 00_hours after ordering on line .
2	was sent a txt to let_me know what time delivery would be and even given the option of changing this time if_necessary .
2	would definitely order from homesupply . co . uk in the future and will be recommending to family and friends .
2	always use this company , fast efficient service and a totally brilliant range of stock !
2	simple order process , kept_informed of status of order , arrived to schedule , very pleased and have no_reservations recommending this company on the service i received .
2	the product is also excellent , easy to set_up , overall brilliant experience , thank_you
2	i '_m so pleased i found this great online company , their prices are fantastic and as long as they carry on their business this way with such great offers , i shall_continue to use them , they enable me to buy more items that i certainly couldn_'_t afford to buy in the shops or at other online sites , plus it '_s not just well stocked and well priced perfumes you can buy , they seem to deal in all beauty products and what ever you want you can guarantee fantastic low_prices and i '_d recommend them all the way !
2	the item i ordered yesterday_afternoon arrived by parcel_force this morning .
2	i couldn_'_t fault the service - far better_than trying to order the item which was out of stock in the local outdoors shop - the staff there were sullen and disinterested - a much_better experience to order online and receive excellent service !
2	i was diagnosed as a type 0 diabetic in 0000 and given the usual talk of sticking to a healthy diet including a small_amount of carbohydrate with every meal .
2	i stuck to this but had problems with nodding off at work and not knowing if i needed to eat something or run around the block .
2	my weight continued to fluctuate between 00 - 00 . 0 stones .
2	as per_usual for the nhs my gp adhered to research that is 00 + years out of date & would not let_me have the blood testing sticks on prescription until i require insulin to control my diabetes .
2	i could_afford to buy my own monitor but at £_00 a pot for 00 test sticks could not afford to test myself .
2	my brother - in - law is a recently_diagnosed type 0 diabetic and since his son was diagnosed as a type 0 aged_00 , twelve years_ago they have both done a lot of research about the condition and its horrendous affects on one '_s body and are insistent that it is not going to happen to them !
2	!
2	they are determined to bring their sugar levels down to between 0 - 0 . 0 base level , to do this my brother - in - law tests 0st thing in the morning and 0 hours after breakfast , then before every meal and 0 hours after .
2	he sticks rigidly to a low carbohydrate diet and has cut his calorie intake , it has taken him 0_months but he is almost there with the added_benefit of loosing several stones in weight .
2	i have been on a low carbohydrate diet and testing 0 / 0 times a day since 00th_february when i weighted in at 00 stones 0 pounds .
2	i was staying with my sister for a week and ate what they ate and lost 0 pounds .
2	since coming home i have cut out most carbohydrate from my diet , i do not count calories , enjoy what i eat and have not suffered from any food cravings .
2	i feel really alert and only get ' tired ' when i have too many carbohydrates , my total weight_loss to date is 0 . 0 stones over 00 weeks .
2	this has_been made possible due to being introduced to home health ( uk ) ltd by my brother - in - law as a cheap source of blood_sugar monitoring equipment .
2	i have found the service to be fast , reliable and the prices are to die for , the codefree starter_pack and 000 test sticks came to just under_£_00 . 00 .
2	with a pot of 00 testing sticks for £ 0 it is certainly affordable to ensure your continued good health .
2	well_done home health ( uk ) ltd .
2	however , it does raise the question if home health ( uk ) ltd can sell the required products and make a profit why does it cost the nhs £_00 . 00 a pot for 00 testing sticks !!!
2	also if the nhs was honest and truthful with the information they give to all pre_- diabetic and diagnosed diabetics and used the results of the most up to date research for their treatment the overall monetary and human cost to the nation would drop dramatically !!!!!

2	after having booked a holiday to florida with my daughter and 0 grandchildren to celebrate our 00th_wedding_anniversary , my husband was diagnosed with cancer i emailed the hotel to see if i could get an electric_scooter delivered direct to the hotel to help him get around , the hotel was great no problem they would see to it and looked forward to seeing us in august , imagine my surprise when i got a email from the hotel to say sorry we had cancelled our booking ( we hadn_'_t ) contacted alpha_rooms who apologized and said they had changed supplier but all was now ok .
2	emailed the hotel back and was told there is no booking for you , contacted alpha_rooms again kept on hold for over 00_minutes there is not a problem the booking is confirmed , emailed the hotel still no booking showing for us , i have rang alpha_rooms again on hold for over 00_minutes at premium_rate , i asked for a call back to confirm everything was in order sorry i have 0 customers in a queue cant call you back well sorry is not good enough i am stressed enough without all this , customer service is appalling , unable to understand the indian service advisor very broken accent , stuck as have paid money and leave in 0_weeks we just wanted a break with our family before my husbands surgery , sort your act out , you should be ashamed of your total_lack of service , i have contacted hotel to see if we have a booking or not i am_disgusted with you
2	excellent service , bought premium parrot_food for my african_grey on their advice and although he has only been taking it for a few_days he has stopped plucking his feathers . i am delighted and will be looking to feed my cats and dog with their advice , great company , helpful and very professional , i can '_t praise them enough .

2	they were truly irresistable !
2	safercigs are great .
2	good products , service and support .
2	thanks darren
2	as a regular buyer online it '_s always a bonus to find a site that does free_returns .
2	it gives_peace of mind_knowing you don_'_t have to fork_out on a return / exchange etc .
2	reasonable pricing too so it '_s not as though they '_ve upped their prices to cover for the free_returns .
2	website and delivery were perfect , thanks !
2	speedy service , excellent prices .
2	thank_you .
2	minimal_packaging .
2	excellent advice and some great deals
2	never had a problem , and can buy small_quantities are reasonable_prices .
2	got a free delivery voucher for a year from groupon and find it a very handy way to shop for groceries .
2	not sure if i '_ll continue though after the voucher ends , as it may be too expensive .
2	i have just bought an ipod_nano from student_computers .
2	i first used this company when my son went to university and we bought him a mac .
2	he was thrilled and totally_unaware that it was reconditioned .
2	i feel the same about my ipod .
2	my only_moan was that there were no english instructions and i am not exactly au_fait with technology .
2	fortunately i have 0 ipod using children who were all on hand to instruct me .
2	the sound quality is excellent and it really is in a + condition as stated on the website .
2	i would recommend student_computers to anyone who_wants technology at an affordable price .
2	i cannot get these items in shops , it was great to be able to get them online .
2	going to have these items sent every couple of months .
2	would reccomend to anyone .

2	fast efficient service would recommend
2	i ordered a yamaha keyboard for my daughters_birthday .
2	i gave plenty of time i was getting worried as the order hadn_'_t arrived , i emailed them they told me they would have the item on the 0st of may .
2	then i emailed again as my daughters_birthday was the 00th_may .
2	then then told me a 0 - 0 week wait i had no choice but to upgrade and pay the extra .
2	the delivery was then very fast , and the keyboard is excellent .
2	great game for my son and the best price around .
2	arrived very quickly would use them again .
2	i had looked at this garden clock for my father in law in some garden centers .

2	the posting was fast and i would buy from them again .
2	this is the second time i have used serenata_flowers and it won ´_t be the last .
2	i was kept_informed every_step of the way from ordering to delivery , which was free , brilliant .
2	i live_abroad and have to rely_on other people when i want gifts sent and serenata has_been a great find for me .
2	my parents - in - law were very happy with the flowers sent on the occasion of their diamond_wedding yesterday and the display took pride of place next to the telegram from the queen .
2	thank_you very much serenata .
2	the safest_way to pay for products and services without having to share your card or bank details over the internet .
2	i have bought lots of items on ebay with no_problems_whatsoever , however , i did have one bad_experience which customer support helped_me to resolve very quickly and efficiently .
2	i have been using supplements from nature ´_s best for a couple of years_now and have found them to be very good value for money and does what it says .
2	i have recommended several people to nature ´_s best , they have tried other_suppliers but have come_back to the best on the market .
2	i couldn ´_t_believe_how fast the money reached my account .
2	i posted the phone on monday and the money was paid in tuesday .
2	i will definitely use them again and recommend them to all my friends and family .
2	very pleased with the online service to answer my queries and give me a quote speedy delivery of the product with all the installation information , easy to fit
2	i phoned the showerdoc to ask for some advice re my broken shower , and within 00_hrs , the part i needed was delivered to me and i repaired the shower easily .
2	i am so pleased with the great service from this company , i will definitely use showerdoc again .
2	thank_you so much .
2	no stars greenpod , i have used this compay before without_any problem for laser_printer_ink .
2	i liked their green credentials , so last month i ordered a rainbow set of inks , paid by paypal ( thank_goodness i did ) no ink ever arrived and even after_contacting the company via_email they did not respond in any positive manner .
2	their phone no voicemail was always full so i could never leave a message .
2	i needed the ink for my business so had to order from another_supplier .
2	fortunately , after raising the issue with paypal the payment has_been refunded .
2	sorry greenpod , such awful service for you will mean i never order from you again .
2	my old fridge died on 00st_dec and i thought i would be fridgeless for the festive_season - a friend told me about ao . com - i ordered a new one at 0pm that day and it arrived at 0 . 00 next_day with friendly helpful delivery men - well_done - i will definitely use them again - first_class service and competitive_prices - they even took away the old fridge !!
2	!
2	recently pills have been taken off the shelves in chemists that i use .
2	dreadful migraine and these do the job perfectly .
2	i got home ordered them on line without prior use of mypharmacist as i just googled it , went to my daughter '_s the following_day , in the evening the pills were on the mat .
2	if you suffer from migraine you will appreciate what a relief this is for me .
2	i had a very courteous email from mypharmacist and will use again and refer too .
2	thank_you so very much .
2	the cotswold_company communicated well throughout the process once i had ordered my wardrobe .
2	i paid £_00 to have item delivered within a 0 hour period and it was delivered on time .
2	i got a phone_call to say when it would arrive .
2	very good customer service and i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to order something again .
2	( i think they e_- mailed too ) perhaps they should ask to share the experience nearer to when the purchase was made - its been nearly a month and i cant_remember the details now .
2	we are waiting for 0 reading_festival ticket which is for thursday but its tuesday and no sign of delivery .
2	there is only an_automated_voice at the end of the phone line and no reply to e_- mail , my daughter is heartbroken that her ticket doesnt look like it will arrive .
2	why cant there be a person at the end of the line who can help us ?
2	what can i do ?
2	as an update viagogo phoned tonight to offer a refund as the tickets will not be delivered .
2	we are grateful for that but now have to try to find a ticket elsewhere .
2	when i did a bad_review on trustpilot it did get a reaction from mighty_deals but only for them to lie to me or totally ignore me .
2	it would be nice if i could get a positive response .
2	i ordered a goodmans digital recorder that when it finally came i found that the remote did not work ( i tried a friends remote and found that it worked with that one ) and when i contacted the company they said that it was up to mighty_deals to sort and mighty_deals are just ignoring me .
2	this has now been going on since october_0000 .
2	secondly i have paid for voucher for a set of 0 swan saucepans with a 00 piece cutlery_set but when i try to place my order they are trying to charge me another £_00 for the cutlery .
2	supplier has ignored me and mighty_deals seem to be taking ages to sort this for me .
2	i have been in touch with mighty_deals over the last month ( since 00th_march ) but so far although they have promised to send me a remote_control nothing has arrived and as far as the 00 piece cutlery_set goes i have heard absolutely nothing .
2	mighty seals are a total_rip_off
2	we were very impressed with the range of products and service from viovet .
2	we fully_intend to purchase other products for our shih_tzu jess .
2	easy to order , arrived in super - quick time and ( thanks to the online demo ) it was easy to fit with no diy experience whatsoever !
2	for complete novices - because of the huge choice of shower_seals - it might be helpful to include in the video confirmation that it doesn_'_t matter ( or that it does ) which shower_seal you use .
2	i changed the type from the one we had previously but i think the new one looks better altogether and it does the job .
2	definitely would use this firm again .
2	thank_you for an altogether excellent service .
2	put my order in to littlewoods for a dyson_hoover late on tuesday and it arrived via a very pleasant man this morning .
2	my head is spinning at the speed of these people .
