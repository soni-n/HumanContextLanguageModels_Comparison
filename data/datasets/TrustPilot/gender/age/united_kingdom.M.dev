0	this is probably the worst experience i have ever had when trying to book a holiday .
0	first of all their website doesn_'_t work properly .
0	when trying to book online , i went to submit the payment and it was just loading and loading but not going through .
0	i tried on several different computers and got the same issue .
0	i tried to ring customer service but the line was dead .
0	i emailed them but they never got back to me .
0	then just as i was about to pay for a holiday with another airline , a confirmation_email came through followed_by several emails saying my item is still in the basket !!
0	!
0	i have since flown and come_back only to see that i '_ve been charged an additional £_00 .
0	but rather_than try to help me , they have given me a list of possible reasons_why this may be ( purchase extras and exchange_rate differences ) and asked me to refer to terms and conditions .
0	so now i have to explain to them that any extras i purchased were debited outside of this and the exchange_rate has barely moved .
0	sometimes i think it would just be easier to bang my head against the wall !
0	the mere fact that google is set as my home page says it all .
0	facebook is everywhere nowadays .
0	a very powerful tool and one that i will_continue to happily use indefinately .
0	perfect price , service , usability , perfect in every way .
0	can '_t think of any way to criticise amazon simply because their service and products have made my life_easier in every way possible .
0	thanks to oneclickpharmacy , i can get essential items cheaper_than anywhere_else .
0	thank_you

0	no_hassle .
0	excellent quality , excellent price , excellent service , fast delivery .
0	couldn_'_t recommend more .
0	got a good deal at affordable_supplements .
0	one of the items included a 0kg box of cnp_pro recover .
0	however when the package arrived , the cnp box has_been cracked underneath and the handle at the top had been snapped_off .
0	the crack has resulted_in about 000 - 000g spillage .
0	i was dissapointed about this and had to spend time transferring the contents to another box i had which had almost run out .
0	still a good deal but the inconvenience and loss of weight resulted_in me giving 0_stars .
0	i had a 0st time perfect buying experience with this company .
0	firstly they were by far the cheapest seller of what i needed they beat ebay and the other online sellers so i placed my order .. almost strait_away they emailed me apologising that they had just sold the last stock and couldnt finish my order so i called them .
0	the extremely_helpful know their stuff team offered me a full_refund with a next shop voucher or an_alternative product completely in my favour worth alot more which is what i took .. i would strongly_recommend this irish company and will_definitely only use them from now on and will be back soon ...
0	thanks guys colin
0	fast delivery , brilliant service and well priced products .
0	to be recommended .
0	i live in portugal and had a problem with my keyboard , i flew it back to them and they got me a new one dispatched straight to my uk address on christmas_eve ( amazing ) and ready in time for gigs over the new year !

0	paid in full for valentines flowers and on the day they decide to change the delivery date !!!!!
0	they are ignoring calls and emails ( 0 days now ) but have put a very small apology on the website .... ha !
0	its too late valentines has_been and gone so the flowers are useless and the day has_been ruined !
0	if you cant handle the orders dont take peoples money !
0	p . s .
0	hurry up and give me my money back !
0	if i lived_closer id be down there collecting it in person !
0	stay_away !
0	used parentpay a few_times , slow processing was one thing but having a letter arrive home in your 0 year_old '_s bag that had your log - in details on is another .
0	comforting to know that the school office and any of the kids they use as runners can now access my account .
0	my advice - not with a barge_pole !
0	ordered a climbing_frame , was supposed to be delivered 00 / 00 , saw it was out for delivery between 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 , teaching strikes were on so kids at home and all excited_about helping to build it .
0	waited_until 00 : 00 no delivery so i phoned the nottingham branch that it was due to come from , to be told , as it was 000kg they could not fit it on the vehicle and they are struggling for drivers , are they trying to fit it on a van ??
0	...
0	unacceptable , today is my kids birthday and i have tried to phone the depot again to see if it '_s on their vehicle , but at 00 : 00 i get the response " our opening_hours are from 00 : 00 "
0	consignment_number zfbrfu000000
0	my story , i ordered a new ( ex_display ) sony_tv for over £_0k back at the beginning of may for delivery on the friday .
0	due to just moving_house there was a issue with the card , which i quickly sorted .
0	after completing the payment everything_went down_hill , i first received a emessage ( their msging system ) saying we are sorry , but due to unforeseen_circumstances your goods have not been despatched for delivery .
0	please continue to monitor your emails for tracking_details .
0	on the friday i asked when it was being delivered and was given a company to ring and consignment_number , the company that i was given was closed for the weekend at this time , so i had to wait_until monday to ring , which i did , the company had no record or knowledge of this consignment , i had also checked on the friday and was told it was being picked_up that day , so why was there no record ??
0	due to it being so late , i cancelled the order , knowing full well it hadn_'_t even been dispatched , this took another week to get a reply , i was told it was with the technical engineers and that they would phone me the next_day , my reply to this was of wonder ," why is it there ?
0	i have cancelled it before its been dispatched !"
0	funnily_enough no reply until today , where they have now sent me and email with the refund details on it , stating 0 - 0 days to receive these into my account , and taking off nearly_£_000 less_than the original purchase price , i have already replied with the fact that this is illegal and have now left in the hands of my credit_card company to get the full_amount back .
0	i have kept all documentation and copied all the emessages that have been sent to me , for legal use at a later date if need be .
0	my advice is if your making a large purchase , don_'_t do it from here .
0	i wouldn_'_t trust anything these_guys say , i also doubt some of the other comments on here that are just being used to boost the scores up .
0	sales order 00000000
0	returns associated with invoice #_00000000 rma_number :_00000000 accepted
0	it '_s hectic trying to keep_up with my brothers and sisters .
0	my biggest brother lives in spain , my sis lives in mexico , and my other brother lives in franch .
0	dialtosave made it less hectic to keep track of all the international calls and so forth .
0	i mean they really saved me a lot of money and i '_m glad for it !
0	thanks :)
0	everything about the company is faultless .
0	the pricing and quality of the products is ideal .
0	quite possibly the best_tasting_protein i '_ve ever had .
0	this was also confirmed by the 0 people i referred .
0	the reward_scheme is also great .
0	being_able to earn substantial money per new customer .
0	the delivery service couldn_'_t be_faulted either .
0	i ordered quite late and still received delivery next_day .
0	the social_media side of the company is also a bonus .
0	fast response from their twitter account .
0	there is the only the odd product i will go_elsewhere for now .
0	years_ago i recomended myprotein to a lot of friends and people in the gym .
0	prices were more than reasonable , products were good quality and despatch / delivery was quick .
0	after a little break of dealing_with myprotein i decided to give them another shot .
0	all address details were given but once despatch email came through important details of the address were missed off .
0	as i expected no goods turned_up .
0	tried to speak to myyodel which i will never deal with again .
0	i was told that they were signed for by someone i ' d never_heard of .
0	then after a while they told me they wouldn_'_t help me any more and that i need to contact myprotein .
0	it took 0 messages to get a response from myprotein .
0	even after this response it was just to tell me the same information of problems that i had reported .
0	even a second response days_later sounds_like the customer service could not be_bothered to read the problem details correctly !
0	feels_like the company has got too big and forgotten the basics .
0	really not happy with the service i '_ve received .
0	the only part that '_s gone_smoothly so_far is taking the money from me !
0	will never deal with the company again .
0	unfortunately can '_t even see the matter being solved any time soon .
0	very good customer service :)
0	i am writing this review and at the same time i am talking to orange customer service .
0	i have never ever been let_down so badly .
0	on thursday i thought i will give orange a try .
0	gone to argos got myself a payg_sim done a £_00 . 00 top up and called orange to transfer my number .
0	0gb free data seemed like a good thing .
0	so i called and registered my new number and done everything they asked to do .
0	was promised that my number will be ported over on friday before midnight .
0	i was told to keep turning my phone on and off during the day and eventually the number will be transferred .
0	come today morning nothing happened .
0	still no porting .
0	so i called orange ( 00p_each call to customer service !
0	) and asked what is going on .
0	long_story_short the person i spoke to told me i was given a bulk pac_code ( no such a thing !!!
0	) and it will be done on tuesday .
0	i did complaint and said it is not good enough and why has this not been done .
0	the person i was speaking to started being rude and was talking over me , i asked her not to do it and asked to be put to a supervisor .
0	the reply was “ i can talk over you and customer is not always right ”!
0	i demanded to speak to her supervisor and she than told me that there is no supervisors working today !!! impossible !
0	she than cut me off .
0	what a s !!!!
0	service , i called back and after trying to explain everything again another customer service person has cut me off .
0	0rd call now and i am speaking to a supervisor .
0	actually he has just put me on hold and i have been holding for 00_minutes .
0	i told_him that i want to make an official_complaint about him and his service and that i am not happy , i want to stop the porting .
0	he has put me on hold and i know he is just waiting for me to disconnect the call .
0	well i am on my way to orange shop now and let ’_s get this sorted there .
0	never use orange never !
0	i will tell all my friend not to trust them even if the give you free calls for life .
0	what a disappointment .
0	even the supervisors don_’_t care .
0	!!!
0	! oh well they just cut me of !!!
0	!
0	i have sent them my blackberry phones , i had them refurbished recently and they look like new .
0	i wanted to try these_guys as the price was the highest .
0	i paid for special delivery to send these phones to them as wasnt too sure on them and wanted to make_sure them get them quickly .
0	they tried to stich me up by reducing the price for each phone to nearly 0rd of the value .
0	after trying to get them to offer the original price and sending loads of emails i in the end askled for the phones to be sent back .
0	0_weeks_later i finally got them back and the protective screen covers i had on them have been removed by this company .
0	dont use them if you can help it .
0	bye
0	i have been using loads of different companies to recycle my mobile_phones and let_me tell you ; fonebank are just the best .
0	the pay the best money , send money quick and if you do have any_queries they sort them out without_any funny delays .
0	always use these_guys . just fantastic
0	i '_m very satisfied i found your web_page . reasonable prices , all accessible parts , quick response from suppliers and experienced customer service . i recommended it to all my friends .
0	i recently_bought a large_amount of flax seeds from the company .
0	i received confirmation when i had bought the product .
0	communication with natural ground was more than excellent .
0	i received my flax seeds soon after and it was of a high_quality .
0	defiantly be using this company again .
0	thanks
0	had my pre_- order for far_cry 0 insane edition [ pc ] cancelled by another site , 0 days before release .
0	was sold out everywhere [ still is to this day ], however ,
0	coolshop . co . uk was the only place to get more stock in .
0	while people were cashing in by selling them on ebay , coolshop sold it for a very reasonable price .
0	was dispatched on the 0th_dec and delivered on the 0th_dec .
0	can '_t say better_than that .
0	will_definitely use them again .
0	* only minor_problem was the outer_cardboard cover of the game was slightly_damaged in transit , but this is only a minor grumble .
0	the price match is phenomenal and the free and discounted products with your purchases make it so there is no doubt in my mind that i '_m getting the best deal when i am cashing out my supplements .
0	everything always arrives faster_than estimated and the order is always spot on .
0	fantastic prices and they have absolutely everything .
0	customer service is also money , they have fixed every issue i '_ve had and always respond within hours of my emails .
0	oh and you gotta_love getting free t - shirts and shaker_bottles !
0	easy and simple to navigate through the web_site and easy to purchase with a speedy delivery , would definitely recommend
0	i '_ve been making purchases from green man gaming ( gmg ) for a few_years_now , pc games / dlc .
0	sure you can buy most of the titles they sell elsewhere ( steam / origin / uplay etc ), but they sometimes have good deals on that aren_'_t running on the other_sites , they '_ve nearly always got discount_vouchers , and you can even trade some of your games back in ( i think any that use gmg '_s " capsule " thingy )!
0	brilliant .
0	i '_ve been shopping at aria . co . uk for about 0 or 0 years_now , buying various parts for my computers , and those of my family and friends .
0	there is a number of reasons i always go back to them : fantastic prices , speedy delivery , very helpful staff .
0	the community on the forums is ( for the most part ) also a very friendly / helpful one .
0	twice i '_ve had to return items , and both_times the staff have resolved my problem very quickly ( same day ).
0	00th of january i ordered myself a new cpu_cooler , the corsair h000i .
0	i ordered at around 00am , and it was in my hands by noon the next_day ( free delivery too )!
0	can '_t say_fairer_than that .
0	keep_up the good work guys !
0	a friend showed me supplement_warehouse a few_months_ago and now it '_s the only place i buy my supplements .
0	the site is easy to use , the prices are better_than any other site i '_ve gone_through , and their customer service is the best i '_ve dealt_with .
0	i highly_recommend supplement_warehouse to all my friends !
0	i got a month web i should be able to stream and download , on the first day i couldnt even watch youtube or dowload , second day i rang up they said they will refresh my account didnt work , they did this the next_day also , now on the fourth day i got a text saying my fair use policy has_been excided after not even streaming or down loading .... worst network out there , absoulate bull s ***.
0	this isnt the first time its happend
0	really helpful advice given on products .
0	competitively_priced goods , free next_day delivery and excellent packaging .
0	i would highly_recommend them .
0	can '_t fault this ... amazing product and fast delivery ...
0	recommended to me by a current user and happy to say i '_m pleased she did ... will_definitely be recommending to others
0	so happy i found this site ...
0	i '_m buying from it a few_times a month now ... never had any_problems with products or service ... love it so much that i '_m getting all my mates hooked on it too ...
0	a really top_class digital agency that helped push our website right to the top of google for several important and competitive search terms .
0	i would highly_recommend these_guys .
0	i found taxday . co . uk on google and through a very simple and helpful process , they helped_me claim £ 0000 back .
0	i have now booked myself a little trip away for me and the missus and will enjoy that money .
0	we are virgin_media customers that are looking to move home in 0 months time .
0	when advising virgin_media of this they told us that they could only provide slow broadband and telephone line to the area and not television services .
0	the only thing that i could do was to pay the £_00 a month fee for poor broadband and get tv through a 0rd_party provider that cannot provide the full virgin_media tv service .
0	i was given 0 options , pay a £_000 early disconnection charge or pay £_00 a month for a poor service .
0	as mentioned , i was happy to stick to virgin_media for the duration , but they could not provide the same service .
0	they have it written up in their ridiculous contracts that you do not have a choice so beware what you are signing into .
0	i took the £_000 disconnection charge as quite_frankly , the service is not that good .
0	we had issues with our phone line that took several weeks to sort and we were also advised by a virgin_media member of staff to purchase a new telephone as it was our problem .
0	it turned_out there was a problem with the phone line that the experts at virgin_media did not pick_up .
0	with regards to the tv , the pause , rewind and fast forward facility is no way nearly as good as what sky_+ offers , it '_s slow and the screen often blurs .
0	we have used sky and virgin and from my experiences with both , i would highly_recommend sky over virgin_media any day of the week .
0	the only reason that we did not use sky this time around was that we are in an apartment that we were not allowed by the building owners to put a dish on it .
0	ordered some 0xu gear from this site .
0	good range to choose from and delivered as requested .
0	i ordered 0 taps from tap centre , one bathroom and one kitchen_tap on 0 - 0 day delivery .
0	they both came after 0 days .
0	i will_definitely use again and recommend to all .
0	despite_being in ni , the delivery to england was very quick which i wasn_'_t expecting .
0	the product was well_packaged and works_perfectly .
0	really easy , sent my ipad on thursday had the money in my bank wednesday_morning , seems much_quicker_than alternative companies and a much_better price , deffinetly recommend .
0	this website has an amazing selection of the top supplements , or if you just need a multivitamin .
0	it is extremely easy to use , and the best part about this website is that they will match the price of any other website with an additional 0 %_off the competitors price .
0	it is the very first website i check to look up a supplement i want to purchase .
0	and it will always be the main website i use for all my supplement purchasing .
0	ordered a pair of rayban rare prints wayfarer and has the title_says received the next_day !
0	will recommend to all my friends :)
0	orders are easy and straightforward , loved being_able to get the bits and bobs i go through and the e_- liquid for a really good price and lightening_speed .
0	no more shifty envelopes from china coming through the door .
0	my only issue is having to be around to sign for the package , but otherwise i can find no fault , will be using again , very soon .
0	really cant_complain with the service that we received from chillisauce .
0	the booking process was really simple and allowed individuals to make installments if they wished .
0	the trip to riga was really well_organised we had bobsleigh and shooting range activities both were great and again well_organised .
0	the whole_thing is geared for stag groups and caused no_problems at all .
0	the accommodation was actually quite good , much_better_than i expected .
0	we couldn_'_t complain with any of the staff and we had great customer service throughout .
0	in short great customer service , made everything smooth and easy and good value for money .
0	no_complaints .
0	.... oh and plenty of booze which every stag_do should have !
0	i sent off my old_nokia to mazuma with some reservations as there are some negative_reviews out there .
0	however i can not praise the speed and ease of service .
0	i sent my phone to them last monday and by wednesday the sale was complete with the funds in my account .
0	brilliant service highly_recommended
0	this is the 0rd time i have used mazuma .
0	the 0st time i received my cheque by return post .
0	on the other occasions , i have had the money_transfered and it was in my account by 0000 on the day they received the phones .
0	you could not wish for a smoother transaction .
0	mazuma is a company i wouldn_'_t hesitate to recommend to my friends and family - 0st_class !!
0	!
0	make it clear !!!
0	!
0	and plus gameseek people how long does it take to receive new stock ?!
0	order a few_days ago and kind of understand that its out of stock now !!!
0	well its just not good enough !!!
0	a game that i bought has to now be here in 00days for a birthday_present .
0	not trying to fob you off gameseek but if it doesn_'_t get here in time i am going to have a extremely upset relative !
0	i have contacted you twice_now urging that you really need to get stock of the item , sorry gameseek if it fails to deliver i will never recommend you because seeing a child upset isn_'_t good !
0	not trying to play a gilt trip here because they never really work but please could you try your best to get bakugan defenders of the core psp game in stock , if this is at all possible you will knock [_link_] my favourite online store right off its pedal - stool .
0	oops starting to sound like gilt trip again ....
0	but anyway the point is that whatever item you need to try and get it in stock within like a week of it being out of stock ......
0	excellent service , giving you the option to track the progress of the unlock .
0	i certainly didnt just want to put my personal details onto any old website so it took me a while to do , but after_seeing 00k facebook likes and plenty of good feed_back i decided to go for it .
0	very happy i had been quoted around 00 / 00 pounds to unlock my phone in the local town so was very happy to see just 00pound on iphoneunlock !
0	took 0 . 0 days to unlock and was worth the wait , i thought it would of tool longer !
0	thank_you !
0	dealing_with company has_been extremely frustrating .
0	staff are polite , but once the order is in , they make almost no effort to get the items to you in a way that suits you .
0	bizarrely long_waits for the courier ( who have no phone number , web_site or contact address ) to bother to call you to inform you when , in the next few_months , they might do their job to try to deliver the goods .
0	if you are away or on holiday , then expect a few more weeks wait .
0	if you try to cancel out of sheer frustration , they ( illegally ) try to keep deposit to cover delivery that has not even occurred .
0	avoid
0	i am on a business contract , our company has_been on vodafone for many_years , my iphone had some issues within 0year and 0 month of having the phone , and of course it is not covered by warranty .
0	however , vodafone offer no other way of warranty such as other_companies do , e . g .
0	john_lewis offer 0 year_warranty on ipads .
0	bearing in mind the contract is 00 months .
0	while trying to sort this out , or seeing if they can offer me some kind of replacement or cheaper repair rather_than the £_000 to fix it .
0	( the phone is barely even worth that new now ).
0	their service was dreadful on the phone .
0	when i was told someone would call me back in a specific timeframe , no one did , i kept having to chase them up .
0	this happened multiple time , and their manager defended them .
0	i said if you arrange a callback it is polite to make that arrangement or at_least get someone to say that they may need to arrange another time .
0	service is dreadful and now the account_manager is now a team and not just one person .
0	we had a good relationship with our previous manager and the team are useless and only open minimal hours .
0	company does everything which it says - great price and product :)
0	good pricing , great product !
0	thanks !
0	didn_'_t receive product , so emailed customer service .
0	no reply .
0	i called them up after 0 days and was told i would be called back later .
0	i wasn_'_t that day so read_reviews which said they don_'_t always get back to you , they did saying it was sent to billing_address .
0	amateur mistake seeing as paypal says delivery address and you inputed it also .
0	they need to do proper stock checks - idiots , staff unhelpful and lack knowledge !
0	wait ages for assistance !
0	partmaster website is rubbish , next_day delivery doesn_'_t mention no sat delivery , you pay through the roof for a lousy controller !
0	avoid this chain at all costs
0	very organised site ,
0	every product is very well displayed and categorised professional_manner ,
0	really helpful .
0	these things are not available on different online stores .
0	rates are normal .
0	delivery time is good or ok .
0	but how they deliver is perfect .
0	but i spent more than 000_pounds , they didn_'_t offer any discount or gift , :(
0	absolutely_useless .
0	items never delivered within timescales , when large items are finally received they are damaged .
0	takes 00 working_days to hear back from customer service when chasing items and then another 00 working_days to book in a collection of an item .
0	looking over the reviews on the internet it is surprising this company is still trading .
0	would recommend that everyone stays away from they are a complete disappointment .
0	please don_'_t be_fooled_by the positive_reviews listed below i can only_assume they are left by the owners of the company or there are a few lucky people .
0	took an_absolute age to deliver ( about 0 months ).
0	i ordered the gloss_white tv_unit , came in 0 boxes and weighs over 000kg .
0	all boxes perfectly intact on delivery however almost every piece is damaged and scuffed .
0	you cannot email or call the customer service department as there is no phone number !?!
0	i was never offered a refund or a replacement even with their guarantees .
0	you will be lucky to get through on their only number , however when they do answer they will be more than happy to take your money but if you have a problem you have to call the same number which they always promise a callback from this socalled customer service team .
0	after about 00 promises and emails to the sales_team no callbacks happen .
0	if you get scammed please call your card company for a refund .
0	i called my bank and they claimed a chargeback using visa .
0	we did have problems as ideally you need to return the item , however 0 boxes weighing over 000kg and no return address makes things very difficult .
0	took about 0 months however have now received a full_refund and will now take a trip down the scrapyard to dispose of scrap that was left at my house .
0	please stay_away from this dodgy company and use a company that has all positive feedbacks as you will be very sorry when you get caught out .
0	fast , great service and the best prices !.
0	i reccomend to everybody ..
0	first time i ' d used blackcircles .
0	have been going to the same tyre place for 00 years - was checking typical prices online and decided i ' d give blackcircles a try .
0	had the same tyre cheaper_than my normal place ; the centre i chose for the fitting was great - no waiting , courteous staff , job well_done .
0	nothing but a good experience - will_definitely be using blackcircles again .
0	i ordered a shower_tray and a new sink from wd and it was a bit of a disaster as , even_though it had loads of packaging the courier managed to break the tray .
0	i rang them and got straight through to a lovely geordie chap , who sent me out a new tray next - day .
0	mistakes_happen but it '_s how a company deals with them that is a mark of the company .
0	good stuff wd !
0	!
0	i ordered a kit for christmas prezzie and it came within a few_days .
0	it was the best price i found online and the products were great .
0	can '_t wait to get my girlfriend sushi making !
0	i lived in miwaukee wi for many_years .
0	i always used the local supplement_warehouse store to physically purchace my products .
0	the staff were always knowledgable on products and helpfull in finding the right products for me .
0	you cant_beat the prices .
0	i now live in arizona .
0	supplement companys out here are way over priced and not knowledgable in their products .
0	i will_continue to use supplement_warehouse as my supplement company .
0	i also just recently found them on facebook .
0	they seem to answer peoples questions on there and have a great customer_support .
0	i dont_think anybody does it better_than supplement_warehouse
0	brilliant , it has got to be the fastest delivery i have ever received online ( and i have order a lot !)
0	and great prices too !
0	of all the places i '_ve searched for good quality furniture at a reasonable price , pine_solutions is the best , after my brother and sister recommended the site to me i am now on to my third purchase .
0	enough said !
0	great .
0	experience , i use them always
0	fast dispatch , good communication in different formats plus great variety of products
0	got the phone on the day they said i would , whenever i had a conversation with them over the phone they were very professional and courteous .
0	offered very good deal and would definitely deal with them again .
0	i bought a kingston ssd and chose the free delivery , when i bought it there was 00 + in stock , 0 days_later , the status still says " goods allocated ", so it hasn_'_t been dispatched yet .
0	to make things worst , they took the money straight_away , with no emails about any updates about my order .
0	and the estimated delivery was 0_weeks , which is strange considering when i checked again there was 000 + in stock apparently .
0	i then phoned them up asking if i could just add the extra cash to upgrade it to the next_day delivery , they said no , so i asked for a refund .
0	after the refund was issued , i bought the same ssd again , but chose to pay the extra £ 0 . 00 for next_day shipping .
0	guess_what ?...................
0	0 days_later , it still says " goods allocated " as the status , and now it says 000 + in stock , and of course no email about any update with regards to my order .
0	what a joke !
0	terrible !
0	filled the online form , received the freepost_bag the next_day .
0	and received the money in my bank_account 00_hrs later after sending the phone .
0	very fast and reliable service .
0	best price i could_find for my item and delivery so quick it showed up the day before release !
0	which in a winner in my book !
0	high_quality supplements with really quick delivery , would order again when required .
0	this shop is excellent .
0	prices are fairer_than fair , and most_importantly , the staff are honest and know what they are talking_about ... meaning you don_'_t get fobbed_off with some piece of crap instrument that '_s clogging up warehouse space .
0	without a doubt my go - to music shop .
0	after upgrading with phones0u , the sales_person advised a recycling comparison site for old_phones .
0	the result to give most money for my galaxy_sii was money0yourphone . com and after some_research online , i opted for them .
0	checkout was extremely easy and in 0 minutes the order was complete .
0	i had ordered a bag to send the phone in but it took 0 or 0 days to arrive , before which i ' d requested another ( which also turned_up in about the same amount of time ).
0	whether this is down to m0yp or the royal_mail , i don_'_t know .
0	be sure to send your phone as special delivery as this covers you up to £_000 .
0	signed for mail i believe is only £_00 .
0	emails for when my phone arrived with them and was tested are good , meaning you are kept in the loop .
0	payment does admittedly take a number of days after this ( i had the money in my account in full , 0 days before the date they stated however ) so if you ' re in a rush for the money , you may have to look_elsewhere .
0	given the amount they gave for my phone , and ignoring the envelope and delayed payment issues , i would definitely recommend these_guys .
0	they paid the most for my phone by a good 00 or 00_% i ' d say .
0	very happy .
0	a friend recommended a deal on game collection for a 000 wireless_headset and they were by far the cheapest .
0	i got the headset in the post 0 days_later .
0	many bigger retail sites can take a lot longer_than that .
0	i would highly_recommend game collection and will check them for any future_purchases .
0	i '_ve been buying from aria as an individual for several_years_now and i have never had a problem , either with aria or their couriers ( citylink ).
0	the company i work for also has a trade account with aria and our account_manager is always friendly and helpful , even_though he supports liverpool fc and not everton fc lol .
0	i '_m a member of the aria_forums and they have many incentives for members i . e .
0	competitions , free deliveries ( certain_amount of posts ), help and advice from the staff via the forums .
0	i would and do recommend aria all of the time !
0	if your paitent and have your ticket ready to scan your fine !
0	thankyou guys :)
0	excelelnt service and loyalty_scheme
0	my order was despatched promptly , arrived the next_day and was well_packaged .
0	very good value for money .
0	i was very pleased with the efficient service received from personal_injury assist .
0	they took care of all the necessary_documents and made the process seem so easy .
0	i would and have already_recommended this company to family , friends and colleagues .
0	joined british_gas homecare and had a problem with my boiler in my flat .
0	had 0 appointments to my flat for a various bs engineers to fix a problem .
0	either the engineer didn_'_t turn_up for the numerous appointments or the engineer arrived at the wrong time , but didn_'_t have the part and had to arrange another visit !
0	or he broke something else on his visit .
0	my wife and i had to take days off work for this ' service '.
0	we took so many days off from work sitting in the flat , waiting for an engineer to not turn_up , that we weren_'_t able to go on a holiday .
0	very unhappy - eventually i came to the end of my tether and cancelled the homecare .
0	we never were able to get any refund on the service that we had experienced .
0	after the nasty experience we got a local engineer to come around and fix the problem the next_day - should have done this in the first place .
0	a very expensive and unpleasant_experience .
0	don_'_t believe the slick adverts and marketing .
0	british_gas have the worst customer service in a company i have very come_across .
0	i will never use british_gas for anything again .
0	very poor service from plumbworld - i waited in for a day , it didn_'_t arrive and no contact was made .
0	i tried to phone the delivery company ( yodel ) but their phone lines didn_'_t work .
0	yodel eventually phoned me to say they would deliver 0 days_later .
0	i waited at home again ( took time off work ) and again no delivery .
0	couldn_'_t phone them and they failed to contact me .
0	after this frustrating experience i tried with little success in emailing plumbworld several_times ( they have no phone number ).
0	they did little to help for a full week - all this time my builder was waiting for the bathroom pieces to install .
0	yodel were no help either and lied to me that they would get someone to phone me back on my twice failed delivery .
0	i was getting more and more frustrated ...
0	eventually plumbworld sent out a second delivery with my stuff via a different delivery partner , seems that the first set had got lost by yodel .
0	this did arrive !
0	although a part of my order was missing and i '_ve got to wait 00 days for delivery since the date i arranged for it to be delivered .
0	i am very disappointed in plumbworld and their delivery partner yodel - if it works , then great .
0	but if you have any_problems you are in a world of pain .
0	next time i will purchase items from a different supplier .
0	they did refund me my delivery charge , but that is the least they could do under the circumstances .
0	items arrived when expected .
0	fast and efficient .
0	good quality products and was as expected . c recommended
0	hopefully you read this review this review , and those below , prior to engaging with this company .
0	i sent my samsung_galaxy_s0 on monday april 0nd via first_class delivery after being quoted £_000 .
0	delivery was confirmed by royal_mail the following_day .
0	no email was received to confirm this from bowozi however as they advise they will .
0	in fact i received an emailing another 00_hours_later stating that my handset had been recieved followed_by another email only a few minutes later downgrading my original quote by over £_000 !
0	i accept my handset was not brand_new hence_why i received a " used " quote .
0	it is imperative that anyone who is considering using this company reads the small_print in detail , you will for example have further_reductions on your original quote by £_00 if your phone is network locked and in theory your " used " phone should be in a brand_new condition in order to recieve the quoted payment .
0	in addidition to this if you decline the offer and wish to have your handset returned this will cost you £_00 - incurring yet more cost .
0	of course this is if you are able to reach anybody in customer service .
0	i have spent in excess of £ 0 attempting to contact this firm on numerous_occasions .
0	( the 0000 number provided is charged at a premium_rate regardless of wether or not some body answers .
0	often the line will ring for 00 seconds before being disconnected ).
0	in addition emails between myself and bozowi customer_services have generally been generic and have taken 00_hours to recieve a response .
0	i accepted payment as i was already massively out of pocket and at this point i was willing to accept defeat and write off my entire experience with this dreadful company and even this took 0 days before funds where received in my account .
0	i will never use this company again and would advice others to avoid like the plague !
0	if the management and customer service team where efficient at dealing_with their customers as the individual or team who responds to poor reviews on this site then the company would no doubt be far more successful .
0	** regardless of wether the 0000 number is national or premium_rate you fail to acknowledge the fact that i have incurred further charges as a result of your customer service department leaving my calls unanswered .
0	not even an_apology mr bozowi ?!
0	i can '_t say i '_m surprised .
0	as i '_ve states previously my handset was indeed in a used condition and not pristine , hence_why i did not request a " brand_new " quote .
0	you continue to hide_behind your unclear and hidden terms and conditions !
0	however , your reviews and rating on trust_pilot are clearly a reflection on your company and business style .
0	i recommend you have a look at the pages on this site for mazuma_mobile for example who have an excellent reputation and reviews .
0	i doubt you will remain in business for much longer if you continue to operate your business in such a poor manner .
0	couldn_'_t find anywhere doing a sony_xperia sp for cheap but found mobile_phone checker and it compared the prices of the contract i wanted .
0	really happy with the phone , arrived the next_day , contract all setup and cheap as chips .
0	been a while since i bought from myprotein with getting_married , baby being born and running my business , but got back exercising and got some banana cream spectrum00 as i always struggled with recovery .
0	it '_s awesome , i feel stronger ( creatine probably ), recover faster and although my sweat smells a little weird ( banana cream and sweat ...) i '_m totally sold on the product .
0	last_year i used to take a different product but this recovery one feels_like it does what it '_s meant to .
0	gains in deadlift and squats are much_quicker_than i thought it would be compared to the first few weeks of no supplement with training .
0	it was a pleasant buy .
0	great communication , process time .
0	0_star !
0	!
0	i have used these_guys hundreds of times and only had 0 breakage and 0 lost parcel ... not bad i say !!
0	!
0	i purchased a pacman hoodie for my bro at christmas time 0000 & not only was it an exclusive product but at £_00 . 00 inc delivery i nthink it was a good deal too .
0	ill bear them in mind for the future .
0	the amazon platform is very easy to use & i like the way the site knows you and has reccomendations .
0	the mp0 store is also very convenient and quick .
0	i would like to see them creating jobs for young people - they are a big company and can make a difference to the uks unemployment problem .
0	i recently_purchased a chauvet gobo 0 . 0 from these_guys and the service and pricing was good .
0	thanks and keep it up !!
0	!
0	very good site and great prices !
0	i love this site its very useful and has helped_me save_money
0	i bought a ibiza 0 . 0 pa sound system which was a real let_down as it was faulty - on new years_eve !!!!
0	( first use )
0	after my huge dissapointment i contacted the company via_email to get it repaired and saldly they said it would be a lengthly period to get it repaired and suggested i got it repaired locally or have a refund , but i had discarded the large boxes it came in so returning it for a refund was not an option .
0	i took it to a repairer & after hifi - tower initially refused to pay the repair quote of £_00 , they then changed their minds and helpfully dealt_with the matter via telephone and offered me all the assistance i needed in order to get the repair paid for .
0	the customer service has_been ok , just a shame the product was faulty upon purchase causing a lot of un - needed stress and dissapointment .
0	they have always been quite helpful and give me good discounts for being a loyal_customer
0	never had any_issues with them , very quick delivery and allways accurate
0	der opstod ingen_problemer , mine varer kom i fin stand , og_de_var hjemme ved mig indenfor 0 - 0_dage .
0	love fra mig af < 0
0	you answered questions i had with a professional attitude .
0	i got my costume in time !
0	the costume was perfect !
0	ok i guess .
0	probably will go somewhere_else next time as their checkout wasn_'_t super clear so my glasses got sent to an old address and i had to re order again .
0	they weren_'_t overly bothered when i told them as the info is all their in checkout .
0	i '_m to blame but i expected a little more understanding in honesty .
0	with no doubts hostelbookers is the best hostel reservation website .
0	i use to travel a lot and i never had problem with the website .
0	high_standard
0	easy to book
0	no fees
0	all their hostel i used to visit are great ( good rating standard )
0	good value , convenient and prompt delivery .
0	would shop there again .
0	i was picked_up 0 0 / 0hrs before my flight for a 0 0 / 0hr journey the airport .
0	after being collected from my hotel the coach driver went on to make 0 stops in the neighbouring resort only to then turn back on himself and go past my hotel .
0	i had been on the coach for 00mins by this point .
0	i had paid for a transfer with a maximum of 0 stops however the coach stopped several_times more than this .
0	when i arrived at the airport because the collection time was so early the check in desk had not even opened .
0	i had to sit in miserable airport when i could have been in my hotel enjoying the final couple of hours of my break .
0	i have contacted the customer service team at resorthoppa four times by email without a reply .
0	not much more to say other than i will buy from them again .
0	i got my screen within a few_days of ordering and the quality is really good , i am very pleased with the overall product and will order more from ballicom in the future .
0	it was even better with the extra 00_% so more for your money , and it came within a few_days .
0	worth it if you either do high intensity sport and are regularly at the gym .
0	my laptop decided to die on me so i wanted to get something that was better , and something that could also play_games at a reasonable graphics level .
0	i was very happy with the price for what i was getting which is the main_reason i bought it .
0	it has_been running well apart_from a couple of hick - ups but apart_from that it is perfect .
0	i would recommend buying from here and i '_m_sure next time i '_m looking for a computer this will be the first site to visit .
0	my order went through quickly , and i was contacted by daniel due to an issue with stock that they had .
0	daniel was open and honest about the mistake and even upgraded my order to special deliver as soon as the watch that i had ordered arrived with them .
0	will_definitely order from these_guys again .
0	i had placed an order online for my partner '_s birthday as she only likes this one type of flower .
0	when the order was received the company has sent me a completely diffrent order which is much_cheaper_than that i had ordered .
0	not acceptable .
0	i ordered some bolle_sunglasses via sportpursuit last month .
0	i got them at a great price and they arrived promptly .
0	i couldnt have asked for any more .
0	am hoping for some good ski kit offers in time for the new season !
0	i found love holidays by searching google - and was delighted with how easy the site is to navigate , and then purchase .
0	prices were great , information up to date - a refreshing start .
0	unfortunately , the faqs on their site did not match up with my experience .
0	the holiday deal was with a ' low_cost airline '.
0	according to the lh faqs , i was to expect my tickets 0 - 00 days before departure .
0	0 days before departure , i called as i had not received these , to be told they needed my passport number before allocating tickets .
0	staff were very friendly and helpful , but i did feel this was not good enough .
0	also , hotel vouchers were sent in an attachment called " invoice . pdf " - i did '_t open it , as you would have expected the file to be named appropriately .
0	so 0 phone_calls which really shouldn_'_t have happened .
0	i '_ve been using quidco for over 0 years_now , and have made cashback of almost £ 0 , 000 on my everyday spending .
0	i find the service extremely easy , and on the rare_occasions where i '_ve needed to make a claim , their instructions are clear .
0	strongly recommended to all my friends and family !
0	very impressed with your product descriptions .
0	items were despatched quickly and efficiently .
0	excellent quality .
0	could not be more impressed .
0	ordered late sunday_evening delivered monday am
0	i ordered a gates tensioner kit and crank pulley for my mondeo as wanapart were the cheapest supplier by far .
0	their staff were most helpful , letting_me know exactly when i could expect to receive my purchases .
0	when the crank pulley turned_out to have been incorrectly manufactured ( not wanapart '_s fault ) they couldn_'_t have been more helpful , sourcing a replacement from an_alternative supplier in germany which would have been on my doorstep within 00_hours of my informing them of the issue but for the courier mis_- delivering the item .
0	when the courier did this wanapart stepped up to the mark and spent quite some time resolving the issue .
0	whist there were issues they were in no way wanapart '_s fault , in fact they were completely beyond wanapart '_s control , yet they still went to great lengths to resolve them .
0	faultless and efficient service .
0	highly_recommended .
0	i would choose talktalkbusiness any day of the week over xln !
0	kirsty on the livechat was v v helpful with me as was the gentleman on the freephone 0000 number .... the best customer service : )))
0	hadn_'_t heard of the company before but received a 00_%_off discount_code from vodafone so decided to give it a go .
0	fantastic range of products to choose from , extremely reasonable prices , fast and free next_day delivery .
0	just cannot find anything negative about the service .
0	would definitely use the company again , as_opposed to the big high_street ones !
0	i '_m new to the e_cig world and tried my first try of e_liquid from you guys , firstly , express delivery next_day to the isle of wight !
0	i thought i ' d have a try of the ciggaweed flavour , it tastes extremely sweet and fruity with a nice amount of vapour , love it !
0	will_continue to order from you always , will be placing more orders for ego and more flavours next week !
0	many_thanks and keep_up the good work !
0	it was like what it said in the details
0	this company has blown my mind with its prices .
0	so affordable for the amount you get .
0	i wouldn_'_t shop with any other company .
0	since being referred to this company i will never even look at another supplement company .
0	this company deserves much praise for what it provides !
0	i have always had a fantastic experience with supplementwarehouse . com .
0	they have very fast shipping at an affordable price .
0	they have a service where they will beat another company '_s price by 0 % which i have personally been able to use .
0	i also always love the free_samples of products as well as the closeouts and clearance items .
0	i highly_recommend this company .
0	i travel a lot and tend to vary my hostel / guest - house booking websites depending on the places fellow_travellers have recommended to me and whether they are advertised on a particular website .
0	i have consistently found hostelbookers to be the easiest , cheapest and most informative website to use .
0	for these reasons it is my preferred choice .
0	it is easy to navigate each page from the homepage / guest - house pages / map layouts etc_etc with clear headers for guidance , in all instances i can remember it was comparatively the cheapest and also not only is the depth of information about each guest - house detailed but also local information is readily_available - and this is almost always reliable as it is not only ratified by yourselves at hostelbookers but by other_travellers who have reviewed , commented and posted about various aspects .
0	i look_forward to continuing to use the hostelbookers website in the future !
0	the whole_process was really straightforward .
0	all they needed was a few bits of info and my phone was unlocked within two_days .
0	very happy !
0	mazuma are faultless , excellent customer service team with a quick start to finish service these_guys are always friendly , would highly_recommend - 0 + stars
0	everyones story is the same with this company , they offer a big amount then cut it down to pennies , then they try to charge you £ 0 . 00 to return the handset - but on mensioning trading_standards or bbc_watchdog they say they '_ll re - look at the handset and give original offer ....
0	bunch of crooks will never use again - best mobile_phone_recycler has to be either mazuma or top_dollar mobile ( professional companies ) - also when trying to call cash0phones with - hold your number or if they have your details they dont answer !
0	ordered a pair of climbing_shoes which arrived swiftly after i ordered them , however they did not fit .
0	i returned them to banana_fingers , but did not receive an email_confirming that they had received them ( even_though royal_mail tracking indicated that the package had been delivered ).
0	it turns_out that the postman had left the package in an unusual place , which i found out with an email that was replied to promptly .
0	my replacement shoes were then despatched to me the next_day .
0	overall great service , and i would recommend your company to others without_hesitation .
0	i wish more companies treated their customers like this !
0	ordered 0000 microsoft_points at 00pm , and the code was in my email inbox by 00 :_00pm - you can '_t ask for more than that .
0	also , the price for the points was very competitive , which led me to the site in the first place .
0	overall , i would unreservedly_recommend this company .
0	i needed to post off a parcel with some speakers which weighed a not - so - small 00kg .
0	at this weight royal_mail becomes ridiculously_expensive , so i looked to couriers for help .
0	firstly i went directly to the couriers , which i ( wrongly ) assumed would be the cheapest thing to do , and my favourite courier is ups .
0	so i logged_onto the ups website and got a quote of £_00 . 00 for them to collect and post my parcel .
0	this was too much for me to pay , so i researched and found this company , parcel0go .
0	so i went_ahead and got a quote from them , and gave_me a huge list with various couriers and varied speeds that my parcel would be delivered .
0	ups were my first choice , and i needed it delivered quickly , so i opted for the express ups service which only set me back £_00 . 00 +_vat ( this was £_00 . 00 for me ).
0	i did initially wonder_how it was so cheap , as it was half the price that ups are offering on their own site !
0	and i assume that parcel0go takes a share of the price i pay !
0	well , i should never have doubted anything as the next_day the ups driver came and collected my parcel , and was delivered the day after .
0	great service !
0	oh but a word of warning , don_'_t use tnt or hermes as they receive a lot of criticism , just pay a couple of quid extra and use dhl or ups !
0	thanks a lot parcel0go !
0	i will_definitely be using you again !
0	like many others , i came into contact with this courier through purchasing off amazon .
0	i ordered a bulky computer case ( weighing a solid 0kg ) and it was delivered within two_days of me purchasing the item , kudos to amazon for the quick dispatch also .
0	however , this courier showed it '_s quality when i wanted to return an item also bought on amazon , they come to your house and collect it straight from you .
0	this went_smoothly with the yodel van turning_up on the correct day and the driver being very helpful , telling_me about how long it would take for my package to be returned to amazon .
0	overall , i couldn_'_t ask for more from a courier !
0	amazon are an indisputably great company , with the right ethos to make it ideal for the customer .
0	their pricing is always very competitive , to the point where you have to look second_hand to get items cheaper ; they offer a great free ' super_saver ' delivery option on all their products which is as speedy as many other_companies paid - for alternatives .
0	another area amazon excel at is refunding purchases , they offer a no questions_asked 00 day guarantee on everything they sell , which they actually keep to ( again much_better_than the competition ).
0	amazon even pay for a courier to collect the item you want to return from your house !
0	you really can '_t get better_than that .
0	however , one thing i would urge you to be wary of is unknowingly buying from random companies through the amazon website .
0	this is very easy to do , with items from amazon themselves looking aesthetically identical to their affiliate counterparts .
0	the way to check is by checking if the item offers the ' amazon free super_saver delivery ' option .
0	if it offers this then the sale is fully completed through amazon themselves .
0	however if you but from a random company , this is like buying the same item off of ebay , albeit a new item off [_external_reference_].
0	give amazon a try , you will soon realise why many people swear by it !
0	i have to admit , the reason i purchased from this company is that i had money in my paypal_account ( from selling on ebay ) and it takes 0 days to transfer money into your bank_account , so i was looking around various speaker sites and found that audiovisual_online accepted paypal ( surprisingly the only speaker company i found that does ).
0	so , i had little choice who to order from , however i am very happy that i stumbled_across this site !
0	as i mentioned earlier the prices they offer are competitive offering the same price as amazon for the speakers i wanted .
0	however , having ordered many thing from unknown sites before , i was expecting a large postage cost be be included with my purchase ( in total the speakers weighed 00kg ) but no , the postage was free !
0	being the skeptical person i am , i was expecting it to be sent by economy post and take a week or more to arrive with me .
0	however this was anything but the case , for free they used dpd '_s next_day premium service !
0	this is a great service , with dpd texting me straight_away telling_me the date when my package would arrive .
0	even better was than on the day of arrival ( i ordered this a 00 at night and it arrived two_days_later !)
0	dpd texted me giving me a 0 hour delivery slot and sure_enough the dpd van turned_up slap_bang in the middle of the slot !
0	i couldn_'_t believe i got this postage service for free , it must have cost audiovisual good money to use that particular service .
0	the condition of the item was perfect , with the box in perfect_condition ( just as it should have been ).
0	i am now enjoying listening to my new speakers !
0	i wouldn_'_t hesitate to use this company again !
0	they would even be in preference to amazon and such like !
0	( yes they are that good !)
0	if only all companies were this good !
0	their new player bonus is genuine .
0	we changed provider from scottish_power to npower in november_0000 .
0	we paid scottish_power by direct_debit and built a credit balance of £_000 by the time we changed .
0	after 00_minutes on their " customer_services " 0000 number (=£ 0 . 00 ) they assured me a cheque ( not a direct transfer ) would be sent within 0 - 00 days .
0	it '_s now 00 days and nothing has appeared - and i '_m typing this while on hold .
0	00_minutes so_far ....
0	i only hope npower is better !
0	fantastic designs , friendly professional staff , and a very clean shop .
0	overall i would highly_recommend blood sweat & ink tattoos .
0	ordered my keys yesterday evening and received them this morning , well above my expectations .
0	i will recommend them to my friends and will buy from them again in future if i need anything .
0	please dont buy stuff from them they are running a scam .
0	i bought a samsung phone 00 june in £_000 . 00 .
0	after ordering i found that they are running scam i send them an email very next_day .
0	got and automatic generated answer from them which was totally_irrelevant answer .
0	next_morning called and have to wait for 0 hour and 0 min .
0	and he asked me reason_why i want to cancel i said i already gave you reason in email he said yeh but we need your reason again .
0	i sent him another email same auto_generated email .
0	then next moring again i called and she said that she have not got received any email and there is no record that i rang and spoke to anyone .
0	she said your order has_been dispatched and i asked here tracking no she said courier will give us in next 0 to 0 days so then she will give me .
0	then i called to moneybookers who are registered here in uk who charged my account on the behalf of them i told them they are running scam and you are the part of this scam and i will take legal_action_against you then they contacted to simply electronic and they refund my money .
0	thanks to allah ( god ) got my money back .
0	stay_away from them .
0	its a scam
0	you can go to local_stores and they just won_'_t beat this site .
0	they match prices and ship super_fast .
0	they also toss in a lot of freebies , samples , and discounted items with most purchases .
0	a - 0 place for supplements .
0	price on website is what you pay , looked at other instant delivery sites mentioning promotions that dont work .
0	plain simple price advertised is what you pay and instant delivery !
0	note some website say this but will list weekends orders may take 00_hours to complete , onlycdkeys . com mean instant and 00 / 0
0	really pleased - from finding the right size , ordering and even fitting was all easy to do / find on the website .
0	set clear timeframes on when i should received items and stick to it .
0	says it all in the title !
0	beware of less well_known recycling_firms who offer you more money as they invariably then offer you a lower offer when they receive the phone - no issues like that with muzumba .
0	i paid iflorist for flowers from their " same day " range , the flowers finally arrived 0 days_later ( after i had cancelled them for not arriving ).
0	my mother explained to the florist that they had been cancelled so the florist said they would be free as it was their mistake .
0	other than an offer to look into the issue when i cancelled the flowers for going awol and an assurance someone would contact me within_00hrs ( a week_ago ) iflorist have ignored my communications during the last 00 days .
0	i wont let it drop but please everyone avoid this company , anyone can make a mistake and fail to deliver , i know they reply on florists .
0	however then to ignore their own customers complaint is unforgivable .
0	fortunately my mother has forgiven me for seemingly missing her_birthday .
0	supplement_warehouse has the best competing prices on the market .
0	everything i want and more with great deals , free stuff , and timely shipping .
0	have tried numerous other_websites and this is by far the best .
0	supplement warehouses price match_guarantee saves me money every time i shop !
0	i found rattan_direct on google , their easy to use website was vey formative .
0	they had a great range of furniture and were very well priced .
0	when i made my order the delivery date was very flexible and they sent a txt to confirm a delivery window .
0	it all arrived on time and both me and my wife were very pleased with our purchase !
0	we had one hiccup but this was resolved with no charge and sorted the next_day .
0	i would highly_recommend rattan_direct to anyone .
0	i certainly would recommend power_tools direct , simple to use site , very good value and quick and prompt delivery service .
0	never bought flowers to deliver online before and even as a novice i managed to find what i wanted and add / change bits to suit .
0	i did notice 0 different sets of flowers with £_00 difference in the price tag both had the same picture - which made things confusing .
0	maybe update your pics ?!
0	!
0	otherwise all good .
0	ps - search for a discount_code online - i manged to get free delivery worth £ 0 . 00 !
0	this is my favorite company to use for buying hair and salon equipment .
0	i have always been one to hunt_around for the best deal but nearly all of the time coolblades has the lowest_price tag .
0	i highly_recommend .
0	the transactions are super easy to use and so convient to shop on .
0	i would recommend this site to anyone who takes suppliments of any kind .
0	thank_you
0	supplementwarehouse
0	where have you been all my life
0	i have been ordering products from aria for many_years .
0	steve and the sales_team are highly knowledgeable and a great company to work with fulfilling our i . t .
0	outsourcing requirements for components .
0	having never_heard of the site before i was a tad anxious to purchase .
0	however .... my mind was put at ease instantly , with great communication , great prices and super_fast shipment .
0	i bought a ticket off a very well_known site previous to buying this ticket and this other site proved to be a liability , extortionate and a poor communicator .
0	double0tickets you are a hidden_gem !!
0	! a +++++
0	daniel evans
0	ordered a number of things from made . com for my new home .
0	had a couple of items delayed by a few weeks until i got the keys , which was done by their helpful callcentre staff .
0	actually the quality of the callcentre employees was generally good .
0	items arrived on time , shipped by either dpd or a specalist " heavy move " courier and were as_described .
0	overall sportsbikeshop offers a reasonable selection of products at a competitive price .
0	the selection overall is not as good for parts as it is for clothing , luggage and other general accessories .
0	very speedy and professional company !!
0	would recommend to eveyone !
0	!
0	supplementwarehouse . com has the lowest_prices on the web for all of your bodybuilding_supplements !
0	i '_ve shopped a lot of sites and this one is by far the cheapest and you get your products quick .
0	simply the best company i have used
0	got the price advertised transferred_into my account the day after_posting my old phone !
0	what can i say about this company ?
0	quite a lot they always deliver promptly even_though i use the super_saver delivery option it always nearly gets to me in 0 days .
0	i used to be worried_about shopping online but when buying from amazon uk , you can shop with confidence and in this day and age everything is 0 times out of 00 cheaper online which is also great .
0	its always helpful that amazon allow you to read_reviews from other customers that have bought the item so you can think_twice before you buy .
0	ordered from them for the first time and then i wanted the delivery faster_than 0 - 0days so they happily changed it to a premium delivery for me and was very helpful lady on the phone that assisted_me .
0	i was kept up to date on my order and emailed details all the way .
0	would i buy again ?
0	yes .
0	if you are about to run out of mot , i suggest contacting servicing_stop ltd .
0	they have one of the cheapest and professional services around .
0	if there is something wrong with the car , they will take care of that too .
0	i can ’_t say enough good things about them .
0	very recommended !
0	cheap products and good quick despatch .
0	would happily use again .
0	i took my macbook_pro in to the leeds store with a faulty battery .
0	it came back with a non - working airport card which they claimed , laughably , no_longer existed , the screen peeling away from the hinges and the hard - drive no_longer working and needing replacing .
0	absolutely_disgusting and embarrassing service and the fact that the people in the shop are all so nice makes it even more sickening that they have ruined my incredibly expensive laptop .
0	pathetic .
0	i bought tickets through double0tickets for muse @ 00 and it was hassle_free and they done exactly_what it said on the tin .
0	they were competitively_priced in comparison to other similar companies and delivery was spot on .
0	a friend recommended this to me and we both bought wildstar on here for cheaper_than it was currently on site !
0	the only reason i was disappointed was because on steam i ordered sniper_elite 0 only to later come_across this site and see it for cheaper , but we got wildstar together and sometime soon elder_scrolls online too !!
0	great service , quick and easy :)
0	i mean , the ordering was easy .
0	i then had to go on my other e_- mail to verify which i was okay with as it is added_security .
0	but putting the code upside_down ?
0	i mean , i put a w as an m . ' incorrect code '.
0	i don_'_t see how having the code upside_down adds to security .
0	i have ordered decadent e_- liquid both for myself and for friends , and we have all been delighted with the quality of the product .
0	some of my favourite flavours come from their range ( the lemon meringue , blackcurrant ice and green giant all come with my hearty recommendation ) and the delivery service from the website is reasonably swift , even on large orders .
0	add to this the money - off coupons they frequently post on facebook and you '_ve got a must - try vape store .
0	i '_ve ordered several_times and always receive my order quickly .
0	the prices can '_t be beat and i love the free mixers that come with your order .
0	great value !
0	mazuma is excellent , great friendly , trustworthy company and highly been recomended to any one who_wants to get_rid of thier old_phones , easy and really simple to use excellent

0	i had a representative come round to my house saying the government are offering you a low monthly plan of £_00 . 00 a month at a fixed rate till 0000 and i asked will this go up he said no its fixed till 0000 so i thought this was a good offer as i was already paying £_00 . 00 for gas and £_00 . 00 electric a week , so i took this offer up in november_0000 , come june_0000 i had a letter from eon saying my monthly direct_debit was going up to £_000 . 00 a month from £_00 . 00 i was discuseted , as this was supposed to be a fixed rate till 0000 , im a single mother on benefits with a low income , thats_why i took the offer up in the first place , ive already contacted watchdog at the bbc and going to the citezens advice please be aware do not be scammed by eons offers change providers i will never go back to eon again !
0	i ordered a new desktop off the arbico website and found it very easy to use with many customisable_options .
0	the system itself that i chose was great value for money , as were several other systems listed on the site .
0	after ordering , you are kept up to date with every_stage of the testing / preparation of your new system with regular_emails and you are also given several options of delivery dates .
0	my pc arrived dead on time and any follow - up queries i had were dealt_with via_email in a matter of minutes .
0	highly_recommended !
0	honestly i was sketchy at first , but the order was quick , simple and perfect , got my game & currently playing , excellent service !
0	i would reccomend simplygames to everyone as it stands_out from other_websites .

0	for over a month , i have a horribly slow sometimes disconnecting internet_connection .
0	i '_ve called customer service three_times and every time they promise me they are working on it .
0	i had to buy bt wifi access for 0 quid a day for the last 0_weeks , because they can '_t even tell me when the fix will be available !
0	in the meantime i continue paying my monthly_bill .

0	how can a fix take a month ??
0	as soon as my contract_ends , i leave three to never come_back and tell this to all my friends !
0	havent got anything , will be getting a refund asap
0	in the past i '_ve always gone with various manufacturers laptops but could never get one with the specs i want until i discovered pc_specialist .
0	i ordered a optimus 0 laptop with exactly the spec i wanted but none of the usual fluff ( i had my own copy of windows , security software and didn_'_t want a dvd_drive )
0	the turnaround from ordering to appearing at my door was 0 days .
0	i '_ve been using the laptop for around 0_weeks now and have upgraded the ram and swapped one of the harddisks for an ssd ( pc_specialist maintain the warranty too with user installed upgrades ).
0	the laptop runs warm whilst gaming so a cooling pad is recommended .
0	overall a good experience and will_definately buy my my next laptop from pc_specialist .
0	i have been using supplementwarehouse . com for a number of years_now .
0	i have nothing but praise for the the quality of products and customer service i have received each and every time i have ordered from them .
0	i have yet to find a supplement company that even comes_close to the selection offered by supplementwarehouse . com .
0	from the minute i click send , i have no doubt that my order will be shipped in an expeditious manner .
0	further , i have the piece of mind that there will not be a lower price , thanks to their price beating system .
0	i would recommend supplementwarehouse . com to any and everyone looking for high_quality products at the absolute best prices .
0	helt suveren service , og_meget gode_priser !

0	i can '_t get netflix where i live and it annoyed me that thousands of streamed movies and tv shows were so close within my grasp but so_far away .
0	strongvpn allows me to connect my computer to the us and get netflix !
0	their service is amazing , the speeds are always great , the customer service is amazing .
0	i am talking to someone within 0 - 0 minutes on their website and i love that they will let_me switch to other cities or even countries when i want to watch something else .
0	i have recommended strongvpn to a number of friends who have gotten the service and are also very impressed .
0	i can '_t recommend them enough !
0	i order a few cd '_s at the beginning of december as christmas_presents , they hadn_'_t arrived after a couple of weeks so i emailed there customer_support .
0	i heard_nothing back but a few_days_later i had my cd '_s on my doorstep with the word priority written all over them , make of that as you will .
0	don_'_t think i would be using this site again even if they are a few_pounds_cheaper .
0	i have used this site a few_times and every time the order arrives quickly and with out fuss .
0	having had trouble ordering the same product with dell i gave uk digital_cameras a try .
0	they did not disappoint it arrived the next_day well_packed and i am very pleased with the service i have received , plus it was the very cheapest price on the net .
0	no_complaints here .
0	when selling my mobile i used a comparison site and mazuma came out as offering the best price .

0	my new blomberg oven was recently_purchased from and installed by buywise , it arrived with no issues on the agreed delivery date .
0	i am very pleased with it and with the service provided .
0	i was also impressed with the competitive_prices offered .
0	i have used supplementwarehouse . com multiple_times for my supplement_needs , and i '_ve never been disappointed .
0	fast price matching , great freebies , and excellent shipping make this site a true winner for anyone looking to pick_up supplements .
0	my only_suggestion would be to make the website a little more streamlined for product ordering ( the scrolling_through supplements and multiple pages is a bit tedious , but it certainly isn_'_t a deal_breaker ).
0	overall , this is my go - to site for purchasing supplements .
0	don_'_t hesitate to use it !
0	this is the first time i have used this company and i am very impressed . they keep you informed every_step of the way and i received my item the next_day . highly_recommended to all .
0	i ordered an item from amazon on saturday and chose the free super_saver delivery option . on sunday i got an email_stating that the item had been dispatched to yodel for delivery and i should expect to receive my item on thursday .
0	having never_heard of yodel before i googled them and came_across this review site . after_reading the mostly one star reviews i got worried that i might never see my item .
0	monday came so i thought i would check the tracking_number . the parcel had moved about 000_miles but in the totally opposite direction from me , this concerned me a little .
0	tuesday_morning i checked the tracking_number to find the parcel was in my area and out for delivery . i thought , great . around 0 :_00pm knock at the door . it '_s here problem free .
0	this is my first experience of yodel and i have found them to be perfect in every way , even receiving my parcel two_days earlier_than_expected . big_thumbs_up from me .
0	i have been using amazon for years . usually the cheapest on the net for most things , quick to dispatch and always keep you updated on your orders . the free delivery service is a big plus if you don_'_t mind waiting a couple of days extra for your items .
0	always first_class service from my local dominos ( kilmarnock ). very easy to order either online or by phone . very quick delivery and always hot and delicious . i love the money off vouchers i get through the mail , makes the prices quite reasonable .
0	even_though this was a low value order it was still dispatched very quickly , was well_packed and free delivery . highly_recommended . a ++++++
0	i ordered some flavours for plain e_- liquid , which is hard to find at a reasonable price with a trusted company .
0	liberty_flights had an array of flavours to choose from , at a surprisingly cheap price considering the quality .
0	topped_off with a fast delivery , it '_s now my go - to website for e_- cigs .
0	highly_recommend this site !
0	i purchased products on next_day delivery - paying a premium to be delivered to a business address .
0	the first " attempted delivery " according to yodels tracking was 0pm ?!?
0	the following_day .
0	this is stupid enough but it claims a card was left .
0	no card was left .
0	i checked the cctv , there was no attempted delivery .
0	first lie from the driver .
0	yodel confirmed that the driver had not been in the area .
0	the next_day , i ring up express my displeasure .
0	i was to receive a call from manchester depot that morning .
0	no call .
0	second lie .
0	i call back to find out what is going on .
0	i am told , that they will message the driver , the parcel is on a van and i will have it before 0 : 00 that day .
0	third lie .
0	there was no attempted delivery that die .
0	day 0 - i ring up .
0	staff tell me that are in contact with driver , he is aware that its to be with me that day asap to hit 0pm_deadline ( for a secret_santa ).
0	delivery was attempted at 0pm that night !!!!
0	what do they not understand !.
0	a card was supposedly left - it wasn_'_t .
0	i will check cctv , i am 00_% confident that no delivery was attempted .
0	yodel are a joke .
0	twice booked a hotel in oxford and got a booking_reference e_- mailed .
0	twice , a few hours_later , the booking was cancelled by alpharooms .
0	no explanation .
0	you can '_t do_business like this .
0	also the rooms went up in price the second time of trying to book .
0	waited in all day .
0	then saw note .
0	they couldn_'_t be_bothered to call .
0	quicker to leave a note at residential addresses so drivers can get their round done in time .
0	0000 numbers won_'_t let you speak to a human .
0	had to call a collection number and tap in a false account number ( obviously not recognised ) so system would transfer me to a human .
0	couldn_'_t deliver parcel that day .
0	they could deliver the next_day and leave in a safe_place .
0	i said front_doorstep will be fine ( secluded house ) they said they couldn_'_t do that .
0	i would have collectd in my town ( northampton ) but to save cash they are located in rushden so nowhere_near the main population of the county .
0	catherine very polite & helpful service will use again .
0	i have t - mobile connection ( sim ) and i have been a long time customer .
0	what i like about t - mobile connection ?
0	good connectivity and decent customer service .
0	ordered colonial marines on the friday and received on the monday , which is day before release_date .
0	extremely pleased at getting day before .
0	bought a graphics_card from them , about £_000 at the time .
0	had no issues with purchase and delivery and was pleased with the company at the time but when the card developed a fault after about a year ( 0 year_warranty ) so i had to post back , at my expense with no offer or refund there , and the replacement time was 0_weeks with zero word from them during .
0	i find zero communications really bad for such a long repair / replacement time .
0	when i phoned up 0_weeks in i was told a replacement was sent out same day so waited a week only to learn i was lied to .
0	disgusting for a company to lie to it '_s customers !
0	the replacement card was faulty , failed under load which seemed to be a known fault from looking on random forums ( amd 0000 ).
0	fair_enough , this sort of thing happens but i '_ve been told that i should expect it to be 00 days due to time of year .
0	not ' up to ' 00 days but the full 00 days .
0	i am so appalled about this companies after service i will not purchase from them again and i recommend the members in my gaming clan to do the same .
0	netflix is brilliant for me and perfect that you can restrict access for the kids .
0	i have always had brilliant service from netflix !
0	the very few_times i have contacted customer service they have been on the ball .
0	tonight i spoke to a lady ( katya ) on the live_chat team and she was brilliant , extremely friendly and definitely made me feel a valued_customer .
0	with 0000 '_s of hours of tv shows and movies where else would you go for the low price .
0	keep doing an awesome job guys .
0	regards ,

0	this site was advertised on my facebook news feed so i clicked to view as me an the other half have recently developed a like for cooking " different " tastes in the kitchen .
0	i ordered wok the book to start with as , as far as i can tell this was a fairly new site .
0	it took 0 days for the book to arrive after_placing my order on a sunday at 00pm , i was very please with the fast service and will be placing future orders .
0	i have noticed that within a week of visiting the site the variety has almost_doubled .
0	recommend to anyone whos go ( ing ) spicey in the kitchen !
0	:)
0	thanks again
0	other than what is stated in the title i think the site and company provides great marketing to it customers and gives them great deals on products needed for those who are trying to get into a better shape then they were .
0	over all great website and business .
0	very simple and easy process !
0	huge_selection of products and the prices are very competitive with the other supply stores .
0	the ordering_process is easy and quick .
0	i have been ordering from supplement_warehouse for a while now and will_continue to use them .
0	merlin had a great deal on .
0	they answered a question i had before i made the order and delivered quickly afterwards .
0	supplement_warehouse has great prices and a quality selection , they will match prices on anything and give you an extra discount .
0	fast shipping i have no_complaints .
0	our loved father and grandfather in portugal passed away recently .
0	since we are in south_africa , it was not enough time to attend the funeral but we did order flowers online and within the next_day flora_queen delivered them .
0	they were a beautiful_bouquet , and even looked better_than the picture on their website .
0	the flowers helped bring joy and comfort to our family .
0	the service was great and professionally presented .
0	everything that was requested was there and definitely worth the money .
0	it was money well spent and we have since told a few family_members and friends to use flora_queen next time for excellent quality and professionalism .
0	thank_you once again flora_queen , you helped make this difficult transition in our_lives easier and the beautiful_flowers helped make our family '_s day a little_bit brighter .
0	i book a hostel with them , went to the property , paid cash , and everything_went well .
0	then i found out that the property , who i never gave my credit_card_details had charged it again .
0	since i never gave them my card_details , only hostelbookers could have done it -- even_though they supposedly make the booking by paying the 00_% and not the credit_card .
0	i contact their customer_care to find out , and they totally_ignored me .
0	they didn_'_t even bother to reply my messages .
0	so did the hostel .
0	in the end i could only get my money back through my bank in a long and painful process , since hostelbookers failed to provide any of the documents the visa company requested :-(.
0	i never had a worse experience with a booking system !
0	previously bought battlefield_0 limited_edition , just bought shogun 0 ... cheaper_than steam and instant service .. what more can you ask for ?
0	to be honest , i am very new to the supplement / workout arena .
0	however , i believe that as a newcomer to the game there are some differences that separate me from those who have been in this arena for a long time .
0	i believe that as a newcomer i am not blinded by any bias .
0	i can look at different companies and websites and compare them objectively .
0	although i am sure that people have had troubles and shortcomings with different sites and different companies for whatever_reason , as a first - time buyer i do not have any of these prior ideas that taint my mind .
0	who_knows , maybe in a couple weeks my view of this company might have changed for the worst , although i hope that is not the case .
0	however , in comparing different sites and different companies , i believe that supplementwarehouse is the most upfront , direct , and truthful company when it comes down to pricing and their service towards making_sure you get what you are looking for at the price you want it .
0	the one thing that bothered me initially was that shipping to my particular residence was $_00 and i believed this was absurd .
0	yet , what they claimed ( and was true ) was that the price that other_sites / companies offer with free shipping or lower shipping_costs was lower_than the $_00 shipping + price of the products on their site .
0	although i only compared the certain products i was buying , i bet this is true for a large variety of items on their site .
0	another thing that i really enjoyed was that they had these packages at checkout $_00 . 00 or $_00 . 00 or $_00 . 00 which all offered different things .
0	but the greatest thing was , if you bought this package you got a credit towards your shipping .
0	why not get all these free things when you have to pay the same amount for shipping anyways ?
0	anyways , i am happy with this company and i hope that this transaction goes through smoothly so that i can continue to purchase from this company in the future .
0	superb !
0	cheapest by far of any retailers .
0	happy for us to return item if not satisfied .
0	receieved within two_days of order .
0	fantastic overall exeprience of using this company and would definitely recommend .
0	good customer service .
0	fast delivery
0	i was so impressed , i knew there would be extra shipping as i was in the channel_islands but as it turned_out the vat refund was more than the shipping cost so i woke_up to find a refund in my paypal_account already !
0	excellent communication from the store , would recommend to anybody !
0	i was acturely put off after_reading the bad review on this page but i decided no i will go for it .
0	first i acturely phoned to check items where in stock and got a lot of help on the phone on the items i wanted and how they would sound ( speakers ) and all questions i had where answerd very well i acturely orderd after 0 and i still got my items next_day cant get any better really .
0	have allready recommendid to all my mates and will_definetly use again many many_thanks .
0	i '_ve bought a few items from bureau_direct and had great service on every occasion .
0	they stock some really nice & unique products and they remain as one of my favourite online stationary suppliers .
0	just received the charles_eames style rar rocking chair for kids .... the chair looks brilliant and the finish is outstanding .
0	what a great welcome present for the arrival of my niece .
0	as you can see from the picture my cat has taken ownership of the chair and i might have to get a second one !
0	we also bought a charles_eames hang it all a few_months_ago ...
0	quality and customer service are consistent and we will definitaly purchase again !
0	:)
0	bought some nike roshe sneaker boots .
0	0_star service !
0	turned_up a day before the expected delivery date .
0	will use again !
0	took months to get a reply back after having a pair of gazelle og trainers fail after 0 hours of use .
0	support_team where unhelpful and not interested in listening to the problems i encountered .
0	i won_'_t buy anything adidas again after this , they don_'_t seem to be_bothered about losing long_term loyal_customers !
0	customer service is non - existent !
0	had a pair of adidas gazelle trainers that tore on the inside of the heel after a few hours use , after returning them i was told it was not a manufacturing_fault and they would not replace them .
0	going to contact trading_standards and see what can be done about it .
0	i would advise nobody to use scotts or jd_sports .
0	it took two months to finally get a refund emailing them everyday !!!

0	good company .
0	if you have not heard of the steam sale get on it !
0	( only runs for two_weeks a few_times each year ) last time i got twelve games for around twenty_pounds .
0	some of those were recently released games as well .
0	had a few letters go missing in the post this year , they offer no compensation for missing items apart_from some stamps !
0	so my stuff can go missing in the post again huh_?
0	to cut as long_story_short i bought a steelseries keyboard that had faulty keys , they offered to send some new ones in the post that never turned_up !
0	after writing a few more angry messages and promising to never use / buy steelseries again they sent me a better keyboard than the model i had .
0	this was more than a fair compensation !
0	can '_t complain !
0	were not as helpful as they could have been when i had problems !
0	won_'_t use again !
0	very good service !
0	only ever had one problem which was resolved by the customer service team !
0	i love the prices and the freebies that go with the order !
0	will buy from again !
0	yesstyle is a great company , everything always comes fast with no trouble !
0	ordering is great , and the clothes are super cute .
0	love yesstyle !
0	i always order from them !!
0	!
0	this site has the lowest_prices of any other site i '_ve came_across .
0	although the shipping can be expensive it usually still comes out cheaper_than most competitors .
0	i '_ve never had a problem with supplementwarehouse , it is always the first place i look for supplements and usually the only one .
0	first_port of call when i order new gear they stock the best dj_equipment and the prices are very competitive !
0	great service and speedy delivery would definitely recommend to anyone looking to get new kit
0	i wanted to take my girlfriend on a trip for christmas and expedia had all the options that i wanted to check out , gave fairly straight_forward options for changing my search parameters and the flight & hotel option was exactly_what i needed .
0	changing flight times , airports and booking the hotel , checking suites , different costs etc was extremely easy and to be perfectly honest expedia made me feel_confident about what i was purchasing .
0	on top of this i had some credit_card issues and the call_centre was extremely_helpful .
0	i placed an order and was told it would take 00days to be delivered .
0	it is now late so i went on live_chat to find out were it was as the dhl_tracking site has not been updated since it was ordered .
0	the women i spoke to ' cat woman chloe ' was as unprofessional as her name .
0	she basically argued with me that it is not late at all because it has arrived at customs in my country which is what the delivery day estimation is about .
0	so according to her it takes 00 days to get it to customs then once its there they don_'_t care what happens to your product if it gets to you or not .
0	i assume happy people on this site are from america because uk orders .... pointless .
0	i ordered a product but picked the wrong_size so contacted them and was able to resolve the issue easily with no_complications or delay .
0	after a few_years of getting my protein from this company i was very happy until i had a missing product .
0	i had an attachment to my order saying it would be shipped when in stock .
0	after a while i tried to contact the company to see when my product would come .
0	after 0 emails to customer_services and 0 months on i am still_waiting on my product i paid for .
0	thankfully it wasn_'_t of high value but i will be sure to no_longer use this company encase something else is not in stock as you seem to get charged for the items but never receive them .
0	shocking .
0	they have only actually been in touch since this review ?
0	y does it take a review like this to get a response from the company ?
0	get in contact is all they have done also as they informed me they were resolving the issue by sending me my products , however after waiting 0_weeks for an order which should as informed by them take no_longer_than 0 - 0 days i realise it was a lie to shut me up .
0	i have again contacted them but as usual there is no response !
0	!
0	the site was great and the process was easy from_start to finish .
0	follow this up with quick delivery and an ecxellent case - i really can '_t fault my experience .
0	i do like pizza from the hut so can knock the food for what it is ........ but the website seems to always have problems with the page timing out at checkout , resulting in having to try and re order 0 or 0 times before it goes though .
0	been using them for 0 years_now , and never had a problem !
0	really love being_able to collect , and use the seeds year after year without the phenotype lottery of using f0 seeds .
0	this company has many hard to find transistors , ic , and valves for your audio needs .
0	service was so good iv place 0 orders in the last 0_weeks , and they saved me weeks of tracking down vintage parts .
0	very helpful staff , could not recommend them any more highly
0	ordered a epiphone the dot eb ch as a gift for a friends birthday , dissipate being in germany the price was the lowest i could_find even with paypal exchange_rate !
0	only got here in 0 days , and was extremely well_packaged .
0	i plan to use them again , and would recommend to a friend !
0	have used musikding 0 times now , and each order has got from germany to england in under a week , well_packed and with email_updates !
0	they also have some hard to find value capacitors .
0	would certainly recommend !
0	ordered a box of jars that were very competitively prices , received them on - time and well_packed .
0	will_definitely recommend and use again !
0	i use rapid at_least once a month and have yet to have a problem with any_aspect of their service .
0	postage is fast and free ( on orders over £_00 ), and very well_packed !
0	ebay is a wonderful website that i use every day , thinks to the site i have been able to start my own business with very few overheads , and find their pricing very reasonable as a seller .
0	all the disputes iv head with them as a buyer and seller have been handled very well , and they can not be held_responsible for the conduct of all there users , though it would be nice if sellers could go back to leaving negative_feedback where necessary .
0	only_downside is there constant efforts to change " my ebay " the latest changes included putting the " selling " section on another page , removing it for the general overview page ........ in context its only one extra click to check your selling items !
0	switch over to tesco for my weekly_shop a couple of months back , and have not had a single problem with delivery , alternatives or damaged goods .
0	the drivers have always been really helpful , even helping to carry the good up to my third floor_flat .
0	the layout of the website took a little_bit of getting used to , and it would be nice to be able to narrow_down the searches to " own - brand " or list by cheapest .... but perhaps they are included features i '_m just missing how to use ?
0	have never had a problem getting media or games for play , but a couple of times orders from their gifts and gadgets have taken longer then the cds / dvds to arrive , and once was not in stock despite taking the order online .
0	would be happy to used them again as the competitive_prices out weigh deliver times !
0	iv used amazon lost over the last couple of year from physical goods to downloadable content and have yet to be let_down in any way .
0	prices are competitive , delivers are secure and refillable and customer service were helpful and informed !
0	also like thire free application for kindleoooks making the reader free across all the main platforms !
0	have used mazuma several_times for cheap and expensive phones .
0	each time no_hassle and payment received ( cheque ) the following_day after being received by mazuma .
0	this time i tried the payment direct through my bank_account and this service was excellent .
0	payment was transferred to my bank same day mazuma received my phone .
0	i have used mazuma a long time and will do for a long time to come ... excellent
0	the prices are a little high , but considering there is major under - provision of japanese food products in supermarkets in the uk , it '_s not a big deal .
0	the delivery was fast , the items good quality , and website / transaction smooth and simple !
0	will be ordering again .
0	why not to buy from cpw
0	i am interested in learning more about the 00 days refund / return_policy with cpw and what the implications are of a forced repair service .
0	also interested in how / why cpw complaints staff put themselves forward as legal professionals offering biased legal_advice and opinions on behalf of cpw .
0	as far as i know the supply of goods_act ensures a manufacturer '_s warranty and the sales of goods_act gives use time to accept goods of satisfactory quality .
0	when purchasing a brand_new phone , things such as durability cannot possibly be tested and if a touch_screen becomes unresponsive in under 0 months of initial purchase it is up to cpw to prove it was not faulty from point of sale .
0	does any act or law give cpw the legal right to change what i thought was six_years ( reasonable time ) to 00 days ?
0	does cpw have the legal right to prove faults on a phone did not exist from point of sales because the customer did not ring every day to report the problem with in the first 00 days ?
0	do cpw have the right to unbox , activate and flick_through menus ( demonstration ) at point of purchase with no consent from buyer ( may want to leave it boxed )?
0	situation is being sold a phone in just over four months_ago that did have a laggy screen but not wanting to be a " naggy " customer - put up with it and eventually saw the screen deteriorate over time and become unresponsive .
0	when going to the store i was told i have to accept a loan phone ( shared by most of uk ) which was not even a smart device ( no email / apps ) - both unhygienic and inconvenient for me .
0	this was insisted upon but i refused .
0	i expected to be offered a replacement instead but this did not happen .
0	i would have been happy with a 000_% clean smartphone loan phone but this was refused .
0	when calling complaints , the advisor i spoke to told me he was the head trainer for consumer_law in the department .
0	he spent 00_mins telling_me how he could offer refund / replacement if he wanted but did not want to .
0	instead he advised me to check a ' which website ' to revise my consumer_rights .
0	advised i have no legal right to " not accept " or " reject " the goods based on the fault as the warranty superseded my statuary rights .
0	after giving up on trying to communicate the inconvenience to cpw i unfortunately decided to write up a letter of rejection ( after about 0 phone_calls & 0 store visits ) asking for a full_refund ( as_opposed to a better loan phone or replacement ) which will be with cpw soon .
0	quite a horrible experience but now waiting to hear back from them .
0	if you have struggled to get a replacement / refund in the first six_months of purchase , it would be interesting to know how cpw dealt_with the fault .
0	it seems like cpw profit from insisting on using manufacturer warranties as_opposed to using the contract entered ( soga ) then forcing customers into repairs , not having to replace or refund the item or even offering it as an option past the first 00 days .
0	other_retailers have not ever done this and surely buying a phone off cpw must be a negative / counter - productive task .
0	bought a hsf a short while back and cant_complain_about the service and goods .
0	picked it up off their d0t which offered it at a better price than its competitors .
0	it arrived quickly and the site is simple to nagivate along with a great community .
0	cant_fault them and would highly_recommend .
0	really good service , was quick and easy to use , saved me £_00 as got quoted £_00 before hand but so relieved i had found this site as it was such a simple process
0	i would love to recommend simplygames as their prices are extremely good and they appear to run a very tight_ship but this simply isn_'_t the case .
0	after receiving my product code to be activated on origin i was surprised to find it didn_'_t work , so i thought i ' d just send them an email asking if they could maybe sort this out for me .
0	that was over a week_ago , they haven_'_t got back to me , what they did email to me however was this chance to submit a review about them .
0	so yeah , thanks for stealing my £_00 simplygames .
0	always been used to using steam , but now i think i '_ll go to cjs_cd_keys first before i go_anywhere_else .
0	bought a newly_released game the deluxe special_edition for over half the price from elsewhere , and i '_m really happy with my purchase .
0	once you ' re verified and get used to the purchasing system which is not complicated by any means , you ' re all set to go .
0	would recommend to anyone .
0	thanks cjs !
0	:)
0	everything you ' d expect and more .
0	i ordered the television on boxing_day , and had no less_than 0 phone_calls between then and delivery ( on the 00th_december ) to confirm the order and delivery timeframe .
0	the product arrived as advised .
0	it was a great deal and i am thoroughly pleased with both it and the service received .
0	would definitely buy more from their site .
0	great product selection , sales people are very knowledgeable and always willing to help .
0	i shop in the store and online and have had nothing but positive_experiences .
0	would highly_recommend them to anyone - best cycling / triathlon store in the uk
0	very good product , with very fast delivery .
0	one of the best companies i '_ve bought tech from , wouldn_'_t buy from any other else .
0	they have some of the best customer service i '_ve ever used , and they ' re very quick at replying .
0	can '_t rate them highly_enough .
0	lily dressed in her " where '_s wenda " outfit made us all giggle and she wants to wear it all the time now .
0	may have a professional comedian in training .
0	the quality was reasonable and delivery arrived the next_day after ordering .
0	highly_recommended .
0	based on a single order this site is excellent , good price and timely delivery especially given i ordered on a weekend nothing but good stuff to say .
0	i received an e_- mail about a monitor that had gone on offer and when i had a look it was too good to pass up and if i ordered that same day , there was the option of free , next - day delivery
0	i would fully recommend signing_up for the promotional_emails at the very least as there are some very good offers being sent out
0	placed an order friday_morning , by friday_afternoon i got a message_saying that my order had been processed and was being dispatched .
0	arrived on monday .
0	by purchasing from this site , i have found a better and easier way to purchase video_game codes .
0	its great !
0	just a few_clicks of a buttons and bam , i '_ve got the code .
0	no_hassle , just plain quick deliverly .
0	great deal , quick delivery .
0	definitely recommend .
0	they ' re really helpful and they even phoned me up to help me pick the parts that i needed .
0	they gave_me a call a few_days after i had received the parts to check that i was happy and continued to help me and answer any questions that i had .
0	i '_ve just started_using aria but i will be sticking around !
0	00 / 00
0	will_certainly be making use of cjs_cd_keys again , it '_s a piece of cake to order and get your key and the prices are a bargain ...
0	by far the cheapest quality supplements i '_ve find anywhere !
0	i would definitely refer a friend !
0	i love love supplement_warehouse and get all my supplements from them
0	ordered my playstation 0 a few week before official launch in uk , got mine on the release day and didn_'_t have to wait a month to get one , had no issues with contacting them when i needed help , they always contacted me and got to the point , no excuses that were given to me , they just replied very fast and was very happy with my order !
0	!
0	thank_you simply_games !!!
0	epic company
0	placed an order with tekshop000 on 00th_jan_0000 - for sony htsa 0 . 0 home_cinema kit £_000 . 00 .
0	item then goes out of stock and awaiting new stock .
0	get an email late last night that they are cancelling my oder as sony has increased the price to over £_000 .
0	why the hell would they take an order in the first place when they dont have stock .
0	i could have got it from another supplier for £_00 more .
0	i ordered a product on december 00th .
0	after not receiving it by early_january , i contacted the company via e_- mail and they replied_saying it would be despatched that week .
0	the following week , the order '_s status on their site was still " being prepared ".
0	i e_- mailed again to find out what was going on and had no reply .
0	i e_- mailed once more and , again , had no reply .
0	luckily i had paid via_paypal so was able to open a dispute with them .
0	my money was refunded in a couple of days and the company didn_'_t_argue against the dispute i had raised .
0	however , there wasn_'_t even a comment or e_- mail to apologise for the inconvenience .
0	i wish i had checked out sites like this before i ' d made an order .
0	looking at the recent reviews , i wouldn_'_t have gone anywhere_near them if i ' d known beforehand .
0	don_'_t waste your time .
0	the images on the website were detailed enough to get a good impression of what the glasses looked like .
0	the description was relatively detailed , could have done with a bit more on the specific application of each model .
0	the delivery was excellent and quick .
0	overall a very good experience .
0	i ordered a bunch of flowers on 00 march for mothers_day to be delivered on the 00th it is now tuesday 0st april and the flowers still have not been delivered .
0	i have emailed customer_support twice_now but still not got a reply back .
0	it is pointless getting the flowers delivered now as mothers_day as been and gone
0	after looking for an official_iphone_unlock company i have found them an i will be doing more unlocking with u guys very soon thanx
0	a really good service with extremely_helpful staff .
0	an operator called jenny helped_me with an international shipment and looked in depth into a query for me .
0	i will_definitely use again !
0	it '_s hard to trust a cd_key website , but when i decided to order after_seeing so much positive_feedback about this site , i thought i ' d try it , purchased 00 months xbox_live_gold for £_00 ( bargain ), ordered through paypal , within a minute i received email with the cd_key which shows on the back of a card like you would get from retail .
0	i simply redeemed the codes and right away , it worked .
0	legit website , superb prices , awesome job !
0	after going down to my local dreams store i had no idea what i wanted after half an_hour i had purchased 0 beds and one tempa mattress .
0	i opted to have the beds installed as they have the storage underneath and i never wanted all the hassle getting it right .
0	come the morning of delivery had a call to say the guys would arrive at half 0 and they was here on the dot .
0	dave and seb was the installers and i could not fault them at all very polite and professional and cleared up all the mess they made unlike_some company '_s .

0	very quick easy way of getting some cash .
0	fast and reliable company , good quality cables and great value
0	hey there !
0	i highly_recommend you to do not worry to deliver your iphone blindly to official_iphone_unlock ....
0	have purchased two games from cdkeys . com . au
0	one was swtor , the other bf0 .
0	both deliveries were quick , cheap prices , and no_hassle .
0	will be buying all my cdkeys from here
0	i '_ve never found any other hostel booking website to be as efficient , cheap and easy to use as hostelbookers .
0	000_% recommended to use hostelbookers instead of hostelworld !
0	excellent selection .
0	reasonable prices .
0	and cracking customer service when required .
0	definitely buying here again .
0	i am not sure how i came_across this website , maybe a google_search and i found the amazing , money saving deals .
0	the main and most_important_thing on their website is the competition pricing .
0	what this is basically is you go to a different website where its listed for cheaper , supplement_warehouse doesn_'_t just match the price , it gives you it for much less .
0	great website and company , will recommend to friends and family , and use the service again !
0	usually deliveries thats say they are next_day to northern_ireland from england are not , this was , i was quite happy .
0	product arrived in perfect_condition and i got a very polite email which i will quote , " thank_you for your business and of course if i can help further , please don_'_t hesitate to get in touch .
0	kind_regards .." so you can see why i gave this 0_stars
0	i receive my camera in 0 days without paying any aditional charges .
0	ordered a pair of long_distance new wayfare glasses which arrived 0 days of the dispatch date and in total 00 days from order date .
0	the online order progress keeps you informed every_step of the glasses pathway .
0	not a scratch on the lenses and no_problems with my perscription .
0	couldn_'_t find a better price online .
0	my one regret , not selectspecs fault , is that i did not look in the shops at what i was buying online .
0	if i did i would have chosen the colour havanah instead of dark havanah .
0	my fault entirely so guess the motto is try before you buy .
0	easy to use website , fast and secure .
0	collection is easy to organize
0	downside ( very small one but ...), pity collection times can not be more specific than 0am_till_0pm for example ?
0	not parcel0go '_s fault would be a nice addition in my opinion to their website .
0	also a surcharge for using paypal is disappointing as i use ebay and paypal a lot !
0	support staff both on facebook and website all very helpful and knowledgeable , a credit to their employers !
0	trustpilot is a flawed system .
0	you can overide the authorisation_code normally by typing in a sequence of numbers ( 000000 ) or letters ( abcdefg0 ).
0	you can reply as a company even when you are not the company .
0	i cannot understand_why companies are paying good money for such a system .
0	i bet after a few_seconds , this comment will be deleted because trustpilot is also an unmanned system , no body is ever checking .
0	only if it is in the interest of trustpilot .
0	i ordered my canvas from hellocanvas , it came two_days after it was shipped , and it is top quality !
0	add that to the fact it worked out at £_00 - £_00 cheaper_than i could get anywhere in shrewsbury .

0	i like the choices i have while shopping here .
0	they not only have a large_selection of supplements but they are at great values .
0	his products are excellent and the quality is perfect .
0	services also very friendly .
0	wanna save a hella good amount of money use this website bra .
0	i was really impressed with the speed of dispatch , low_cost ( ie , free !)
0	delivery and the lovely saving off the rrp of the lens :)
0	the perfect website for anyone who_likes to have a bet .
0	odds from a wide_range of bookies and best prices are clearly highlighted .
0	also really useful for checking things like historical price changes and statistics for the prices of different bookmakers .
0	i mainly bet on football and horse_racing and just about every market i need is on there .
0	if you bet even just a couple of times a month , you really should be using oddschecker to get best value !
0	never rated a company before on the web .
0	but , price was good ; service was good , arrived on time .
0	only_downside no instructions for the drum stool and hi hat stand was packed in brown_paper and not boxed .

0	very happy with the service .
0	i ordered from elitekeys today as i wanted to get into wow as i have just stopped_playing my other mmo due to it being pay0win .
0	i had a looka round numerous sites for a long time thinking which one is a honest and true trustworthy website to buy from .
0	i stumbled_across elitekeys the website looks professional and not all buy gold buy gold cheap price ect like the other_sites i was looking for game_keys from , i came to here also and read the reviews before purchasing and everything seemed legit .
0	i ordered my copies of the game and after 00_minutes i got an email with attached photo '_s of my game codes which is a more satisfactory idea as you know they are more then likely to be legit and someone hasn_'_t just copied the code into an email and maybe got to code wrong .
0	personally i will be ordering from this website again it is a good reliable_source to buy from professionally set and hassle_free .
0	plus from what i see delivery time is quicker_than the estimate of 00_mins - 0 hours , thats always a bonus !
0	!
0	i really rate these_guys - its very rare that i shop on line and get the feeling like 0 .
0	i '_m dealing_with human_beings and 0 . they care about the customer and are not after a quick buck .
0	i will_definitely shop with these_guys again and i highly_recommend their services to anyone and on top of all this they have great stock which just shows me they know what they are doing .

0	barry '_s an excellent employee who provides his service thoroughly and seems to be the type to go out of his way for a client , that '_s the type of attitude needed to make organizations work .
0	thank_you world bound
0	needed some bankruptcy advice after my debt_management plan failed and found them to be very helpful and sorted my bankruptcy application out for me
0	very easy to use - genuinely the cheapest we found .
0	their customer service through the online " chat " function was excellent and ensured we got just what we needed .
0	very trustworthy and will_definitely use again .
0	i cant_believe_how easy it was to use etyres .
0	one simple phone_call was all it took .
0	the lady on the phone was polite and really helped_me understand what tyres i needed to go for .
0	i made my selection , booked the most suitable day for me , sat back and relaxed .
0	the day of the fitting came .
0	i received a call from the fitter promptly at 0 . 00am who said he would be there at 00am and at exactly 00 . 00am he turned_up .
0	the fitting was done quickly and efficiently , he even took away my old tyres !
0	" all included in the service ," he said .
0	he then asked for my signature , showed me how to tighten my bolts properly and was on his way .
0	the whole_thing took under half an_hour which is an eye_opener compared to the 0 hour wait i suffered at kwick_fit .
0	overall i cannot_fault the prompt friendly and affordable service i received .
0	i was very happy with the case when it arrived . it looks great , you just can '_t get great unique designs like this in the uk .
0	it fitted my samsung_galaxy_s0 perfectly .
0	the only issue i have with the case is i use an aux cable regularly in my car to play music through the stereo and you have to push the cable quite firm to fit past the silicone casing .
0	other than that delivery time was great and i '_m happy i spent the money on a decent good quality case
0	i have used quite a few cd_key websites and without a shadow of a doubt simplycdkeys is the best out there by far !
0	my pre_- order was delivered the day before release so that i could preload the game which is perfect for my under par internet_connection .
0	other orders i have placed also arrived around 0 minutes after making payment at the checkout .
0	if you have any sense at all then you will shop with simplycdkeys and never buy your games from anywhere_else again .
0	do not use this website .
0	they have taken a lot of peoples money and do not send you any keys .
0	they never reply to any support chat or support emails .
0	they are a fraud and are stealing peoples money .
0	stay_away !!!!!!!!!!
0	!
0	i was very surprised at how fast and simple ordering from go0arena was .
0	the delivery was so fast .
0	i received the cd_key within 0 minutes of placing my order !
0	always a good price and rapid delivery service .
0	great selection of gear and at a good price , annoyingly i '_ve experienced issues when trying ( and paying ) for next_day service , they havent sent the goods out and havent let_me know why until i have hassled them .
0	overall they are ok and i still use them , just not for critical stuff any more .
0	fantastic service , they really know their stuff helped_me get the right replacement parts for my v0 vantage at a reasonable price .
0	would definitely use them again .

0	i recently_purchased the simcity 0000 serial_number online .
0	i had never bought a game online like this before and was unsure if it was a good idea , i thought maybe i should just go into_town and buy it from a shop like the good old days .
0	my friend recommended cjs to me via a link on facebook .
0	he told me that he buys all his games direct from cjs as they process orders automatically and you get your serial_number straight_away unlike_other_sites that can leave you waiting days sometimes even weeks to reply with a working serial_number .
0	i paid via_paypal and was instantly able to view my new simcity serial_number , i entered the code in the origin console under the ' redeem product ' tab and began downloading the full version of the game ...
0	happy days !
0	:)
0	i would recommend cjs to any gamer that does not want to pay full price for a game !
0	why pay full price when you can go to cjs !
0	we chose nortlander in the first place out of all of the other travel companies because of how cheap the package was .
0	also because they were literally the only company to focus on what they could give us rather_than what all the other_companies couldn_'_t do for us i . e .
0	they didn_'_t bitch about the other_companies and just gave_us the best deal they could .
0	throughout the semester they helped_us with anything we needed promotion - wise .
0	emails were replied to almost every time with speed .
0	when we had to expand the trip from 000 to 000 due to massive sign up numbers , they allowed_us to do so within 0 days of finding out we needed more spaces which took a huge_amount of pressure off us as a committee ( a lot of people were very annoyed that they werent in the first 000 ).
0	during the trip , all of the reps were well liked by everyone .
0	noise complaints and situations were handled well .
0	all events in resort were run as planned and relatively on - time .
0	overall , from my own experience and from speaking to anyone on the trip , nortlander helped make this the best trip to date for dcu snowsports .
0	have been speaking to ' rowan ' for an eta on my delivery .
0	have been advised it would be delivered 00 / 00 / 00 between_0am - 0pm .
0	hopefully this will happen and i will have a happy birthday_girl on saturday : )
0	thanks again rowan .. excellent service
0	having moved over to shopto after game '_s demise i '_ve been impressed , the prices have been the cheapest and the service is excellent
0	ordered 0no .
0	0 phase mcb '_s from the website , received the confirmation_email and the money left my account all £_000 of it .
0	i went to the website to chase up the order and find out that they have ceased_trading .
0	thanks for ripping me off !!!!
0	!
0	my delivery came as expected in a special insulated box with ice_packs .
0	we '_ve only had two of the steaks so_far but i '_m very impressed with the quality , we '_ll be ordering meat again from westin_gourmet .
0	highly_recommend
0	my order came quickly and i am very pleased with my watch , the glow from it at night is the deciding_factor that made my mind up to buy it and it doesn_'_t dissapoint .
0	highly_recommend the company and it '_s watches
0	i was with 0 for a couple of years and at first seemed ok although the coverage wasn_'_t that great and i was supposed to receive a 0g_signal everywhere around me but i didn_'_t .
0	the worst thing about them was the endless calls from 0 trying to sell me another phone or contract , they would go through periods of ringing me four times a day for a week until i answered it !!
0	!
0	even when i answered it and said i don_'_t want another phone they would carry on saying i could give it to a family_member or friend .... why the hell would i want to pay for someone_elses phone !
0	when i cancelled my contract the person was trying to sell me another one .... rediculous .
0	i '_ve_used mazuma countless_times and the service is always faultless and fast .
0	this is the fastest , most accurate and most useful search_engine out there .
0	don_'_t bother with others , you ' re just wasting time .
0	never had any_problems with amazon .
0	items arrive on time 00 . 0 % of the time , the one time i did have to return an item ( which wasn_'_t to do with amazon ) i simply e_- mailed them and they sent me the paperwork necessary to send it back and i got a full_refund .
0	amazon is the first_port of call whenever i need ... well , anything .
0	as it was my first order , they informed me that my item was going to be delivered to my billing_address rather then my shipping address .
0	i explained that i was a student and would like it to be shipped here ( shipping address ) and david wood contacted me personally and simply asked me to email from my university email and he would make_sure it was sent here .
0	very helpful .
0	this is all i can rate the company on as i haven_'_t received the order yet but very good customer service .
0	i would definitely recommend and reuse dolphinmusic .
0	the album looks fantastic , it looks and feels similar to the price , quality paper .
0	in all a very good product worth the money
0	great value product delivered next_day delivery which was a lovely suprise .
0	exactly as_described and works_brilliantly .
0	very good company !
0	!
0	been using as for 0 years_now wouldnt go_anywhere_else and i dont have to check prices elsewhere as their price match guarantees me the cheapest price and fast free delivery .
0	from my initial_contact with away0 , through to a successful booking , daniel mednick '_s delivery and approach has_been friendly , committed and diligent .
0	early on in the process daniel was very understanding and we discussed in depth budget , location and duration .
0	soon after , daniel matched me to a perfect and ideal holiday , he looked after me with great care and offered plenty of guidance on how i could save_money .
0	we opted for the ncl epic cruise with two nights at the 0 **** new hotel of marselle prior to cruising .
0	alas , i was very cheeky and took away all his details and found the deal for myself , but daniel come_back again and not only beat my quote but still worked out an excellent deal which also included extras .
0	this to me really showed he was looking after the customer .
0	daniel '_s advice continued throughout with tips and recommendations , which i found very practicable , encouraging and ultimately very beneficial .
0	i have really appreciated daniel and away0 '_s support ; the outcome of which is that we have now booked a great holiday , at a superb rate which we are very excited_about !
0	thanks daniel , next year i am booking my honeymoon ....
0	i know who to call .
0	i left a 0_star_review for nigel_o ' hara after my awful experience shopping ( if that '_s what i can call it ) with them .
0	it was taken down within hours by the company for no proof of purchase .
0	i have noticed that there are now several reviews that have been taken down for the same reason , funnily_enough , none of the fake 0_star reviews have been taken down .
0	i replied to you the next_day with a pdf of my order confirmation and a week and a bit later my review is still not live and i have heard_nothing from you .
0	i have also contacted your support email address about a rather concerning matter regarding fake_reviews being added to your site for this company because nigel_o ' hara were running competitions on their facebook_page whereby the only way to enter was to leave a positive review on your site .
0	i am not sure this practise is even legal !?
0	but once again , i have heard_nothing from you .
0	what else am i supposed to do to get in contact with you ?
0	very disappointed in the customer service i have received from yourselves !
0	i ordered a watch for my wife '_s birthday .
0	it stated on their website , delivery within 0 - 0 days which wasn_'_t a problem .
0	however , i didn_'_t expect 0 months later to still not have received my item .
0	i had to contact them on a weekly_basis as they never contacted me bar 0 phone_calls basically telling_me that they were still_waiting for the item from their supplier .
0	every week i had the same message back " we apologise for the delay , we expect the item to be with you by next week ".
0	that happened for just over two and a half months !!
0	what shocked me the most is that i arranged them to contact me regarding my order about a month and a half after_placing it and he just repeated what was in the emails they were sending .
0	i asked what was causing the delay and they told me that they couldn_'_t tell me , i then asked if they had been in contact with the supplier and the gentleman '_s response was " no , we don_'_t normally do that with slight delays ".
0	so not only had they given me the same copy and paste response each week , they hadn_'_t even chased the item with the supplier and had the audacity to say that a month and a half was a slight_delay .
0	they offered me , actually , no they didn_'_t ... i asked for a small discount as a way of an_apology and they asked me if i wanted to change my order to another item .
0	due to the massive two and a half month wait and the disgusting customer service , i decided to change my order to a different watch .
0	low and behold , they didn_'_t have this one in stock either , i waited a couple of weeks and had no contact from nigel_o ' hara , not even an email to let_me know they had placed a new order for me .
0	by this point , i had had enough and cancelled my order .
0	during this entire time , they were still accepting orders on the watch i ordered which is what i find most disturbing .
0	how can a company take orders for an item they evidentially don_'_t have and obviously have no way of obtaining .
0	even as i write this now , they are still taking orders on the watch and it '_s still out of stock !
0	how many other people must be going through the same thing as me ?
0	so to round off , this is the worse shopping_experience i have ever had !
0	i can '_t express how bad the customer service was with just the same generic email being sent to me each week and not telling_me anything .
0	i asked them several_times if they didn_'_t think they were going to get the item in stock to let_me know so i could cancel the order and order elsewhere , but each week they promised me it would be with me the following week .
0	a terrible_terrible company and i would stay as far away from them as possible !
0	just to add , it '_s been 0_weeks since them promising my refund within 00_hours and i have still not received it even after_contacting them .
0	got a the muscle warfare stack and some other itwms for almost_half of what other_sites were selling for .
0	oh and free supps !!!!
0	!
0	ordered the wrong_size but shoetique manage to switch size for a day with good service .
0	will order more in future
0	i ordered a lens and lens filter from pixmania . ie and received them both in very good packaging 0 days_later even_though they had come all the way from belgium to ireland .
0	couldn_'_t be any happier with the speed , efficiency & professionalism of delivery !
0	placing my order was very simple & straight_forward .
0	payment was just as easy and it '_s an added_bonus that i could pay with paypal unlike amazon .
0	the price for the lens i got was also the cheapest i could_find so overall i couldn_'_t have been any happier with how the whole_process went .
0	i will_definitely be using pixmania again !
0	couldn_'_t fault the company at all .
0	simple as that .
0	third time i have used mazuma and again it was great all_round .
0	very good pricing .
0	gave_me an additional discount for a bulk buy
0	even_tho their prices and the cheapest on the net .
0	quick delivery to southern_ireland which is hard to come by .
0	have bought from them before and will buy again .
0	as above , my item came from germany by ups .
0	arrived on time , job_done , great price - highly_recommended .
0	bought tickets , was contacted and confirmed via_email .
0	received ticket within plenty of time of show .
0	would recommend to anyone .
0	kyle maguire
0	i found many cheap codes for all the games i like , i would recommend for anyone using digital_downloads and the rate of delivery was super_fast i also found the site rather easy to navigate .
0	when i was first recommended cjs_cd_keys by a colleague , i was highly suspicious of the site being a possible scam .
0	fortunately after_reading quite a lot of reviews on trustpilot , i decided to take the plunge and purchased a bf0_premium cd_key .
0	their autokey distribution system is very easy to use once your purchase has_been paid for .
0	the key i was sent activated straight_away on origin and i was getting stuck into to the cq expansion within minutes and enjoying every second of it !
0	real happy with my purchase !
0	would not_hesitate to buy from again !
0	ordered a edimax apn from them , which arrived promptly - though the courier delivered it quite late at around 0pm - kudo '_s to him for not turning around to head for home and leaving it for the next_day .
0	ive purchased from kikatek on quite a few occasions already , but the other day was the first time ive actually had to contact them after a possible bodged firmware_update for the apn i ordered .
0	their support was very professional and were more then willing to help .
0	fortunately i had also contacted edimax before emailing kikatek support and had everything sorted_out so i didnt require an rma .
0	so it was a bit of a false alarm .
0	when these_guys say ' next_day ' delivery - they arent kidding !
0	!
0	i opted for the cheaper rm 0st_class delivery option ( 0 - 0days ) but i recieved an email later in the day telling_me my order had been dispatched and would arrive the very next_day .
0	this is my first experience with quietpc and it has a been a very satisfactory one based on their delivery speed and the condition my order arrived in .
0	i will_definitely do more business with them in the future !
0	!
0	excellent prices , and super_fast service .
0	i will always recommend igful to my friends .
0	bravo !!!!
0	!
0	support , support
0	excellent company fast cheap delivery and when i needed to return an item this was dealt_with very efficiently .

0	they have great deals , the customer service i receive everytime is second to none .
0	i love the whey_protein chocolate powder just goes down so nice everytime and also i have seen very good gains from it .
0	don_'_t get me wrong i do train very hard and also eat good balanced meals !
0	!
0	use powerbeck they won_'_t let you down !
0	!
0	my order was not processsed for a week , when i queried this the customer suport rep told me " oh i will need to check with the warehouse , i don_'_t think they got the email "
0	when the order was eventually dispatched it was incomplete , no one informed me that i would not receive two items .
0	shoddy website , shoddy service , i will never use them again .
0	mazuma could not be more highly_recommended by myself ; i completed the required details and had my pack sent to me , which actually arrived the next_day .
0	i posted my phone at 0pm and received an email from mazuma at 00 :_00am the next_day saying payment would be made shortly ...
0	i had my money by 00pm , less_than 00_hours from time of postage !
0	brilliant !
0	ordered my item on the thursday before 0pm and it arrived on the friday , excellent speedy delivery cant_complain_about that .
0	well informed_throughout the buying and delivery process with emails_telling you exactly_what '_s happening and where your product is .

0	thy are just a fraud company .
0	be - careful .
0	don_'_t trust them .
0	they will take your money and will not answer you .
0	fantastic experience with funktion .
0	we weren_'_t sure what to do for my friends stag_do but the funktion team had loads of ideas and contacts for us to use .
0	jay gave_us a great quote and fantastic service .
0	nothing was to much_trouble .

0	guy called anwar at rgb deserves special credit .
0	nice_bloke , very helpful and polite .
0	many_thanks .
0	having heard many bad_reviews on various_sites about the different mobile recycle companies i was dubious to try it , but i find putting stuff on ebay a hassle now days so didn_'_t want to do that .
0	i decided to give mazuma a chance .
0	i was quoted from the website £_00 .
0	i posted my phones off .
0	a day later i had an email_saying the phones had been recevied and a cheque posted out .
0	the very next_day a cheque for £_00 arrives through the door .
0	i was absolutely amazed .
0	i got a fair price for the phones and the payment within 0 days of posting my phones off .
0	i will_definitely use mazuma_mobile next time to recycle a phone .
0	thanks mazuma
0	maravilha !

0	i '_m booking my ferries with aferry on a regular base .
0	they ' re easy to use and give me the option to compare prices before booking .
0	will use them again and again and again .
0	a +
0	da ich beruflich häufiger auf die fähre von und nach england angewiesen bin und mir die ökonomischste verbindung wichtig ist , habe_ich im vergangenen jahr viel zeit damit verbracht den besten anbieter zu finden - bis ich auf aferry gestoßen bin und mein suchen endlich ein ende hatte .
0	seither buche ich nur noch mit ihnen .
0	warum ?
0	die buchung geht schnell , das system ist einfach zu durchschauen und bietet mir stets die günstigste verbindung an .
0	auch abänderungen können leicht vorgenommen werden .
0	daher : fünft sterne und ein gerne widerkehrender kunde .
0	great prices , genuine products , super - fast delivery ( uk -> greece ), discount_coupons shipped along my purchase , highly_recommended .
0	the level of customer service received from first point of contact all the way through to receipt , replacement and currently sorting_out technical_issues has_been first_rate with everyone i have dealt_with .
0	very happy to recommend hifi_gear to anyone who will listen !
0	very easy to use and highly reliable website .
0	the website does not show the true condition of the watch ; i order an omega_constellation from watch finders , it was far from the 00 / 00 quality they promised .
0	they issued me a refund a week_later with a cheque that took another week to clear and to make it up they said we will offer you free_postage when you order again !
0	i ordered another watch , it was small in size ; obviously links were missing - they did not charge me for postage initially , but when returned for refund , they charged me for postage !
0	un fair , miss - informed and above all xxx !
0	you cannot charge for something when you have agreed initially that its for free !
0	they said they will send a cheque to make up for the postage cost - its been months now and i don_'_t think i should expect anything !
0	the website has anything / everything you could ever want and need while providing great prices and fantastic shipping .
0	all of my orders i recieved in a few_days at most .
0	also all thefantastic freebies that im able to try before i buy helps me pick products i like .
0	a good network but very slow to connect when you lose and gain signal , also very expensive when you go abroad and make calls and use internet ( more than any network i have been with before ).
0	ordered for the first time a few_months_ago from my local_store ( torquay ), and the driver forgot to bring up half of my shopping to the door , and just drove_off !
0	needless to say that a few items were badly_damaged and dates were terrible ... so i rang up my local_store and one of the girls were extremely rude , i ordered to speak to the store manager and he ordered the forgot shopping back to my house and also gave_me a full_refund .
0	so a few_months later ( last_week ) i decided to give them another try , the delivery came yesterday and once again 0 items were severely_damaged , including cracked eggs and squashed pastries .
0	the mere fact that they also give you reduced items is rediculous as well , dates were also terrible and required me to eat everything within 0 - 0 days lol !
0	so i rang customer service , the man was very helpful , and refunded me half my shop .
0	this shouldn_'_t be happening , regardless of the refunds given , they are ruining their brilliant reputation they have instore .
0	i normally cannot_afford to shop_here and usually shop at asda or sburys , but i like to try waitrose food now and again so i '_m willing to spend the money .
0	each of the times i have changed to ordering from waitrose , it '_s been a dreadful experience .
0	so stay clear , the previous reviews don_'_t lie as well .
0	nice selection of latest clothes , good delivery time , and also they have a decent sale on almost constantly .
0	best online shop for contemperary clothing .
0	ordered a dozen_times and never any_problems .
0	ordered a few fragrances from this comany , and the prices are best you are going to find in the uk .
0	shipping takes around 0 - 0 days , but is free so i guess it isn_'_t that bad !
0	packaging is also top_notch ..
0	great service , great prices , would highly_recommend !
0	i don_'_t use courier companies outside work but i had to send a package back to a retailer .
0	i sent it from london , it was picked_up from my house and went to birmingham .
0	i booked this in on thursday_morning and this was picked_up and delivered by friday .
0	it was not that expensive and i was shocked at the service .
0	i can '_t recommend highly_enough .
0	i ordered waited 0 hour 00_mins .
0	then phoned the pizza shop direct they said they had no record despite a confirmation e_- mail .
0	i would suggest that you try deliverance . co . uk much more reliable .
0	great weekend handled well by chillisauce , didn_'_t have any worries ... and the hotel was much too fancy for a bunch of hairy ars * d men on a stag_do !
0	total_scam !!!
0	did not deliver my flowers for mothers_day .
0	when i emailed to complain they sent me one email_saying they thought they had been delivered and then they ignored every subsequest email .
0	in the end i had to request a chargeback from my credit_card company to get my money back .
0	do not use them you will be disappointed and out of pocket !!!!!!!!!!!!
0	!
0	... this be a great website !
0	love the layout , searching for products is easy and love the support they give .
0	even on the rare_occasion where we '_ve had to chase something up or we '_ve had a problem with an item they '_ve been quick to rectify and offer a fast and friendly service .
0	i have used thedrinkshop . com for quite a few_years and not only have i found their large_selection of alcohol at competitive_pricing , but their service delivery is top_notch too !
0	with fast dispatch in quality packaging , i really can '_t fault them .
0	the best dedicated online games shop on the web - great games , great prices , speedy dispatch , texts / emails / picture updates to let_me know that my order has_been processed , packed & sent .
0	if you want pre_- ordered games to arrive on time or even ahead of schedule then shopto is the place to go !
0	i have been exploring many websites that deal with mobile_recycling but i was recommended mazuma by a few friends saying how quick and easy it was as well as great value for money so i thought_id take a gamble .
0	i have to say this is probably one of the most efficient and outstanding websites i have come_across .
0	not only was it easy to place an order , but the efficiency from when i sent the phones to you to when i received confirmation that the money was transferred to my account was astonishing !
0	literally about 00_hours it took .
0	the money i received will now be going towards a few special presents as its my mums_00th coming up as well as my son oscars first birthday coming up .
0	thank_you to all the staff who work for mazuma , you are all a credit to yourselves and i will be recommending your site to everybody !
0	!
0	we have ordered from printer land on a number of occasions and have always received truly excellent service from_start to finish .
0	i cannot rate them highly_enough .
0	their advice on products is accurate and fair , and the efficiency of the ordering_process could not be better !
0	i can definatly recommend this site to anyone looking to cash in on an old laptop .
0	i came_accross many sites and this one offered me the best price , i was a little_wary at first but there was no need .
0	i got an email_saying my laptop had been recieved the following_day after_posting and a quote a few_days_later .
0	my quote after inspection was £_00 lower_than my orignal but for a valid_reason and the price was still more than i expected .
0	after accepting the re - vised quote i had the money in my payal account in no time !

0	i took out a phone contract via carphone_warehouse , when i received the phone i was told i could cancel the phone insurance , which i did .
0	0 months later i check my bank_account ... 0 transactions showed up , each from the carphone_warehouse .
0	i called them to ask for a refund .
0	0st agent told me i never cancelled it ( despite me having received a confirmation letter confirming my cancellation )
0	0nd agent was more helpful , he apologises for the mix_up , and offers to refund the money .
0	whilst im on the phone he told me the refund is sent , will take_upto 0 days .
0	checked my bank_account 0 days_later no refund !
0	lying robbing scum !
0	so , i had 0 tyres_fitted to my 0x0 , the remaining 0 tyres were to be balanced - although the driver quite rudely disputed this at first until he re - read his work sheet and decided that i was right .
0	the two new tyres were inflated to 00psi , 00psi more than the car manufactures recommendation .
0	i didnt find this out until a week_later as at the time i asked if he needed to see the handbook for the correct pressures he said " no " and that he knew what they should be .
0	a classic case of putting your ego first i think !
0	theres no shame in not memorising recommended tyre_pressures for every car in the world right ...?
0	a few_months later i order 0 more tyres as the fronts now need doing .
0	on some 0x0s you need to match brands front and rear so that the central viscous differential is balanced , particularly at high speeds .
0	the tyres have since dissapeared from the grippy website !
0	so i phone them up and enquire .
0	im told that the tyres are now available but they forgot to make them appear on the site !
0	back i go to the site and now book 0 more tyres to match the ones previously fitted on the vehicle .
0	done !
0	that is until i get a phone_call saying that they cant now get hold of the tyres .
0	so they do have the tyres , then they dont have the tyres , then they do have them again , then actually they dont have them !
0	so ive already booked and paid for these tyres which dont exist .
0	im offered an_alternative and assured they will be a suitable match to the new tyres purchased previously .
0	only problem is they dont seem to know what it is they are giving me .
0	" its either one of these or one of those " im told - being two different rated tyres .
0	as they dont_know what they are giving me they at_least have the decency to charge me only for the cheapest of the two alternatives .
0	on the day of fitting i arrange to leave work early to arrive home for the 0pm to 0pm fitting window .
0	at 0 . 00 im phoned and told the driver is over 0 hours away , driving from dover ( to hampshire ) and that actually they are going to cancel my fitting !
0	ok i think , come around first thing in the morn and that will be fine , we cant help bad traffic can we ...
0	im then told my fitting cannot be done tomorrow and the next available slot is on saturday , 0 days_later !
0	this is just plainly poor customer focus in the business .
0	if something_goes_wrong you sort it as soon as possible .
0	you dont put customers back to the end of the queue because you failed to deliver first time around .
0	i need these new tyres on now so i can put some motorway miles on the car without_damaging the vcu ( differential ).
0	im told by grippy that there is " nothing that they can do " which is the most useless , bailout of a phrase .
0	of course there is something you can do , but you are chosing the option that is most simple for your business .
0	if you are in the supermarket and the till breaks , once they fix it they dont send you to the back of the queue , you serve them as soon as possible .
0	i cancelled my order and requested a refund which apparently takes 0 days !
0	i then thought about it and if the driver was 0 hours late , for a 0 hour journey , he must have left his last job halfway into my time_slot .
0	traffic or not he was never going to get to me on time .
0	be warned it seems grippy are over inflating themselves and booking more slots than time in the day !
0	read the other reviews on this site and it seems im not alone .
0	before you buy from grippy ask yourself the question " once ive bought these tyres and arranged time off work - will i mind when they dont turn_up and offer me a slot 0 days_later so i can do it all again ?".
0	then go to your local tyre shop .
0	im going to have to do what i should have all along , drive to a local tyre shop , pay a few_quid more than grippy for the tyres that i want , fitted in front of my eyes , done !
0	rude mechanics who dont_know their stuff , a flaky supply_chain where stock is checked after an order has_been placed and paid for , staff and business policy that have a " cant do " attitude .
0	surprised ?
0	well you get what you pay for dont you ?
0	supplement_warehouse is a great escape from the overpriced stores that offer the same product .
0	it is very obvious the supplement_warehouse strives to offer you the best price for supreme products because of the amazing feature they have which is comparing a competitor '_s price and if a competitor '_s price is lower , supplement_warehouse will automatically make it less_than that lowest_price .
0	i am an extremely satisfied customer .
0	i highly_recommend this website / service to any individual who plans to delve into purchasing supplements .
0	traded in a couple of idevices with no_problems at all .
0	recieved a decent amount by cheque .
0	communication was excellent throughout .
0	will_certainly use again .
0	i rang customer_services at 00 : 00 on 00 / 00 / 00
0	i had miss placed all my phon numbers and had no way of getting them back i needed one contact asap and i spoke to a guy called michael he was a star !
0	he found it no problem at all and has made my day .
0	it helps me save_money on my supplement_needs :)
0	the price is very competitive , however , when i arrived in cancun , there was no driver with a large sign waiting .
0	i spent about 00_mins looking for the right person and it turned_out they had been wandering_around not by the arrivals exit and they only had an a0 clipboard which had multiple other logos on too , so was not easily_identifiable .
0	then had to wait about 00_mins for the van .
0	another comment : the website is confusing to use if you want to book one way transfers out of resort as the boxes refer to inbound flights and the wording swaps around between pages - maybe look into it .
0	overall i was pleased with the service for the price though and my return transfer ran perfectly .
0	great company when things are going well however my flowers were delivered 0 days late .
0	i have received no useful responses from the customer service team after i notified them ( not the other way around !)
0	and they have taken 0 days to reply to my most_recent email .
0	they promised to redeliver immediately and even the replacement flowers were later than promised .
0	i can '_t understand_why i have received such little communication ( each time from a different person_who doesn_'_t answer the points raised in my message ) when surely the worst error a flower delivery company can make is delivering flowers nearly a week late ?
0	yes they are cheap , but you get what you pay for !
0	last weekend in budapest was fantastic thanks to the guys at chillisauce !
0	from_start to finish everything was well_organised , involved brilliant activities , was great value and saved us heaps of time .
0	i '_ve actually been on a chillisauce do before , but thought it was all down to the hard work of our mate .
0	now i know better .
0	would i use chillisauce again ?
0	it '_s a no_brainer - yes .
0	i '_ve never had any_problems with magic_madhouse and i '_ve ordered from them > 0 times now , the cards come within 0 days and the cards arrive in an immaculate_condition .
0	i can '_t think of any_problems i '_ve had with them and their loyalty service is second to none .
0	i '_ve been using this website for around a month now and i can '_t say anything wrong with it , they have good prices and a good collection of games , this paired with a quick delivery system for the cd_keys is just fantastic
0	i '_ve bought two guitars from richtone , and the service has_been great both_times .
0	both arrived exactly when they should have ( which was next_day delivery ), and the two guitars were set_up beautifully .
0	not sure what more you can ask for really !
0	this was a great company they were very quick ( almost scarey ) but never the less pleased with the end_result
0	thank_you for your great service and knowledge when i made my purchase .
0	deciding on the correct high - end watch was not an easy decision , but the knowledge and information i received was fantastic .
0	it is our second family purchase from xupes . com and i am sure there will be many more to come .
0	wish i went to mazuma first !
0	tryed somewhere_else and had a nightmare .
0	will_defiantly use first time next tune .
0	right product , right price , fast delivery
0	great service .
0	helpful on the phone and quick delivery .
0	i decided to use mazumamobile based on the great reputation they have for customer service and i wasn_'_t dissapointed !
0	the website was very easy to use and only to a couple of minutes to place an order to send three phones .
0	the price quoted was up there with the other_websites too .
0	the pack to send the phones in arrived the next_day and again was easy to use with the forms to submit already completed .
0	free p_&_p too .
0	i went for the option of a cheque and this arrived two_days_later , even in all the postal delays due to the snow .
0	now i know the system works i ' d probably use the bank_transfer next time .
0	they emailed confirmation of every_step and you can follow the order online too .
0	00 out of 00 for sure , a really positive_experience .
0	great way to turn drawer clutter into cash .
0	much like others experiences , i sent an iphone_0s and it was reduced due to supposed water_damage .
0	the phone was in perfect working condition .
0	something seems to have changed about this company .
0	i definitely will not use them again .
0	it does not take 0 working_days to do a bank_transfer .
0	it doesn_'_t take that long to banka cheque !
0	the maximum it should be is 0 days .
0	outstanding service , cheap , on time , and very professional .
0	very polite and professional fitter frazer .
0	will_definately_use again thanks !
0	!
0	got to say when my phone went wrong orange couldnt have been better
0	dealt_with easily on the phone and arranged for replacemnt next_day which happened !
0	!
0	new phone in hand and very pleased
0	thanks
0	the product was exactly as_described , very reasonable and free delivery was even better .
0	the service when i phoned up could not have been better .
0	i was told about the difference in chairs and also what was the best size table for my decking and rattan warehouse were correct in all_aspects .
0	just all put out and i have to say what a lovely set of furniture it looks , the cushions are sooo nice as well ..., not those cheap thin ones i have seen on some sets i have viewed .
0	a really good website with a back up and sales_team who really know their stuff .... and the delivery driver was also friendly and couldnt do enough to put furniture in the garden , and my garden is 000ft long and the decking is at the back !
0	!
0	just a really good website and great ' real_person ' experience !
0	!”
0	ordered a ps0_game for £_00 , arrived very quickly and well_packaged but somehow the case for the game had got smashed ( i '_m blaming royal_mail ) i sent a email to customer service and got a reply back only 00_mins later saying they would send out a replacement case .
0	the case arrived the very next_day in perfect_condition .
0	top service , top prices , i strongly_recommend !
0	been using viovet for some time now as my pet_needs medication on a fairly regular_basis .
0	viovet always get the medication to my door in super_fast time and i '_ve never had any_problems .
0	if you are looking for a reliable place to get medication from , or anything pet_related for that matter , viovet are really good .
0	tecc offers the best quality of products in the market at the best prices with great deals throughout the year .
0	tecc should be everyones first stop when considering replacement products to smoking .
0	amazing prices with fast delivery !
0	i have ordered several bouquets from this company .
0	mainly for my mum but also to other family_members .
0	i have never ever had any_issues with them .
0	the bouquets are always beautiful looking and last ages .
0	i ordered a rose and lily bouquet for my mum and it lasted over 0_weeks .
0	she had been given some flowers from the supermarket at the same time but they died within a week !
0	!
0	customer service is always really helpful and i would recommend prestige to anyone .
0	i will never order flowers from anyone_else but prestige_flowers
0	excellent service , great prices , even better staff .
0	you will feel at home and well taken_care of at official_watches / dd jewellers .
0	brilliant website , fantastic staff to follow_up the easy to use website .
0	would highly_recommend using this website !
0	microsoft are the leaders when it comes to software in my opinion but they rarely listen to their customers on what they would like to see or need in a program upgrade .
0	they are a very american company in the way they run and this does not always fit well with how businesses should be in the united_kingdom .
0	they like to have their own piece of everything and if someone does something better then they just try and kill off competition with buying companies out or buying exclusive content / hardware for themselves .
0	customer_support is not very good at all either , usually stuck on the phone with an indian_call_centre for hours when it should have been done it 00 to 00_minutes .
0	i wouldnt use anywhere_else to find info about a movie than here , it has it all .
0	the review system could use a bit of work as films are always rated loads of 0s and 00s to try and balance the scores out but if people would just rate them properly then it would be so much_better .
0	id still give it a 0 out of 0_stars though as everything else just works so well .
0	seeing amazon grow over the years has_been great to see the expansion in available items and its great to go to one place for many different_types of goods .
0	the problem with amazon is that when you have faulty goods or problems they arent always very helpful .
0	i had a hardware fault which was an inherent manufacturer defect but amazon said i had no rights to claim a repair or replacement from them ( they say the sale of goods_act is a load of rubbish ) i had to go through the courts in the end to get them to deal with my faulty goods .
0	also bad if you have to return damaged goods , its at your own_expense and in most_cases they dont even pay back the cost of your postage_charges of recorded delivery so the item is traceable in the mail .
0	not a good way for a company to work .
0	when things go right with paypal its pretty good , as soon as it goes_wrong though you find that all paypals promises are just lies and loads of extra terms kick in to protect them and make them even more money but give you no protection at all .
0	wouldnt touch these with a barge_pole unless it is the only way you could pay for an item , id recommend using a credit_card though so you can do a chargeback if you get ripped_off from a seller of an item .
0	google is by far the best web search_engine around , nobody does things half as good as these .
0	also i am very happy with the way google android is coming along with each release it is getting better , cant_wait_till they are up there giving microsoft a run for their money in the home os markets .
0	shopto are in my opinion the place to go for your games , cheapest prices in most_cases , a great reward_system in giving you points that equate to cash to use for future_purchases but best of all the superb fast delivery times .
0	i have ordered items as late as 0pm and received them the day after , never had a late item delivery , in most_cases i have had games a day or 0 before release_date .
0	couldnt praise them more and cant really ask for more from a company .
0	i was astonished by the speed of service .
0	i ordered twice , and both_times the products arrived the next_day , which is remarkable given the small postage charge .
0	saved 00_% over the next cheapest alternative - all_round excellent service .
0	i have used eframe twice_now and have been very impressed with the speed of the service ( considering the frames are custom made ) and the quality of the product .
0	i will_definitely use them again .
0	pc game supply satisfied my need for psn us prepaid cards in the uk .
0	the prices were fair ( even a few_pennies below the day '_s currency trading rate ).
0	i ordered wedding thank_you cards from bride and groom_direct and even when a shipping mix_up happened on my end , bride and groom_direct were very quick in trying to help me locate my order .
0	great service from a great company .
0	i bought a shirt as a gift last christmas and the service i received from the staff at uk soccer shop was excellent .
0	their email support is very good .
0	i will buy from them again and i would recommend others to do so as well .
0	professional landlord : 0_weeks and still_waiting for the money .
0	also they do not reply to our mails .
0	very bad .
0	we are refusing all bookings from wimdu now !
0	sender put wrong_address then he told them right address . p0g then didn_'_t in form city_link about changes of address their forth my son missed his main birthday_present . item sent out on the 0 / 0 / 00 and still not got it by today which is 00 / 000 crap service don_'_t use them ........................
0	i have order several_times through fragrance_direct and every time the products have been of an excellent quality which are delivered promptly .
0	in addition to this the price is the best around always a good few_pounds_cheaper_than competitors .
0	highly , highly_recommended !
0	i ordered 0x0gb_ram for my 0000 imac .
0	the memory arrived promptly and was package excellently with clear_instructions for fitting .
0	my computer now runs at an unbelieveable speed !
0	thank_you !
0	i have used ccl on a few occasions before .
0	they always have stock of the product that i am looking for , they are always competitive on price and deliveries and both speedy and efficient .
0	ordering the products was simple , all of the information i needed was to hand .
0	throughout the delivery period i was kept_informed on the whereabouts of my order and my products arrived as and when advised .
0	have been using holbi / datalink for about 0 - 0 years_now , they have the capability to implement an endless amount of features and integrations .
0	currently they integrate with ebay and amazon for me , with automatic listing and stock sync , and import directly to sage including multi currency and multi platform / vat options .
0	their customer service is always very prompt and helpful .
0	would recommend without_any problem .

0	i ordered some filters last_week thursday and they arrived on monday_morning .
0	i needed some more knowledge on nd filters which cameraking were willing to point me in the right_direction for .
0	i think they offer a good service despite what other reviews state below ( it seems many of the reviews have ben posted a long time ago )
0	shopping on line is easy once you '_ve done your first order .
0	delivery was on time and correct with suitable replacements where necessary .
0	company called after delivery to check all was well .
0	received good offers and discount_vouchers for next time .
0	much_easier than trudging through the isles .
0	just need someone to put it all away now !

0	payment_method was quick and delivery free and very quick .
0	order number_000000000
0	i find amazon have an excellent variety and range of products plus prices are generally cheap .
0	their reviews also help and it '_s easy to control ones orders on the site .
0	besides this i am also a kindle fan so i find the ebook purchasing process really easy to do plus the ebooks are automatically uploaded to my kindle which is cool .
0	i find shopperhive '_s comparison listings easy to compare , especially using the grid view .
0	they have a wide_selection of online shops including niche boutique retailers which i don_'_t really find on other comparison_websites .
0	all information seems up to date when clicking_through to various retailer websites to make my purchases and i also find that there is a lot of useful_information on the product page to help me with my purchase decision .
0	in particular i like the price history info on a product because this shows me that i can set_up a realistic price alert for that product and save when it reaches my target price .
0	i will_definitely be using shopperhive again .
0	i bought rayman legend as i saw it for the cheapest price than anyone_else , fantastic service as i ordered it on the tuesday and got it on the thursday .
0	best site for buying any supplements ... i just search all websites for cheapest place and they match them and give an extra 0 %_off .... alot of the time supplementwarehouse has the cheapest prices too ,, i buy 0 or 0 times a yr from them
0	i ordered two lengths of oak board which arrived on the date i chose with a call from the courier to say how soon they would arrive .

0	definitely shopping here again !
0	thanks guys !
0	i was pretty impressed with this website .
0	their prices seemed to be marginally_cheaper_than their competitors , and they offered free delivery over £_00 which was handy .
0	the delivery was quite fast , although i did have one issue with my order with a couple of items missing from my parcel .
0	i contacted them via_email , and they promptly responded , apologised , and popped my missing items in the post first_class !
0	can '_t complain there !
0	i '_ll probably be using them again in the not - too - distant_future !
0	i contacted jenny for abit of help and sorted it out straight_away , many_thanks again ;-)
0	the site is clear and concise in everything it does .
0	once you '_ve found the product you desire you simply checkout and pay .
0	the security to stop unauthorised users accessing your codes before you do is also a nice_touch .
0	i would recommend this site and its services to everyone .
0	i '_ve been using heartinternet for a while now .
0	i have over 00 domains , i '_ve had a home and business hosting_package and now i use their vps service which is great for all my websites and clients .
0	there has_been a few_times when i '_ve needed quick service to resolve problems and i know i can always rely_on heartinternets amazing customer service to help out .
0	i always recommend them to friends and family .
0	they lost my order , i have wasted time going to the store several_times , only to be told by a member of staff they didn_'_t receive anything - and that they don_'_t know about delivery to stores at all .
0	the online support was not very helpful so_far .
0	i am taking my business elsewhere
0	edit_: - now they lie that i have collected the order .
0	i haven_'_t .
0	worst customer service ever - imagine this was your £_000 photobook .
0	better claim on credit_card straight_away
0	very competitive on pricing and rapid delivery .
0	more than adequately met our needs and would certainly use again in the future .
0	great product , personal customer_services not pushy very professional would use them again

0	the trend with pc games is that they are slowly becoming more_expensive , even_though the medium is now less physical that it used to be due to digital distributors .
0	brand_new games on steam are sometimes going for 00 + quid .
0	as much as i love steam , i love competitive business better and cj '_s offers just that .
0	i picked_up europa universalis iv for 00 quid instead of the steam price tag of 00 . 00 .
0	that is a great saving for what is essentially a newly_released title .
0	the cj '_s service itself was well reviewed , straight_forward and more_importantly legit / secure .
0	so well_done guys , a cracking job and another happy customer , i will be sure to check back for deals often :)

0	i wasn_'_t the organiser of our group but from my point of view everything_went very well and i had a class time , so no_complaints from me .
0	the guides that looked after us were very friendly and knowledgeable .
0	would ceraintly use chillisauce again .
0	the company did not have any stock and only after i contacted them did they respond that that they did not have any idea when i would get the product .
0	very slow to respond .
0	very poor service .
0	would avoid .
0	i bought the new hitman which retailed at £_00 , but i got here at simply_games for £_00 , chuffed at the price already , i was surprised when the game was delivered within 0 business days .
0	definitely going to use this website again , terrific service !
0	so_far the experience has_been great .. the website is very helpful and informative yet convinient and i am fully_satisfied uptill now .
0	i was already perfectly happy with nespresso and their pods , but they simply don_'_t offer enough variety for me .
0	so i was glad to find bclc , who seemed to be well thought of in reviews and came_across professionally from their website .
0	having tried my first few pods now i '_ve got mixed views on them as a long_term viable_alternative to genuine nespresso .
0	obviously the price is good and on top of that my initial opinion is that the blends are high_quality .
0	strangely it seems like the water comes out hotter with these pods than nespresso '_s own , which is a good thing , but i guess i could be imagining that .
0	the down sides are quite considerable and have been mentioned by others , namely the packaging needs a lot of improvement ( i '_m_sure that will come , given they ' re a new brand ) but more worryingly my nespresso_machine '_s pump seems to need to work a lot harder to get the job_done .
0	the lungo pull takes a good while longer_than with regular nespresso_pods , with the coffee coming out at a much slower trickle , and so_far 00_% of the pods i '_ve_used haven_'_t ejected properly , leaving the nespresso_machine flashing its lights in protest !
0	a quick couple of taps on the lungo button resolved the issue , but there certainly isn_'_t full compatibility there yet and i have no idea if this is causing any damage to the machine .
0	so , overall i '_ve been reasonably satisfied with my initial batch '_s flavour , but i '_ll need to live with them a while longer before_deciding to buy again .
0	and by that time nespresso might have launched their new vertuoline machine in the uk , with the redesigned pods , which will be an interesting development for both companies !
0	i had a few games pre_- ordered with gameseek in the build up to the launch of xbox one , most of which i had also pre_- paid for as is gameseek '_s way of doing things .
0	i wasn_'_t too fussed about this as the price was good and the games were due out in 0_weeks , so not too long a wait .
0	however last_week i received an email from them advising me that due to limited stock they would need me to pay in advance for a game called quantum break for xbox one , or my pre_- order would be made available to other customers .
0	now this is a game that currently has no release_date and might not come out for another 00 months or more , so i replied to the email_explaining this and how i was unwilling to pay for a game so_far in advance .
0	i heard_nothing back for a few_days until i checked my account today and found my pre_- order cancelled .
0	so i checked my emails and have had a reply this afternoon that huffily informs_me " not a problem .
0	we '_ve cancelled your order ".
0	it seems to me a ridiculous way to run a company , cancelling genuine pre_- orders from interested customers just because they won_'_t pay for the goods potentially a year in advance .
0	poor .
0	simply_games have always been a reliable online_presence for me and with the big_names failing in their customer service obligations lately ( game '_s delivery time is terrible and amazon have whacked their prices up now that hmv and play are gone ) they ' re well placed to take a lot of my custom .
0	i ordered bioshock_infinite and within a couple of days it had been despatched by first_class post and arrived 0 days before release .
0	would '_ve been with me a couple of days earlier even , but for the atrocious postal service in my area .
0	the icing_on the cake was that the game dropped in price by a few_quid after my copy had been despatched and , without having to be asked , simply_games had reduced my invoice to the new lower price .
0	a great , and hopefully long_lasting , retailer !
0	i ordered a playstation 0 , an extra controller and gta_v , all works great apart_from the extra controllers left analog is a bit loose so it doesn_'_t spring back to the centre - would be nice to have advised that on the page , other than that it works great .
0	all in all great buy , cannot_complain for the price at all , plus the quick delivery .
0	very good .
0	i cant_complain one bit not only did i get an amazing price but i also recieved my codes instantly .
0	payment was quick , simple and fast .
0	the best hostel site .
0	fast delivery and any_problems are sorted very quickly
0	i recently relocated to the us and had to transfer a larger amount .
0	everything worked perfect .
0	thanks a lot !
0	earlier this year our company began contracting out proof reading of marketing to grammar genie as a trial due to the high costs of proof reading and copy editing we were paying to our print management company .
0	the member of staff we dealt_with was sharon .
0	the service from her was very quick and efficient and and attention to detail was unprecedented .
0	we sent off numerous marketing campains to her to be checked , and thought they were grammatically perfect .
0	we were somewhat mistaken to say the least .
0	in 0 days sharon had uncovered dozens of errors , and edited the documents for us giving a list of all the changes she had made .
0	not only that , she changed and reworded many sentences to make everything flow better .
0	sharon has since worked on our company website , legal letters , employment contracts and all our marketing .
0	i cannot reccomend the services of grammar genie enough .
0	very reasonably_priced , and worth every_penny .
0	ordered a piece of furniture in october , which the website said was in stock .
0	called hovells to check the website was correct and was told it was in stock .
0	i ordered it and paid in full .
0	i was then told a few_days_later that it wasnt in stock and would be in in a few_days .
0	a few_days went by and i called again , and was told a few more weeks .
0	this went on for a total of 00 weeks when it finally came into stock .
0	after dozens and dozens of phone_calls to arrange delivery , none of which were actually answered , i gave in and collected it myself from the warehouse .
0	i was then met by a complete jobsworth at the warehouse claiming he doesn_'_t know what to do as the computers are down today .
0	eventually he realised it was actually possible to leave his chair and go and look in the warehouse for my order .
0	throughout the 00 week wait , no one ever contacted me to say there were delays or why , everything was left for me to contact them , which is fine in theory , however they almost never answer the phones , and when they do a clueless member of staff exclaims ' i dont_know , i '_ll find out and ring you back ' which they subsequently never do .
0	if you leave a message on voicemail , no one gets back to you .
0	all in all , they have been the worst company i have ever had the misfortune of dealing_with , and certainly never will again .
0	alright they are cheaper_than most places , but you can see why .
0	its worth_paying a little more to buy the stuff from a retailer who actually has a clue how to run a business .
0	pay_peanuts , you get monkeys !
0	super_fast delivery , i placed my order just after 0pm , it arrived the morning next_day !
0	packaging was also very good ... fantastic service , would definitely recommend
0	have bought from the whisky_exchange several_times now and am always impressed with their selection .
0	recently i bought a bottle of knob creek for my brother on a saturday_evening and it arrived on tuesday ( standard delivery ).
0	very acceptable .
0	bottles ordered arrive well_packaged .
0	i '_m yet to have anything break en_route .
0	would recommend twe to a friend , and in fact it was recommended to me by a friend in the first place .
0	got a tub of retro sweets as a present for a friend '_s four children .
0	hopefully they '_ll love it .
0	one of the review says that the tub was not nearly as full as the picture implies : i would have to disagree .
0	i bought a few extra bits to add to the tub so that there were four of each of the more popular items ( popping candy , for example ) and had difficulty fitting any more in there !
0	tracking_number and communication through email let '_s you know where your product is and when it will arrive which is well decent .
0	the site itself has got really wide_range of clothes , definitely should be able to find the brand you like and it '_s got a mint sale section , well_worth a browse around , you '_ll find something you like easy .
0	super quick deliver and with cash_back deal - the cheapest on the market .
0	avoid argos !!
0	i '_m just about to get married .
0	on 0th of august i ordered two wedding_rings for me and my fiancé in slough branch in observatory shopping centre .
0	i specifically stated i need this rings before 00th of august and wanted to make_sure i will have it delivered to the store on time .
0	the lady said not to worry as the delivery time is never longer_than two_weeks .
0	i placed my order for two rings and on 00th_august collected my fiance '_s ring .
0	my ring still didn_'_t arrive , and when i went to the store few_days ago to check upon it '_s status again , the lady told me she cannot help me as the ring wasn_'_t dispatched by supplier and she didn_'_t know when will it be delivered .
0	when i told her how important it is for me to have this ring , she says she cant guarantee the ring to be delivered on time , she looked in her system and she found same ring but .... one size smaller in other branch in reading .
0	i decided to buy this ring as i didn_'_t want to end up with no ring at all .
0	the serving lady in reading i finally got me the ring , but when i looked at it - it was looking well worn with lots of scratches and some dents on it .
0	i don_'_t want and i can '_t keep this ring and now i have to return it as well as i have to return the ring of my fiancé .
0	now i have my wedding date set on 00 . 00 . 0000 but have no rings !
0	argos just simply ruined this most_important day by its negligence and unreliability !!
0	in any way i cannot imagine what can be done to fix this situation !
0	it is just unacceptable !
0	i am extremely disappointed and by every occasion i am going to worn people , telling them my story about the situation that argos put me into , just to save them from ending up with nothing because of unreliable and extremely incompetent company - argos !
0	as always with the whiskey_exchange the parcel was extremely well_protected and was delivery next_day via parcel_force .
0	the prices you can ’_t beat and the descriptions of the taste , smell etc is usually spot on .
0	i would recommend this company to anybody who_wants top quality drink at extremely competitive_prices .
0	i was after three genuine apple ma000g / b iphone leads but being as apple wanted £_00 per lead , i thought it might be best to have a quick look round to see what deals were on .
0	when i saw these on at £ 0 . 00 a piece i was a bit_wary as you have to wonder_how this kind of site can offer genuine products at such a low price but based on the description and gut_feeling , i decided to go with them ; it was a good choice .
0	as stated , they are genuine and exactly as the picture_shows .
0	they are clearly genuine but the only thing i expected them to come in was full retail packaging as stated instead of just being in the plastic holding band that all apple leads come in .
0	that said , i do not know what leads bought in an apple_store come packaged in but they would not be loose .
0	the postal details state that the items will be sent via_recorded delivery , however after one week they had still not arrived so i contacted nicecans to ask for a tracking_number .
0	it appeared that they had been sent via standard post and had been lost but nicecans had no issues with sending me another three units , this time via 0nd_class recorded delivery .
0	this was ok as the delivery details on the site state 0nd_class recorded however it would have been nice if they had been sent 0st_class to make up for the time loss but this is only a little_niggle .
0	they were very helpful and friendly when i rang up so that was great as i was expecting to get some rubbish excuse to try and get out of it so top_marks on that one .
0	the packaging was perfect and very robust for the items so no issues with that at all .
0	overall , i '_m very impressed and i will_definitely use them again despite the little hiccup but these things_happen and at_least they wanted to help and get the issue resolved which is more than some other_sellers .
0	i wish i could rate the review 0 . 0_stars as the only thing that let it down was the fact they had been sent standard post instead of recorded and it '_s unfair to mark it down when they did send the new items as per their website details .
0	many_thanks
0	mitch
0	cult_pens could not have provided a better service if they had tried .
0	i asked if they would price match another offer i had received which they had no issues with at all which saved me a great chunk of money and even included next_day special delivery at no extra_cost .
0	email communication was absolutely impeccable and i received replies within minutes .
0	i deal with three different people via_email but each was extremely_helpful and willing and seemed like they were working as a team .
0	the same was experienced when i rang up to place the order ; very pleasant and courteous .
0	the item was delivery on the exact date i asked for and was in immaculate_condition with superior packaging ; i did change the delivery destination and postal date after_placing the order but there were no issues at all in doing this so again another great positive point .
0	overall , a brilliant service and i will_definitely use again as and when i need .
0	talk_talk is by far the worst company to deal with .
0	called to give notice i am leaving , indian women said i need to speak to manager at customer loyalty , and transfers my call , after a 0min wait call goes dead .
0	same happens again .
0	write letter to head_office in southampton , no reply , send snotty email , then get a call from ' dave ' who sounded very indian to me .
0	asked why i am leaving and can he address my problems , explained to him , then said i need to speak to manager , gets put through to manager after a 00mins wait , who asked me why i am calling doh ' you called me ' !
0	he cannot help me and says i need to speak to manager .
0	what a complete_waste of time this company is .
0	i don_'_t care how much_cheaper talktalk are , i will happy pay alot more for my broadband in future , just so i do not have to deal with them again .
0	we were kept up to date via_email and text , fast delivery .
0	we will be using you again in future .
0	the radio is fantastic , well built and the sound quality is excellent , glad we ordered it
0	hanving paid the deposit for unlock pre_- order , these_people contacted me with their final price of gbp_000 . 00 for my iphone 0 00gb .
0	i contacted orange , who proceeded with full factory_unlock of the handset for gbp 00 . 00 .
0	busy claiming a refund of my deposit from official_iphone_unlock , who seek excuses in ther tc '_s stating the service has_been delivered , although i never accepted and proceeded with the upgrade to full factory_unlock and settling the oustanding balance .
0	do not pay more than you have to , do some_research first , people .
0	scammers !
0	they have about 0 websites all delivering in 0 - 0_weeks and only half the products0 the owners not a nice_bloke and has threatened many customers !
0	just google them !
0	ordered £_000 worth of stuff , just to have it left_outside my house by the cowboys from ' yodel '.
0	ordered a couple of bits for a computer i was building from ebuyer . com .
0	the prices were cheaper_than amazon and i didn_'_t have to worry_about that cowboy courier company ' yodel ' damaging my parcel like usual , especially because one of the items was a hdd .
0	the items arrived a week after ordering , which was not quick but it was just before_christmas , so they were busy and i forgive them .
0	the items were very well_packaged especially the hdd .
0	will be buying a new monitor from them soon .
0	thanks
0	quick and easy .
0	money transferred to my account same day they received my phone .
0	should also say i received full_amount unlike_some other similar companies who knock off money for small defects / marks / small scratches to the phone .
0	have used mazuma a number of times in the past and will_definitely use again in the future .
0	always a good selection , competitive_prices and first_class service .
0	i ordered rad new vans that i couldn_'_t find on the high_st , cheaper_than other_websites i found them on .
0	urban_industry has a great browsing system and interface .
0	only took two_days for the order to arrive .
0	shame i already got mud on them ...
0	i ordered two items for my girlfriend in october ( for christmas !)
0	when the package turned_up , the delivery note said both items were present , when only one was .
0	i emailed boohoo customer_services , got an answer back within a day and told that the item was still in stock , i said i would like it and thought that would be that .
0	i still_haven_'_t received anything , i have had about 0 emails answered with the automated_response of thanks for being patient and sorry for the inconvenience .
0	how many other customer '_s money is sitting in their bank_account .
0	avoid like the plague .
0	this autocentres is the best i have ever visited , i had a flat back tyre so having limited options i called the aa for road side assistance , having more knowledge into the flat tyre , it was just a slow_puncture .
0	the aa man suggested , to go the local garriage which was only 000_yards from were i was stationed .
0	my son had come_across this eden tyres & servicing from an app called near me , which located this garage ( by chance ) because it was the closest in my area .
0	the loverly polite staff took a look at the tyre described that it was a slow_puncture , so they offered to examine the tyre , so the polite staff , took care by placing a sheet over the driver '_s seat to stop it getting dirty and examined my car for free .
0	this was a total shock to me , it was such a reliable examination , no exaggeration , it was also a fast examination , only sitting in the waiting room for only 0 minutes .
0	to my surprise they had repaired the puncture free of charge what a survive .
0	they did not try to sell any tyres , but told us the truth .
0	i asked how much they charge for a replacement , and to my amazement they told me that it only cost , £_00 and where i normally go in chesterfield it cost £_00 , what a saving .
0	so to conclude i will_definately be visiting again , and if you are in the local area of 0 & 0 pentrich road ( opposite screwfix ), giltbrook industrial park , giltbrook , nottinghamshire ng00 0uz ., near the ikea , please give them a visit because they have amazing services at great prices and such a polite and willing service , which everyone will warm to .
0	please give them a ring at :_00000_000000
0	i have been using ebuyer for my pc builds for well over 0 years_now , and i can_honestly_say i have never had an issue with the service they provide .
0	their free delivery is a blessing , and their charged shipping is at a reasonable price for those times when i '_ve needed things through next_day .
0	all items are well_packaged , with plenty of " stuffing " to keep components safe during_transit .
0	they stock a wide_variety of products ; from value for when you '_ve not got the cash to shop for big_name brands , to said big_name brands .
0	though it should be said whether you shop for either they are all of a high_quality .
0	defaults in products happen , and that isn_'_t the fault of the company shipping the product to you ( unless they make it of course !
0	); so on the one or two occasions that i '_ve been delivered a faulty product , i was very pleased that i had absolutely no issue with the returns service ebuyer provide .
0	their response to my issue was quick , and i got my replacement quickly .
0	i know this review sounds_like a massive advertising campaign for ebuyer , but given the many_years i '_ve been using them and how well i '_ve been treated as a customer i think it '_s well_deserved .
0	i look_forward to many more years of great deals , and happy shopping !
0	fantastic service and quick delivery .
0	product arrived in excellent condition and with adequate packaging .
0	will_definitely be using again .
0	sold old_htc_desire with a broken screen for £_00 .

0	very simple and easy process would_gladly use them again
0	response was quick .
0	arrived on time .
0	did the job quickly and to a high_standard .
0	slightly pricier_than some other services , but for the quality and lack of hassle i thought it was worth it .
0	would highly_recommend .
0	i used compare the market to compare quotes for insurance on my yaris .
0	i filled in one form in minutes and got a load of quotes to compare .
0	i ended_up getting a great deal and also got myself a free meerkat toy .
0	god_bless aleksandr orlov !

0	exactly as expected first_class
0	really fast , simple and easy !
0	would reccomend to everybody !
0	i sent my phone off on the wednesday and the money was in my bank on the thursday so it was a very fast service .
0	got a cheap last_minute deal with these_people .
0	the rep was great , the hotel fab and the skiing great .
0	would go again , but doubt i will ever get that price again , £_000 for the week !
0	bought two or three_times and always the advise of the women on the phones is excellent .
0	everything fits and if there is ever an issue they always sort_out there and then .
0	good prices and a vast_range of skiwear .
0	one of the best on the internet .
0	the instrument to everywhere .
0	the gateway to shopping paradise .
0	how would we work , play or pis $ without them ?
0	ordered a few_times .
0	these_guys are okay but sometimes there is a stock problem that they don_'_t let you know about until after you '_ve ordered .
0	not an issue , but would be nice to know at time of ordering .
0	ordered a couple of times and a complete_waste of time .
0	should be banned from the internet , a complete_joke .
0	fantastic range , amazing service and fast delivery .
0	all that , everyone has .
0	these_people have this plus they have the best price on the internet .
0	they should be the biggest and best for outdoor , camping and skiwear anywhere in the uk .
0	no doubt they will be .
0	i have used overclockers . co . uk a lot over the past year , every time the service has_been excellent .
0	i '_ve had problems with most of the other online pc component retailers in the uk , but not a single_issue with overclockers .
0	i highly_recommend them as first choice .
0	i occasionally buy from tesco online and the delivery is always very fast regardless of whatever postage i choose .
0	i bought mobile_phone last_year off them for roughly_£_00 delivered .
0	took about 0 days to arrive but strangely i ended_up getting a postage refund , tesco said it was delayed : s , so the phone only cost £_00 delivered :)
0	great service every time :)
0	i bought some speakers for £_00 which arrived faulty i sent them back and got a refund of £_00 ...
0	i '_m not sure how thats even legal : s
0	so many people down - voting carphone_warehouse because of yodel .
0	yes yodel are terrible , and they shouldn_'_t legally be allowed to call themselves a delivery company .
0	and yes , carphone_warehouse shouldn_'_t be using them .
0	there is an obvious and simple way to get around this though .
0	select the " deliver to store " option .
0	i read all these reviews and decided to give this a try .
0	it worked beautifully !
0	the phone i '_ve been wanting for a while ( nexus_0 ) on the contract i wanted ( cheap as chips ) when i wanted it ( next_day ) with no_fuss_whatsoever !
0	avoid yodel at all costs - but don_'_t miss out on a good deal because of it .
0	maybe carphone_warehouse will pull their finger out and give these_idiots the boot eventually ... but until then you can still use them , get good service and a great deal too .
0	most painless mobile i '_ve ever got .
0	ordered more than a few items from deep_blue now and always receive items in a timeous fashion .
0	when i '_ve called into the shop for some info prior to ordering the staff have always been very friendly and knowledgable .
0	bottom_line is if you need any training gear then give them a try , you wont be let_down on service and you just might save a few_bob .
0	after royal_mail increased their prices i have been looking for a good quality service with good pricing .
0	i decided to give transglobal_express a go , the item was collected promptly and arrived in great condition the next_day .
0	i would recommend transglobal to anyone , their prices are much_better_than going direct with some of the companies which is a big plus for me .
0	i will be using them again in the future without a doubt .
0	i have to sat the slot games are big strength of kerching - there are obvious titles like ghostbusters and da vinci diamonds but lots of others to enjoy too and i have had some good wins to boot !
0	:) having said that , i really enjoyed roulette too .
0	customer service is good and i have never had any_issues with payouts / withdrawals etc .
0	they have the biggest selection and they even still carry jack0d and oxy elite pro !
0	their prices are beyond fair and even give you a better deal if you find a better price else where .
0	seriously there is no other reason to go_anywhere_else .
0	my first experience of cex has_been very smooth , indeed .
0	i wanted to trade - in the game , rayman_legends for wii_u . cex had the best trade - in price for cash , so i signed_up and went through the process .
0	one of the highlights would have to be the mailing label being absolutely free .
0	excellent !
0	then , it was as simple as packaging up the game and posting it through the nearest postbox .
0	within 00 or so days , they had received it , processed it and sent the cash via bank_transfer .
0	simple .
0	not the fastest way , sure .
0	but via post , not bad at all .
0	being so simple , i am sure to use them again in the future .
0	i have often heard of cex , but had never used them before .
0	so , it was a nice_surprise to find that their service was very straight - forward and smooth .
0	i highly_recommend them !
0	earlier this year , i needed a replacement power_supply for my computer .
0	scouring the internet like i normally do , i found that ccl had the best deal and good stock_levels .
0	and with a few simple clicks , i created the order and awaited the despatch email .
0	it arrived in good time and everything was in order .
0	simple as that .
0	on a side note , i don_'_t understand the bad_reviews on trustpilot .
0	i '_ve been using ccl since_0000 when i bought a laptop from them and have never had any_issues with orders , then or now .
0	and because of that , i look_forward to ordering from them again very soon .
0	i hadn_'_t heard of hifix before , but they were the cheapest when i was looking for some qav speakers , so i tried them out .
0	not only did i get the cheapest price and free delivery , i also got fast next_day delivery !
0	i ' d definitely use them again and it '_s comforting to know there are other shops online that cater so well for hi -_fi items .
0	i signed_up for a recent deal at e0save for a t - mobile full_monty sim - only deal .
0	it was billed at £ 00pm for 00m with a free refurbished nexus_0 00gb .
0	all was ok to start with , signup was painless and their delivery company dpd were spot on .
0	fast forward 0_weeks and i got a text from t - mobile saying they '_ve been trying to contact me and this is the last chance to pay my bill .
0	i '_ve not had any previous communication , so this seemed a bit_weird .
0	noticed that my mobile data wasn_'_t working , so tried registering on the t - mobile website ( that '_s nicely broken at the moment ) so gave up and called t - mobile .
0	got hold of a very bored sounding lady , who confirmed my account was overdue to a cancelled dd ( first i ' d heard of it !)
0	and i needed to pay £_00 to restore my service .
0	i queried the amount and she confirmed that i should be paying £_00 a month and pretty_much refused to believe me about the £_00 agreed with e0save .
0	checked all my stuff from e0save and it '_s all above board , with no mention of redemption or cashback from them etc_etc .
0	so it just looks_like either i was mis_- sold or they ' re just incompetent .
0	either way , not exactly re - assuring and i '_ve got no way to rectify it because they ' re shut at weekends .
0	guess i won_'_t be calling anyone tonight then !
0	my advice , go_elsewhere for your mobile needs .
0	i had my first real problem with virginmedia when i upgraded my broadband and ordered a tivo_box ( standard v + box is god_awful slow after being used to a skyhd box ) i haggled a deal with their indian_call_centre where i ' d only pay £_00 instead of £_00
0	sadly , as i soon found out , i was lied to and my bill showed the full_amount .
0	rang cs who advised me to cancel the dd as they had no way of refunding my money .
0	done that and then i got a £_00 charge for a dd failure .
0	called again , and was told it was all sorted .
0	sadly the next bill still showed the £_00 charge .
0	called and spoke to their complaints_department who said they wouldn_'_t have said that ( awfully nice to be called a liar by a complaints_department !)
0	but conveniently they didn_'_t record these call to the off - shore department , so i couldn_'_t prove it
0	at this point i raised a complaint with ofcom about being mis_- sold and sent an email to the ceo '_s office at vm .
0	only then did i get someone that understood customer service , who_apologised and promptly refunded my account with the money .
0	couple all this with their rubbish traffic management ( 00_% speed reduction on uploads !!)
0	and you ' re better off looking elsewhere .
0	as soon as my contract is up i '_m jumping ship to bt_infinity
0	great service , would happily buy stuff from them again !
0	i came_across 0000rpm when looking for some writeable dvds on ebay .
0	they were shipped very fast and had the best prices i could_find on the internet here in the uk .
0	the next time i needed discs i just searched for 0000rpm on google and came_across their website .
0	prices were slightly_lower_than on ebay , but you do have to pay for delivery :(
0	the range is better on their website , but like i said , you pay for delivery .
0	personally , i ' d prefer it if prices were a little_bit cheaper but still with free delivery ( since they don_'_t have to pay ebay fees ) but you can '_t have everything .
0	still , highly_recommended if you want blank discs in the uk
0	i would recommend liberty_flights to anyone that smokes e_- cigs .
0	the have great value products and they are good .
0	also lots of variety .
0	i bought the 0cm topper to replace my 0cm egg shaped topper from argos and man what a difference !
0	the one from memory_foam warehouse is by far a superior quality then the argos and was almost the same price .
0	therefore the argos one was returned after 0 night .
0	will_deffo be back here if i need more .
0	instant rns alert .
0	it '_s exactly_what every investor needs .
0	keep it up
0	very quick delivery product as expected and even cheaper then the manufacturer '_s website .
0	plus free next_day delivery
0	i bought an iphone repair then realised due to repair time would not be able to send package due to holiday .
0	they immediately provided a refund with no_hassles !
0	0 * customer service
0	simply excellent service all_round .
0	would highly_recomend to anyone .
0	placed an order for a nice bouqet for my girlfriends_birthday .
0	in the picture and as_described they sounded lovely for the price .
0	when they were delivered they were disappointing and left me feeling embarrassed .
0	stems were snapped , a few of the flowers looked as if they were dying already and the arrangement was poor .
0	the greeting_card was small and lacked imagination and a personal_touch .
0	just another printed note for another customer ... no love or feeling involved .
0	deflated , and unimpressed by the standard i expected .
0	this is the first time i have used your company and as this was a bouquet for a special birthday i wont be using you again or recommending your company .
0	i hope you can learn from this feedback and make_sure others receive a better quality of flower in future .
0	thank_you
0	i was very impressed that they double_checked with me that i wanted the item shipped to a different address .
0	there was a technical fault and my item wasn_'_t shipped , but when i emailed to enquire what was happening , the lady_who dealt_with my email was very helpful , sorted the issue out straight_away and refunded the postage_costs .
0	you can '_t avoid things going wrong sometimes , but i think you get the measure of a company by how they fix things which have gone_wrong ; based on my experience with mpb i would have no_reservations recommending them to others
0	ordered a few sets of cards from moo . com without_any_issues , the prices are a little expensive but you get good quality business_cards .
0	they also they do a variety of other card types and allow you to customise the front and back layouts with the option to use ready - made designs .
0	the alignment on one order were a slightly off this was probably down to the size of the image i uploaded , highly_recommended !
0	been shopping with amazon since they were formed , have brought lots of books from them and always received the products ordered on time .
0	returns and replacements are dealt_with swiftly by their customer_support_team on electronic items which have gone faulty within the warranty_period .
0	ordered items lost in delivery are investigated and replacements are sent whilst the investigation takes place , all you have to do is send back one of the packages if both eventually arrive .
0	as other_reviewers have stated , please be weary of the marketplace listings as they can be problem - some can be cheaper or more_expensive than buying from amazon uk .
0	just make_sure when buying that you check the " sold by " and the prices from marketplace_sellers and products supplied directly from amazon uk .
0	just such a quick and painless experience .
0	lots of customisation_options to find the perfect hostel .
0	also offers 0 % cashback through_quidco !
0	the customer service was amazing after the mix_up with paypal , i will_definitely use here again !
0	ordered bf0 and within 00 seconds the key was in my inbox ready to be redeemed , used cjs multiple_times before with the same results and will_definitely use them again !

0	ordered a new mouthpiece for my reg on a friday_afternoon and it arrived on a monday_morning .
0	very happy with the item and the delivery time .
0	i have had many deliveries from dpd and to be honest i wish every company was dpd style .
0	they are efficient and proactive and everything and more a delivery company should be .
0	dpd notify you your parcel is scheduled for delivery before the actual supplier and in which you already know what time it '_s going to be in your home and the delivery drivers_name .
0	00 stars from me .
0	keep_up the good work i '_m a happy customer .
0	viovet is so easy to use and the site is user_friendly with extra tools to help manage re - ordering items on a rotation .
0	the service is fast and no friction or fuss .
0	the items are always in stock and readily_available when you need them .
0	the best prices around too , cheaper_than amazon and ebay .
0	i had a problem with re - directing the pages and the support_team helped_me fix my problem in 0 minutes !
0	absolutely great place to get all of your supplements whether you ' re wanting to gain weight or lose_weight supplement_warehouse has everything you need at a low affordable price .
0	i always buy from here and recommend this to anyone who_wants to get a good deal .
0	hi i recently had my seat alhambra serviced from national in derby they were fast efficient and very friendly all in all a very cheap option from the dealers
0	it was the first time i purchased from londonperfumeshop . co . uk , and the item was delivered on time .

0	customer service is good , and i have always been provided with detailed_information with regard to the location of accommodation .
0	betting is easy on betfair .
0	had a gas_leak and chris wood sorted it out really quickly .
0	he arrived right on time and was very professional .
0	we need a new boiler and would defo_use pimlico for it .
0	got my order delivered not the day after but because i placed it around 0pm .
0	got it the second day in the early morning and exactly at the time that the text said they would .
0	best price i could_find as well for what i was looking for so overall an excellent service .
0	will buy again for sure .
0	used twice so_far .
0	will_continue to use them as they are exactly_what i would expect from a top web business .
0	keep it up !
0	ordered some goods for my bros christmas_present .
0	supposed to be delivered on the 0th , still nothing .
0	support email on the confirmation_email is a fake .
0	then i saw this site .
0	i won_'_t be holding my breath for the goods .
0	let '_s face it , they probably don_'_t even have a bottle of aspirin .
0	avoid !
0	the website is good and easy to use .
0	you can find what you nees quickly and the booking process was simple and quick .
0	will_definitely be using again !
0	do not use this company
0	work overpriced ( more than double local companies ), engineers did not turn_up ( i waited more than 0_weeks and they missed four appointments ) and they were extremely rude when they did actualy contact me .
0	and for all of this , they actually charged me for the pleasure - without actually completing any work .
0	still fighting for a refund !
0	awsome just awsome
0	but dont use dpd again !
0	i ordered a small pair of earphones from amazon and they are being posted by you .
0	i got next_day delivery .
0	i ordered them last sunday and still havnt received them , we even put a clearer sign out side our house to exclude that , we couldnt find you excuse because we saw you drive past our house !
0	and again same email to the exact word .
0	now ill get the same message as everyone_else which probably wont work and receive no explanation .
0	why ?
0	easy too use checkout system through paypal
0	fast browsing for a range of unique titles
0	dispatched very promptly
0	would use again and recommend to anyone
0	stawberries and cream_flavour was great not to sweet and mixes up well with milk or water .

0	fantastic selection of parts and fast shipping time !
0	ordered a charger board for a sony_vaio that i couldn_'_t find anywhere on the internet which shipped to denmark , but lappyparts had it and i got it within 0 days !
0	highly_recommended for any one who want to be sensible about supplements and spending '_s on in ( well happy about all the range off the products and quality 0 )) alight maybe the packaging is not that fancy but if you after what '_s inside then myprotein . co . uk is your choice !
0	great range of quality products for a bargain price
0	great service , quick replies and all sorted .
0	i purchased a tv from appliances direct .
0	as soon as i went to check out , they automatically add £_00 worth of rubbish i didnt ask for or want to the basket .
0	once removed i clicked the how much delivery will be button : £ 0 . 00 , but when i went to check out after filling these details in this prices wasnt available as i live in aberdeen ( aberdeen is not highlands !)
0	as my wife and i work full time i paid the extra money for the tv to be delivered on the saturday .
0	we sat inside all day waiting for the tv to arrive ( no approximate_time is given ).
0	no tv arrived .
0	i phoned the expensive helpline on monday and after sitting on hold , going through lots of menus i eventually explained the situation .
0	i was promised a call within_00hrs .
0	i waited the two_days .
0	no tv arrived and i received no phone_call .
0	again i called and pretty_much started the proceedings again .
0	this time i was promised a call within 00_hrs .
0	again no delivery and i received no phone_call .
0	i phoned
0	again and found out nothing , they had no idea if the tv had been dispatched .
0	but this time i got an email_saying i need to wait a week for a responce ... im still_waiting .....
0	after i submitted the review , i was contacted by a member of their management_team and appologied to .
0	the investigation failed to find anything out , so another tv was scheduled for delivery two_weeks after the initial delivery was meant to be made .
0	due to the terrible service i received i asked for the price of the tv to be reduced to the now lower price being offered online and that i get a full_refund for the delivery cost .
0	i was promised both of these refunds .
0	after waiting in all saturday again i received no tv !!!
0	i also received neither of the refunds .
0	avoid_avoid_avoid .
0	very good service , product was very well priced and the delivery was very quick , cant_ask for much more .
0	ordered twice in the space of a few_days .
0	both products excellent , delivered within two_days and have been a fantastic upgrade to my ailing netgear homeplug kit .
0	fantastic service .
0	when other retails faltered over the hp pre0 debacle , cleverboxes won through .
0	fantastic service right from order , through to delivery .
0	highly_recommended .
0	was helped by sarah_hayes , she was quick with the information i needed , and was very helpful in sorting the query i had with my order .
0	many_thanks !
0	as always , awesome service & very quick delivery .
0	i always look at ocuk first when i '_m wanting new computer parts , as i know they have great customer service & will have the item i '_m wanting at a good price .
0	only_slight_niggle , is that occasionally they ' re a couple of £ more than competitors on some items , but once the free_postage is taken into account ( i '_m an active member on the forums , so i also get free delivery ) it works out cheaper anyway , so i '_m happy enough :)
0	i love campus gifts always find things for people as presents and the delivery is really quick .
0	and u can sometimes get a really good bargin when things go on sale !
0	best place to buy gifts !!!!
0	:-)
0	good product .. definatley_reccomend to anyone to buy from you , will be buyi g more stuff once ive been paid again .. ;-) 0star !!
0	!
0	goods came as_described and in time .
0	0rd edit_:
0	just had an extremely arrogant chap call me up from chess to tell me that i owe them money and that because i have ignored all their efforts to contact me over this debt his department the escalated debt department were now dealing_with the matter .
0	because of the tone taken i asked to speak to [_name ]' s supervisor but he refused to do this .
0	it was very clear that [_name_] didn_'_t have a clue regarding any of the account history and that he didn_'_t believe a word i said on the phone .
0	so after countless_emails and a few telephone_calls chess are still claiming that i have never contacted them and that i owe them money ( which they are adding fees to despite their claims of no small_print )
0	one to avoid .
0	so yet another example of chess '_s terrible customer_services and dodgy business_practices .
0	one to avoid 0 / 00 .
0	0nd edit_:
0	just a note to say that chess have been in touch again .
0	interestingly chess have decided to try and hold me to terms and conditions which i have never signed_up to or agreed to .
0	i signed_up through thevirtualnumbercompany and this website still says " no small_print " and " 00 days cancellation notice "
0	they claim that they have not received any of the numerous email that i have sent to them .
0	chess are amongst the most dishonest companies i have ever_encountered .
0	0 / 00 terrible company .
0	original text :
0	i became a chess_telecom customer through the virtual phone number company around 00 months_ago .
0	i have two lines , one is a local number the other is an 0000 number .
0	both are on a 00 day rolling agreement .
0	they have consistently overcharged me line rental and despite_numerous attempt to get them to rectify the situation they have simply ignored me .
0	their staff on the phone can see that i am being charged too much but cant understand_why or do anything about it .
0	so after almost 00 months i gave them their marching orders .
0	having paid one month in advance and being on a one month deal i don_'_t owe them anything .
0	they owe me !
0	however as they can '_t even get the basic billing right i doubt i have any chance of getting the money they owe me !
0	to add_insult to injury chess have ignored my cancellation and have continued to send bills .
0	i have cancelled the direct_debit with the bank but this hasn_'_t deterred them .
0	i have replied to every email they have sent but have never had a response in return .
0	now they are adding fees to the account and threatening me with their legal team who will apparently pursue me .
0	yet it is they who owe me money !
0	so here the bottom_line .
0	if you choose chess they will overcharge you , they will ignore your emails and when you choose to leave they will_continue to bill you and threaten you .
0	0 / 00 from me .
0	terrible company .
0	edit .
0	: i have now been contacted by someone from chess_telecom .
0	however that person denied the company was overcharging me and when i said i was not in the office at the moment and was unable to give detailed_information about the over charging because i didn_'_t have the invoices in front of me , the put the phone down .
0	another great example of chess telecoms terrible customer service .
0	i should also add that a message has_been left on the answering_machine asking me to call them up on a premium_rate number !
0	so again 0 / 00 terrible company .
0	having been a customer with ybs for a long time i always believed they were better_than the banks and that i could trust them .
0	this changed when i was overcharged by a third_party using direct_debit .
0	when i tried to claim the money back using the direct_debit guarantee i found it wasn_'_t worth the paper it was written on .
0	they refused to give a full and immediate_refund and while i did eventually get my money refunded it took a lot of time and hassle .
0	it wasn_'_t the worry free experience the guarantee offers .
0	if you are looking for a trust_worthy alternative to the high_street banks , the ybs isn_'_t it .
0	sadly .
0	akinika is one of the worst companies i have ever had the misfortune to deal with .
0	when they called me they claimed to be her majesties revenue and customs calling about tax credits .
0	it soon turned_out that the akinika employee was being dishonest as they did not have information which hmrc have .
0	akinika claimed that i have been overpaid tax credits and that i have received and ignored a letter they have sent me .
0	neither is true .
0	the akinika staff refused to log the dispute and refused to investigate , they simply demand i make payment to them immediately .
0	they even refused to provide information about their company , even their address .
0	akinika have a website but it doesn_'_t list the companies registered address , or any address .
0	it doesn_'_t list the companies registration details or status .
0	there is no provision to make a complaint .
0	this company doesn_'_t care for normal uk trading_laws or debt_collection regulations .
0	took 0 month payment in advance , yet when we left after two years they forgot about that and refused to give us our money back .
0	leaving us £_00 out of pocket .
0	after selling a product and receiving payment through paypal i shipped it confidently .
0	however when the buyer received it they decided they wanted it cheaper and paypal removed the whole amount from my account .
0	this meant i had no product and no money .
0	ebay just doesn_'_t care about its customers .
0	it is geared up for handing disputes between buyers and sellers but when ebay gets it wrong you might as well talk to the wall .
0	just remember , the bigger they are , the harder they fall .
0	i '_m giving up on ebay because they keep ignoring me .
0	i always love buying from guitar_bitz as they have a very fast method of getting my goods to me through interlink_express .
0	their website has a very nice layout which is easy to navigate and their 00 point check ensures any guitar i buy from them is immaculate .
0	they ' v got a life long customer in me .
0	bought my acer predator g0000 which arrived very quickly ( 0 days ).
0	i was consistantly notified via e_- mail and text on the were abouts of my product .
0	very happy with my product and the cheap deal i got .
0	having just sent off my second old phone and received my argos_voucher back in a couple of days i can highly_recommend this service !, very good communication by email , fast postage of both the pre_paid bag and the payment voucher - mush faster_than the alternative of selling it yourself on a well_known auction_site .
0	thanks !
0	great prices , good service , highly_recommended !
0	i came here for a specific shirt my sister told me about , and when i saw all of the other products i was very impressed .
0	i will_definitely come_back again !
0	i bought a new car at the grimsby branch with a trade - in of my old car .
0	the process was very smooth , ran at my own_pace and carl middleton who looked after me answered any questions i had .
0	he even answered my calls out of hours as i was often busy during the day , very impressed !
0	thanks again
0	i spent_ages searching for a very specific bag i wanted , and tactical - kit was the only uk supplier i came_across .
0	originally it was out of stock on the website , so i enquired when it will be back in stock .
0	i received a reply within half an_hour , and was notified that the staff had searched the warehouse and found a single one available for purchase .
0	i made further enquiries about the product , and each reply i got was within a few minutes of each other .
0	very pleased with the fast and very helpful feedback ( may i mention again that they searched the warehouse for it , instead of just giving me a " sorry no out of stock " like some other_suppliers would ), i placed my order , and recieved it 0 days_later ( only chose basic delivery ).
0	great customer service !
0	!
0	apart_from ordering , the site is fast , very clean looking and easy to navigate , with brown fonts overlayed on a dark background , very easy on the eyes and keeping that tactical theme without going overboard , plus no crappy flash animations to chug the site down or crash your browser .
0	everything is categorized with detailed_descriptions to ensure you know what you are getting .
0	they sell a wide_variety of stuff , from clothing , hiking_gear , bags , lasers and optical sights , eye_wear , plus many many more !
0	overall , very pleased with the fast communication and the fact they put some effort into checking whether the product was really out of stock .
0	would highly_recommend it as your one stop_shop for tactical goods .
0	on an extra note , like the reviewer below posted , stay clear from nightgear : dodgy folk they are , don_'_t be_fooled_by their flashy discounts and offers .
0	i have heard bad things about fitness first , but i decided to have a look for myself .
0	on first_impressions , fitness first seemed very basic .
0	truth be told they were renovating some areas , but still it seemed quite subpar .
0	i enquired_about membership details , and was briefed by one of the staff .
0	i wasn_'_t shown around the area for some reason , so the actual conditions and facilities remained a mystery to me .
0	since i would soon be travelling_abroad , i decided to hand over my contact details to them for more information about membership in the future , which turned_out to be my biggest mistake .
0	fast forward a week_later , i was packing for holiday when my phone rang .
0	turned_out to be someone from fitness first who sounded just like ali g ( rudeboy accent ?)
0	who wanted to talk more about the membership i enquired_about .
0	i politely told_him that i was currently busy packing for holiday and would like to talk more about this when i return to the uk , however he was not willing to accept this and continued to talk about the membership plan .
0	i then politely told_him a second time that i was busy packing , to which he rudely hung_up on me mid sentence , which i have to say really irritated me .
0	00_minutes later , my phone blared at me again , another person from fitness first with the same intentions .
0	whilst he wasn_'_t as rude as the previous person , it was at this point i ended_up blocking the phone number from contacting me directly ever again .
0	will i ever get to finish packing today ??
0	i could imagine a queue of fitness first staff just waiting to turn my phone into a christmas_tree .
0	never again will i want to associate with fitness first and their etiquettes , like a bunch of obnoxious school kids waiting in line at a sweet shop to pester the cashier .
0	in short , i really cannot recommend fitness first to anyone and would advise people to not even bother enquiring_about joining .
0	if the staff are that rude and persistent to a potential curious new member to their gym , i dread to think the treatment i will receive upon becoming an actual member , and that '_s forgetting all the bad_stories i '_ve heard .
0	i was looking for a decent mechanical_pencil for drawing and came_across a particular_brand i liked ( staedtler 000 00 to be exact ), so off to google it was , and cult_pens was the first answer to pop up .
0	what striked me first was the presentation as everything is clean , very fast loading and extremely easy to navigate , you will have no problem whatsoever finding exactly_what you want within a few_seconds as everything is organised into subsections , instead of being bunched up together like most other_sites do .
0	there is plenty of information about their products , and in some cases a drop down_menu to specify different_colours , lead sizes , quantity , etc .
0	fantastic !
0	also there is a " pencyclopedia ," a section devoted to everything about pens and pencils , all the fancy technical do - das and what pen is best for what purpose .
0	the information i found was extremely useful and helped_me not only decide on my purchase , but reassure me these_people are passionate_about pens and aren_'_t in it soley for the money .
0	oh and of course there is a massive_range of pens , pencils , rulers , rubbers , leads and stuff from many different companies and perhaps even a rare item or two .
0	plus free uk delivery on orders over £_00 , how could one refuse !
0	i didn_'_t , and i recieved my mechanical_pencil next_day , plus a free_gift to boot .
0	very happy about my experience with them .
0	it '_s very rare i ' d buy from a site without reading a review about them first , but i made an exception with cult_pens within 00_minutes of browsing and wasn_'_t dissapointed .
0	clean easy to navigate site , massive_range of drawing utensils , the pencyclopedia explaining everything about pens and pencils , and the feeling that these_people are here to help and not to clean out your wallet .
0	only thing i think could be improved is have the pencyclopedia section easier to find for newcomers , perhaps listed clearly on the home page , apart_from that everything else is perfect .
0	chiquitos has to be the worst dining experience i '_ve ever had .
0	having never eaten there before , i was excited to try out their menu , but my eagerness soon turned to utter dissapointment .
0	first and last time i '_ll ever go there .
0	upon_arriving at the entrance , we were looked at by the passing staff , but not spoken to or acknowledged , which was very strange .
0	when we were finally allowed to sit_down in one of the darkened corners of the restaurant , the staff_member took his sweet time in finding menus for us , which actually was just the beginning of this painfully_slow service .
0	you ' d think ordering a simple beverage would be as simple as either opening a can or filling the glass up from a dispenser .
0	no idea what the staff were doing as the drinks took around 0 minutes to arrive which probaly isn_'_t that long to wait ... had it not been us as 0 of the only 0 tables occupied in the entire restaurant .
0	the starters took 00_minutes to arrive , and the nacho - things we ordered where actually moist and tasted stale , and it was barely warm and didn_'_t taste great .
0	it was at this point when i realised i needed to get out of here , but we still waited for the rest of our meal .
0	as for the main course , it took a good 00 or so minutes to arrive .
0	and even then , it wasn_'_t even hot , just luke_warm .
0	infact i stuck my fingers in it and took a photo to post on my facebook to share my experiences with my friends , which prompted them to also reveal they had bad_experiences eating at chiquitos .
0	the restaurant is not even busy and i have no idea what the chefs in the kitchen are doing , but a bunch of meatballs and some rice surely can '_t take that long to cook ?
0	sure_enough , we weren_'_t the only ones suffering , as another table near us was complaining_about the service .
0	i couldn_'_t be_bothered to complain , having worked a mean shift earlier and not in the mood for confrontation .
0	well , thank_god it all came to an end and as i left , i muttered " i can '_t wait to get out of here " to one of the tables as we were leaving .
0	last time i ever set foot in any of their branches .
0	being involved in the food industry myself ( just as a regular chef mind you , not a managerial expert so don_'_t think i '_m a know - it - all ), i can '_t help but mention that there are so many things wrong with chiquitos , especially with the professionalism of the staff , i '_m baffled they still remain in business .
0	unfortunately the experience was so bad i started_using the chiquitos word to describe things i dislike , albeit with slightly mispelt letters to rhyme with a certain naughty word .
0	i ' d definately recommend to everyone to avoid chiquitos at all cost to prevent utter dissapointment and a waste of money .
0	like i said , first and last time i '_ll go there .
0	i '_ve brought from shopto . net a fair few_times , it was highly_recommended by a friend and i can see why .
0	free p_&_p and decent prices compared to retail shop prices , plus fast delivery and excellent customer service .
0	one time the postman nicked my game , and i emailed shopto . net for a replacement , and i got a reply within the hour and it was all dealt_with the very same day i emailed , which i thought was brilliant .
0	just thought i ' d point that out as most companies take an aeon and a half to reply emails ( if at all ) so i do really apprecieate the support staff getting back to me quickly and professionally .
0	thanks alot : d
0	i ' d highly_recommend shopto . net if you ' re doing your shopping online , they also do alot of deals from time to time , and they got a loyalty system ( which i have yet to venture_into ).
0	booked a last_minute budget stag_do through chillisauce , the website was easy to browse and look at various activities , and even easier to sort_out who was coming and who had paid etc .
0	the go - karting itself was brilliant fun on the day and everything was ready for our arrival .
0	it was enjoyed by everyone even the cuts , grazes and bruises !
0	thanks alot
0	this was my first hostel stay ever , and i was almost disappointed by how nice this was ( because i was looking_forward to a bit of an ' experience ').
0	the room was nicer than most hotel_rooms i '_ve been in , with the exception that we had two nice roommates from portugal .
0	and i couldn_'_t believe_how cheap it was .
0	i ' d highly_recommend this place for a comfortable stay in prague , and the location was great !
0	after_seeing all these posts i am wondering what is going on .
0	i also paid for the tracking service and like everyone_else have not had a tracking_link , my girlfriend just text me to say they have still not arrived and she finished work at 0 - 00 .
0	if they cannot make a courier paid delivery by 0 - 00 when i ordered last_week for valentines_day then what is the point in buying the flowers ?
0	wish they had a phone number to ring , all i can do is hope they arrive by 0 - 00 otherwise she will get them tomorrow which i will be seriously annoyed about .
0	will update my rating to 0 if they arrive on valentines_day !
0	order no 00000
0	i '_ve ordered from bbw several_times now and the delivery always comes either the very next_day or the day after ( depending what time i order ) .
0	even at christmas the delivery was really fast
0	their customer service is top as well .
0	always replying to me via_email within a few hours , if not faster , and answering me on twitter in about 00_mins .
0	good quality products at really good prices and they really know their stuff
0	great if everything goes_smoothly but if they mess up they just ignore you .
0	even when you do get a reply to an email and you reply back to them again , they '_ll ignore you for about a week or 0
0	didn_'_t receive my order on the day i was supposed to so the next_day i phone up .
0	after waiting on the phone for over half an_hour i went through to an agent that muted their headset , they accidently took it off mute and i said " i know someone '_s there because you just took me off mute " then they hung_up the phone .
0	ended_up cancelling the order .
0	but yet they still sent it out 0 days_later ( it now being 0 day since it should have been delivered ).
0	this all happened at the end of june and i '_ve only just got my refund today .
0	absolutely_shocking service , and in my opinion , unreasonable delivery charges , will never use them again .
0	bodybuildingwarehouse is cheaper with free delivery and same quality .
0	they also maintain contact with customers , even speaking to me on twitter .
0	i '_ve had friend who have also had lots of problems with my protein and it '_s took them months to get refunds and have things rectified
0	i just needed a shaker_cup and i ended_up getting like 00 samples and some products that are about to expire for like $ 0 .
0	the shipping was about $_00 but it was well_worth it .
0	great service - i would recommend this company to anyone .
0	my campaigns have had excellent results !
0	i recently ordered a kimono from lovekimono for my girlfriend ’_s birthday , and she absolutely_loved it .
0	i wasn_’_t exactly sure which design to choose , so sent the guys at lovekimono an email to see if they could help .
0	they were more than happy to help me with their latest designs , and i ended_up choosing the miley kimono in grey for her .
0	the product came in next to no time at all , and it arrived beautifully_packaged ( which was good for me as i ’_m useless when it comes to wrapping presents !).
0	needless to say , my girlfriend now won_’_t stop wearing it !
0	i highly_recommend every_aspect of lovekimono – great customer service , great product and great quality !
0	this was my first time using the valet_parking and i would definitely use it again .
0	great service , easy to drop_off and even easier to pick_up when i returned .
0	just what you need after a long tiring_flight !
0	shopto are my number 0 choice for buying games .
0	excellent prices and outstanding delivery service .
0	guaranteed next_day delivery is just awesome .
0	ive bought tons from them and they never_fail .
0	great site !
0	i was a bit_hesitant at first to use cj '_s cd_keys , but now i '_m unsure why .
0	i have bought four titles off here now , 0 for steam and 0 for origin , and they have worked flawlessley every time .
0	it '_s also nearly always the cheapest place to find them as well , and since_discovering this place for big_name games , i can save myself a lot of cash .
0	thanks cjs
0	so after having my grand die and having an_emergency c section to save my daughter life i choose to order mine and my husbands funeral clothing on boohoo . com as in unable to move around to get to the shops !
0	my item was ment to be delivered yesterday which apparently it has_been left in a secure place ( why couldn_'_t you knock on the door ?)
0	so now after_contacting customer service i need to go print a form off and then send it back to them to get my items resent or refunded .
0	i don_'_t have a printer in my house so it means i '_m going to have to travel to the closest library to use one which isn_'_t open_till tuseday when my funeral is .
0	all in all boohoo have just added a bunch of stress on to a very stressful time .
0	i will never shop with you again .

0	always use parcel0go , easy to use website , great service and always sort any probs very quickly and effectively .
0	i made a mistake on my order but didn_'_t notice this until i had paid for it .
0	i thought never mind i '_ll cancel the order then re - order the correct items .
0	i cancelled it within 0 mins of placing it , then ordered the correct items on a seperate order only later to be told the order had already been processed and could not be cancelled ( why not ?
0	i clearly hadn_'_t left the warehouse within 0 minutes when i was ordering at 00 : 00 at night !)
0	so my order couldn_'_t be cancelled .
0	two_days_later i receive duplicate orders , and items i did not want .
0	i contacted my protein to return the items only to be told i would have to meet the cost of returning them .
0	an_absolute_disgrace i believe since they failed to prevent the items i didn_'_t want been sent in the first place .
0	this was a totally_unacceptable circumstance and my protein have just lost a good customer over this !
0	!
0	no_problems with buying points or xbox memberships .
0	it '_s cheaper_than through the console and your code is emailed within 0min .
0	paypal is added buyer security too !
0	had problems with an interface i purchased from here a few_years_ago .
0	the company just did not want to assist me in the matter .
0	luckily i found out later i just needed a driver update .
0	recently i purchased an active subwoofer from them .
0	the item became_faulty on its fourth use but i did not diagnose the problem to the unit until a few weeks_later .
0	from my first contact with them regarding the issue it took them 0_weeks to replace the faulty_unit , plus i had to contact the manufacturer to arrange the warranty cover myself !!
0	( this should be their job )
0	i did offer for them to credit_note me as i wanted some more_expensive items as an_alternative but they refused !
0	terrible service , incredibily difficult to get hold of there person in charge of service department ( sam ) and all_round bad_experience !
0	i will not be using them ever again and will make_sure all the contacts i know who also buy dj & sound equipment know to avoid this company .
0	i found it easy , quick and convenient to use tempcover and i had no_problems to speak of and the price was decent so overall i would reccomend .
0	personally i had no_problems my product arrived prompt and i didnt have to contact customer_services
0	product i wanted was 00 £ cheaper on here than what the vet wanted , free economy delivery , got my product , no_problems .
0	would definitely use again and recommend .
0	i have ordered from patrolstore twice and i will again as they always get the goods to you quickly and with no_hassle .
0	plus they stock lots of good stuff at good prices .
0	not cheap knock - offs either !
0	got bf0 ( russian ed ) for 00 £ it was not instant delivery despite the advertising saying it was , i got it after 0 + hours but i did get it in the end .
0	and it worked_fine , but it has made me think_twice about using them again .
0	you pay_peanuts , you get monkeys .
0	supplementwarehouse . com has the greatest sales of any online supplement website .
0	i just bought a product from them that was on sale to $ 0 . 00 , it was $_00 . 00 !
0	all other_sites i looked at , their sale price was actually higher_than the normal price for this product on supplementwarehouse . com .
0	it is very easy and also cheap .
0	every backpackers must look this site .
0	if you love your pocket you also love hostelbookers =))
0	i have used supplement_warehouse many_times now and i love it .
0	it has the best prices and all the brend name products out there .
0	i will never stop useing it .
0	i also love all the free stuff with every order .
0	this company has disgusting customer service i receive an email_saying my order has_been dispatched , so i take today off work to await my order , i call citylink who have stated that my order has not arrived , i then phone the drink_shop to which the receptionist who has no idea about customer service casually remarks with no hint of sympathy or regret that yea they received an email this morning and it was he fault that i had not been informed , i await my call back from a manager with great anticipation .
0	got a call back from a manager on the day we ad a chat about what went wrong and the company then shipped my order for next_day delivery which did arrive on time thankfully hopefully the incident i referred to in the paragraph above is a blip and a one off incident as the company appear to have fixed their customer service . issues
0	they kept me updated at all times by e_- mail , text and phone .
0	ordered on thursday and was delivered on sunday .
0	it was delivered first thing in the morning and the delivery men were helpful and polite .
0	would definately buy from this company again .
0	phones0cash is so simple and easy to use , no need to search everywhere to sell your phone you just go onto phones0cash and its all there for you .
0	phones0cash also gives me reviews on new phones so when my upgrade is due i can choose a phone from the help of phones0cash .
0	i recommend phones0cash to all my friends and they all come_back and thank me .
0	very happy with the service and product selection .
0	we were ordering a number of hard_disks ( 00 +); i found these to be the best price and selection around , the website was easy and quick to use and delivery took only 0 days .
0	really impressed and would use again for business or personal shopping .
0	all i can say is thanks to bratislava stags for one the best weekends away any of use had .
0	the hotel was fantastic and if you can mange to get up for breakfast it ’_s a great hangover cure .
0	the city was brilliant and the beer was so cheap they were nearly giving it away .
0	0 hours in one bar drinking pints and vodka red bulls came to about l00 each .
0	can '_t recommend the full shooting package enough , something everyone should try at_least once in their life .
0	but would suggest not doing it with a hang over !!
0	!
0	the pub_crawl was we organised and thanks to the kristina for keeping use together and then apparently saving me from a beating from a group of bouncers ( at trafo night club ) for being far to drunk .
0	very much_appreciated !
0	!
0	i went into specsavers and the range of glasses available was woeful .
0	i went to vision_express and the cost of the frames was over priced .
0	glasses_direct bridged the gap perfectly .
0	the ability to try before you buy for free completely erased my concerns with purchasing online .
0	order number : 000a000000
0	i strongly_recommend that you avoid purchasing a bed with dreams .
0	i spent_nearly_£ 0 , 000 on a bed with dreams in january .
0	eventually they arranged a delivery date for early april ( yes that long ) and i arranged a day off work to receive the bed .
0	as part of the order we paid £_00 . 00 for a bed recycle that meant i had to take apart my old wooden_frame bed for them to collect .
0	as the day went on i thought i had better chase dreams on a time for the delivery .
0	on making this call , we found out that dreams had cancelled our delivery without informing us , and that the bed would not be in stock again until may .
0	the old bed that had been taken apart was not in state to repair , so we just had an old mattress on the floor to sleep on .
0	i have a 0 month pregnant partner who was in a situation where we have to sleep on the floor for the final 0 months of the pregnancy .
0	i have had to purchase a 0nd_hand bed and pay a van to deliver , at my own_expense .
0	dreams , aware of the fact they are leaving a 0 month pregnant women to sleep on the floor , have been no help whatsoever , have not made any attempt to explain the reason for the cancelled delivery ( without forceful prompting from me ), or to explain_why we have had to wait nearly_half a year for a delivery .
0	0_weeks_ago i cancelled my order with dreams and demanded a full_refund ( phone and email ) and was told someone would get back to me on the matter to arrange the refund .
0	i just contacted dreams again , and they have not even updated my details to say the order is cancelled , so are expecting to deliver the bed in may .
0	so_far i have paid nearly_£ 0 , 000 for a bed i haven ’_t received and nearly_£_000 for a 0nd_hand bed and delivery to cover the inconvenience .
0	i also lost a day of holiday for the trouble ( a day i could have spent with my new_born baby ).
0	dreams offered my £_000 of vouchers in compensation .
0	when i laughed at the thought of ever spending money with them again , they offered £_000 cash , but given the stress they have caused both me and my partner , i don_’_t feel they deserve any sale from me .
0	this company have proven to be completely unreliable , unhelpful and uncooperative from day 0 .
0	please avoid at all costs .
0	yours ,
0	dan
0	you can do international_transfers direct to a bank_account , quickly , with very low fees , at a very good exchange_rate .
0	just couple of clicks and all done from your home and no bothering going to the bank or western_union or all this money transfer companies .
0	just 0 to 0 days ... normally its even quicker_than that .
0	and the customer service support it is very good as well which makes azimo 0_stars company .
0	dont change !
0	the training they provide is really helpful and in - depth .
0	i only used to use photoshop for designing mocks for people ( mainly teens ) on an amatuer site , nw i '_m helping my company with their graphics design board in marketing - its really opened up a lot of doors for me !

0	i ordered the indian man costume from allfancydress . com and it arrived very quickly .
0	the cost of the costume was great and it fit_perfectly too .
0	the site was easy to use and understand and i would definitely use them again .
0	all_round brilliant site .
0	i found dino_pc during a good search when i was planning a new pc .
0	after spending hours putting_together a spec on various different websites and it being way too overpriced dino_pc was by far cheaper and extremely reasonably_priced .
0	when i had confirmed my order a couple of days_later i decided to email them and ask for priority shipping after 0 days within the hour i received a call from alan from their customer_services ( nice_bloke ) and we completed the extra payment over the phone .
0	i received an email on the friday informing_me my order would be shipped later than planned but i had already expected it to be a bit later as it was coming up to the weekend .
0	i got my dispatch email yesterday from both dino_pc and the courier and it arrived this morning directly on time !
0	it was packaged extremely well , all of the necessary items were in the motherboard box and upon_opening the case the components were secured very well and the cable_management was brilliant .
0	i installed my os as soon as i plugged the beauty in and am typing this review in my new computer .
0	thanks dino_pc , i will reuse your service in the future and recommend you to all of my friends when they decide to upgrade !
0	as a frequent_flyer , between lhr - hkg .
0	i normally book my flight with american_express , i had to make a three booking to hong_kong to attend my grandma '_s funeral in april , flying during easter_holiday_season .
0	the flight on amex & comparison_websites were around £ 0000 -£ 0000 per person , crystal_travel managed to find me a flight with qatar_airways for £_000 .
0	i had a dedicated agent , the agent was effective and speedy dealing_with my booking , and i had a direct line i could call anytime .
0	i couldn_'_t thank_you enough for your support and i would definitely recommend this agency and make all my future booking with them .
0	i was rather ambivalent about the company as i had never_heard of however i could not resist the price difference , i made my order for wow : mists of pandaria .
0	for a great price £_00 cheaper_than blizzard and amazon asked for .
0	my product arrived on time a few_days_later without issue .
0	a little more information on their website regarding products ( pc games especially due to the requirements of some games ) could be given however i can otherwise find no issues with this company .
0	i have been liaising with ameer on a number of projects over the last six_months or so , every request was followed to the " t ".
0	when asked to call back in 0 months away , they did exactly that .
0	no pressure_selling , constructive and laid back approach is a breath of fresh_air in the modern day competitive market .
0	in fairness i was sold on the first contact but wasnt quite ready to launch , there was no pressuring and once back in touch as requested , we were up and running in no time .
0	the designer sam followed every request through without complaint and was incredibly_patient when showing me how to edit my site .
0	both really nice guys who seemed to want my business to perform well , im_glad they found me and shared their service , which is that well operated you do genuinely feel you are there only customer and they have no one else to do anything for !, as everything is responded to so quickly .
0	thanks guys , looking_forward to the next project !
0	super speedy and good value !
0	really quick friendly one million out off one million .
0	highly_recomend using this company
0	i '_ve lost_count how many issues i '_ve had with city_link .
0	their most annoying habit is their drivers that don_'_t leave a card when attempting delivery , it '_s like they expect us to be mind readers !
0	i bought an xperia play from foniacs last_week , which was featured on a deal website at a fantastic price .
0	the questions i had about the product before ordering was answered quickly by their customer_services .
0	i placed my order at 0pm , product was dispatched at 0pm , and delivered to me the next_day .
0	the best online shopping_experience i '_ve had so_far !
0	great rates and very simple online dealing platform .
0	transparant in the way they display fees and charges
0	having done my research on a couple money transfer comparison_sites including mycurrencytransfer . com i came_across fxfirm .
0	initially i was skeptical as they arent a household_name like moneycorp or currencies_direct .
0	however , the service i recieved was fabulous and saved an_absolute fortune .
0	it is well_worth shopping around for the best deal
0	they took 0 days to dispatch a special delivery ( which cost 00 pound )
0	fast and cheap
0	they dispatched my order the same day i ordered and gave_me a £_00 voucher for free .
0	i received my product the next_day and the quality is fantastic .
0	it has_been 0 years_now and we have used parcels0go regular each week .
0	we can send upto 00 parcels a week with them .
0	if i need any help they are always there on live_chat like sarah who i have just spoken to , to arrange change of address .
0	with having lot of customers our selves there are one or two parcels over the years that might get damaged or lost but as soon as i give the relevant_info i have always had a good offer on return .
0	i have used the drop and collect service and was happy ( until yodel took over ) now i am using hermes again and never had a failed collection or any_problems with them .
0	i would high recommend these and all these_people that don_'_t you must be doing something wrong .
0	again thank_you to parcels0go for a great service
0	what can i say , an excellent little company , good quality stock , friendly staff who went above and beyond to help me when i had an issue and prompt delivery .
0	if you ever need garden_furniture then head there , my bench has pride of place in my garden .
0	keep_up the good work !!
0	!
0	they let_me have an upgrade 0 months early
0	excellent company
0	absolute_rip_off !!

0	i used last_year with no_problems ,
0	so i brought a new shirt in the sale on 00 / 00 / 00
0	still_hasn_'_t come and they '_ve not answered my calls or e_- mails
0	avoid
0	i am a big_fan of pens and came_across this shop , and bought a lamy_pen , the service was quick and easy and received my pen the next_day .
0	overall great experience with this company .
0	ordered from here was the wrong item , fault was mine .
0	called them up they sorted_out problem instantly .
0	sent back using free - post provided then received correct item very next_day .
0	whole_process was perfect and fast .
0	excellent service !!!
0	!
0	very fast service sent phone received money 0 days after by far the fastest payment ive received from any mobile selling site
0	great will use again .
0	no other supplement site has the selection , service , and price that meets my needs .
0	thank_you so much sw
0	very happy with purchase , great customer service experiance and everything arrived as expected very well_packaged !
0	thanks .
0	apart_from the fact the cia is probably monitoring the whole website , it works really well !
0	it really is so easy to book through these_guys .
0	they don_'_t charge any commision ( not sure how they make their money ) but its truly simple to do , and i think it '_s only 00_% u have to pay and then u can cancel within 00_hours or something like that .
0	don_'_t know the specifics but for places like south_east asia where it '_s only $ 0 for a private room you can '_t go_wrong .
0	i have used this website many_times before , and have always found good places with it .
0	i like the rating system and the ability to order by price and rating .
0	there doesn_'_t appear to be many listings in laos , but that might have to do with the fact there are pretty_much only private_rooms and twin rooms here .
0	my order from ccl was fast , cheap and hassle_free .
0	well_worth ordering with ccl .
0	ordered a north_face gillet and it came ahead of schedule on the free delivery service and was in perfect_condition .
0	would recommend them to anyone .
0	just eat is an innovative concept that helps take_aways work better and to keep the customer satisfied , never has a take away been judge only by word of mouth , with just eat you can look at reviews of other customers and decide yourself if its worth_paying for .
0	issues can be sorted very easily by contacting the just eat team , by ordering takeaways online it solves the issue of repeating your order or address 0 times due to the lack of understanding from the take away , have no money handy , problem_solved by using your debit_card .
0	just eat has changed the away the british order take_aways , no stocking up on menu '_s , there all located in one handy site , the only recommendation i could give is just eat needs to show the takeaways food hygiene score , other than that just eat do an amazing job , they are trust_worthy , honest and outstanding , pure brilliance and idiot_proof .
0	mazuma is very fast dealing_with your order , it takes about 0 days for your pack to arrive then once its sent off next_day recorded , your money is in your account the same day it arrives if you use bank_transfer , no_problems and ive_used them 0 times , ive_used other_sites in the past and none have been this good , i would use mazuma again and again .
0	excellent customer service query answered by samantha in super quick time .
0	would def_use this service again
0	title_says it all - i would recommend red_hot sunglasses to anyone .
0	i like seo , webdesign services ..
0	nice one it related website .
0	in my life , i get best services for fireworks for sale from edinburgh fireworks store .
0	i like this .
0	excellent services for wedding fireworks . i like this .
0	they did not have the type of ram i wanted in their shop , i asked them if they could stock what i needed , and they did in around one week time .
0	great communication , product and delivery as_described .
0	absolutely excellent , they offer a really good product and i can_assure you they keep their word with the guarantees , my battery failed , i sent it back and two_days_later a brand_new battery turned_up , if i need a battery again for another car this is 000_% the place i will go !

0	they don_'_t have any advisers at all !
0	i have waited a total of 0 hours on hold .
0	is there anyone in their customer service center ?
0	company is a joke .
0	believe me the first thing i will do when i do finally get through is cancel my policy .
0	always fast and prices are so low i don_'_t bother looking elsewhere anymore .
0	great for feeding larger dogs .
0	they also only stock high_quality products which they recommend themselves .

0	every day is gold card day at supplementwarehouse . com !
0	this was my first experience with cjs_keys and i have to say , although i was a bit_sceptical at first , the experience was fantastic and i '_ll definitely be using them again .
0	they are 000_% legit , no_hidden agendas and simply an awesome service .
0	i had my key within 0 minutes of paying via_paypal and was playing the black_ops 0 within the hour .
0	with a good internet_connection to download the games buying the keys & the huge_savings is a no - brainer for your next purchase .

0	just ordered some kids headphones .
0	good site with loads of info .
0	product arrived next_day with a free_lollipop in the packaging .
0	email_updates_throughout the process .
0	would highly_recommend !
0	great site with a lot of variety and reputable brands .
0	prices are generally the lowest on the internet , even with e_- bay .
0	shipping is per order and not_necessarily per item which is nice too .
0	easy set_up , can access my documents , music , films etc , anywhere using any device .
0	brilliant piece of kit , but it did take 0 days to transfer everything over initially , but definitely worth it .
0	i decided to make the switch from halogen to led x 00 bulbs and got all the advice i needed from rob to make the right decision with no sales nonsense , very much_appreciated .
0	good service / prices , staff available on the phone to help in person
0	i bought a wowcher for a hotel stay in dumfries a few weeks_ago .
0	called the hotel to check_availability ( the day i bought it ) as i can only manage weekends and was told not to worry , as long as there are rooms i can redem my wowcher .
0	great or so i thought .
0	i called up to book on sunday with some dates we could manage .
0	there were no dates left for any weekend despite me being told that there was plenty of availability if i wanted to book at the full rack rate as they were only accepting 00 wowchers a day .
0	?. i was not told this the first time .
0	i contacted wowcher as now that 00 days have past i '_m going to lose £_00 due to me only being allowed to claim 00_% as a credit and not the full_amount .
0	ive heard_nothing back from them .
0	looking at this site by the looks of it not responding is the norm for them .
0	a gutted girlfriend as this was for her_birthday which is now no use but yet wowcher is not willing to help in anyway ... says a lot really !
0	!
0	the product was very cheap for the services it provides and when i called student_computers , instead of flogging off their more_expensive items , they directed me towards this cheaper version which actually was better in performance .
0	the delivery was extremely quick , seeing as i paid nothing for it .
0	all in all i think this company and product was a brilliant find .
0	just got a dell_d000 from val_u computers and had great service .
0	the laptop is in great condition and seems to be all in working order and as stated .
0	great company to deal with and will be ordering again soon for a second laptop for son .
0	i get a lot of packages from dhl and it ’_s only gone_wrong once .
0	but it went really wrong !
0	i rarely need proper next_day delivery but as luck would have it ; that ’_s the one that went sour .
0	i needed something urgent for the weekend and it was thursday , so i called the vendor and he assured me it would be sent out strait_away .
0	friday came and went and .
0	nothing .
0	i called dhl , which was a real hassle ( they have no uk customer service number , so i ended_up dialling ‘ international sales ’ and asked them to put me through ), they said that i wasn_’_t in , which i was , and they need the number off the card to rearrange delivery , i had no card .
0	anyway after a huge ordeal i got it re - delivered on the monday , no good to me at all ; and never got any kind of refund on the service !
0	crap .
0	but that ’_s one bad_experience nestled in amongst a great many good ones !
0	very fast delivery service , the staff are also incredibly helpful and knowledgeable .
0	made the order for collection , realised our printer didn_'_t work , contacting the company via the livehelp , and was assisted extremely quickly by jessica ( which , apparently is her real name ), who sorted everything out for us in around a minute !
0	i travel 0 - 0 time per_month ... and i always use hostelbookers to find my hostels ....
0	i also used hostel_world .. hostelclub .. booking . com etc ... but i for me hostelbookers :.
0	is the best .
0	i never payed any booking_fee whit hostel_bookers .. i also found hostels more cheap here than in other website .. so this is good ..
0	the reviews are always uploaded .. i remember i had some question about a hostel .. so i wrote to hostel_bookers staff and they answered me in a shot time .. they was really nice ..
0	i will always use hostelbookers ... simply the best ... also nice a easy to use their website .. fabio orlando
0	i simply cannot_fault the service provided .
0	top_draw .
0	talktalk is hands_down the most difficult company i ’ ve ever had the displeasure of dealing_with .
0	they rope you in with great prices , but expect to get what you pay for when things go_wrong .
0	the on - hold times are horrendous , and the staff treat you like idiots , with no real enthusiasm for problem_solving .
0	- one thing i have learned , if you want anything sorted , immediately refuse to deal with the person you are talking to and request a manager , they can actually be a little more helpful .
0	my issues arised when i moved home and was forced to sign a new 00 month_contract to continue the service .
0	either that or to buy myself out of the contract ….
0	including a £_000 bill for the youview_box .
0	no chance .
0	so we continued with the home move , all should be well and good ?!
0	except 0_weeks after the ‘ go live ’ date , we still had no service .
0	it must have taken 0 phone_calls and over 0 hours of my time just to persuade them to send an engineer out .
0	there is only so many_times your intelligence can be insulted .
0	“ have you tried switching the router on and off again ” jesus man , i ’_m not an imbecile , of course i ’ ve tried that - and many of the other useless troubleshooting exercises on your website .
0	so lots of hassle later , 0 talktalk engineers later ( 0 never turned_up which we are being charged for – whole other story ) and 0 bt_engineer later …… 0_weeks have passed – we have internet and phone !
0	huzzah !
0	of course , the talktalk rules are i must pay my bill regardless if i ’_m receiving a service , or they won_’_t fix the line because of an outstanding_balance in arrears .
0	reassured on a number occasions i could claim compensation for the loss of service , i continued to pay for a service i wasn_’_t receiving .
0	so naturally , i called talktalk again , explained i ’ ve had no service for 0_weeks and am requesting compensation .
0	“ not a problem ” they say , “ we can offer you …… urmmm , the computer system says , erm ….. £ 0 . 00 ” you can_imagine my response .
0	“ five pounds and fifty pence ?!
0	you mean £_00 ?
0	is that a joke ?!
0	use some logic man , i pay £_00 . 00 a month , i ’ ve had 0_weeks of no service , how you can offer me £ 0 . 00 ?
0	to date , we are on phone_call number 0 , another 0 hours of my time , going round and round in circles .
0	the most_recent offer was £_00 …......… an_absolute insult .
0	i '_ll keep phoning and get angrier and angrier until something is sorted .
0	:)
0	and a quick message to mary , we have written on the facebook_page explaining the troublesome service we '_ve had , and your response was to delete it .
0	cheers then , you pirates .
0	the guys were very helpful .
0	thanks
0	i ordered some bouquets on mothers_day itself and requested them by phone to do same day delivery .
0	they promised they would try and they did deliver .
0	m happy !
0	!
0	i had to go to india in 0 days and on a request , they sent my package in special delivery without_any extra_charges .
0	the package was with me within 0 hrs of ordering .
0	this is how service should be .
0	special thanks to ms . gill .
0	these_guys are great , i '_ve been buying stuff from them for a few_years_now and never had any problem .. really first mail order ..
0	i had my tickets at a very good price and they were very quick with booking and delivery which made me very happy and a satisfied customer !
0	i would definatly recommend people to use this company !
0	nice feature on the left , scrolling_through price range .
0	fantastic - would defo recommend .
0	very cheap and reliable
0	such a cheap and easy wine that they don_'_t even tell you the grape its made with ( i think its nero d ' avola but i couldn_'_t swear to it ) but this is one of the nicest wines i have had in ages .
0	absolutely_gorgeous and it '_s really really cheap too .
0	full_marks from me !
0	this was so cheap , i was really pleased with the price and my order came almost_immediately .
0	generally very happy , i will be definitely using them again .
0	this is an amazing store can pretty_much get anything from here the communication is good and have helped_me out with parts a few time
0	such a fantastic store if you need anything from camping to airsoft or some hard_wearing boots this is the place to go . and the delivery options are outstanding . the customer service is fast and reliable .
0	walking into ss00 is like walking into a heaven made as it should be .
0	there ain '_t no wings and angels , but there are boards and dudes .
0	the staff are like family , and make you feel like part of that family .
0	yeah , i quite like the place .
0	a brilliant bunch of highly focused seo experts with a real go and achieve it attitude ..
0	this company will go places
0	... say '_s it all really
0	order was perfect , delivered on time and correctly .
0	n0
0	nothing bad to say about this purchase both codes were delivered instantly and both worked_perfectly .
0	great service at an amazing price !
0	i literally can '_t complain_about the service scan have provided for me , ( admittedly i do not have the misfortune to need to return or rma anything ).
0	the order was picked , packed , and shipped within 0 mins of paying for the sa000 and arrived between the arranged 0 hour time_slot_allocated to me by dpd .
0	i also received update emails upon_completion of each of the steps as well as one to inform_me of the allocated slot .
0	all in all this was a very pleasant , informative , and event free transaction , one that id be more than happy to repeat .
0	the website in general is very helpful , and has the most useful_feature of any hostel website i '_ve_used .
0	the tags at the side detailing facilities is perfect to glance over at , and the layout is informative and logical , if a little cramped .
0	making the actual booking was extremely quick , and i didn_'_t have to go through 00 different pages worth of forms , just a pop - up box where i put in the payment basics and then done !
0	booked !
0	confirmation page pops_up and email is sent out .
0	just in terms of constructive_criticism , the website itself is sized quite small , leaving a huge_amount of white space on the right hand size of the screen ( on all pcs i '_ve visited it on ), and also it would be helpful if the actual hostel '_s contact details were clearly on display on their respective pages .
0	overall easy and efficient experience , would recommend .
0	chris is a brilliant bloke , told_him what was wrong with my console and he knew_exactly_what needed to be done .
0	his prices are very good aswell for what you get .
0	in 0 hour he fixed , tested , serviced and cleaned my ps0 .
0	gave_me a call when it was all done .
0	you also get 0 months guarantee on the repair .
0	friendly guy , honest and genuine .
0	i would use him again and have recommended him already to family and friends who are going to contact him very soon .
0	keep_up the good work chris and thanks for help .
0	omar
0	the book is really nice but i wasn_'_t impressed with the quality of the photos in the photobook .
0	i have the same photos done in a photobook from photobox and the quality from them was brilliant , no pixels at all .
0	for that reason i wont be using again or recommending as it has put me off .
0	regards
0	best game our there and it is legit and it can be tasky game but it is very very good at trying new stuff out you can even pay for your sub with virtual money and its a great game to get addicted to now like wow
0	0_star
0	its alright but i wouid use amazon as they are more reliable and legit
0	best place if you want to go somewhere any other can fuck off
0	its ok but i wouid just shop for it
0	best shipping company out there they get it in the next_day if your lucky :)
0	very good flights fast and cheap this service is advised especially going to gran_canaria
0	very good place to harbour electronic_equipment it has it all tv '_s game consoles wireing for computers and are cheap you can buy dvd_players blueray and all_sorts
0	i got my graphics_card then suddenly i realised it was water_cooled the engineer and me parent was there and we never installed it we took it back 00 £ for delivery back they told us it was fried and already used we didnt use it for a second it was in a diffrent box aswell a 000 this one was 000 gtx when it got took back we had already used another one a gtx_000 this one isnt working either and they are not even refunding the water_cooled one and say we used it they even said they sent us an email but that was a trick to keep us occupied these are not eligible i wouid highly not reccomend this service at all !
0	ordered the last two flight cases from this company and the service has_been fantastic .
0	my first flight case was for a marshall jam 000 , delivered in good time and excellent build quality .
0	when i upgraded my head i returned to this company for a second time but have had some problems with the measurements due to the manufacturers of my amp not providing the correct ones .
0	as i measured the head myself , i made a couple of mistakes , and have had to return the case a couple of times .
0	however , the guys here have really helped_me with this and have been very patient and have resolved this problem for me .
0	awesome work guys i '_ll be shopping here again for sure !
0	great weekend , no issues , no faults , outstanding !
0	it pays you significantly more than any other company , and it '_s simple , easy , and free to post your old_phones .
0	never had a problem and quick payment too !
0	would definitely recommend .
0	onlinekeystore is simply the best online store with great prices , great games and great service .
0	don_'_t go_elsewhere they have everything you need !
0	had no_problems booking , everything_went fine and quickly .
0	website is easy to understand and has very quick loading times .
0	recommended !
0	i made a bit of a mistake , i admit .
0	i was too trusting and sent money via bank_transfer to a seller who sent me some acoustic foam which smelt so bad i had to throw it away .
0	stale cigarettes and a build up of tar all over it .
0	cost £_00 .
0	the seller pretended to refund the money , but after a month , i '_ve given up .
0	my advice : be careful of people selling acoustic foam , and see it in person before buying .
0	if you cannot , do not use gumtree to purchase .
0	you may as well burn money .
0	i contacted gumtree support who sent a standard email back .
0	they couldn_'_t even be_bothered to customise the email !
0	where the item name should be , there was just an " xxxxx " placeholder .
0	i did complain directly to them about this , for which they apologised .
0	i asked them to remove the advert for the remaining foam , as i thought it was unfair for others to suffer loss .
0	they refused .
0	utterly_disgusted with this service .
0	gumtree , i will not be using you again .
0	worst experience online ever !
0	i purchased an se gemini iii from production_room , and i had an excellent experience .
0	i spoke to a great guy on the phone , whose_name escapes me , unfortunately .
0	he sourced the mic , contacted me the next_day with an expected arrival and delivery date , and offered me a good deal .
0	in addition to this , they keep me informed of special_offers - and exclusive ones too .
0	i ordered an xlr cable which was out of stock , and they called me within an_hour or so to tell me they weren_'_t getting any for a while , which gave_me the opportunity to purchase elsewhere .
0	i cannot_fault them and i hope they continue to provide an excellent service .
0	invitations are gorgeous we are both more than happy with them .
0	would recommend them to anyone .
0	thank_you very much
0	great service from currency_uk
0	very impressed .
0	if in doubt dont be , to me it was a weird concept but it worked out great !
0	i bought £_000 worth of meats from here as my first purchase , got to say i was amazed_how quick my order turned_up .
0	unfortunately due to rough handed couriers the box has exploded on one side and had a hole in one corner where it had been scraped across the floor .
0	luckily it was still ice_cold though !
0	i noticed 0 packs of meatballs had went brown due to this so gave musclefood a call .
0	issue resolved straight_away , refund issued , i only rang to get mf to have a word with the courier .
0	best customer service team ever !
0	the quality of the meat is unbelievable
0	mince is so dense it feels_like a steak , never felt anything like it !
0	cooks amazing with literally no fat drip too .
0	chicken_breasts are huge , most of them being 000 - 000g !
0	this is going to be my place to get my monthly shop from now on , highly impressed !!
0	if only they sold vegetables ??
0	haha .
0	cheap and fast
0	great selection , the price match worked instantly , and a lot of free options and samples .
0	overall a great experience and i will be coming_back for sure with all of my supplement_needs .
0	ordered a new strap for my suunto watch .
0	wasn_'_t sure what the measurements were so they took the time to go and measure one and call me back with their impressions etc .
0	item arrived the day after i ordered them .
0	cant_ask for more than that !!!
0	thank_you !
0	so easy to use for first time users that want to start there business and grow .
0	very helpful and any_problems are delt_with straight_away i '_ll be using 000 for the next 0_yrs as my business is growing and ill be using them in the future as ive not had any issue with them and ive already_recommended them to my growing team as my businees is all about recommending ( saving money )
0	i was very glad with your product am for the delivery it was quicker and for the prices you need to do more promotion offer
0	i ordered on 00 / 00 /_0000 - they cancelled order cos not able to do the same ,
0	they try to transfer the money to my card due to card expiry they are not able to do the same .
0	after i requested and fight with them , they accepted to transfer the money to my bank .
0	almost 0 months over still not they are not transferred to bank .
0	i '_ve ordered a fair few things from ebuyer and never had any_problems .
0	the site is easy to use and prices seem good .
0	after a mildly frightening conversation with a friendly carpenter regarding the potential cost of solid_oak_worktops , i found worktop_express online .
0	i was very pleased with their prices , and it turns_out their worktops are very nice .
0	i was a bit_sceptical after_reading several reviews online about these cash for phones companys , and although mazuma didnt offer the best price (£_00 - mazuma , the highest being £_000 ), they had the best reviews .
0	people were claiming to have been ripped_off by the companys offering more money saying they had recieved damaged phones , and giving out a fraction of the advertised price .
0	after choosing mazuma i emailed them to inform them my keypad surround was missing and one corner of the phone was dented , and would this still qualify for the full_amount , which they said it would .
0	( i kept the email incase of any_issues down the line , i then sent my phone with royal_mail , insured for free up to 00 pounds as_described in mazumas directions , and after 0 days received a confirmation_email , and the money straight into my bank_account :).
0	will_definitely use mazuma again , and have no quams recoomending them to others !
0	we ended_up using the best reviewed / cheapest surveyor from the list given to us from comparemymove and we are really happy with the result .
0	i ordered the new iwc pilots watch from iconic_watches two_weeks_ago and it arrived today as promised .
0	the correspondence i had with everyone at iconic_watches was 0st_class and the price i paid was definitely the cheapest i had seen both in shops and on the internet .
0	the next watch i buy will 000_% be from iconic_watches .
0	well its a very awsome thing you guys got going on here , pay two pounds and get a random key i like it alot , its a shame i already got a key that i own !
0	excelent job , i have got my iphone_unlock in less_than a day !!.
0	finally i have phone again after more than 0 months as an ipod .
0	thank_you very much !
0	cjs_cd_keys is a great service that i cannot and i mean cannot recommend highly_enough i have been using the service for around a year now .
0	and it hasn_'_t disappointed me once .
0	the few_times i '_ve contacted support my issues have been dealt_with in a professional_manner in a timely_fashion .
0	00 / 00 service , always cheaper_than the rest .
0	competetive_pricing and regular special_offers , plus a good loyalty_scheme .
0	i normally select ' free delivery ' and usually have the goods in a couple of days .
0	when i '_ve_used the next_day service the goods have always arrived on time .
0	goods are always well_packaged .
0	site is easy to navigate by category or brand or by using the search_function and there is plenty of revelant information for each product .
0	i would like to see more customer reviews of the products but that is down to the site users and not the company ( i haven_'_t reviewed any of the products myself so shouldn_'_t complain ).
0	highly_recommended .
0	i could easily browse through the website .
0	the site interface is clean and easily_understood for first time user like me .
0	the booking page is also simple , the numbers are clearly_shown and confirmation is received in the matter of minutes .
0	highly_recommended .
0	simply the best and better_than all the rest supplementwarehouse .
0	their low_prices are unmatched especially with there low price match selection and quality first_rate shipping .
0	sw is top of the line in customer service , product selection , and discounts .
0	they are made to please the health and fitness supplement consumer .
0	0 of my recent orders with online companies were delivered by hermes .
0	of those , three were delivered to the wrong_address and three of them were not delivered at all and one took three_weeks to be delivered .
0	the three that weren_'_t delivered were supposedly left in a safe location , the communal_hallway of my building by the front_door .
0	obviously these three parcels went missing as a communal_hallway is hardly a safe_place .
0	that '_s if they were actually delivered in the first place as for all know the courier stole them .
0	no cards were left through the door so there '_s no proof the courier even left the parcels .
0	i '_ve actually had a full blown argument with one of their self_employed couriers before after he threatened and swore at me on the phone .
0	hermes seem to use self_employed couriers and would apparently not require any experience , skill or professionalism from them .
0	hermes won_'_t allow you to contact them by phone or email to complain personally and they say ' contractual_obligations ' are the reason , although i '_ve spoken to some of the companies who use them and it '_s hermes insistence that they are not to be contacted directly by the person receiving the parcel .
0	they really are utterly rubbish and incompetent .
0	too quality firm .
0	love that questions are answered quickly whether you call or email .
0	the staff know what they ' re_talking_about as well , which is always helpful .
0	good prices , not the cheapest , most stuff can be found cheaper on ebay or amazon but comes without the customer_services .
0	i tried to buy a key from another site on - line but they wanted photo identity
0	so after about 0 hours of all this conformation stuff i gave up ,
0	and found cjs_keys i got my key within 00_minutes and could play in 00 ,
0	your site is amazing i will be back
0	this is one of the best digital software sites around .
0	the quick and easy nature of the purchase was unprecedented .
0	it seemed safe , and i urge_anyone who is after a bargain for items like microsoft_points , playstation_plus subscriptions and more , to look no further then here .
0	basically they are not the ones that do the delivery , they arrange it for you !
0	they are the middle_man !
0	unfortunately they are not very good at it and they don_'_t really have much control of whats_happening !
0	their customer service is a complete nonsense !
0	the team comes across incompetent and incapable to assist particularly with international_deliveries !
0	i '_m not gonna go into details but if you have a choice go for another service !
0	and never ever ever choose parcelforce to deliver anything under no circumstances !
0	this is my 0nd order with tile empire .
0	i was very happy with the service and notifications i got from tile empire and the metro black tiles i needed to fit with the deco .
0	their website was easy to follow and delivery was prompt and with no issues .
0	would use them again .
0	needed some advice ordering a pushchair .
0	gentlemen on the phone was unbelievably helpful , and extremely patient , even_though i took a lot of his time seeking advise :) :).
0	eventually ordered item on monday , it arrived tuesday_morning , sms in the morning of delivery .
0	cannot be_faulted .
0	keep_up the good work .
0	wanted to sign up to the exchange for some , found the starting_point easy enough and took me through the steps needed to start betting with an intro video for new beginners
0	knocks socks off others
0	i cannot_praise their service enough .
0	they always deliver the best service for their customers , offer the best prices and are quick to help with any_issues .
0	always happy to use shopto . net , they offer their services with the gamer in mind .
0	hostelbookers is my first choice when it comes to picking hostels .
0	i '_m quite the novice at this , but after a few go '_s on the website , i have no issues booking_hostels .
0	the website is just set out in a simple , yet beautiful fashion , and is incredibly efficient in getting you what you want .
0	booking your hostel of choice is very simple and can be done in a few_clicks .
0	comparing ratings between hostels , reading past reviews and in particular , the great variety of hostels offered is amazing and efficient .
0	top that experience off with very affordable rates and it '_s a winner .
0	i '_ve booked all my hostels via this site and i don_'_t regret it for a second .
0	i highly_recommend using this for any traveller .
0	really impressed with healthy_supplies .
0	unfortunately one of the items i received in my 0nd order was damaged ( most_likely happened in transit ) but was replaced immediately as soon as i flagged it up , will_definitely be using hs again , thanks !
0	easy to use website , constant_communication_regarding dispatch ( even allowed_me to change they day it was delivered via_text ), extremely satisfied with customer service and product .
0	dont watch much tv but when i do i just end up turning it off after 0 mins of adverts is stuck in your face 0 seconds after you turn something on .
0	always left a card for attempted delivery !
0	maybe knock a little louder as i was 00ft from the door and a card appears i didnt hear ?...
0	also the drivers i have dealt_with can be rude and abrupt .
0	bad_experience and service .
0	we switched to talktalk a month_ago because of the huge bills from bt .
0	when i rang talktalk about switching i was only after phone and broadband as we are happy with sky_tv , but was talked into the tv package too as it was cheaper .
0	anyway ... 0_weeks_later we have recieved the tv box ( that we didnt really want ) but the router ( that we needed ) is still not here .
0	then 0 days ago they cut the phone line off without_any warning .
0	phoned up to pay the bill and was told it would be back on within 00_hours , well 00_hours_later its still not on !
0	after just a month we are done with this second rate company .
0	i usually use fedex but on this occasion had to opt for parcelforce .
0	after_seeing the reviews on here ( trustpilot ) i got a little_worried but there was no need !
0	i use fedex because they are always on time and get my parcels delivered safely before 0pm .
0	parcelforce delivered at 0 : 00 with 0 % damage / creases to the packing , so i rate them very good on this experience :)
0	felt really strongly about recent issues with my internet and phone provider ( bt ).
0	so i decided to write a review , my first ever on trustpilot .
0	i kept composed and even edited out anything that could be termed course or offensive at all before posting my review only for it to instantly disappear and say it was reported for bad language .
0	so i read through it a couple of times on the edit screen to make_sure there was no bad language or anything offensive at all .
0	i thought maybe it was standard procedure to check the reviews .
0	so i waited 0 days then checked when i was next online ... and still no review .
0	so i message trustpilot and ask if they actually bother checking reviews ?
0	yes within 0 days was there reply .
0	low and behold on day 0 the review i took 00_mins to compose and type was gone .
0	or should i say never checked and / or published when it was perfectly fine .
0	what '_s the point trustpilot ?
0	i suggest you do some work and less time at the coffee_machine .
0	my mums migration to plusnet went wrong due to openreach but plusnet were next to useless getting it resolved and ended_up taking a week .
0	meanwhile someone_else had been given our number and we had someone_elses .
0	took so long to resolve as plusnet admitted they raised an incorrect fault as they didn_'_t know what else to do !
0	this caused my pensioner mum lots of stress .
0	trying to get things corrected was very difficult and involved many calls and having to be quite forceful which should be unnecessary .
0	dealing_with the complaints_department was extremely disappointing and just exacerbated the bad_experience .
0	at first they put the complaint on the wrong account , they lied at one point , they did not read correspondence properly and they did not take a probable data_protection breach seriously .
0	at the end they issued a deadlock code and inferred we were just after money when they didn_'_t offer much and we know they offered more to someone for the same problem that only lasted a day !
0	their cheap package also doesn_'_t work out that cheap if you get caught for not included calls and extra broadband .
0	will leave asap .
0	update_: complained to cisas and awarded full compensation requested .
0	note that plusnet have increased some prices but you cannot leave without_penalty if you had their ' free ' connection and router within 00 months .
0	i think a dis_- honest way of keeping customers trapped when raising prices !
0	i recently_purchased my daughter a vetech inotab from the funky rabbit online store late on a sunday_evening and was able to reserve and pick_up in store first thing in the monday_morning !
0	ideal for anyone who '_s on the run and if not a very affordable delivery option was also available , a fantastic personal service instore as always !
0	happy customer !
0	happy daughter !!
0	!
0	i have been consistently impressed with urban_industry after using them for the last few_years .
0	great website , always have fresh stock , good sales , fast / reliable delivery , good customer service & friendly on the phone .
0	i finally feel_compelled to review as they just processed a stress_free - refund on a faulty item very quickly .
0	big up urban_industry
0	as i had a fair few questions_regarding the products i sent out emails to snorestore which were promptly replied to .
0	no automated replies , just proper answers .
0	so i was very happy to order from them .
0	within 0 days ( first_class post ) the item was here and it could not have gone any smoother even during such a busy_period in london .
0	supplementwarehouse . com is always my first and last place for supplement shopping .
0	always has the lowest_prices and if i can find a cheaper price not only will they match it , they will beat plus they have a huge_selection to choose from .
0	there '_s no other place i ' d rather order from .
0	accommodation was not stag_doo friendly and showers were terrible !
0	bar_crawl that was apparently a party pass was not even heard of in any of the bars on the list so a waste of time .
0	" guestlist entry to chy bar " no guest_list as it was free entry to everyone anyway .
0	quad_biking and clay_pigeon shooting were excellent but we still feel after asking around we could of organised the whole_thing for cheaper but thanks anyway chillisauce .
0	ordered a berghaus cornice ii jacket and fleece in december_0000 , and another order january_0000 for second fleece , both delivered promptly .
0	a year later i noticed excessive_wear on the jacket around the waist draw - cord .
0	emailed support at outdoorkit at noon on a sunday who responded within fifteen_minutes advising me to return the jacket .
0	they replaced it with a brand_new jacket , same model , size and colour free of charge !
0	it only cost me to post back the original jacket .
0	absolutely_brilliant , and wholeheartedly recommended .
0	waiting for a parcel on a 0 - 0 day delivery - a birthday_present for my son .
0	after 0 days their site said parcel was delivered but i hadn_'_t received it .
0	their website has no contact number on it but i managed to track one down and phoned up .
0	they refused to give me any info " because i wasn_'_t the sender " but they would " raise a query " with the courier and i might hear in 00_hours .
0	the next_day still nothing and after numerous phone_calls to some very unhelpful people someone eventually told me " oh it hasn_'_t even been collected yet , it '_s been a tracking error ".
0	what ?
0	so you would think they would rush over and collect it and express delivery it on a 00 hour service .
0	but oh no - it '_ll just be 0 - 0 days from when it gets collected .
0	seriously ?
0	what a complete_joke .
0	and why don_'_t they have their number on their website ?
0	" because we ' re a web based company ."
0	no , you ' re a human_being sitting in a physical office working for a company that has a website that doesn_'_t bother to give customers their phone number .
0	you ' re not a web based company - just a company hiding_behind a website .
0	then these are the place online to shop , have had 0 different batteries from them now over a few_years , no issues , no_complains , and always a good price , tip_: join there facebook group for a small discount_code ;)
0	very surprised how fast my order was delivered .
0	this company came highly_recommended and did not disappoint .
0	i will_definitely be using their services again .
0	t - shirt what i wanted , great communication , fast delivery , will_defo_use again !
0	!
0	best bookie ever !!!
0	!
0	great selection , service and price .
0	free next_day delivery and tracking service with lots of discounts via newsletter !
0	set the standard for online purchasing !
0	ive spent no less_than $_000 every couple months on supplements over the course of the past 00 years .
0	i '_m not gonna do the math on that because ill feel bad about it , but hey its a habit im not gonna break anytime_soon and im staying in shape .
0	bottom_line , i wish i knew about sw before now because 0 . they match prices ( with a simple reference site and price ) 0 . more of what im looking for so i dont have to go 0 - 0 places 0 . freebies that are coming out my , well you get the point !
0	shipping is very reasonable especially since the freebies and discounts surpass that amount .
0	its really a no_brainer , as long as my order shows up within a week then my loyalties are shifting to supplement_warehouse .
0	very nice and helpful on the phone , cheapest price i could_find , and delivered the next_day having ordered at 0pm the previous .
0	ace !
0	very good service , the parcel was well_packaged and it was not damaged at all , and even_though the product was from_hong_kong it was a very quick delivery .
0	excellent !!!!
0	!
0	arrived in 0 days , sent first_class .
0	good quality , smells great and my vanilla ice_cream tastes great !
0	so much_cheaper_than the supermarkets !
0	arranged service over the phone , quick response and perfect time and date .
0	on the day of visit , arrived at the time stated and also was completed in a speed time .
0	would highly_reccomend
0	great price from buysend and competitive with other online_retailer .
0	delivery was quick and delivered on time .
0	the product was exactly_what i was expecting and made my purchase very easy .
0	would use this company again and again .
0	had a few questions about using some of the international services and emma found local information on the carrier in greece quickly and efficiently .
0	because of her service i will use parcel0go .
0	booked online , was the cheapest to use and was right next to gatwick_south_terminal .
0	bus left almost as soon as i parked and there were others waiting behind it and on return i only had to wait for 0 minutes at the terminal for it .
0	at the gate my ticket was recognized nad was quickly on my way .
0	will_definitely use again in the future !
0	bought the game and within 0 minutes it had been delivered .
0	i will_definitely be using these_guys again
0	really the only place i go anymore .
0	good prices , match a competitors and free stuff .
0	not much else to say but try it yourself .
0	as above ordered on the monday_morning and had the game by tuesday tea time ( i just used the royal_mail free service ) hitman for 00 pounds bargain as its 00 everywhere_else .
0	will use again
0	easy , no booking_fee , fast , and friendly - that '_s why i use hostelbookers for already more than 0 years from now .
0	this is by far the best experience i have had from a courier when rebooking collection .
0	thank_you parcel to go and especially sammie_taylor
0	i used to go to different online stores for all different things depending on what i was doing and which had their own specified store brands .
0	i quickly learned that even for name brands , supplementwarehouse will outcompete other_websites ' off brands in price .
0	it makes it easier and more trusted this way and i wouldn_'_t go with another company !
0	best price i could_find anywhere and fast free delivery !!
0	couldn_'_t ask for anymore .
0	top_notch place to buy always pleased with the speed of my orders would recommend you to try it today
0	fast delivery , easy website , good selection , great prices .
0	what more could you want ?
0	the site is well_laid_out and includes a variety options when choosing a place to stay .
0	their information was up - to - date and detailed .
0	good ill bay again
0	i have been ordering from these_guys for about 0 years_now and i cant really say much else but they are very good .
0	they beat any other competitors price on the spot and the shipping is unbeatable .
0	thanks .
0	a really helpful company who deliver well_packaged , timely , quality products .
0	shocking .
0	they claim any enquiries will be answered within 00_hrs .
0	after my third enquiry , a week after my original enquiry , i received a completely_unhelpful reply , telling_me to call their number instead , which no doubt will cost .
0	my experience is obviously tiny and unimportant compared to those whose tickets are cancelled , replaced etc , but i think it '_s very symptomatic of how this company runs and treats its customers .
0	avoid .
0	nothing to say , really .
0	it is really great and cheap for visiing .
0	just one flaw , you must travel off peak , which is really not convenient .
0	i have always bought my supplements from dolphin_fitness , before when i used to buy maximuscle products , now that i have switched to reflex products and even in recommended to a friend that was looking for bsn syntha - 0 ; on all cases they are the cheapest on the net .
0	would like to see them stock schiek training accessories , but that bears no reflection the speedy and satisfactory service .
0	great price and fast delivery
0	great free service and lots of paid help if needed .
0	will_definitely use again .
0	the 0 of us travelling to turkey had an awful experience with travelup .
0	they incorrectly booked one of our flights despite it being right on our e_- ticket .
0	also after noticing on our e_- ticket that they hadn_'_t booked us baggage , we rang up to enquire .
0	they told us that it was a mistake and that we did have luggage included .
0	this was a lie which ended_up causing us a lot of hassle and costing_£_00 .
0	they were rude and unresponsive when we complained to them .
0	there '_s a great service called flubit which gets better deals on products , which are already at competitive_prices .
0	what '_s more you are not committed to buying once they have quoted a price so it essentially works as an exclusive deal service for the exact products you want .
0	as well as the competitive_prices the quality of the produce is always better_than the supermarket .
0	the selection of products are fantastic and all for a great price .
0	the only thing i would change is to put montgomery cherry extract on the list of products .
0	the delivery is always quick and free which is always good .
0	i ordered my no explode on 0nd_january and it got to my door at 00 ; 00 today .
0	i will be ordering from this company again and would recommend the to anyone .
0	hi after purchasing from savewatersavemoney i found it nice and smooth to use and the mobile site has_been designed well too it was easy to show my girlfriend future_purchases whilst out and about and we now have a good selection for our new property in the summer
0	excellent fast service from_hong_kong , wow perfect time for christmas will shop with again
0	title explains it all , i '_m really happy with the fast service and good offers they have :)
0	great service and quick payment , emails to keep me updated and free delivery print off slip to send phone .
0	perfect
0	ordered a product online with no store near - by , the product then became_faulty after 0 months , i used my order number to view the order online and it had an option to return and book a courier , i did this and no courier came , so i booked another day and no courier came .
0	i rang up and they said that service is only for the first 00 days and go to a store .
0	i told them i had no stores near by and there system gave_me the impression the courier was coming .
0	at no point did they admit there website was in the wrong , letting you book a collection after 00 days .
0	really really bad service but in the end after insisting i was right , they refunded me .
0	i ordered a petite star njoy bubble grey / black * reworked * a , this was a grade ( a ) pushchair and the website states grade a pushchairs are : returned items that are as ' new ' and un - used .
0	when the item arrived it looked perfect , we had a good inspection as the website said : reworked prams and pushchairs are sold without warranty , under distance_selling_regulations you have 0 days to return the item to us if you are unhappy for the goods in any way .
0	we noticed the hood catch was faulty so i rang nursery value up and explained the issue and they said to send it back and we ’ ll repair it , i stated we would have no buggy in this time and can ’_t they send another pushchair to us and collect this one , as it would be quicker but they insisted on collecting and repairing the pushchair and said i ’ d have it back next week .
0	i really wasn_'_t happy with this as the distance_selling_regulations said i was entitled to a refund and they could have just exchanged it .
0	a long time past and i had no updates at all about my repair , i thought i would have had an update when they received it then when it went in to be repaired and so on .
0	but i was totally in the dark about what was happening .
0	so i called them and they said they haven ’_t even looked at it yet but they will soon and get it out the week after , i was totally unhappy with this as we at this point have been carrying our 0 month old baby around .
0	so i stated i needed the pram asap and stated i was told i would have it this week and explained i had 0 days to cancel the transaction and said if the service is this bad please_accept my request to cancel , they then agreed to refund me i did actually receive the refund within 0 days but was shocked when they said : refunds can take up to 00 days but we aim to have these done with 0 - 00 working_days .
0	they then said : we do hope that this experience hasn_'_t put you off purchasing from us again .
0	so i said it hasn_'_t as i like the pram and may buy one from a retail store .
0	but you ’ re never going to believe what they said next , remember the item came to me faulty .
0	“ when we collect items for refunds we do need to minus £_00 from the refund for carriage cost , with this being a reworked item we generally would have charged £_00 for carriage as this comes with no guarantee for the repair .”
0	yes they wanted to charge me £_00 carriage for their faulty item , i reminded them about the long_distance_selling_regulations , the law , trading_standards and their reputation .
0	they then said they would refund me in full .
0	so in short their pushchairs do look really good and are good quality but if you have a problem that ’_s when the issues start , i just want people to beware and know your rights .
0	i want the manager of the company to read this and ensure that their staff are retrained and updated on selling_regulations , as you have good pushchairs but really really really bad aftercare and this can massively affect your business .
0	i hope this review has helped some people .
0	if they would have offered better service i would have gave these 0 / 0 .
0	one of the best for me to buy anything u want .
0	i giving 0_stars
0	i have been ordering red_wine cases about 0 times now and every time the quality of the wines get worse and worse .
0	granted , they are all extremely young wines and pretty_much taste like vinegar next_day , but they are generally dull and tasteless - i wouldn_'_t even recommend them to the casual wine drinker .
0	the delivery was always next_day , but on my last order the courier did not follow_instructions to leave it with my neighbour next door - i had to inconvenience someone across the road whom i did not know .
0	today a guy rang me and wanted to sell me a new piggybank - type system , apparently unlike any of those typical ' wine plans ' with plenty of benefits and discounts .
0	it sounded alright on the phone and asked to be emailed the details in writing so i could have a look and then decide .
0	moments_later i receive two emails congratulating me on signing_up to this new fantastic service !
0	i had to sign into my account and cancel it manually , where i was faced with the most outrageous and miserable cancellation process i '_ve seen in my entire life - involving ticking several check boxes etc .
0	it was absolutely_ridiculous .
0	this is a warning to anybody_wanting cheap wine over the internet : stay_away from naked_wines !
0	try laithwaites wines instead , for instance , i '_ve only had very positive_experience with them .
0	having bought a voucher for sunglasses_shop (£_00 for £_00 to spend ), i first looked offline to find and try on a selection of sunglasses .
0	going back to the website , finding those sunglasses was super easy and they had everything i saw in the shop .
0	the order process was very straightforward and delivery extremely speedy , with safe packaging .
0	i would highly_recommend this shop for anybody who prefers to ' look offline , buy online '.
0	placed order on 00 / 00 /_0000 worth £_00 . 00 .
0	on 00 / 00 /_0000 i wrote :
0	" could you please advise when this order will be dispatched ."
0	on 00 / 00 /_0000 seller replied :
0	" our dispatch team said that they will be shipping out tomorrow ."
0	as of 00 / 00 /_0000 i have not received either dispatch_notification or the item itself .
0	therefore i conclude that this company is involved in fraudulent_activity and a scam .
0	escalated dispute to claim on paypal .
0	i '_m a regular customer at red_hot sunglasses and they have never once let_me down .
0	in comparison to competitors their range is 0nd to none , the pricing is always the most competitive and most_importantly the service is spot on .
0	having had poor experiences with online_retailers in the past , these_guys really know their stuff and are on top of their game .
0	highly_recommend .
0	flies from heathrow , no charge for checked in luggage , free snack on the plane , but still budget price .
0	always seems to be trying to trick you on the website .
0	ridiculous charges on luggage , of course great if you don_'_t need checked in luggage , but they must know very few people are travelling without anything that can '_t be taken in the cabin .
0	obviously it lacks shops , and a phone line , but these are two of the things that i have hated about previous network_providers .
0	i have only made one query and it was dealt_with very adequately .
0	fantastically cheap .
0	i continue to use ebay on and off , for selling and buying .
0	i can see that there is a problem with the balance of burden on the seller in conflicts , though have been lucky_enough to not deal with dishonest buyers .
0	products are cheap , but there are a lot of fake , replica , poor quality products .
0	supplement_warehouse has the lowest_prices any where on the internet .
0	the items i purchased can not be bought in stores and the original manufacturer tends to overcharge , and have little sense of expediency .
0	s . w .
0	allows you to track your shipment and even cancel or amend a current order ; assuming it hasn_'_t been shipped already .
0	it '_s not simply a percentage off the full price but nearly_half the cost .
0	even after shipping_costs , which are also lower .
0	this company has achieved the rare status of being an online store with the advantage of group purchase but with small business ideals like customer service , and sense of fair transaction for both_parties .
0	i just wish the secret wasn_'_t out so that i could continue to purchase these 0rd_party , first tier , products at basement prices .
0	i only_assume deals this good don_'_t stay under the proverbial carpet ... this makes it economically viable to try this companies legendary products on a routine basis .
0	i '_m confident that this will be one of the greatest deal giving websites on the net , in the times to come .
0	so buy up quick before everyone , and their brother , wants a piece of the savings pie .
0	overall an excelent company in all departments , fast processsing and delivery of all their goods , even to the channel_islands .
0	all products are competitively_priced and i '_ve never_experienced customer_services better from any other company !
0	top_notch , cannot_fault , asked to be informed when a product was back in stock got an email in a timely_manner , was easy to checkout and was kept_updated of the status of my order at every_stage .
0	will_definitely buy from them again .
0	wonderful service , excellent price , all the music i need in as many places as i need it .
0	just need to get the rhcp and the beatles agreed and it '_ll be perfect .
0	couldn_'_t believe it when somebody designed me some trainers , they ordered the wrong_size and they accepted the return .
0	just hope they are recycled properly :)
0	this is the worst delivery company i have ever had any dealings with .
0	i have never had a successful delivery from this company .
0	i try my very best to avoid buying from other_companies that use yodel as their delivery ' partners '.
0	just because they are the cheapest way to deliver shouldn_'_t mean the likes of amazon , asda and many others use them to deliver .
0	i have had three total losses with them since the merger and the name change ( from hdnl to drop the bad_reputation ) and the rest of the packages i have had to collect the products from the depot .
0	i have complained on every occasion and don_'_t even get a callback or a response when you e_- mail them .
0	this company is a joke , avoid if possible and urge companies to not use them as a delivery partner .
0	i am a true apple fanboy and the products get better and better .
0	i have had apple products for the last 00 years using every os since os 0 .
0	support is great , especially since the advent of the apple retail_stores where i can book a slot at the genius bar and get my problem sorted in store most of the time .
0	however the only reason for the three star_rating and not five is that the products build quality is decreasing rapidly .
0	this year i have had 00 imac '_s scratching optical discs , three ipad '_s with faulty sound , two ipad 0 '_s with faults , 0 macbook chargers fail , 00 hdd failures and an ipod_touch with a flickery screen .
0	i manage three schools mac networks to a total of 000 apple desktops and three servers .
0	the removal of the xserve and the simplifying of os x server has seriously knocked my confidence in apple as a company .
0	i only hope tim cook can rescue the state of the company before it '_s too late and it goes entirely os devices only .
0	buy all my wii and xbox games on it , cheap , quick and relable .
0	ordered my camera on the sunday and it arrived on the tuesday .
0	fantastic packaging , super secure .
0	honestly can '_t find any fault .
0	highly_recommended .
0	kirsty has_been very helpful and understanding :)
0	been ordering from chemuk for many_years_now , always been steller service .
0	always worth_checking the sales out for a cheeky tshirt or some accessories for the missis .
0	would order again without a second thought
0	excellent service , my items got delivered the morning after i ordered them .
0	the prices they had for name brand supplements was significantly_lower_than in - store prices for generic stuff .
0	simply the lowest i have found .
0	shipping is so fast , it is easier than going to a store and buying it there !
0	so i bought a cornilleau_sport 000 indoor .
0	i live in n . ireland and spent a while shopping around for the best price .
0	without_doubt table - tennis - tables . co . uk offered the best possible price in the uk - they beat amazon by £_00 and all of their other uk competitors by ~ £_00 as they were the only company offering free delivery to ni ( others charged ~ £_00 for the 000kg delivery ).
0	i did experience minor_issues with deliveries but neither were within the sphere of influence of table - tennis - tables . co . uk .
0	their customer service was excellent , they chased up the couriers and provided me with information whenever i requested .
0	also as a nice_touch they sent me some champagne chocolates to make up for the delivery issues ( which were not their fault ).
0	overall a fantastic company with clued in , professional and courteous staff ( i dealt_with wendy , russell and tom ).
0	buy with confidence_knowing that you are getting a great price on quality products backed_up by caring customer service - if you live in ni or roi , literally nobody on the internet can beat their prices !!
0	!
0	they sell good posters .
0	i '_ve got 0 posters from the walking dead from them .
0	however i found the service better if ordered from amazon rather_than there actual site .
0	i tried entering a 00_%_off code on their site which didn_'_t work i sent an email to tell them that was 0_weeks_ago and i haven_'_t heard a thing back .
0	customer service and communication could be improved and maybe if they checked there emails once in a while .
0	great prices , good offers , excellent delivery service always bang on time mo issues_whatsoever
0	i have used moonpig for about 0 years_now .
0	various birthdays , anniversaries etc .
0	always as i need , always arriving when i ask , never_let_me down .
0	love it !
0	my rep was a great help dealing_with my question , & was provided a fast & prompt service regarding my questions & was able to resolve my problem instantly -
0	would recommend again in the future for ( on - line support ) :)
0	i ordered three parcels to be picked_up on the same day from this company .
0	0 arrived damaged , the other two went missing .
0	i had to refund the customers , and parcel_monkey only refunded the original postage cost , even_though i insured bot the missing parcels for £_000 .
0	all because their system showed the parcels not having been picked_up .
0	customer service is prompt , but they offer no compensation other than original postage cost even_though you pay extra for insurance .
0	wide birth , avoid .
0	use main companies like city_link , parcel_force , as they provide a tracking_number .
0	the drivers for this company don_'_t have collection tickets , even if you ask for their signature .
0	i had to hand write one and ask the driver to sign it .
0	unbelievably shoddy work !!
0	!
0	i bought a laptop , which was the cheapest i could_find by £_00 .
0	i ordered the item at 00 : am and it was delivered by 0 :_00pm , next_day .
0	i was sent regular_updates_throughout the process .
0	i read someone_else '_s complaint about returns , which hopefully will not happen to me .
0	a copy of this review will be sent to the company , and i '_m_sure it will be in their interest to listen to these complaints and improve the overall service .
0	let '_s give them the benefit of the doubt .
0	so_far , so good :)
0	i booked this company , by searching for the cheapest service online .
0	my parcel was collected on the day , and was received mid day just 00_hours_later .
0	after booking my parcel , i stumbled on these reviews .
0	what i did was open a paypal_dispute immediately after processing the order .
0	i posted a link to this website with reviews , and asked for a refund if the parcel was not picked_up as requested and delivered on time .
0	hopefully someone from the companies office picked_up the dispute and made sure the item was delivered on time
0	its only fair on this occasion , to give them 0_stars for their service , but , read the others reviews before considering their service .
0	there is no number to call the company on if things go_wrong .
0	it looks as though i got lucky !!
0	!
0	i did some digging to find the best price for my 0g ipod_touch and gadget_panda offered by far the best deal .
0	so , i posted my item off to the freepost_address - there was plenty of postage attached to that for me to send via_recorded signed for delivery for just the 00p royal_mail charge and nothing extra .
0	i was kept_informed via_email as to the progress of my payment and i received the cheque promptly .
0	this is clearly a young company - my cheque was hand_written in a stamped , addressed_envelope ( very cute touch ).
0	overall an excellent experience .
0	suggest this place to everyone looking to get there work out supplements and dietary_supplements .
0	they really do have the best prices from everyone_else !
0	!
0	my wife called to say thank_you for the roses in which i asked did she also receive any chocolates , she said no in which it does state to come with these . she then said that to be truthful that i should probably ask for a refund due to most of then being nearly dead and only 00 roses .
0	have also emailed but not likely to get a response any time soon .
0	i '_ve been for more than year with tmobile and experienced many problems with tmobile costumer service team .
0	few moths ago asked tmobile to change my tariff plan and was misinformed by costumer service representative as result overrun my free minutes allowance and was billed en extra £_00 .
0	i had to make many phone_calls and sent official_complaint letter to sort it out .
0	last_week i phoned tmobile and ask them to send to my new addrees micro - sim for an iphone .
0	i especially repeated few_times that i have new address , but representative ignored it and sent micro - sim to old adress however she charged me for it £_00 .
0	moreover tmobile representative blocked my current sim_card so i can not use my phone anymore and to contact them i had to buy pay and go sim .
0	over the next few_days i have contacted tmobile 0 times and every time was given different information_regarding my micro - sim !
0	one representative told me that delivery takes between 0 - 0 working_days , another told me it is next_day delivery and sim should be with me shourtly .
0	sim still_hasn_'_t been delivered .
0	it was funny to listen these_guys especially_considering fact that tmobile costumer service located in india and philippines .
0	i going to tmobile store now , and will have to pay another £_00 to get micro - sim .
0	and most interesting is that there was no need to change sim_card i just needed to cut my old one in any mobile store for free .
0	thank_you tmobile costumer service that i have spent 0 week without phone and already have paid £_00 for nothing .
0	gonna change my carrier for more_expensive but with professional costumer service .
0	excellent quality image , fantastic service and postage speed .
0	can '_t recommend the company enough
0	thanks !!!!
0	0 *****
0	the key was given to me as soon as i purchased the item and it activated perfectly on origin .
0	thanks .
0	i placed an order for a canon_000d , but after 0 days and no email confirmation , i emailed them to ask them why not .
0	they told me the order had not gone_through , and in one of the most difficult to understand emails i have ever received , insisted i must phone them .
0	i asked them why , they didn_'_t say .
0	i told them to phone me .
0	they didn_'_t .
0	eventually i placed the order with another company ( panamoz ) and long after the initial_contact with slr_hut i got an " order confirmation " email .
0	they had put through the original order despite me telling them not to .
0	i had to ring and cancel the order .
0	terrible service , deliberately aimed_at getting you on the phone .
0	how an internet company can possibly only deal via the phone is unbelievable .
0	avoid , their low_prices are bait for foolish customers .
0	would use again but slight dificulty recieving their emails in microsoft outlook , try another browser
0	awesome tour company !
0	definitely highly_recommend morocco - excursions to anyone travelling to merzouga ... our guide hassan mouhou went above and beyond for us !
0	my cousin and i have traveled quite a bit and i have to say , he was by far , the best guide we have ever had .
0	he arranged so many things for us which were not a part of the original tour , our trip to morocco would not have been the same without his help .
0	awesome value for money , beautiful accommodation and a real taste of true berber culture , much_better_than the big commercial tour companies !
0	contact hassan and i promise you will not be disappointed ..
0	phenomenal , simply phenomenal .
0	breathtakingly beautiful , albeit cold , and unlike anything i ' d ever_experienced before .
0	well_worth it !
0	hasan and ishmael looked after us well , cooking the best harira we had in morocco , telling stories and singing songs .
0	our camp was tiny , private and silent - a perfect tranquil stop ( though if we went to the dune top we could see a tent city nearby that apparently housed 000 people with electricity etc ... what '_s the point of that ?)
0	anyone going to morocco for the first time should visit the desert , and these are the folks to do it with .
0	they '_ll look after you
0	imei unlock iphone 0 – 0s – 0 – 0gs official free
0	they have a . co . uk website but everything is still shipped from america .
0	they took over a week to even dispatch my t - shirt .
0	i ordered it on the 0th of december hoping to get it for christmas , but it hasnt arrived and doesnt even have a working tracking code .
0	customer_services they told me i should expect it by the 00th_december .
0	although they might say they ship from america on the about us page , a lot of people wont see this and when your shopping on the site it looks to be a normal uk site .
0	buying any product that takes 00 days for delivery without prior_warning is unacceptable but at christmas its is just outright bad customer service .
0	got a £ 0 , 000 computer from them for gaming and it is shit can only just play bf0 / mw0 on low setting
0	next time i will build my own never again will i go to them for anything
0	large database of places around the world .
0	clean interface .
0	no full pre_- payment .
0	what to want more ?
0	awesome deals and super selection !
0	good shipping to boot .
0	no_complaints at all .
0	you can '_t seem to get my orders to me on release day !
0	again today a game which is released today i haven_'_t recieved .
0	if i know i am going to get them after the weekend i wouldn_'_t order online and just go and buy from a shop !
0	so i '_m not satisfied with your turnaround in getting new games to me .
0	simply_games always get games out to you on time , sometimes early which is even better .
0	compared to some online game retailers it '_s up there with the best for it '_s fast , reliable dispatch and the games always come sealed to a high standand .
0	i would recommend simply_games to anyone tired of receiving not on time .
0	been chatting with sammie_taylor on my first transaction with these_guys and she has helped_me through step by step with the transaction .
0	excellent !
0	thanks for the help sammie !
0	excellent service , very quick and easy , transaction was very fast and i am very happy to use this service again as they have very reasonable prices for my old_mobile .
0	fantastic price paid at a very fast rate
0	quick , no_fuss , nothing beats it for simplicity .
0	te website is clear , helpful and there is a vast_amount of choice .
0	many ' money off ' offers ( which all nutrition supplement websites have right ?
0	), however , echo genuinely seems to be one of , if not the , website offering the best deals .
0	delivery is very quick .
0	also , due to stock issues on my last purchase , the option to change or wait was put forward and the consideration towards me as a valued_customer was evident .
0	will_certainly be using echo_supplements again and recommend them to all who read this review .
0	the first place i look for a supplement is supplement_warehouse .
0	i check their price .
0	then , i spend some time looking at other_websites for their prices , to see if there are any lower .
0	about 00_% of the time , there aren_'_t .
0	the other 0 %, supplement_warehouse wins the game with their 0 % price match .
0	the best supp source online .
0	recieved the sigm 0 . 0 00 for nikon - sharp lens but does have issues in edges of image .
0	as per service - really quick service and delivery .
0	tried and certainly a trusted_supplier - repeat_customer .
0	perfect in every way !
0	fixed my phone back to perfect_condition !
0	amazing job !!
0	highly_recommended !
0	really quick delivery and excellent product - new shaker looks so good !
0	excellent , everything was perfect and the price was great .
0	customer service was friendly , and our items were delivered in pristine_condition and packaged well .
0	i '_ve_used them three_times now and never had a problem .
0	a great range of options , helpful staff with plenty of ideas .
0	i '_m already recommending them to other groups !
0	great service , delivery was faster_than promised and the video reviews of avalanche transceivers were really useful for deciding which one to buy .
0	recommended .
0	was happily surprised how easy it was to purchase my game , and at these prices its insane not to use their site .
0	i got my computer exactly when they said and when i had a little trouble setting_up their costumer service was very helpful
0	i bought cod black_ops 0 from cdkeyhouse and had no_problems at all , smooth and simple transaction through paypal and the key was delivered to my inbox in minutes .
0	its a great service and i would recommend it to anybody who_wants cheep discounted cd_keys rather then paying retail prices .
0	keep_up the great service and support .
0	the product i ordered ticked every box . it was very good quality was very good value and came within 0 days . very satisfied customer !
0	i have been there customer for very long time .
0	the payment process is very fast .
0	amazing very happy with everything
0	never once have i been disappointed with this site .
0	top_marks !
0	i know digitalrev mainly from their youtube_channel , and was actually suprised to learn that they have an online shop .
0	i really like their videos on all_sorts of camera related subjects , and found that the particular camera i was looking to buy ( the canon_000d ) was cheapest on digitalrev out of all the retailers i was looking at .
0	so i ordered it .
0	it arrived within a few_days , was * very * securly packaged and i had no_problems_whatsoever with any_aspect of the transaction .
0	will_definitely order with them again !
0	if there is any_issues their team are helpful and try to get them resolved asap .
0	i paid for next_day delivery on a product which apparently couldn_'_t be delivered when required .
0	no clear_indication on the website , or even a warning when i chose the option it just let_me pay for something i would never receive .
0	spoke to their customer_services who were short , rude and completely_unhelpful , with no offer of a refund on delivery .
0	i have raised this issue with trading_standards as a false representation of a service . after spending_thousands with this company they seemed happy to lose a customer over ten_pounds in delivery costs .
0	i would advise to completely avoid until they amend their website to only sell you products and services they can actually deliver on and change their poor customer relationship attitude .
0	paid about £ 0 for product plus delivery , arrived next working day and product was exactly as specified and worked_perfectly .
0	not a single_complaint , would advise to others and will happily use again in the future .
0	highly_recommend will 000_% buy from them again .
0	cheaper_than anywhere_else , plus the option to add a bunch of free_samples while checking out ?
0	who wouldn_'_t want to shop_here .
0	fast shipping with one low flat_rate , i couldn_'_t be more happy .
0	they ' re helping_me get huge .
0	my flowers from my girlfriend were delivered after she had finished work but rather_than call the delivery agent had just_dumped them outside on a busy main street .
0	and suprise , suprise they got ruined .
0	any way no contact number to get immediate answers and resolution instead i have had to write emails , post on their facebook and message them on facebook , then wait hours for a response which was we will " investigate " nothing to investigate , they messed_up i '_m requesting a full_refund .
0	we '_ll see how that goes .
0	judging from most_recent reviews it appears only london seems to get good service .
0	i have had no_problems with streaming or disc delivery .
0	although i have noticed google_chrome shows lovefilm . com to be an unsecure website .
0	also that after having a disc delivered and returned they just made the same film available for instant viewing , this happened at_least four times .
0	i have only used the service for three_months .
0	i would like to see instant service include dvd and blu_ray extra features like making of and deleted scenes then we can do away with discs altogether , provided lovefilm can retain the license to stream the content as i have noticed many films become unavailable after a time .
0	hazard a guess many other_reviewers might have had streaming problems due to there internet_connection and service provider rather_than any technical fault with lovefilm . com .
0	i only say because when i came close to my own download limit streaming grinded to a halt , took very long to load or did not even start at all .
0	i have simultaneously been a member with lovefilms main_competitor and have had no_problems either in fact its been a better service but lacking in new content .
0	i buy all my supplements at supplementwarehouse because they have all the products i want at a good price .
0	i '_m a customer for life !
0	wrong cable sent and speaker reflects light , completly the opposite of what i was told , just to get a sale .. still_wating for the correct cable to use the speaker ..
0	i won_'_t be doing_business again with this company if sales are all they are interested in .
0	i was originally looking for a wedding_ring i searched the internet as i was could not find the ring i wanted in any of the high_street / shops .
0	i found the diamondgeezer . com website through google , which had just the ring i wanted .
0	i was sceptical at first because of the website name but then found out the owner of the company has featured in an episode of dragon ’_s den , which gave_me all the reassurance i needed .
0	the website has a very useful_tool to check the progress of your order .
0	unfortunately , i received the wrong ring at first but the customer service was quick to fix their mistake .
0	the ring itself looks great just as i expected .
0	the customer service is unbelievably good .
0	clive was the most helpful and polite person i have ever had the chance to speak .
0	mazuma blew me away !
0	they offered a fair price for my phone and all was done and dusted 0 days from me posting phone .
0	would 000_% use again !
0	super_fast delivery excellent prices highly_recomended
0	its a fast and easy to use website the prices where very good it took about 0 mins to set_up my account with them and 0 mins after_placing an order for them to mail the code only thing that was a little miss_leading is the $ 0 on top activation fee whats that when its at home all in all a good site
0	0 months_ago i preorderd aliens colonial marines from amazon due out on 00 feb_0000 the day before it was due to come out was emailed by amazon stating that due to unforseen problems i was not going to get my copy at the launch more than a little annoyed i went_onto the amazon aliens : cm board to see if i was the only one having this shipping problem and as i gussed about 00 other loyal_customers where having the same problem .
0	this is the fourth time amazon has messed_up a preorder i have made and every time they have just brushed me off with a weak apogee so after years of loyal custom with them i decided to cancel the preorder and close my account so i did a short google_search and i came_across simply_games and not only was the game £ 0 cheaper i was going to have to wait only one days as apposed to 0 days with amazon needless to say all my future_purchases will be with simply_games they are fast reliable and cheap shop with confidance 00 / 00
0	its my fourth book from jessops , i was so pleased that they have been able to continue trading their photo_books are the best ones available on line or in stores , both for quality and value for money - although i would recommend holding out for the offers .
0	with the software downloaded to your laptop or pc it means you don_'_t have to wait for pictures to upload or go through suffering at times of high usage , you can complete at your leisure .
0	this most_recent one was of my sons first year , it '_s a massive book and includes the text from an line blog which i have been writing fromm his perspective .
0	really took a lot of time to arrange the text and pictures and getting it uniform throughout the book it was enjoyable to see it coming together and adding more and more pages .
0	all i can say really is that i would and do recommend using cewe_photo_books .
0	signed_up with them a few_days ago and after about ten_minutes i understood the entire software .
0	now i send my invoices within a few minutes every evening .
0	great software !
0	first of all you can only log in with a facebook account ?
0	what is that about ?
0	when there are many of us slowly eliminating facebook from our_lives , besides that what about the endless amounts of fake promotional profiles as i like to call them ,
0	fake accounts that are used to promote websites ?
0	these are then used to rate companies ?
0	dont sound right to me .
0	but my actual complaint about trust_pilot is that you cannot tell the truth !
0	by telling the truth in your review it will be removed !
0	i have a very genuine case against a very big website yet soon as i rate it 0 / 0 and give an honest_opinion based on my many_years experience with the company it is removed and i am sent an email from trust_pilot asking why i have made this review .
0	what ?
0	it s in the review trust_pilot !
0	!
0	!
0	!
0	!
0	the review explains_why i made the review surely ?
0	the worst part is every one else can make a review with out the need for trust_pilot to take it down ask to change then send an email asking why you made it .
0	its a review site isn_'_t it ?
0	its an honest review yet you have taken it down and wont let_me re - post or post another review about this company ?

0	noun
0	the action or crime of making a false spoken statement damaging to a person '_s reputation .
0	verb
0	make false and damaging statements about ( someone ).
0	my website has_been tried and tested and verified safe , we are a registered business and work hard to keep our members happy and safe .
0	we are verified safe by all the companies that actually test website , who are facebook to make the statement ?
0	" this website may be unsafe " <<< facebook statement !
0	facebook are putting up public statements that our sit is not safe !
0	this is a " false spoken statement damaging to our reputation ". i have sent report after report , suggestion after suggestion called the facebook no service customer service phone number only to go round in circles and told at the end they do not offer phone support !
0	and sent a letter the ireland h . q .
0	the customer service is extremely un - satisfactory !
0	if facebook take peoples money facebook should have a customer service !
0	facebook have no customer service !
0	my website is verified registered and verified safe !
0	alexa – verified | mcafee – verified safe | ssl security – certified | trust_pilot - rated trusted | paypal protection – verified | norton safeweb – verified safe | web stats domain – verified 000_% safe | facebook – ( why is it only facebook that says “ maybe un - safe !?)
0	facebook is ranked number one in the world battling between google , if facebook makes an un - warranted decision to display an un - justified message then the herd will believe facebook is right regardless of how wrong facebook is .
0	facebook website is damaging every thing i have taught myself and worked hard for !
0	i pay them money to advertise my site and now they display a message on my site stating it " may be un - safe !"
0	this has_been in place for almost 0_weeks now , this is causing massive loss in traffic , engagement and sales !
0	we are suffering heavily !
0	thanks facebook !
0	your rubbish !
0	bring on [_external_reference_]
0	arrived on time , even after adjustments made by myself late in the day , thoroughly_recommended .
0	hostelbookers is a great website for travelling .
0	i use it every time i travel abroad .
0	there is no beating the convenience of being_able to view so many places by price , location and rating .
0	one of my favourite things about this website is that all the places are reviewed by travellers just like me so i am more likely to stay some place that has a better review rather then just an attractive price .
0	the reviews help me a lot and i believe it is very important to leave a review for all places i stay in for this website .
0	i ’_m so glad i stumbled_upon party_krakow when organising my mates_stag .
0	if i hadn_’_t , i wouldn ’_t have been on one of the finest weekends away i ’ ve ever had or , in fact , returned to krakow just 0_weeks_later with my girlfriend ( with party_krakow ’_s assistance !).
0	krakow ’_s that good i went twice .
0	as with most stag organisers i immediately went straight to the british based tour companies with their flashy websites , easy payment options and – as i found out – cringingly flirtatious and patronising staff .
0	i found these sites useful for ideas but their prices are heavily inflated compared to what you can get if you book it direct .
0	this is what i was planning to do before i found party_krakow .
0	they , by virtue of their contacts in krakow , could pull together a package for even better value than going direct individually .
0	to add to that i met phil , their sales_director , who couldn ’_t do enough to help us and advise us on various things for our weekend ( such as tips on where to eat / drink , exchanging currency etc ).
0	having exchanged a few e_- mails and telephone_calls – to the point where my other half was getting slightly_concerned_about the bromance i was striking up with “ my main man in poland ” as i kept referring to him – phil had managed to sort our weekend out for us at a snip of the price they were trying to charge on said british based websites .
0	the reason these companies get so much business is , i can only_assume , is the fact that they have a british based secure payment website where individual stag goers can pay in instalments .
0	which brings me to the only_slight_negative with party_krakow .
0	when paying there ’_s an element of trust as you ’ re simply transferring_money into their bank_account .
0	firstly an immediate non_refundable £_00 followed_by half of the remaining balance 0_weeks prior to departure .
0	the final amount is paid in cash on arrival .
0	all fine with me as i ’ d collected all the money from the stag goers well in advance , had the opportunity to build up a rapport with phil and do a bit of research_into the company .
0	however , more sceptical organisers may be uncomfortable doing this .
0	the sooner party_krakow invest in a secure payment website similar to their british competitors the better for them ( in my opinion ) as everything else they do is absolutely spot on .
0	anyway , to the weekend .
0	we were staying in the ‘ royale apartment ’_s which i was , initially , a little_dubious_about staying at as i was concerned_about disturbing other people in the block and being too far from the main square .
0	it wasn_’_t a problem – the large apartments are robust enough to cater for a bit of excess noise , they ’ re within easy walking_distance of the main square ( approx .
0	00 - 00 minute_walk_away ) and on the door_step of the kazimeriz area which is where you really want to be anyway .
0	it ’_s absolutely buzzing on a weekend .
0	there ’_s a number of mini supermarkets to stock up on booze nearby as well .
0	another bonus was that there are no keys – it ’_s all done on key codes .
0	secure , warm , comfortable , plenty of hot_water , well located and good value .
0	for our activities on arrival we immediately got picked_up from the airport to shoot some filthy large guns where we were met by our first guide sabine .
0	she spoke excellent english and was really chilled and friendly .
0	we peppered her with questions about where we should go out and what we should do .
0	she was only too pleased to help us out .
0	the gun shooting is over pretty quickly ( about an_hour for 00 of us ) but it ’_s absolutely quality and if you want to fire more ( we went for the basic package ) you can pay as you go after the initial shoot out .
0	on the second day we got picked_up by the party bus in the afternoon .
0	this is unbelievable – it ’_s got an awesome sound system and is really stylishly decked out .
0	i ’ ve never been in a coach quite like it .
0	i was keen to book this as we could arrange a stripper for the stag in a controlled environment .
0	this turned_out to be perfect as it ’_s essentially your own pub on wheels with a stripper .
0	our guide gosia joined us for this trip and after our 0 hour trip on the bus she came out for a beer with us .
0	she was great company and , again , couldn ’_t do enough to help .
0	we didn_’_t pay for “ all you can drink ” on the bus which we were glad about as ( after a boozy lunch ) we only got through 00 beers between the 00 of us .
0	all you can drink is advertised at £ 00pp which – at 0 zloty a beer ( just over a quid ) – equates to about 00 beers in 0 hours just to break even .
0	when the first beer comes free as part of the package we only effectively spent £_00 on beer between the 00 of us .
0	unless you ’ re going to be drinking spirits / champagne or can drink at the speed of a beer every 00_minutes then i ’ d recommend paying as you go .
0	also , there ’_s no toilet on the bus ( they do stops on requests though ).
0	as for krakow itself it ’_s a beautiful city .
0	it ’_s fun , relaxed , classy , tolerant and not in the slightest bit sleazy .
0	if you ’ ve been put off from going by various hyperbolic reviews in the past then don_’_t be , do your research for modern day krakow and give it a go .
0	it ’_s also still incredibly cheap – most beers will cost you less_than £ 0 . 00 for a large beer and you can get a massive feed for about £ 0 .
0	as a stag venue you couldn ’_t really ask for more and if you put your faith in party_krakow you won_’_t be disappointed .

0	chillisauce offer a great service , the choice is very wide_ranging and website is very easy to use .
0	however , the product at the end of it is not worth - in my opinion - what you pay for .
0	we all paid £_000 for two nights dorm accomodation in bristol , night club_entry and deep_sea_fishing .
0	a very brisk bit of research uncovers the fact that the beds that we were in cost £_00 per night .
0	that leaves £_000 for deep_sea_fishing that lasted 0 hours and we had to pay to get to .
0	it was in cardiff and cost a fortune for us to hire a mini_bus for the day !
0	not great value for money .
0	and i very much doubt that the chaps on the boat took home £ 000pp .
0	as for the night club_entry we did take_advantage of this but we had to be there before 00 which , i '_m_sure , you can get for free anyway .
0	chillisauce offer a good service in that they take all the organisation out of your hands .
0	however , if you ' re wiling to spend an evening arranging it yourself i believe you could get the same product for about half of the price .
0	great value .
0	delivered promptly .
0	nothing more really needs to be said !
0	great company , i always buy my supplements from supplement_warehouse .. its cheap fast and they have a larger selection than most everywhere_else ive looked .. plus they beat competitor pricing .. just no reason not to .
0	delvery was excellent very good that i recieved an email to let_me know the time and day my laptops would arrive .
0	value for money was brilliant .
0	definately be using again .
0	purchased three classic football shirts , all arrived in three_days and in fantastic condition .
0	paypal to pay was very useful as well .
0	superb
0	was a little disappointing that some books i purchased were late to be delivered , but other than that , good service .
0	purchased a beautiful three piece_suite from ebay a couple of days ago .
0	superb .

0	i '_ve tried several time to switch from a cash - back website and eon website seems no to work ...
0	first time ive_ever bought a cd_key , i play tera on a f0p account and im part of the tera club i wanted to make a third character but im restricted to 0 characters soooo i looked for a serial key to get the 0 slots instead of buying from the store which would have cost me a stupid amount of money ..
0	easy transaction , got the key , added to my current f0p account on tera website ( eu ) and woop 0 slots , more bank space , awsome !
0	very happy !
0	thanks
0	awesome company , great prices and a massive_range of products , love to use them .
0	mega_fancy_dress offered a wide_range of fancy_dress costumes of all sizes which was important for my needs as i required a larger costumer to dress at stag up for his stag_party .
0	the service , through ebay , was good , payment was very easy and delivery prompted .
0	my only small_criticism , if i were to have one , was that the prices were a little higher_than other fancy_dress shops but the quality of the out fit was of a higher standard .
0	overall a great service .
0	a few_days ago i needed to order 0 - tyres for my car and i decided to purchase these through the national website .
0	the quoted price was £_00 . 00 per_tyre with a big heading saying " buy 0 tyre , get 0 free " although the total_cost came to £_000 . 00 !.
0	my first impression was already one of distrust but it was the only place i could_find with a saturday slot for 00 / 00 /_0000 .
0	on arrival i went into the reception to find no staff , no problem i thought as they might be busy .
0	i waited 0 - mins and then decided to go and find a mechanic .
0	i politely asked if someone could come and talk to me regarding my booking .
0	" you '_ll have to wait , can '_t you see we ' re busy ?"
0	said the man .
0	i responded with an ok and thank_you and proceeded to sit in the reception .
0	another customer was sitting down and conversed with me regarding her own experience that morning .
0	apparently her car was about to be seen only for the mechanic to get a phone_call and spend 00 - mins in the back !
0	we could even hear him shouting at someone on the phone .
0	he eventually came out with no apologises .
0	i have now been waiting 00 - mins and still no - one has acknowledged me even_though i '_ve spent £_000 to support these_guys jobs .
0	" oh mr . mason " said another man who came to reception " is that you ?"
0	i nodded " someone will see you in a bit "...
0	when is ' in a bit '??...
0	the lady said i would miss the whole day at this rate .
0	00 - mins later the man came back in " move your car in for us would you ?".
0	i proceeded to drive the car onto the forecourt and without even a thank_you they started working on my car .
0	i went and sat back in the reception .
0	another 00mins past and one of the mechanics walked in , started eating his sandwich and then approached me and reached for my car key , which was in my hand , without even a friendly gesture or even asking for my car key .
0	i handed it over saying " is my car almost done ?"
0	he walked out .
0	another 00 - mins past and the mechanic sorting my car walked in and sat down at the desk and started typing .
0	after 0 - mins he said " oh mr . mason you can go now its all done ".
0	so off i went to my car with the key left in the ignition , my wipers left on and my lights on full beam .
0	is this garage for real ?!
0	are these_guys just some cowboys who have locked the national mechanics in the back and running some shoddy show out front .
0	extremely unprofessional , unhelpful and rude .
0	i will_certainly be avoiding this garage and all other national auto centre '_s in the future ... my friends will be receiving the same advice .
0	kwik_fit gets a lot of flak in the car world ... at_least the service was friendly and it was cheaper !
0	i bought some ed hardy trainers but ordered the wrong_size .
0	the process of changing the trainers was very easy and smooth .
0	great communication via_email and service .
0	we ordered 0000 a0 double_sided colour fliers for only £_000 and recieved within 0 working_days !
0	was looking for best deal available for canon 00 - 000 0 . 0 is ii .
0	one of the top google suggestions was slrhut .
0	price is way beyond the current market value .
0	and trustpilot reviews made my choice even quicker .
0	since i was in a hurry i had chosen express delivery ( 0 - 0 working_days ).
0	placed an order on wednesday last_week , no shipping notification before i chased the status of the order with customer service on monday .
0	finally item was shipped on monday from usa .
0	arrived on wednesday , i . e .
0	0 working_days .
0	so be aware .
0	but for me it was still on time .
0	box looks good and tidy .
0	first look discovered no faults .
0	very impressed .
0	can '_s wait to put that on my canon_0d mkii .
0	highly_recommend everyone to try slrhut .
0	quick , affordable , reliable !
0	highly_recommended !
0	i saw too many bad comments about this company and want to share my experience with them .
0	i used them 0 times and ordered from them canon_00d , 00 - 00 f0_lens and 000exii flashgun ( all separately ) and everything was delivered next_day .
0	was really impressed with the service i received - i was immediately given a quote online , collection was easy and speedy ( given an_hour_slot for collection ) and payment was fast and the full_amount as given in my quote .
0	great service !
0	i needed a load of flyers printing for a last_minute exhibition in 0 days time .
0	i spoke to one of the designers at the manchester branch and went to meet them .
0	within 00_mins i had all the option presented to me and chose which i thought best , i even switched my business card printing to them there and then .
0	i have been promised a 0 day turn_around , so fingers_crossed it '_ll be ready .
0	the ordering_process was quick and the website well_designed .
0	i was updated frequently on how my order was progressing , including tracked delivery with the royal_mail ( track and trace ).
0	ordered friday_morning and received by midday on saturday .
0	products were well_packaged and exactly as_described .
0	thanks banana_fingers !

0	fantastic service , friendly / helpful communication and great prices ... what more could you ask for ?
0	i ' d wholeheartedly_recommend dragon specs if you ' re looking to buy some new glasses ... much_cheaper_than the high_street and a pleasure to deal with !
0	great company , great service - very clever !
0	don_'_t get a bank loan again !
0	this way of getting a loan , is actually fun and exciting and you don_'_t get ripped_off unlike banks !
0	a + would highly_recommend funding_circle to anyone !
0	i was first introduced to kraft cufflinks through a colleague who only had good things to say about this company .
0	he couldn_'_t have been more right .
0	from the first moment i got in touch with kraft i was provided with an outstanding service and this continued right the way through until the final product was with me !
0	wow my cufflinks looked amazing !
0	even the box they came in was exceptional !
0	thanks for your help and advice throughout my order !
0	i would recommend anyone looking for a mens fashion accessory to use this company !
0	job well_done !
0	high_quality product , great price , professional service .
0	have been using , juno for many_years ...
0	they havent ever failed me , delievery / turnaround times are very good , 0 / 00 orders ( before 0pm ) arrived the next_day .
0	price is normally very good , cd albums etc are normally equal to amazon prices .
0	they ' re always failry upto - date on music release , and give accurate estimations on forthcoming music .
0	any communications iv had with them in the past ( for later orders or damaged goods - which is extremely rare ), they responded quickly & professionaly .
0	i dont really use the juno download section , as in my opinion beatport is the best & the most up front .
0	however , i would say its well_designed and the sample player is really good , so if there was no beatport , i would happily use juno ... its cheaper too !
0	!
0	all - in - all juno is my prefered site for buying artist albums ( techno , house , progressive ) & dj_equipment ( headphones , dj bags etc ).
0	i dont use vinyl any more , but they used to be my main source for buying 00 ".
0	hallo , the keys arrived the very next_day .
0	please use my reply and name if you like including area where we are as part of your totally and highly satisfied customers in every way 0 / price 0 / efficiency / 0 / service 0 / delivery 0 / customer_satisfaction .
0	a0 tops in everything .
0	please use this as a recommendation .
0	whilst the website does look a little dodgy it worked_perfectly and was much_quicker and a hell of a lot more secure than any other cd_key website
0	of all the cd_key selling websites iv ' e used this is by far the most secure one , simply asking for a phone verification and allowing the use of paypal put my mind to rest , this , in addition to the nice layout and the great stock notifications i would happily buy again from them .
0	i placed my order on wednesday before 0 pm and i received an email that states it would be delivered on friday or monday .
0	it '_s friday_evening now and there '_s no news , is this a joke ?
0	ebay delivers from china in 0 days !
0	plus , there '_s so many online sports_supplement s websites that provide same day delivery .
0	ordering on wednesday and waiting till monday is silly , will never order from this site again .
0	i had been looking for a winter_jacket online and had seen a few that i liked on a number of websites such as e_- outdoor . co . uk .
0	having never owned a north_face jacket , i went to my local cotswold store and ended_up trying a few different_styles prior to making an online purchasing decision .
0	i ended_up choosing the north_face redpoint jacket however , the store that i visited did not have one with a hood .
0	i began googling the redpoint jacket when i got home and found that it did come with a hood .
0	e_- outdoor . co . uk were the most competitively_priced and offered free delivery also so i ordered through them .
0	the service from there onwards has_been faultless .
0	i received an order confirmation immediately , a text_message two_days_later asking when i would like the item delivered ( with the option of changing the date or having the item delivered to a neighbour ) and received the item a day later .
0	the whole_process was very professional throughout and i would have absolutely no_hesitation in using this company again or recommending it to a friend .
0	on a final note , i am wearing my purchase as i type this review .
0	the item was received in perfect_condition and exactly as specified .
0	thank_you for a great buying experience .
0	i came_across webtogs whilst_searching for the best price on a the northface base_camp bag for the gym .
0	they were the cheapest price i could_find at the time and even had a 00 %- off promotional period , so the price was cheaper_than i had seen .
0	i '_ve_used the company twice since , getting some argyll boots and a the northface_jacket .
0	all items were shipped fast .
0	i bought my company '_s first colour_laser_printer from them 0 years_ago and have been using them ever_since .
0	they have been consistently good value in toner costs ( and i do compare prices !)
0	and always dispatch fast .
0	i recently_purchased another printer which is serving me well .
0	there was a delay when i ordered an extra - paper tray , but i got a call a few minutes after ordering to inform_me of the delay .
0	the item arrived a few_days_later as promised .
0	i wish all companies were this reliable !
0	i found supplement_warehouse to be the place to go to find the best deals .
0	they will beat any prices you can find online !
0	thanks
0	i submitted an unlock for orange uk ( now ee ) and they said it would be done within 0 week .
0	0 and a half months later , still no unlock , no contact from customer service and best of all they never answer the phone .
0	they blamed orange / t - mobile merger for the delays but another phone shop officially_unlocked it in just three_days !
0	if you want your phone unlocked , do not go here as you '_ll end up paying for nothing - they will not give you a refund either .
0	they also have a tendency to report real feedback to trustpilot as where all their other reviews are not genuine .
0	very good prices and very quick free delivery !
0	two_weeks_later , still no item , no communication / explanation , nor any response to email .
0	edit_: in response to what is stated from tredz below and that they understand that i have " spoken to someone ".
0	no one had been in touch by phone or email at that point .
0	i got a call today and surprise , surprise they had it problems and it is out of stock / discontinued .
0	this also proved the lie below stating that the " order had now been dispatched ", because i cancelled the order over the phone .
0	0 .
0	don_'_t list items for sale that are not for sale .

0	i read previous reviews about this site a lot of people were very happy and therefore i took a chance and purchased an ipod_nano the condition description said scratched up back however when it arrived there were a few marks and i was really happy with the condition .
0	i also used the next_day delivery service as i needed it for a train_journey to scotland i left my house at about 00 :_00am and it arrived just as i had left , however it still fulfilled its agreement to get here before twelve , again i am happy with this service .
0	( do not worry i borrowed an ipod from my dad and i had company anyway .)
0	all in all really happy with the product and the service .
0	it was a class day .
0	description was spot on and all went without a problem
0	the guys at sellmyhome are very thorough and fair and always available when you need them and indeed provide a very personal service .
0	i can '_t imagine getting a better service , certainly not from a high_street agent , and when you factor in how much you would pay to a high_street agent as a % of the property value that makes this a hugely high value service .
0	i wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else in the future .
0	i '_ll be honest , prior to this purchase i ' d never_heard of grooves inc and usually buy most of my electronics from more established websites like amazon .
0	i wanted to buy the ' mighty morphin power rangers season 0 ' dvd set and grooves was one of the very few sites in europe to sell the product .
0	i must_say that i '_ve been left impressed .
0	the order was shipped and delivered quickly , with a great price ( 0 disks with 00 eps on each for £_00 ) and secure_packaging .
0	chuffed to bits that i found these_guys and will_defiantly use them again .
0	bravo .
0	honestly , this was the easiest shopping_experience that i '_ve ever had with suplements and the prices are just great .
0	couldn_'_t be_happier with how everything_went , and i will_definitely shop_here again .
0	the delivery was really fast , however the boxing was badly_damaged , and after i had opened the box , it came apparent that the wood had a bit chipped off , nothing big .
0	furthermore , i had witness the delivery man dropped the boxing , i '_m not too sure whether this caused the damage or somewhere_else during dispatch .
0	it is a shame , but it isn_'_t a big piece that is damaged .
0	would like the one piece to be replaced though .
0	gear0music is a great company where i have always purchased my music_equipment from , and will_continue to buy from them in the future .
0	as this is the only time i have ever had a problem .
0	great service even for a custom design i made myself and skins were very easy to install , looks_like a charm on my desire_hd .
0	very cheap , really fast , no hasle , all legit
0	the service i have received is 0st_class .
0	i ordered some cricket boots and received them the next_day .
0	unfortunately they didn_'_t fit .
0	i sent them back and had my new pair within 0 days !
0	i have no_hesitation in purchasing from barrington_sports again
0	i used this company due to it '_s convenience and had my car collected from work .
0	car passed mot , payment made and i was advised car would be delivered for 0000 .
0	0000 came and went , no car .
0	called the helpline at 0000 to be told by a robotic and non - compassionate advisor that the garage had closed for the day and my car is in the locked compound .
0	i work in a completely remote_location with no links to public_transport and all my colleagues had left for the day .
0	after 0 hours of bouncing calls around and getting no where with the unhelpful agent , i had to make my own arrangements .
0	long_story_short , an_apology was made but no reimbursement for expensive taxi , missed commitments with the family and cancelation of business meetings .
0	convenience turned into a complete nightmare .
0	avoid at all costs !
0	i '_ve bought towbars and generic wiring kits from pf_jones in the past , and was more than happy
0	this is the first time of buying a dedicated_wiring_kit from them
0	i had a problem with it , but after chatting with there fitter and brian from the internet sales_team , we were able to resolve it in the end
0	with service like this , where someone try '_s there best to help you , and returns calls promptly , i would have no problem in buying again or recommending to others
0	pimlico_plumbers have been dealing_with a leak that was discovered under our living_room .
0	the plumber and carpenter who undertook the work , manolo leon - roman and david braidford , were highly skilled and worked very quickly to locate the leak and to fix it .
0	i was very impressed with the service provided by visualsoft , they kept communications with me at every_step of progress the site was making and any_problems i would come_across they would be right there to help solve any_problems .
0	the site is now up and running and we have already recieved orders within a week of the website going live .
0	this shows how well visualsoft are at making a well astablished looking website and how it links in well with search_engines to increase its customer base .
0	thanks .
0	over the last couple of years i have placed 00 or so orders with shopto . net .
0	every_single order has arrived the next_day without_fail .
0	all pre_- orders arrive on the date of release or a day earlier .
0	they are also very competitively_priced , usually beating the other major online_retailers .
0	i cannot recommend them highly_enough .
0	the order process was very quick and will be having my tyres_fitted tomorrow .
0	you can find various things you might need and with a great price .
0	it offers used and new things .
0	great for using in uk and even abroad .
0	has_been with me many_years .
0	love it .
0	:)
0	great place to share your videos and music .
0	i use it alot to watch gute and funny videos and also listening music .
0	it '_s the main search_engine i use .
0	i don_'_t trust others and this one is so easy and looks great .
0	this is a great site for shopping .
0	there is every thing in this one .
0	cheap things and it has many vouchers for the site .
0	i have flown with this airline alot .
0	this far i have had only one insident which easyjet solved quite positively .
0	i had to stay in a 0_star hotell fo a night , which easyjet provided for us and also gave_us and even money to buy food .
0	it '_s great for 0 hour flights .
0	it '_s even better_than orkut .
0	so people who like orkut would like facebook even better .
0	there is more to do than just watch others pictures and write comments .
0	traveling has never been easier and cheaper whit this site .
0	i placed my order at 0000 one evening and it was with me before lunchtime the next_day .
0	the price was extremely competitive ( and i trawled the internet hard ) and they processed my refund quickly and simply - with good email follow_up .
0	i dont normally review anything but the service was so bloody good they deserve 0 minutes of my time .
0	order in confidence , this is a top internet vendor .
0	v quick delivery .
0	will order from them again .
0	everything from this company arrives very fast & their products are always of the highest_quality .
0	i had to return something once = even that was a pleasure as it was dealt_with fast & easy unlike a lot of web companies these days , webtogs take_pride in their great service .
0	their prices are also very competitive & usually are the cheapest around also which always helps .
0	i have used them now a few_times & can highly_recommend them in all ways from ordering to delivery to returns if needs be .

0	i would highly_recommend ebuyer . com for its quick shipping of products and prices are better_than the high_street_stores and you can also shop until 00pm and get the products the next_day
0	i also use ebuyer to compare prices with other online stores and this company is far the best .
0	speedy and excelent quality products :) very happy shopping with them
0	attempt 0 to get through to someone in as many days , currently held for 00_minutes .
0	attempts 0 - 0 i gave up after 00_mins each .
0	attempt 0 their automated callback disconnected me .
0	i got through yesterday , but this time their system was down .
0	been a customer for a week as they supplied our new house , and its been a week too long ; already switching .
0	if this is an example of what scotland has to offer , good luck to them and the potential independence !!
0	shocking .
0	haha sorry i had to say that because i honestly don_'_t know how they got my late 00 : 00 order to me within 00_hours of payment !
0	i will shop at juno again , simples .
0	also if you don_'_t own a pair of iso - acoustic monitor stands then don_'_t rest until you do ... these things should be sold with every monitor , by law .

0	i can understand this if size was the only problem and that was my fault , but the colour was their fault , so i think they could at_least have given me a full_refund , even if not covering my return postage cost .
0	apart_from that customer_services were quick responding and helpful and ordering and speed of delivery was good .
0	i was searching for the best prices on various_bits of kit for a triathlon and found mytriathlon with the best deals .
0	when i came to order another bit , the price was the same as elsewhere , but due to the ease of ordering and speed of delivery , i didn_'_t hesitate to use mytriathlon again .
0	i would recommend them and will use them again .
0	i stumbled_across car del_mar when looking for the cheapest price to hire a car for a trip to snowdon in wales from london .
0	car del_mar provided a deal that was significantly_cheaper then anywhere_else i could_find .
0	booking was simple , the website was easy to use and the information and instructions were nice and clear .
0	the company they had linked me with was very good , polite and there were no_problems_whatsoever .
0	the car was in great condition , practically_brand_new , drove well and was quite economical .
0	returning it was also nice and easy , and a great experience all_round .
0	overall , against the price of a train_ticket for two (£_000 ) total including petrol was £_000 .
0	superb .
0	feetus had a great selection of products , including the one i was looking for at the best price .
0	navigating the shop , finding information about the product and ordering was all very easy .
0	my item arrived quickly and when i had to swap it for the next size up , this was easily accompished and the staff were helpful and friendly .
0	now my review stands_out .
0	tredz is great , i have no_reservations buying form them if they have the best price for what i want .

0	easy to use website , quick delivery , chocolate or chocolate_mint flavours are better_than the coconut ...
0	i was looking for some super hot " lobster " gloves as i get insanely cold fingers ( maybe i '_ve got reynauds ?)
0	and came_across these !
0	they are brilliant and my cold fingers are a thing of the past .
0	i wanted these in a hurry so i could test them in the cold_snap , and alwaysriding delivered them lickety - split ;-) very fast service , couldn_'_t wish for more .
0	brilliant service .
0	quick transaction fast delivery .
0	that '_s all i really need .
0	ok it takes two_weeks but definitely worth it
0	i have got myself a new monster and saved 000 £ compared to a brand .
0	i ordered a switch actuator for a kenwood kettle on 00th_feb_0000 and it promptly arrived a mere 0 months later on the 00th of august_0000 !
0	( yes 0 months , i know amazingly fast right !)
0	once i had recovered from the excitement of my delivery i eagerly opened the package looking_forward to admiring my shiny_new switch ... unfortunately my new found happiness was short_lived .
0	the switch was the wrong_colour ... black instead of white , although after much_deliberation while making a cup of tea i decided that actually i did prefer the colour of the new switch especially in certain light conditions .
0	after all of these ups and downs with this package the absolute worse thing was that the switch was broken on delivery so totally un - switchable !
0	i will look_forward to being_able to update this review in another 0 months when the replacement hopefully arrives .
0	in summary .... worse £ 0 . 00 plus p_&_p ever !
0	i wanted a new ceramic_hob for my kitchen and looking online hughes_direct was the cheapest for the hob i had chosen .
0	the delivery of the item was very fast , and the hob arrived in immaculate_condition and works_perfectly .
0	recommended
0	i telephoned the company for some help as i wasn_'_t sure of a few things and they were very knowledgable and helpful about my requirements .
0	once i ordered my parts they arrived well_packaged within 0 days .
0	i ordered a custom_sized mirror from this company '_s website .
0	the mirror is exactly as ordered .
0	although the stated delivery was 0 - 0 working_days , due to materials not being in stock my order took 00 days to arrive .
0	due to the times delays with my order mirrorsandglass delivered the mirror to me free of charge as a goodwill_gesture .
0	placed my order and delivered within an amount of seconds !!
0	will_definitely use again and recommend to anyone !
0	!
0	ever_since i found out about this website through a friend , its the only place i get my supplements from .
0	great prices and deals and fast shipping !
0	you can sometimes buy in their shop products in good prices , that is the reason i bought from them my seagate 0tb green , the disc failed after few_months , and when you try to contact them they made up senseless excuses , they don_'_t even talk correct sentences just senseless words which you later put_together as meaning '' no sorry '' there is no warranty talk with manufacturer .
0	as they say they are not trained to offer you other product in place of broken one .
0	as when you loose 0tb precious data isn_'_t enough you will end up with empty wallet .
0	i agree dabs . com might know how to sell you a product but that is where they finish their job .
0	and as with every company making business in this way you can read up on their website dozen of comments from supposedly satisfied customers and off course only positive ones how wonderful the company is
0	i did order my item few_days before_xmas , and the item arrived very very quickly .
0	super service , and super price .
0	no word .... 0 minute for a key ... it wonderfull
0	brilliant service , very quick
0	had no_problems with ordering , very informative , quick delivery , no damage , very good service
0	used about 0 times so_far and perfect every time .
0	no more sitting_around at the garage .
0	only down_side is that they don_'_t always have what they advertise on the website which means they call you with an_alternative .
0	i get them to come to my work address as this means i don_'_t waste my time
0	never had a problem with them .
0	i always know what i am looking for and i love the free add_ons !
0	i did have an issue once with an_alternate shipping company , but normally ups or fedex is very fast .
0	the website should have a better search_function , like " pre_workout ", but otherwise it is easy to navigate .
0	very satisfied with my experience .
0	customer service was of an excellent quality , the advice given was clear , the consultants i spoke to were honest , efficient and did what they said they would do .
0	very happy and would recommend to anyone .
0	really amazing service .. i use them all the time and really the best .
0	am a power seller on ebay and i ship a lot , and they are always helpful .
0	just easy transaction and delivered on time .
0	they have some good deals specially with ups .
0	will sure use again
0	i bought a case for my samsung_galaxy_tab 0 . 0 , and i couldn_'_t be_happier with it .
0	unfortunately the elastic_band of the handstrap on the case came loose almost as soon as i received my snugg_case in the mail , but the customer_services team immediately responded to my query and have already got a replacement on the way .
0	friendly , direct communication with a fast response time .
0	if you want to see how a top quality , no - fuss customer service team works , look no further than the team from snugg !
0	the value for money ratio is quite good .
0	however , the food quality doesn_'_t seem to be the best .
0	youtube was the best video sharing website when they started years_ago and they are still the best video platform on the internet !
0	google is still my number one search_engine .
0	i tried bing for some time as i liked their picture change every day etc .
0	but the search_results ( and that '_s obviously the most_important ) are just the best with google !
0	i signed_up with this invoicing service a few_months_ago and was positively_surprised as it is very easy and fast to send invoices .
0	last_week i had a problem with my revenue report which i wanted to export to an excel file and it didn_'_t work .
0	i emailed them and within half an_hour the problem was fixed .
0	top customer service !
0	this company is amazing !
0	i '_m a fitness model , and compete in shows !
0	i '_m always in a hurry and some companies don_'_t have the products i need !
0	so , i truelly really on these_guys to get me preped and ready for my shows !
0	a guide price was given before i sent in my phone , the pre_- paid_envelope arrived a couple of days_later and i popped my phone in and waved goodbye .
0	it was missing a button on the keypad so i was expecting to be contacted about receiving a reduced price .
0	i was pleasantly_surprised when i got an email from mazuma the next_day saying that the full_amount would be paid and that the money would be in my account by midnight .
0	happy days .
0	amazing love this site , instant and cheaper_than high_street , what more could you want !
0	!
0	i love online shopping with tesco .
0	it '_s fast , easy and i don_'_t have to wrestle my way to the checkout !
0	really pleased with my purchase .
0	easy site to get around , found what i was after and the free batteries and no vat were great extras .
0	easy payment , speedy delivery .
0	well recommended !
0	friendly search and easy booking .
0	fast and simple .
0	finds the best deals and displays all relevant_information .
0	have used them before and will_definitely return when booking our next holiday .
0	the website is easy to navigate , offers plenty of information to help you compare each hostels and best of all , charge no commission !
0	the website of choice for booking_hostels :)
0	i only usually leave reviews when i have a negative experience with a site ( like most people ) but after_reading some of the nonsensical negative_reviews here , i will break that habit .
0	to cover some of the points made in some of the other reviews ;
0	- accounts are free and do what they say they do , you can chat with models as a free user , it just depends on the chat restrictions set by each individual model .
0	premium features are naturally reserved for paying customers .
0	- i don_'_t know the exact_amount but the 00_% figure is probably about right for how much models make per token earnt through tips or private shows .
0	think that '_s bad ?
0	factor into the equation the cost that the website bares when serving thousands of cam streams to thousands of users , many of whom are guests or regular members , where does the bandwidth come from for that ?
0	how about when a model earns very little through lack of performance , do they pay back the cost of the bandwidth ?
0	i would estimate there is a profit in there for the administrators but not as much as you might think .
0	- as for tipping models for " off the site " perks , mfc makes it quite clear that all tips are just that ; tips .
0	any agreement you have with the model in exchange for a tip is between you and the model , no moderation or mediation is offered for this , also made clear on the site .
0	if you got taken for a few tokens , rate the model down and move on .. welcome to the real world .
0	i have never personally experienced this but then i just give tips as a token of my appreciation to the model .
0	- i have never personally encountered a poor juddery connection over the past 0 years of using this service but then i guess this is subjective to the models connection , server location and its upstream providers to your isp .
0	- track your ip_address , you bet .
0	find me a subscription website that doesn_'_t do this .
0	what other way would you suggest to trace and block fraudsters and spammers ?
0	if you ' re a legitimate paying rule abiding customer , what do you have to worry_about ?
0	if you are worried_about this , you should delete your facebook , hotmail / gmail account and sign off from the internet .
0	- the website does indeed archive every conversation , not really a secret considering there '_s a link which allows you to view your past conversations with models ... without storing the information , how else would one make this possible ?
0	you could always click the " clear chat logs " link , though that could be some sort of underhand trick or trap so best be careful / s
0	nonsensical codswallop quashed , now onto my experience with mfc ;
0	i '_ve been a member of mfc since_0000 and still a happy paying customer today .
0	i am also a member of other adult cam sites , but this website is frankly a hundred times better_than the others .
0	i prefer this website because it is much richer in features for paying customers than the others , with most other cam sites you are lucky to get a basic " java " chatroom and the option to take a model private .
0	mfc offers a non - laggy free chatroom , private , voyageur and group shows .
0	i could go on but i will sign off by leaving a pro / con list and let you decide for yourself .
0	pros_:
0	- free to use for all users .
0	- private archives ( great way to view your private sessions again , and again ..)
0	- thousands of very beautiful models , there really is someone for everyone .
0	- non laggy ( ajax ?)
0	chatroom .
0	- stable website and connection to cams .
0	- variety of different_ways to spend your tokens ( privates , voyageur , group and tipping ).
0	- a ton of other misc stuff i won_'_t go onto list but it certainly is the most feature_rich cam site .
0	cons_:
0	- ancient green layout .
0	it may have looked nice during web 0 . 0 era but this is 0000 and time for a change .
0	- plenty of ways to filter models but no way to filter by age ... somewhat of an_oversight .
0	- no possible way to change the email address associated with your account ( other than by contacting support ).
0	- support is mediocre and very meh from my experience , and being a " platinum premium " member , i should in theory receive the highest priority level of support .
0	having contacted support on about 0 occasions , i only received replies on 0 of those .
0	it has nearly always been a technical or billing issue that i have contacted them about and not something covered by the wiki documentation .
0	for any other website , i would have stopped visiting it if this had happened , so it '_s a testament to how good this site is that i have chosen to overlook these occasions .
0	i neither work for or know the people who own mfc .
0	this review does not contain an affiliate link .
0	i ordered my ring in november and received it well within the predicted delivery time and wow what an amazing ring !!!
0	i proposed to my girlfriend on christmas day and she hasn_'_t stopped staring at her new addition to her finger since .
0	i cannot thank diamonds_factory enough for their great service .
0	i also walked past a major high_street jewellers today and saw the exact_same ring for £ 0000 , this wouldn_'_t seem a bad price for it until you see that diamonds_factory do the same one for £_000 !!
0	seriously recommend them to anybody .
0	we normally use car_hire 0000 but our last two experience was not very good since they changed to rentalcars . com so we decided to look_elsewhere .
0	we chose elephantcarhire . net based on their reviews here and other_sites it was a great decision .
0	the rates they offer are very similar but they work with much_better suppliers .
0	it makes a lot of difference !
0	we will use elephant from now on .
0	you have wide_range to choose from , you can search on tyres compatible with your vehicle .
0	easy to purchase , good prices and quick delivery , couldn_'_t ask for more .
0	will be using black_circles again .
0	it '_s my second international transfer with transferwise and i couldn_'_t be more satisfied .
0	this could have the potential to seriously disrupt banks ' business in transfers .
0	i had serious doubts_about using it , it really seemed much like a scam like you regularly get by email , but then i saw two people i know on twitter recommending the service .
0	after a quick chat with these_guys ( the simpletax team ), they said the service comes highly_recommended and they even knew the team behind it .
0	can '_t recommend this enough , really .
0	great product , been looking for something like this for a while , and the designs are ace !!
0	!
0	i frequently use vanilla_pods to make ice_cream and i suspect that i have paid way too much for vanilla recently by buying from a supermarket .
0	schwartz put their pods in the same jars they use for all their spices ; totally_inappropriate packaging as they have to bend the pods to put them in the jar .
0	i bought 00 pods from vanilla_mart for less_than the price of two supermarket pods .
0	they were at_least 0cm longer and packaged better .
0	great product and great service , will_definitely use them again .
0	ordered a pair of raybans , came on time with great customer service .
0	would recommend this website to anyone .
0	i hadn_'_t used chillisauce before but i went on a stag organised via the company and was impressed with the organisation of the weekend .
0	when it came down to me to organise a stag , i didn_'_t hesitate to book through them .
0	the prices are fair and the staff really help you tailor the experience .
0	we stayed in edinburgh during the fringe and the location couldn_'_t have been better .
0	there are add on extras like activities such as highland games , paintballing , quad_biking which is great .
0	nearly everything is organised for you - all you need to do is turn_up !
0	i '_ve been ordering from supplement_warehouse for 0 years and have always had a great experience .
0	thier price match has come in handy a few_times , and they always have the lowest_prices around .
0	plus you get free stuff with every order !
0	very pleased thanks
0	shopto is the very best game shop i , ve ever used , the prices are so competitive , and always seen to be cheaper_than other online_retailers .
0	the service is second to none .
0	ive been with shopto for a couple of years_now and have not once recieved a game late , ( after release_date ).
0	on ocasions i sometimes get it a day before release_date which i find amazing and is really good to show my friends on psn that i , ve the game early or on time .
0	i saw a video of how the games get selected and dispatched and was shocked how the machines get the games out faster_than any other online games company .
0	its a thing shopto should be proud of !
0	i will remain to shop at shopto and tell my friends to do so too , as i think its the best personal service anyone can get from a internet gaming shop .
0	thanks shopto
0	andrew holt
0	was not explained to me the photos were going to be smaller than i had ordered due to the different ratio aspect of digital_photos .
0	i had ordered photos 00x00 and were actually 00x00 .
0	they looked awful in the photo_album i had purchased .
0	quick delivery though and customer_support replied quickly when i complained about the size issue but there was no compensation .
0	have studied a few course and have enjoyed them all
0	everything_went_smoothly even the after service - very friendly .
0	ordered samsung_galaxy nexus at best uk price

0	great and quick support by david ( ec0000 )
0	thank_you very much .
0	not a scam , fast , simple and it works like a dream .
0	would highly_recommend
0	you would seriously be a sad state of mind to pay for any program on itv_player , now i like a lot of itv programs but if i miss them on normal tv i just put it down to experience .
0	the adverts never seem to have a problem .......... think about it !!!
0	!
0	i found this site via_google , i won_'_t lie , i had my doubts when i placed my first order , but i went with it .
0	them being located a few hours away only , when i place an order , i receive my stuff very quickly .
0	been a dedicated customer of them and referred many of my friends to them as well !!
0	thanks for the great prices and keep_up the great work guys !!

0	i bought fifa_00 and got it after a heartbeat .
0	nowhere_else you get keys such cheap .
0	the post back envelope arrived promptly and i recieved payment 0 days after i sent the phones .
0	will use again .
0	they are excellent and fast at delivering my products , always have the best prices , even shipping cost isnt too bad with all those free products and super_fast delivery
0	the company had the cheapest price for the product i wanted ; this did not come at the expense of service , quality or delivery .
0	with a small delivery charge , my package came with two_days .
0	the product was secured and packaged efficiently with the product being brand_new with no damage .
0	00 / 00
0	i like this website
0	bought a game_key due to be released in 0 days .

0	typed it into steam and started the preload straight_away .
0	easy to buy
0	great service
0	will use again
0	bought a new wii_u pro controller from them for £_00 total inc delivery , theyre priced up as £_00 everywhere_else also got delivered very quickly .
0	great service
0	my relatively_small order was shipped on the next working day , the product was adequately_packed and arrived_safely , i was kept_informed_throughout the process ( e_- mails for order and dispatch confirmations )
0	great prices , good quality item .
0	unfortunately my costume was a bit damaged upon_arrival but was the manufactures fault .
0	fanciedress were great and sent out new costume instantly before i had even sent mines .
0	and to top it off they paid the return postage .
0	great company will_definitely recommend to friends and shop in the future .
0	excellent , highly_reccomended .
0	ticket was even cheaper_than the face value and it was sold out .
0	a ++
0	i have used hostel_bookers previously before and i simply cannot_fault them .
0	the ease at booking a night is so good .
0	they are number one in my opinion and the fact that they charge no booking_fees makes everything so much_better !
0	thanks again hostel_bookers
0	the site is very nicely_designed with a user_friendly layout .
0	it is very easy to find your account and see what you have ordered and when you will receive it .
0	it also has very responsive and helpful staff who have helped my recover my account recently and also has the prices i have seen on the internet .
0	i don_'_t want that first sentence to sound crazy so i '_ll explain , i was buying 0 rtd muscle_milk drinks a day and they were 0 for $ 0 , well the protein i just bought had 00 servings and simple math showed me i saved 000 dollars compared to buying them the way i was .
0	very glad i found this site and it saved me a lot of money .
0	i would def recommend the site / business .
0	they will beat anybody '_s price and add a reasonable shipping charge .
0	never had an issue with delivery either .
0	i give them all my business and tell others to as well .
0	the game was delivered to me in under fifteen_minutes despite the weird time frame on when i ordered it .
0	i was installed the game with little trouble .
0	no issues arose and there was no need to ever contact them .
0	great service , can '_t believe i have received such a pleased service , they are truely professional & at the same time very polite , helpful & humble people .
0	absolutely awesome , excellent & fabulous service i have received .
0	my very big sofa was collected on time , i was well informed about the dates & timings , seller was equally informed , hence a great communication .
0	my sofa couldn_'_t go through the stair case because stair case is narrow .
0	boy put his brain & spent their time in sorting it out .
0	within few minutes my sofa was in my living_room .
0	they not only placed the sofa where we wanted , they also did the job arranging the stuff around .
0	i cannot get a service better_than them anywhere .
0	a true example of best customer service .
0	hats_off to boy .
0	thanks a lot , would always take their service & would recommend 000_%.
0	you can take my words for sure .
0	u won_'_t be disappointed at all
0	i am very pleased
0	thanks ,

0	ups are so bad it is barely comprehensible .
0	imagine a delivery company that turns_up in your postcode , doesn_'_t ring your buzzer , doesn_'_t knock on your door , and then leaves without letting you know they were there .
0	apparently , on planet ups , this counts as an attempted delivery .
0	of course , for all of the psychic people in the uk , this is no problem at all .
0	for the rest of us , this is not exactly ideal .
0	and then imagine you arrange for them to come on another day , agree a specific date with them , receive email confirmation of this date , and then they turn_up again 0 week before this agreed date .
0	what are they thinking might happen ?
0	there are a few things i can '_t fathom about ups : how they can be so stupid , and how they can make any money mindlessly attempting to deliver items .
0	i will never , ever , ever knowingly use a company that has ups as its delivery company .
0	good experience ordering , and communications were good up until delivery .
0	then it went_downhill with messages not passed between made and the delivery company .
0	product arrived and it '_s ok . quite average craftsmanship .
0	the tiles are perfect - fantastic value , and a great product .
0	the delivery not so good .
0	£_00 delivery charge for our order and they don_'_t even deliver to your flat .
0	driver told us they can '_t even go up steps , leaving us with hundreds of kilos of tiles on the floor outside our apartment building .
0	not so classy , guys .
0	quick delivery , excellent product , great service .
0	very , very impressed with these_guys .
0	makes me want to buy another mattress !
0	provided the exact_same product to my previous_supplier , however their prices where more competitive and above all they delivered when they said they would no up to 0_weeks late ( like my previous_supplier )
0	easy to contact and fast to reply to emails .
0	i have already place another slightly_bigger order and would have no_hesitation in recommending premier lockers .
0	first order fine although received a few_days late .
0	my second and larger order has_been a complete_shambles .
0	i ordered the same product by in slightly_larger_quantities .
0	was given a delivery date via_email confirmation .
0	the delivery date come and went with no communication from them .
0	a few_days after the delivery date i emailed and received no reply , i used online_chat and was told it is out of stock , i asked when do they expect stock and was told " i don_'_t know i don_'_t deal with online orders " i asked why no one had bothered to call or email and let_me know and was again told i don_'_t deal with online orders ask mike ( i ' v never had any dealings with anyone called mike and had no contact details .
0	about a week after the delivery date i emailed asking for an update and no reply again .
0	i re emailed asking for a refund no reply .
0	complete_waste of time and now have to wait for paypal to refund .
0	will not be using workwear ( not ) express again .
0	* in response to workwear_express reply *
0	a copy and pasted reply is not good customer service , and saying " i will look into what occurred to ensure that these sorts of problems don_'_t arise for future customers " is pointless just reading the first 00 or so reviews you '_ve said this at_least 0 times , so either you '_ve not looked into what occurred as you claim or you '_ve not sorted things out .
0	its amazing that you '_ve failed to reply to my emails yet within minutes you reply to my review and contact me regarding my paypal_dispute .
0	if you are in fact sorry as you claim to be give me a refund and learn and take on board what the reviews say instead of simply offering a generic_reply and forgetting about it .
0	this company is claiming to be based at 000 moston lane , however this is not the case and 000 moston lane is my address , we have never had any dealings with them except the countless people visiting to complain .
0	avoid this company as any order your place will result in your money being lost and nothing to show for it .
0	this company is a complete scam , the office address they are using to claim they have a uk office is infact my property .
0	the police visited today with a warrant as they are ripping_people off selling them container loads of paper at a fraction of the uk retail price however it never shows up and nor do your money .
0	i am only on my second month with plus net and i '_m on my third fault .
0	trying to get someone to listen when reporting a fault is like pulling_teeth .
0	always the same question have you changed the micro filter , router is your phone ok they then say they will run some tests and it could take up to 00_hours .
0	on all 0 occasion after the 00_hours is up they send an email_saying the support_ticket has_been closed as your internet is now connected .
0	i have to go through the whole rigmarole again because its still not working .
0	0 months 0 faults and about 0 days with no connection whatsoever yet they still wont send an engineer out .
0	i waited on hold for 00_minutes only for the phone to cut_off .
0	when through their online trouble shooter about 00 stupid_questions in is says sorry there was a problem please try later .
0	well plus . net i consider you to be in breach of our contract and will now be terminating my services , 00 month_contract or not .
0	complete_shambles and complete_waste of time run by people who cannot think for themselves only readying auto prompt of their computer screens .
0	the worst thing you ever did was to sell out to bt .
0	this is a scam the website offers downloads and installs a tool bar , changes your home page and search providers then puts a popup saying the download you requested is no_longer available .
0	i have a good anti_virus so have tried on a couple of different files and all do exactly the same .
0	don_'_t waste your time and risk downloading something you cannot get_rid of .
0	quick delivery at good prices with a good selection of products .
0	would recommend
0	very poor , been waiting on a delivery for 0_weeks now tracking keeps saying tried to deliver .
0	we ' re a business open 0 - 0 yet they claim they tried to deliver and left a card .
0	we '_ve never closed during the day and no card was left .
0	business should stop using them as their carrier , my supplier has now lost my business simply because yodel cannot do what they are paid to do .
0	hostelbookers is so much_cheaper and didn_'_t charge any booking_fee .
0	as i am a student , this really give me a great offer and it '_s not annoying like other website .

0	i ordered 0 corsair 000d cases for me and my little bros build , after ordering it and reading the reviews i was really afraid if it would happen to me and after that i was trying to get a refund they said they were gonna dispatch it already they said i can refuse delivery and get a refund i said nvm ill keep the item .
0	they responded really quick thumbs_up to them for that .
0	also tracking was easy with ups .

0	never ever using this again !.
0	just seen the reply , 0 its my word vs your word about phone being damaged .

0	excellent service , would use again !
0	super quick service - it was that fast that to get any faster you would need to print it before i even placed my order ...
0	i have been buying from ebuyer for years , either by paying by card or getting credit i have not had one problem and it is even better when they give me free next_day delivery .
0	what makes it even better is you can order some items really late and get it the next_day .
0	i mainly stick to computer_components or entertainment products like my 00 " samsung i bought from them the other day at around 0pm and it was delivered the next_day .
0	so all in all ebuyer is one of the best companies i have found .
0	just wish they could stop tempting me to buy more stuff ;)
0	came_across onlycdkeys with google so looked at the reviews from previous_purchasers on here and everything looked fine .
0	so i thought i would give it a go , and with in 0mins after registration and telephone verification i had 00 months ps plus instantly .
0	so yeah in one word " brilliant "
0	easy website to use and the items ordered were here next_day and also extremely cheap prices .
0	my father and i went to nepal in october this year in to attempt the everest_base_camp trek with private himalaya / expeditions ( pe ).
0	the experience was amazing and one we will never forget , right from the start we were so well looked after by pe .
0	pimba , one of the guides and an everest summiteer met us at the aiprort and drove us straight to our hotel for a welcome beer after 00 hs of travel !
0	the next_day we were due to fly out to lukla and as many trekkers will know the planes do not fly from kathmandu to lukla unless the weather is perfect ... we were not so lucky and it took 0 days for us to get out to lukla in clear weather .
0	throughout the whole time at the aiport in kathmandu , pimba from pe did his absolute best each day to get us on any flight he could and really looked after us , ferrying us each day from the hotel to the airport and back when we weren_'_t successful .
0	each night he came up with a plan for the next_day until we eventually flew out on the 0th day and started our trek .
0	for our actual trek we had our personal guide dorje and our porter dhjiban - both were brilliant .
0	we felt very safe with dorje and he was a lot of fun , although serious when he had to be to make_sure we understood things ( like not having alcohol on the way up to ebc !)
0	the attention to detail was pretty_impressive , making_sure we ate and drank well , checking our oxygen levels each night and making_sure we were being honest about how we felt physically .
0	as we had lost the 0 days at the start dorje had to change the trek on the fly and did so brilliantly without rushing us , always telling us " slowly ... slowly "
0	dhijban our porter ( 00 years old ) was pretty awesome carrying our bags every day and beating is on each section of the trek ... embarrassing actually !
0	when we tipped him at the end he came to say thank_you and you could tell he was very genuine ... he was very shy !
0	after a few tough sleepless_nights near ebc dorje was always more concerned_about our health than getting to the top but when we made it he took me up to the top of a steep ridge and we took some amazing photos for 00_mins before starting down in the snow !
0	dorje became a friend , we had an amazing experience together and we celebrated in style on the final night in lukla ... i will be going back and i will be asking dorje to be our guide .... the next challenge looks_like island peak !
0	the best recommedation i could give is to use pe again and i will be doing that with my wife in the next 0 years .. island peak is a definite and there is always kili in the future which is what makes pe so impressive , their global scale .
0	my father and i would both highly_recommend pe to anyone_thinking of going trekking or climbing ... thank_you to the whole pe team and i am sorry i took so long to write this but work has taken revenge on me for taking 0 . 0_weeks off in a row !
0	thanks very much

0	when it comes in shopping online there is no better place than amazon , they have all the products that you need from supplements , foods , etc ....

0	great site
0	superb service every time
0	tried lots of different mens skin care products but dryhide moisturiser is by far the best i have ever tried .
0	some great advice and info on their blog as well .
0	taxi travel is the best company for all your travelling needs .

0	they are always on time and get me to my destination in a prompt manner .
0	the pricing is always competitive and their service always exceeds_expectation .
0	i would recommend them to anyone !
0	certainly worthy of these 0_stars !
0	they had the best price i could_find , including with free delivery , and the item arrived a few_days earlier_than it '_s actual release_date .
0	couldn_'_t be more happy and will_definitely use again
0	lauren_w of parcel0go . com was amazingly helpful she helped sort_out my problem so quickly and efficiently she is a credit to the company .
0	i had a really big problem with one of the delivery companies and she sorted it out no problem and talked_me through processes and answered all my questions in a professional yet friendly_manner .
0	i was in such a bad mood about all this delivery trouble i was having but now i know its been sorted_out im happy again and its all thanks to lauren_w , so thank_you lauren you were wonderful
0	friendly staff , quality work , cheapest prices :) well_done .
0	ps_: just waiting time could improve as for changing tyres i have been waiting for an_hour is quite a lot , but i know , you don ; t know when exactly i was comming in as when you book in , you have just option am or pm .
0	this awful company let_me down in couple of occasions .
0	couple of time they didn_'_t even left the card , but when i checked online - attempted delivery card left .
0	but funny think was , that i was home at all time .
0	so literally the self employees drivers showing the company that they are at work even they are not .
0	so they just scan a package in the car but they never go to the address .
0	and after 0 attemps , they will just return package to the depot .
0	and depot is about 00miles_away from my house :) and phone customer_support won_'_t even give you phone number for the driver .
0	i have never_experienced worst delivery company in my life .
0	nice web_site , most of the parts what customer need it is there , fast shipment , just would be beneficial for you to allow customers pay by paypal .
0	the website gave loads of hostels to choose from , depending on what you want and how much you have to spend .
0	made the booking process very simple and quick .
0	will_definitely be using again .
0	i found the website very easy to use the pre_- paid_envelope arrived the next_day , i posted it off and the money was in my account the same day they acknowledged_receipt of my phone ... you cant_beat that for service very fast and efficient .
0	i was told about this site from a friend and i thought he was using something untrustworthy .
0	a few_days_later i used the site and was amazed at the low_prices and how fast i got my cd_key sent to my email ( roughly 0 minute )
0	i did have 0 key which didnt work , i emailed them about the problem and i was provided with a new key very fast ... so the support is also excelent from this site .
0	i will_definately keep using this site in the future , 0_stars and a big_thumbs_up for cjs_cd_keys
0	always fast despatch time + delivery times , easy to communicate with !
0	what more can you ask for a * service !
0	saved £_00 off football_manager 0000 and had the working cd_key within minutes .
0	couldn_'_t ask for anything more .
0	top quality service .
0	bought a few items from liberty_flights and in very happy with the quality of products and the price is great .
0	i highly_recommend libertyflights for all your vaping_needs .
0	i have recently tried 00 of totally_wicked gold standard concentrates and i am very happy !!
0	some of the best concentrates around imo , around 00 - 00_% i find a good average for fruit flavours and only 0 % with tobacco .
0	i loved 00 of them - they are top_notch , amazing flavours to vape - especially cherry ( 00 %)+ menthol - mixed 00 / 00 ( 0 %).
0	im new to mixing but its been a huge_success !
0	i also received a £_00 gift_card , very nice_surprise !
0	service is second to none , can email and even ring them thanks totally_wicked .
0	good prices , great tasting juice !
0	service is excellent , pleasure to buy from , highly_reccomended !
0	i '_ve purchased suits in store and the customer service and quality has_been fantastic .
0	when purchasing on - line however , the customer service is non_existent .
0	phoning the customer service team over a period of three_days led to no response .
0	only when i put my issue on the public profile of their facebook_page did i get a response .
0	the clothing is of good quality , there is no issue there .
0	i just wish they would actually have a customer service team you could instantly get hold of .
0	i cannot_believe that people have had bad_experiences with this company .
0	i have purchased many products from cotswold outdoor , both instore and online .
0	every time i receive 00 / 00 customer service , the products are always excellent and if on the odd chance the item does not fit or function properly , then i have always received a quick refund .
0	i will be shopping from this store for many_years to come .
0	i ordered a leather restorer spray to treat my holdall and it was exactly_what was needed .
0	delivery was fast as always and i will_continue to buy from the store .
0	having read previous_comments i have also had a poor experience with this company .
0	i had two samsung_galaxy_s0 '_s that were in very good condition and was lured to this company because of the fantastic price they offered ( they were offering 00_% more than [_external_reference_] or [_external_reference ]).
0	when they phones were tested that apparently had bad bezel damage , they didn_'_t , and the price offered was a fraction of the original .
0	haggling occurred and then finally i settled on a price as it was clear i was not going to receive my phones back .
0	also had a major problem with getting payment as they took down the wrong details and then had the phone put down on me by their customer_services team when all i wanted was to sort_out my details so i could get paid .
0	please avoid them and go for a more recognised and trusted company , they are just not worth the hassle .
0	i can always trust that webtogs will not only have the gear i want at a competitive price , but will also provide a first_class customer service .
0	bought an_engagement_ring from diamondgeezer . com amazing ring fantastic price .
0	wired0fire did a great job of making a custom - built_pc .
0	they replied to all my emails within a day - once i realised this was the case keeping track of the order was great , as they could tell me exactly_what was going on , and they even install linux on the pc for me for a very reasonable additional_cost .
0	great stuff , will shop with them again .
0	ordered two items on line and opted for the next_day delivery option ... low and behold the very next_day by 00 am they were with me two fantastic products that were in a sale making them exceptional value and with the reward_scheme have made my experience even better for value will_certainly be using facewest again and again it certainly looks as though the loyalty is rewarded i have already told my climbing partner where to come for his next purchase
0	i have ordered liquid from them and order came through slightly wrong , but after one e_- mail to customer_services it got sorted really well as i received missing item next_day .
0	very good experience and would recommend them to anyone .
0	the holiday was better_than_expected , very helpful staff , perfect oranisation , lookin for next year `_s with them at the moment :)
0	ordered a tv online and was told the delivery would be between 00 . 00am and 0 . 00pm during the week , so i had to take an afternoon off work to make_sure i was in the house to accept the delivery .
0	i arrived at home just after 00 . 00 .
0	as soon as i got home i got a call from my partner saying that the delivery man had been and gone .
0	it had come to our attention that the delivery man had tried to drop_off our item outside the agreed time forcing us to arrange a new delivery date a week_later !
0	this is extremely frustrating as i had to take the entire afternoon of work for someone_else '_s incompetence .
0	we decided to cancel the product and ask for our refund which was over £_000 .
0	they said we would be refunded within 0 - 0 working_days , but after a week of nothing , we decided to call again .
0	apparently the refund request hadn_'_t gone_through , so we had to request it again , waiting another 0 days until we got our money back .
0	firstly , my home hub kept dropping connection , so i had to call to get a replacement .
0	you ' d think this would be a straight_forward task , but after much_deliberation with customer_services , they finally gave in and accepted that it was indeed a fault with the home home a week_later .
0	i got a new one , but then my bt_vision stopped_working .
0	again i had to jump_through_hoops to get this resolved ... but it never did .
0	to add_insult to injury , i moved_into a new home with my partner who is also a bt customer .
0	you ' d think it would be easy to merge our accounts .
0	nope .
0	they charged me £_000 + to cancel .
0	thanks bt .
0	but wait , there '_s more .
0	when i did move in with my partner , we wanted to get set_up with our existing services for our new home .
0	this was the final_straw .
0	after agreeing to an installation date , bt phoned us and cancelled , rearranging a date for a week_later !
0	they also charged us £_00 for a month without_any service which we tried to get refunded .
0	after calling customer_services and being on hold for a total of 0 hours , i finally got through to the right people and by this stage i was happy to cancel our account all together .
0	it '_s an_absolute_joke and should be criminal .
0	goodbye bt .
0	hello sky .
0	great site for finding offers on lip balms and nail polishes which is helpful for when buying gifts .
0	extensive_range on colours and fast delivery with easy to use website .
0	could be a site i use regularly ...
0	called up floridatix to get various theme_park tickets for the family trip to orlando this summer .
0	very friendly service and all the tickets arrived within 00_hours .
0	we ' re very excited to go and chuffed with the service .
0	will_definately recommend or use again if we decide to go back to orlando .
0	just as i expected , nothing too fancy but not too bad either .
0	did the job and for a a cheap flight and i had a great holiday .
0	i can see again !
0	awesome website with great choice .
0	catwalk feature really helps to bridge the gap_between website and high_street shop .
0	always good stuff at great prices , big_fan !
0	i will come_back and recommend .
0	thank_you !!
0	!
0	i and my boss ordered two mobile_phones , my boss ' order went through ok whereas mine was blocked .
0	i called them to resolve this , but despite the website advertising delivery within 00_hours , after 00_hours neither order had been processed .
0	my boss ' phone eventually arrived this morning , opened and used .
0	i have immediately submitted a returns request and have cancelled my order .
0	they may have the best prices , but it '_s balanced by dreadful and dishonest service .
0	treated_myself to a business class seat from arlanda to heathrow .
0	the business lounge was very bland .
0	boarding the aircraft , i found two children sat in my seat , asked them to move , to which a very rude father replied that i should seat where the children should be sitting .
0	the cabin_crew did nothing to resolve the situation , so i was left sitting in the wrong seat .
0	polite cabin_crew otherwise but bland food .
0	on time .
0	an entirely hassle_free process .
0	i entered what was required online , printed one document and because i was eager for my money , i sent it in a padded_bag that i had lying_around .
0	although it '_s freepost , i ' d recommend queueing at the post_office for a proof of posting , just for the £_00 compensation cover should your phone go missing in transit .
0	within three_days my phone had been received and the money was in my account !
0	i had considered selling it on ebay , but the hassle of advertising it , the fees and the risk that the buyer would want to return it just put me off .
0	so impressed that my partner has sent their phones to mazuma as well , and they got exactly the same great service !
0	highly_recommended !
0	have had some issues with paypal re payment , the seller has_been so good and patient , keeping in touch and responding to all my messages .
0	as soon as payment was received - item was dispatched and received next_day .
0	also item was very good value for money .
0	highly_reccomended .
0	thank_you .
0	arunas .
0	great products at very good prices for what they are !
0	some of the best out there on the market .
0	fast delivery comes within 0 - 0 days of ordering , very efficient !
0	very pleased costumer and will_definitely be purchasing again in the future , 0_stars assured .
0	very quick delivery and great products on offer , would recommend to anyone !
0	fab service extremly helpful and understandable helped_me with my depression needed glasses asap , very very very good service staff and company thumbs_up !!
0	!
0	probably the best and smoooooooth transactions ever very quick and class service , defenatley recomend
0	long_story_short , royal_mail lost my package and i spent 0_weeks on the phone with automated switchboards before they admitted they lost it .
0	then i was told i had to contact the seller and get them to send the item out again and that the seller could apply for reimbursement .
0	i was worried that this was going to be even more hassle as bannafingers hadn_'_t done a thing wrong , why should they be out of pocket ?
0	but i rang them up ( phone was picked_up on the first ring !)
0	and 0 minutes later my replacement trousers where ordered , with free next_day delivery to apologise for royal_mails mistake !
0	and half the phone_call was having a nice moaning session about the post service .
0	amazing company !
0	i had a problem and they fixed it immediately , no faff and no red_tape .
0	i feel a sudden pang of loyalty to bananafingers now and will buy here a lot more often with the knowledge that any_problems will be sorted .
0	we '_ve_used our local_branch of national for years and have nothing negative to say .
0	they are prompt , professional , courteous and have always shown themselves to be reliable .
0	what can i say about wired0fire ?
0	where to begin is the question .
0	i shall begin with some background first .
0	i set out to build a custom_pc , for simulations and extreme graphics performance .
0	this was 0 years_ago .
0	the fabled alienware pc was an inviting option , but after_placing my order with them , my parts failed to materialise for a fortnight .
0	i did some reviews and seeing the decline in customer_satisfaction , i bailed ship and requested a refund .
0	then i found a small company called wired0fire .
0	they had some good reviews , as did plenty of other_companies i found on the net .
0	but what made me trust them from the start , was the professional and knowledgable team of people that greeted me on the phone .
0	not once but several_times i rang them to ask questions and they knew their stuff inside out .
0	also , they answered the phone within five rings and were always polite and helpful .
0	so i to took the plunge and invested my hard_earned_cash with them .
0	and , i can proudly say , here iam 0 years later smiling contently at the beast that purrs beside my desk .
0	one thing that was important for me when i was purchasing the pc was future proofing it for as long as possible .
0	i wanted to make_sure i could upgrade as time went by and the system i wanted was faithly built as per my instructions .
0	over the years i upgraded the graphics_cards , then i went sli ( twin graphics_cards for increased rendering performance ) and increased the amount of ram .
0	one thing to note .
0	they say actions speak_louder_than words .
0	unfortanetly , i cannot show you what this pc can do but i will tell you of an experience i had when i contacted wired0fire about 0 years_ago .
0	i was using 0000gtx sli at the time and i wanted to upgrade to 000gtx sli .
0	i rang up wired0fire to ask if i could upgrade , or if there was anything i should be aware of .
0	they could have just sold me the 000gtx cards , saying they wil work on my system , but they didnt .
0	they pulled up my computer data from their records and advised that i would require different power connections for the 000gtx to work .
0	there was also other concerns that might lead to potential issues and wired0fire advised that the 000gtx would be the next best thing to go for .
0	the 000gtx was more_expensive .
0	they could have sold that to me and left me to get on with it .
0	they had no obligation to assist me as my warranty had expired years before .
0	so , i think its clear that wired0fire are not money grabbers , out to make a quick buck .
0	i can_honestly_say , that even after all this time , i can still ring them up and they will help me through thick and thin .
0	they still answer that phone within five rings and the person on the end of the phone is not a call_centre .
0	this review is more of a thankyou .
0	i sincerely thank_you toby , peter and the team for the standards you set out to reach and for maintaining excellant customer_services and satisfication .
0	your computers are the best .
0	you have won my respect and i cant tell you how difficult it is to find companies like yourselves in todays money driven market .
0	to anyone reading this review , considering whether to purchase through wired0fire or not .
0	i can tell you this , no one can beat them .
0	they have a morale standard of excellance that you dont find in many companies today .
0	most of them are out to get your money .
0	these_guys are out to show you what you missing out on .
0	if you want to go elite , then give them a call and you wont look back , you wont_regret it .
0	my second order with digitalrev 0x happy .... recommended !
0	if you are thinking_about buying anything from this company .... forget it terrible company sent me a faulty pair of headphones tried to contact them several_times .... no one ever picks_up the phone .... i did get a reply email but nothing was done about it .... i has_been 0_weeks and several_attempts to get a replacement or refund with no joy .
0	still_waiting for a solution from them !

0	this site was recommended to me by a friend so i decided to check it out .
0	i was immediately blown_away by the low_prices and assortment of items .
0	supplement_warehouse hase everything imaginable and for a low price .
0	plus you can add tons of free items to your order , which is awesome !
0	very happy with the site .
0	a great website with all the info you need .
0	i found it cheaper_than anywhere_else and the service was so quick .
0	really happy and i will use again when i find something that i want .
0	i have when been a customer of t - mobile been unfortunate to have received poor coverage on my mobile , however with the recent merging of signals with orange then this could really improve their total coverage throughout the uk >
0	as always with british_airways i had a great experience , friendly staff , on time and comfortable .
0	i flew from germany via heathrow to newcastle and had a stress - free flight .
0	i have flown with ba several_times and still have yet to be dissapointed
0	from the moment i applied for their pack the whole_process was quick .
0	my return envelope arrived within two_days allowing me to send my old_phones off .
0	as i had asked to be paid by cheque i didn_'_t receive my money on the day they arrived but my cheque came through my door 0 days after sending the old_phones off .
0	the cheque was for the money i had been quoted .
0	overall i was very happy with the service .
0	i set_up a vps with heart and in the same day discovered that the server backup costs were way more than i had imagined .
0	i had moved from rackspace to save_money and now discovered it would be costing more , fair_enough its my mistake .
0	i spoke to heart and they were happy to cancel the account which was great , unfortunately they refused to refund any money .
0	the account had been open less_than a day and i had paid for a full year - so it cost me over £_000 for less_than a day '_s hosting .
0	i would have been happy to pay for the days service i used or even a month , but the stance the took of charging for a full year really surprised me .
0	companies with that kind of money_grabbing attitude do nothing to help their reputations and i will happily be staying with rackspace .
0	i made two orders - one a couple of days before_christmas and one a couple of days after .
0	both arrived in less_than 00_hours which was very impressive considering the time of year .
0	the items were also the best priced i could_find on the internet and arrived in perfect_condition , couldn_'_t ask for more .
0	ordered a pedal_board case and it arrived next_day can '_t complain hassle_free will use gak again .
0	it '_s been 0 days since i ordered now and i '_ve gotten in touch and had no reply from " customer_services " i wish i used a big well_known website and i will never make this mistake again !
0	very quick delivery high_quality products for low_prices .
0	was using amazon back in the days of them only selling books and on a dial - up internet_connection .
0	never once had an issue .
0	pretty_much what all e_- commerce businesses should_aspire to .
0	i '_ve been ordering from moby_memory for over a year , they '_ve always provided a reliable service .
0	i ordered a micro_sd last_week and got it today , i '_ll definitely be ordering from them in future .
0	quick delivery , thanks .
0	i purchased a stuburt rain_jacket that unfortunately developed a fault .
0	sent a picture of the fault to golf000 and within a few hours they got back to me stating that if i returned it then they would send out a brand_new one asap .
0	now that '_s customer service .
0	thank_you !
0	to anyone in and around the derby area , buy your clubs from here !
0	went to purchase a 0 wood and was blown_away by the customer service there .
0	was fully fitted for my new r00 0 wood and was given some invaluable swing tips to boot .
0	oh and they were exactly the same price as the golf websites so great value for money as well .
0	try them !
0	did the job but prices not the cheapest !
0	ordered 0 footjoy gloves ( sci_- flex and pure touch ), price was excellent and delivery was 0 days .
0	would say notification e_- mails of order status could be better but that '_s only a minor_issue !
0	these_guys are scam_artists !
0	thought their prices were too good to be true but thought i ' d give them a go , what an_idiot i was !!!
0	good never turned_up , now having to go through crazy chargeback process , which is taking for ever to get back .
0	made a booking , ordered 0 coaches for my brothers wedding day and paid on that basis .
0	on the day of the booking they sent 0 double decker and simply fobbed us off with some rubbish about the other bus breaking_down and having tried to contact us .
0	this was unacceptable to us due to certain cultural issues ( women and men should travel on separate coaches as the men tend to be drunk on the way back from the wedding_reception ).
0	now they refuse to refund us on the basis that only 0 coach turned_up and worse they keep changing their story as to why they feel they are not at fault .
0	i '_m now taking this up with my solicitor as well as the confederation of passenger transport uk .
0	you ( the public ) have been_warned !!
0	!
0	i use interlink on a daily_basis and have to say that they have been impeccable since i '_ve been with them ( especially compared to the nightmare that was dhl who i used before ).
0	only thing is i wish they were able to offer more competitive_prices for shipping to northern_ireland ( still have to use dhl for that ).
0	staff at my local_depot are beyond excellent and importantly they are reachable on a direct line and always answer within a couple of rings .
0	with dhl you get put in a queue to speak to some teenager who hasn_'_t got a clue and couldn_'_t care less .
0	keep it up interlink and don_'_t rest on your laurels !
0	couldnt be eny happyer with the prices thx ...
0	easey way to sell best place
0	i order a single baseball_cap with a home made logo on it as a test of the quality of the products made by this company .
0	the image i gave them was not high_quality and they tried to tell me this .
0	unfortunately their emails got lost in my junk_mail folder , and when i finally checked this folder they had gone ahead and made the cap with the image i sent .
0	the cap that arrived was well made , and the printed image was much higher quality than i ever_imagined .
0	the customer service people that tried to contact my were polite , helpful and were trying their best to give my the best quality item they could .
0	after about 0 attempts to contact me they made the cap as best as they could and i am very satisfied with the quality , speed of delivery , and the company as a whole .
0	i will be ordering more from this company very soon
0	i am extremely impressed by westin_gourmet .
0	being somebody who has_been raised to be paranoid about food safety , especially when it comes to chicken , i was very wary about ordering meat online .
0	but due to being about to begin a fitness diet where i would be eating excessive amounts of chicken_breast , i decided to look into buying it in bulk .
0	after a bit of research , i came_across westin_gourmet '_s wonderful website , and regardless of my apprehension about having meat posted to me , i found myself intruiged .
0	the sheer_amount of choice on offer immediately captivated me and made me salivate , and the brilliant prices just made it all the more_appealing .
0	deciding to take a risk ( slight_exaggeration , i did a lot of research online first to make_sure they were a reliable company ) i made an order of 00kg of chicken_breast .
0	not only that , but after hunting through their numerous good deals i managed to acquire a free corn - fed whole chicken to go with it ( this deal has now expired but they appear to have frequent new deals so have a look ).
0	when my box arrived i excitedly opened it up , not knowing what to expect .
0	i immediately could see that my worries had been for nothing - the chicken_breasts were sealed in sturdy professional plastic packaging ( seemed more solid than what i get at tesco ), the whole chicken nicely contained in a bag , surrounded_by ice_packs that were still_frozen solid , and then encased in padding , all inside the box .
0	and i got a box of freezer bags for free too !
0	all this i promptly put in the freezer , very pleased with my decision .
0	but of course , the final test was to come - the meat itself .
0	for the price i paid , i half expected some steroid - filled water - injected live chicken to be sat staring at me , its pupils enormous from the cocktail of chemicals it had been fed on .
0	but of course ( thank_god !)
0	this was also just foolishness on my part .
0	because not only is the price per chicken_breast much much_better_than any pitiful attempt at a deal i have received from the local_supermarkets , it is also very decent meat !
0	i had unwittingly grown used to eating chicken_breast which had been bloated on water by money - hungry supermarkets , and so was very pleased when i cut into one of the enormous chicken_breasts from westin_gourmet and found it to be just pure meat !
0	no water - injection , no added salt , just the genuine taste of good quality chicken .
0	now of course , my review isn_'_t all encompassing - i am yet to try one of their many appealing steaks , any of their wide_range of sausages and burgers , or their luscious looking lamb , but i most definitely will be doing so in the near_future , and i have every confidence that this company will impress me again and again .
0	i can '_t recommend this company enough .
0	for years i had been buying expensive supplements from online websites , slowly watching my money disappearing on products which would not last more than a few weeks .
0	it was disheartening .
0	then i found out about myprotein . com , and initially , i assumed for their prices they had to be either an incredibly well - made scam , or incredibly low quality .
0	however , after hunting for reviews and opinions on them , i began to realise the truth - they were genuine !
0	now , i have been using them for years , and would not use anybody_else - the quality of their products speak for themselves , and not only are the prices significant lower_than the brand - name supplements , but they come in much larger_quantities too !
0	i adore this company , and feel that the only reason people can possibly be buying the more_expensive brand - name products has to be either a magpie - like attraction to colourful labels , or that they simply have not yet been directed to myprotein . com .
0	i know i am gushing on , and so may sound false , but if you have a bit of money spare , buy some creatine from myprotein . com and from a more_expensive online_retailer , test them both out , and you will understand fully .
0	long live myprotein . com !
0	!
0	had a good look around on the internet to find a supplier who not only had the right products .
0	but also at a very competitive price .
0	will be going back again for more stock
0	i went with affordablemobiles after three offered a poor deal , affordablemobiles had the same deal but no upfront cost and £_00 cashback .
0	i ordred at 0pm friday and it arrived saturday_morning at 0am at my work !
0	i was amazed !
0	brilliant service .
0	would recommend to all .
0	i '_ve_used fonebanker for years every since my se k000 .
0	you can get more money from other_companies but fonebanker is easy to use and fast payment times .
0	always amazing and on time .
0	excellent choice of products !
0	i recently_bought an electronic_drum_kit for myself , excellent price on the website and such fast , free delivery .
0	the only_drawback i can think of was the delivery man was really grumpy but that '_s fedex not gak !
0	this is the easiest transaction i '_ve ever done online .
0	check value
0	receive bag
0	send
0	??
0	?
0	profit !
0	i have been ordering from supplement_warehouse for quite a while now and have never been unhappy with anything i have purchased from them .
0	i generally pick_up a few things that are past date but guaranteed fresh and have never been dissapointed with these items either .
0	thank_you supplement_warehouse !
0	can '_t wait to rock the new t - shirts i ordered .
0	fantastic quick service thanks to chris day of i independent_merchant_services for getting us all set_up to take card_payments .
0	will be recommending to my other business friends :)
0	very misleading and terms of contract are shocking .
0	do not take out a product or service with this company .
0	i have since cancelled my policy
0	just want to say how helpful your on line chat service is .
0	i had a problem with collection today and isabella helped out by re arranging my collection for tomorrow .
0	thanks again parcel0go !
0	!
0	0nd review : thank_you once again sammie_taylor .
0	you were most helpful and patient in helping_me out again .
0	i placed an order over the weekend for valentines_day with " courier track and trace " delivery .
0	the order was accepted and i received a confirmation e_- mail but when i view my account the order has disappeared and i have not received any tracking_number at all ( you would have thought this was essential right ?).
0	the item has sold out also so i '_m increasingly worried that they couldn_'_t fulfil all orders and just cancelled them .. live_chat was offline and they '_ve not responded to my e_- mails .
0	ringing up the bank first thing and disputing .
0	very easy and very fast .
0	i played on 000 a few_times now and they have always been fair and allowed_me to withdraw my money promptly .
0	on top of doing everything they need to do as a casino 000 goes the extra_mile and always offers great promotions .
0	got a phone_call to discuss my eligibility for a free boiler and the woman i spoke to talked_me through everything and was very helpful .
0	would definitely recommend .
0	i have ordered in the past and after two orders having fraud charges following them i decided not to order from this site anymore .
0	one thing however , their prices are the best around and that comes in handy when needing to support ones fitness habits .
0	plus they beat_competitors prices which is always a benefit .
0	one detractor is the shipping cost but when you use the thanks0 coupon_code it basically discounts the shipping to what you might pay with other_sites .
0	im giving a neutral review as for right now due to anticipating another possible fraud charge which i hope doesnt_happen a third time ..
0	i enjoy shopping the large selections and the insane discounts i just cant seem to get my head around the fraud purchases me and my friends have received so this is only to be aware of the possibility of it happening to all the customers out there .
0	please call the customer service line to report any fraud so they can immediately jump on it .
0	they cant fix it and find the problem if no one speaks up .
0	overall i like this company will update my review at a later date .
0	great service , and quick delivery !
0	will buy again !
0	nothing to complain_about .
0	kept you up to date with where your parcel was .
0	arrived on time .
0	no_complains .
0	will use again !
0	they sent emails_keeping you up to date and dealt_with the request very fast .
0	i should add that the quote was for a broken phone and they gave_me the price offered .
0	literally the best , fast and easiest money making way to get_rid of your ipad .
0	thanks so much :)
0	chosen purely_because they had by far the best prices for the items i was looking for , the very quick delivery was an added_bonus .
0	i don_'_t wanna sound like a cliche automated script , but ok , i ordered a bag from them , it was totally to my liking , dispatched and arrived quickly by dpd , and came with a free_gift , and that was despite the fact it was a good £_00 less_than elsewhere !
0	i dunno about repeat_business because it '_s not something i regularly need to keep repurchasing , but if i do , i know where to go !
0	they have a good range of stock , all arrived within a few_days .
0	only a couple of gripes , seems they only have one set of prices regardless of weight or class , just different speeds .
0	also , there are a few more items they could have that their competitors stock , especially sushi related .
0	marj lopes at round the world_experts was recommended to me by a good friend , and what a recommendation it was .
0	marj was great , she took my requirements and created an amazing itinerary for me .
0	she understood what i wanted from my trip and got me the best possible deal .
0	i would recommend marj to anyone .
0	top service - personal , efficient , great value
0	first time customer , placed a order for a canvas at 0 . 00am , had a email to say it was ready for collection at 00 . 00am
0	excellent service , great quality , would thoroughly_recommend and will be using in the future !
0	thank_you
0	got the tyres i wanted and made a massive_saving on what i was quoted , def_use again ..
0	sold 0 ipods , sent on a monday and paid what they quoted , money was in my account on the friday , very quick service , would use again .
0	disgusting service , 00 days_later item is not delivered and wont give a refund because " i still used the service "
0	obviously mistakes_happen in parcel delivery - but it truly shows what a company is like by how the deal with the mistake .
0	either my hermes is really bad - or quite_simply their customer advisors need some good training .
0	mazuma may pay less_than others but mazuma are honest and very quick with payment .
0	take a tenner less but you know you will get excellent service
0	tickets arrived on time and even called me when dispatched .
0	great service !
0	w . neil
0	on top of this they have a great refferal scheme .
0	i '_ve often shopped with zavvi , as they '_ll post some very competitive offers .
0	going online has served them well !
0	usually very competitive and their own products are great , delivery is free and very fast for free delivery !
0	after ordering a pair of expensive headphone from them , less_than 00_minutes later i realised they were the wrong ones , despite the description saying differently .
0	because of this i requested a cancellation which could not be processed 00_minutes after i ordered .
0	due to this i had to wait for the product to arrive from france , only to refuse it and send it back - a waste of everyones time .
0	in the middle of all this , i was trying to tell them that this product wasn_'_t described properly and that they should change it .
0	each reply was a half - assed attempt and each time they told me i was wrong and that it was correctly listed .
0	after 0 or 0 e_- mails they eventually accepted that the description was wrong and gave_me a poor_excuse for an_apology .
0	to this day , the headphone are still listed incorrectly .
0	do not buy from pixmania .
0	ever >
0	the title_says it all .
0	i bought a steam cd_key of bioshock_infinite .
0	the delivery was almost_instantaneous and it worked .
0	the checkout is easy enough to navigate , as is the website itself .
0	it was also the cheapest price available anywhere for that game .
0	i don_'_t normally_write_reviews in fact this is my first .
0	i would recommend this company to anyone .
0	they did exactly_what they said , they would do .
0	i ordered a phone & headset bundle on the 0 / 00 / 00 and it arrived the morning of 00 / 00 / 00 i even got an email with and hour delivery slot and the guy was here bang on time .
0	the product was well_packaged when i opened everything was there and was up and running in a minute .
0	will_definitely be using again .
0	i was interested in a pair of cdj '_s so had been on the website a few_times to check prices etc and i wanted to know info about the bstock .
0	i rang the sales_team who instantly informed me of a better deal only available through the sales_team so i took them up on the deal .
0	great lads in the sales_team , arrived next_day without a hitch , i am now smashing out mixes of nightlife 0 - happy days .
0	no_complaints from me would not_hesitate to use them again .
0	i made an order and i received it the very next_day .
0	great prices too !
0	ordered yesterday and received the very next_day .
0	0 hour eta .
0	what else can you ask .... great service !!
0	!
0	i ordered two pillows on 00 - jan - 0000 .
0	they said that they need 0 days to deliver them .
0	today is 00 - jan - 0000 and i didn_'_t hear from them .
0	i called them 0 times and every time they told next week .
0	currently , nobody_answers the phone !
0	!
0	i ordered a chair on friday 00 - jan - 0000 .
0	they called me next_day to inform_me that the product is out of stock and that they will receive new stock on monday .
0	the customer service agent assured me that i will receive it on tuesday .
0	i called them on tuesday and they told me that they did not receive new stock yet so i have to wait_until the end of the week or until monday , so apparently they don_'_t know when .
0	this company is out of credibility .
0	this is not how a respectful companies do_business .
0	p . s : i posted this review on their website but unsurprisingly they did not post it and make it visible to other customers .
0	they only post 0_stars reviews and this supports the incredibility claim .
0	i first found the website as they were selling some ski_goggles that i wanted .
0	however , the price was cheaper_elsewhere .
0	although they couldn_'_t match the price , they did offer to reduce it and send the product out to me quicker_than the other website .
0	the man who i spoke to on the phone was very helpful , and even recognised me when i called back later regarding my order .
0	the item was received next_day , and shipping was included for free .
0	i ordered the bose qc0 from rgbdirect as they showed up on google_shopping as being the cheapest .
0	the website was not outstanding , however , they more than made up for this with the price and the level of customer service .
0	i spoke to somebody on the phone who followed up on stock_levels and called back .
0	he then called again to confirm the delivery date .
0	overall , i was very impressed with the level of customer service .
0	i '_m basing this on a few purchases made over the last few_years .
0	generally , the prices are pretty good on expansys , offering cheaper_alternatives to expensive branded products .
0	the delivery is actually pretty good and i have had no issues there .
0	i have two main things to complain_about .
0	firstly , they send a lot of marketing emails ( an email every 0 - 0 days ).
0	i would prefer if they had a more intelligent system , whereby they sent me specific offers i would be interested in .
0	my second complaint is about the lightning to 00 - pin adapter i bought - i know trustpilot isn_'_t generally for product reviews , but this was an expansys branded product so i feel it is justified .
0	the product description showed the same features as the standard apple adapter - support for charging , sync , analog audio , usb audio , and yet the product did not work as designed with a docking_station or fm_transmitter .
0	i am still_awaiting a response from expansys on this , after which i may update this review .
0	i know a lot of people have got bad things to say about carphone_warehouse - i don_'_t know if they have issues in terms of contract phones , but for ordering an offline phone they were pretty good .
0	i ordered the iphone 0 on the first pre_- order day from the apple_store online with a delivery time of 0 - 0_weeks after the release_date of friday 00 september_0000 .
0	however , due to some changing travel_plans , i cancelled the order .
0	i then checked the carphone_warehouse website , which showed a delivery date of monday 00 september and the same price as the apple_store .
0	i phoned to confirm this as it seemed too good to believe , and it turned_out to be true - i was however told that it may possibly be delivered on tuesday if there are any unexpected delays .
0	to my surprise , the phone actually arrived on friday 00 september ( the release_date of the phone ).
0	this was great - i managed to get the new iphone , on the day of release , without having to queue for hours at the apple_store !
0	ordering online was much_easier , especially with available sizes .
0	however , there are a few improvements i would suggest :
0	0 .
0	some of the imagery is not sufficient for you to see the product .
0	it was only because i had been in store that i knew what the product actually looked like .
0	for example , with the occasion suits , you are offered things like shirts on the same page , with no detailed images of the shirts being worn without the suit jacket .
0	0 .
0	the navigation on the site looks good , but makes it difficult to see the difference_between certain products .
0	it '_s a pain to have to go through various frames of what is effectively a flash banner just to get to the correct product .
0	great for mindless browsing , not so good for finding what you want .
0	0 .
0	charging shipping on a £_000 order is a bit_cheeky .
0	from all the online shopping i have done , i have found even where shipping isn_'_t free ( it normally is ), it is at_least free for higher value orders ( e . g .
0	over £_00 or over £_000 ).
0	0 .
0	while i like the idea of not being charged for your product until you are happy with it , it makes the ordering_process confusing .
0	it also tries to lure you into subscribing to the magazine without making recurring charges clear .
0	also , there seems to be no option to pay the amount straight_away - it seems you need to wait for a statement .
0	i guess you are working on the fact that people may forget to pay for their goods , allowing you to charge interest ?
0	quality of the products were good .
0	shipping was on time so no_complaints on that side .
0	i ordered a shirt for a wedding from mytuxedo , and it was better value than anywhere_else i had seen .
0	the site looked professional and was easy to use .
0	everything was well integrated with their couriers so that i received updates from both_sides at the correct times .
0	i have had issues with dpd before where they have delivered to the wrong_address and just left the package on the doorstep .
0	i gave them the benefit of the doubt as there are 0 properties with the same house number .
0	however , on my most_recent delivery , i was very clear about the location .
0	they still attempted to deliver to the wrong_address .
0	when i tried to call to resolve this , there seemed to be no way to speak to a human .
0	i used the website to just arrange_collection rather_than have another failed delivery .
0	when i went to the local_depot , there was a small door resembling a fire_exit for collections ( at_least the entrance for the staff looked nice !).
0	i pressed the buzzer no less_than three_times with no answer .
0	eventually , after_speaking to someone at the staff entrance , they finally let_me in .
0	all in all , i think it '_s a terrible service .
0	i do get a lot of emails from groupon ( at_least 0 a day , sometimes up to 0 ).
0	i think their emails should be more targeted and specific .
0	i don_'_t want to have to sift_through tens of offers to find the ones most suited to me .
0	surely you can ask for more information in the user profile and then choose offers accordingly ?
0	on a more positive_note , the offers are usually pretty good .
0	i '_ve taken_advantage of a couple of them .
0	have used crucial before to order ram for my machine as theirs is one of the best rated .
0	the selector on the site makes it much_easier to choose the correct product .
0	i ordered yesterday_afternoon with the ( free ) standard delivery and got the item this morning .
0	i love receiving firebox emails and going on the website .
0	they have an interesting range of products , and they don_'_t annoy me with a barrage of emails .
0	no issues when i have ordered with them in the past .

0	i '_ve ordered many_times over the years from amazon .
0	never had any_issues with payment , delivery or any other part of the service .
0	i had an issue with a product just once , and despite the manufacturer being completely_useless , amazon solved my problem quickly and easily .
0	i will_definitely be using this site again

0	good service with all the information i needed
0	i ordered an ipod fm_transmitter on 00th_july_0000 .
0	after no sight nor sound for a week i emailed them and got the typical automated_response .
0	i emailed again , same response .
0	i read the reviews and decided i was going to lose out one way or another so i bombarded them with an email every three hours or so in large text and started then on the complaints @ datakits . co . uk .
0	they have not replied but my item has now been dispatched ... despite telling them i want a refund .
0	lets_see what turns_up first ... my item or those flying pigs i ordered off amazon where i should have gone in the first place .
0	seriously ... sending my luggage from the uk to france was crazy fast and painless !!
0	i '_ll definitely keep on using this service and i recommend it to anyone !
0	!
0	went to google_shopping to look for some spray_paint and found ffx to be a really good price .
0	reasonable postage cost too .
0	they accepted paypal so i went_ahead and ordered .
0	it arrived less_than 00_hours_later .
0	very pleased with the service and will_certainly use them again .
0	added them to my favourites straight_away .
0	very cheap deals and arrived very quickly with superb packaging , would definately buy from here again
0	having bought the engagement_ring for my fiancee in march_0000 from quality diamonds , we returned to purchcase both of our_wedding_rings from quality diamonds too .
0	the service , choice and quality of the items is absolutely first_rate and the company are a real_pleasure to deal with .
0	there is no pressure to purchase ( unlike many other_places in hatton_gardens ) and the prices are very good indeed .
0	all in all , thoroughly_recommended and the whole team are great to work with .
0	the interface of the site is quite intuitive - all needed fields are right at the place they have to be .
0	data array is awesome - hundreds of hostels and good prices , really .
0	more than that , each hostel provide plenty of details about it - dozens of photos , all_kinds of rooms and exact prices , precise location and so on .
0	integration with maps and guest reviews rise the level of usage experience .
0	the only little thing that was a little uncomfortable - i couldn_'_t find a way to look for specific hostel at the site , but sure that there are an option for it .
0	very nice !!!
0	!
0	flight times changed , not informed missed flight , whole holiday ruined .
0	no response to complaint email even after there stated 00 day responce time .
0	no contact telephone_number for customer_services listed and when you do call asking for legal department , management or cheif executives office you get nothing only someone will be in touch and a point_blank refusal to help !
0	book with someone_else evasive nasty and slippery i won_'_t be back not to be trusted !
0	been plagued by text_messages_confirming delivery slot and date on 0 seperate deliverys .
0	once item was late and missed time_slot by 0 hours and on 0 occasions arrived the day after stated delivery date !
0	ii ' d give them a miss !
0	would highly_recommend very efficient fast services , products arrive in good condition and with excellent use by dates .
0	also one of the cheapest sites around !
0	i saved over £_00 on a year ’_s flea and worm_treatment for my two cats ( by vets_prescription ) which you think would slow things down , the items still arrived next_day after emailing my prescription straight after the order for my products .
0	all you have to do is attach your order no and email your vet ’_s prescription to the address provided , and my products still arrived the next working day .
0	also you have the opportunity to leave a comment or note with your order as in the past my items from other_suppliers have been sent in a jiffy_bag and have arrived crushed , i asked for my items to be sent in a box to avoid this using the comments / notes box on the order form and that ’_s exactly_what they did .
0	would not_hesitate to recommend to anyone or to use again !
0	i also had to put my cat with allergies back onto a prescription_diet this order was also received the following working day by city_link less_than 00_hours after the order was placed !
0	fantastic .
0	a *****
0	love this site .
0	easy was to earn_money without even thinking_about ti .
0	you can do your online shopping as normal .
0	then visit the site before you buy and earn a little mint .
0	a must if you are signing_up to a subscription service .
0	i really like using ebuyer , not only is it one of the few stores listed on topcashback that sells computer_components and peripherals , but it also and has a very user_friendly design and very comprehensive search_function .
0	i haven_'_t had a problem with deliveries in the past and it gets fairly steady_flow of customer reviews on each product .
0	very pleased with the service .
0	very easy to use website - makes the act of sinning with a dirty takeaway even more effortless .
0	no more fighting over who calls up and sends the order , you can simply pass round your laptop and add what you want .
0	huge_variety of food and widely utilised by many of the takeaways so you can pretty_much get anything you want - from your standard pizzas to caribbean , sweets , and booze .
0	i ' d also like to add in the early days i had several orders that went missing that i never received .
0	you can go onto the justeat website and talk to a rep via a chat_window - i did this and got a full_refund every time .
0	very impressed with the expedient repair on my phone .
0	iphone 0 smashed front and back with various chips all around .
0	i received the phone back in outstanding condition .
0	i would certainly recommend repairs0everyone to anyone !
0	!
0	the company is awful , good luck to anyone returning faulty goods because the return_policy is not worth the paper its written on .
0	i will not touch them with barge poll after my experience .
0	better off spending money elsewhere with a more reputable_company that offers a decent returns / exchanges and doesn_'_t charge you a fortune .
0	they are not competitive with some smaller products being up to 0 x the price of other_retailers like ebuyer or scan .
0	the community forums are just full of very rude and patronising , egotistical , arrogant ( insert explicit word ) people .
0	i was a member there before all my troubles started i am now leaving this place well alone .
0	i have used this company many_times , the items i have ordered have arrived quickly but packaging can be lacking .
0	my most_recent order i specified a day for delivery because i wasn_'_t in , but the package turned_up in less_than 00hrs .
0	impressive speed but not much good if your not in .
0	luckily a family_member was at home at the time of delivery .
0	the item i had ordered arrived in a robust box but was far to big and had no packaging to stop it rolling around .
0	again i was lucky the manufacture had done a better job with its own packaging so the item arrived in good condition .
0	in general the company are fast and cheap but dont always follow delivery instructions .
0	packaging can arrive well boxed but on occasions like my last order in a big empty box left to rattle around .
0	i ordered a microwave one saturday and it was delivered the next_day , which was fantastic .
0	unfortunately it did not work .
0	i phoned and emailed many_times .
0	the unit was eventually collected 00 days after delivery and the refund was done 00 days after delivery .
0	i think that '_s appauling customer service .
0	ethan in particular needs re - educating in customer service .
0	i '_ve always had a good experience using hungryhouse .
0	i can say anymore , other than , i will_continue to use them !
0	i really can '_t fault the guys at why buy new .
0	i '_ve_used them several_times both instore and online .
0	i just wouldn_'_t recommend the courier company they use , as the driver delivered my parcel to a flat 0 blocks away !
0	great service thanks
0	great prices , everything was booked online , with a follow_up phone - call almost_immediately to confirm prices and booking details .
0	fitter was prompt and helpful , and managed to fit both tyres in a crowded car_park with very little room !
0	website is fantastically easy to use , i was looking at hiring a tuxedo but found the parts i was missing at mytuxedo for a brilliant price .
0	sets are cheap , mix and match items are well - priced - have not worn my shirt and tie yet but have tried it on for size and am pleased with the results .
0	great site !
0	000_quid_cheaper_than going directly to the shop i had them fitted !!
0	recommend them highly
0	i bought a watch of watchfinder came the next_day i didnt like the watch the watch was fine just to big on my wrist i sent it back and got a refund without eny hassle so for me enyone looking to buy of these over the internet cant go far wrong thay even emailed to say thay had received it in the morning then emailed to say i had the money back in the afternoon no doubt some companys would mess u about n try and not refund u i will use these_guys again keep_up the good service u wont go far wrong with watchfinder thats my experience with them enyway
0	i recently ordered a new av_amp from this store .
0	they responded quickly to all correspondence , delivered the item when they said they would and had the best prices i could_find online .
0	can '_t think of a reason to shop anywhere_else !
0	couldn_'_t be_happier with the service provided .
0	website is easy to use , received email_updates plus i was kept_informed of the delivery date by phone .
0	brilliant range of tyres too !
0	ordered a phase 00 on the thursday and by friday it was sitting comfortably next to my big muff .
0	absolutely fantastic , especially when you are able to track every_stage of your delivery through dpd '_s website .
0	not forgetting they also send you a sms and email in the morning telling you the estimated time ( usually within an_hour_window ) they will be at your doorstep , allowing you to pop out of the house for a quick pint down the pub to dream of your new product before it arrives .
0	of course every product i buy for my guitar will be done through guitarguitar .
0	thanks folks
0	these_guys are great , the webpage may not be really well_organised especially with those long lists of items but it '_s not too annoying .
0	the prices are great for some products , e . g .
0	things here may be cheaper somewhere_else but somewhere_else may be more_expensive .
0	you just need to research your prices !
0	but their delivery and dispatch times are terrific .
0	this company is horrific .
0	the staff are horrible and don_'_t give a damn about you .
0	i have bought there frequently over the few_years but recently due to new staff i will not be returning .
0	the staff are unhelpful , lazy , you ask them a question they sigh .
0	you ring them up to ask about an order they sigh down the phone and act like they don_'_t care .
0	the pricing / website is also a joke .
0	i went into the store two_days ago and spoke to a staff_member , we ordered myself a motherboard which is stated on the website as well as the manufacturing code - asus m0a00l - m lx v0 .
0	when he printed out the collection receipt it said asus m0a00l - m lx which is obviously incorrect .
0	( the v0 / revision 0 supports my 000w cpu unlike the original only supporting 00w ).
0	i then asked_him to change it and make_sure i get the v0 version .
0	he said okay , reprinted , we left .
0	when i arrived to pick it up the next_day guess_what i received ?
0	asus m0a00l - m lx .
0	so i complained to him about receiving the wrong one , and guess_what he says to me ?
0	' no this is the right one , it is the v0 version .
0	you need to research your stuff before you buy it '.
0	my god .
0	i got so angry .
0	the fact that he said a customer is wrong is just plain stupid .
0	it clearly_states on their website , their manufacturing code and their own staff that i ordered a v0 .
0	so i just couldn_'_t be_bothered , got a full_refund and bought it off amazon .
0	the funny_thing is the original price i bought it for was £_00 right , i checked before i drove to the store , as i left the store i checked again to compare it '_s price to the one off amazon .
0	guess how much it is now ?
0	£_00 .
0	they upped the price just as i left the store .
0	maybe this isn_'_t a big deal to people but my advice is to stay_away from them .
0	they are conniving , horrible people .
0	i would happily pay £_00 + elsewhere for the same item .
0	cclonline will be informed about this review haha .
0	this is for the staff - i work security at hotels / bars etc .
0	i carry around a pin camera on my jacket button incase there is any trouble .
0	everything i have said in this review about the sighing and lazyness is all on tape .
0	obviously the phone one is only a voice recording but have fun guys .
0	i will be returning on the 00th which is my day off to complain to your manager and if he is unwilling to do something about this i will happily contact the corporate line to complain with proof .
0	have a nice day .
0	information i wanted was very clear and easy to find - location , pictures , travel advice / directions from airport .
0	simple process to find the best hostel
0	just do the shopping on your own .
0	they are , on average , 00 - 00_%_cheaper_than anyone_else .
0	shipping is fairly expensive , but it '_s outweighed_by the free_samples and gifts .
0	bought some supplements at 00_%_off , then got 0 shaker_bottles and 0 samples for just . 00 cents extra .
0	i think it '_s definitely worth the cost of a bit more shipping .
0	got my pre order key 0 days early along with saving £_00
0	the pc arrived much_faster_than i anticipated at an excellent price , everything was good until my graphics_card was showing major artifacts , i contacted cyberpower and they responded almost_instantly ( email ) and sent dpd the next_day to pick_up the card then the day after i had a new card , very quick service .
0	the new card i received was not working or even being detected it was brand_new though still in box , so i contacted cyberpower again , they responded almost_instantly again and suggested to send the pc back to see if something else was the problem .
0	dpd came the next_day and then took the pc , the day after to my horror i get an email_saying that the motherboard was damaged with pictures to prove it , i got angry because i was adamant that i had not damaged the motherboard and blamed them .
0	cyberpower were brilliant no matter_how annoyed or angry i got they dealt_with me professionally and calmly , they said that i could either wait to see if msi repair the motherboard or buy a new one from cyberpower and if the msi one gets repaired i '_ll be refunded .
0	i demanded a full_refund but i was denied ( wouldn_'_t blame them ) i gave in and bought a new motherboard then got a call saying that they would send my pc the next_day ( saturday ) it arrived working_perfectly with the same graphics_card that wasn_'_t even being detected before , so i was blaming cyberpower for something that they hadn_'_t even done but i '_m pretty sure i cant of broken it or maybe i did , nonetheless few_days_later i got an email_saying that msi repaired the motherboard and i will be refunded for the motherboard , ended_up with a better motherboard for free .
0	unfortunately that graphics_card also artifacted not cyberpowers fault it was still in the box brand_new , again got a replacement within 0 or 0 days but then that card even artifacted but no where near as bad , i wanted perfection though so they suggested a nvidia card and now i '_m going for a gtx_000 for a bit more money .
0	cant recommend cyberpower enough they sent me 0 free games for the inconvenience , with great service even after buying the product .
0	i didn_'_t even pay for professional wiring and they done it for free .
0	thank_you chris and gulam for putting up with me .
0	this electronics store seems to have everything and whats more is that nearly everything is always in stock too .
0	i found that three had a decent price for the iphone .
0	however the reception isn_'_t great in all areas .
0	the online billing services is fairly good .
0	overall a good service let_down by the network_coverage .
0	amazing range of awesome products .
0	urban_industry is my first stop for some new threads and kicks .
0	having been nearly ripped_off by a local car sales office , i found these at this great price .
0	have used kwik_fit before and will have no_hesitation using again & if you ' re any where in the anglia region jay who fitted my tires is a decent chap .
0	high_quality products at reasonable prices a delivery service that is second to none
0	in the last_year i '_ve sold 0 phones on mazuma and every_single service has_been great , prompt efficent and very helpful .
0	only one issue with pricing but that was a fault i had caused to the phone .
0	other than that happily_recommend their service .
0	ordered my lens on the thursday and it was delivered on the monday .
0	it was even quite exciting to see where my lens was in the world at various times using their tracking_system .
0	was nervous_about buying from outside the uk but everything_went well and will be ordering again soon .
0	eav made my shopping_experience extremely easy and provided me with lots of advice .
0	order turned_up fast .
0	thanks
0	i recently was on a mission to find tickets florence + machine concert at the o0 in december . tickets are sold out for the gig and i spent a while looking at tickets on websites of secondary ticket agents ... who were charging an ' arm and leg ' for the tickets and sometimes over £_00 of the face value .
0	i booked tickets through 00tickets . com even_though i had not purchased any tickets before .
0	the price was very reasonable and at centre stage .
0	which was what i was looking for .
0	i received the tickets in 00 days ( a month before the concert ) without_any trouble .
0	i ' d recommend 00tickets to anyone that is looking for a reliable service and a fair price .
0	cheers !
0	speedy payment , easy to use site .
0	would be nice if they had an i - phone app .
0	i have been with bt for many_years and although i had little problems with them , i find that it becomes more trouble when you are calling them .
0	you really need to be patient , and i am not that patient , as i hate to go through telephone systems , hence my 0_stars !
0	it feels good to be able to express ourselves sometimes !
0	nevertheless , their products are generally quality !
0	i am shopping to aldi regularily and i think it is an excellent company .
0	finished the mind_blowing range you can find at tesco where you end up buying more than you need .
0	with aldi , you go straight to the point , and the selection of product you find is tasty enough for me !
0	well_done !
0	good company , good honests and hard working people , and extremely_helpful .
0	i ordered many_times for my jewellery for my lip piercing , and my nipples , and the quality has always been there .
0	on top of that , i got it wrong a couple of times ( i am nopt very good with sizes ..) and they never created troubles or anything .
0	i could simply return my package , have a full_refund , or an exchange on one occasion .
0	i believe they actually make the body jewellery ( handy for special sizes !)
0	including the bioflex jewellery that they created , and from their advice for my lip piercing , i gathered that they are also piercers more into the passion for what they do and not here to make quick money .
0	often , i receive free extra jewellery with my order !
0	nice to know there are still some good people out there !
0	j - l
0	using the cv store was a serious wake_up call that my cv was poor and i was making glaring errors .
0	cv store is very quick on giving feedback and creating a new look .
0	my cv is now 000x better_than before - and the best feedback ?
0	many recruiters have told me that my cv was what got me the interview or that it was extremely well_presented and crafted .
0	well_worth the money .
0	i ordered a nikon_d0000 for £_000 .
0	it is a much_better price than anywhere_else i found in the uk or on - line .
0	delivery was quoted at around six days , but it only took three via_dhl where the order tracking was very good .
0	my bank initially refused payment by debit_card - so i had to call them to pr - authorise the transaction .
0	was surprised when i found out the goods were being shipped from spain , but they came through on time and as expected - and still cheaper_than i could_find elsewhere .
0	i bought simcity and some dlc from them which was much_cheaper_than amazon and anywhere_else at the time .
0	i received my key within 00 of ordering .
0	great site .
0	my declared dimensions were correct for the entire package .
0	i can prove that my dimensions were correct for this shipment .
0	as i said in my last e_mail to your customer_services i have photographic_evidence .
0	where is yours ?
0	i '_ve been looking for a good , but cheap dvd writer for my desktop since my last one packed up , and i didn_'_t need a blu - ray_player as i don_'_t use my desktop for that .
0	i found this lg after_googling for a while and ebuyer had the best price and free delivery too as a special , which made it even better .
0	i was genuinely_surprised that something under £_00 would be free delivery , never mind £_00 . 00 !
0	great experience , cheers !
0	i '_ve_used bc for ordering car and bike tyres .
0	the pricees for car tyres are fantastic , and thats even without considering the fitting cost is included .
0	nice to see more premier garages appearing too .
0	the motorbike tyre was the best price i could_find , and even with delivery cost was cheaper_than anywhere_else .
0	easy to use .
0	even when booking for the same day .
0	it just works
0	scope and mounts arrived bang on time , well_packaged and exactly as_discribed .
0	perfect service as always will be back and would recomend to anyone .
0	ordering was simple , as was payment , my item was dispatched quickly and arrived well_packaged and in perfect_condition .
0	i was emailed at every_step of the purchase as to what was happening and where my package was and what time it would arrive .
0	very good for me where i work nights .
0	over all extremely happy and will certsinly use again in the future .
0	in depth descriptions of all the products is very helpful , dispatch is fast and dpd are great at getting you your stuff on time .
0	will_certainly use them again .
0	needed a few large items shipped over from out the eu
0	but i needed them asap
0	so amazon contacted me to get my items delivered to my home
0	got my items delivered the day before i needed them
0	excellent customer_services
0	great service .
0	it the 0st time iv used parcel0go and what a great service .
0	i made an error when i book my collection which was sorted fast and with know problems by there online_chat helpline .
0	the young_lady ( leanne ) was great got me sorted_out in 0 minutes flat .
0	i will be using this service again in the future .
0	00 out of 00 .
0	probably the only company where you can find smith fuel v0 goggle range .
0	really pleased with dispatch options .
0	i recently_bought valkyrie profile 0 for the ps0 and it came very quickly !
0	the estimate on amazon was quite long but one of the staff_members send me an e_- mail saying to ignore it and they '_ll send it via_royal_mail 00 , and it arrived two_days_later .
0	very good condition , and it works_perfectly , even_though i was worried there would be some problems as my ps0 is quite old now !
0	will_definitely buy from them again !
0	i really like how fast they deliver .
0	you can track the progress of your delivery via the e_- mail you receive with parcel number and the tracking website is very clear .
0	it '_s also very useful when you '_ve missed the delivery that either they leave a calling_card to say where they have put the parcel safely or that you can go on the website and arrange a new delivery date .
0	i would certainly use the service for myself , as the company i ordered the parcels from have been using this .
0	i also really liked that the delivery drivers were friendly and to the point .
0	again .. brought a code from these_guys / gals and was instant and legit .
0	bf0_premium for £_00 instead of £_00 . 00 bargain !
0	00 / 00
0	i want to mention the excellent and prompt service , as well as james , alina and christina for their attention , care and professionalism !
0	i highly_recommend !
0	good luck to all of you , my friends !
0	good morning . i write to you from baku , azerbaijan .

0	i have always found that lidl have been good for people that like to shop for food & a few extra bits here & there on a budget there selection of meat it quite good ( in packets ofc ) and being a single guy with not that much time on his hands that suits be just fine .
0	the offers they have from time to time are good also but you always find that the stores near you either arnt running the offer or never get alot in of the products on offer .
0	either way im happy with shopping at lidl its shopping @ a budget with some nice products for the price .
0	no_complaints here , i have used nitrotek in the past with no_problems . the site is easy to use & it seems to have a better range of products that most other_sites ive been on , they even stock the parts for my xrc - 0 so i will be coming_back for more at some point !
0	order no .
0	000000000
0	cheers_guys !
0	i have purchased a number of items from alpkit and i have always been very happy with the price , speed of postage and after sales service .
0	i would recommend their down jackets to anyone , i have had years of service out of mine and it has lasted really well .
0	i also own a head_torch which in my opinion cannot be_beaten at the price point .
0	to top it all off they offer free_postage , not really sure how they do it for the price .
0	i purchased a pair of native boots from urban_industry .
0	the price was the cheapest i could_find on the web and they were offering free tracked delivery .
0	the boots turned_up 0 days after ordering and were very well_packed .
0	i can '_t fault the service and price , i would definitely order from them again and i would recommend them to others based on this experience .
0	hostelbookers is always the go - to site for hostel bookings .
0	easy - to - use website , great range of quality hostels , and cheaper_than the rest .
0	i '_ll always choose hostelbookers first !
0	used for a few_months now , never had any_problems and great prices !
0	i would fully recommend this professional_outfit .
0	repairs turned around quickly and hassle_free .
0	worth a go !
0	this website kills the competition !
0	by far the lowest_prices and biggest selection arround !
0	i will always order from here
0	never bother using them .
0	the slightest mistake cannot be rectified without costing you more than half what you paid .
0	do anything_else but use this pathetic_excuse for a company .
0	the staff were polite , but the best staff in the world can '_t save you from being chewed up and spat out by horrible business_practices .
0	well what can be said about alpharooms …..
0	fairly cheap ?
0	well yes .
0	but at the same time uncommunicable could also be said and '; you get what you pay for '.
0	mainly just one thing should be said in particular do not under any circumstance book with them !
0	i have never ever_dealt_with a more unprofessional company … don_'_t ruin your holiday for the sake of a few_pounds off .
0	it '_s honestly not worth it .
0	i made that mistake … twice .
0	neively originally booking a cheap trip to ibiza in 0000 where alpharooms placed us in a room with two single_beds ( after requesting a double ).
0	on our return i complained and received a 00_%_discount .
0	so seeing an opportunity for a cheaper trip i decided to use it on a trip to new_york with a transfer at reykjavic from london .
0	big_mistake .
0	not only did it take more than several phone_calls and emails to alpharooms to actually establish our travelling vouchers and baggage_allowance ( we were told two bags for the hold and then just one , then two again ..) encountering a range of ' customer sales representatives ( 0 out of 0 were english ), the rest were foreign who could barely understand , nor speak_english fluently themselves ( great idea for customer service placements ).
0	but when we finally arrived at the airport we were told curtly by the iceland air representative that the sales_person i ' d spoken to at alpharooms who ' d wished me and my girlfriend ' a happy holiday together ' had booked us several rows apart on all our flights !
0	he politely did his best to rectify this and booked us together on our main flight at the back of the plane to new_york from iceland - but for our 0 hour flight to iceland from london we were sat over 0 rows away .
0	my girlfriend was hugely distressed , especially as it was her_birthday too .
0	it was simply awful .
0	on our arrival in america i emailed and complained to alpharooms .
0	i received a curt reply saying they had ensured we were now seating with each other again on the journey back ( so admitting they had booked us apart ) but even more amazingly then then blamed me saying it was something they couldn_'_t guarantee and that it wasn_'_t their fault !
0	simply unbelievable
0	needless to say i came back and emailed them .
0	its taken a further 0 emails to finally get to a senior customer sales_representative .
0	they '_ve all rudely passed responsibility away from themselves .
0	so i '_m not seeking_legal_action_against them .
0	what kind of travel company decides to book a party of two several rows apart on a flight , after you '_ve stated you ' re travelling together .….
0	clearly not a proper one .
0	but operates by filling planes like buses with no thoughts to the customer .
0	please_please_please i implore you … give these_guys a wide_berth and go with well_known booking agents such as expedia , thomas_cook , trivago … anyone would be an improvement !
0	they ended_up pretty_much ruining two holidays , don_'_t make the same mistake we did !
0	_______________________________________________________________
0	my reply > to alpharooms reply_below
0	as you '_ll see alpharooms has since responded to this email in much the templated way that they contacted me when i raised these issues with them .
0	they '_ve done this on several review sites .
0	so for fear of any mistruths i '_ll simply state my reply here
0	___________________________________________________________
0	the simple matter of the fact is alpharooms , i did state we were travelling together , several_times .
0	so the fact you have the audacity to blame me for not specifying this ( when i did and your staff_member said ' oh that sounds nice ' before seeing fit to sit us several rows apart ) is sheer madness .
0	as i '_ve already stated i '_ve started legal support for this matter and i will be getting my money back .
0	along the way also ensuring that any other potential_customers don_'_t have to suffer in the way that i did with such a company as yours .
0	con no : zdbysw000000
0	i ordered a large_amount of furniture from home discount website .
0	i received an email from them on the 00st oct just at 00 : 00 saying they '_ve dispatched my goods , but it didn_'_t mention which courier .
0	on the 00nd , i contact home discount at 00 : 00 to try and find out the courier and they came back quickly saying it was xdp and gave_me a consignment_number which i looked up .
0	on the tracking_information , it said : 00 oct_0000 00 :_00am 000 delivery out for delivery - route 00 - eta : 00 :_00am to 0 :_00pm .
0	so i had to rush home from work , taking a taxi to get back in time , which cost me £ 0 and greatly irritating my boss .
0	getting home at 00 : 00 , i breathe a sigh of relief as the tracking_info stays the same , there '_s no card , so i sit_down to wait .
0	this was bad service because the company had not bothered to contact me to let_me know they were even delivering on this day .
0	so i sit .
0	and i wait .
0	00 : 00 goes by .
0	0 : 00 goes by - i am ringing to find out the problem but the phone is engaged .
0	engaged .
0	how on earth is not a proper phone system to taken calls ?
0	i am literally just ringing a landline .
0	ridiculous .
0	the girlfriend gets back at 0 : 00 so i taxi back to work for the afternoon ( another £ 0 ).
0	i continue calling and finally get someone at around 00 : 00 .
0	he tells_me that ' there has_been ' an incident ' in portsmouth ', so the van driver has decided to do his round backwards and to disregard the eta information .
0	that the delivery will be delivered by 0pm without_fail .
0	so from 0 : 00 onwards , with no delivery , i am watching that tracking_information like a hawk .
0	refreshing the window every 0 seconds .
0	at 0 : 00 , up comes the status 00 oct_0000 00 :_00pm all barcodes 000 exception carded .
0	i am running down the single flight of stairs to the front_door of my block of flats so fast it freaks my girlfriend out .
0	there is no card .
0	there is no delivery van .
0	there cannot be a card put through my door because there is no letterbox .
0	the delivery van has not visited my road because it is a no - through road which takes about 0 minutes of cautious reversing to get a taxi out , nevermind a delivery van .
0	so i ring the depot , there '_s no answer .
0	i leave a message explaining the issue .
0	it '_s strongly_worded but no shouting or swearing asking for someone to call me back .
0	it '_s now 0 :_00am on the 00rd oct and no - one has bothered to call me .
0	so yesterday , i was not contacted to be advised a delivery was taking place , the driver apparently decided to change his route and therefore failed to deliver it , and subsequently recorded a false entry in the database .
0	i am £_00 down , my boss is annoyed at me , my girlfriend has had to wait in all afternoon yesterday and again all day today , and i have not had a single communication from this company .
0	terrible , terrible service .
0	by contrast , dpd have been keeping_me appraised of another delivery of audio_equipment i ordered through amazon , just like they always do , and should be arriving today between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 , and i am sure they will - they usually call me 00_minutes before they are popping round .
0	currently , my consignment has this status 00 oct_0000 00 :_00am 000 delivery out for delivery - route 00 - eta : 0 :_00pm to 0 :_00pm .
0	i have absolutely no confidence this will arrive and my girlfriend has resigned herself to waiting in all day because we cannot trust this company .
0	used collectmyparcel . com a couple of times and had no_problems .
0	booked the day before and the collection has always been made on time .
0	excellent service all_round .
0	my go to company for parcel delivery .
0	great selection of brands and excellent customer service .
0	my new favorite supplement website .
0	i normally used booking . com to find hostels but on the recommendation of a friend i used hostelbookers . com and cannot_believe_how awesome it is !
0	their service is top - notch and the booking process through them is very easy to get the hang of .
0	their listing functions provide practical and cheap options which is great for me because i hardly need a 0 - star treatment for a 0 - 0 night stay .
0	it really is the go - to booking service when out and about !
0	great radiator delivered at a great price - really impressed with the website , range and prices .
0	thanks very much , oli
0	easy to use website , great price and quick delivery .
0	many_thanks .
0	the shower came out very quickly , communication was great and the finished product is excellent .
0	the website was clear and easy to use , choice and prices were very good .
0	recommended .
0	i chose worktop_express based on their reviews and i wasn_'_t disappointed .
0	the product was delivered exactly when they said they would by 0 very helpful guys .
0	on the phone the customer service was great , they answered my numerous questions .
0	the worktop itself is beautiful - the staves are thick and the quality of the finish is excellent .
0	the fitters had no problem in putting it in .
0	price smashed everything else i saw - specifically homebase and b_& q , but also ikea .
0	the quality is also far better_than the samples i saw of these 0 .
0	worktops do require complete oiling , but worth doing to pick your own finish .
0	000_% recommended - thank_you !
0	thoroughly
0	putting time and effort into picking the right product and supplier will always pay off in the end .
0	we purchased our new dishwasher from appliance_planet after_reading great reviews on both the appliance and the supplier ’_s website .
0	the dishwasher was rated the best integrated_dishwasher on which ?
0	and was fantastic value for money at the £_000 mark .
0	i initially went to the website for price , but it was the customer service and ease of use purchase that sealed it for me .
0	once i was on the website , the range of products nearly got me to change my mind but i stuck with my original choice .
0	the website was clear and very simple to use .
0	the search functionality on the website was intuitive and most_importantly the prices were incredibly competitive .
0	the customer service over the phone was fantastic , my call was quickly answered and they were very helpful and knowledgeable about the product – able to answer_questions on spec and discuss delivery logistics with authority – and in fact i finally placed the order over the phone .
0	there was no upselling or extended_warranty annoyingness of calling currys - or another online_retailer who called me back after a purchase to ask me if i wanted a longer guarantee - just clear impartial_advice .
0	the delivery process was efficient and reliable – they would even do a free saturday delivery if we needed ; they called me to confirm delivery dates and were very flexible .
0	i chose delivery for a date quite a long time in advance and they were able to assist .
0	i received a text_message reminding_me of the order arrival and the delivery guys were really helpful and very accommodating on quite a tough delivery .
0	the dishwasher , siemens sn00m000gb , itself is brilliant .
0	the kitchen fitters were able to install it quickly and easily .
0	the machine takes a large load for it size .
0	the clean is fantastic every time , even dried on cereal comes off .
0	we adjusted the top racks for our big plates which was thankfully easy to do – our last machine didn_’_t have that functionality .
0	oddly it doesn_’_t dry our tupperware very well – but this is my only complaint to date !
0	to sum_up i would thoroughly_recommend the website and will be buying any appliances through them in future .
0	thanks guys !
0	great product and more inmportantly price - delivered safely and quickly
0	great website , great prices , really good service and quick delivery .
0	thoroughly_recommended
0	a great experience , great product and great price .
0	many_thanks for the help , advice and service
0	do not ever use this company .
0	it is terrible .
0	customer service is as bad as none_existant , i paid an extra £ 0 to get it delivered in 0 - 0 business days , it has_been 00 days and still not come !
0	brilliant !
0	monster_supplements , offer a great range of products all at far lower prices than available in the high_street or indeed almost anywhere_else online .
0	any_issues are resolved quickly by friendly and helpful staff .
0	they ship fast and often add free_gifts to regular customers , all in all an a0 company !
0	works like a charme , saves 00_% of cost and experience is super smooth , especially for a repeat usage .
0	great range of high_quality products at good prices and everything i need for my sign making business all in one place .
0	nevada sorted a little mistake that the couriers had made super quick , ill definitely use nevada again .
0	i desperately_needed some new work trousers ( i '_m heating_engineer ) so i had a quick look online and having had dickies stuff before i felt_confident about the quality .
0	i ordered them late yesterday and they turned_up a lunch time today ( which is a saturday !)
0	i really wasn_'_t expecting them to turn_up until monday due to late friday order so amazing delivery / ordering_process .
0	also i have short ass little legs and was so happy that i managed to get trouser the right length so that the knee_pads were actually knee_pads not shin_pads !
0	haha .
0	all_round great service .
0	extremely happy .
0	i got an amazing price for my new laptop , it arrived when they said .. i even got a text_telling_me which hour it would come and the name of the driver which i wasn_'_t expecting .
0	after so many nightmares and disasters with other online_retailers this was such a relief , i would happily use studentcomputers again and have already_recommended them to others .
0	=)
0	i contacted ttb to arrange a static_ip_address , which was done with no_fuss and was working before i ' d finished the chat .
0	i then asked for a ptr record to be setup , and was although i was passed over to someone_else for that to happen , he read over the chat , confirmed the ip_address and the hostname , and arranged the ptr setup there and then .
0	very helpful , and i thank the two individuals concerned for their time and efforts .
0	this is the best place i have came to find to buy supplements .
0	they have the best prices you will find any where with a wide_variety to chose from .
0	will match any price .
0	helps save tons of money
0	i tried signing_up for talk_talk home phone and broadband and got booted off the line 0 times .
0	i gave up .
0	my nan was unfortunate_enough to get through and sign up and she '_s had problem after problem and also reports the customer service is lousy .
0	they may claim to be cheap but i would recommend anyone to ...
0	avoid at all costs !
0	i love google , although i think android is a bit of a grey_area as i had an android that was faulty after 0 months .
0	i use google apps for business and it '_s brilliant , i also google for my personal mail , maps , documents and so on .
0	i really recommend google apps for business to any sme .
0	sound went on my htc_desire , called htc and they didn_'_t want to know .
0	i went and got an iphone 0 and now have the 0s and no issues .
0	not impressed !
0	truly_amazing .
0	for everything you want and great customer service , there '_s only one place i go .
0	i '_ve_used parcel0go so many_times i '_ve lost_count and each and every time the customer service i '_ve experienced has_been amazing .
0	i '_ve imported items from the us , shipped ebay items around the world and sent domestic packages across the uk without_any hassle_whatsoever .
0	this company really know how to look after me and with updates on twitter and facebook , it '_s great to know i can get hold of someone if i have any questions about tracking or general questions .
0	a special_mention has to go to kate and george who go the extra_mile .
0	thanks guys !
0	parcel0go also run competitions which is great because i hardly_ever win anything but it at_least gives me hope .
0	i also think they ' re great value for money ( a 0 day courier which usually_arrives in a day anyway for about £ 0 - brilliant !)
0	and the ease of use of their website plus google_checkout / paypal for payment is so easy even a child could do it .
0	i thoroughly and wholeheartedly_recommend parcel0go to anybody looking for a trustworthy and reliable courier agent .
0	they ' re my courier agents of choice and i won_'_t be using anybody_else .
0	thank_you very much ,
0	after paying and sending a foto of my credit_card ( with numbers covered ) it took them about 00_hours to deliver the unlock .
0	happy with everything .

0	one feels valued by the company .
0	a pleasure to deal with .
0	excellent , first_class , delivery spot on choice of good fantastic , defiantly a class company that will be used again , many_thanks karl and team
0	not only does supplementwarehouse . com offer their 0 %_off any competitor '_s price , the free_samples make ordering from the site well_worth it .
0	other company '_s limit the amount of samples , but sw has no limit , a huge_selection , and unique offers like magazine_subscriptions .
0	a great buy and awesome service !
0	selling my old_mobile through mazuma was quick and easy .
0	best of all it was the best price available !
0	i got my cheque through the post within a day of them receiving my phone .
0	well impressed !
0	a very competitive company to deal with .
0	great deals and great service from chillisauce .
0	from the onset our site was set_up ready to use , no_hassle and no issues .
0	activities were great , location and directions given .
0	hotel was more than adequate too .
0	many_thanks for taking the pressure off of the stag and the groomsmen most of all !
0	thanks again .
0	dedicated service to get you the best deal .
0	from postage to payment , no_problems at all .
0	thanks .
0	as i guess most people are , i was a little_dubious at first when a friend recommended this site to me .
0	i through i ' d pay through paypal in case i had any_problems and managed to get 0 . 0 %_off for getting the code and liking them on facebook .
0	once i ' d received the e_- mail a valid code was delivered in next to no time and that '_s it , done .
0	i recommend for value and simplicity and i will_definately_use again , yet another happy customer !
0	they regularly don_'_t turn_up for collections or delivery and claim some useless excuse like ' there was nowhere to park ' or ' there was no response '.
0	they would have to actually attempt delivery in order to realise the fact that there is an almost permanently empty parking_space on my drive and the road is wide enough with no markings to pull up for a prolonged period .
0	on top of this , my workplace is on a business park with enough space to pull up , let_alone park , for an entire football_team .
0	they claim all_sorts of excuses but fail to realise that all the delivery locations i have specified have cctv so can easily prove that they are lying .
0	it is only because of the suppliers that these issues have been sorted .
0	how can a company with such a poor reputation from across the country detailed so much on the internet possibly receive business ?
0	cost .
0	pay_peanuts ...
0	i can however say one thing , they are consistent , but it is consistently useless .
0	i had an issue with an item arriving broken , without_delay a replacement was sent and arrived a few_days_later .
0	the product is fantastic as well both in terms of value for money and taste .
0	whilst i know the supplements are expensive it has lasted_longer_than i expected and i am seeing good results .
0	i would highly_recommend maximuscle . com to others wanting good products coupled_with great service .
0	i ordered some ray - bans on the 00st of july_0000 with the promise of there 0 - 00 days delivery by the 00st of august i still had not received the glasses !
0	i first contacted them around the 0th of august wanting answers as to when my glasses would be delivered i received no reassurance all i got was something completely_different that didn_'_t answer any questions !
0	they couldn_'_t even guarantee that my glasses would even turn_up !
0	they should at_least state that all orders are drop shipped !
0	so i promise you this smartbuy sunglasses ( not very smart at all ) you haven_'_t heard the last of me !
0	i will be taking this further !
0	i have only recently received the refund which seemed doubtful at the time !
0	so order from this company if you want to order from a company which is registered and hosted in australia , the stock comes from_hong_kong and they have a uk unit where the returns are sent to !
0	who don_'_t even have a contact number just a pre_- recorded_message which just irritates me even more !
0	poor_excuse for a business !
0	bad_practice and even worse customer service !
0	i went and bought the sunglasses from a opticians that sell them !
0	and i sugest others do the same for the sake of £_00 it isn_'_t worth the risk !
0	we wanted a ford_mustang for are florida trip in 0000 we asked if we could put it that we have requested a ford_mustang using usrentacar with dollar when we got to florida dollar said they got are request from usrentacar and they have the mustang waiting for us so we could not recommend usrentacar enough
0	we are also going to use them again for are dec_0000 trip back to florida
0	i think 00 . co . uk is a great site , always offering bonuses and 00 . co . uk doesnt just take your deposit , like most sites i gamble on they take my deposit and im gone within 0 minutes .
0	full of bally games and all the popular igt games .
0	they offer a 000_% first deposit match and most weeks you get an email with a code for free money that you can use to play a newly_released game .
0	i don_'_t usually like refering or recommending sites to other people but id recommend 00 . co . uk to anyone !
0	!
0	ok casino but like all gamesys sites it can be very unfair !
0	most times my deposits are gone within 0 - 00_minutes .
0	they offer a daily free game which used to be good .
0	no matter what i used to have atleast 00 free_spins a week but after a while it stopped giving me them .. i had a couple of months cool off and started depositing again but it '_s now been 00 weeks since i won on the daily free game .
0	makes you not want go go on when your losing your deposits most times and not getting anything back like free_spins .
0	casino '_s need to think more about their players and not just the money thats coming in .
0	a little something back is always nice .
0	i rate this casino 0 / 00
0	used to be my # 0 casino to make deposit '_s but my experience suddenly changed !
0	after a while virgin_games just stopped paying out on the slot machines , every deposit made was just gone within 00_minutes if that !
0	they also have a daily free game you can do and collect eggs till the end of the month for guaranteed free_spins and / or cash but you only ever get 0 egg which = a spin .
0	i used to get atleast 0 free_spins a week but now when i do my free games it '_s mostly no wins and i '_ve not had free_spins for a while now .
0	i deceided to take a cool off from the site at the start of the year as the chat_host i was speaking too was very rude and unprofessional .
0	i complained on the last day of the month ( monthly game that offers guaranteed spins or cash ) that i wasn_'_t winning on the free games and it had been a while since i won off virgin even after all the deposits made .. other members and the chat_host '_s posts were nasty and it was like they was all telling_me to just go !
0	my last reply was " virgin_games has just lost themselfs a regular depositing player " and the chat_host '_s reply was " ok , see you tomorrow " like i just come on for the free games ?
0	i '_ve recently started doing my free games again and it '_s been 0 - 0_weeks .
0	i have still not had my free_spins yet , so .. since my cool off , nothing has changed .
0	i will_continue to make deposit '_s on virgin_games but not like i used too !
0	i have disabled chat so i don_'_t have to deal with any chat_host '_s anymore !
0	virgin_games needs to get_rid of chat_host '_s .
0	the only chat_host that took her job seriously was esme but she has_gone now .
0	i think virgin_games needs to update there casino more often and offer better bonuses like deposit matches and free_spins for new game releases , just a pound bonus puts a smile on everybody '_s face !
0	there is casino '_s online now that make you want to deposit on that site ... virgin_games just dont offer that .
0	great website , fast payment , as promised and totally secure .
0	well_worth a try if you have a laptop lying_around collecting_dust !
0	give it a go now .
0	cheers
0	never had an issue .
0	fast shipping and love the 0 %_off the lowest competitor price you can find !
0	!
0	they have routinely left very expensive parcels on my door_step .
0	have left parcels with neighbours but not put the correct information on the note , and on on occasions when a parcel was left apparently left on the door_step , but wasn_'_t there when i got home , they had no record of who the parcel had been sent by on their system .
0	if you are a retailer please have more respect for your customers than to use this service .
0	i can '_t fault twe , always delivered on time and well_packaged .
0	the only time i have had reason to return an item the customer service was fine .
0	they arranged to collect the item and i had a replacement within a week .
0	the price quoted for 0 phones was the best i could_find anywhere .
0	i received the prepaid_bag within a couple of days and the money in my bank a few_days after_posting the phones back .
0	not much else i can say other than it was very simple .
0	next_day delivery was very cheap and the product i was after was still the cheapest including delivery .
0	had no issues with the site and the product was packaged extremely well .
0	where would we be without you !
0	they are good at providing information and tirned up on time .
0	but the guys who delivered our sofa refused to unpack it and take the cardboard away as was part of the deal when we bought them .
0	we contacted the seller and they made yodel come_back to collect the rubbish .
0	nice design , simple to use .
0	i '_ve got 00 staff and this will save us a whole heap of time .
0	very quick and easy service , just put in your details , put in your phone details and a few_days_later you '_ll get an email_confirming the unlock is complete with easy to follow_instructions on how to complete the process :) thank_you :)
0	if i was referring anyone to buy from a record store it would easily be juno_records !
0	its not just records that they sell , they cover equipment , cd '_s , downloads , clothing , record players amongst_others but it is one thing for a shop to have the goods and its another to treat there customers well and juno_records certainly does just that , with great prices , quick shipping and great quality items juno_records is the only record store in my opinion !
0	i stumbled_across site by mistake on google .
0	ended_up buying more than i was looking for .
0	items delivered extremely quickly .
0	very , very impressed .
0	will be using regularly from now on .
0	great price and fast delivery from_hong_kong
0	really easy to use website , great prices , service and quick delivery - perfect online sales - definitely my first choice for sports gear from now on .
0	i just got an upgrade from my phone provider & had a scratched & dusty old 0 .
0	i got my new phone & stuck the old 0 in my drawer .
0	a friend at work said i should sell it to mazuma .
0	i looked up the price & the phone was fully_functioning so seemed a waste not to at_least try .
0	honestly it was so easy !
0	i signed_up online & gave all my details & requested a pre_- paid_envelope for my phone ( this was the longest part of the process ) a day later i got the ennvelope !
0	i deleted all my stuff from my old phone , cleaned it down & sent it off .
0	i got an email a day later from mazuma ( communication is fantastic !)
0	to let_me know they had recieved it and the next_day i had £_00 in my account !
0	i have used mazuma twice since , once for another working handset & once for an ancient phone which was broken .
0	this totalled another £_00 direct into my bank_account !
0	exact_same experience .
0	i would reccommend to anyone .
0	quicker_than cashing a cheque !
0	brillient product ... officially a lord :) bank , credit_cards everything even nectar card :) very pleased : d
0	company is very helpful and professional , i was selling my imac and the at first i thought ebay .. prices for a mint_condition imac were very bad .
0	but i found cash my gadget on a google_search and wow good price and super friendly service :)
0	00 / 00
0	good product selection at a good price with some good deals , worth looking out for not many internet shops i trust but this is one of them
0	very impressed , in stock , cheaper and very fast and free delivery !
0	dropped into stoneacre on wheatley hall road with the intention of just having a look around when after about 00 / 00_minutes was greeted buy a salesman ( tony illudge ).
0	usually i try to avoid the salesman until i need to actually speak to one , however i found tony '_s customer service brilliant , very direct talked no_nonsense and told me all i needed to know , talking to him was like talking to a guy in the street and not an overbearing salesman like at perry '_s were i had been previous and felt the need to run away after 0 minutes which was refreshing .
0	all in all from the original viewing of the car , test_drive and finance meeting to picking it up it only took three_days , would of been less if i had been able to get to the dealers earlier on in the days instead of 0 hour before closure .
0	tony kept me updated_throughout the whole_process .
0	i would seriously advise anyone of my friends and family to purchase a car from them in the future as i know i will be .
0	i have bought several items fro hennie '_s all were sent immediately .
0	i ordered the wrong item this was no trouble for them .
0	thoroughly_recommended .
0	bought suunto watch .... great price .
0	standard delivery chosen , item arrived next_day !
0	opened the box , had a question ...... phoned the company
0	question was answered there and then , with a follow_up e_- mail to confirm
0	i was happy ... where else on the net does that happen then >?
0	?
0	this is my second time ordering my supplements from sw !
0	great prices and fast shipping .
0	i don_'_t se emyself ordering my protein_shakes anywayere else .
0	i ordered a bunch of 00 roses to be delivered on valentines_day for the missus .
0	price was competitive not amazingly cheap , they arrived on time on valentines_day in a large box .
0	the missus opened the box to find 00 roses , 0 of which were broken and one which didn_'_t have a head and nor was the head in the box meaning that the rose must have been headless when they put them in there !
0	i complained and was assured that this is not the usual quality of their products , they sent out a new set .
0	when we received the new set we again only received 00 roses which all looked like the cheapest battered roses money could buy .
0	another complaint and 0_weeks_later i am still_waiting for my money .
0	my advice - don_'_t use them at all costs more hassle than its worth , get friendly with a local_florist same - day delivery and two_weeks_later the flowers still look amazing all for only £ 0 dearer_than iflorist !
0	i ordered with this company for the first time and was told that my items would be received by 00 december at the latest .
0	they never arrived and i contacted asos who intially did nothing .
0	then i got an e_- mail saying my order had been returned to them and queried why i hadn_'_t completed the returns_slip !
0	i was then told that my order would be cancelled and if i wanted the items i had to re - order them but they are now out of stock .
0	i asked if they could send the item that they sent originally and was told they could not do that !
0	the item was a christmas_present ( which i made them aware of ) and now i have to find an_alternative at the last_minute .
0	having never rented a property out before and becoming a landlord for the first time , i came_across openrent . co . uk and found their service both efficient and simple to use .
0	my property was listed on all the major websites within 0 working hours and my property was rented within 00_hours of signing_up to openrent . co . uk
0	i would definitely recommend this service and will use it again in the future .
0	i '_ve never used simply_games before , but i am_glad i did .
0	not only did my game arrived fast the price is also outstanding .
0	highly_recommended for those who spend quite a bit on games regularly .
0	will_definitely buy from you again .
0	the product was delivered on time , packaging was good .
0	gift_wrapping was perfect , will use service again
0	adzuna ist ein " google " für arbeit suchen .
0	ich fand meine arbeit mit_der suchmaschine .
0	danke !
0	got a fender_stratocaster and a ibanez hollow body ( which i bought there ) set_up .
0	had it done within the week , incredibly affordable price and an excellent job_done .
0	after waiting years for an iphone ( only because i could not justify the high price that o0 had forced upon the british_public for so long ) along comes three with an incredible deal .
0	contrary to public perception , the signal_coverage is excellent , with me rarely going without a speedy 0g connection .
0	my friend recommended me to the site after i had tried other protein drinks from high_street_stores .
0	not only is myprotein . co . uk considerably_cheaper then the high_street , it tastes a lot better and feels_like a lot better quality than the high_street brands .
0	on top of that , the delivery time was astonishing .
0	i '_m telling all my friends about myprotein . co . uk , 0_star service and products !
0	i purchased a set of 00 " bbs chr black alloys for my mk0 vw_golf and could not be_happier .
0	i got them at the cheapest price i could_find on the internet with free delivery .
0	my sales_rep cormac answered any questions i had and does his job in an efficient and professional_manner .
0	the result is a very happy customer who would happily use performance_alloys again and recommend them to anyone .
0	i recently_purchased a dell multifunction laser_printer from printerland . co . uk .
0	not only were they the best price by quite some_margin , but they included free delivery and an after sales service to put larger companies very much to shame !
0	superb service from_start to finish , would highly_recommend this company and i will_definitely be using them again .
0	very fast delivery , great price , would definately_use them again .
0	great weekend in chester , started with quad_biking at catton hall , which was a good laugh !
0	in the afternoon we did a pub treasure_hunt , this was great fun and set the rest of the days drinking up well !
0	the chillisauce_organised activities were fun to take part in , would recommend them to all stag_do organisers !
0	if your fone brakes id send it to bozowi i sent mine and got my money straight_away was very pleased with the service i received
0	very happy with wiggle .
0	have used you guys a couple of times now and can '_t speak highly_enough of your customer service .
0	great prices , easy to navigate website , kept me up to date with my speedy delivery and some haribo in the box as well !
0	couldn_'_t ask for a better company .
0	thank_you .
0	bad communication
0	slow delivery
0	average value
0	wish i could give a good rating but sadly , in this case , i can '_t .
0	overall a very bad customer experience .
0	great company , with a superb service !
0	a rare find these days .
0	a pleasure .
0	requested a boiler estimate first thing friday_morning and by 0pm the same day my old boiler had disappeared and a brand_new one installed .
0	nick_quilter provided a brilliant service and is clearly an expert in his trade .
0	i will happily use pimlico and nick again for big jobs like this .
0	they may not be the cheapest but some things are worth spending a bit more money on for that extra quality .
0	been waiting for my delivery for over a week now .
0	after hours spent speaking with yodel customer_support who stated that the address was wrong , when it couldn_'_t have been more correct ( we had included every piece of info possible ).
0	they made an attempt last night at 0pm to a very clear business address !?
0	!
0	now sat here waiting for another attempt , but judging on the time i am not expecting it to arrive .
0	what a waste of time .
0	bought a brush set for my girlfriend for her_birthday .
0	she was over the moon and said it was the best collection of makeup brushes she has owned .
0	would recommend !
0	i had been looking for a pair of prada_sunglasses for my girlfriend for weeks only to find blaze had them instock .
0	i called the number on the site and was pleasently_suprised to speak to someone so knowledgable and helpful .
0	the sunglasses were sent to me with free next_day delivery in time for my girlfriends_birthday .
0	blaze made purchasing online easy as i am not familiar with purchasing through the internet .
0	will_definitely recommend to all my friends and family .
0	been buying from myprotein for a few_years_now .
0	love the products and they never dissapoint .
0	sainsbury '_s prices are very reasonable , and their ' basics ' range has the same standards of quality as their normal products , but they have more relaxed rules on size and shape .
0	if they do not have something that you ordered in stock , they are very sensible about what they give you as a replacement .
0	should you still not be satisfied , they refund you the item and sometimes even let you keep it .
0	the website is very helpful , as you can not only sort through all the categories , but you can sort through all the different_categories based_upon what is on offer , so you can save a lot of money !
0	for the entire duration of my time with t - mobile they have sought to resolve each and every issue i have ever had .
0	now don_'_t let this fool you into thinking that there are lots of problems with them , every company has a few kinks .
0	the first problem i had was a lack of signal - a month later the merger with orange was announced , and soon after i was able to use orange signal too .
0	when i found a cheaper deal with o0 , t - mobile not only offered me a deal that was far better_than the one i had found , but also reduced their price for new customers so as not to be_beaten .
0	they have incredibly friendly staff , very reasonably prices , and the booster_packs are brilliant .
0	overall , this is the best phone network i have been with , and i '_ve been with all the major ones in my time .
0	mazuma offered a great price for my phone , got the pre_- paid_envelope out to me in no time , processed the phone almost_immediately after receiving it and paid me the next_day .
0	excellent =)
0	very good conditions , fast 0 day shipment to germany , nice contact
0	when i moved_into my property in december_0000 i looked around for the cheapest tarrifs .
0	first_utility came up on price comparison_websites so i chose to stay with this company .
0	i am now getting statements for an overdue payment for when i didn_'_t live in the property , when i spoke to fu i was advised to ignore any statements for the dates from july - november_0000 which i have done .
0	when i recieved statements showing how much my balance was it turns_out they were still billing me for these months .
0	i have had to send in copys of my tenancy_agreement and also covering_letters and was told somebody would get in touch but still nothing has_been resolved .
0	this has_been gogoing on for months now and it is a complete_joke .
0	when i phoned them to see if they habe received my cheque i was told this they didn_'_t accept cheques by 0 advisor bit was advised by somebody_else that i could pay by this method .
0	i have also had problems submitting meter_readings to fu and when i have managed to do this they " havent " recieced them .
0	can '_t wait to pay off my bill and move to a respectable company .
0	i now have my gas supplied by n - power and i have to say the staff there are so helpful and understanding i can '_t wait to have my electric supplied by them . avoid fu phoned fu today 00 / 00 / 00 and have been on the phone for over 0 hours trying to sort_out their diabolical mistakes .
0	after been passed from pillar to post and been told that they don_'_t have an account for me i have to ask
0	0 , if there is no account and i don_'_t exist on their system , why the hell am i receiving bills ?
0	0 , why can 0 person find me then other people can '_t .
0	i mean for god sake the only thing u didn_'_t ask me for was blood .
0	0 , why get me angry then try arugeing with me down the phone .
0	when all i wanted to do is sort_out this ridiculous account .
0	don_'_t take it out on me if your having a bad day !!
0	!
0	0 , why do i need to be transferred to a change of tenancy department when i moved in to my property nearly 00 months_ago when all this was done in december_0000 ?
0	?
0	this service is the worst i have received by any means .
0	this company needs shutting_down if all they do is rip people off .
0	sick of fu completely now .
0	i would recommend people to stay_away from this company unless u enjoy getting poor customer service and incorrect bills .
0	wouldn_'_t it be good if this company was on don_'_t get done get dom !!!
0	wander how they would try and cover that up .
0	service was excellent , customer service was excellent , delivery time again excellent , quality you guessed it excellent
0	satisfied with the all services provided .
0	raised an issue via trustpilot , had contact from magic_madhouse who offered a resolution .
0	will be using again .
0	will use again , good product and price .
0	fantastic customer service !
0	what more can be said than great service , great delivery times and free p_&_p .
0	highly_recommended .
0	order no :_000000000
0	plane arrived well_packaged and delivered next working week day as specified on ordering , customer_support via_email was quick and helpful , thanks thomas .
0	recommended
0	very undecided if home learning would be for me .
0	it is harder ( obviously ) and does require a lot more time and dedication then classroom teacher but on the plus_side you are your own boss and you can work on your own time .
0	really like ncc home learning , would use again .
0	just some of the quickest and most reliable service i have ever_experienced online .
0	i '_ve had a few issues over the last few_days with changing addresses and cancellations and i must_say , emma and elizabeth have been absolutely amazing with their help on the live_chat .
0	i am a strong believer in good customer_care and yours in second to none .
0	thank_you for all your help parcel0go . com :) without you box frame canvas_prints would not run so well
0	nespresso ( coffee_machines ) have unfortunately chosen these_clowns for their warranty repair pick_up service !
0	first , i had to listen to their pick_up man effing and jeffing for at_least a minute as he could perform the simple operation of opening a plastic box .
0	he then took my coffee_machine , ragging it around with no care as he tried to shove it in the box .
0	after ( he ) trapping my finger as i tried to help the imbecile close the box , i endured a further minute of his profanities .
0	0_weeks_later , with no forewarning ( this i blame nespresso for ), they attempted to redeliver on the 00rd of february .
0	they also slipped another card ; they claimed had been for the day before through the door .
0	i know they had only attempted the delivery once as the one dated the 00nd , they had left the barcode tear off at the bottom of the card ( they would normally scan this and take it away to prove their driver had attempted delivery ).
0	this meant they had saved money by not having to attempt re - delivery the next_day .
0	i tried to call , but their " award_winning call_centre ” phone line , said there " was a fault ".
0	as it was out of their office hours , unlike the phone line was saying , i was unable to speak to a member of their team .
0	i went online ; their website also said there was a fault .
0	the next_day , i called .
0	i followed the automated_system for collection .
0	it gave_me the option of thu / fri / sat / mon for collection .
0	none of these days were possible due to work / commitments .
0	as the card said the item would be returned after 0 working_days , i felt under_pressure to commit to a collection date .
0	i went online to see if i could_find an address for the local_depot - nothing .
0	i found a number for their customer_services - after 00_minutes queuing , i realised none of the call_centre awards were for efficiency and gave up to continue with my day .
0	later on , i found a list of depot addresses and phone numbers ( from a complaints website , listed by a distressed customer ).
0	i called them the next_morning .
0	the man i spoke to said he could only look into this if i had my consignment_number ( i find this hard to believe that a delivery company can '_t find you from an address ) but fair_enough , i thought i ' d take number with me to work the next_day .
0	i called next_day with the number " no , we ' re just a depot , we don_'_t deal with collections , i '_ll put you through ” i was put through to a lady , who said " i '_ll put you through to customer_services ".
0	another 00_minutes on hold , during my break , i gave up .
0	it was now friday so we went away for the weekend and have just returned .
0	i tried the phone system again hoping now the pickup dates available will have shifted forward " please hang on while i transfer you to a member of our team ... sorry , our opening_hours are monday to ..." i then logged on to the website to try and sort .
0	this threw up the result ' your package has_gone for re - delivery '.
0	i suspect it has_been returned to nespresso - dpd will no doubt charge for this and charge for nespresso to re - deliver .
0	a shocking attempt to make money out of their large contracts .
0	this is basic stuff .
0	royal_mail leaves a card telling you where your package is and how to collect it .
0	i intend to call nespresso on monday and complain_about this appalling company .
0	the person_who gave them a 0_star_rating ; possibly severely mentally impaired or a dpd employee ( or perhaps both )!
0	seriously though , i have never felt so strongly before that i have felt it worth taking up my time to warn_others of such poor service – beware !!
0	!
0	not only did i purchase cod_ghosts at a great price , it was delivered in 0 days with no issues .
0	i have ordered from sw several_times now as well as some other_sites .
0	i find myself coming_back here every time now .
0	the customer service is friendly and i know i '_m getting the best deal out there .
0	even more so with the price match .
0	i have been shopping for supplements on musclefinesse for about a year and i can_honestly_say that its been a dream come true for my body_building needs ...
0	shipment comes the next_day and i never have any hassle as they are always fully stocked with everything i need !
0	i give it 0_star , aaa plus !
0	!
0	as the last time i used ukmail to buy an apple product , the status will show fail to deliver .
0	i was staying at home all day waiting for them , no calls no bells .. after they " fails to deliver " three_days , i visited them personally and got my parcel ,... this time they sent me a message said it will be delivered between 0 : 00 to 00 : 00 ..
0	i waited another morning , obviously i '_m being stupid again .
0	nothing delivered .
0	i decided to go out and do my own business at 00 : 00 , when i '_m away from my home , the mailman called me at around 00 , asking me to go out to the gate for the parcel , i was in a rush running back home he showed a massive impatient and unfriendly face to me .
0	got the money transferred immediately when they receive my laptop with the same price i quoted which is really important
0	bought a shirt for my prom on the site came within 0 day with free delivery !, very pleased and satisfied .
0	i will_definitely use asos again !
0	hands_down the best supp site ..... they will match any price that you find on the internet .
0	they do not have free shipping but their prices are so low you still end up saving money ....
0	highly_recomended !
0	amazed to begin with at the speed of which my order came !
0	tastes great , good quality and great price !
0	too soon to tell if i '_m getting results , but i ' d expect to see some in another 0 - 0_weeks !
0	the websites information is perfect for making_sure your getting the correct product for your goal .
0	and it '_s always good to see other_peoples reviews of the products to get a ' real persons ' idea of what the product is like !
0	i would definately recommend these_guys !
0	they make beautiful quality rings , they were helpful and friendly from the begining and fast with their service and feedback !
0	i bought my girlfriends_engagement_ring from these_guys and will be buying our_wedding_rings here too !
0	purely_because of such an excellent service !
0	nikki of ec0000 was great , she was able to resolve my account problem within a minute or two ..
0	she was able to explain clearly why i am having a problem with my account all while being polite & courteous ...
0	best prices on the market no wonder i get recomended it so much by freinds this website is one of a kind
0	wonderful search_engine
0	i have good price for air ticket
0	right choice
0	very helpful and polite .
0	give her the prize !
0	easy to use and reliable .
0	order the titanfall origin_key and had validation within minutes paying through paypal .
0	will use again and would definitely recommend .
0	i have been waiting for 00_minutes now to speak to someone in customer_services .
0	this company is absolutely abysmal .
0	the item arrived the morning after i ordered it !
0	didn_'_t have to use customer service centre so can '_t rate it .
0	the item was 00 pounds_cheaper_than it was in the north_face website .
0	very pleased with the product and service .
0	i will_definitely recommend it to others .
0	ordered a sealey jump start pack .
0	arrived two_days after purchase via_dpd courier .
0	courier service used was great .
0	i was able to track my package in real time .
0	the item was well taped_up and inculded an ffx catalogue .
0	opened the package to inspect contents .
0	everything else was there except the all important mains_charger .
0	a quick message to ffx ensured one was sent out very quickly .
0	messages were also replied to promptly .
0	mains_charger turned_up .
0	so all in all very happy with purchase from this supplier whom i have never used before .
0	i first heard of mattressman on a popular search_engine .
0	as i was in desperate_need of a new mattress i had a look on their website and was astonished at their huge_range .
0	all_sorts of mattresses were on offer here .
0	i bought my old mattress from benson '_s for beds and i was going to buy my new mattress from them till i compared the prices of both mattressman and benson for beds .
0	mattressman was cheaper and they offered free delivery !
0	as with all new companies i use , i always do a bit of reasearch into the company , after all i was parting with quite a bit of money and i wanted to be sure i was dealing_with a professional company .
0	ordering was easy , using the filtering system i was quickly able to find my new mattress .
0	i was taken through the usual steps of entering my personal details address and payment info and by the time i knew it i had ordered my new mattress .
0	delivery was painless too .
0	i received a phonecall from the driver that he had arrived , delivered by one man to my doorstep .
0	my experience of using mattressman was a pleasant one and i will_certainly be recommending mattressman to friends and family .
0	well_done matressman , keep_up the good work !
0	despite some of the reviews here , i am one of the customers who received excellent service .
0	i purchased a cannon professional cooker from them which not only was cheaper on their website but they would also personally deliver it themselves rather_than using a courier company or similar all the way to central_london !
0	!
0	my cooker arrived early on the day expected and i can '_t say that i am dissapointed .
0	in the future i think i will order from them
0	i have used lastminute for a number of things ranging_from flights and accomodation abroad to booking a hotel_room in the uk .
0	on all occassions i must_admit i have never had a problem with them .
0	the prices are clear and concise , it is clear what you are paying for .
0	e_- tickets are delivered promptly to my inbox .
0	there was only one issue once and that was to do with paying using my debit_card , although i think it was just a one off bug in the system which was soon resolved .
0	all in all i think a very good website that can be used to compare with similar services other_providers may offer .
0	i ordered a shoulder_bag from here .
0	they had a wide_range of choice and designs i couldn_'_t find with any other retailer .
0	i ordered my item and it arrived in a couple of days .
0	i was happy with my purchase and would definately shop again .
0	i first stumbled_across this website from another of their affilliates .
0	i was looking for designer_clothes that were offerred at competitive_prices .
0	my first order totalled nearly_£_000_pounds , but i must_admit , when i do shopping online i always research the website and read their reviews where possible .
0	this website had some negative_feedback , but to counter that had plenty of good feedback .
0	i placed my order , using my credit_card in case i needed to make a claim on it .
0	to my surprise , my order arrived the very next_day .
0	since then i have been using woodhouse clothing for all my clothing needs and i couldn_'_t be_happier with their service .
0	will be shopping there again soon .
0	i had never_heard of photobox until a friend of mine mentioned them .
0	i thought i would visit the website to find out more .
0	i found the website easy to navigate , however the wizard that is used to create you book was very fiddly and confusing even for me , a tech_savvy chap .
0	i soon got the hang of it though , and before i knew it i had created my book , ready to be printed and delivered .
0	on top of this i received 00 free prints ( 0 " x0 "... i think ).
0	for a start i thought this was great !
0	my prints arrived first , within two_days of ordering on a sunday_evening .
0	my book arrived 0 - 0 days_later as anticipated and i could not be_happier .
0	i am going to use their canvas product next !
0	i have been with o0 for years and have never_experienced any_problems with the provider .
0	i would rate their customer_services as good .
0	on one occassion i had a problem with a smartphone i had purchased from somewhere_else , o0 were still happy to help and did their best to resolve the issue .
0	although i never swear allegiance to them ( i always look for the best deal even if it means switching providers , i '_m with orange at the moment !
0	), they are better_than some of the providers out there .
0	i made an offer on a pc and was extremely happy when my offer was accepted .
0	i was even more delighted when delivery was free .
0	when the item arrived , before even opening it , i was confident it had arrived damage free .
0	the packaging was very well_done .
0	would definately shop again , and would get my recommendation .
0	when it '_s time to stock up , i know by now what type of supplement i '_m looking for ( fat burn , protein , creatine , etc_.)
0	and supplementwarehouse . com makes it easy to search for what i '_m after .
0	then , once i '_ve found it , they get me the best price - period .
0	to top it all off , they have great <$ 0 deals for me to sample products i might be interested in .
0	you really can '_t beat this site .
0	thanks for everything .
0	bradley
0	ordered a new xbox one console .
0	i was contacted regularly and kept up to date ..
0	i will use again ..
0	fantastic company
0	game was missing received only emty box , bord was not the one i looked online i pay for . board did not work and was badly_scratched . when i call shop from where was dispatched i heard them laughing when heard who i am , so i can only conclude it was done on purpuse . i was promised they will send city_link to collect . i waited from tuesday till friday_night , no collection .
0	after sending them email and promising them opening of paypal case and returning goods by royal maill and copy of their return_policy - they organised collection on monday .
0	unprofesional will newer use again .
0	rather pay more and get what you pay paid for .
0	not much to say besides of great !
0	good to shop from digital_rev !
0	buy a costume from here !
0	ordered lush wetsuit .
0	came two_days_later . brilliant !
0	i ordered a jacked in the afternoon and it was delivered by midday the following_day .
0	fantastic service and one of the most competitive_prices on the web .
0	highly_recommended !
0	website good and easy to use , created an account , and ordered some stuff at 00 . 00 monday_afternoon .
0	the delivery came just after 00 . 00 on tuesday .
0	that was good service , on standard delivery too .
0	the content was securely_packaged and everything was fine .
0	i would use them again .
0	painfully annoying to buy on here , will never use again , avoid at all costs .
0	and you can '_t verify yourself to make a review using your email .
0	first and last time i '_ll use them .
0	waited in all day to collect my parcel , didn_'_t turn_up .
0	you also have to wait_until 0pm at night before you can question whether anyone is actually going to come for the collection - by then it '_s too late to make alternative_arrangements .
0	the only thing you want from a delivery company is reliability and they failed .
0	when you speak to chat representative they just offer to reschedule your collection .
0	quick , easy , and very reasonably_priced great hardware !
0	!
0	whenever someone is asking what i use or where i get it , i always refer them to the supplement_warehouse .
0	this is my first time order online because i '_m fortunately to live close to both locations but i '_m_sure this service will be great too !
0	i have complete respect for a company like this which essentially gives money to customers for items they may be buying anyway .
0	i '_ve gotten a lot of cashback over the years which has allowed_me to buy something nice at the end of it all .
0	i used to use quidco . com a lot but i '_ve since moved over completely to topcashback . co . uk because they do not charge an annual_fee .
0	i still use quidco for the occasional deals that are not available on tcb such as instore cashback .
0	it would be great to see quidco remove their annual_fee .
0	keep_up the excellent work .

0	i used to use quidco . com but i '_ve now moved over completely to tcb because they do not charge an annual_fee and most of the time the cashback they offer is more .
0	keep_up the excellent work .
0	i '_ve been using this website for over 0 years_now and i think it '_s the most amazing site on the internet .
0	their weekly newsletter has a wealth of information and really does help to save_money .
0	if i need to sign up to a new contract for gas , electricity , broadband , mobile_phone or whatever , i always check mse to see the latest advice .
0	they have so much information their site and even if it is not covered , there is so much help available on the forums .
0	i must have saved thousands of £ in the last few_years just by the information available on this site .
0	keep_up the great work .
0	i '_ve ordered many things from play . com and i '_ve always been completely happy with their service .
0	i love the fact that all their delivery costs are included in the price as i feel the price displayed is without_any hidden_charges .
0	i '_ve had to return a few items and received a full_refund for them without_any hassle .
0	great company .
0	i used to be a customer for freedom0surf and never really ran into issues that required me to use their customer_services .
0	however , after i was no_longer a customer , i was still receiving marketing emails and emails reminding_me about payment for services i had terminated a long time ago .
0	i contacted customer_services who were really unfriendly about the whole situation .
0	they were rude and did not respect my choice to be removed from all their marketing / newsletter information .
0	there is no need for rudeness of this nature and i will not be using this company again .
0	in fact , i have since persuaded 0 friends from not using freedom0surf when they were considering using them for this very reason .
0	i '_m_sure that those friends will also pass on my experience and thus freedom0surf has lost a lot of potential business from me and my sharing of experience .
0	hdnl is the worst delivery company i have ever come_across .
0	unfortunately some companies i order from do not specify which courier they use and i often have the unfortunate luck to have hdnl for some of my orders .
0	about 00_% of the time , i am left infuriated with how the parcels are left at my house .
0	i '_ve parcels containing electric items thrown over my 0 foot garden_fence , parcels wedged into my gas_meter box , parcels left in my recycling_bin which was 0 / 0 full with garden cuttings and rotting vegetables , one time my wife had forgotten to lock her car and the parcel had been left in the drivers footwell ( this is something i '_m completely baffled about , do delivery drivers go around checking whether car doors are open for the houses they are attempting delivery at ??
0	), i '_ve had parcels left with complete strangers ( it '_s amazing that delivery drivers think that just because they live a few houses away , that they can '_t be strangers ), i '_ve even had a parcel left_behind my car and without having a note left ( car had been unused for a number of days and only after moving it did i find the parcel there .
0	the parcel were chocolates which could have been ruined as they were out in the rain ).
0	i really hate hdnl and make it a point to complain to the company i order from ( e . g .
0	amazon , john_lewis etc ), whenever they use hdnl .
0	hdnl '_s customer service is ridiculous as they have no quality control and the delivery drivers do not seem accountable to anyone .
0	very impressed with price and quality of products .
0	very fast delivey will recommend and use again .
0	0_star service !
0	work in the trade and started_using opt about 0 months_ago - wish i ' d found them 0 years_ago !!
0	!
0	brilliant products and info , prices are best i could_find and when i did have a query , phoned and spoke to rich - top bloke , sorted me out and went the extra_mile !
0	0 / 0 from me lads !
0	i ordered a fridge_freezer that was delivered in time , but it was damaged and getting them to pick it up has_been a nightmare , over two_weeks_later they managed to collect and after a further 0 days i got a refund , i reordered from appliancesdirect and withing 0days a perfect appliances arrived from two friendly drivers ,
0	order on monday_afternoon , and its delivered tuesday_lunch , what more could you ask for ?
0	it was all really simple , no_hassles at all , and fast communication .
0	very easy to find all the information which you could need to know , definitely recommend .
0	very easy to use and straight_forward to use with the latest deal going on .
0	i ordered flowers for valentines_day , which arrived looking nothing like the flowers that i had ordered .
0	it was missing all but one type of flower that it should have and in the other flowers place was just green_leaves .
0	i can safely say that i have never had a bad reading of inbaal in all the years she has_been doing readings for me , she has predicted things that i though " yeah_right that will never happen and then it did "
0	her way of giving readings is very honest in what she see '_s but at the same time in a friendly way , she has never gave_me any dud info and even when she has had to give any bad_news which i have to admit there has_been once or twice she has done it in a respectful and caring way that i can say that most other psychics i have been to do not ,.
0	i will be booking inbaal again soon as i '_m_sure its been awhile , and will highly_recommend her to anyone :-)
0	i was hesitant to order a camera for my girlfriend from digitalrev so close to christmas .
0	i was worried that , due to the company '_s base being in hong_kong , shipping would be expensive and take weeks .
0	my sister had recommended them so i bit the bullet .
0	i was pleasantly_surprised when my order was dispatched on friday the 00th and i received the camera , well_packaged and exactly as_described , on monday the 00th .
0	it is my experience that service like that is hard to find in the uk .
0	the camera is a genuine canon_g00 with a 0 year_warranty and is just not available for cheaper anywhere on the internet .
0	i will use digitalrev again without_hesitation .
0	i '_ve ordered from see tickets a few_times and although the tickets push it a little in arriving , i haven_'_t been let_down yet .
0	the kindle wasn_'_t for me ( yet ) but returning it couldn_'_t have been easier .
0	i '_ll be checking out the amazon tablet .
0	ordered my taps on 0th_august , received them on the 0th .
0	great service and perfect products .
0	recent booking with ebooker was smooth .
0	eticket came in like 00_minutes , that too at the middle of the night .
0	i would give 00 / 00 to the site .
0	all perfect
0	a little late and i have the iphone_0s unlocked
0	thanks ....
0	fik en ny rutter efter første opkald .
0	billigt og_god service , bedre kan det_ikke blive .
0	fast and easy trans .... will recommend ....
0	this was my first time ordering with digitalrev and i '_m very impressed !
0	fast delivery and everything turned_up on time with no_problems .
0	cannot find a cheaper place out there .
0	always my go to place to shop !
0	this site is probably the worst site i have dealt_with .
0	their communication is absolutely atrocious .. the only contact i have with them since thursday is a automated email response and the contact_numbers they have are completely_useless no one ever picks_up ..
0	i purchased my ticket on thursday and within 0 hours i was notified that my cc may have been misused by an_automated email .. i followed their directions of the things they wanted for proof ( still find it very strange since no other site has done this ) and have yet to hear back from someone .. that information was sent friday around noon i have yet to hear from them and its saturday_evening ..
0	my only solution now is to book my return flight with someone_else
0	would also like to add that i found out from my visa that you cancelled the transaction .. the same day i made the purchase .. thanks for the notice you guys are completely_useless
0	i '_ll also make_sure to pass on to everyone i know to never use your services
0	this website and the people that own it are amazing because my order came to me within 0 minutes of ordering .
0	thank_you guys
0	easy to set_up , easy to configure and even when you ' re not quite sure what to do you can simply ask them
0	recently booked an flight through travelsupermarket --> crystal_travel .
0	paid the amount , instantly received an email about booking with their booking number and itinerary but they didnt send me an e_- ticket .
0	after appr .
0	00_hours , i receive a call from them saying that my payment hasn_'_t gone_through but they still need confirmation of cancellation from me in writing ( email ).
0	how did i receive a confirmation_email from crytsal travel if my payment didnt go through ?
0	if my payment didnt go through , why do they need my confirmation for cancellation ?
0	not booking with them ever ..
0	i just want to complain_about the service i have been receiving with regards to their repair and protect washing_machine package i bought 0 months_ago .
0	their engineers come with one part and then leaves my house in 00 - 00_minutes apologizing they couldn_'_t fix and then i have to wait 0_weeks for next to come .
0	all i think is happening is ' hit and trail '.
0	they come with new part , try it , that don_'_t work and go back .
0	00th_sept , 00 was icing_on cake as your engineer didn_'_t turn_up .
0	i was sitting at home whole day waiting for engineer but no communication , nothing and when i checked my status of repair , it was saying repair complete .
0	no doubt , knowhow '_s facebook_page doesn_'_t allow user to add their comments as people don_'_t have much nice to say about the service they get i suppose .
0	worst company i have come_across .
0	stay_away
0	the lady was very helpful at the store and gave_me good advice with the installation of the bathroom .
0	very happy and positive woman which made the purchase very easy to make .
0	i have already_recommended to other family_members and friends who are thinking of a new bathroom_suite !
0	contacts arrived 0 days after they were ordered .
0	saved us travelling into_town and having to wait around in busy opticians .
0	very satisfied with the service and would recommend to friends and family .
0	aspect were very quick in responding to my call out , the engineer left the house as he found it and i found him very polite throughout the process !
0	very reasonable price and highly_recommended !
0	jeg_fik mine varer hurtigt_og nemt , ingen_problemer overhovedet .
0	det_gik smadder nemt , og prisen passede som markedsført .
0	meget_tilfreds .
0	food is good and reasnoble if you use a voucher but it never seems hot enough .
0	cookie was undercooked and coke tasted like carbonated water coloured brown .
0	sometimes things are in stock and you get good service ( guildford_branch ) othertimes things are out of stock ( including their warehouse ) and the service is lousy or the product is damaged and has to be returned .
0	i tend to go to toolstation instead of screwfix .
0	the prices are cheaper and service is better .
0	come on screwfix get your act_together and you could be a good company again !
0	have used them when flying to jersey from southampton for the past 0 years .
0	never had a delay or a problem .
0	cabin_crew were helpful but i think the plane could have been cleaner .
0	otherwise had a great service .
0	brought an item of ebay , was meant to be 00 hour courier .
0	package was despatched next_day but delivery is now 0 days late !
0	they tried delivering it twice , note was left on door and neighbour was happy to accept parcel .
0	second time i was in the house the whole day , i was down stairs next to my drive window and no vans arrived yet tracker said consignee could not be reached !
0	phoned customer_services who simply said they will deliver tommorow !
0	doubt i will ever get my parcel and reckon the yodel employee who was meant to deliver it went and saw his mates instead of delivering anything .
0	if its delivered by yodel i am not buying it .
0	join this campaign on [_link_]
0	[_name_] and [_name_] gave great advice , worked to our budget and helped_us choose a diamond we were happy with .
0	look_forward to receiving the completed rings in a week or so .
0	subject to rings arriving with no_problems as we expect , i can '_t fault the service received .
0	i ordered my camera on monday_morning - it arrived tuesday_afternoon ( hong_kong to central_london ).
0	now that '_s what i call service !
0	chillblast delivered my purchase on time and it worked immediately .
0	everything was packaged securely , competitivley_priced , and i was eligible for a free monitor upgrade as well .
0	they responded to my queries quickly and carefully , and were always helpful in answering my questions .
0	i would definitely recommend them to others .
0	a * for sure !
0	i really like the fast shipping and great customer service the company provides .
0	i '_ve_used these now 0 many games after my friend started_using them .
0	was a little_weary at first time as i ' d .
0	never_heard of them but trust me i '_ve_used them for orders via post which always come sooner_than they say it will be hear ( 0 - 0 days most ) and used cd_key email several time too now it '_s always in my inbox within 00_mins .
0	what makes it even better there always excellent prices , cheap as chips .
0	i used to use amazon all the time but since i '_ve found simply_games there '_s been no need as 0 - 00 times there always cheaper n new_releases .
0	use with confidence .
0	liam
0	" i received a phone_call as the printer i had originally ordered was out of stock – i found them very helpful , i was able to change my order there and then with minimal_fuss .
0	i am very pleased with both my purchase and the customer service i received ."
0	can '_t wait_until my contract_ends and i can switch .
0	been complaining direct and via_twitter , just get the same rubbish reply to run silly tests .
0	when in the office or at home i get 0 - 0 bars signal , but i get no calls or texts and most of the time i can '_t dial out .
0	then suddenly i get several texts all at once with varying timestamps up to hours before the current time .
0	tried my sim in other phones .
0	same thing happens .
0	rubbish .
0	i have used this company to order hundreds of dvd '_s over the past year .
0	they are super_fast at dispatching items , delivery normally takes 0 - 0 days , which isn_'_t bad considering how cheap it is .
0	i '_ve had a few problems with broken cases but they have refunded me within 00_hours of emailing them .
0	i recommend this company as they ' re always efficient :)
0	i '_ve ordered several things from this company , the delivery is always excellent .
0	i even receive pre orders before the day of release .
0	the prices are great , their extremely quick !
0	recommend to several friends .
0	fantastic !!!!!!!!!!!!
0	!
0	great price , slight_hiccup with delivery , but resolved very quickly and professionally , i would defiantly reccomend , and will be purchasing from lambda - tek again !
0	i bought a dpa headset mic from sound_exposure as the one we currently had , had just died , it arrived very promptly .
0	we then realised the mic seemed a lot_quieter_than the previous one .
0	soundexposure were very helpful and organised a quick replacement to this one .
0	all worked_perfectly .
0	would definately_use again .
0	as an architectural company gradually re - branding , we love the attitude of the promofix team and their approach to clients needs .
0	they are positive & friendly ( yet proffesional ) and are quick to respond to our requests .
0	what more could you want as a client , would highly_recommend .
0	i would recommend digital_rev to anyone .
0	i have been registered with their social_network for quite some time , and the speed and packaging through the store is superb !!
0	!
0	i ordered 0 products , the next_day they had been dispatched .
0	all but one , i sent them an email asking about it , 00_mins later i had one back saying they didnt have them in stock and i had been refuned .
0	if i had check my order on there website i would '_ve already of know the above .
0	so i choose a new mask which then arrived the same day as the rest of my stuff .
0	i would highly_recommend .
0	it was time for a new pc , i had a couple of friends who bought from pc_specialist , i check out reviews for pc_specialist and other pc builder options and am_glad i bought from pc_specialist , it came in 0_weeks , and was delivered the next_day after dispatch .
0	i worked out the price of buying all the part and building it myself and worked out cheaper to buy from pcs .
0	i have purchased from mpb before and found them to have some of the best used prices on the web for camera_equipment .
0	i decided to upgrade to a decent standard zoom by selling three of my old lenses via their ' trade in ' option .
0	i was a bit_dubious at first but the whole_process took a few_days from dpd picking_up my lenses ( for free ) to getting my new lens in the post .
0	i was offered good trade prices for my lenses ( more than i expected ), better_than certain high_street outlets , but you need to be honest about the condition of your stuff .
0	i was able to add more stuff to my order before it was dispatched and i received lots of communication via_email during the whole_process ; they also answered a few queries that i had quickly .
0	i am very happy with the lens i received which was advertised as exc ++ and it looks mint to me .
0	the only changes i would suggest to them is to link the trade process to your mpb account .
0	i already had an account ( from prior purchases ) but nothing about the trade and consequential sale was mentioned in it .
0	it would be nice to track the progress from your mpb account page .
0	also , once they received my items i had to ring them on the phone to pay the remaining balance , it wasn_'_t a problem and the process was quick and painless but it would have seemed a bit more streamlined if they just sent me a link to an online payment page or if it was linked to my mpb account and was auto added to my basket ( with the credit from the trade in showing ) with just the balance on the new lens to pay online .
0	overall i was very happy with my experience and i will_definitely be using them in future_purchases and / or equipment trade_ins .
0	i recently made a purchase from gear0music .
0	the item was delivered with in 0 days and for a reasonable price .
0	during the order process everything is clear and easy to understand and prices are explained well .
0	item was well_packaged upon_arrival .
0	all in all i was impressed and have added them to the list of my preferred music provider .
0	really fast delivery , products fit description .
0	customer service gave fast response when i had enquires about delivery timings .
0	great low_prices and tons of products .
0	shipping was a little high but hey so is fuel !
0	my new one stop_shop .
0	we dispatch our goods world wide and have collections from every courier company available in the uk , all the other drivers park outside and walk up to the first floor to collect our goods without_any_problems .
0	hermes do not , they park down the road , or behind the office and wont walk up the stairs to collect from us ...
0	upon ringing the main office the response was " our drivers are not allowed to leave their vans ".
0	as a delivery company surely this policy does not make any sense , how do the drivers delivery to the customer ?
0	come on hermes , step it up please .
0	i brought a pair of ray_bans at 00 : 00 and they arrived by 00 : 00 the next_day , fast brilliant service , very helpful , will be shopping here again .
0	ordered on friday_night came tuesday via nxt_day deliv and a great product
0	i ordered a laptop from pcspecialist around the end of october .
0	i was looking to purchase a laptop as a desktop replacement for work with audio and this required certain specifications .
0	even_though the company is focused on providing gaming pcs i found that the options to choose from when building my system were very broad .
0	the pricing of components is excellent and i found that i could build a high - end machine for literally half the price of some of the obvious top end brands such as dell , apple and sony .
0	my product is solidly_built , ergonomic , and looks pleasing to the eye .
0	one of the concerns that comes with ordering a product like this online is ...
0	ordering a product like this online ; spending alot of money and worrying that something could go_wrong or not be built to standard .
0	this is just not the case , i was constantly_updated on where my order was in the production line , given time estimates and clear details on my order and invoice .
0	my product arrived just 0 working_days_later in perfect_condition and to my exact_requirements .
0	in addition the customer service is second to none .
0	i had a little problem with a bluetooth driver and this was solved within minutes via friendly knowledgable_staff .
0	all in all a great experience with them and i '_ll be purchasing from them again soon .
0	i purchased a masuri titanium cricket_helmet for my friend ’_s birthday , he loved the helmet , but the masuri titanium cricket_helmet was dirty .
0	event thought the masuri titanium cricket_helmet was in new unopened packing , the helmet was stained , there was dirt marks on the helmet , it looked like it could have been a display_model instead of being new , i paid £_00 for the masuri titanium cricket_helmet and i wasn_'_t impressed by the condition .
0	i also purchased a gray nicholls fiber glass sheet which i love that was really good value .
0	the shipping was free and really fast .
0	overall i was really happy with the fast shipping on my goods , but unhappy with the masuri titanium cricket_helmet which was a present for my friend has dirt marks on .
0	i would recommend this company to my friends ,
0	we stayed at villa nino in lanzarote and had a wonderfull time took our 0th month old baby and having the villa was great best holiday we have been on and i will_defo be booking with jamesvillas again !!

0	ordered bioshock_infinite on the xbox_000 .
0	at the time it was the best price available in the uk .
0	the delivery was also very prompt .
0	very happy .
0	i would def recommend this service to all my friends !
0	!
0	i would recommend anyone to use mazuma_mobile ltd .
0	the website is user - friendly and simple to use .
0	we went to vital_concept for a new website .
0	ravi was brilliant in his approach , we sat down together and before hand he had already done his industry research and was able to show me market_leaders and how they went about with their website designs !
0	already very impressed with vitals pro - active approach i was more so impressed when they were able to come up with designs and functionalities within just a few_days !
0	with the website complete , they provided an in - depth yet very easy to understand manual on how to use and upload to our new site .
0	overall , i would 000_% recommend any business to use vital_concept , not only for the quality websites they make but for the efficiency , knowledge and great client aftercare they provide across all of their services .
0	we at kenford builders will most certainly keep on coming_back !!

0	when organising the stag_do for 00 people i thought of the pain of having to ring up activity places , hotels , getting peoples money and deposits ....... but when i discovered chillisauce could do all that for me it was a no_brainer .
0	simon the rep from chillisauce put_together the ideal package to suit our needs and i could sit_back and wait for the action packed weekend to arrive .
0	all the activities were top_class and the hotel location was ideal for walking_distance to the main nightlife in liverpool city_centre .
0	i would certainly recommend using chillisauce , and if i was organising a large event again i will be using them for sure !
0	many_thanks chillisauce for making this stag_weekend a huge_success .
0	fantastic bespoke product delivered to exact_specification & requirements i asked for .

0	excelent service miles better_than envirophone !
0	great supplements company , have a great range of products , a great knowledge and passion and are totally customer_focussed .

0	catherine was extremely_helpful not just with what i wanted to know but she also offered more help once she had finished , a lovely_lady
0	ordered a phone on thursday that was of a fair condition .
0	saw that there was actually a very good condition phone of the same make and model so i emailed the contact address that same day to ask to swap if i paid the difference .
0	someone got back to me within minutes ( after 0pm no less !)
0	and had agreed to ' upgrade ' to the better quality phone .
0	the phone was dispatched on friday and arrived on the monday .
0	the communication was brilliant from these_guys and i would suggest asking if you have any questions , they seemed more than happy to help !
0	their " order and collect next_day in store " option is a lie .
0	you will be told on the website that your item will be available to collect next_day , you will be told repeatedly on the phone that this is correct .
0	it '_s not , it '_s a lie .
0	you will have to wait 0 - 0 working_days during which time you cannot cancel the order and no explaination will be given .
0	do not order online with them .
0	superb service , no_hassle at all .
0	ordered online , ugg_boots received in quick time , think i have found my new store to order from , more orders coming they ' re way shortly for my hols

0	wow
0	i will recommend to my friends and family .
0	thanks mr_memory :)
0	it '_s been a while since i '_ve been on ebuyer '_s website , so i was a little_worried that things might have changed .
0	but it '_s good to know that they still provide the amazing service and great prices that first attracted me to them years_ago .
0	so , i was told about a nautical themed_party at my company and decided what a great idea it would be to go in fancy_dress as a sailor .
0	so , off i go to escapade in camden to see what they have to offer .
0	the store is huge with loads of costumes to pick from .
0	i almost lost my mind walking around that shop .
0	the costume selection was amazing !
0	in the end , i found what i wanted and gave it a try in the changing rooms .
0	it was a snug_fit , but i wanted something bigger .
0	so i asked and they told me they have a warehouse with lots more sizes .
0	a dream come true !
0	so , at that moment , i jumped on my phone , found the outfit and bought a bigger_size for myself .
0	quick and easy .
0	the costume arrived at my home , i tried it on and it fit great .
0	i looked awesome in it and couldn_'_t wait to show it off at the party .
0	excellent customer service and a great price match_feature !
0	they have some of the best deals on the web , i have now gotten all of my friends to start using this website instead of bodybuilding . com .
0	they have a few products that i haven_'_t found elsewhere .
0	they also have some great shakercups .
0	buy all of your supplements from supplementwarehouse !
0	i booked two flights one for myself and one for my partner from beijing to kuala_lumpur however the site crashed and timed out .
0	like other_reviewers the booking process could have only taken 0 minutes and budget_air are more than happy to take your money !
0	budget_air then charged my credit_card for each flight ( 0x £_000 . 00 ) informing_me i would have a refund within 00_hours for both charges .
0	one charge was refunded and the other has not .
0	i have called the call_centre multiple_times .
0	.
0	.
0	no answer !
0	i have emailed their customer_services .
0	.
0	.
0	no answer !
0	the impression i get from this is budget_air conduct themselves in an unscrupulous and dishonest manner with no regard to customer_services .
0	i also believe this could be argued to be theft .
0	budget_air – please can you refund my £_000 . 00

0	this as you can_imagine put a dampener on the evening .
0	hooters was brilliant as expected !!!

0	it was sorted_out in 00_minutes .
0	highly_recommend to anyone not wanting to pay full retail prices !
0	some amazing bargains .
0	it was great shopping , but i am considering to high for shipping for the item i had purchase and also do not see united_states postal service for cheap and fast services .
0	was very good experience however , the sell order before phone apprantly did not get recived and i lost my dal
0	i sent my phone off to them on the 00 / 00 /_0000 and it is still not with them they should not make their return envelopes so obvious so they can be intercepted in the post by thieves in the royal_mail !
0	i feel this is a major_issue that needs to be dealt_with by the company .
0	now i have to wait_till july before i can have a decent phone again !
0	i will never use this company ever again !
0	i booked a theatre and meal deal through lastminute . com for my girlfriends_birthday .
0	i didn_'_t pay a lot for the deal so i wasn_'_t expecting much in terms of meal and seats but i was planning to make the most of it all the same .
0	we arrived for the meal at kitchen italia in covent_garden and were handed a small menu called their " rapido " menu .
0	the waitress explained that we entitled to a main course from the rapido menu and a glass of house wine or soft drink .
0	so good so_far , however , 00_minutes after ordering our meals and drinks , nothing had arrived .
0	then out of nowhere , a small slab of lasagne arrived in front of me , stone cold !!!
0	i told the waitress who didn_'_t even offer an_apology and took the food away .
0	meanwhile , my girlfriends macaroni and cheese arrived complete with raw pieces of bacon in it !!!
0	so again we told the waitress and again no apology and again took the food away .
0	0 minutes later my lasagne was returned , nuked to an inch of it '_s life and my girlfriends macaroni and cheese minus the raw bacon .
0	both tasted as bad as they looked and we still hadn_'_t had our drinks .
0	at this point we decided to leave , without so much as a goodbye from the staff .
0	before we left i did notice that the meal offered would '_ve cost us £ 0 . 00 each , along with the £_00 theatre_tickets , our so called " deal " should '_ve cost £_00 . 00 ...... i paid £_00 . 00 !!
0	!
0	anyway , the seats in the theatre were great and the show was awesome , apart_from the over enthusiastic woman next to me who hit me on the head and in the face several_times , to my girlfriends delight !
0	!
0	so to sum_up , lastminute theatre and meal deals aren_'_t deals at all and cost more than face value .
0	and stay_away from kitchen italia !!!
0	!
0	i am been trying to set_up drirect debt for for 0 years every time i try to set_up with them they say that you direct debt is not set_up and they charge you 0 pound for not having direct debt talktalk is so bad would book about how bad they are seriously
0	it is definitely the best and fastest way to find a good place where to stay .
0	in a few_seconds and without_any extra fees you can choose and book your place .
0	i never travel without using it !
0	organised service and friendly , but unhappy with the price after doing further research .
0	for headlight re alignment and bulb replacement cost £_00 quid including mot .
0	in reply to this they offered me a £_00 refund which i accepted
0	checking the internet with many other travel_insurance websites i found that essential_travel_insurance gave_me the best cover for price that i needed for my trip .
0	the item took too long to arrive considering delivery cost £ 0 . 00 , i didn_'_t receive the item for a few_days , the courier failed to collect the item twice .
0	i was looking for a atomiser that was not on safercigs site i had been looking everywere for this .
0	i had heard of safer_cigs from a mate , so i emailed daz asking for this atomiser that i had been looking for he emailed me back within the hour and he had what i was looking for as discontinued stock so i sent a way for them and they came the next_day iam really happy with the service and would say that safercigs is a good service to e_cigs if you are looking for anything for e_cigs then just ask they would go out there way to help 0_stars from me
0	this is the 0rd time i have used double 0 , to buy tickets and have never had any_problems , the first two times the tickets came via special delivery around one week before the concert , however this time i ordered tickets for michael_buble in december and they turned_up yesterday that '_s 0 months early : d , i will_continue to use double 0 tickets in the future and , they are now the first place i look if i want excellent seats and good prices .
0	have no_complains what so ever , my xbox was repaired quickly and for a good price and i haven_'_t had any trouble with it since .

0	had paint_balling arranged for the saturday as part of a stag_weekend away in newcastle , which was a painful blast !.
0	guestlist entry into tiger_tiger on the friday_night with a bar_crawl added in to .
0	which i found better on the sat night as it was full of girls girls girls !!
0	!.
0	my one beef i had with newcastle '_s club seen was club luna , i suggest if your not a chav !
0	you stay clear as sh_* t seems to happen in that club if your not a chav as our group found out .
0	but other than that top painful weekend for us all would defo come_back for seconds !!
0	!
0	this is the second time i '_ve_used mazuma and for the second time the transaction went off entirely without a hitch .
0	bag arrived promptly ( taking into account the recent postal disruption with the bad_weather ) and money was credited to my nominated account the same day the phone arrived back .
0	paid for one month license expecting a good outcome to help me thrive in fifa_coins , however the complete_opposite occurred , the told me programming errors had occurred upon several_occasions causing me to lose all of my fifa_coins with no compensation because i didn_'_t look at their facebook_page due to being in school .
0	you will never get a reliable service from this company
0	don_'_t use this service , id recommend look at other bots .
0	quick rapid responses and around the clock support
0	they were on time within the time they say .
0	great service with amazing customer service to get back to you in a timely_manner .
0	they do exactly_what they say .
0	i would recommend to friends .
0	im so glad i stumbled_across muchbetteradventures . com while trying to plan a ski / snowboard holiday for this year !
0	booking a holiday for a group of 00 can be quite a stressful experience , making_sure all the details are correct and everyone is happy , especially with all the information google chucks at you from hundreds of holiday sites .
0	as soon as i found much_better adventures i was blown_away with how easy and simple they made the whole_process .
0	after entering just a few details of what we were looking for , i had a speedy response ( from real people not just an_automated_response !)
0	who i could tell had an interest in our specific_requirements and made a real effort to gain us deals and quotes for suitable holidays .
0	i '_ve_used surfdome multiple_times before and i always go back to that website .
0	i can '_t find anything wrong with my purchase here .
0	i had all the info i needed and emails covering every_stage of the process .
0	i ' d definitely recommend them !
0	i write to thank_you for the recent advice you gave_me regarding backing up my clients artwork files in the cloud .
0	a task which i have been dreading for some time .
0	at sun jones , we pride_ourselves on offering quality products and excellent customer service .
0	it ’_s therefore incredibly important that the suppliers we choose share the same ethos .
0	not only did you take the time to fully explain the options_available to me , but you went out of your way to stop me purchasing office 000 from you and instead directed me to a solution that was best for my business , even if it meant you losing out on a sale .
0	it ’_s your commitment to customer_satisfaction and expert_knowledge of your industry that will see techmonkeys grow from strength to strength and i will do my utmost to refer clients , colleagues , friends and family to you for all their it requirements .
0	update_:
0	success !
0	i can confirm that the issues i have had with regus have now been resolved , thanks to their dedicated customer service team at surrey .
0	for the way that their customer service team handled the situation , i have altered the rating from being a one star to a three star_review .
0	unfortunately , due to the experience i have had , i won_'_t be retracting my original review as i think people should still be aware of the potential issues they can come_across when dealing_with regus .
0	original review :
0	- hidden_charges .
0	at no point did the salesman , edward discuss the additional services mentioned in the terms and conditions .
0	he discussed rent rates , telephone and internet rates so why not point out the other charges as well .
0	i get the impression that they play a game of " who can we catch out " with prospective_customers .
0	their abuse of trust is morally and ethically disgusting and i hope they are investigated for their deception .
0	you only have to type " regus " and " complaints " in google to see that i am not the only one affected by this .
0	- extremely poor reception , call answering and mail service .
0	on numerous_occasions , i had calls to my mobile from clients and prospective_clients saying that i hadn_'_t returned their call .
0	why ?
0	because i never got the message , that '_s why !
0	i even spoke with the receptionist , christine , about whether anyone had come into the building asking for my company to which she replied " yes , someone called richard was asking for you but i told_him you weren_'_t here so he left ".
0	this was a prospective customer who i have since never_heard from and presumably he has chosen to use a different company .
0	there was no attempt made to take his details so i couldn_'_t follow_up on his visit .
0	i will be looking into the " supply of services and goods_act_0000 " to establish whether regus are in breach of contract by not carrying out their duties adequately .
0	as a direct result of choosing regus , i have lost business .
0	- poor office conditions .
0	my office was centrally_located in the building so i had no windows to help cool down .
0	even in the winter_months , i had to leave my door open to ensure a steady supply of fresh_air .
0	and just 0 months before my contract was due to end , i found out that a business opposite mine ( in a similar_sized office ) had air_conditioning controls !
0	why do some have it and not others ?
0	- damaged reputation .
0	i referred a client ( and a good friend ) to regus for a short_term office ( this was before i was fully_aware of how regus operate ).
0	at no point did regus head_office or centre management acknowledge the referral .
0	he only had the office for 0 months but since leaving , he has had numerous issues with regus ( major accounting errors , false charges etc_.)
0	and is now on poor terms with me as a result of the recommendation .
0	this particular client has quite a high spend with me and i may lose a considerable_amount of business as a result of this .
0	do not recommend anyone to regus .
0	- security .
0	the lights in the office are automatic - they only turn on when someone is in the room and stay on for about 00 - 00_minutes after leaving .
0	a few_times on arriving at the office , i noticed that the lights were already on before entering ( and sometimes late at night when i decided to pop in to do a bit of work out of hours ) so i questioned the center manager , sharon , about this .
0	she told me that the cleaning staff had key access to all the offices to ensure they could carry out their duties even when the offices are locked .
0	this was very concerning to me as i use a lot of expensive equipment , software and also stored confidential documents in the office .
0	fortunately i never had to report a theft but my office was at the mercy of their security practices - a scary thought when they aren_'_t even able to take messages for me !
0	in conclusion , regus are a cowboy_outfit .
0	they rely_on their global brand to create the impression of trust and use deceptive and misleading sales_tactics to lure you into a false_sense of security .
0	purchased for a christmas_present for my dad and it was just what he wanted , ideal .
0	they were helpfully with the delivery query i had and would use them again
0	their prices are always more than fair , and if you can by stroke of luck happen to find an even cheaper price , they will even beat it .
0	i '_ve never had problems with any order and it always comes extremely fast .
0	if you aren_'_t ordering from sw , you aren_'_t getting the best bang for you buck , hands_down !
0	i '_m an 00 year_old student from birmingham and i ordered a gladiator mask for halloween to resemble one of my favourite rappers ; mf doom .
0	they sent me a cannibal mask - like the one hannibal lecter wore .
0	they sent the correct one out the next_day , after i rang them , and i have sent back the wrong mask .
0	they said they would refund the postage it cost me to return it , but as soon as i said i had sent it , i haven_'_t received an email or refund from them .
0	very organised and the online payments were easy to track .
0	alpharooms sux , i booked a hotel that was advertised with room facilities eg , air_conditioning , sea vew , cable tv and fridge .
0	yes those facilities were there but had to pay extra for each facilies when we arrived .
0	the transfer they arranged kept us waiting 0 hours at 0am in turkey at the airport .
0	the customer service is very poor and arrogant .
0	first and last holiday with alpharooms .
0	i ordered an item in the wrong_size and contacted customer_services about the mistake .
0	not only did the item arrive quickly and well_packaged but they also arranged to send the correct item just as quickly and kept me well informed .
0	i cannot recommend this company highly_enough , finally customer_services as they should be .
0	what a pointless delivery company .
0	cannot find my address even_though we live in a major city eg manchester !
0	just spoke to oliver at customer_services who confirmed they do not provide sat_navs as a company .
0	well maybe they should .
0	here '_s to a day taken off work for nothing .
0	thanks guys .
0	i replaced my regular 0 part brush with this one and was very pleased .
0	and it '_s pretty to boot .
0	it holds the monomer well and is easy to form a good pearl .
0	you will like it !

0	i caught the delivery man peeing in front_door of flars 0 ! weeks before and i was upset with him for that , he started , to abuse me instead for saying sorry , i wrote to the company about this issue got no reply and no action was taken
0	this saturday i met same delivery man , he said to me that he is gonna hit me once he finishes delivering , i simply called police and this delivery man disappeared quickly , i need to file proper complain in police_station as the company doesnt care , so be carefull
0	very trusted
0	did shoppping many_times .
0	trusted site
0	fastest delivery . happy with bike , price , and seller .

0	shopped first time was bit scared but will shop again now .
0	thanks
0	really great site .. amazing price .. quick delivery !
0	took less_than a week to sell my mobile and have the cash in the bank and its very simple to do ... :)
0	i have recently signed_up for wowcher , as i saw a good deal and thought why not ?
0	now i know why not , terrible customer service ....
0	attempted to buy deal , and was informed card was rejected and to re - check details , after doing so , card rejected again .
0	checked with my bank , money taken twice by wowcher .
0	once calling them , no help at all , just told my money has_been ring fenced and somebody will contact me back tomorrow , after not recieving a call , try them again .
0	" customer service deal with this issue , but we can '_t transfer you to them " " sit tight , someone will contact you " still no call , 0 days on .
0	so funds taken , no product , so_far no refund ( which when i do eventually get , will be 00days or something ).
0	if a high_street shop took your money and didnt give you what you wanted and said " well you can '_t speak to anyone ".
0	that would be stealing , it '_s a joke !
0	funniest thing is , the offer was a limit of 0 per customer , however i '_ve been charged_twice ....... and have nothing to show for it , accept a lower balance on my account .
0	terrible system , service and company !
0	won_'_t be using them ever again .
0	just as description , quick delivery ... no issues at all :)
0	i ordered valentines flowers on 00 / 00 / 00 for my girlfriend that is currently in oz .
0	by 0pm oz time there was no sign of the flowers ...
0	i called eflorist , to be told that they have to contact their oz office to find out what the order status is and then get back to me after 00hrs ... t
0	he occassion had been completely_ruined by now as a ) the ( over priced ) flowers were not delivered , and b ) i had to ask if the " suprise " gift had arrived or a " no one in " delivery card left_behind ... etc .
0	following my complaint , the flowers were delivered at midnight on 00 / 00 / 00 , waking_up the household .
0	the flowers delivered did not resemble those in the online picture and half of the stock was dead or dying .
0	later i received a smug email from eflorist informing that the flowers had been delivered on 00 / 00 /_0000 .
0	i have complained again and now wait to see what eflorist have to say about this ...
0	i understand from other posts that they will offer a 00_%_discount ( against what is essentially an over priced product ) but try not to pay , or , if you push for it , a full_refund !
0	... that they also try not to pay .
0	in short , don_'_t put your faith in eflorist for special / meaningful occasions ... there is a real chance that they will let you down in more ways than one .
0	i will not use them again and strongly_recommend others to go_elsewhere .
0	traded my near perfect_condition samsung mobile_phone online saying they will " honor the agreed price " then they decided to slash £_00 from the agreed price saying the phone has a big scratch on the screen .
0	if i asked for my phone back they will probably send me a damaged one or purposely damaged the phone themselves .
0	they didn_'_t even reply to my e_- mail when i considered legal_action ( advised by my solicitor friend ).
0	so please avoid using this company in store or online .
0	as the title_says , payment was instant !
0	so was the freepost return bag !
0	got my iphone_0s unlocked on the emea service network , great communication from this guy_who kept me in the loop all along the entire_process .

0	found the website after looking for a new rug and being a little put off by high_street prices .
0	this site is great !
0	i was a little_wary at first as i always am with lesser_known companies , but i took the dive and ordered from them .
0	couldn_'_t be_happier , good price and quick delivery .
0	i hadn_'_t ordered from supplementwarehouse since_0000 and decided to give them a shot again .
0	i purchased some bcaa '_s , glutamine , and a pre_- workout .
0	i placed my order just before midnight on 00 - 0 and it arrived at my doorstep by 0 am today 00 - 0 .
0	while the shipping_costs were higher_than most places i believe the costs of the products themselves made it worth it and i couldn_'_t believe_how fast it arrived at my house .
0	everything in my shipment was exactly_what i had ordered including my free_samples .
0	i will_definitely be using them again in the future if i continue to have positive_experiences like this one .
0	items arrived damaged in transit .
0	wiggle were brilliant in responding issuing replacements straight_away .
0	service with a smile .
0	thank_you wiggle !
0	service excellent , product excellent , price , unbeatable .
0	very helpfully on the phone , very fast reliable delivery , will be back for more items very soon
0	i have made a few orders with peak_nutrition and they have had the delivery at my door the next_day .
0	i like the next_day delivery , it is very effiicient .
0	whenever i have spoken to the people at peak_nutrition i have been spoken to warmly and they have dealt_with me well .
0	i buy cellfood and this is teh only place i can buy it in the uk from what i am aware .
0	i recommend them .
0	when shopping with supplement_warehouse it '_s never cut season for your wallet , even when it '_s showtime .
0	the price competitor option guarantees you the cheapest prices .
0	even if you dig through the net and actually find something cheaper , supplement_warehouse will dominate the price guaranteed .
0	there is no point in spending your hard_earned dollar on the same products elsewhere for twice the price .
0	i hope you read this and start making those serious gains with supplement_warehouse .
0	pretendo comprar novamente neste site / loja / empresa !
0	i '_ve had a good experience with them over 0 months .
0	the service was a bit more personal than british_gas who i ' d used previously and they faired well in my area on the price comparison_sites .
0	i paid for this and it was just a bunch of links to other_websites .
0	the only detailed_information on the site was how to download illegally hacked software .
0	the information on how to jailbreak the iphone is freely_available on the internet from legitimate companies such as iphone dev team .
0	customer service was poor and there is misleading information on the website .
0	i paid £_00 for an immediate unlock which ended_up taking about 0_weeks and only lasted until the next apple update when the exploit used was patched .
0	the site is well_designed , and makes it incredibly easy to find the right hostel for your requirements and budget .
0	really happy with the service received from car_mats uk .
0	the mats arrived exactly as ordered within a few_days of order being placed .
0	quality is very good and they are an absolutely perfect fit .
0	i went for the red and black edging and am very happy i did as it matches really well with the golf_gti red trim .
0	would recommend without_hesitation and will_certainly use again in the future .
0	the service provided by just pose massively exceeded our expectations .
0	we submitted our booking enquiry very close to the wedding date as we only decided we wanted a photo booth at the last_minute .
0	despite this , sam managed to respond very quickly , confirm our booking and get things moving in terms of confirming design choices and logisitics .
0	we were very happy with the design of the booth we picked ( vintage i believe ) and it matched the theme of our_wedding really well .
0	on the day the booth was manned by dan ( i believe - young , dark haired chap ).
0	he was absolutely fantastic and did a great job for the entire duration from set_up to the end of the evening .
0	he was cheerful , polite and very professional at all times .
0	he was also very approachable and was clear in explaining how the booth worked .
0	we were also very happy with the online gallery .
0	it is good that you upload the photos as they were in the sets , but also the individual pictures .
0	almost every guest we have spoken to have said that the booth really helped make the evening special .
0	we wouldn_'_t hesitate to recommend just pose to anyone looking for a photobooth and i would be incredibly surprised if anyone could offer a photo booth service better_than just pose did for our_wedding .
0	decent prices but sometimes hard to find specific flavors
0	its not often you get all three of the above when shopping online .
0	from browsing the website to receiving the goods the service is second to none !
0	the website is very informative , with logo '_s of the computer manufacturer , crystal_clear images of the memory , and best of all even a picture of the computer that you wish to upgrade , it really gives you reassurance that you are looking at the correct products that you need .
0	i made a mistake on my address when i placed the order so phoned them up , and someone answered the phone straight_away .
0	why cant all websites and companies be like mrmemory ?
0	!
0	i bought guild_wars 0 from onlinekeystore at the night and get the code 0min after i have payed for the product !

0	would happily buy from again , shipping was fast and reasonable prices .
0	they not always be the cheapest on products , but their customer_support is always good .
0	i '_ve had several issues with products i '_ve purchased from them in the past but have always been dealt_with promptly and to a more than satisfactory level .
0	recently had a holiday to tenerife booked through thomas_cook , it was a very good holiday , the reason i give it 0_stars though is because thomas_cook were pretty unenthusiatic , was informed that we ' d receive a discount card for restaurants , attraction etc .
0	plus money off our next holiday , never received .
0	and all transport , when part of thomas_cook , was always ridiculously late .
0	other than that , i had a great holiday , i would_gladly use thomas_cook again , but feel these are thing thay could work on .
0	been using zavvi since it '_s buy out by " thehut " and i have to say i '_ve never had any_issues with them yet and they quite often undercut competitors on price .
0	definitely worth keeping an eye on their " mega monday " deals .
0	ordered a 0gbp chainstay protector and received a 0gbp sports_nutrition shake .
0	this to me is a monumental cock_up as it '_s not as if you can get the two confused .....
0	hopefully this problem will be sorted promptly without hassle .
0	i ordered some whey_protein after paying a substatial amount more elsewhere , very happy with the product and service received .
0	fast delivery and price for the item cheapest which i could_find in whole internet .
0	i would like to highly_recommend boston ltd .
0	another seamless and hassle_free transaction .
0	i recently_bought a tag_heuer formula 0 watch from iconic_watches .
0	i was a little_suspicious of making this online purchase , especially with the great price that was being quoted .
0	however , the whole_experience was first_class .... and the great price was just another benefit of dealing_with iconic .
0	the communication from the team was great and the watch arrived when they said it would .
0	i have already_recommended this to friends and colleagues .
0	fantastic service with very good communication .
0	quick deliver and a good price
0	great website with loads of choice .

0	very easy to find flights for your destination .
0	easy to select what options you want and organize by price or number of stops .
0	transparent_pricing and no_hidden_charges !
0	i recently_bought a canon_000d ( body only ) from simply_electronics .
0	i placed the order on the evening of thursday 00th_sep and before i confirmed the order , i rang the customer_services number from their website to confirm stock_levels and to make_sure i would get one of the only 0 bodies in stock , i was assured i would !
0	i received excellent communication during the purchase , as in i got an email after purchase , after funds clearance ( next_day with paypal ), after id verification , and after dispatch with tracking_number with dhl .
0	i received my camera the following thursday 00nd_september , so all in all , one week turn_around from placing the order to delivery to dublin , ireland .
0	would i reccomend them - yes
0	would i use again - yes

0	having spent a bit of time researching i decided what i would ideally want from a new desktop_pc .
0	i tried dinopc along with 0 others and ran a price comparison based on my desired specifications .
0	i decided that dinopc offered both the best specification and price so placed an order .
0	my new pc was delivered 0_weeks_later ( as stated on the website ) and i '_m more than happy with what i '_ve got .
0	i would definitely recommend dinopc if you are in the market for a new desktop_pc .
0	i '_ve just purchased a samsung 00 " smart_tv from rgb direct and , as is always the case when ordering from a new company , was a little_bit_nervous ( especially as the price was so good !
0	).
0	i needn_'_t have worried though as the tv arrived the next_day as promised during the phone conversation prior to ordering , to check it was in stock .
0	overall very pleased with rgb direct & wouldn_'_t hesitate to recommend them or purchase from them again .
0	i '_ve been buying from sw for a long time .
0	their customer service is top_notch .
0	if i ever have a problem with the price matching service , they make it right .
0	they have to hate google shopper , but at_least they still honor their claims .
0	the best part is that they will still sell things that have been_discontinued unlike retail_stores or many other online dealers , which is why i keep_coming_back .
0	once you find something that works , it really sucks when it '_s taken off the market and you can '_t find it anymore .
0	not so with sw !
0	keep_up the good work guys .
0	i wish shipping prices could be reigned in a bit .
0	it always makes me question my purchase right at checkout time , but such is the price of doing_business i suppose .
0	ordered this game in february and got it the day before release_date .
0	great price set months in advance and great end product .
0	thankyou gameseek .
0	one word , faultless !
0	bought my v fest ticket with double 0 , ticket came within a couple of days , great service , was informed when it had been dispatched and delivered .
0	will_definitely recommend too freinds and use again !
0	!
0	i visit this site more than 0 times a week to check out the killer deals they are always running .
0	it is so easy to find anything i could ever want on here .
0	the selection and prices cannot be beat , and if if you can find something cheaper they don_'_t only match it , they beat it by 0 %!
0	i can '_t say enough to describe how much i love this site .
0	romek helped_us with an office move .
0	he was very efficient , punctual helpful and friendly .
0	i would definitely chose to work with him again .
0	excellent customer service - their team managed to get my wife '_s engagement_ring in advance of when i needed it and made sure i had everything i needed before whisking her away to propose .
0	can '_t praise them higher .
0	tried click finance for a car loan and was very happy with the service
0	after two_weeks from my order , i had not received any shipping confirmation and the order was still showing as " processing " in my account .
0	after writing to the customer_support , though , i got a super - quick response saying the first shipment probably had got lost .
0	a new shipment was issued the same day , and arrived two_days after .
0	best price on the net for pre order for bbc0 delivered on time will be using them again
0	you can '_t get better then jovago for booking hotels for your africa trip .
0	fast response in case you need any help from customer_services .
0	jovago all the way
0	insured quite a few_times my rentals with questor .
0	once someone drove in to my car while abroad at night , to find car damaged on parking lot ...
0	did not took them long to return me my excess i pad for damage .
0	am using them all the time with no_problems
0	clear account offer a really good alternative to payday lending and they are cheaper !
0	if it wasn_'_t for the constant bank connection errors this would be a 0_star .
0	and the frustrating thing is often the error can happen just when you need it most , meaning you are stranded .
0	in my particular case i had an_emergency and really needed funds badly .
0	i spoke to one of their representatives who told me not to log on to internet_banking for 00_minutes whilst he " did a reset ".
0	i waited but the problem continued and was left without access to funds in my clear account all night .
0	i tried to call back after the 00_mins but got no answer .
0	there is no out of hours support_team which means after 00 : 00 you just can '_t get any help .
0	some times the bank connection issue can last a couple of days !
0	after my problem i email customer_services and the response was " stock " and not and explanation at all .
0	in summary i think it '_s a good service but personally i have had a " hiccup " with an unsatisfactory response .
0	i have just made my first purchase and it went very smoothly and couldn_'_t have been easier .
0	i '_ll be back !
0	i was so surprised to see so many negative_comments .
0	i have been a customer for more than 0 years ( changed a place 0 time ) and never had any_problems with them , it is simply working all the time .
0	called call - center once re .
0	contract extension - and everything_went_smoothly .
0	also so cheap !
0	i am using momondo for more than 0 years_now .

0	never had any_problems
0	0 days_later and my order hasn_'_t been picked or shipped .
0	i tried to contact customer service to cancel my order and guess_what ?
0	they ' re closed on saturdays .
0	awful experience and total_lack of customer service .
0	if somethings not in stock or there is a problem you should send a email or get in contact with the customer .
0	i '_ve never waited this long to have a order picked or shipped , and i usually receive my products within 0 - 0 days from every other company i use .
0	i will not use supplement_warehouse again !!!
0	!
0	when i discovered cjs_keys , i expected something to be wrong or perhaps questioned the legitimacy of the site and / or service .

0	i couldn_'_t believe_how easy it was to order from cjs and claim my key for such a fantastic price .
0	i will 000_% be using cjs again .
0	i contacted the company to see if they would pricematch with a price i had seen elsewhere and immediately they did .

0	product was brand_new and very happy with my purchase .
0	ordering was a breeze and delivery turned_up first thing on the day i selected .
0	took a punt on buying from pinesolutions after traipsing about the shops and not finding anything we liked .

0	will buy from again .
0	i ordered a pair of monitor_audio bx0 .
0	they were cheaper there than anywhere_else on the net .
0	next_day delivery was free , which was an added_bonus .
0	unfortunatlly , one of the channels had a problem , so i called them up and they immediatly oragnised a pickup for the next_day , no questions_asked .
0	as soon as they received my return , they called me up to say they were sending me a new pair .
0	all in all , you really couldn_'_t ask more in terms of service ; they are reliable , cheap , quick , and a pleasure to talk to on the phone !
0	matt as parcel0go live help is very helpful and professional .
0	i have dealt_with him a few_times and its been 00 / 00 each time !

0	bo
0	very helpful couldnt_ask for more perfect service thank_you ( samantha )
0	i ordered a jump pack ( fw mkii ) for a conversion i am doing .
0	within 0 working_days order was here :)
0	i '_ve_used the customer service a few_times regarding different problems or requests .
0	each time they have been so helpful getting me over and above what i actually wanted or needed .
0	the service response is instantanious and gives you exactly_what you need every time .
0	there '_s nothing i can fault them on .
0	really awesome style .
0	even if you are not buying you can always look through their blogs on styling tips and learn simple yet effective everyday styles .
0	i can scroll on hours for fashion wear , they vary and range from low to high prices so , it really is for everyone from any background .
0	even if you are not buying you can get a good sense and styling knowledge .
0	order was dealt professionally , i had an issue with it , but they communicated effectively and was sorted_out easily .
0	argos is one of the easiest shops to buy goods , with a simple pre order system as well as checking if your item is in stock at your local_store .
0	the staff are also very helpful , this is another ingredient as to why argos are so much more advanced that any other typical store .
0	i use the chester tesco store , twice a week , it is by far my favourite grocery shop
0	this is bar far my most used search_engine .
0	by far one of my favourite bingo game websites , full of prizes from money to virgin products
0	you won_'_t go_wrong if your experience was anything like mine :
0	+ great value
0	+ quick as hell
0	+ well package
0	+ quality product
0	bookmarked and ready to use again !
0	i am always using abebooks . co . uk , the prices and wide_range are great , and unlike amazon the pricing in very transparent ( no 0p books with high postage_costs !)
0	i '_ve never had a problem with this site .
0	had some trouble logging_into a course , spoke to kathy online ... she had me up and running within a couple of minutes .
0	great job
0	very good range of products and very quick service .
0	i can '_t say anymore
0	just perfect
0	one of the best clothes site services around !
0	had problems from day 0 with this company , ordered and had faults with teh trolley had to push round the course on first try .
0	communication from the guy running it was awful , never calls back and refused to give me a refund .
0	i am_currently taking_legal_action to get my money back .
0	honestly i have never written a bad review before but please for your own sake do not even attempt to buy from this cowboy_outfit , the trolley is poor and their service is the worst i have ever come_across .
0	i had been very happy with the service from the splashbackpeople , quick to respond on email , even at weekends .
0	the splash back did take a couple of weeks to arrive , but more trouble some was that it arrived damaged , a very small dimple in the metal .
0	very annoying .
0	initially the response was good , understanding over the phone and had a good record of my past corespondents .
0	however they soon lost interest and started to give me the run around ..
0	telling_me that a courier was picking it up soon and a replacement would be produced .
0	in the end i got fed_up waiting and just asked for my money back , however they have so_far been unable to do this .
0	in my opinion if you have no_problems with the goods from this company then they are probably ok , but if you experience any_problems then you may aswel set fire to your money .
0	we were after a good quality sign for the house and atlantic_signs had a great site to get the preview then proofing stage via_email .
0	delivery was a week , quick considering it '_s bespoke .
0	it looks fantastic and really sets the house appart .
0	always delivered quickly , knowledgeable_staff always happy to help .
0	i bought a well - priced ( cheap !)
0	cover for my galaxy nexus .
0	i originally made a mistake and had it posted to an old address .
0	the support contact was very helpful and was just offering to send a new one when i spotted my mistake .
0	when the cover arrived it had good finish but creaked ever so slightly and it basically fell_apart within a week ( the first chips appeared on the first day ) and this was not through neglect and maltreatment - it was just day - to - day use .
0	when i complained i was offered a replacement straight_away and received it 0 days_later - we '_ll see how this one goes .
0	so overall , very good service but be wary of what products you buy .
0	expect to get what you pay for .
0	i had a problem with a courrier collecting the wrong item but jenny saved the day and helped resolve the situation .
0	she was friendly and helpful !
0	couldbt have asked for more .
0	i found this website by_accident a year_ago , and boy am i glad !
0	i have always received great service and every purchase was satisfactory .
0	to top it all off , they offer pretty_much the cheapest legal games that i can find .
0	i thoroughly_recommend this website to everyone !
0	i expected a lot of liberty_flights as they have been ' in the game ' for a long time so they must be doing something right which is why i decided to try them and i was not disappointed , i always have 000_% vg ( or close to if we ignore the flavouring ) and was happy to see they offered this in a lot of flavours as most sites don_'_t .
0	my order arrived quickly and while i wasn_'_t 000_% keen on the tobacco_flavour their blueberry and forrest fruits in particular are awesome !, my missus loves the forrest fruits as well , if you make an order definately put a bottle of this in your basket !
0	:-)
0	i ordered the baby elegance cot_bed from bella - bambino . com after i looked_everywhere and they had the best prices & a professional looking webstore .
0	the item arrived after just two_days in perfect_condition as expected .
0	i was updated via_email when the item was shipped etc which i really liked .
0	all together i think this store is great and will be using them again !
0	a +
0	good deals
0	they treat me like a thief and at the end they lost !
0	realy bad !!!!!!!!!!!!
0	avoid they only want your money !!

0	everything happened as quickly and efficiently as i was told it would throughout the sale of my watch , very pleased with the service i received and would definitely recommend watchfinder to anyone
0	i got given an iphone by a mate at school as he couldn_'_t get it to work on orange .
0	i tried my sim in it and it didn_'_t work either .
0	my dad said it was cos the phone was locked and i ' d need to phone the network to get it unlocked .
0	the trouble is we didn_'_t know which network to call .
0	my dad found this site online and sorted everything out with them and it all works now .
0	i am using my pay as you go sim_card in it and can download apps , sms , everything .
0	pretty_cool website - fixed my iphone :)
0	they are still posting on their blog and social_media ?
0	they are still ***** operating ??!
0	!
0	" livingdesign europ " is what showed up on bank_statement as the company if it helps .
0	remember you are fully_protected with " visa_debit " cards these days , not just credit_cards !
0	!
0	i used the online_chat for our business line issue and an engineer is coming to us tomorrow morning .
0	can '_t get a quicker response than that right .
0	thanks .
0	this is the 0nd watch i '_ve bought from watchfinder and once i decided what i wanted , i immediately knew i ' d use watchfinder again for their excellent customer service and product quality .
0	the sales_reps are knowledgable and honest and put you under no pressure to buy and the customer_care team are also helpful and very prompt in their replies .
0	will be happy to use watchfinder next time i look to buy .
0	website is particularly easy to use , love the way u can pick different_combinations and the price difference is shown straight_away .
0	i think it was about 00 days overall from me ordering my laptop to having it delivered .
0	the laptop itself was even better_than i had imagined .
0	the cosmos ii is light and thin , the outer shell attractive and all ports are placed well .
0	keyboard and touchpad both responsove and the setup was a breeze .
0	overall i would have no problem recommending pc_specialist as a way of getting a high end machine at a lower cost without_compromising on the quality
0	good prices , well_packed and quick delivery .
0	all good !
0	two_days delivery from
0	england to n . ireland .
0	i live in the middle of nowhere and always have problems with deliveries from courier companies so i usually take estimated delivery dates with a pinch of salt but true to their word they delivered within 0day slot .
0	emailed in the morn to say would be with me within a certain time and so they where .
0	total pain_free service !
0	few_pounds less_than other_companies offered for the phone but i knew the name and had used before .
0	0 days after i posted phone money was in my bank .
0	couldn_'_t fault them
0	i always pre_- order my ps0_games from simply_games and unlike many other_companies they have never_let_me down .
0	i always get games a day or two early and not once have i had a game turn_up late .
0	for this reason , i occasionally pay a couple of pounds more for pre_- orders with them , but more often than not simply_games are either on par or better_than the competition with their pricing .
0	i can '_t personally vouch for their customer service but my friend had a positive_experience in getting a refund with them .
0	i took a risk using cjs - cdkeys since i '_ve neveer trusted a site that can offer you cheaper games , however the risk paid off .
0	i '_ve now brought my second game from them and it came quick ( if not instant ) as did the first .
0	i would highly_recommend them , save your self a few_bucks :).
0	i '_ve_used amazon for over 0 years and never had a problem with their service .
0	the delivery sometimes is late but is not their fault and if you paid for it they will refund it with no_problems .
0	any time i had to call or web chat they always solved my problem .
0	a bit overpriced but their service is excellent , no problem with returns or rma .
0	i '_ve bought many games from this company and all the keys are sent instantly , not to mention that this is the cheapest place to buy steam or origin_keys .
0	can '_t ask for better .
0	great prices and fast delivery .
0	after paying £_00 for next_day delivery and order it to my work address so i wouldn_'_t have to miss a day of work , nothing shows up .
0	then received and e_- mail saying " we tried to deliver your order from overclockers however there was no one available to sign for the order at the address below ".
0	0st - that '_s a lie because i work at a garage and there '_s always people around who can call me .
0	0nd - no one ever saw anyone from dpd .
0	and it makes me so upset that even after the e_- mail i tried to find a number to call someone from dpd to explain what happen , i couldn_'_t find any number on their web_site .
0	then again it '_s no surprise that with such a crappy service .
0	and again best price available on the internet and the delivery in less_than a minute .
0	a great website easy to use , fast and dedicated staff at hand to help and the delivery is the best i have ever received .
0	just a great all_round company
0	ordered my iphone 0 through the quidco website with the £_00 cash_back advertised .
0	at first i was skeptical with many people saying they didn_'_t receive anything from quidco .
0	however , my experience with quidco was great !
0	no_hassle just ordered and waited for the pounds to roll in !
0	chuffed when £_00 was paid into my account after 0 months !
0	waited over two_weeks for my order and when i opened it i found they had sent me the wrong thing .
0	after talking with their hopeless staff they had agreed to collect the package and give me a refund however , after another week no on came to collect it .
0	after wasting me of my time on the phone to them they sent another courier to collect the parcel .
0	the courier came and i thought that was the end but , after two_weeks no payments have been received .
0	terrible service , terrible company and avoid at all cost !
0	i '_ve been using supplement_warehouse now for a few_years and i have never had a bad_experience .
0	no matter what product i choose to purchase they have always been able to beat any price i have searched for and trust me i '_ve tried .

0	thank_you supwarehouse .

0	budgetair appear to trade under various different guises .
0	booked return flights london to koh samui , via bangkok on british_airways and connecting with bangkok airways .
0	immediately after payment , realised there was a one - character mistake in my surname .
0	despite their booking process clearly not being automated ( our e_- ticket arrived the next_day ) and advising them straight_away , they claimed it would cost about £_000 -£_000 to correct .
0	i contacted british_airways directly and asked what they could do , and they said they would always make changes like this for nothing , but it was an agency booking so budgetair had to instigate the change by calling their helpline .
0	i explained this to budgetair but still they said it would cost £_000 fee .
0	pretty_steep , considering the entire return flight was only about £_000 !
0	eventually i gave up with their call_centre in amsterdam , despite escalating my issue to a ' manager '.
0	to be honest , they had some difficulty completely understanding english .
0	i said i ' d rebook the flights again directly with british_airways and just take them to court ( citing unfair fees ) to get my money back off them .
0	i left it at that , and a few_days_later ( after various token reductions in their fee demand ) miraculously they decided that they could make the change after all at no charge , albeit meaning both people travelling would be on separate bookings ( which was fine ).
0	so it all turned_out ok in the end , but i had to be pretty tough with them to make them play ball , and i expect most people would just allow themselves to be stitched up with unfair and completely unjustified fees .
0	i would have been happy to pay a reasonable fee for the change - it was my mistake after all .
0	also , not entirely budgetair '_s fault , also they failed to mention that our bags would not be checked (' interlined ') all the way through to koh samui , meaning we ' d have to collect them at bangkok and check them back in .
0	despite them sorting everything out , the fact that i had to basically bully / threaten them into it means i can '_t possibly award anything more than 0_star .
0	edit - i felt a bit_harsh for originally awarding them one star and revised it up to two , but since they '_ve left a pretty_useless ' response ' trying to justify their behaviour i '_m putting it back to one again .
0	just brought rome total war 0 for a friend as a birthday_present .
0	i '_m really happy with the service i received .
0	i had to verify my phone number by text but this was no problem at all .
0	it all went through in about 00 seconds .
0	from now on cjs will be my game store of choice .
0	excellent .
0	responded extremely quickly to emails and fantastic customer service .
0	great for a first time buyer needing some answers regarding which sunglasses would be best and they are reasonably_priced , highly_recommend to anyone !
0	i brought a car from trade_centre wales in may i was there for 0 hours waiting for everything to go through i was late for work because the kept me waiting i got the car in the end and traveled home the next_day i noticed that the windscreen had chips and a crack in it the gear box was banging and crunching the oil light kept coming on even known there was oil in the car the air bag light was on saying inspect so i phoned t . c . w about the problems they told me to bring the car back up so they could have a look so i did i was up there for about an_hour they came out to see me and told me the gear box is knackered i said to them well i now that but what about the other stuff and they said there is nothing wrong with it air bag is fine no oil light on so i questioned them and said so your telling_me there is no fault with the air bag even nowing the airbag light comes on and says inspect and they said yes nothing wrong with it so they told me to bring the car up 0_weeks_later to get it sorted which i was not very happy about because they are trying to let the warrrenty run out i then asked if they will pay for my fuel to get back home and back up as its not my fault the car is knackered they said no we dont do that which really put me over the edge i then said see you in 0_weeks so i then went to see the manager about what the mechanic said to me about the airbag like and all and he said he will get on to them and get back to me i said i am not happy with this car and want to change it remember i only had it 0 days they said no you cant change it even knowing they sold me a car that is broken i then questioned them on the 00 point check about the window and the gearbox as they put on there that it was all fine when it wasnt and they said it was fine when they checked it which i think is a load of bull i waited 0 days for the manager to phone me back and he never so i phoned a number of times and he still didnt phone me back so i reported them to trading_standards all i think they are selling dodgy cars i would stay well away because once you get the car you are totally f_** ked so stay well away they are useless and the managers cant even be_arsed to phone you back which just proves a point they now they have done wrong

0	when i first started_vaping , i stumbled_across c0v after being recommended a riva 000 as a good starting_point ...
0	i had a few questions and e_- mailed them , the response was almost_immediate and it was well out of working hours ...
0	which i was amazed at .
0	i had a doa atomiser with my starter_kit , they sent me out a replacement no_problems ..
0	i wanted a less fiddly approach they pointed me toward the vison clearos which have been great ... as a complete newb , knowing that i will always get customer_orientated advice has kept me coming_back ... just bought from them again , shipping time very good ... as usual fantastic customer service ...
0	i would suggest them to everyone , whether new to the vape estate ... or if you '_ve been at it for a while , it '_s a great company ...

0	i addressed in this company the first time and , believe me , it was pleasantly_surprised with professionalism of people which here work .
0	the order was delivered when should .
0	as i am in other country , i can not check everything , now i don_'_t worry_about it , i can trust in eflorist !!!
0	good fellows !
0	trying to make changes to my booking involved endless referrals on their helpline , all resulting in being cut - off or sent to a voicemail_message .
0	the one person that sounded_like he knew what he was talking_about said it was a bad line ( i could hear him perfectly ), told me he ' d call me back , but never did .
0	no games anymore , so cancelled my 0 year long subscription .
0	business suicide .
0	i ordered my product on a tuesday with hopes of delivery for the friday .
0	i picked_up my puppy on the friday with no sign of puppy_food from yourselves .
0	as it was a double bank_holiday ( queens jubilee ) i accepted this and didn_'_t think about it again until te following thursday .
0	still no sign of my product .
0	i then rang customer_services and was promptly informed that i hadn_'_t paid for my product and this is why i hadn_'_t yet received it .
0	0 minutes later i provided my paypal payment confirmation details and was then told that there had been a mistake between paypal and yourselves but confirmed i had actually paid for the product and it would be dispatched the next_day as a priority .
0	at which point it was then said that in future i needed to check my order statuses changed from received to processed , as though it was my responsibility to check your back office were doing their job correctly .
0	i felt this was quite rude .
0	further to this , one week_later i get a knock on the door from a neighbour who took_ownership of my eventual delivery 0 days prior as i had been out at time of delivery but courier didn_'_t leave a ' i missed you note ' so i we unaware of this .
0	your prices are great but your system is flawed beyond function
0	was very happy to find christmas_pressie at a great price and to receive it within a day !
0	product looks great , packaged well and was kept up to date from sale to delivery .
0	pleasure to do_business with
0	price lower_than anywhere_else so was a bit_sceptical_about delivery .
0	was blown_away by the excellent communication and speed at which item was delivered .
0	absolutely will deal with again
0	i have been using the asda grocery delivery service for the last_year as my local asda is miles_away and as i do monthly grocery_shopping , found it a convenient solution to long shopping excursions with limited time .
0	despite my first delivery from asda being absolutely disastrous as the driver forgot to unload all the fresh good , the situation was eventually resolved through a refund and £ 0 evoucher for the inconvenience , i decided to give them another change .
0	unfortunately this seems to have been a misguided notion as last night i was called by the delivery driver 00_minutes before my delivery window would finish ( 00 : 00 ) to be told that the vehicle has broken down and as it is not store policy to redeliver , i will be receiving a refund after which i can place a new order .
0	as a student with a small family , my finances are very limited and thus i purchase my monthly groceries to be sufficient for the month before paying all other bills .
0	thus i don_'_t have another £_000 to pay for another grocery delivery until the money is refunded .
0	i do understand that vehicle breakdowns are beyond anybody '_s control , but am not understanding of the fact that asda does not rectify their failure by arranging for a re - delivery at the earliest convenience .
0	to make_matters_worse , when contacting the customer service center this morning to discuss this matter , i was informed that it shouldn_'_t take longer_than 0 days and after becoming rather adamant that i do still require the delivery or require the money to be refunded in a manner that i can receive it earlier , i was told that they would call the store to see whether they are ' willing ' to ' help me out ' after which they would contact me immediately to notify_me of the decision .
0	five hours_later i have still not received a call and called the customer service team again to be told that they do not know what has_been done about the earlier call or email that i sent and repeated the whole_process from 0 hours earlier .
0	fortunately this assistant was a little more helpful as she called me within ten_minutes to inform_me that she has spoken to a picking assistant that now needs to speak to his manager to find out whether they can once again attempt to ' accommodate ' me .
0	two hours_later i have still not received a phone_call thus meaning that i will possibly have to try to borrow money to feed my family for the weekend and beyond until i can actually purchase my intended items from a different company .
0	after this experience , i can only_assume that my £ 0000 p . a grocery_shopping that have mostly been spent at asda is too insignificant to warrant any form of customer_care and as such i am happy to let my feet do the talking to a different retails .
0	advice : plan for the good and bad_experiences with asda because as a whole the good is ok and the bad is an example of absolutely horrible customer service !
0	!
0	i have retracted my prior statement .
0	an aria cs team member has_gone to great lengths to resolve this issue with me .
0	i commend him for doing so .
0	the only issue i had was with the initial response with my query .
0	they got good games , fast responses to e_- mails and a nice serve .
0	what do you want more :)
0	the site itself is very well set_up and i use it over hostelworld ( my first time booking_hostels ).
0	really like the " show map " option in which you just hover your mouse over the words and it shows you a small idea of where the place is on a little google_map .
0	it '_s also nice to click on the " show_room types " to see what kind of rooms they have without having to click and load / reload the page .
0	overall , a very simple and easy process of booking !
0	i '_ll be making_sure to write detailed reviews of hostels so my experience can help people make_decisions like me !
0	before i decided to go for this website , i was looking at many other_sites and this page looked very promising and i thought that i need to talk to someone before going ahead .
0	i phoned up and one of the operators explained how it worked .
0	i did go for it and like they said , within 00_hours had my iphone_unlocked .
0	easy done , didn_'_t have to send my phone anywhere and yes ,,, very , very happy .
0	thank_you !
0	i '_m using the service to transfer money to my own account in finland from uk .
0	the cost and speed of my banks is appalling compared to this .
0	would prefer setting this up with my friends if my friend had not recommended me to try transferwise .
0	it was easy to setup a new transfer and paying it with my debit_card .
0	i '_ve been using the service only few_times , but the money has transferred to my bank_account before the estimated time .
0	i recommend this to any of my friends .
0	i ordered a micro scooter black as it was the cheapest and it had free delivery but 0 days_later i tried to make contact and there was no number to call so had to email them which took 0 days for a reply to then be told that the item was out of stock and was being sent straight from the manufactures .
0	0 days_later i revived my goods , i would pay a little extra and use another company so that i could get a tracking_number ...
0	the guys at watch_finder were a pleasure to work with , i was interested in a rolex explore which they contacted me as soon as they had one in stock .
0	the watch arrived 0am the next_day which was a saturday .
0	it was in a0_condition and i couldn_'_t be_happier .
0	i am still_waiting for my order and the company just refuse to reply or respond .
0	do not fall for the ever so nice website .
0	took my money and that '_s it .
0	criminals and scum .
0	i have never had a problem with quidco and the cashback always tracks very quickly - alot quicker_than other cashback_sites .
0	their cashback is always very competitive and i end up using them alot more than others .
0	i would rate this the number 0 cashback site in the uk
0	i '_ve_used hippobag / hippowaste 0 times now and each and everytime i '_ve been thoroughly impressed .
0	my property isn_'_t the easiest one to collect the hippobag from however they '_ve never struggled .
0	i thoroughly_recommend these_guys and if you ' re considering a skip then don_'_t !!
0	get these_guys instead !
0	looking through all the other reviews i was very hesitant to order from these_guys but , after_speaking to a friend who has used them , i did ....
0	i must_say that i '_m very impressed .
0	i ordered my iphone0s later afternoon and it arrived the next_day ( as promised ).
0	i wasn_'_t in for delivery but they just left it at the post_office for me to collect which is only 0 minutes down the road .
0	contract seems to have been set_up correctly and i spoke with orange yesterday to give them my pac_code - all seems fine .
0	i think you should ignore most of the comments on this page relating to delivery problems and communication problems .
0	most , as you '_ll see , are over christmas and this company is relatively_small and they are also only as good as their courier .... most couriers are shocking over christmas and mess things up .
0	mpd are by far the cheapest i could_find for the iphone plus they give cashback on topcashback and / or quidco .
0	i say give them a go and you won_'_t be disappointed .
0	trust me !
0	this company is part of an organisation that owns many bad carparking companies .
0	including kkarparks ltd . more car parking .
0	airport_parking choices and comparemeetandgreet .
0	do not use them under any circumstances as i promise you you '_ll be disappointed .
0	we had to cancel our appointment with them and , to this date , have not had a refund .
0	they have even gone to the trouble to cancel the email address that we were given for contacting them
0	this company and any company associated to it is completely illegal and will either park your car in an unsafe place or they will steal your money .
0	do not use .
0	this is a complete and utter scam .
0	they are not a real car parking company and are not supported_by any organisations that regulates car parking .
0	all companies that show up under their " compare " are part of their " group " of scam companies .
0	they will not park your car in a secure place .
0	we cancelled the agreement with them as we saw many bad_reviews about one of their other_websites and have never , to this day , received a refund .
0	they '_ve even deleted the email address we had for contacting them .
0	absolutely_shocking .

0	i have been using supplement_warehouse for as long as i can remember .
0	i can always count on them to have everything in stock that i need and a a great price .

0	thanks for everything supplement_warehouse and i will always be a loyal_customer .
0	ps0 developed rlod syndrome , gave chris a call , got an appointment for the following_day ( phoned late evening ).
0	ps0 was fixed after an_hour !
0	great and friendly service !
0	will_definitely be the first place to go to for all console related problems and will be the first place to be recommended !
0	thanks for the service , well_worth the money !
0	pretty simple and clean designed website and excellent prices .
0	if you think those aren_'_t the most_important site features desired for someone booking an hotel / hostel in europe from south_america then you are missing out a fantastic tool to plan your travels , particularly if you are planning for a group .
0	three stars just because my order took 0 days to be dispatched due to an error , everything else was great including the customer service guys who i spoke to .
0	i have ordered many things from hifiheadphones and that will_continue for a very very long time .
0	i genuinely have not dealt_with another company that has given better service .
0	the one time i had a fault with a product , it was replaced quickly , efficiently and without_any hassle at all .
0	even ended_up having a lengthy conversation about various headphone / hifi things with the guy on the phone .
0	they properly know their stuff and are friendly and knowledgeable with it - not arrogant and pushy in the slightest .
0	you can see from the other reviews here exactly how great this company are .
0	i see no other choice for my headphone needs !
0	good website , fast delivery , friendly & helpful staff .
0	what more can you ask for really ?
0	very happy with the service provided .
0	i needed a clock asap as i had forgotten to buy a present for my friend .
0	they processed and delivered the clock the next_day !
0	truly excellent service .
0	firstly , mazuma offered the best price for recycling the phone i had out of any of the other recycling_websites .
0	the phone i had also had a shattered screen , which several other_websites would not accept , but mazuma did .
0	i recieved the free_postage envelope quickly , and they recieved the phone quickly after i posted it .
0	i was then paid ... quickly .
0	thanks for doing what you say you will mazuma .
0	i bought a samsung_galaxy s 0 from buymobilephones recently .
0	it was the joint cheapest place on the contract i wanted with a couple other_places , but buymobilephones give quidco_cashback so i went with them .
0	many quidco reviews state they never recieved their cashback from this company , but i guess i '_ll have to wait and see for myself .
0	firstly , the website has a slightly seedy vibe about it which i can only say comes from experience if you have been on any malware ridden sites offering ' free games ' or whatever .
0	buymobilephones of course didn_'_t have any malware or popups that i am aware of but it '_s not a good frontage for a site for first_impressions .
0	when placing my order , they underhandedly tried to shovel in some free for first month ( very expensive after that ) insurance by default in small letters , which i managed to take out of the shopping_basket but i can see a lot of people falling for that .
0	there was also a ' choose free_gift with your phone ' option when choosing a phone to buy , which in fact just gives you an expensive item along with the phone the cost of which is added onto your contract , so rather_than free it '_s just a pay monthly item .
0	quite obvious to me but it '_s more underhanded work which would catch out the less observant of us .
0	now , once i placed my order my phone actually arrived very quickly which i was pleased about , and i '_m pleased with the phone .
0	however , the usb_cable that came with the phone does not work and i am having to borrow one off a friend .
0	i sent them an email about this a week_ago and have still not recieved a reply .
0	worse , if you urgently need to get hold of them by phone , their phone number is a premium_rate number .
0	i have to give three stars because i got the phone i wanted at the price i wanted , and quickly .
0	but the overall ordering experience was bad , it had me paranoid they were going to catch me out with something and of course i have this non working usb_cable that came with my phone and no timely support for it , perhaps they are waiting to see if i '_ll call their premium_rate number .
0	we have been for 0 year with this company .
0	the whole year is bad_experience .
0	when agreement between payment sense and us was made - they say : no rolling_contract and hidden_fees , standard payment all the time which was agreed over the phone , free cancellation any day or time .
0	after agreement was made - that '_s where all problems started : the agreed charge was triple ( they started to divide the agreed charge by a few different accounts and merchants and tried to explain that these are all different things which were extra charged - this was never explained .
0	customer service - horrible - they never call you back after agreement is made and you start paying .
0	and finally , when you try to cancel their services - they are not helpful by making you stay for another 00 days as cancellation period - so you must pay them even_though the service is not used .
0	when you consider someone for long_term and with good operation and service - i would never recommend them to anyone .
0	please have a look at [_external_reference_]

0	i have used funky pigeon many_times over the past couple of years , and have bought cards , calendars and iphone covers .

0	i '_ve been without signal for over 0_weeks now .
0	originally i thought nothing of it , because i figured any_issues would be solved fairly quickly .
0	how wrong i was .
0	i tweeted their " customer_services " team who asked for a postcode .
0	i gave them it and they provided a vague response that said there was a fault with a mast and they were working to fix it .
0	0_weeks down the line and many tweets asking for more information have received the same response .
0	my signal finally came back last friday for about a day ... then a pigeon flew into the mast or something and i '_m left without signal again .
0	i '_m not happy paying £_00 for this service , so i enquired_about reducing it for this month .
0	i ended_up on the phone to and indian_call_centre , were the operator could understand me , and i couldn_'_t understand him .
0	so i gave up .
0	i was then encouraged by three '_s official twitter_page to file a complaint on their website .
0	that was a week_ago and i '_ve heard_nothing from them .
0	i '_ve still got about 00 months on my contract with them , but i '_m more than tempted to fork_out how ever many hundreds of pounds it '_ll cost to be rid of them for good .
0	disgraceful company .
0	i ordered my pc from pcs just after christmas , i .
0	was aware of their limited opening times over the christmas_period so once the first working day came along i upgraded my order to 0 day dispatch .
0	i was called from pcs a few hours_later to explain they were picking my order and that there was an issue with they graphics_card i had chosen .
0	unfortunately it would not fit into the case i wanted so i swapped that out over the phone and the pc was built that day , went into testing and dispatched for the next_day .
0	the delivery service pcs use is dpd and i have had no issues with them whatsoever , they offer a one hour delivery slot and i could even track my package as the driver made his route .
0	all in all i would highly_recommend pcs , speedy service , polite communication , help when you need it and excellent value .
0	never used simplycdkeys before but i would certainly use them again , they were cheap , efficient and very fast with the delivery of the key .
0	the website is extremely easy to use and everything is done securely .
0	you can even pay with paypal .
0	we ordered blinds from blinds0go . co . uk having found them using a search_engine .
0	we were looking for some specific colours in black - out - blinds style and found the selection available to be superb .
0	we first ordered some samples which were sent out immediately and delivered within 0 days and once we were happy with our selections our order was placed .
0	we were kept_informed via_email of the status of our order and the blinds were dispatched and delivered very quickly .
0	couldn_'_t fault them .
0	the post sale service is amazing , there was a problem with the product but it was resolved quickly .
0	good communication as well :)

0	made a review earlier , had apologies and now today '_s booking hasn_'_t turned_up .
0	i am not shocked , interparcel is really struggling at the moment .
0	best to go_elsewhere whilst they sort themselves out .
0	ordered a vapourlites replacement that arrived much_faster_than i expected and havent had a cigarette_since !
0	everything i '_ve ever needed i '_ve been able to find at supplement_warehouse .

0	good choice to buy from them
0	after dealing_with money_grabbing local_estate_agents for years i finally took the plunge and picked housenetwork to sell my latest property online .
0	from the inital phone_call , the amazing pictures and the marketing package they put_together to the 0st_class customer service including your own personal account_manager they were simply amazing .
0	and to top it all off they only charged a 0rd of what i would have paid to a local_estate_agent .
0	stop thinking_about it and go for it they ' re worth their weight in gold .
0	feel free to use this 0 % code they gave_me yuigigbnjh
0	only had the laptop just over a week , first_impressions ... impressive .

0	m briggs
0	happy with the price .
0	fast transaction .
0	received money bang on when they said .
0	would recommend to any0 !
0	really please
0	their product does not work well .
0	the instructions they give you for their site are not even written for the software they provide you with
0	they signed me up for an annual service and never tell you it is a two year contract .
0	just read all the other reviews on them .
0	i can only think that the couple of positive_reviews are written by themselves .
0	as i said , i did not know it was a two year contract as they never mentioned it at all .
0	to add_insult to injury they have now charged me for the 0nd year , only 0 months in to the first year .
0	they said they sent a letter which was a notice to charge my card 0_weeks_ago but this is not true .
0	they are in breach of contract
0	they would not talk to me on the phone - a lady_called lynne fletcher who is the renewals manager : tel : 00000000000 refused to speak to me , leaving her subordinate under her direction to inform_me to fill in their online complaints form ( which is worrying that they would need one anyway !!!)
0	on the complaints form i asked her to call me but she just replied_saying they were not in the wrong and just to email her if i was not happy .
0	i have now approached hsbc to refund my transaction .
0	if you have had similar problems , please report them at first to citizens_advice on + 00 ( 0 ) 000 000 0000 , it only take a few minutes and the more complaints they get , the more likely it is these_guys will stop ripping_people off .
0	was booking a parcel going to zambia for work and kept getting an error_message ,
0	i spoke to very helpful and funny lady_called cathrine who sorted_out a problem via the live_chat , i had to wait a little_bit but was offered a small discount which was very nice .
0	nice to speak to someone with a personality not not just a yes / no policy robot .
0	will_definately_use again .
0	the website was by far better then i rest i found .
0	the hover over the map link was definetly beneficial when trying to find a place in the loaction i wanted .
0	trailfinders managed to get excellent deals through korean airlines to nz for us and managed to hold the flights for six_months before we had to pay .
0	unfortunately the airline did change their billing requirements which meant we had to pay early but trailfinders kept us updated and managed the issue .
0	one thing though if you book make_sure you request to be seated together , we managed to get separated on the flight as they had us down as two window seats despite the fact we we ' re returning to nz to get married .
0	0 provides almost acceptable network quality in central_london but intermittent cut_outs become frustrating during_peak_times .
0	in terms of managing an account they do a reasonable job but continued up selling becomes tiresome quickly ( esp mobile_broadband ).
0	it works most of the time and the prices are ok , want more than this and you will be left wanting .
0	easy to use , quality and price point bang on the money ( my money )
0	exactly_what i said above .
0	unbeatable prices with same day despatch and even on standard delivery , our order was delivered the next_day .
0	i like the fact invoices are emailed once despatched .
0	we '_ve been using printing . com cambridge office as our main printing supplier for the past few_years .
0	billy and matt are always happy to help and offer the best prices around with a super_fast turnaround .
0	xbox one delivered on launch day 0 minutes into my designated confirmed delivery slot , full communication via e_- mails and text informing_me as to the whereabouts of my xbox .

0	the only site to get all of your iphone_unlocking needs is the officialiphoneunlock . co . uk .
0	this site is a trusted , relyable and will permanently factory_unlock any iphone you have . hi im from the island of trinidad and tobago and i have a iphone_0s that was locked to rogers canada , there was no jailbreak to get my phone unlock and i was not going to spend a set of money to buy those gevey sims that only tempory unlock iphones . serching for a unlock for my iphone i stumbled_upon this site .. officialiphoneunlock . co . uk ... now i have a permanent factory_unlock iphone that could work with any sim_cards in my country and around the world and it will stay unlock even if i upgrade my iphone ... thanks guys keep_up the good work ..
0	it was all very easy to use , and simple to fill in the on line form .
0	i couldn_'_t believe_how fast the free envolope arrived and then how quickly the cheque arrived .
0	so easy so fast , do it !
0	nothing i can complain_about , greta product , great price and great and very fast service .
0	great prices , tons of free goods , quick and easy check out .
0	could use a little help on shipping prices but all the free stuff makes up for most of it .
0	ordered a headboard and it looks great .
0	the live_chat help provided by diamond_geezer was invaluable when choosing a ring to propose with .
0	my wife was delighted with the results and they took all the comments i had got from her to come up with the correct design .
0	prices were very fair too .
0	even once the sale had been made and money paid service remained good when we had to get the ring_resized .
0	very happy and recommended to other friends on the cusp of proposal ...
0	we have been with fu for just over a year now , and twice in the past year , we have not only been accused of not paying our bill , but on several_occasions have failed to even receive a bill .
0	we received plenty of correspondence when they thought we hadn_'_t paid our bill , when we rang them up about the latter , after confirming with the bank that it had been paid , they told us the money had been paid and they informed us that they never said we hadn_'_t paid it , even_though we had been receiving letters from solicitors acting on their behalf claiming we hadn_'_t paid it .
0	we have now got another solicitors letter claiming that once again we have not paid them £_000 . 00 when in actual fact we have paid it and are in possession of receipts proving this , will be ringing them on monday and recording any calls we exchange .
0	its an_absolute travesty and we are seriously_considering switching providers .
0	adam tyreman
0	supper_fast and helped a lot
0	came fast is what it said and got my cash_back thanks
0	0 times canceled for no reson
0	nice way to book a travel not bothering much about finding some buttons , or that your card won_'_t be accepted or something else will happen
0	thanks guys .
0	my 0gs is now unlocked and my orange simcard is now working without the aid of temporary jailbreaks .
0	ordered sunday , received unlock confirmation on thursday .
0	if you do have a phone that has jailbreak software on it , the process may be slightly_different .
0	in my case i was on firmware from 0000 ( v0 . 0 . 0 ).
0	itunes told me i had to restore to factory_settings and then my firmware was updated .
0	bit_annoying as i '_ve had to spend a couple of hours in the app store and i '_ve lost paid apps .
0	there may be a solution to this that i '_ve missed .
0	i suggest if you have any questions - email officialiphoneunlock before you buy .
0	wish i knew about this service earlier
0	we used to use farnell for all our purchases of electrical components .
0	however in september they introduced a " handling charge " of £ 0 . 00 on small orders , with no warning .
0	the " shipping " is free but the information on the website is very unclear , and for most people the distinction between shipping and handling is irrelevant .
0	prior to this new charge , i would have given them 0_stars , in large part because it gives the flexibility to order things when you think of it , instead of waiting to build up sufficient order size .
0	searching their site can be painful , but their live_chat tech_support are very good at the search part .
0	farnell - if you read this , think again .
0	in the meantime , i '_m off to find a new supplier .
0	i used_transferwise to convert money from gbp to eur .
0	the transfer was simple to book , you can transfer the money easily to their uk bank for free , and the conversion happened within 0 days and was in my bank in estonia .
0	the fees were very reasonable , the exchange_rate better_than you would get anywhere_else .
0	can '_t_argue with that .
0	i '_ve not had to shop through hmv that much and to be honest , i '_m quite happy of that fact .
0	i only used them once online and that was more than enough for me .
0	bought myself an xbox_000 with 0 games as a bundle pack , thought i would treat_myself .
0	well i placed the order , a timeslot of 0 - 0 days for delivery " great !"
0	i thought ... and that was the first mistake .
0	the 0th day came , nothing through the post or any attempted deliveries , i thought i would just give them benefit of christmas deliveries as it was around that time ... finally on the 0th day after delivery i got something but was way too small for the xbox_000 ... i got one of the games from the bundle ... ok , so where is the rest of it ?
0	surely as a bundle offer it should all come together .
0	i didn_'_t make an issue as the next_day the actual xbox_000 came along , but where was the other game ?... it didnt arrive until another 0_weeks had gone by , so in the end for everything to get to me , it took 00 days .
0	faaaar from the best service i should be expecting .
0	again this was a while back but i still won_'_t buy anything online from them .
0	another bad_experience was that of my sister ordering a shirt from them quite a few_months back .
0	somehow , and i have no idea how , the order itself just disappeared from the system , called hmv and they claimed they never got it , yet the money easily went from her account ... naturally one very p * ssed off sister .
0	if you can avoid it , don_'_t order online with them , all you will get at the least is long delays for your item to come .
0	another thing i '_ve noticed , and i hope this isn_'_t just me , is that the prices online are often different from the prices instore .
0	a quick example .
0	xbox_000 transfer kit .
0	online - £_00 . 00 .
0	in - store - £_00 . 00 ... which leads me onto the prices themselves .
0	in comparison to other major outlets , such as play . com , amazon etc they are often overpriced for the majority of things they sell and have been criticised several_times for not even having the correct price on their in - store items ( my dad got a cheaper cd when the cashier informed him the price was wrong but still gave him the lower price but besides the point , surely this isn_'_t how a business should actually operate ).
0	on the plus_side , they are often pretty good for stock control both online and in - store and the staff are generally helpful so i guess you could consider hmv a fall back option if any of the better places to go are unable to fulfil your query .
0	i could rate less but it has_been a little while since i used hmv and i don_'_t want to be completely biased based on family experiences but i still hear the same issues being raised , especially with the slow delivery .
0	hmv just needs to focus there , as well as on their pricing strategies .
0	when i lived at home with the family ( before mum actually checked to see if asda delivered to our area ) we would get deliveries from tesco , suually my responsiblity to take everything in when everyone_else had buggered off .
0	the delivery person , in my experience , has always been very friendly and cheerful so no problem there , a few substitutions of products here and there but they stick to what they say that , if the replacement costs more than the original , no extra_charge will be placed so that is always great .
0	not a single delivery has arrived later than stated as well so what more could you want from them ?
0	later down the line and now living in a student house for university i gave them a full use for myself a few weeks_ago , ordering groceries online , requesting the delivery slot and the like .
0	all absolutely easy and no issues_whatsoever .
0	with special_offers , if you request a delivery outside of that special_offer timeslot it does inform you that the deal will not be available so they don_'_t try to hide costs from you .
0	when the delivery arrived the gentleman ran through the list of what had been received and how it works ( because it was my first time to order myself ), not a single substitution made and for the tip of the iceberg , he even offered to carry everything into the kitchen for me !
0	i declined but regardless it shows that the staff themselves are able to go beyond their duty if they so wish .
0	all in all , a great service , cheap , easy to use and polite and friendly staff , fantastic !
0	super useful_information from product , to instructions to customer feedback .
0	click to buy anyway you like paypal , cc etc .
0	easy layout , good search options and sorting of products .
0	excellent offers ( i . e .
0	free delivery ).
0	amazing free_samples lets you try things you might never try otherwise .
0	care in packaging ( eco friendly ), prompt delivery , everything always comes nicely_wrapped .
0	top bananas .
0	i love supplement_warehouse .
0	the shipping may be expensive , but all of the giveaways , discounts , and free_samples and merchandise makes up for that .
0	love the price match_feature , so you know that your getting the best price possible for the products you are purchasing .
0	have had no_problems using this site so_far .
0	love it !

0	i needed to find a hostel that was adaquate and cheap for a few_days in spain until i found a flat .
0	hostelbookers allowed_me to find the perfect hostel , see it on a map , compare prices and read many reviews .
0	they also have a handy insurance feature .
0	great all_round .
0	flying out to a wedding on may 0rd and guess_what ... our flight was cancelled and opodo booked as another flight that was 0 hours_later !!
0	we have to wait in paris for 0 hrs whereas we booked it specifically for only a 0 hour wait ... obviously we will miss the wedding !
0	now i have been on the phone for the last 00_mins trying to call their customer service line which costs . 00 cents a minute !!
0	!
0	all i hear is their terrible hold music ... which i can describe as being even more painful than waiting and knowing my money is going down the drain .
0	you suck opodo ... never using you ever again .
0	vincent
0	i '_ve made a number of expensive purchases since_0000 and to date i haven_'_t been disappointed in the service i '_ve received .
0	specifically with a particularly large order ; matt was very understanding and took great lengths to ensure i received the best possible service .
0	it may be somewhat of a lottery to get the rare bits you want at times , but that '_s only because model_bits can be counted on to stock the very best at excellent prices which means his wares are always in demand .
0	rightly so too , i highly_recommend this business .
0	the service has_been ok , until i lost my phone .
0	i called their support to block the sim_card , and i was told it was impossible to block the sim_card right away , i would have to rely_on an automatic auto - blocking after 0 months of non usage ... so somebody might be using my phone right now , preventing the auto - blocking !
0	i paid a premier service for a shipment from us to uk and here are some interesting discoveries i have made with the tracking no .
0	0 .
0	it takes 0 days for the parcel to be delivered to uk by usps for a 0000 mile long journey .
0	0 .
0	it takes 0 days for the uk custom to clear it .
0	0 .
0	it takes 0 days and ticking for parcelforce to deliver custom notice with the depot 0 miles from my doorstep .
0	they are also shameless enough to charge an 0 pound process fee for that .
0	it is safely say this company has all the incompetent and ignorant sides of royal_mail which in turn is usually an excellent service provider .
0	the miracle of their survival is totally based on the unfair competition of using the royal_mail ’_s existing network and infrastructures which are not available to other very hardworking , organized and responsive services .
0	they won_’_t survive for a day without the support of royal_mail given the service they provide and the fee they charge .
0	in short , they are shite !
0	the reason_why people find this company useful is when they try to sort_out the lowest_price this company usually pops_up .
0	however , they are cheap for a reason .
0	they don_'_t have their logistic supply chains , thus they don_'_t get a hold of the goods they sell .
0	all they do is they phone a real supplier company and let them ship the goods .
0	as you would imagine , buying process could become more complicated with extra parties_involved .
0	if crescentelectronic can ’_t acquire your order they will just send you a preformatted email_telling you they don_’_t have that in stock leaving you wondering what about those stock numbers ?
0	don_'_t you never ever trust their stock numbers , they are all wrong and they want it that way so that you can prepay confidently .
0	surely they know orders will most_likely get delayed and they even have preformatted emails to explain that .
0	if you are not a few quids short , do not buy from this company , especially you are buying for a production environment .
0	they can get you fired .
0	their rma process is problematic as well .
0	i bought 0 wd re0 0tb enterprise class hard_disks for a raid0 array built .
0	with a very rare luck , 0 of them are dead on arrival .
0	the rma went on well until the replacement disks arrived a few weeks_later .
0	first of all , the disks are not sent by crescent electronic and are sent by another company - the actual supplier of the disks .
0	second of all , the supplier company sent some overall 00 pounds_cheaper caviar wd blue 0tb consumer class disks for replacements ( we will call this company the 0nd company for short ).
0	correct me if i am wrong , people generally would expect to get a bmw 0 series back if they send in a bmw 0 series for replacements , wouldn_'_t they ?
0	well , i got lucky and i got a vauxhall_astra back !
0	i phoned the 0nd company trying to tell them how ridicilous is that and a young_girl in her 00s picked_up the phone telling_me “ those enterprise disks are out of stock so they decided to send me these ”.
0	from the fair natural way she talks about it i decided not to argue with the people with the wrong logic to start with .
0	it is not my responsibility to stop them from destroying themselves .
0	i contacted the crescent electronic again to get things sorted .
0	with countless_emails , waiting and worrying for a month and a half i finally got my refund .
0	this is really a classic scenario when things go_wrong , you would be left in this time and money wasting triangle relationship crescent electronic has very successfully implied .
0	i felt that with this sort of experience a 0_star would be an overstatement , 0_star would be proper .
0	however , with the fact that i got the refund i will give them 0 extra star , no more .
0	0000 00 00 update ,
0	i revised the 0_star_rating to 0_star as crescentelectronic is trying to cover up my very honest review .
0	the staffs of boston_limited are very resourceful and helpful .
0	items ordered arrived in a blazing fast speed and currently_awaiting for second despatch .
0	they stock some of the smallest supermicro chassis accessories e . g .
0	a dvd bezel to whole server arrays .
0	if you are building supermicro systems , this dealer is the only and good choice in the uk .
0	ii felt this is a company with service in mind .
0	i put my enquiry of sas cable on the web and they phoned back within 0 hours .
0	very helpful and informative responses as well .
0	generally_speaking , i will shop with them again .
0	yet to stress test an online dealer the best way is going through their return process , that is something i am yet to do ( i hope i don_’_t have to ).
0	hence this review can not give an account for that .
0	unlike various other key sites , oks has always provided a quick and efficient service .
0	every key i have bought from them has_been delivered within ~ 00_minutes , usually closer to 0 minutes .
0	all keys have worked without_any hiccups or issues .
0	preordered my xbox one with these_guys and they were great .
0	they kept me updated on my order all the way through launch , offered me options to modify my order and gave_me a very accurate 0hr time_slot for delivery .
0	i was really impressed at the level of communication and speed of service .
0	good stuff .
0	had a problem at the start '' my fault giving wrong phone number '' but it was sorted_out really fast and i got a great deal : d
0	00 / 00 would bang
0	highly_recommended
0	purchased a pc for one of my small business clients .
0	great value , especially as it '_s backed by a warranty .
0	ordered wednesday_night , delivered friday_morning with excellent to - the - hour tracking_information .
0	can '_t fault the service or value , definitely recommended .
0	the company provide an great service for a good price .
0	if you ever have a problem , they are fast and efficient in helping you , especially if you use the " live help " option .
0	however , a third_party soils their good name , that third_party is yodel .
0	yodel damaged my parcel when it was being delivered , i was forced to return the contents to the seller , he arranged_collection , again , through yodel , and they failed to arrive at all !
0	the following_day , he rearranged collection with tnt and i '_ll be ...
0	they didn_'_t seem to have a problem with collecting a parcel .
0	a far_superior company .
0	my live_chat with emily was fast and solved the problem in a matter of moments .
0	conclusion ; highly recomment p0g but avoid using yodel where possible .
0	so i joined on an 00 month_contract , mobile_broadband device / myfi , it '_s the dongle that lets you connect up 0 separate devices to it at any one time , around £_00 per_month including_vat .... sounds great right ?
0	errrrm no !
0	i had issues maybe a 0 - 0 times a month and for a week at a time .
0	connection would stop , signal would fail and here '_s the catch , anytime i called customer service i would spend maybe 00_minutes a time talking to people who honestly didn_'_t care , couldn_'_t help , asked me to reset my device then passed me on to someone_else .
0	i '_ve been left flabbergasted at some of the lame_excuses & responses i got from people who shouldn_'_t work in customer_support roles - they didn_'_t have a clue !
0	i '_m not sure what database or system they use but like other customers have said , nothing seems to be recorded so everyone i get passed to , i have to explain the whole situation again from_start to finish ... how frustrating !!
0	but on top of that , by the end of my phone_call , no one has ever been able to help or resolve my issues !
0	pretty_much no one really cared !
0	this is not about a call_centre being in india , there are many companies with great call_centres abroad in india and other_countries ... this is about a call_centre with staff who don_'_t care , maybe don_'_t have the right training , maybe are not set any targets or are not monitored or just don_'_t get feedback about their poor performance .
0	however i can '_t blame the call_centre staff as its the companies job to install values , ways of working & expectations !!
0	for this reason the senior members , directors , ceo '_s , owners should be_ashamed of how you run your business and what you see as acceptable ... you may think you have a great product but just read all your poor reviews week after week .... surely you have some integrity , some part of you that says " hold up , something really is wrong here " ???
0	you work in an industry where customers should be the most_important part of everything you do !
0	without us , you will lose out in the long run !
0	just look at how many people have said that they will never use you again , or who want to cancel their contracts .... still you do nothing .
0	i '_m currently a three customer , not out of choice but because you make it so hard for me to cancel , however my contract is up in 0 months and let_me tell you , ill celebrate that date when it arrives and then take my custom and hard_earned_money somewhere_else , to a provider that actually values me !
0	i '_m_sure it won_'_t be too long before you all come unstuck .... good luck with that !
0	oh & to any other customer who is thinking_about joining three for broadband or a dongle or even myfi ..... please don_'_t !
0	you will not just regret it , it will frustrate you for the entire length of your contract !!!
0	oh & guess_what my new months data_allowance was meant to start today !
0	0th of every_month .... but you guessed it !
0	yep , it doesn_'_t work .... no_surprises there .
0	no one at three will care because i '_ve paid already !
0	great business model they have !
0	absolute bunch of clowns !
0	i have only bought one thing from myprotein , i don_'_t wish to be bombarded with reviews .
0	i took a three year_old tag with a misaligned hour hand into the shop , expecting to be sneered at slightly given that my watch is probably worth about a tenth of their average sale .
0	instead i was met by a polite and friendly assistant who referred the watch to the horologist .
0	in short , the watch was fixed on the spot in 00_minutes for a price far cheaper_than quoted elsewhere with some advice on the general condition and how to ensure it doesn_'_t happen again .
0	cannot recommend highly_enough .
0	great feedback games keys are so easy to buy over all love this site !
0	excellent service / price / delivery - minor_problem with one pair immediately resolved by supplying full replacement pair
0	ordered a cd_key on 00th_november .
0	got email instructions with how to download game .
0	clicked link in email but no download , just a thank_you text file with note saying game file will be emailed up to 00_hours .
0	thursday arrives and still nothing so emailed kumbaso support to ask them if i don_'_t receive cd_key by end of the day then i will ask for refund .
0	0 days_later so i ask for refund within 0 working_days .
0	if i don_'_t hear_anything i will get my refund via visa .
0	update_: after a week of nothing i have received the code .
0	good website design .
0	quick delivery .
0	well priced .
0	highly_recommended .
0	cheap prices .
0	fast delivery .
0	what more could you ask for .
0	was a bit_sceptical at first due to gimmicky name but was no need , communication from placement of order was great .
0	good price .
0	very professional .
0	worked to meet tight_deadline .
0	beautiful ring .
0	thanks
0	0 . washing_machine door_seal broke and flooded kitchen ... panic
0	0 . watched video_tutorial of how to fix it on espares site
0	0 . ordered door_seal : opted for bosch part (£_00 ) rather_than 0rd_party (£_00 ) due to few mixed_reviews of cheapo ones .
0	0 .
0	delivered next_day .
0	watched tutorial online a few_times while fitting , to get step by step_guide .
0	fitted and back together in an_hour .
0	brilliant .
0	great prices , great customer service , speedy delivery !
0	the price match option is another great feature s . w .
0	implements to excel above its competition .
0	a sales_rep from first_utility came to my house he was really polite not pushy and told me about their company and smart_meters and decided to go_ahead with it .
0	this was the best thing iv done in a long time !
0	i can moniter how much im using which is great , all i have to do is give a meter_reading each_month for 000_% accurate bills .
0	the billing system aswell is great , so easy to understand .
0	all the people putting bad_reviews , clearly dont understand how to read a meter when asked to and in general just stupid .
0	i honestly dont see why everyone isnt with first_utility , best company on the market at the moment !!

0	there is nothing i could fault about my recent_purchase of two mapominoes games from taunton_leisure .
0	i chose them as they offered the cheapest price on the internet for the products .
0	the delivery came earlier_than_expected and the items were completely_undamaged and in great condition .
0	taunton_leisure also re - used a box from a previous delivery ( it said in big letters on the side beans and sausages ), which showed a prudent approach to business and the environment .
0	first_class !
0	i had a package arranged for this morning between 0 and 00 .
0	i had the day off of work so waited in my front room for the hour , knowing that i would see the van turn_up .
0	it never arrived .
0	instead , i received an insulting text_message hours_later informing_me that the delivery had been rejected by the recipient .
0	i phoned asos immediately to confirm the delivery address was correct , to which they confirmed correctly , and then passed me on to this abhorrent company .
0	i spent 00_minutes speaking to automated messages before trying my luck with a different team that i found on the website .
0	the woman , mandy , seemed not to care and passed me through to the ' customer_care ' team .
0	care - ha !
0	i was on hold for 00_minutes before giving up .
0	i then found this website with many a 0_star_review on it .
0	i saw that an email address was recommended by members of the company on here - i thought great , that should provide some answers .
0	hours_later and the apparently ' always manned ' email address has sent no reply , despite me sending my consignment_number and contact telephone_number .
0	i needed this parcel as i '_m going on holiday tomorrow morning .
0	useless bunch of cowboys , avoid at all costs .
0	and don_'_t you dare respond to this saying ' send us an email ' - i know for a fact you won_'_t reply .
0	the most unprofessional company it '_s ever been my displeasure to deal with .
0	i needed a collection rebooked .
0	the agent i spoke to , sammie_taylor , was very friendly and helpful and sorted my issue out within_seconds .
0	wonderful service .
0	will_definitely be using again .
0	thanks sammie !
0	i ordered a three stone engagement_ring from diamonds_factory with some reservation as you are not able to actually see the product until it reaches your door .
0	all those reservations were completely unnecessary though .
0	rianne dealt_with my order from_start until finish and was so helpful and friendly to talk to ( even recommended to order a couple of sizes up to ensure it fitted when i popped ' the question ').
0	the ring arrived and fitted when i presented it , however i was very slightly_disappointed with the brilliance and shine of the diamonds .
0	i spoke to rianne about this , and she was very understanding and made it easy for me to adjust my order and to adjust the cut grade , also she recommended which certificate i should get .
0	this was all at a very small price increase , but the finished ring now on my fiancées finger is incredible and dazzling and worth so much more than any small increase in price .
0	can not recommend enough .
0	amazing job rianne and team .
0	thank_you for making my purchase so easy and special
0	scott .
0	i booked the wrong tickets due to the website displaying incorrect booking summary details before i purchased !
0	when checking my tickets after i had paid for them , the booking summary stated it was same day return .
0	the initial booking summary before i paid for them did not say this .
0	called the contact center to explain the situation , long_story_short , treated with contempt from astonishingly rude manager and told a refund would still cost £_00 , despite my wrong booking being their fault due to errors on the website .
0	yet another company contributing to rip_off britain !
0	the manager , sean , should be_ashamed of him self .
0	in the end i was able to use virgin_trains website , who also do not charge booking_fees and display booking summary information accurately before you pay .
0	i have emailed redspottedhanky a complaint so i will update in due course .
0	when leaving t - mobile i was told i didn_'_t need to give notice to leave .
0	they then charged me a early_termination fee .
0	this was before i had even left t - mobile !
0	i only spoke to some one trying to retain me and told them i wanted to leave !
0	i '_m now with tesco who have much_cheaper packages and only english call_centres .
0	t - mobile is now known as ee so avoid them and get a better deal with tesco , talk_talk or 0 .
0	very competitive_prices , fast dispatch and product as expected .
0	very happy so_far .
0	i would certainly order from again with very good prices and free delivery
0	i ' d recommend riverside_garden_centre without a doubt ; they are very competitively_priced , delivery was punctual and well communicated and the bbq is great .
0	excellent service on sending out samples .
0	fast and well communicated .
0	will see next what they are like for larger orders of tiles .
0	amazing site !
0	ordered my usual protein , free next_day delivery , and a free_gift all for the same price as going to the supplier !
0	!
0	do not pass this site up !!
0	will be using all the time from now on !
0	!
0	absolute quality , start to finish , everything_went as it should !
0	mike and irina were brilliant , looked after us and made sure everyone had a top time , even the - 00 temperatures weren_'_t a problem !
0	epic weekend made much_better by knowing the tour company had sorted everything for us !
0	!
0	can '_t speak highly_enough about them !
0	i always use these_guys , and very rarely have any_issues .
0	had to rebook a delivery for tomorrow , got " live_chat help " from gemma , very courteous , helpful , and efficient .
0	thank_you
0	i love this website .
0	this is the only place i purchase i workout needs from .
0	i love all the discounts .
0	i am leaving o0 today .
0	the service was , at one point , quite good , but has degraded to the point of being useless .
0	i have had to endure awful reception , constant texts about other deals and plans ( as if they weren_'_t already leaching enough money from me ) dropped calls , unsent texts , calls being ended abruptly ( often when i '_m in the middle of a sentence ) and , disturbingly often , the complete inability to even make a phone_call in the first place , which , as i am sure you can all agree , rather_defeats the purpose of being a network ; if you can '_t be absolutely certain that your customers will be able to call people on their phones what on earth is the point of trying to provide a service ?
0	i am now in the process of changing my network to a company who is serious and is not larking about , playing_games and pretending to be a business .
0	i have had no help and no explanations .
0	my emails have gone_unanswered .
0	i could have had a doctor '_s appointment this morning .
0	i have a host of illnesses i need to sort but because o0 decided to be lazy and useless i now have to wait_until tomorrow .
0	great .
0	i rang and rang and i missed the window because my phone outright refused to connect the call .
0	i am extremely angry .
0	i am utterly convinced that every_single five - star_review of o0 i read on this site has_been written with the promise of money involved ; i refuse to believe that they are legitimate , and if any of you o0 lackeys are reading this and you ' d like to debate what i '_m saying , go_ahead .
0	please , i would love to hear you try to defend yourselves .
0	i could do with a laugh today .
0	and if you decide that , after_reading this , you no_longer want me as a customer well ...
0	i don_'_t honestly care .
0	i blew ten_pounds on a service that i can '_t even use .
0	oh , and i warn you now that any reply , any kind of response from you will be made public .
0	i will post it to every_single review site i can find .
0	trustpilot , yelp , i '_ll post to facebook , i will make everybody i know aware of it .
0	i promise .
0	it was the first time i used this website but it was very easy to use and i received really good quote and great service . i would certainly recommend this website to everyone as it saves loads of time and money .
0	thank_you and keep the good job !!!
0	!
0	best regards
0	v . georgiev
0	i have used dfds so many_times and every time they have been perfect . on number of occasions i have had to contact the customer service and have always received the help i needed as quickly as i needed it .
0	i am travelling at_least 00 times a year abroad and would never book my ferry with anyone_else .
0	thank_you dfds for always been so great and kind to us !!

0	what a simple website .
0	i ’ ve done my research and after checking out 00 different recycling_websites i have to say this is definitely the simplest .
0	search your phone , place the order and wait for your money .
0	couldn ’_t be easier .
0	the communication is really good .
0	i received an email all the way through the order .
0	when they received the phone , when it was tested and when i would be paid .
0	i would definitely recommend it .
0	try it out for yourselves .
0	you won_’_t be disappointed .
0	i wasn_'_t .
0	i decided to buy parallels for mac , £_00 on their website but i was lucky that an unusual earlier payment stopped this going through which led to me finding it on amazon for £_00 .
0	me ... happy !
0	:) it also arrived before an order placed with another uk company a few_days before the order with amazon !
0	iceland is also great for single people and for those who can '_t cook !
0	i '_ve found lots of great offers on meals for one , especially the pizzas and ice_creams .
0	on my latest visit , there was none of the lettuce i wanted but a member of staff went and got some which had just arrived at the warehouse out the back .
0	very helpful .
0	i regularly use the trainline for buying tickets to get to london and it always finds the cheapest ticket from across all the train companies .
0	it is all very convenient and works well .
0	the only_downside is the booking_fee , but that is the price of convenience and if i '_m buying a lot of tickets at once then it is well_worth it .
0	it '_s been about three_weeks since i received my earphones and all has worked fantastic .
0	i have other headphones bookmarked as i wish to purchase them when i have the money - good one not the cheap kind this time and i am going to buy them from iheadphones when i can .
0	we were so badly_let_down by this company that it almost cost us our own business .
0	we gave them deadlines and explained that if they could not meet them to just tell us as we had another supplier who could meet them , but we were assured there wouldn_'_t be a problem .
0	the samples we asked for by a set deadline were missed but we were again reassured the order in full would be ready for a press conference to be screened on live tv .
0	only days sbefore the press conference they started the kit but still assured us it would be ready , they told us to come at closing time on the friday to collect it .
0	as it was toning we wrongly took their word that all kit was in boxes , it wasn_'_t , we were lied to as they knew there were still items incomplete but put that all items were in boxes anyway .
0	when we discovered the following_morning that half the kit was missing an we rang them we were pretty_much just told that it wasn_'_t their problem and that we set unrealistic deadlines .
0	they are now accusing me of lying and collecting all the kit as their receipt says so yet i have emails going beyond collection date and answer phone messages explaining the rest of the kit is ready 0 days after the deadline .
0	i have decided to take this to bbc_watchdog now something i had no_intention of doing until i was accused of lying .
0	i see that this is not a one off either .
0	very very dissapointed
0	cheep , top up 00 , get £_00 credit
0	arrived very fast , very impressed with the product a ** company
0	from 000000000
0	so i love the deals they are the cheapest on the net .
0	the problem is the shipping can be outrageous .
0	i just bought a couple of items less_than a pound ; then i tried to add several free items an a tshirt .
0	this took my shipping from 0 . 00 usps to 00 dollars ups or fedex .
0	i took all the items off .
0	then it went back down to 0 . 00 i tied to add just the tshirt an it went back to 00 dollars .
0	my issue is it should have been just flat_rate !
0	they supply everything i need for my craft robo , the website is easy to navigate , and the price is good .
0	no_complaints .
0	and because they are reliable i have become a repeat_customer .
0	got a price and got a check for the amount agreed on the site .
0	used them before a few_years_ago , trustworthy and reliable site .
0	they weren_'_t the highest offer compared to others , but having read some bad_reviews of other_sites , and seen a whole range of companies i ' d never even heard of i stuck with mazuma .
0	my phone was in perfect working order but looked very tired for 0 years use .
0	i don_'_t think others would have given me the price they originally_quoted .
0	will be using again in the future .
0	easy to navigate website , straight_forward and hassle_free service .
0	would use again .
0	thanks
0	was directed to the wiskey exchange by my brother , have ended_up spending_ages browsing .
0	was a really easy site to navigate , the feedback and info was hugely helpful and purching was a breeze .
0	they shipped it out quickly and arrived in plenty of time .
0	i shall be back on there soon to find some more gems .
0	brilliant company to deal with , easy transaction , straight_forward website easy to understand .
0	price was fantastic unbeatable for the tyres i ordered in that size .
0	and very quick service .
0	would deal with again quite happily .
0	the customer service team is awesome , and have helped out in whatever possible way they can ( like extending my hosting renew date when my wallet was stolen so i didn_'_t have to worry_about it expiring until i got my new cards ).
0	also the actual services are very easy to use , really good price and i recommend to everyone for domains and hosting .
0	efficient , reliable and excellent value for money .
0	will_definitely use again and have already_recommended to others
0	i ordered the ceiling_tiles and grid over the phone , came on the day promised .
0	all the parts where in perfect_condition , i installed it myself and was very pleased with the results .
0	ordered the game 0pm on the day before it was officially_released .
0	it dropped on my doorstep the next_day !
0	i was a little_hesitant at using a foreign site but the service was second to none .
0	i received email_notifications every_step of the way and recieved my canon_0d in very little time .
0	as soon as my camera was dispatched i recieved a link and was able to track my package from_hong_kong through to germany and then into the uk .
0	i wouldnt_hesitate to use this service again especialy when uk prices are so high
0	i have purchased from here before normally o . k , but the last pair were so shoddy it was like they were made by a child in primary_school , they did not fit as the arms were at different_angles and the actual frame work around the lens was twisted .
0	well i suppose it '_s workmanship for the money .
0	there is no ability to talk with customer service over the phone so i will take my loss and go somewhere_else , 0 positive is that it was delivered quickly .
0	i have been using overclockers for the better part of 0 years_now .
0	i am still a loyal_customer to them and i can_vouch for their high_quality service .
0	their shipping speed is very quick also .
0	i know those who have had rma have received extremely good support service although i can happily say i '_ve never had an rma with overclockers !
0	:)
0	i purchased t0de last night after using their trial .
0	at first i was very skeptical due to them not accepting_paypal .
0	although after_speaking with support he explained why which made a lot of sense as people had been doing a lot of charge backs against the account to scam him .
0	not only did the paypal make it seem skeptical but the site didn_'_t seem to have been updated in a fairly long time , although this was also explained and support seems to be online quite often !
0	alas i decided to go through the bitcoin process , at first it was confusing but they happily talked_me through it .
0	in the end i have received a high_quality product that i am very happy with .
0	i have also had an issue which was down to my own fault although they helped_me out with that also extremely quickly .
0	i am happy to help anybody with this and i can_vouch for these a thousand times over .
0	all in all i couldn_'_t have been happier with my purchase .
0	absolutely perfect service !
0	i cannot_fault it .
0	autokey_system gives you your key_instantly with a photo image of the retail key ( excellent when you need to recover a stolen account ).
0	it also links them to your own account so you can have a database of all the games you have purchased with them .
0	to get your key you must verify your phone number ( which cannot be voip ).
0	this is to verify ownership and also prevents any of those who try to scam .
0	the code worked_perfectly on origin ( ea ) and i had no_problems what so ever .
0	the key was very cheap in comparison to the origin store ( over 00_%_cheaper !).
0	i will be using this site as much as possible , i just cannot_fault them anywhere and they will be recommended to many if not all of my friends !
0	another amazing purchase from cjskeys .
0	farcry 0 is cheaper_than anywhere ( deluxe_edition costing_£ 0 less_than a normal version , so grabbed that up .)
0	bought 0 - 0 games / dlc codes from cjs now , and i '_ve only had one of them with a problem .
0	which was sorted by their fast replying , friendly staff in no time .
0	will_continue to use for most , if not all , of my pc purchases .
0	really couldn_'_t be_happier .
0	thanks guys / gals .
0	: d
0	i '_ve pre_- ordered a lot of games from shopto , at_least 00 , and they '_ve always been here before release_date .
0	also ordering games that are already out , get to you in no time .
0	i '_ve had problems with other online companies taking up to a week for stuff to get to me and it '_s rediculous , considering the servive i '_ve had from shopto .
0	as you might have guessed , i only stick with them now .
0	:]
0	this is my on stop_shop for all my supplements .
0	fast shipping and good prices .. i think that says it all ..
0	hostelbookers is the website for people who want cheap and good places to be in the whole world .
0	it provides means to assure if you doing the right choice , and connects you with hostels and hotels that otherwise you would never know .
0	so , hostelbookers is the perfect website for real travelers .
0	i '_ve been ordering from supplementwarehouse for over 0 + years_now and i just keep_coming_back .
0	everyone tells_me to go to bodybuilding . com and whatever , but i just keep_coming_back .
0	i always counter with " you should go to supplementwarehouse . com !"
0	the price beating option is awesome .
0	shipping is usually pretty good too ... and you get free_shaker_bottles all the time !
0	can '_t beat that !
0	shipping is fast as hell and usually comes within just a couple days at most .
0	i '_ll stick with them as long as they are around !
0	- mike blanton
0	i have never had any_problems dealing_with the hut .
0	on occasion i can find deals there that beat the prices of both play . com and amazon . co . uk , but those deals are quite few and far between and usually only appear when they have their sales .
0	they often inundate me with emails_informing_me about new sales they have running , and if i didn_'_t know better i ' d say that they were always running a sale of some kind .
0	overall , i ' d say that the hut is acceptable , but it is rarely my first choice when it comes to buying books , dvds , or games .
0	i have dealt_with amazon for a number of years and i have never had a problem with them ( touch - wood ).
0	especially now that they have free delivery with all of their items , i really cannot_fault them .
0	the only niggling detail is that it '_s not always easy to tell which items are being sold by amazon themselves and which are being sold ' through ' amazon by other_companies - to which the super - saver - delivery offer doesn_'_t apply .
0	the company did not leave the vip night club tickets at the hotel reception so we had to pay entry ourselves and have not received a refund .
0	go_karting was great fun and the hotel was in an excellent location .
0	strip club was cheap and grotty .
0	i '_m a paranoid person and this page gave_me enough confidence to do my booking !
0	it '_s really easy to use and i have confirmed several_times that provides the best prices !
0	great alternative for everyone that is searching for cheap and good alternatives .
0	they will always match a price and the customer service is amazing .
0	thumbs_up for the military discount !
0	order process was simple , price was good and delivery was fast & without_any_issues .
0	i ' d have no_hesitation recommending chemicaluk . com to anybody and i '_ll be using them again .
0	i bought a kettle from go - electrical nearly 0 years_ago and unfortunately it developed a minor fault with the lid .
0	after_speaking with the manufacturer i was told i needed my proof of purchase which i couldn_'_t find as the serial_number alone wasn_'_t enough .
0	normally this wouldn_'_t have been a problem but , firstly , i couldn_'_t remember where i bought the kettle from and secondly , my hard_drive failed before_christmas and i lost over 00 years of e_- mails .
0	after_speaking to my bank they were able to track down a purchase around the time i thought i bought it .
0	i phoned go - electrical and the lady on the phone was extremely_helpful and tried numerous ways to find my details .
0	after a few minutes she was able to and promptly e_- mailed me a copy of the invoice within 0 minutes .
0	because of this i was able to return the kettle and get a replacement .
0	go - electrical '_s excellent service not only got me the best price in the first place , but also saved me spending another £_00 on a new kettle .
0	very impressed .
0	i '_ve just placed another order .
0	couldn_'_t find the salomon s - lab advances - skin 00 in hong_kong , found it on trekkinn and it '_s cheaper_than hk retail price even shipping cost included !
0	!
0	the website had a good layout , was easy to use and the items arrived quickly and exactly as_described .
0	as mentioned_above , these_guys are not playing around and sitting on orders , you pay they provide whatever you payed for , however they advise you that orders can take up to 00_hours ...... never gonna happen !
0	maximum time i was waiting was 0 hours and it was 0 years_ago .
0	best site to buy games .
0	after a few minor hicups when i started my contract everything was sorted quickly and never had any_problems since .
0	realy glad i changed to them from o0 .
0	ordered th eitem on friday_evening and recived it tuesday .
0	great service and good costomer service .
0	order no :_000000000
0	i have been using maximuscle for a while now , it '_s a good product but will be looking elsewhere for a similar product at a better price .
0	maximuscle please lower prices in order to keep my custom .
0	placed order on the tuesday and had received payment by the friday .
0	great service !
0	i ordered from uk on tuesday_morning , the item arrived by friday_lunchtime .
0	all items present and working well .
0	no_problems with customs etc .
0	great value for the item - sony nex0r .
0	i '_ve only used it a couple of times but so_far it '_s been outstanding .
0	the sensor picks_up everything , as good as a human eye .
0	used in difficult light ( cloudy day , occasional sunshine ) but all colours and depth captured well .
0	the 00 - 00 zoom_lens makes it very portable ( not quite pocket size but light and easy ), the simple manual controls for iso , aperture and shutter speed make composition easy .
0	i look_forward to much more use with it .
0	our business has expanded massively since we started_using visualsoft in 0000 , with a new and improved re developed site .
0	they provide outstanding support and excellent customer service .
0	visualsoft have helped_us to grow our business and they continue to do so with new ideas and concepts .
0	we would highly_recommend visualsoft to anyone looking to develop online retail .
0	fantastic service and everything is packed perfectly .
0	we re - use the packing boxes for our rats :) highly_recommend .
0	had problems with orders missing items , had extremely rude and abusive emails ( just because i asked for orders to be changed and i returned one item ), poor packing that leads to damaged items .
0	given them enough chances to make_amends and they have proven that they are not a reliable or professional business .
0	buy your cards from [_external_reference_], they have a fantastic customer service , and deal with questions etc , in a friendly_manner and they send items out in boxes with fantastic packing .
0	if you have any sense at all , avoid chaos_cards .
0	in response to the reply_below :
0	only wanted to remove a couple items from my last order , not your exaggeration of every order .
0	apparently , according to the owner , it takes too much time and money to change an order , so it was either keep it or get banned again .
0	i refused the delivery of only one order ( an innistrad booster box , which i now regret ) and you took the postage_costs from my refund , so you didn_'_t pay royal_mail .
0	one order was lost in the post ( i never received it ) i told chaos_cards and under their idiotic rules i was banned .
0	why should i be banned for something out of my control ?!
0	( rhetorical question ).
0	you have proved yourself a liar and a complete fool .
0	i have not lied once and have facts and proof to back up what i say .
0	i must have spent over £ 0000 on your website and i '_m treated in a disgraceful manner .
0	you should be_ashamed .
0	also what you said to the other person_who gave you 0_star " we are in the enviable position of not having to chose to deal with every customer who comes to our site ."
0	that just shows that you ' re arrogant and self righteous .
0	however , i forgive you and will not be replying to anything_else you say as i do not wish to lower myself to your standards .
0	i hope people can see you for who you really are , but i hope more so that you see the error of your ways and change and have a good life .
0	i also apologise for some of the things i said in the email , i was angered by the unfriendly and condescending email you sent me ( with the same tone as others you have sent before ) and i felt it was the last_straw .
0	enough said , i wish you well and kind_regards .
0	i am testing it and not get the result until now
0	from this site i ´ ve gotten 0 games within 0000 .
0	darksouls , avp , skyrim and dragonborn dlc .
0	all cheap and instant delivery .
0	except for dragon born who had to be activated through a russian vpn .
0	this was a fast affair and they had some very easy to use guides on how to do it .
0	and this requirement was advertised well before you bought anything .
0	+ good prices
0	+ fast delivery
0	+ good service
0	+ up to date
0	- library could be bigger ?
0	rating 0 / 00 "
0	i am a search_engine freak , and i must have searched the entire internet for the best prices , service and security .
0	in the end , i chose hostelbookers because it actually had hotels cheaper_than some lousy hostels .
0	it made my day !!
0	just type in your check - in and check - out days and you are on your way .
0	two minutes later i had my accommodation booked , and all the info in my email acoount .
0	very recommendable !!!
0	good luck folks !
0	!
0	cool site .
0	nice concept .
0	wonderful prices for products .
0	shipping_costs are terrible .
0	i booked the flight ticket through opodo and the flight company charged me already , however opodo charged me 00 pounds in the next_day with any explanation .
0	it seems like a service charge for booking the ticket !!!
0	00 pounds service fee ???
0	just for booking ticket online ?
0	isn_'_t it ridiculous ???!!!
0	moreover , they did not noticed me about the service charge when i was about to checkout for the ticket on their website !!!!!!!
0	!
0	such a wonderful choice of food , wines and beers .
0	really impressed with the quality , price and speed of delivery .
0	i have recommended this website to all my friends .
0	i had laser_eye_surgery two years_ago and really have no_regrets whatsoever .
0	my tips would be :
0	- not to expect absolute perfection - i get some starbursts at night , but i was warned of this and in a way it '_s no worse a problem than looking at a light through dirty glasses ;
0	- have someone to take you to / from surgery and look after you for the first 00_hours so you can wallow a bit - i wouldn_'_t say it hurt a lot but it did feel like i ' d been in a scrum or had banged my head , and just felt tired ;
0	- haggle - different companies had different prices , optimax themselves had several different offers and i chose the one which made it cheapest by quite some way .
0	compared to the cost of glasses , lenses and optician appointments , it will soon pay for itself .
0	bit all in all - if you ' re on the fence about it , then i would say go for it .
0	my plumber recommended your site .
0	we were impressed with the speed of delivery and the price .
0	worktop_express were the cheapest bamboo_worktop providers i could_find after an online search .
0	it was simple to place an order by telephone and then use paypal to pay , and they were happy to arrange delivery to fit in with the work being undertaken in my kitchen .
0	thus_far , the wood appears to be of high_quality and has settled well after oiling .
0	i am happy to recommend them .
0	the cheapest shop for the item i was buying by some distance , with very prompt delivery .
0	been waiting now for weeks to unlock my iphone , tried_contacting the company because one day the website says im waiting to be unlocked and then the next_day it says that there is no record of my order , not only that the company has charged me twice and will not contact me to tell me if this issue has_been resolved , all im asking for is someone to tell me whats_going on is that to much to ask ?
0	so anyway conclusion is that i have been charged_twice for no service what so ever and on top of that no one will talk to me , i would not recommend this service to anyone , if possible use another company , maybe one with a bit more people skills
0	it has great deals and good customer service .
0	not a great website but great instore with all the best deals .
0	quick free delivery and0 the cheapest prices .
0	alt i orden - hurtigt levering
0	have been using amazon for years and to be honest it '_s almost taken over my life .
0	the most amazing range of products anywhere , great customer service , excellent prices and fast , secure delivery .
0	can '_t recommend it enough
0	website was simple to understand and easy to use .
0	we got to pick delivery day of choice , which is a very nice feature .
0	kept up to date on our order via_email and telephone , so we knew when to expect delivery .
0	delivery drivers were efficient and friendly , placed the furniture exactly where we wanted it and took away all the packaging .
0	the furniture is fantastic and service was flawless , would highly_recommend this company .
0	best prices and deal of all the websites i have found !
0	great service too !
0	i needed some new sunglasses for my holiday to malta and was looking on the internet .
0	i came_across smartbuyglasses via_google and their prices were amazing .
0	obviously with such cheap prices you want to be sure they are genuine so i did my research and it all added up and to be fair the pair i got were only £_00 more on amazon .
0	when i ordered i must_say i didnt_expect them to be shipped from_hong_kong and as i ordered on a monday_afternoon and i was going on holiday on thursday i feared the worst .
0	on tuesday_morning they left hong_kong and buy 00am on wednesday i had them at my house !
0	amazing service that simply cannot be_faulted .
0	cannot wait to use you guys again .
0	i cannot recommend them enough !
0	the product is genuine and i compared my glasses to the same ones my brother has in a different_colour ( that he paid alot more for ) and they are identical .
0	compared to a lot of payday_lenders out there , wageme . com is quick and easy .
0	i ’ ll be honest here , the interest_rates they offer aren ’_t the best in the world , and other_sites beat them by miles on that .
0	however , if you ’ re looking for a lender who ’ ll give you the money as quickly as possible , then they ’ re the best .
0	i had a quick approval , with no forms to fax , staff where very helpfull and friendly and i was able to do the whole_thing from_start to finish on my mobile_phone .
0	i highly_recommend wageme . com
0	shannon
0	i ordered
0	they sent
0	i received next_day
0	what more can you ask for :-)
0	i moved_into my new build property on the 00th_october_0000 .
0	it is now the 00nd_march_0000 & first_utility have not yet been able to provide me with any bills for my gas & electric with the exception of an initial bill which was incorrect .
0	i have rung them up & provided them with meter_readings on a reasonably regular_basis ( in_spite of having smart_meters ).
0	in december_0000 they randomly extracted over £_000 from my account without_any notice or production of a bill .
0	this was subsequently refunded to my account in january_0000 with no acknowledgement of the financial difficulties this had caused me .
0	i have requested details of my tariff and have calculated what i believe i owe them so if i can do this then why cant they ??
0	?
0	it also seems impossible for them to acknowledge any written communication & the ' contact us ' on the web_site is very hit & miss , on one occassion it took over 0 months to even get an_automated acknowledgement .
0	overall a very poor experience for a first time home owner & i definitely wouldnt recommend using first_utility .
0	i am now looking at transferring my services elsewhere .
0	ordered a big muff pi bass edition along with a new cable on tuesday_morning .
0	paid for cheapest delivery option as i was in no hurry for the items .
0	received email on tuesday_night saying that they had been dispatched that day .
0	now i was expecting my stuff to arrive thursday / friday so imagine my surprise when early this afternoon my package arrived .
0	better that i ' d thought it ' d be and hats_off to the courier company you used too .
0	would not_hesitate to recommend to friends to use you guys and will no doubt use you again .
0	you guys_rock at under 00 $ and excellent service , this is the first time i have ever given a feedback to any online service , you guys have given me an excellent experience .... thanks a ton and keep_up the good work :) \ m /
0	super_fast delivery means our printer is never out of ink !

0	fantastic long_lasting shine given in a very short time would highly_recommend to anyone with any car
0	i was interested in learning more about excel and found this course .
0	it was on offer and cost me only £_00 so i figured i had nothing to loose .
0	although the course had lots of moduels which seemed daunting at frst i realised that the method of teaching used was really simple to understand and enjoyable .
0	after completeing this course i feel i have a much_better understanding of how and why using excel is extreamly helpful to business and individuals alike .
0	very guick east touse web_site and good communication through delivery time
0	sgs service : 0 *
0	sgs price : 0 *
0	sgs packaging : 0 *
0	product quality : 0 *
0	this is not a dig at sunglassesshop , as i '_m_sure the product i bought was likely pre_- packaged and redistributed , however i had to carefully remove both lenses and remove multiple pieces of white packaging that was stuck between the frame and glass .
0	there is no way this got in there after the lenses had been fitted , as one piece was poking out on both_sides of the lense !
0	product : dirty_dog dozer sunglasses ( gunmetal / green , polarised ).
0	i have added a 0_star_rating for sgs , as the faux pas was not with them , but with the product manufacturer .
0	first time ordering from this site , great prices , easy to use and a lot of products have been reviewed by customers which makes it easier to choose what your looking for .
0	put my order in and got to choose a free_gift which is a nice_touch , package came in no time at all and there was a few free_samples thrown in too .
0	free delivery over 00 and loyalty_points system is great .
0	all in all i couldn_'_t recommend this site enough and it will be my one stop_shop for all my sup .

0	i am lucky_enough to be able to train in cyprus every easter for the ironman season .
0	sigma_sport have supplied all of my kit for years but this year they excelled_themselves .
0	my specialised seat post broke and no shop on island could supply the part .
0	wanting to stick rigidly to my training_programme i phoned sigma and asked them to get the part to cyprus asap .
0	it was ordered at 0pm and arrived the following_day at 00am .
0	i take my triathlon very seriously - so do sigma - you know they understand your needs and will advise you , with knowledge and experience .
0	i will qualify for 00 . 00 worlds this year - it '_s taken great equipment , which has all been supplied by this shop , online , in shop or on the phone from cyprus .

0	i would recommend chemist_direct to anyone .
0	the product reviews are 000_% accurate and the prices are very reasonable .
0	i will place orders again for sure from this company !
0	my technician was matt heath , he was apologetic upon_arrival for being within the allotted_time and was good company throughout the service .
0	i received excellent advice above what the service was offering and was able to have all my questions_answered .
0	for me , this is the best new service around .
0	cheap as any garage around , convenient , professional and above all else it was as easy as a few_clicks online .
0	five_star service .
0	will_definitely be using this company for a long time to come .
0	highly_recommended !
0	many_thanks , andrew .
0	two bad_experiences , latest one , order was accepted on site , got a call 00mins later and was told that the order hadn_'_t got through and it was going to take 0 - 0 days to refund it .
0	i won_'_t be using them again now .
0	i had a bunch of old_mobiles in a drawer - i mean , who doesn_'_t ?
0	- so i decided to make a few_pennies from them .
0	mazuma was almost certainly the simplest_way to go .
0	you add a list of imei_numbers ( that '_s the unique identifier for your mobile ) and then they give you a price .
0	they '_ll even have broken phones off you .
0	i asked for a free_postage pack that arrived a few_days_later .
0	( you might want to order a couple if you '_ve got a number of phones as the cardboard_container was quite tight once packed with four .)
0	if you take it to a post_office you '_ll be able to ask for " proof of postage " which covers you for £_00 free insurance .
0	( you ' d be mad not to .)
0	a few_days_later , a cheque arrives in the post .
0	done .
0	item ( black dress_shirt ) i ordered got lost in the post , which is obviously not my tuxedo '_s fault , but did mean i didn_'_t have the item for when i needed it .
0	replacement was sent and instead of courier delivery ( which would have been unnecessary ) i opted for a free bow_tie , but was a little disappointed that the free bow_tie was black when the shirt i ordered was also black .
0	good prices and one of the few places i '_ve found that sells black dress_shirts .
0	the gentleman on the phone was also very helpful , but a fair_amount of hassle all things_considered .
0	have ordered from gameseek 0 times now and they have been great each time .
0	my latest order was the ps0 and they helped with every_step from the pre_- order to even having it delivered a day early !
0	( although thats probably the royal_mail not knowing the release day was on friday , not thursday ).
0	i will order from them again and would recommend them .
0	awesome service , friendly customer_care and a great variety of products and unique flavors ( try the banana mixed with jaffa_cake !
0	).
0	i would definitely recommend this company .
0	i am_afraid i have nothing but praise for the staff at peter_tyson , in particular matthew , nigel and scott who i '_ve dealt_with via e_- mail and phone .
0	all my e_- mails were replied to within an_hour and my telephone_calls were dealt_with quickly and they were nothing but helpful .
0	this is the second time i '_ve made a purchase from the shop and needless to say it will not be the last .
0	very highly_recommended .
0	service great , have quality products , understand price of shipping due to free stuff and incredible deals .
0	always shop_here
0	posted my ipad 0 yesterday and funds recived today , cannot express how happy i am with the service not many recycle sites which use paypal so thanks again will recommend you .
0	black_circles provided a premium service at a price that was extremely competitive , the best i had found !
0	they delivered them , fit them and balanced them all for the price on the site !
0	very happy customer and have already referred them to colleagues at work .
0	overall great experience !
0	i placed two orders on the 00th of june with ccl .
0	the first order contained a copy of microsoft windows 0 and a cooler_master hyper 000 evo cpu_cooler .
0	the second order contained a corsair ax000 professional series gold 000 and another cooler_master hyper 000 evo cpu_cooler .
0	when these items were ordered i was told there were plenty in stock , however once the order was placed 0 days_later i was informed that the cpu coolers were not in stock .
0	so as i needed these parts in a timely_fashion i was forced to cancel the coolers as they would not send the rest of the order .
0	to this effect i created two tickets each quoting the order numbers and requesting the aforementioned items be cancelled .
0	the first cooler was cancelled quickly and the windows 0 copy dispatched for which i am pleased .
0	however the second cooler was not cancelled and i received a rudely written reply to my ticket implying that i do not read my e_- mails .
0	when i proved that i had asked for both to be cancelled i was just told the system had not updated which i found to be odd as i requested cancellation at the same time .
0	i will be placing the second order with amazon and have no desire to use ccl again and will strongly_recommend against anyone i know using them .
0	we recently had to make_amends to my grandad '_s house as he had a nasty fall and is not as mobile as he once was .
0	had no idea really on what we needed but after much research we were led to this site that has stuff you might need for all around the house .
0	they regularly appeared in google_searches for many products and their prices were competitive - free delivery was a bonus too as some items can be great cumbersome .
0	since inviting andrew along to our company to assist with business networking skills , public speaking etc , our team '_s confidence has increased massively , as has subsequently their individual performance .
0	my father recently had some dental implants put in place by dr stewart and his_team at the clinic .
0	the level of service , information provided and general professionalism impressed from_start to finish .
0	i wanted to buy tickets for a weekend event but just for the sunday .
0	there was no payment button for the sunday and no information on how to buy the ticket .
0	it turned_out that the payment button was on the saturday part and that the ticket was valid for sat or sun .
0	took a while to find this out .
0	as soon as i pitched the tickets they were available immediately for download which is why i '_m giving this 0_stars .
0	also the site doesn_'_t look very modern .
0	i '_ll definitely be happy to buy tickets through this site though and overall i '_m happy !
0	the whole_process is so simple and i had the money in my account within 0 days of deciding to sell my ipad !
0	absolutely_brilliant service and would recommend to anyone
0	when booking you have no idea where you will be staying ( if you book accommodation ) as you just select a category .
0	if you ask to know the name of the accommodation you ' re told that the information is only released once the full_amount has_been paid .
0	i had so many people asking me where we were staying as they wanted to know what they were paying for but couldn_'_t tell them !
0	i recently_bought the canon_g00 ...
0	i seen this for £_000 in jessops compared to £_000 on digital_rev .
0	i was a little_sceptical at first buying from the internet but i read a lot of reviews of this site and hardly found one bad one .
0	the camera arrived from china in a matter of days , was well_packed and worked a treat .
0	the camera is brilliant and i would recommend digital_rev .
0	brilliant company , fast delivery , great prices with fast & helpful comms !
0	really helped_me out of a tight spot with delivery to our company .
0	cannot recommend them enough !
0	a very easy and efficient website to use with good search and navigation .
0	lens and bridge sizes are featured which is very useful and quite often missing on other_sites .
0	fairly detailed product descriptions and relatively_low free delivery threshold .
0	so , overall i would re - visit and recommend sunglasses - shop . co . uk .
0	excellent service - very speedy delivery , and reasonably_priced products .
0	another great service from cjs_cd_keys ,
0	purchased " medal of honor ", received the key within moments sadly had a slight_hiccup with the system .
0	but luckily one of the staff sorted_out this issue and sent me on merry way .
0	i ' d suggest if you want cheap and reliable keys for your games head over to here ;)
0	honestly these_guys are speedy and helpful .
0	order was sent fast and they offer continual help on their facebook_page if you ' re having any troubles .
0	fast , efficient service and great customer help too .
0	the online_chat with an advisor is really helpful , and the forums help to relieve some of the tension waiting for it !
0	prices were great , and it '_s a solid_build , runs great .
0	would definitely use again
0	i '_ve dealt_with mpb many_times i can_honestly_say they are simply amazing .
0	quite service , payment is made quickly when selling items and when buying an item , you receive it the next_day , perfect !!!
0	they are great in honuring the warranty .
0	i had a problem with a button on a one of my two cameras i purchased from them .
0	they accepted to problem and gave_me a new camera rather then me having to wait for the repair .
0	quite_simply they are amazing .
0	i would give them 00 stars if i could
0	website easy to use and navigate .
0	reasonable postage prices for special delivery and good selection of events to pick from .
0	happy to recommend and use this service again .

0	printer basic offers fast efficient service with excellent customer serivce .
0	great quality .
0	would reccommend to anyone_wanting replacement refurb printer_cartridges .
0	was let_down by a rival company so tried these .
0	couldn_'_t have gone_smoother .
0	they even text me the minute my parcel was delivered .
0	spoke with richard_mileham who was extremely_helpful and helped be perfectly with my query .
0	delivery was fast , the price was cheap and now i smell great ;-)
0	i have been buying from tackleuk for a few_years_now , only ever had one problem and that a was a faulty product , but they quickly sorted me out !
0	fast communications , quick delivery and great prices , i would recommend them to everyone !
0	this service was awesome
0	i '_ve now used enviro waste on 0 separate_occasions for disposing of materials left over from re - building my house .
0	everything from_start to finish was first_rate .
0	they are very friendly to deal with and always go the extra_mile with their customer_care .
0	would definitely use again and again .- lewis
0	excellent idea fantastic website that saved me over £ 0000 .
0	on my original independent quote thanks shiply
0	just made the switch to bulkpowders after my 0rd delayed delivery in as many months from myprotein , all down to their warehousing and logistics .
0	account cancelled and just take my first bulkpowders order , 0 . 0kg banana whey , quite a bit sweeter than myproteins blend but still really nice , and some bcaa and cee .
0	i '_m converted , regularly spend over £_00 in an order so will get free next_day dpd and double the points you get from myprotein on purchases .
0	thats me converted !
0	i use both the iphone_app and the website .
0	i '_ve been to slovakia , hungary , berlin and poland .
0	i only use hostelbookers , as it '_s safe and secure , and so_far i have had no_problems_whatsoever .
0	price our great and it is soo easy to use ,
0	i have been on a few best_stl courses , and on the whole they are very good .
0	my last one however was the best yet , due to the quality of the trainer , as well as my own interest in the subject_matter .
0	the courses i had previously been on were for access .
0	the latest one was for excel vba , and i was 000_% happy it .
0	the pace was good , the materials were good , the teaching was great .
0	if you want to learn about vba , you can '_t go_wrong with best_stl .
0	awesome very fast and smooth payment .
0	i though might be longer then what i have expect but was very fast thank_you .
0	was having trouble booking my parcel , up popped emma and she booked the whole_thing for me .
0	great service .
0	will_definitely use again .
0	does what it says in the tin !
0	no issues .
0	customer service is rubbish when they get it wrong , keep telling you different_stories and never give you an update .
0	the synergy centre , stannington , sheffield is very happy with gotabackup protecting our members ' data .
0	this week , one machine died a death and we were able to assure all thirteen people that used the machine that their data was safe .
0	so glad we saw your advert on facebook before this happened !
0	a site whereby , even if you join , you still cannot contact anyone because the intended recipicent has to also be a member .
0	nowhere is this clearly_stated !
0	it is like having a postal service that advertises the collection and delivery of mail sent to and from your address ( as this site does when it stats that membership allows the user to ' send and receive email '), however never saying that to do this to other party has to pay a fee , or that the range is limited to a 000km radius
0	therefore , the obvious questions , as woman between 00 - 00 very rarely join such sites , in what way is the service fit for purpose ?
0	after three_days of membership , only getting views , which is caused_by others merely scrolling_through the two search features , ' who '_s online ' and ' search ', as well as seeing that you still need to buy ' coins ' to unlock other features , both meaning you never truly know who is interested , i gave up on this useless site .
0	i wrote to complain_about the misleading claims and suggest they change it as it would benefit everyone , no reply !
0	£_00 wasted !
0	what i recommend for this and other website which is set_up solely to take money , is for all members to upload a photo that you have used on other_sites , such as facebook , then it could be found on google image search should anyone be interested .
0	numerous short positive_reviews all taken within the last few_days , all by members posting their first and only review ??
0	this is the true specsavers experience :
0	00 / 00 / 00 whilst looking , the staff were helpful in selection , yet during the finalisation , no mention that i couldn_'_t return them due to disliked or refferal to a larger branch despite knowing i wasn_'_t happy with the second pair !
0	bought two_pairs - £_000
0	rimless - didn_'_t fit well , was told it was only a ' little short ' which is wasn_'_t -- exchanged for a second pair
0	timberland - settled for them -- it had two right arms , one bent to be the left one -- could not do a trade - in or exchange -- i gave it a try , but it proved to be uncomfortable -- the staff in the other croydon branch , north end , said they still won_'_t exchange -- had to do what they didn_'_t even try : manipulated them to fit better .
0	' we believe that only 000_% happy is really happy "?
0	?
0	-- just a belief , as they didn_'_t care that twice i walked out their stores stuck with glasses that i could not possibly have assessed properly in the short time with them prior to purchase ; didn_'_t truly want before and certainly didn_'_t after .
0	-- twice only recommending that i get another pair ( did the first time - £_00 . 00 )
0	updated - 00 / 0 / 00 no reply from email i sent on the same day i wrote initial review , wrote to them via fb .
0	the second rimless are of poor design , they fall off my face with any gesturing and when slightly knocked ; too loose fitting !
0	updated - 00 / 0 / 00 - from two stars to one , £_000 spend yet still no reply in regards to the complaint !
0	as with too many companies they care more about the image of good customer service rather_than the implementation of it !
0	unfortunatly my package arrived torn , with no item inside .
0	i quickly established that this was due to royal_mails ( man ) handling of the package before discovering the joys of thier utterly appalling customer service .
0	i therefore contacted hifi_headphones for advice who were quite the opposite .
0	as well as taking over responsibility for the royal_mail claim , they also offered to replace the item immediately at thier own cost .
0	communication was friendly , professional and polite .
0	i wouldn_'_t hesitate to use this company again and highly_recommend them for anyone looking to buy audio_equipment .
0	always has good deals and also is doing that spend over 00 pounds in store and get 0 pounds of your next shop
0	good for finding information whats bean on in the news or for bbc_iplayer and what else there is
0	trustpilot is brilliant for writing_reviews for websites you get points for writing the reviews and im not quite sure you can do with them yet but other than that i would recommend it to anyone
0	poundland is cheap because everything is 0 pound but the reason i only put it three star is because of the quality of the products isnt that good but they have alot of things in store and good if you just need something quickly and dont have enough money
0	it is a brilliant store has near enough every electronic or technical thing you could think of i can never get off it but the prices are a bit higher_than you would expect
0	always has excellent cheap deals on plus have a price guarantee and if you spend 00 pounds in store you get 0 pounds of your next shop
0	google is a good search_engine because you can near enough find anything you type and it used by alot of people
0	used iparcels for the first time and was very impressed with the service all_round .
0	i booked a collection late one evening that was collected the following_day and delivered the next which surprised me due to the busy time of the year .
0	i will_certainly be using this service again in the future .
0	this is the second time i have used fonebank the first time being a few_years back .
0	nothing has changed the service is still easy to use and my orders have completed with the exact_amount being paid for each phone .
0	i have read negative_reviews but in my opinion if you send you old phone in and it is exactly as it should be meeting the criteria then you will be paid the full_amount simple !
0	i look_forward to using fonebank again in the future when my next upgrade is due .
0	thankyou hifi - tower .
0	my purchase of a 000w subwoofer was reasonably_priced , with reasonable postage_costs and , when it arrived ( within the given time bracket ) it was very safely_packaged to ensure it arrived with no_complications .
0	thank_you for your hard work on my order guys , i shall buy from you again .
0	ben smith
0	not the first time buying this product , will more than likely continue to buy it each time i run out , smells great and lasts long :)
0	just to add to everyone_else '_s bad_experience and hopefully reinforce the message not to use opodo .
0	i booked internal_flights brazil with tam airlines using opodo , but had to make changes .
0	i called up and they said the terms and conditions_state it is not refundable or changeable .
0	i then booked another set of flights for the dates i need and received confirmation from them .
0	i was shocked to find out when we arrived at the airport in rio that the flight we had booked did exist and our booking never happened .
0	we missed the game in salvador because all other flights were fully booked .
0	tam were extremely_helpful and changed the original flights to the dates we needed at no charge .
0	even more reason to book directly with airlines .
0	i have learnt my lesson and will never use opodo again .
0	i '_ve wen to equipyourtrip directly in their store and the guy_who showed us the products was amazing , always willing to help and to provide good assistance with the products !
0	paid with credit_card without problems and was happy as ever !
0	was told about these_guys from a friend , and its great to find someone_who actually has what i was looking for in stock !
0	will_definitely becoming back next time i '_m stuck .
0	rescued 0 kittens from the dspca during the summer , made sure to get all my bits and bobs from here .
0	my kittens health is number 0 , so it was important for me to get good quality food and accessories .
0	great variety online and prompt next_day delivery available
0	great selection of costumes and accessories , my biggest challenge is deciding what to wear !!!
0	and my order arrived next_day !!
0	now what to pick for the next fancy_dress party coming up ?
0	had four new tyres_fitted while at work .
0	there technican was polite and well_mannered .
0	fitted without the hassle you usually get at a garage .
0	even pointed_out my brakes needed_replacing without the hard_sell you usually get .
0	well worthy of my first post on tp !
0	if only all service you receive as a customer was this good .
0	friendly , knowledgeable and quick next_day delivery .
0	not knowing anything about radio_controlled cars they gave_me great support to get me up and running .
0	recommended no_hesitation !
0	easy to book , competitve quote
0	all i can say is what an amazing company !
0	so impressed and will always use these_guys and recommend them to everyone !
0	i typed my reg , was shown the tyres for my car , picked a premium_brand ( yokohama ) that was 00_%_cheaper_than everywhere_else , ordered them , was updated every_step of the way , they were delivered the next working day and the delivery guy carried them into my garage for me to save my wife a job while i was at work ( i have a friend that fits them so didn_'_t need to have them fitted ).
0	they then emailed me to make_sure everything was done properly .
0	awesome , awesome company and site , can '_t recommend enough !
0	!
0	i ordered caffiene tablets from bulk_powders , only 0 sites sold the tablets i wanted and bulk_powders were the cheaper of the two .
0	ordered them , paid via_paypal and they were here 0 days_later !
0	the product is awesome and well_packaged exactly_what i wanted !!
0	will_definately_use again !
0	!
0	ordered reaper of souls , got reaper of souls cd_key , not a lot else i can say it was quick and easy
0	i found everythig nice and easy on this website !
0	it had the biggest selection out there and it didn_'_t frustrate me to look up the specific items i needed .
0	i also loved the fact that it had the box to check if was a p . o .
0	box or military address .
0	i was recommended black_circles for it '_s easy system of being_able to choose a tyre , pay and roll up on a selected day , i hate having to place a call so online always sits well with me , i can take my time and review whats in front of me without keeping people waiting on the other end of the phone , once i had set a date and a morning slot i was given a time shortly_after - on the day i rolled_up and they fitted the tyres , simple really , they didnt even need an order confirmation or anything since they go by the reg .
0	since it was booked in there was no waiting , no tyres needed ordering .
0	all was set and good to go , and had plenty of email_updates / reminders / communications_throughout to keep me happy .
0	parcel0go offer a good range of courier services , meaning you can chose economy or speed or something in the middle .
0	the website is easy to use to process orders .
0	their customer service is great - always prompt answers to queries and any_issues quickly solved .
0	recommended for any courier needs .
0	sam was very helpful , as always , in an issue with printing labels .
0	their facebook_page is a great way to contact them .
0	the items i ordered arrived really quickly via courier for a very reasonable p_&_p charge considering the bulky nature of the goods . i also found their prices to be very competetive .
0	never again will i buy supplements from stores like gnc where the prices are inflated beyond_belief .
0	supplement_warehouse is reliable and i '_ve been ordering from them for a little over a year now .
0	the free_gifts and samples can '_t be compared when ordering from any other website .
0	my parents are starting to get mad with the amount of free_shaker_bottles i '_m getting haha .
0	die domain wurde bestellt und gleich eingerichted .
0	über die autodns - software kann_man entweder einfach eine ip - addresse zuordnen , alternativ kann_man 00mb webspace oder gleich einen eigenen dns - server damit benutzen .
0	basically this is how all end - user buying experiences should be ' pain - free '.
0	the prices are pretty_much less_than what you ' d expect for such quality gear .
0	they are as far as i am concerned doing the pro - audio industry proud .
0	i ordered a studio monitor and items such as these are pretty fragile , so i was pretty happy to see it arrive in one piece and work just as the manufacturer intended .
0	so many options to choose from !!!
0	so many brands and low_prices !!!!
0	always has amazing samples to choose from with great deals on added_extras for less that half the cost it would be is bought seperate !!!
0	!
0	i ended_up paying the same amount as other_sites buts got twice the amount of products !
0	!
0	just got fined for parking in a perfectly legal area ..... see you court .
0	cant say enough about how good these_guys are , ive had a few bumps along the way with my websites but never has it been sitegrounds fault and they have always been quick to help and support me through a problem .
0	best customer experience i '_ve ever had in my life over a long consistent period .
0	i '_m an long time user of paypal .
0	i have a small business and have hit problem after problem after problem after problem after poor customer service ( no customer service )
0	i was a business stream customer after a couple of months fighting to get the correct bill i decided just to change supplier .
0	had to go to a lawyer for business stream to even respond ( which they did the next_day when they saw the lawyers letter ).
0	two years later and they still send me crap through my letter_box .
0	they are disgusting big business bullies .
0	they are a private company that masquerades as a public entity .
0	truly truly_awful company .
0	from the director of a small wood working business .
0	a +++ great service leave your car while you go mc ds always a bonus
0	used this site many_times , and i have no_complaints .
0	packages always arrive on time and havent ever_experienced something being out of stock .
0	would highly_recommend to others ... and have !
0	all my local club use them !
0	happy training !
0	we placed an order last_week and ordered a meal from one of the express delivery guarantee takeaways , unfortunately , the meal didn_'_t arrive within the 00_minutes guarantee but actually arrived in 00 - 00_minutes , while there was a missing item and the food and sauces were spilled throughout the bag .
0	after_speaking to someone about this via_livechat , they informed me without giving a reason that we did not qualify for the express delivery and it was only 0 minutes late , i don_'_t know how bad his maths is but i did get an inclination that he can '_t add up , as it was 00 - 00_minutes late .
0	he also tried to tell me that the missing item wasn_'_t supposed to be delivered , yet another member of staff looked at the order and confirmed we were supposed to receive the missing item as it was clear that it was part of the set menu .
0	the food was also spilled all over the bag , yet he told me that he doesn_'_t care .
0	when i did speak to another member of staff , they said the customer service rep didn_'_t follow protocol and i should escalate this to management and they would handle the situation .
0	as a result , i have now been blacklisted and the correct form of action has_been taken against me for complaining .
0	i don_'_t know about you but i find this incredibly_rude and i can '_t believe that a good customer has_been banned as a result .
0	they also told me that other people are being banned for the same reasons , so be careful when using hungry_house and if i could rate this review below 0_star , i genuinely would .
0	have ordered from coolshop a couple times , where they '_ve delivered very quickly and seemed professional throughout the whole_process .
0	i '_ve also ordered modern_warfare 0 from them , as they seem to comfortably have the cheapest price on the market , while also promising to deliver before or by the release_date .
0	better_than queueing outside shops for hours to get it by midnight for at_least a tenner more lol
0	would definitely use again ; good price and quick delivery .
0	excellent price , well_packaged and very quick delivery - use dpd which are the best courier imo .
0	would definitely use again , highly_recommended .
0	also , thanks for the gift included !
0	great service , excellent clear delivery expectations ( and fast !)
0	and non - nonsense pricing ( eg other services include the day of delivery in hire ).
0	thoroughly_recommended and will be using again without_hesitation .
0	arranged a stag_do for 0 in krakow through chilli_sauce .
0	terri was amazing all the way through , updating us along the way and making_sure we had everything done in time .
0	everything was very easy and took a lot of the hassle out of organising a stag_do .
0	got the cd_key in the matter of 00_minutes works great .
0	a great service , with not only excellent price but a quick delivery on standard packages and also the ability to add in an extended warrenty , something you cant get nowadays from many online stores .
0	if your looking for the best in djing products , from speakers to controllers or cdjs , dj_deals is the best place around .
0	no competition in the market for a company that delivers so many different products .
0	i ordered a replacement bumper .
0	it was 0nd_hand and a little scratched and dented , but fine for the price .
0	the team were very responsive and helpful and knew their stuff !
0	good selection of drinks , well priced as long as you buy a couple of items to offset one time delivery cost .
0	arrived within a week .
0	extremely well_packaged with lots of protection .
0	all in all i would highly_recommend .
0	i have bought many knives from this company , i have never been let_down .
0	their customer service is second to none .
0	i ordered a squier affinity strat as a starter guitar for my dads birthday .
0	the guitar was competitively_priced with next_day free delivery .
0	it arrived on time within a specific time_slot .
0	i visited their newcastle store to check them out in person before i ordered because i was almost dubious of their massive online catalog since i ' d never_heard of guitarguitar .
0	trustworthy and reliable .
0	i recommend guitarguitar 000_%
0	i recently received a package from them , which came in 0 days ( after picking economy shipping which said up to 0 !).
0	all the items were very well_packaged with absolutely no signs of damage .
0	one item , however , was not the product that i ordered , it was an easy mistake as they appeared to have been involved in an accidental mix_up .
0	i emailed their enquiry service with the issue .
0	i had a very quick reply_stating that they would ship the correct product asap with no charge at all !
0	and , even more amazingly , i enquired on a friday , and the item arrived on the following_monday !
0	outstanding !
0	from delivery to the quality of the product .
0	the whole_experience of purchasing was perfect .

0	saved_loads on my current policy with protected , really easy to use .
0	people need to stop using myhermes ... fact
0	numerous_times we have had parcels delivered by myherpes through people on ebay .
0	the first parcel we had delivered was left in our half full wheelie_bin , the last time ( tonight ) they delivered at 0 . 00pm !
0	their turnaround time is slower_than me walking the uk coastline and they look after the parcels as well as banger racers look after their cars .
0	for the love of god people please stop using myherpes !
0	a great selection to choose from , some quirky items i have not seen elsewhere , competitively_priced and super_fast delivery .
0	i made the order and within a few hours i recieved e_- mails_asking for a few details to enable the order to be completed , all with simple to follow_instructions to find the required info on my handset .
0	0 - 0 days was the suggested delivery time , and on the fourth day my code was delivered , once again with simple to follow_instructions and my handset was up and running once more , could not fault the service and communication .
0	was price checking some shoes i wanted , found them in the sale on here for the cheapest price around by far , not only that but i got free delivery which i find you often don_'_t get with sale items .
0	received the shoes within 00 working hours :)
0	great site with interesting features unlike any other platform , giving you the closest thing to playing live poker but in the comfort of your own home .
0	community is another aspect of the site i love , have met some great friends from playing on pkr .
0	ebay is a great place to sell your unwanted goods .
0	however the account pages where you sell , pay etc is far to complicated .
0	it takes you ages just to pay your invoice , and to make a complaint about someone not paying you again is far too complicated .
0	keep it simply people !
0	bbc is the best website on the net , up to date , very easy to use and iplayer it the best player since the walkman !
0	news is always current and biased , great website
0	all in our_household love amazon , best prices , easy to use love love love it
0	me and the boys want to tell designaventure what a fantastic stag_do we had in bristol .
0	the package was excellent for money and kath was so patient and helpful , i hope she gets a big bonus !
0	thanks once again designaventure .
0	you can find anything you need and the free_samples are awesome for checking new things out or just getting extra shakers .
0	also if you do happen to find it cheaper they will match it on the spot .
0	it '_s the best job search site out there .
0	every job ad in the uk in one place - saving you time humping around all those different job boards - plus useful alerts , stats around salaries and a cool feature called adzuna connect which allows you to see jobs that are going at companies where your friends work .
0	quick , easy , online ordering and speedy delivery .
0	i '_m a longstanding_customer of powerbulbs and the service from this company has always been outstanding .

0	everything about the service was perfect .
0	good pricing , excellent website and quick delivery .
0	everything was perfect - quick , well_packaged , no_problems at all .
0	will_definitely recommend to friends .
0	thanks
0	i would be more than happy to recommend pc_specialist , they offer very good prices for high_spec equipment .
0	the laptop i ordered is of a very high_quality and performs better_than i expected .
0	my only hesitation with using this company again would be with the build time .
0	where it was advertised that the laptop would take up to 00 working_days to build , it took mine over 00 days , however if time is not a factor i would be more than happy to recommend the company .
0	edit_: revised rating to 0_stars after excellent customer service - the hard_drive had failed shortly_after receiving the laptop and i was worried i would have to send the laptop off for a couple of weeks to be repaired - however this was not the case as pcs were more than happy to send a new hard_drive in exchange for the faulty one free of charge .
0	shopto are one of the best places to pre_- order games , especially if you want them to arrive on release day ( with free delivery ).
0	everything is dispatched first_class for free ( except for consoles which are delivered by courier for free ) and frequently arrive the next_day should you order before 0pm .
0	i cannot_fault shopto '_s service and are my preferred choice of online_retailer when buying video_games .
0	the idea is grate i managed to get the job_done but .. shiply taking £_00 before paying for a delivery service that '_s the cost of a 00kg parcel under common services ups parcel_force etc .. makes shiply only useful for large expensive delivery '_s beyond 00kg otherwise you '_ll be paying double if your items 00kg or less .
0	i used this service to shift a 000kg item so i was happy to pay for this sort : d
0	i joined this site about a week_ago and loved it from the off , it has a very wide_range off games including my favorite '_s fluffy favorite '_s and sharmen '_s dream and white wizard , it has a great bonus of 000_% so deposit £_00 and get £_00 to play , i had so much fun i would definitely recommend it :)
0	was sceptical at first as gadget_panda may not be the most well know company but the service was second to none .
0	the full_amount of £_000 was paid into my account 0 days after they received my iphone_0s 00gb .
0	would not_hesitate to use again .
0	what an amazing delivery for such an affordable price !
0	nice guy too .
0	a terrible company to choose ,
0	i paid for next_day delivery , which had my dad '_s gift for his_birthday in it .
0	it sould have arrived as stated the next_day ...
0	it came in the evening 0 days_later ..
0	when i contacted the company 0 times they didnt_bother to reply , thank_god for paypal !
0	who tried to contact them but were unable to and had got my money back !
0	the order could not have been handled better ...
0	delivered on time and at a great price .
0	i always got responses within the answer , even at weekends and they always made the effort to link up my various emails / calls , so i haven_'_t had to explain myself twice .
0	completely recommend .
0	i chose to drop the phone into the fonebank office .
0	they were very friendly and processed it the same day as promised .
0	the offer was competitive and money promptly arrived in my account a couple of days_later .
0	highly_recommended ( having used a couple of competitors :-)
0	very helpful from the second i rang them .
0	i simply described what i needed and told them i needed them as soon as possible delivery and production took under a week and the quality was excellent .
0	they even folded the menus for us !
0	all in all the price was cheap and the quality was next to perfect .
0	i used referral_code ca0000 to get 000g free with my first order ...
0	already very happy ... but wait !
0	i was even happier when it arrived and it tastes so good and mixes_well .
0	so glad i tried this company as i had been messed_around so many_times before with other_sites ( mp ).
0	i recommend this to try for everyone just spend £_00 and get 000g free with ca0000 like i did :)
0	honestly cannot_fault the ease of use to the website , speed of delivery or validity of goods .
0	top_notch , 0 * service
0	really brilliant service from ocuk , the service is fast and convenient without_any hassle , the prices can be higher_than some of the competition , but then if you spend some time on the forum you will be eligible for free next_day dpd delivery which is amazing !
0	saves a ton of money undercutting most of ocuk '_s rivals , also with the deals of the day its easy to get a good bargain !
0	also the forums are fantastic , great way to get feedback on builds and future_projects or help and advice ,
0	keep it up guys !
0	:)
0	quick to respond , quickly processed , got money quickly , well_done
0	i thought your service was very good , as my fixed ipad came back to me very fast .
0	i would highly_recommend your service to any of my friends .
0	for the service you provided i thought it was value for money and wanted to thank_you for being so professional .
0	i was a bit_worried after_reading some of the reviews here yesterday , but everything arrived well in time and i didn_'_t even pay the extra for the pre 0pm delivery - nice one !
0	i placed my order with mazuma yesterday , i choose to send my phone special delivery using the printed_label , i recieved an email this morning confirming recieipt of the phone , and that payment would be made to my bank_account today .
0	this afternoon , had the amount_quoted paid into my bank_account ,
0	outstanding service , from an excellant company .
0	this is my second time in using this company and would go no where else in the future :)
0	i joined and i bought aa insurance .
0	but it didnt shows up any money in my account .
0	its just a waste of time it seems !!
0	!
0	i think this is the best site , allways use as long as they have the place i wanna visit .
0	website is clear and easy to use , wealth of information on the faq_page about the services offered makes it easy to get what you need and know what the process is .
0	i opted for saturday delivery as i ' d left it until friday to decide i wanted to rent a lens for the weekend to test and everything processed quickly and with great communication .
0	i received an initial e_- mail to acknowledge_receipt of my order , then confirmation that the item was in stock and my order could be fulfilled within the admittedly tight time frame i ' d left myself , and again to let_me know when it had dispatched .
0	further communication ensured i didn_'_t lose track of when my rental ended and i needed to return the lens .
0	lens arrived well_packaged and cleverly boxed to make it easy to get into without_damaging the packaging and i was able to return it in the same box without needing any additional tape or packaging .
0	plenty of information about returns included with the item , even down to a shipping bag and pre_- printed_label .
0	all in all couldn_'_t ask for better service and will_certainly_consider_using again if i ever need a lens that i can '_t afford to buy for short_term use
0	ordered for 00th_birthday , despatched on time .
0	best prices i have found so_far for driving_lessons in london , good quality driving tuition provided .

0	best price on the web
0	i purchased a fog_light and a set of wiper_blades .
0	the fog_light was sent straight from the supplier as i needed it asap
0	the wiper_blade was refunded very quickly as they were a universal fit .
0	i was not charged any p_&_p for sending the wipers back
0	this site helped_me to get all the relevant_documentation sorted_out so i could get divorced pretty quickly .
0	staff were helpful and friendly
0	ordered item at 0 : 00 on friday_afternoon , was here next_day saturday_morning
0	i had very professional service and a great experience buying my game , i recommend it to everyone i know .
0	went to a stag due booked through this company and it was really activates where brill the the hotel was really nice and the club_entry finished it off well
0	i love playing the bounty hunter games as i love the challenge of playing to eliminate players while making yourself a higher target for people to eliminate i am yet to finish in the prizes so_far my highest finish is 00th but each time i play i try to set achievable targets depending on the size of tournament i will always use skypoker as my number 0 poker site as i have always had great service from all sky games
0	talktalk are worst company i have ever_encountered .
0	if you can even call them a that .. no structure .
0	the automated service is far from helpful .
0	please visit our site to perform a health check on your broadband_connection ?
0	astonishing !
0	your asking the customer to do your job for you .
0	when you finally manage to figure_out a way to manipulate the automated_system and get you talking to someone ( as if my broadband and tv connection failing didn_'_t warrent some sort of tech team assistance !)
0	its just as totally dissapointing as the obismal auto service you get for the first 00_minutes of the call .
0	the facts :-
0	i have called on 0 separate_occasions .
0	0 of which i got told promised by ' bhal ' if that '_s how you spell his_name - that i would get a call back from a manager within the next 00_hours ... that was 00_hours ago and i '_m still_waiting !
0	bit of advice - invest in some proper training for your staff !
0	i ...
0	myself ... had to talk your agent through simple first line checks after him asking me to walk back and forth to reboot my router and tv box for 00_minutes .
0	00_minutes !
0	if it doesn_'_t work the first time ... its not going to work the 0th or 0th .
0	both other times i called i got put on hold whilst an agent asked for assistance from ' another agent ' after 00_minutes with no communication i gave up all hope and hung_up .
0	look , i am not asking for the impossible .
0	simply for my tv to work - for me to get the service i have been paying for and not receiving for the past 0 months !
0	!
0	i '_m_sure offcom will be absoloutly thrilled to look into yet another one of your complaints that are going to go legal .
0	stay well clear of this company !
0	id recommend this site , cheap prices for supplements that would cost a lot more in stores like gnc .

0	easy to navigate website - pleasant ordering_process and within a few weeks my glasses had arrived .
0	really good value for money compared to the high_street .
0	my posters were delivered on time and exactly as_described .
0	i opted for the free delivery and my laptop came in the one hour_slot i given .
0	i was informed at every_step of the way where my order was and what was happening .
0	most_importantly however , the laptop is exactly as advertised and works_perfectly .
0	i couldn_'_t be_happier with it .
0	a template for all other_companies to follow .
0	i am so glad that i found riverside_garden_centre '_s website as they have great deals on weber products .
0	i bought a 00 ' one - touch grill with accessories cheaper_than the standalone price of the same product on amazon and john_lewis .
0	definitely recommended .
0	i '_m so glad that someone finally took international money transfer process to 00st_century .

0	i recently started getting gousto boxes and i am amazed_how good they are .
0	everything in the box is fresh and tastes_amazing .
0	i think the option to select your recipes every week makes a huge_difference and the recipe cards delivered within the boxes are great .
0	the fact that i can cook all these amazing meals at home makes me feel great about my cooking skills .
0	highly_recommended .
0	good service and reasonable price !
0	i can '_t be_bothered to waste further time on this company by writing a lengthy review so i will just say this : horrendous !
0	i only have good things to say about amazon .
0	i have been using them for years and have always found the pricing , delivery and customer service to be excellent .
0	they sell such a diverse_range of products .
0	i recommend that if you are buying anything at all , check amazon first , you may be surprised .
0	my experiences of play have been brilliant .
0	great prices , prompt delivery and good returns_procedure .
0	highly_recommended .
0	my last 0 laptops have both been from dell .
0	i have had absolutely no_problems with either of them .
0	i have not had to speak to their customer_services so unsure how they perform in this respect , but in terms of quality of product , i have no_complaints whatsoever .
0	approximately 0 . 0 years_ago , i place an order for about £_000 worth of goods that never arrived .
0	despite_numerous phone_calls , emails and threats of legal_action , no refund was ever given .
0	after taking_legal_advice on the situation , was advised that small_claims court was an option but it would be expensive and a waste of my time .
0	i don_'_t usually bother_writing_reviews of companies , but in this instance felt_compelled to share my experience with others .
0	i am aware that this happened some time ago , but having read some of the other reviews , it appears that this company is still at it '_s old tricks .
0	i would consider this ... you may well receive you order , but how will you feel if you don_'_t and fail to get you money back ?
0	ordered 0pm one evening , was texted to let_me know the status of the order and was able to pick it up from their depot the very next_morning .
0	excellent price , happy with product , would happily buy from them again .
0	i have used 000 - reg since about 0000 .
0	they have great prices , they remind me when sites are overdue and they have an easy to use interface , for what i need them for , which is domain_name purchase , they are awesome

0	delivery , failure to turn_up and damage to our house
0	our delivery date was arranged and we had received telephone confirmation in the morning .
0	00_minutes before the end the day we received a call saying that the furniture would not be delivered .
0	the result to me was a loss of days pay from work for no furniture with the inconvenience of having to take more annual_leave to rearrange a second delivery date .
0	0nd delivery date 0 pieces of faulty and damaged furniture arrived along with the wrong mattress delivered - a cheaper mattress than what we had paid for !
0	the milton_keynes shop said they would deliver the furniture and put it in any room we wanted but this is not the case for heavy items such as wardrobes , when they arrived with the oak_furniture they said they would have to arrange another delivery date for a 0 man team to carry the furniture .
0	the way the furniture is packaged with the base of the wardrobe together with the main part means that the delivery staff cannot lift it due to the excess weight .
0	the staff had to unpack the wardrobe and because of this removal of the packaging i had to sign a disclaimer_saying that any damage to my house would be my fault .
0	in the process we received damage to our wooden door and 0 chunks of wood were taken out of our wooden banister .
0	if oak_furniture_land had packaged the items so they could be carried i would not have had to sign a disclaimer and the damage would not have occurred because the cardboard protection .
0	0 rd delivery date to replace faulty items was arranged using another annual_leave date .
0	we received a call to say that the lorry had broken down and would not come .
0	after complaining they delivered very late in the evening and this resulted_in another day of lost wages .
0	faulty , damaged furniture , wrong products
0	0 ) wardrobe
0	the wardrobe was faulty , damaged , unfinished and showed very poor workmanship with no quality control for the following reasons ;
0	approximately a 00 cm height crack with a very wide gap , running from the base upwards .
0	another large crack 00 cm running from the base upwards .
0	magnetic strips designed to keep the door closed were unscrewed and loose
0	multiple holes on top where the carpenter had forgotten to fill the holes .
0	the worst part is the removal_men could see the cracks and faults but kept quiet and hoped i would not notice until after they had gone .
0	the second wardrobe replacement had one side of the front_door which showed panels and in particular a very dark panel , whilst the right hand door did not have the panel feature , the result is we have two odd doors which do not match .
0	0 ) mirror - large cracks in two places
0	0 ) white filler very visible at regular_intervals on oak bed_frame , a large_chunk of wood missing and a split .
0	an engineer was sent to repair several pieces of furniture , the result another day off lost pay through having to take time off work !
0	0 ) scratches on a chest of draws - repaired by an engineer .
0	0 ) the wrong mattress was delivered , customer service said the mattress was no_longer available due to a change in stock , the result is we have had to accept a replacement mattress we did not want .
0	the worst part was that they tore off the label to hope that we would not be able to recognise that it was the wrong one and a cheaper mattress than what we had paid for .
0	the furniture is of poor quality and is not due to transportation damage but workmanship .
0	poor customer service
0	we cooperated at every opportunity sending photographs and video_footage of the damage a shame customer service did not do the same .
0	people failed to call when promised - both the delivery team and the after care service .
0	on repeated occasions i have not been able to get through at all to customer service for over a week and we have received repeated lies and excuses from staff .
0	result
0	0 ) 0 days of lost pay through taking annual_leave for failed delivery , replacements and engineers .
0	expense of making no end of calls to customer service , sending photographs , videos and writing letters .
0	0 ) damage to the house
0	0 ) 0_weeks sleeping on the floor without a bed !
0	0 ) after writing to a senior_member of the management_team and explaining that we will be sharing our experiences with others by uploading videos , photographs and an account of this online , we finally got the problems resolved .
0	we were offered all of our money back by returning the furniture or offered a gesture of goodwill .
0	we went for the gesture of goodwill but this by no means covers the loss of annual_leave days , damage to the house , stress or the major inconvenience_caused_by oak_furniture_land and we still have a wardrobe without matching doors .
0	even with the gesture we spent a considerable_amount of time of chasing this up as at one stage it seemed like an invisible offer .
0	advice
0	0 ) stay_away , do not purchase anything from oakfurniture_land
0	0 ) if you do purchase don_’_t pay in full / upfront as we did .
0	put it on a credit_card as you have more rights if there are problems .
0	0 ) if you are expecting goods check the items before they get in your house and refuse delivery immediately if there are faults because it puts you into a stronger position and you are more likely to get a replacement .
0	if the furniture enters your house faulty they will send out engineers to do repairs .
0	0 ) take video_footage and photos of the damage and act promptly
0	i '_ve_used flashbay on numerous_occasions .
0	i was once tempted away by a competitor who undercut them and obviously in today '_s market , savings need to be made where they can be .
0	the saying " you get what you pay for " has never been truer and i regretted my decision when the products arrived .
0	i now will only use flashbay as they take all of the hassle away , no endless to and fro of emails trying to explain away why they can '_t meet the deadline , the stock can '_t be sourced etc_etc_etc
0	needed some new front tyres fairly quickly .
0	they had them in the local tyre place but £_00 dearer for each one .
0	got them for just under £_000 instead of £_000 for a few minutes on the computer .
0	fitted that day after phoning the tyre shop for an earlier appointment .
0	nice one .
0	same tyres , same place , cheaper price .
0	i purchased a set of gold ghds for my fiancee for xmas and they were a great price - being a bloke i left the purchase pretty late but the delivery was still very prompt and arrived well in time for xmas .
0	i cannot_fault the service , the checkout was quick and simple and i really got a bargain .
0	lots of info and i love the bbc_iplayer n links o radio0
0	the best search_engine n the internet bar_none
0	i would recommend this site to absolutely anyone .
0	i will no_longer buy from gnc , vitamin world , or any other store as long as this site is available .
0	wonderful service , super_fast shipping , and lots of great free items .
0	tightboards followed up with me asking me to rate my experience with their site .
0	so here we go .
0	i looked on every site i could for the holden jacket i wanted in my size and rare color .
0	i found only two others that had the same jacket , but i found that tightboards had the easiest checkout system , just a few pages .
0	so i went with them .
0	great experience , start to finish , would buy from this store again .
0	everything was perfect , from the hostel to the activities .
0	all planned and organised so all we had to was show up !
0	am looking into planning my own stag_do with chillisauce .
0	man this site has everything and they have tons of freebies !
0	on other_websites it seems that the stuff is always on backorder but not supplement_warehouse .
0	these_guys are the shiz !
0	great service .
0	cheap prices , fast delivery .
0	what else can be added ?
0	what '_s not to love ?
0	they sell just about everything , they ' re often cheaper_than anywhere_else , and the checkout_process couldn_'_t be easier .
0	ok , so it isn_'_t the prettiest looking site on the web and it '_s about time they made the add to basket button ajax , but with 0 - click enabled and a subscription to amazon_prime i can locate and buy most things in under a minute and it arrives the next_day .
0	i have also , in all the years i '_ve been using amazon , never had a bad_experience , even when purchasing from other merchants in the marketplace .
0	the site is very easy to navigate and select your phone .
0	the sell process is a breeze , the pack arrives the next_day and now that they offer payment by faster payment transfer the whole_process only takes a few_days .
0	great way to make some quick cash out of the smartphone graveyard that is my desk drawer !
0	we booked a hotel in benidorm and when we got there we were not booked in .
0	we had no idea what to do .
0	phoned alpha_rooms and they had moved us without telling us .
0	we were moved to a worse hotel without aircon and for the 0 nights no fresh towels or maid service .
0	we were refused this .
0	on arriving home i contacted alpha_rooms and they tried to blame a different agent .
0	alpha_rooms were our agent and said they " tried " to contact me .
0	tried isn_'_t good enough when your sending people to another country .
0	no email , no answer phone message .
0	the final email from the complaint said " i '_m sorry there is nothing we can do ".
0	at no point did they properly apologise or even admit any blame .
0	beware !!!!!!!
0	use travel_republic as they are cheaper and send you to the correct hotel
0	i have been using bulk_powders for a few_months now after coming over from a rival company .
0	deliveries have always been on time , accurate and without_any_issues .
0	free_samples are sometimes offered on their website which makes_sense as it allows me to try a product and is a potential sale for bp .
0	also their customer service is faultless .
0	i will_continue to use them for the foreseeable_future .
0	they also have frequent_offers which i '_ve taken_advantage of which helps to save a bit of money or get a product free .
0	i used to use myprotein about a year_ago but have been away and have not needed to use them until now .
0	the service was always good and i never had any_problems .
0	my first purchase this year was on saturday_afternoon .
0	it is now monday_morning and dpd have been and gone after delivering my order .
0	to be honest i '_m astonished .
0	i do a lot of online ordering and as a general rule if you order something at the weekend ( even if you need next_day delivery ) you don_'_t receive it until tuesday .
0	most companies don_'_t process orders at the weekend .
0	with this in mind i felt it was important to leave_feedback highlighting the outstanding service i received using myprotein .
0	i '_ll have no_hesitation using them again when i need to re - order in a few weeks time .
0	and as always the prices for a bulk buy of whey_protein are excellent .
0	i have order 0 jackets and after 0 days they sent me an email that they dont have the order and they are sorry ok no problem but ........ my transaction was pending so i said no warys it will come_back ........ wrong they took the money from my account and surprise i have tried to get in touch for over 0 week send email with no answer from them and then i have found the email of their ceo and told_him what is happing and surprise next_day email from them then after 0 week my money were back i will not recomend them
0	first time i '_ve_used this website .
0	very impressed and i will check them out first on future_purchases .
0	very speedy delivery with no surcharge , in fact no charge at all .
0	having done my research on a new suitcase i chose an antler and looked for a supplier .
0	luggage express provided the item at 00_%_off the list price and with free delivery .
0	i made the purchase and have been delighted by the responses and the product .
0	i have been kept up to date throughout the order and delivery process and since .
0	if all internet retailers behaved in such a proffessional way i wouldn_'_t be writing this review but credit where it '_s due , it '_s just a shame that this type of product is only purchased rarely and therefor i might not need their services again for many_years .
0	i '_ll spread the word though to anyone_thinking of upgrading their own bags .
0	no_problems , arrived quickly
0	item was as_described , delivery was exactly when expected (~ 00_minutes into 0 hour delivery window ), and price was very reasonable .
0	this is now my go to website
0	two thumbs_up
0	quick service and really good product .
0	thanks
0	for over last 0 years i have been buying tickets from 00 and i have never had a problem with them .
0	i love a fact that i can collect tickets form the office to avoid delivery payment .
0	stuff is always friendly and flexible with deals .
0	good company .
0	i would order from chemist_direct again .
0	the service was excellent
0	and i received my order the next_day .
0	excellent service .
0	the live help operator who dealt_with my query ( daniel ) was most helpful and professional .
0	many_thanks
0	having received my last consignment from bannerfield tools , the experience was hassle_free .
0	all the items ordered were in stock and arrived without_delay .
0	overall a pleasure to deal with and at a good price .
0	purchased a tablet online last night , was informed i will get a confirmation_email .
0	the confirmation_email never turned_up so i rang customer_services .
0	was told they had received the order , and the payment and asked did i want the last one ?
0	to which i replied ' well , that is why i ordered it '.
0	i was then
0	told it was on the way and i would get a confirmation_email .
0	again the email never arrived , so concerned i rang again , to be told they were out of stock and they will let_me know when they ' re back in , which could be whenever .
0	i was told i then had to ring back in the morning if i wanted a refund .
0	if only i checked here first , i wouldn_'_t have bothered ordering in the first place
0	ordered an item on the 0th of jan for my girlfriends_birthday on the 00th , i thought this would be sufficient time for an item to arrive .
0	it is now 00th of feb and i have still received nothing .
0	i had to buy a replacement present since it embarrassingly did not turn_up .
0	i have requested a refund more times than i would like to count .
0	customer_services replied initially and told me they would be back in touch once they had spoken to the courier , which they never did .
0	they are now not answering any emails ( other than automated_reply ), i put a post about poor service on their facebook_page which did get a response but they tell me they will have to transfer me as " its not their department ".
0	this situation is totally_unacceptable and if i do not get a refund soon i will look into taking some legal_action_against them , just out of principle .
0	if you want to do online course and is your first experience then you must give a chance to e_careers and you will see the result
0	i recommend you to join e_careers and have an educated life
0	ordered liquid_egg_whites , arrived quickly , product prefect .

0	kind_regards ,
0	nathan smith .
0	i don_'_t expect the best customer service from a website that '_s pushing products like these_folks do , but at times they ' re just flat out disappointing .
0	the site '_s tricky to navigate if you don_'_t know what you ' re looking for , so it '_s best to browse somewhere_else and then come here with the exact product you want in mind .
0	also , never trust their shipment process to just go through .
0	plan on babying the entire ordering_process all the way up until it ships .
0	sometimes it feels_like these_folks aren_'_t even interested in making a sale .
0	a superb seller with great customer service and quick delivery !
0	i had an question about a product so rang the customer service number and the gentleman dealt_with my query very efficiently !
0	when the product arrived , i was very happy ...... the descriptions on the website were spot on .
0	overall a great website with quality gear and very competitive_prices !
0	recommended
0	very easy and quickly .
0	best prices , and widest selections .
0	shipping is reasonable and fast .
0	lifetime customer .
0	the title_says it all really - the ordering_process was very slick , my suit was delivered quickly by courier and was packaged very well .
0	the quality of the item is excellent and it represents very good value for money .
0	i wouldn_'_t hesitate to order from my tuxedo again .
0	we needed some medication quickly and not only were medicines0pets the cheapest , they also dispatched next_day and the item arrived quickly .
0	the service was excellent and i would thoroughly_reccommend them !
0	can '_t praise the team at usbnow highly_enough .
0	my pc failed and i desperately_needed to recover the data from the hard_drive and was not sure which way to proceed .
0	they gave_me some great advice and sold me an ide / sata adapter kit that allowed_me to connect my hard_drive to another pc and recover the data i needed .
0	avnow were brilliant .
0	we needed a flat_tv bracket for our new lcd_tv and they talked us through the options , no flannel just sound_advice and it was delviered the next_day with a free hdmi_lead thrown in as well
0	excellent service from usb0u on branded_usb_memory_sticks .
0	their in - house designer turned around our concept in a coupe of hours and the custom_usb_memory_stick they delivered exceeded all expectations .
0	i am getting a new suite and my old one is going to my daughter `_s , so needed someone reliable to move it for me . got online , found any van ... so easy .., you just put what the job is .... and wait for the quotes to come in , you can see reviews about them as well .
0	the one i opted for contacted me right away , no_messing .
0	any van , super site if you are looking for a job to be done
0	delivery is really fast so one can make a last_minute order knowing they will receive on time .
0	i have been using this for just twelve_months now and have already had over £_000 payout . this goes straight into my bank_account , in amatter of 0 or 0 days . i am not a big spender but as there are so many websites available on topcashback , one finds they can use it for every site one wants to shop on ... travel , insurance ,,, you name it ... it `_s there .
0	i am very happy using tcb ...
0	i am very happy to have found this site , i was desperate as the company i had been using folded up without_any warning taking with it all my balance , which was substantial .
0	i make numerous_calls to south_africa and spain where i have family and it would cost me a small_fortune to call them as regularly as i do with my normal landline phone company .
0	as su larcombe says , the dts support_team are very efficient and respond very quickly to any quieries and problems one might have .
0	when i first looked at dts was a bit_wary as there is no telephone contact number but on emailing them was reassured that they are a bona_fide company and they have proved_themselves as such to me .
0	ok , occasionally i have been cut_off during a conversation causing one to have to redial , which i can understand would be inconvenient if it is a business call .. but this is very far and few between .
0	just a little tip , if you have a talk unlimited plan with your phone company eg ; virginmedia , make_sure you end your call before an_hour is up , say at 00_mins and redial if you wish to continue your dts call . if you don_` t virginmedia , in my case , will start charging .
0	i have never had any problem regarding my balance etc .
0	thank_you dts , without you , i would not be able to talk to my family as often as i do .
0	wonderful product , fantastic value , arrived on time . very pleased . recommend . thank_you .
0	check them out for sure !
0	some products are worth purchasing trough this website such as the specials they be having .
0	however the price of all the products are cheap but when you get to the final price which includes shipping / handling it adds up to the same / around price the you would most_likely pay at gnc .
0	playstation 0 delivered on day of release , and even given a delivery time_slot by the courier so i could arrange for someone to take delivery .
0	customer service also responded quickly by email when i had a problem with my bank blocking the payment
0	i booked a flight from christchurch ( new_zealand ) to seoul ( south_korea ), with a stop over in sydney ( australia ), for 00th_december_0000 .
0	i flew successfully from christchurch to sydney , but in sydney i was told by the airline company that my booking had been done but not confirmed by tripsta .
0	i missed the flight from sydney to south_korea and had to travel in the next_day , which means :
0	- i missed a dinner with my girlfriend '_s family
0	- i wasted one day at work , because i had to take that day off
0	- i lost money because i had already paid for the hotel in seoul
0	- i had to pay for accommodation in sydney for a night .
0	- i had to pay for two meals in australia , which are at_least twice more_expensive than the meals in korea .
0	- i wasted a precious time with my girlfriend , who i can meet no more than 00 days a year .
0	- all the plans i had for the first evening and the next_day had to be canceled .
0	not mentioning that i had requested a seat selection to tripsta '_s staff few weeks before the trip , because i could not log in into asiana '_s airlines with my reservation number , but the staff couldn_'_t help me and did not suspect something was wrong .
0	after_contacting tripsta by e_- mail a few_times , i got a couple of messages saying that " we are still_waiting for the airline '_s contact " and i even got an email with a booking change that should have been sent to another person .
0	i '_m still_waiting for an explanation and maybe for some compensation .
0	worst experience ever .
0	the search_engine is very good , there are a lot of options and i had no_problems to use it , because it is very easy .
0	brilliant service !
0	perfect_condition and very quick delivery .
0	will_definitely use again .
0	not a single_complaint about the whole ordering_process , simple to select the product you require and delivered swiftly .
0	a great service :)
0	having worked in e_- commerce businesses for the past 0 years , i have to say i was absolutely impressed by my experience on partmaster .

0	thanks !
0	i recently_moved and forgot to change the billing_address on my credit_card .
0	my order was placed on hold because i put the wrong billing_address , which is fine .
0	what was not fine was that they charged my card before putting the order on hold , and then did not inform_me that the order was on hold .
0	if it '_s on hold " for my protection " why did they charge the card ?
0	i had to contact them about 00 days after i purchased the products wondering_why they had not shipped yet before they told me .
0	i changed my billing_address to match the information i provided and informed them and my order was taken off hold .
0	they told me one of the items was out of stock and asked if i wanted them to ship the other .
0	i said yes .
0	the item never shipped .
0	they finally got the out of stock item in and claim they have finally shipped the complete order out to me but only after ignoring about three of my emails and taking several days between my last email and their response .
0	it has_been over a month since i initially placed my order and i '_m still_waiting .
0	the " track my order " page still lists my order as not having shipped and i have no tracking_number to verify that it is on its way .
0	the least they could have done would be to use next - day shipping for an order that was placed over a month_ago , but they did not .
0	i ordered from blackcircles not because they were the cheapest , as they weren_'_t but because they said they could get the tyres to me the next_day and i needed them urgently , only to get a call a few hours_later after it was too late to order elsewhere saying they couldn_'_t and stating what seemed liked a fake excuse ( courier had already left , i think they probably ran_out of stock ).
0	i asked if they could do anything on the very expensive postage which was £_00 . 00 for what was now going to be 0 day delivery , and that seemed excessive , but they refused to even even try .
0	and now looking at others feedback , it looks_like this isn_'_t the first time this has happened .
0	won_'_t be going back for more tyres , will stick to the cheaper place that advertises 0 day delivery and free_postage , as at_least you can plan things for sure then .
0	in short , delivery times bad , prices bad , postage prices bad , customer_services will just fob you off with a short default reply .
0	do not use this company if you want anything on time and and don_'_t want to be messed about .
0	after shopping with them for years and having things sent to my work all this time , i placed a order last_week , they rejected it because my address had 0 letter different ( 0a rather_than 0 , 0a is actually correct but they only accept the incorrect_address ).
0	it then it took 0 days for the refund to arrive .
0	i thought maybe it was a one off , but no , i placed another order , made sure the address was exactly the same as paypal expected , so no_problems with that this time .
0	placed the order over 0 hours before there deadline for next_day delivery as i now needed the part urgently and they still messed_up the order , gave some weak excuse that they didn_'_t get payment until the next_day , funny that paypal says the funds cleared straight_away , so now if i want it i have to wait for 0 more days !
0	should have just ordered off of ebay where the same part was £_00 cheaper anyway !
0	i have placed about 0 order in since january and i have recieved everything within 0 days of my order being placed .
0	my orders are always right .
0	i wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else for supplements .
0	they match and discount that match .
0	can '_t beat that .
0	you always get free stuff .
0	it '_s free from them but the the shipping companies , fedex or ups , have to get there cut , so don_'_t blame sw .
0	try to ship something without paying see how far it gets .
0	awesome all the way around .
0	it was very easy to book and the cheapest price for a parking stay i could fine .
0	if the service is as good as when booking , then i would deffently recommend this parking stay as i travel 0 to 0 times a year through manchester_airport .
0	i dealt_with manoj at best_stl who on listening to where i wanted to progress my professional development went away and did some_research and came back to advise me on with the best course for me .
0	it was extremely_helpful and i booked the course straight_away which was an easy and stress_free process .
0	the course was fantastic and i really enjoyed it and passing made it even more enjoyable .
0	all in all i would recommend best_stl '_s supportive and passionate service that have helped_me on my path to further my career .
0	any kind of supplement brand or type you will find on this website and always at the lowest_price .
0	tons of freebies offered with each purchase .
0	i live close enough to actually go to the store itself but i find its much_easier to just order online .
0	great site , great service .
0	will do all my future supplement shopping here
0	i shopped_around for underfloor electric heating and these came out the best value .
0	helpful on the telephone when i rang with a couple of questions .
0	placed the order on the internet and as promised the shipment arrived the nextday .
0	instructions were clear and easy to follow .
0	i was surprised at how straightforward and simple it is to fit ( and i am no electrician !).
0	we now have a nice cosy kitchen !
0	.
0	everything from depositing / withdrawing to buying / playing cards is made incredibly user_friendly on sky bingo .
0	layouts are catchy , games are plentiful and fun and the chat if you choose to use it almost makes the games secondary to the camaraderie .
0	as a social gambler ( not in it to win it , just in it for fun ) this is the best of the best .
0	plus , i trust sky implicitly as they have been my t . v supplier for many_years .
0	the benefits that members gain by signing_up to their e_- mail alerts on top of the loyalty_bonuses are astounding .
0	if you '_ve never tried online bingo look no further , you won_'_t find better .
0	if you have then jump over to sky for the same reason .
0	always helpful and a great selection of gear .
0	i very personal service .
0	i had a cold and was hoping my stuff would come quickly as there was no point in it turning_up afterwards .
0	although next time i would have the night nurse ect to hand i guess .
0	would be good if it was made clear how long delivery takes but i was very happy as it did come extremely quickly .
0	quick delivery , well_packed .
0	will use it in the future !
0	i love this place !
0	highly_recommended !
0	!
0	having bought a number of products from outdoorkit , i have been amazed by service and prices .
0	ordering a product and receiving it the next_day really is dedication to customer service .
0	extremely simple process which saw money in hand in under two_weeks !
0	very well run and great price .
0	came in with a million and 0 questions .
0	answered every_single one and sorted_out everything i needed .
0	walked_away one very very happy_chappy
0	the staff are knowledgable , friendly and resourceful .
0	can '_t recommend enough !
0	thanks guys !
0	i actively try to find better deals than this company .
0	it can '_t be done 0 / 00 times and when it is done , they beat it anyways .
0	customer service is very helpful as well .
0	i '_ve purchased about a dozen_times and will_continue to do so .
0	arrives within 00_hours almost every time .
0	having just finished with 0 close friends at our night in blues smoke house in bracknell i can_honestly_say it was an amazing night .
0	the staff are extremely warm and friendly , the atmosphere was brilliant all the tables were full of people having a really great night .
0	we opted for the share platter and one of us had a burger and we got a few sides and everything was cooked to perfection .
0	not one of us could_find any fault with any of the food that we had from the succulent ribs to the mouth watering brisket and chicken .
0	if this is an example of things to come from the team then they can all be extremely proud of themselves .
0	oh and if you manage to save room for desert they will not disappoint we had everything that was available and i can_honestly_say we have all gotten home full to bursting !
0	!
0	we look_forward to seeing you again really soon
0	yes the prices at 0game are sometimes extremely competitive however i have received none uk release games which are then not able to be traded in .
0	so if your ordering a game that you may eventually trade in then just realise that some places will not take non uk titles .
0	the game will still work on your console and have english instructions etc
0	just as my review says becareful
0	my first ever order with pc game supply and i cannot_fault them at all , from the minute i had sent my order the security check was easily handled and i had my code within 0 minutes of placing my order .
0	happy to recommend and will happily use again
0	having now made 000 + orders with shopto . net i am a proud gold member .
0	the company are based locally for me and i was glad to have found them online , there prices are always very competitive and i have never had any_problems with them .
0	they have a lot of different payment_methods including paypal and now also will show you a picture of your item when it goes for delivery .
0	the speed that they can get an item processed and dispatched is by far_greater than any other company .
0	very happily sold my phone on mazuma and the turn_around was really quick and easy .
0	once they recieved my phone the money was in my account 0 days_later .
0	used office stationery for the first time to buy ink toner for an olivetti .
0	price easily beat price i had paid before and anything_else on the net .
0	when it came to delivery , the information provided was great and turned_up literally just 0 mins after they said it was going to be delivered - which in my book is outstanding !
0	cex '_s policy is , if you have a voucher , you must print it off , and post the voucher to them at your own_risk .
0	you can '_t enter a voucher_code at the online checkout .
0	sent my voucher in ' recorded delivery '.
0	it '_s been signed for , yet i '_ve still heard_nothing .
0	should sort_out there voucher situation !
0	item ordered late saturday .
0	arrived on tuesday_morning .
0	can '_t fault it .
0	easily order a dominos on a weekly_basis .
0	cannot_fault them atall .. good food and great service .
0	good quality costumes , reasonably_priced and delivered with - in days .. have nothing neggative to say about jokers '.
0	have used the site before and will do again .
0	i had 0 parcels booked for thursday and wanted to change to wednesday so i contacted the live help and was greeted_by richard_mileham and he helped_me very quickly to change the dates of all 0 parcels he was also very helpful and very quick at the help he provided very happy customer : d
0	good websites and very cheap prices and quick delivery
0	what a load of rubish these lot are .
0	firstly to get the car sold and of the forcourt .
0	they allowed my mum to drive the car home untaxed and so uninsured what idiots .
0	then i have had the car a month and noticed the back valance loose looked underneath and the back crossmember
0	is bent and split you cant lower the spare_wheel it has_been in a smash ,
0	back valance shodily replaced to ( con ) seel this damage .
0	i called into branch where i bought it to ( con ) front them ( worksop branch ).
0	they all looked ( con ) fused and sheepish .
0	then atempted to blame me for the damage but if i needed the spare_wheel they could get the prie bar onit .
0	ha .
0	ha .
0	amazingly enough the mot_tester did not pick_up on it ( why ) they were ( con ) fident that it was not damaged when it left the forcourt .
0	i have informed the finance company .
0	consumer direct ect .
0	i will not rest until they accept_responsibility .
0	avoid these wide boys at all cost .
0	tony arrived this morning a little ahead of when he said he would and as a courtesy called me first to see if that was ok ... which it was .
0	the tyres were fitted in double time and without_fuss which is all you want really .
0	great service , nice_bloke .
0	i ' d recommend this service to anyone .
0	well_done !
0	supplementwarehouse . com has everything you need !
0	they make it really easy to find what your looking for and they make it really easy to match competing websites prices .
0	shipping is fast and you always know your getting what you want .
0	having used paypal for a number of years i have always thought the same thing .
0	the layout of their website could be much simpler , the transfer times for payments could be much_quicker ( rather_than sitting on customers money for 0 days to collect the interest on top of the extortinate percentage rate ) and the customer service much_better .
0	put simply , this business could easily double its revenue by making a few simple adjustments .
0	without them , even with the power of ebay they will be left_behind .
0	like many people i have used amazon quite often over the years and although the service is generally quite good , delivery does tend to let them down during both peak and off peak_periods .
0	i cannot_fault however the downloads , especially the ebooks .
0	fast , efficient , simple !
0	this is the fourth time i have used this company and they continue to do_business well .
0	fast , reliable and honest .
0	will_continue to use and recommend .
0	my guess is you ' re reading this with the same thought i had in my head when i considered buying cd_keys online .
0	all i can say is , it '_s worth it !
0	bought tomb_raider for £_00 and after doing the verification steps ( which is easy !)
0	i got my key and entered it into steam .
0	a few minutes later i was downloading it !
0	screw paying full price for any game anymore !
0	cjs just became my favourite site !
0	cannot_fault , though it would have been better if the bag provided had bubble_wrap inside as i had to use tissue to make_sure that the phone was not broken in transit .
0	have now used mrmemory numerous_times , and the service provided has_been second to none .
0	right parts every time , and delivered promptly .
0	very pleased with the product , great value for money and a reliable , fast delivery .
0	thank_you .
0	i ordered from freestylextreme for the first time when i saw they had the ken block clothing range and a t shirt which i couldn_'_t get anywhere_else in the uk ( sullen ).
0	once i placed the order i received an email_confirming it and another one telling_me it had been sent using dpd , the courier .
0	it came the next_day and i even had a text from them giving me a rough time it would be delivered !
0	they put lots of cool_stuff in with my order too , would recommend them to anyone :-)
0	perfection !
0	precisely what you want in an electronics retailer ; the best service at the lowest_price .
0	this is the third time i have used gameseek , and i will_continue to do so as they are almost always the cheapest , and items are delivered promptly and safely .
0	thanks again gameseek .
0	from finding their clear and simple to use website , right up to delivery , simplygames provided an excellent service .
0	this was especially amazing since they also had the lowest_price for what i was buying ; i will_definitely return for any future gaming purchases .
0	supplement_warehouse has always had low_prices and is very quick and reliable with the delivery of their products .
0	excellent value and super_fast delivery even during the xmas postage frenzy .
0	all i can say is this is a superb company to deal with .
0	i have dealt_with them for a few_years_now .
0	they continue to supply me with first_class products at very competitive_rates , often cheaper_than what you can get directly from the manufacturer .
0	i have bought mostly for business use .
0	i supply everything from laptops , pc '_s servers monitors , switches , server cabs , ups '_s etc .
0	i supply for domestic , commercial and also local government / schools .
0	all of which are always more than happy with their purchases .
0	most of the kit is 000_% brand_new so still comes packaged with the original boxes with full manufacturers_warranty .
0	for some people , refurb is absolutely fine as its much_cheaper again , still back by a limited warranty .
0	my account_manager caroline hendry gives me a first_class service often turning quotes around for me within an_hour .
0	i have had situations where i have bought kit and for whatever_reason the item was out of stock so they have given me a higher_spec more valuable item for the same cost .
0	this has happened on more than one occasion .
0	thats just one example of how good these_guys are .
0	my account_manager has an excellent understanding of my needs and also my cusotmers needs .
0	she also has excellent technical skills .
0	there is also a fantastic technical_team who can talk to you on any level should you need to run anything past them .
0	i would also like to commend the accounts_department .
0	tracy houston has also helped_me out in the past being_able to send over all my account activity so that i can keep_up to scatch with all my paperwork .
0	it all amounts to a friendly , efficient service .
0	the whole package really takes the hassle out of purchasing equipment .
0	i cannot recommend them enough .
0	you dont need to go_anywhere_else .
0	found exactly_what i was looking for .
0	fast service .
0	again !
0	i haven_'_t had any trouble_finding supplements on sw . com .
0	they seem to have everything .
0	they are great to shop around with , the only problem is shipping adds a lot to the final cost .
0	factor that in and you can find some great deals .
0	don_'_t think if a certain type of number is free like 0000 (/ 000 from mobile ) it is free on o0 .
0	because it '_s not .
0	it '_s at_least 00p / minute .
0	in the 0 years i have been with o0 there wan '_t 0 month that i paid the supposed and agreed monthly package price .
0	you are going to pay at_least £_00 / month more due to calling these numbers .
0	and you will call these numbers because it '_s raining you don_'_t have a landline and its just a short call to edf energy anyway ... bullshit .
0	and boy they know this very well .
0	this is where their business lies .
0	bastards .
0	not to mention this brand_new rip_off called " be more dog " or " refresh " where customers ( the stupid ones ) can do an early upgrade if they want to loosing their discounts that would come at the end of their contract .
0	i mean they do take out a new contract with o0 don_'_t they deserve some discount as against to those who just walked in from nowhere with no history with o0 at all ?
0	i have been with them for 0 years and i wanted to upgrade as usual 0 month early .
0	but now i can go eff my self and shove up teh 0 year up my a $$ becuase now we have this brand_new brainstorm of a 00 year_old executive from o0 called refresh and " be more dog " bullshit .
0	i cannot get any discount .
0	i will have to pay the price the person would pay who just happened to walk in possibly an illegal immigrant with no checkable personal history or credit_rating or anything people could call background .
0	he could be a serialkiller for all we know and i am listed in the same category .
0	it '_s simple .
0	get the phone you want , pay cash and get a pay as you go sim from any network it doesn_'_t matter just don_'_t get an o0 pay monthly package because you will regret it .
0	i walked in the other day and the kid (!)
0	in the branch called me " boss .
0	i will not start on what else happened that day and the next_day incase an executive would look at this review .
0	we don_'_t want halifax executives and managers to lose their jobs now do we ?
0	i am from europe and a company like this would not last for 0 months there .
0	absolutely_ridiculous people at customer " service " completely_clueless .
0	calling me " boss "??!?!?!?
0	what the hell is this a construction site ??
0	lies all around about broadband_speed , absolute nonsense on my bill , no relevance to required payment and billed quantities whatsoever !
0	all in all i am not surprised .
0	the sole_reason i am with them is that its not about the company its about the useless people they hire .
0	and thats where they are identical to other uk companies .
0	want your card terminals to be installed in a manner which breaks health and safety regulations ?
0	want to be given no support , even when the terminals are not working in the manner they were sold to you ?
0	want to be lied to just so you sign a lengthy contract ?
0	want to be spoken to in a rude and abrupt manner from so called " customer_services "?
0	want to be charged for goods you never received nor signed for to be then declined refunds ?
0	want to wait 0 months for simple complaints and queries to be replied to , to just be told your complaint has_been declined !!
0	?
0	then payment sense is the one for you .
0	my advice is pay the extra penny a transaction and use a reputable firm that deal with technical break downs within 0 hours and are polite and helpful .
0	if i could give less_than 0_star , i would have .
0	avoid this company like the plague and ensure you do full back ground checks before you sign anything .
0	would recommend no_hassle , stress_free process
0	so ...
0	i ordered my dslr on a monday_afternoon , slightly irritated that i wouldn_'_t have it by the time i went away on wednesday_afternoon ( i had the delivery address as my work so i wouldn_'_t miss the courier when away ) - but it was totally worth it for the fact that i ' d saved so much money over purchasing from a uk retailer .
0	in fact , it was cheaper to buy brand_new from digital_rev than it was to buy used on ebay / dp forums .
0	well , much to my surprise and joy the camera turned_up on the wednesday_morning and i was able to collect from work and take it away with me !
0	it was impressive watching the dhl_tracking status update from_hong_kong to germany , from germany to london and from london to the north_west in less_than a day ( it was dispatched on the tuesday ).
0	i really couldn_'_t be_happier .
0	it '_s come with the digital_rev warranty , which i ' d heard people were wary of due to shipping times etc ... my mind is now at rest on that front .
0	the product was extremely well_packaged and is exactly_what you ' d get if purchasing from your local curry '_s - all usual accessories , english paperwork etc .
0	stop thinking_about buying from them and just do it , it '_s a great way to keep the costs reasonable on an otherwise piss - taking hobby ( when it comes to uk pricing , the hobby itself is obviously great ).
0	hope this helps someone , mainly_because - and i don_'_t want this to come out racist in any way - i '_m obviously british .
0	i read some reviews that were either penned by someone whose first language isn_'_t english or by someone whose is but they clearly have no regard for spelling and grammar .
0	it '_s easy to dismiss those reviews as so many nefarious websites will review themselves to give false scores .
0	i '_m confident that '_s not going on here , my experience followed the same path as all the other positive_reviews i ' d heard about them and i '_m beginning to think that the negative_reviews are from people who ' re bitter about us not paying vat with dr ... seriously , what '_s with everyone blowing a gasket that i '_m buying it cheaper_than they are ??
0	they can buy it here too !
0	i don_'_t buy into this " morally grey " rubbish they preach , it '_s not illegal to import these from abroad and the items are going through customs fair and square .
0	do these same people go on holiday and not purchase anything ?
0	no memory_cards from spain ?
0	no ipod from florida mall ?
0	etc .
0	get over it .
0	enjoy your purchases , i am .
0	managed to get some great shots of my brother - in - laws gig that i didn_'_t think i ' d have the camera in time for , so we ' re all happy .
0	i '_ll give a very general review of their services .
0	i '_ll avoid going into specifics of what laptop specs i ordered .
0	ordered a laptop with relatively high_spec for light gaming , media consumption and postgrad work .
0	i needed it in time before i relocated for my studies .
0	as such , i opted for the fast track service for an extra £_00 .
0	their expected build times given on the website at the time indicated that they were very busy .
0	i accepted the cost as a fair price for the rush service that i required .
0	the fast track service stated that it would be dispatched within 0 working_days .
0	mine was dispatched on the fourth working day .
0	i was impressed , but hoped that they did not rush the testing and quality control phases ..
0	packing was very good .
0	the laptop was encased with foam pieces inside a cardboard_box designed to hold laptops .
0	the power_cables were also in the same box , within some foam .
0	this box was then within another oversized box with foam pieces to take up the empty space .
0	the laptop arrived with plastic sheets protecting the cover and screen from scratches .
0	the laptop itself was very well built .
0	i immediately inspected it for the build quality when i received it .
0	the only problem i found was with the plastic casing around the screen - it seems not to be ' meeting ' together properly by about half a millimetre in one area .
0	this was very minor as i am usually quite scrupulous .
0	one would not even notice it unless you pay very very close attention to it .
0	it does not affect the aesthetics or the performance of the laptop either .
0	thinking_about it , it might not even be a problem at all .
0	a previous_reviewer mentioned finger_marks on the inside of the battery '_s metallic - faced compartment .
0	i can corroborate his_findings as i also have some inside mine .
0	i do not personally consider this to be a problem .
0	you can probably rub it off with some alcohol .
0	the laptop runs fine .
0	very fast on startup .
0	no bloatware , quiet operation .
0	no_problems so_far .
0	very good value for money for a given spec compared to ready - made systems offered on the high_street .
0	downside is the lack of choice for higher - end laptop cases .
0	their website is very clear .
0	when selecting components the overall price adjusts accordingly so you can work out how much it costs .
0	everything that i wanted to know was on their website .
0	order was slightly_delayed for some reason .
0	phoned them up and a gentleman apologised and had it send that day .
0	arrived next_day .
0	i think they upgraded me to 00hr next_day due to the delay in processing .
0	other than that i cannot_praise their packing of the bottle enough .
0	the box is so sturdy .
0	i have a lot of foam void filler peanuts to play with now .
0	looking_forward to good transactions with them in the future .
0	a simple online ordering service culminating in a thorough and satisfying customer experience .
0	my girlfriend_loved the flowers and chocolates .
0	the item was delivered one day before arranged , and the delivery guy was really nice , he arrived when he said he would do .
0	best price on the internet .
0	would recommend .
0	their prices are almost always the lowest , huge_variety of products and the amount of free stuff they give away in incredible .
0	i get my dog_food from here as it '_s a competitive price and has free delivery when buying in bulk
0	got a good deal on iams dog_food and was delivered in a couple of days
0	great service , fast postage , quality products , thank_you
0	just one of the best company '_s out there , always fast delivery , top quality
0	will always use again
0	they always have a good selection of items and so easy to order online !
0	i had purchased my blackberry from the store , my blackberry had a manufacturing_fault so this had to be taken in for ' servicing ', they advised me that this would be back to me in 0_weeks .
0	0_weeks_later i had heard_nothing , i contacted them and the lady i spoke to was really rude and said that it '_s not their problem and it will still be a further 0_weeks , they never offered me a curtosy phone and when i had asked for my money back for a months line rental as i have not been using the blackberry package they said this was not their fault so they arent going to refund me .
0	i am not happy at all with this service and have now left phones0u !
0	so my girlfriend ordered me chocolates for today , 00 / 00 /_0000 and i found that the truffles expired on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
0	she got them custom made online on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
0	this is disgusting service , she paid her hard_earned_money only to have expired chocolates delivered .
0	they are not exactly the cheapest chocolates in the world and to be given out of date chocolates is disgusting .
0	not only is it a slap in the face to customers but it is a huge breach of food health and safety and i will be doing everything i can to get this sorted .
0	* update * it has_been sorted , they said the old box was used by_accident .
0	i guess i wrote this more out of anger as my gf was very upset .... as it was solved quickly i can change the star_rating .
0	lol
0	awfuly awful service .
0	i cannot begin to vent my anger about these_people .
0	all they do is lie and when you call back they pretend it never happened .
0	cannot_believe i wasted £_000 on these_guys .
0	i would have much rather paid £_00 for a guy in a dodgy repair shop to fix it .
0	definitely have to expose these criminals .
0	i ordered on the sunday , they sent on the monday , i recieved on the tuesday , the day the game was released .
0	very pleased .
0	also very cheap , and payment went through paypal , much_quicker_than having to enter all your card_details .
0	00 / 00 .
0	booked a parcel and i was given the collection time between 00 noon till 0 . 00 pm
0	waited all this time and no one turn_up to collect my parcel .
0	contacted to interparcel .
0	and what ?
0	shocking custemer service .
0	complete_joke
0	then i decided to stop sending_parcels with interparcel . never ever agein
0	oh by the way i am still_waiting for my refund .
0	if you want reliablelty stay_away from interparcel
0	graet custemer service , i get all i need in seconds and she made it very easy .
0	thanks to catherine .
0	will_definetly cary on working with parcel0go
0	i went with the sports_bike shop as the web_site was well_laid_out and was easy to use and i could pay with pay_pal .
0	i didn_'_t find them any cheaper for the item i was after it was the web_site that closed the deal .
0	id say the cost of shipping is still good considering im getting 00 lbs + at a time with other things .
0	i could use a discount_code once in awhile being i spend $_000 + a month or less
0	hifi_tower were helpful and professional from_start to finish .
0	pre_- sale support was great !
0	delivery was only 0 days from when i pushed the button and my new hifi system is a dream .
0	will be coming_back very soon !
0	thanks hifi - tower !
0	im aware that ' reasonable within available method ' is a bit_confusing ... what i mean by that is that a company who relies on another company to complete it '_s business , and in this case mazuma relies on royal_mail or independent couriers , can only really provide a standard of service reflective of a standard set by the postal / courier service ... and on this occasion that was very slow , so indirectly mazuma didn_'_t send me my bank_transfer for a long time , nearly 0_weeks !
0	it '_s ok to say mazuma will send a bank_transfer the day they receive the phone , but if the courier fails to deliver timely then it '_s an inconvenience .
0	and although i respect that mazuma have no control over post , at the same time , they can only , having the type of business they do that relies havily on another business , recieve , 0_stars .
0	after an easy price match and quick shipping , i just made my second purchase from supplement_warehouse .
0	do your research , and if you ' re able to find a supplement cheaper anywhere_else , they '_ll match it plus an extra 0 %.
0	i have been a vodafone customer for more than 00 years , great company !
0	i have shopped at all the major brand and have finally found one that offers great value for money all the time and most_importantly great food !
0	i have been using viziononline for more than 0 years_now , amazing guys to work with could not recommend them enough !
0	!
0	i have bought from e_- outdoor in the past as their prices have been the cheapest , and the dispatch time and service is second to none .
0	what really inspired me to write this review is the fact they were able to order a single pair of shoes just for me .
0	it was a color and a size they didn_'_t have in stock but they were able to get me a pair .
0	really impressed by their dedication to their customers and now i will not look_elsewhere for any outdoor products .
0	bought from them a few_times and will_continue to buy from them .
0	prices are the best around , product query emails are answered quickly .
0	items are dispatched quickly and the delivery takes a few_days .
0	items are well_packaged .
0	will_continue to buy from this store again and again
0	last_year i bought something from wiggle , which turned_out to be too much hassle due to the courier company they used .
0	my stuff came damaged and took a week for city_link to get their heads out and deliver .
0	i was a little_cautious_about buying from again but then i read that they had changed their delivery courier .
0	my products arrived quickly and undamaged .
0	my opinion has now changed to a positive and i will be buying from wiggle again , as their prices for some products cannot be_beaten
0	i '_ve_used sportpursuit many_times now .
0	i originally only wanted to buy some vivobarefoot shoes via this website but the other great sales drew me in to buy more .
0	never had any_problems with them , they have always been quick to reply and my deliveries have always been on time .
0	i will_continue to use this company and would recommend to all ( but be sure to read up how it works / delivery times )
0	i needed to clear away my old cd '_s and dvd '_s as i need the space so thought i ' d use music_magpie as i ' d seen the adverts and the app looked easy to use .
0	wasn_'_t too impressed when i made the order on some of the prices but the total was over £_000 so i went_ahead and used the free courier service .
0	they then took over a month to even acknowledge that they had the order even_though it was couriered in , which i find strange given the order would have been with them the same day it was sent .
0	i then got an email_saying that they were only paying me £_000 as some of the cd '_s on the order i hadn_'_t sent .
0	i emailed to tell them this was incorrect and as it was couriered in then they courier must have lost some boxes .
0	no reply from them and they sent me the cheque for the money .
0	i emailed again to complain that they ' d lost my cd '_s and what were they going to do about it .
0	0 month later i got the response " we have completed the order for the full value and you should receive an email in the next 00_hours to confirm that the cheque is due for dispatch ."
0	i took this to mean that i was getting my order value in full so waited to get the new cheque in the post .
0	0 month later , 0 further emails unresponded to and i still_haven_'_t got the other cheque .
0	think i now need to work out how to take them to trading_standards .
0	avoid this company like the plague ..... h
0	im waiting for almost 0 months and they didnt unlocked my iphone and since 00 / 00 / 00 they didnt answer my questions and so , i can '_t get my money back .
0	they not professionals .
0	i lost my money !
0	i sent this message at facebook and they simply erase it
0	good prices and products , shocking delivery service .
0	out of the last 0 orders , 0 have been delayed , one of them upto nearly 0_weeks .
0	when i initially started_using them i could order in the evening , it was marked as sent the following_morning and arrived the next_day .
0	now i kind of expect it '_ll take a while and order way before i run out .
0	i called 0 days ago , got put on hold for 00mins than gave up and emailed instead .
0	my order was apparently delivered by the infamous and notoriously crap , hermes ( google it ).
0	it was apparently delivered to a neighbour .
0	it wasn_'_t as i have cctv and nobody came to my house or entered the cul - de - sac .
0	so i emailed myprotein to ask what was going on .
0	three_days and 0 emails and still no reply !
0	just an_automated email_saying they will reply in 00_hours .
0	good products , non_existent after care and stay well clear of hermes because they will not discuss any_problems with you , they refer you back to myprotein , who dont reply !
0	!
0	ever_since my first order from shopto . net ( a long time ago ) they '_ve always have a great delivery service and also good prices on the pre_- order games they sell ...
0	the recent game fear 0 was the best ever delivery i ordered from shopto i ordered at 00 : 00 and by 00 : 00 item sent and lo and behold item arrives on my door matt at 00 :_00am next_day !
0	!
0	absolute awesome web_site would recommend to everyone ...
0	0 * from me ....
0	first time i heard of simplygames and wasnt_sure about it , researched online read a few negative_comments did not make me feel any better buying from them .
0	but i placed my order anyway because the most i am going to lose is 00 odd_pounds .
0	however !
0	i am totally stunned !
0	i placed my order at around 0ish , and i received my hitman ( xbox_000 ) next_day !
0	ok the box of the game is abit pressed , i guess they can do better in their packaging and give it abit more padding .
0	nevertheless , i am_delighted !
0	not to mention their games is one of the cheapest on the internet !
0	i would definitely shop and recommend it to friends !
0	buying our first house also meant buying our first kitchen_appliances , so i wanted the process to be smooth as possible - thankfully ao exist !
0	after doing some_research of various products and prices , ao . com came out on top every time .
0	the next_day free delivery was a huge bonus , and they deliver on bank_holiday friday / monday .
0	i picked my delivery day and on the chosen day was given a 0 hour time_slot .
0	the products turned_up in the first minute of the time_slot .
0	the delivery men were good at transporting the products into the house without_any_issues , and were very friendly .
0	overall i ' d say its the best internet shop i '_ve_used with the best customer service i '_ve ever received , with the added_bonus of having the best prices around .
0	i even had to swap the washing_machine ( due to my poor measuring skills earlier in the week ) and it was a painless process and had an_alternative washing_machine the next_day !
0	will_definitely use again and will be encouraging family to use !
0	after doing a little digging_around for some frontline for dogs , i came_across petfleas . co . uk .
0	i had not heard of them before but found some excellent reviews and also noticed they are a vmd accredited retailer , so i went_ahead and purchased the product .
0	as well as being the cheapest across all sites i checked , they also did free delivery .
0	the item arrived in 0 days , very impressed .
0	overall an easy transaction and a great service .
0	i will be returning to purchase more products in the future .
0	thank_you kindly
0	products dispatched within 00_hours ?
0	nope , ordered a pmdg product on tuesday , and now its saturday , still no game or no notification on where the game is .
0	no email_telling_me whether its been dispatched , no email giving me a refund when i asked for it , purely unacceptable and they basically lied to me !
0	i '_m going to stick with [_external_reference_], more_expensive ( like £ 0 more ) but at_least i know i will get it !
0	£_00 pounds for the game , and it '_s still not here !
0	edit_: forgive my anger , but to pay £_00 and still be waiting for 0 days after ordering , i cannot forgive gameseek for this , and i hope it comes by monday or i '_m getting a refund .
0	can '_t beat prices , and a great selection .
0	never shopping at gnc again !
0	found the car i was looking for and checked it history using 00 000 from my mobile_phone .
0	thanks
0	a fantastic business contact database much_better_than microsoft crm .
0	the invoicing software is great and really easy to use , simply the best .
0	sitefront is great for making a free website .
0	all in all the best software for business in the uk .
0	happy to give a testimonial anytime .
0	huge_amount of information .
0	iphone and web great !
0	my product did not arrive on time and they had not replied to two of my e_- mails .
0	i decided to call consortium as they had not sent an e_- mail to me confirming that delivery had taken place .
0	i rang them on monday to which they confirmed they would call me back on that day , to which they did not .
0	i called again on tuesday and was promised a call back within half an_hour .
0	they called back within half an_hour to confirm that a royal_mail delivery driver was being investigated with my product being with that driver and they could not confirm my product reached the depot .
0	the man i spoke to said that a new product would be dispatched by express delivery to me and would arrive the very next_day , which it did .
0	although my customer service experience wasn_'_t the greatest , they did their utmost to offer an explanation and to get a new product to me the very next_day hence the five_star_rating .
0	my product was delivered as_described and they delivered my product within the timeframe_specified .
0	highly_recommended and i would definitely order from them again .
0	i ordered a pair of matte_black polarised ray - ban_wayfarers and i had a slight_issue in terms of delivery .
0	i changed my day of delivery to the next_day and unfortunately , dpd , managed to send my sunglasses back to the main depot instead of the local_depot meaning i had to wait an extra day for my sunglasses .
0	red_hot sunglasses were brilliant and their customer service was second to none and made sure i received my sunglasses and gave_me an explanation as to what had happened .
0	i would highly_recommend this company as the delivery issue was no fault of their own but they still did as best as they could to offer their support and chase up the issue as quickly as possible .
0	great company , great customer service and thoroughly_recommended .
0	thanks you for the speedy delivery of my promotional pens and keyrings .
0	they are exactly as i wanted them to be .
0	i will be using promo parrot for future orders .
0	fantastic company to deal with , always looked after and nothings ever to much_trouble .
0	quick delivery on orders .
0	i ordered a christmas_gift_card on the 0th of december .
0	at the time of writing ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) i still have not received the gift_card .
0	hof offered no solutions to this on the phone or by email .
0	had to go in store and purchase another in the mean time .
0	now they tell me they can '_t give me a refund on the gift_card - even_though it '_s missing with royal_mail ( royal_mail didn_'_t get it until the 00th ).
0	if they do find it , what good is it to me now ?
0	!
0	i '_ve had sky for 0 and a half months and all of a sudden my signal went one night , sky are saying they cant come out as its a council property and there not insured ??
0	the council won_'_t come out and check there dish and there telling_me to pay for a 0rd_party engineer to come and sort this out , it '_s an_absolute_joke , the customer service is diabolical , no one wants to help you , they talk over you and just keep saying the same thing as in there reading off a script , that '_s the overseas contact centre and the uk_based ones ,
0	if i ' d had know they were this bad i would never of gone with them , i '_m not paying for something what i can '_t use so if sky can '_t stick to there side of the agreement never can i !!
0	!
0	please anyone_thinking of joining sky don_'_t as you will be disappointed , very
0	i placed an order with this joke of a company and recieved a confirmation_email through , then few_days_later they have emailed me saying there is a problem with there payment system and its not gone_through , the money has left my account and there saying they havent got the payment , i think this is a fake company and a scam , ive had to cancel my debit_card as the company has my details , please dont order so you dont have to go through the hassle ive had to go through , items are cheaper in your loocal town anyway ,
0	thanks
0	the company is an ubsulte joke , there quick to get a uk_based call_centre to try and keep you with them but soon as you have a problem your get through to someone in india who cant understand i word your saying , they sound like robots and keep repeating the same thing as if there reading off a script .
0	they talk over you and make you irate , i work in customer service myself and find it hard to understand different uk acents over the phone at times so i dont see how the orange exeutives feel that there indian_call centresare usefull , i just cant_wait to see orange go_bust in a few_years when everyone doesnt use them , ive been waiting over 0_weeks formy problem to be resolved and stil not heard_anything ,,
0	i '_ve been using quidco for 0 years and earned a lot with great offers .
0	at first it seemed just too good to be true , but we trust nectar and they pay us in points ; quidco pays with real money .
0	the retailers want your business and pay quidco for a referral ( like running an ad of the tube or any website ) which quidco pays to its members .
0	the few_times things have gone_wrong , their customer service has_been the best , better_than many uk retailers .
0	i wouldn_'_t use anyone_else !
0	five - stars all the way .
0	this public traded company called ocado must be writing its own review in my humble_opinion .
0	the pattern that has emerged is that once a bad review is left then you get a follow_up of good reviews of similar sort .
0	well here is my experience but before i start if you believe that businesses should be fair non discriminatory please boycott @ ocado in the name of what dr . luther king stood for .
0	well see why .
0	evidence collated after_contacting the complainants on other review forum suggests that majority as high as 00_% of the complainants had a minority ethnicity background .
0	so why in modern britain ?
0	what modern organisation discriminates openly ?
0	just read for yourself comments on other review sites , company has a draconian culture of ruthlessly segmenting / profiling their customers based on flawed assumptions , customers sent mould bread or best by products , orders cancelled if they presume your are of minority ethnic background ( of which their pathetic_excuse is that you want to export there already expired products ) is that how the cater for the needs of if you the supposedly top 0 %?
0	your account will be deactivated and you will be asked to submit your council tax bill ( this is invasive and a step too far ), these_guys does not respect peoples privacy , rude customer service and worst still you have 00_% chance of being violated if you are from the minority background these are facts .
0	today i vote with my feet and raise awareness so you are not humiliated as this cannot be accepted .
0	look through the statistics it is basically self_explanatory .
0	i won a competition from oks and the service was really great .
0	it was fast and clear .
0	i got my key and i '_m really happy with it .
0	not worth your time let_alone your money , unless ofcourse you really like watching really old movies that no - one has ever heard of .
0	honestly don_'_t bother , if you like watching movies from this decade or the last , get something like netflix , they actually have stuff worth watching .
0	( using instant , which is the only useful thing as you cant spontaneously watch a movie if it takes like 0 days to arrive )
0	the whole_process took 00_hours !
0	i printed_off the forms , packed the envelope with my htc_hero and sent it off .
0	money was in my account in 00_hours .
0	very impressed with the service and the price i got was competitive with other_sites .
0	there are a lot of sites out there offering maybe £ 0 more but i have heard some terrible things .
0	definitely stick to a reputable_company like mazuma .
0	can '_t recommend it highly_enough .
0	you should buy from magicmadhouse because they stock all you need for magic the gathering and they deliver and its free delivery over £_00 they also do other card games as well .
0	just come_back from a great day of quad_biking and rage_buggies organised by chill sauce .
0	the company are professional and organise wicked events at a reasonable price .
0	had a great time , thanks !!!
0	!
0	after finding some well priced priced i booked with this company handing_over just under £ 0000 for 0 tickets to thailand .
0	a week_later i get an email_saying my tickets were unable to be issued with no explanation unless i phoned back by 0 the next_day .
0	phoning around_midday they said my flights had been cancelled - still with no clear explanation .
0	i asked for a refund which over 00 days_later has still not arrived despite many correspondents .
0	no replys to emails and very unhelpful on the phone .
0	i went for the dozen luxury red_roses .
0	really impressive .
0	it was even nicer to find out afterwards that she had never been sent flowers before , so thanks serenata_flowers for helping_me to make her day :)
0	superb fast service , a huge choice of quality engagement_rings that i could not find on the high_street at a very respectable price , many_thanks .

0	i constantly wonder_how these_guys are in business at all .
0	arrogant customer service .
0	unclear terms and conditions .
0	i will throw a party when this company shuts down .
0	i had a query over delivery on a bank_holiday , and i got a response the same day from the ceo assuring my delivery terms .
0	can '_t ask for better service .
0	bought a pair of the ' mule ' slippers for my mother '_s birthday .
0	really impressed with the quality of the slippers as well as the time it took for them to be delivered ( ordered on the 00th and they arrived the very next_day !)
0	i '_ll definitely be ordering from them again in the near_future ...
0	thanks again !
0	i '_ve only been with orange for two years ( after being with o0 for 0 + years - bad service , but i '_ll leave all that for another review ).

0	their customer_services team are great , and usually respond rather quickly to my queries .
0	definitely recommend !
0	good price paid for my phone .... was paid in 0 working_days .
0	i '_ve_used this service 0 times previousd always got the same reliable service .
0	stayed for the night friendly staff and fantastic parking convenience of a large brand hotel with the staff friendliness of a family run business

0	we have saved_loads of money in the past from this site .
0	it have also given us loads of good advice when needed from their forums ..
0	we applaud oak_furniture solutions for their excellent custome rservice team .
0	we spoke to both sam and john who both were helpful and sorted our initial issues out
0	fast delivery , good product , good customer service , comes with warranty etc brilliant fantastic couldnt get a better price or service
0	turned_up when they said , phone was already to go .
0	and most_importantly they were cheaper_than going directly to ee .
0	sent the phone on the friday , had the money on the tuesday .
0	cant_fault it .
0	my first review .
0	this moment will go down in history probably .
0	emma was fab !
0	couldn_'_t help more .
0	thats_why i use parcel 0 go for my business x
0	a few_months_ago i was looking for a new place to shop from , decided on shopto . net and zavvi . com , so i tested both by placing an order , then immediately requested a refund .
0	shopto . net sent the funds back next business day , while zavvi . com did not .
0	and getting items next business day from shopto . net is great , i will have to try them with pre_- orders .
0	great company , competitive_pricing combined with flexibility and professionalism .
0	i would recommend lopa for any paris to london removal .
0	i ordered the kangertech aerotank mega and it was delivered very quickly ( including a bank_holiday ) at a brilliant price .
0	this is my 0nd purchase from here and wont be the last .

0	if your looking to sell your old_mobile these_guys are definitely one to watch .
0	best prices on the net .
0	even out did cex on my old phone .
0	not always the best but better_than most
0	i waited in all day ( 0am until 0 :_00pm and someone the rest of the night in case they decided to show up ) and no parcel , only to check the tracking at 00 :_00pm that they ' attempted delivery ' at 0 :_00pm and no - one was there so they left a card for re - delivery .
0	no attempt , no card , nothing .
0	this is not my 0st problem with this company and im hoping it will be my last as i am going to ask that anyone but yodel deliver to me from now on .
0	previous problems include : no attempt , no card , late delivery , unprofessional conduct ( delivery after 0pm in an unmarked car by the agent obviously taking his son somewhere ), etc , etc , etc .
0	do not use this company if there is another option .
0	excellent items , quick delivered without_delay , will recommended it to my friends and family !
0	thanks you so much for the items !
0	trials arrived within 00_hours , finished glasses turned_up three_days after i ' d placed the order and they look great .

0	immediate delivery and they stock absolutely everything .
0	had a pair of headphones that developed a fault - my credit_note was processed immediately and a new pair despatched the same day .
0	best customer service i '_ve experienced in years
0	i '_ve always wanted a baracuta jacket but never got round to buying one .

0	fantastic service .
0	my only_concern was the live_chat , i have tried a few_times and never anyone there , however the positive was that i emailed them and had a reply within an_hour so that made up for it .
0	thanks again !
0	was really impressed as this was the first time i '_ve ever used a service like this on the internet .

0	worst retailer i have ever come_across .
0	ordered a tv because it was cheaper_than anywhere_else .
0	big_mistake .
0	has_been 0_weeks and it still_hasn_'_t arrived .
0	i have called every week and got the same response " we will send you an email in the next few_days confirming your delivery date ".
0	even worse , they dare to charge £_00 for " delivery " and told me that if i wanted to cancel and get a refund , the delivery charge would not be refunded !
0	please everyone , save_yourself the hassle and get your tv from somewhere reputable , the tenner or so which you might save is simply not worth it .
0	we booked a bar guide with these_guys as we have heard some of the better places in budapest can be hard to track down !
0	there were 0 of us in our group and at £_00 each it was an_absolute_bargain .
0	we were originally thinking it may be a little awkward having a stranger with us but any_issues we thought of instantly disappeared as soon as we met our guide kinga , she was just great !
0	not only did she guide us seamlessly around this amazing city to the types of bars we wanted to see , the conversation was effortless and she really made our big night out in budapest great !
0	the company sent us texts to let us know what times to be ready for and everything was as smooth as you could wish for !
0	although we only saw a small part of their repertoire , i am sure their other services will be just as good .
0	thanks guys and thanks again to kinga ; we hope to keep in touch !
0	my advice : don_'_t think_twice , book these_guys !

0	thank_you rowan for helping_me resolve my problem :)!
0	i ordered one of their bundles online and from the off , the service was rubbish .
0	sent only part of the order despite telling_me i signed for it all !
0	the bits they forgot to send were the actual camera and bag !
0	phone every day for a week and was promised a call back each day .
0	this never happened .
0	finally spoke to a manager and was assured a call back but again never happened .
0	asked for full_refund to which she said we will refund you in full .
0	i checked what they were refunding and she said £_000 .
0	i had paid £_000 !
0	!
0	the customer_services at this company is a total_joke and in a way i am_glad it all fell through as i found the package cheaper_elsewhere .
0	avoid unless you enjoy hassle
0	i always try and fly ba where i can .
0	subject to acts of god ( thanks for the volcano !)
0	ba nearly always leave on time or within an acceptable time frame .
0	the planes are always clean and the staff on board could not be friendlier .
0	they are also very helpful .
0	maybe not the cheapest about but then you get what you pay for and i have always had a good experience with them .
0	flying with them again next month .
0	both online and in store , i can fault argos .
0	it makes shopping so easy .
0	i really like their reserve and collect , takes the hassle out of a drive into_town to find the item not in stock .
0	that said , its very rare an item is out of stock .
0	00 / 00
0	really happy with the service tesco provides .
0	never had to complain .

0	i have had numerous phones from them as well as various different sim_cards & deals .
0	well_done o0 !
0	great communication , thorough info provided , and a fir deal done .
0	nothing much more to say , just happened in the way it needed to , where competitors that i enquired with seemed intent on making the process hard !
0	my 00 months with vodafone were excellent bar the issue with not putting insurance on my phone which was resolved within a couple of calls to them and receiving a call or 0 back to resolve the matter ; however my next 00 months have been littered with dissatisfaction and stress .
0	the customer service has absolutely_terrible , i think i have made about 00 calls to them , each lasting more than 00_minutes at a time and only ever recieved 0 call_backs after being told each time i would get a call of a manager and on top of the calls about 00 e_- mails have been sent and the only responses i seem to get are generic ' we ' re sorry ' e_- mails , this all started when they gave_me incorrect information over the phone which resulted_in them not taking payment from my account and charging me a fee , not all i asked was for them to pay half the fee and i '_ll pay the other half .... that was 0 months_ago :( very unhappy and stressed out !!!!
0	for a communications company with hundreds of staff , i '_m_sure there is at_least 0 person that i corresponded with that could have helped_me out !!!!
0	not happy in the slightest !!
0	!
0	chose big_bus london tour as they offered a 00 hour ticket which was great for my 0 night stay .
0	the buses were clean and comfortable , were very frequent and there were stops close to all the major attractions .
0	i mainly used the red_route with the live guides .
0	the guides were friendly and helpful , provided an interesting and often humerous commentary .
0	one guide apologised for some traffic delays and ensured that we were provided with rain macs when it started to rain .
0	i also enjoyed the free river_cruise along the thames !
0	thankyou big_bus , i had a great time !
0	i don_'_t pay for next_day delivery ( as it is a waste of money with any company ) and it always arrives within 0 - 0 days .
0	i '_ve built up lots of points which have lead to free supplements .
0	people complained about the courier , i '_ve had two problems with the courier ( not affordable , but dhl ) and they have sent me brand_new tubs , within days - free of charge .
0	its the only website i use for supplements !
0	limit your money over anything .. so they can earn interest on it .. avoid
0	i would recommend this company to anyone , they quickly sent me a reasonable quotation via_email within a couple of hours of filling out the form , i sent the item to them and they literally had the package for half a day before i had my money transferred to me .
0	i dealt_with alex and rich , 0 great friendly people .
0	thanks again !
0	really bad customer service , store manager rude and not helpful ...
0	got all the bits that i wanted , ordered sunday , bits arrived tuesday .
0	great service .
0	organising a stag ?
0	these_guys have got it .
0	i was fussy and they still managed to fit everything i wanted in to my package at very very short_notice .
0	00 idiots running around brighton with no_problems .
0	brilliant .
0	cheers [_name ]!
0	found this website and haven_'_t ordered from a different once since .
0	the prices are the lowest on the internet ( shipping is a little more than others but if you buy in bulk it isn_'_t a big deal ).
0	the fast shipping and freebies added with every purchase really makes this site much more worth it than others .
0	free magazines , free_samples of everything you can think of , low priced supplements , etc .
0	really can '_t be beat .
0	i called printerland on three different occasions while i was trying to sort my businesses dot matrix printer , every time i called the phone was answered within a short_space of time and i was able to deal with 0 person .
0	printerland knew our requirements and were able to match our needs with a printer which has_proven to be perfect for our needs .
0	the after sales have been great and as an icing_on the cake it was the best price for the printer on the web .
0	a great experience
0	i was / am a business customer with talk_talk .
0	probably the worst experience i have ever had .
0	they are happy to trick you into any contract .
0	its obvious that they are only interested in making money for their shareholders and have no morales .
0	their staff all worship the ground talk_talk walk on and their communication with bt open_reach is awful .
0	do not use talk_talk - they are scum .
0	perfect , the delivery arrived earlier_than_expected which is always a bonus .
0	will_definitely be shopping with digitalrev again in the future !
0	: d .
0	cheap good quality so_far ( yn ) and really quick posting
0	i had the dreaded ylod ( yellow light of death ) and i thought that was the end of my ps0 !
0	got in touch with chris booked an appointment for a few_days_later , dropped my console off with him then an_hour later i got a call from him saying its done !
0	couldn_'_t believe_how quick it was and how much of a bargain !
0	would definitely recommend !
0	and would use again !
0	while_searching for the crystal bath for my new home , i luckily found victorian_plumbing .
0	was amazed with its wide_range of products and the description which was very helpful in making the decisions .
0	also the customer service was second to none and the bath was delivered on time .
0	i have recently buy one play station from this site and its really working very smoothly .
0	i am going to buy a one more playstation for my cousin .
0	adverts for selling your mobile have been around for some time .
0	about 0 months_ago i thought i would dig_out my old_phones ( which were just lying_around gather_dust ) and see if they were worth anything .
0	after some_research i decided to use mazuma as they appear to be the largest company doing mobile buybacks and their prices were marginally_better_than their competitors .
0	i got £_00 for the two old_phones but the best thing was the ease of the service , pop details of your old_phones into the mazuma website , wait for the prepaid_envelope to arrive ( it takes only a couple of days ), pop your phones in the envelope ( in some bubble_wrap ) along with the delivery note and send back .
0	it couldn_'_t be easier .
0	a couple of days_later i had the cash in the bank .
0	i now use mazuma to get some cash for my old_mobile whenever i upgrade my phone contract .
0	they are great , well recommendable .
0	once i ' d decided to use quality diamonds i spent a long time assessing their vast_range .
0	i finally chose and ordered a diamond_engagement_ring and received prompt confirmation with an estimated delivery date .
0	the ring was ready a few_days before this and i was given a choice of delivery dates to suit my availability .
0	the ring arrived , as promised , on my chosen date and a few_days_later i popped the question .
0	unfortunately , whilst she said " yes ", the ring turned_out to be a size too big .
0	i contacted quality diamonds and they advised me that i could return the ring to be resized free of charge ( with the exception of the postage back to qd ).
0	i did this and received the resized ring within a week .

0	so stag_do in cardiff with the boys .
0	0 nights of pure carnage drinking !
0	guest_list to some of the bigger bars there which came in useful .
0	gorge scrambling was ace though !
0	perfect way to get_rid of a hangover !
0	overall a great weekend and would recommend chilli_sauce to anyone who hasn_'_t used them .
0	just plug in your dates , and find available hostels , searchable by price of shared or private_rooms , location , etc .
0	the prices are very reasonable and you pay a percentage online before paying the rest there .
0	one thing they are starting to implement is pictures of room types and i strongly encourage them to keep doing this - saves on surprises when you get to your hostel !
0	love the reviews , i honestly have no_qualms with this site , and it '_s my go - to every time i '_m travelling .
0	easy to transfer and very less amount u need to pay as service charge
0	great content and easy to use .
0	ordered my new guitar , paid for next_day delivery .
0	i had to phone_call them the next_day asking about the order because i received no email to confirm my order .
0	i accepted the fact that they could not deliver next_day anymore ( order was placed shortly_after 0pm ).
0	then the next_day , no email confirmation for when the courier was picking the item from the depot .
0	at the end of the day i had to email them and inquire_about the order .
0	it has_been sent to the wrong depot therefore i had to wait another day to get my guitar .
0	in their email they wrote that they ' upgraded ' me to the next_day delivery .
0	it was not my fault and they were supposed to support the entire cost of delivery for this mistake .
0	their replies were always very short and cold .
0	nothing was offered in exchange for this .
0	a friend recommended them but i sure will never ever recommend them based on the way they dealt_with this order .
0	they need to have systems in place to guarantee that they deliver what they promise .
0	great selection of items and brands on an easy to use website , nice big pictures of what they sell so you can see what your buying .
0	reasonably_priced sale and postage_costs with fast delivery too , all the ingredients you need to get people to use you again i think .
0	the company made my shopping_experience wonderful , finding prices i couldn_'_t get anywhere_else and shipping incredibly fast .
0	a must buy for all supplements .
0	online video on how to diagnose the fault , simple easy ordering_process and lots of emails to track progress .
0	excellent service will use again .
0	stag_do to bournemouth was booked with chillisauce , with superb communication and customer service from anton throughout .
0	we booked accommodation ourselves but the handling of the event booking ( rage_buggies , blind driving , clay pigeons and human table footy ) was fantastic .
0	given the low commission companies like this are on i was amazed at the level of contact from anton , the communications and the easy at which i was able to make last_minute changes when the inevitable drop - outs occurred .
0	will_definitely use these_guys again , although hopefully not for a while , being best - man was hard work - but made a whole lot_easier by chillisauce .
0	thanks again guys , ray .
0	i purchased one key and passed the anti_fraud_checks and was emailed stating all further orders would be instant with no further checks , i purchased the same key again for my brother and was again sent an auto email requesting for anti_fraud_checks , of which i replied but unlike the first key i have not yet recieved the 0nd , this is poor as i was told further orders would have no issues , the payment was succesful but i recieved no key , i tried to contact support via skype , facebook , twitter and email , but with no replies , i am not happy with this service .
0	i will update my review if an adequate explanation is given and the issue is resolved promptly , if it isnt then i would suggest taking your custom elsewhere
0	purchases proceesed extremely quickly , lowest_prices i found and every possible payment solution is available , great site keep_up the good work
0	i spent age on internet searching for a replacement quad_bike battery at a good price .
0	searched again & came_across this company .
0	they covered a vast_amount of sizes which meant i could get the exact size .
0	i was more than impressed with the price , especially as it included next_day delivery .
0	i had a couple of questions about the battery which i phoned & asked ' kylie ', which she replied the information friendly & efficiently .
0	i purchased over the phone with kylie , which all went very smoothly & my battery arrived perfectly packaged the next_day .
0	the instructions were easy to follow & the battery works just fine .
0	i am known for being a perfectionist & a bit ' picky ' & i cannot_fault this company in dealing_with my purchase at all .
0	even better is that i save ££ s from buying anywhere_else .
0	thank_you very much , i shall be constantly recommended you .
0	nice and easy site to use , much_better_than others which are far too_busy .
0	seriously cool and user_friendly bit of kit .
0	kicks the teeth out of linnwords and the others

0	anyone who is thinking of ordering any headphones shouldn_'_t hesitate for a second to use these_guys .
0	amazing , honest advice / knowledge of products , friendly staff , great delivery service and an impressive range of top quality headphones / earphones .
0	wish all modern day companies were as good as these .
0	at last a company that cares_about their customers as much as their products .
0	can '_t say enough good words about them .
0	what can i say ?
0	a fraction of the price you would pay in any pharmacy or supermarket .
0	quick delivery , received my order within 0 days of ordering .
0	will use again .
0	absolutely awful !
0	ordered glasses seemingly successfully only to be told a couple of days_later that the frames were discontinued .
0	so i contact customer_services and select another frame .
0	another two_days pass and guess_what .
0	those frames are also discontinued .
0	i then gave up , got my money back and went elsewhere .
0	go to spex0less . com .
0	ordered from them on the monday_night and received my glasses on the thursday_morning .
0	i needed a laptop for work and saw an acer on sale , i figured for £_000 its worth a shot as i only really needed it for basic tasks .
0	let_me tell you this thing is insane !
0	i '_m a gamer and at home have a custom_pc , this laptop is awesome for games and in general i get anything from 00 - 000 fps ranging_from medium to high settings , never need to switch to low .
0	ive never considered acer a company to buy from but this has changed everything .
0	for anyone who_wants more details here are some

0	never had any_issues with them , never had a faulty product , infact i '_m still using some stuff i got from them over 0 years_ago .
0	cons_: none
0	this company is a waste of space , they leave calling_cards but dont knock on the door or ring the bell , trying to call someone is not going to happen , its all automated and has limited options , i emailed them asking that they call my mobile to make_sure i dont miss the item again , they responded with ' its not our drivers job to call you , make_sure you are home '.
0	this is not the first time ive had issues with these_guys .
0	i would ask any company not to use these_guys .
0	i ended_up paying an extra £_00 for a garanteed delivery slot .
0	lets_see what happens ...

0	summary_: awfull service , i feel if i had not called and made a complaint things could have been alot worse and who_knows when i would have got my item , but once i started talking to people on the phone they seemed nice enough and got the item to me asap .
0	website is simple enough and can '_t complain with the prices , but the service is rubish , its ment to be instant delivery ( email code ) but i had to wait around 0 days , i actualy cancelled my oder because the service was so bad , i won_'_t use this site again and have told all my friends to not use it either .
0	thank_you cant_wait to go online and use ur service thank_you for makeing this easy to use
0	pc_specialist rightfully deserves their name , offering relatively cheaper and highly customisable computers than the high_street or any other_retailers .

0	love echo - great delivery , and even dealt_with one of the team on the phone - gave_me some great advice .

0	i found these_guys through word of mouth through one of my friends .
0	have been having a on going battle with vodafone about signal issues and to cut a long_story_short they sent me out a new ( reconditioned ) phone that arrives in a plastic_bag and they take the old one away in a plastic_bag .
0	well that one lasted 0_weeks before it packed us so off it went again .
0	chucked in to the plastic_bag then chucked in to the back of a courier van .
0	about 0_weeks_later i have just received a bill for £_000 for screen damage .
0	?
0	the screen didn_'_t have a scratch on it when it left my hand and went in the plastic_bag .
0	so after about 0 hours on the phone and 0 emails i have been told that it '_s not there problem .
0	if i have an issue i should take it up with there courier they don_'_t want to know and have said they want there £_000 .
0	i feel that this is a disgusting service , i have been with them for 00 years and will have payed them in the region of £_00 , 000 + with my phone and employes .
0	and this is how they treat you .
0	well vodafone i would like to say that me and all my employees will now be getting orange phones so say good buy to your £_000 per_month .

0	their prices are consistently the lowest and more often than not they better amazons prices , which is saying something .
0	i have made over 000 orders with book_depository over about 0 years and am yet to be disappointed by them .
0	amazon . co . uk have the widest_selection of products available to buy out of anyone in the uk , as far as i know .
0	in_conjunction with the excellent choice , they offer some of the best service in the industry , which is remarkable given the popularity and the amount of orders they must receive every day .
0	i check amazon daily for new deals and price drops since they are consistently updating their website and prices .
0	whenever a new game is coming out i always look to pre_- order with shopto before anyone_else .
0	why ?
0	because they ' re consistently the cheapest and offer the best and most reliable service .
0	every game has_been dispatched on time and always arrive on the day , or even early .

0	this is a review of my experience of ' optical_express customer service ' relating to the refund of a deposit for laser_eye_surgery .
0	i had lasik eye_surgery over 0 months_ago .
0	on the day of my first aftercare appointment my wife accompanied me and was tested to see if she was suitable for the same procedure i had had .
0	she was , and so the clinician pressurised us into making the holding_deposit payment of £_000 and booking the procedure then and there .
0	my main_concern at that point was that if i started having side - effects in the following two months leading up to her surgery , would we still be able to cancel and get this money back ?
0	the clinician advised us that ' yes this would get paid back up to 00hrs before the surgery '.
0	so we made the payment and were handed a simple payment receipt .
0	as we left the branch we were given a patient pack , containing all the relevant_documentation and t &_c '_s , but were advised ' don_'_t worry_about reading this now , your wife will need to have a look through it closer to the time of the surgery and come with it signed or ask the surgeon any questions that she may have '.
0	since then i have suffered many acute side - effects including severe dry - eye ( waking me up 0 - 0 times a night with my eye - lids fused together ), ghosting & glare ( making me unable to drive at night ) pain in my eyes , and hugely variable clarity of vision that has meant i have been off work .
0	in fairness oe have been attempting to assist me throughout this with my aftercare regimen , and i am still hopeful that my eyesight will settle_down ( even_though i am upset and angry that the true likelihoods of various side - effects were not fully_explained to me prior to having the procedure ).
0	clearly , having faced these side - effects we decided that it was not wise for my wife to go_ahead with the same procedure .
0	however , we were informed by optical_express that the deposit made is non - refundable and that they only return the money if cancellations are received within_00hrs of booking .
0	for the last 0 months i have written letters , had hugely frustrated phone - calls and am now at my wit '_s end .
0	i still keep getting the company line from their staff , ' due to our terms and conditions this deposit is non - refundable '.
0	these are the same t &_c '_s that were directly contradicted by the advice given to us in the branch at the point - of - sale ; the same t &_c '_s that were handed to us after payment was made and the same t &_c '_s that we were told not to worry_about reading straight_away ( despite the fact that there was a severely limited time - dependant clause on the payment of refunds ).
0	so my advice is simple .
0	do your research on the procedure itself and ask yourself the question are you willing to take the risks .
0	then , and only then , with 000_% certainty should you book a procedure and pay the deposit , as once it '_s paid , you will never see it again .
0	very well_packaged .
0	buying bulbs online left me fearing the light touch of the couriers .
0	paid for the insurance but needn_'_t of bothered .
0	turned_up on time and we can now see at night too !
0	they don_'_t care at all , as a seller you have virtually no protection from scams , even if a buyer has a problem with an item mot of the time the seller loses out even_though its not their fault .
0	lots of hidden_fees , 00_% final value 00p here 00p there paypal .
0	at_least on other platforms they tell you the fees upfront .
0	avoid
0	in store is generally ok . online are useless , loose items send unsigned cheques and take 0_weeks to process orders
0	sent over 000 phones to this company never had a problem
0	i recently used hermes after giving up on them for some years for shockingly rubbish service , it took 0 days ( not including them picking it up on the saturday ) for them to deliver a pc tower which they also managed to dent in the process .
0	the side of this pc tower is 0mm steel so god_knows_how badly it must have been looked after for them to " achieve " that .
0	luckily the buyer was happy enough to live with it as the side wasn_'_t in view .
0	this tower was fortunately of lowish value but was packaged exactly the same as it was when dhl delivered it to me a year previous and clearly_shows from the box what is inside .
0	from that alone anyone with any education would be able to deduce was something not to be playing rugby with .
0	anyway moving on , as a buyer i recently ordered a football_shirt from liverpool . tv and whilst delivery times were good i was at home on the day of delivery and while waiting for a knock ( i just happened to see him turn_up ) i was able to stand and watch when , instead of knocking so i could answer and take half the time it took him to post it , he proceeded to ram it through .
0	i could have been on the loo , wiped and got to the door in the space of time it took him to try and ruin my purchase so no idea how he expected it to save time .
0	in any case , you could argue me plowing through crowds of pedestrians would save time driving through town it doesn_'_t make it the right way to do it .
0	this badly_creased the reciept as well as the item , when i say badly if i ' d made an effort to do it badly i wouldn_'_t have been able to match his expertise .
0	this wouldn_'_t have been so bad but the receipts from the website i ordered from are collectable as they carry a pleasant view of a stand at anfield .
0	he also stood a very real risk of ripping the shirt at the same time which i '_m surprised about as the average letter - box isn_'_t exactly smooth inside ....
0	this was from one of their franchise delivery personal who turned_up in a rough looking people carrier and had no form of uniform , clearly he doesn_'_t take care of the items in his possession and as the same man who picked_up the pc tower i wouldn_'_t be surprised if he was the one who dented the case .
0	still , looking at other reviews , at_least it wasn_'_t left inside a bin or with thieves in the neighbourhood .
0	thanks to the very helpful rep lizzie on p0g chat i cancelled the delivery i booked today for an item sale on ebay that fell through , wasn_'_t expecting anything back but within 00_minutes on chat i left happy enough to say thanks on here for it .
0	made up for being messed_around on ebay !
0	where do i start ?
0	well , my gf and i were looking into buying a car with cash but decided to take a look at stebbings with a view to finance on a car .
0	the first day we tried to view a car we were left waiting half an_hour without being seen ( and weren_'_t ther only ones !)
0	because it was a weekend and they only had 0 staff on .
0	i thought weekends would be the best time for most people to view cars ....
0	anyway we returned in the week and after 00_minutes this time we were helped out and given a key to view a car .
0	the key itself was broken which should have been an omen but on we went , enjoyed the test_drive even_though the car had no diesel in at all so we had to go back the next_day to adctually drive it , all we could do was look !
0	in the end we payed and left , then straight_away things went_downhill .
0	the day we were due to pick_up the car the guy dealing_with us was off ill , they had no idea we were even coming so had to wait while someone went off to find then clean the car in a hurry , must have taken over an_hour .
0	the car went for it '_s mot before coming to us and failed with numerous advisorys which were conveniently absent from the mot we we given , though we know it had problems as it says on the governments own mot website !
0	nothing at all was mentioned about them either .
0	to pass the mot it needed a tyre , so they replaced just one even_though the other was near legal_limit , wipers were replaced as the old ones weren_'_t clearing the window even_though the " mark " was actually a huge scratch on the glass which really should not have passed , niether should the seatbelt that doesn_'_t retract any faster_than it would take a snail to cover the same distance ( we ' re_talking minutes here ).
0	within 0 days we had the first engine fault light come up , having my own scanner i read the fault code and it told me the turbo was overboosting .
0	when we rang them they claimed it was due to not being driven for a while and to give it a full_tank of fuel , suffice to say this didn_'_t work .
0	being a self - clearing fault it went but came back daily if the car was even driven slightly hard ( like dring an over - take as often is / was the case ).
0	dangerously when this light came on power would suddenly be lost leading to some very dangerous situations , not good when you have a gf and her 0 year_old in the car , performing what should easily be a safe text - book overtake .
0	by the time we realised it wasn_'_t going away we ' d already gone over 0000 miles , which is all they allow for under warantee .
0	i wonder_why it '_s so low ( 0000 miles or 0 month )?
0	*_cough *_*_cough *.
0	since then within 0 months the seat has broken , it '_s needed a new tyre , it turns_out they didn_'_t service it at all so we had to spend over £_000 on that , it has continuously givn error codes and engine warning lights , various_bits have fallen_off and to take the mickey now the turbo is only boosting at 0psi and we '_ve so_far spent_hundreds without getting to the bottom of why it '_s so slow now , can '_t even keep_up with a petrol tanker going up a hill ( true story :( ).
0	also the steering_wheel column feels loose .
0	their adverts currently state " we '_ll buy every car " and going by the standard they '_ll sell you any as well , even if it '_s clearly full of faults , as by the time you notice somethign isn_'_t right it '_s too late .
0	the whole ordeal has_been terrible and considering we spent over £ 0000 on a car what we '_ve had start to finish has_been shockingly_bad , plus now we are stuck with a car that needs to last another 0 years but definately won_'_t without thousands being spent :'( i would say please don_'_t let them make a mug of you too , stay well away and use a company with a more professional_approach who will sell you something you should rightly get for your money and not something that will make life hell or even worse kill you .
0	don_'_t need to review this one much really , dropped it off after the school_run at 0 . 00 and was surprised by a call at 0 . 00 to say the car was ready .
0	credit due to north street tyres in lynn .
0	so i sent my ohone in for repair on the 00th_may 0000 , today is the 0th_june_0000 and i still yet to recieve my phone back .
0	i had to go into two phones0u stores and the people were not helpful at all , they didn_'_t know what they were doing and ended_up having to speak to people over the phone .
0	they said it would take around 00 days to get my phone repaired and sent back to me .....
0	the phone had a slight_crack on the back so that had to be repaired before any warranty issues could be sorted_out , they didn_'_t email me saying that the back needed to be repaired i had to phone up chasing them .
0	i once sent my old phone to htc and they repaired it and sent it back to me within a week , this is appalling and they have no excuse for taking so long
0	dispatched quickly , and even_though they came from malta , arrived within 0 days .
0	very good around the christmas_period
0	this website is better_than any other website or store you can go to simply because they have the best customer service , and easiest site to use .
0	i '_ve not found another place anywhere that does a on the spot price match and then even lowers it !
0	absolutely amazing , supplement_warehouse is the only place i '_ll ever buy supplements from for the rest of my life !
0	: d
0	absolutely fantastic service with great staff who will do anything to help .
0	was left upstairs to test out guitars / amps for as long as i needed and even popped back a second time .
0	these_guys had the best price around and some products including the guitar i bought even cheaper in store they even put in a pair of spare strings to take home too .
0	very friendly and willing to go the extra_mile .
0	will be now using this when i come to buying my amp in the next month or two .

0	they have included a promotions extra which gains you extra things when you win which i feel is fantastic and the winners club is great for some extra club benefits .
0	not only do i win in different_ways but i actually gain other benefits throughout – such a great , honest , rewarding and reliable company .
0	i was able to deposit and withdraw funds with ease , i usually use the visa method which is very quick and no issues come_across it which is fantastic !

0	thank_you
0	the website couldn_'_t provide the information i need for an order , so spoke to catherine on live_chat , she was a great help and processed the order quickly without_any_issues .
0	will use parcel 0 go again
0	having decided on the 00mm_prime i scoured web for the best price .
0	no one uk_based could come close to digitalrev .
0	even better still the delivery only took 0 days !
0	as quick , if not quicker_than some uk companies i '_ve_used in the past .
0	i paid for the goods last wednesday_afternoon and was very happy to say my nori sheets and sushi kit arrived the next_day .
0	i received an email to say it had been dispatched and was kept_informed - top_class !
0	my girlfriend was well impressed with my sushi making skills :) and next time will_defo order more sushi gear .

0	excellent service .
0	for a first time purchaser the system was very easy to use and very reassuring .
0	no_problems at any stage and a really fast service .
0	would recommend to anyone_wanting to buy coin without the worry .
0	i booked a lesson on the bsm website for a certain date but was very disappointed when after that date bsm had still not found me a driving_instructor & did not even bother to contact me to inform_me about the matter .
0	i cancelled the lesson as i was disappointed with there poor service & asked for a refund i was told it would take seven working_days for a full_refund to be paid back in to my account , after seven day '_s i had still not received a refund i contacted bsm again to inform them about this when they assured me that a refund would be made right away only i was still_waiting for a refund seven_days after that .
0	the service from bsm is very poor indeed .
0	i found the service at mazumamobile . com to be very good indeed .
0	fast hassle_free & helpful .
0	i would definitely use again .
0	i have starting buying all my supplements here .
0	great buy and the less expensive company on the market , fast delivery time , and i will_continue to buy supplements here .
0	i would recommend this to anyone
0	it '_s really good , £_00 . 00 for a 00month xbl price is a good deal .
0	as for the service i payed via_paypal after an easy phone verification and the email was sent to my account instantly .
0	would use again !
0	as is always the case in dealing_with sue ( damo or heather ), the service was fantastic .
0	i '_m the typical awkward designer client - wanting everything done yesterday and on a budget .
0	regardless my request , sue was on the ball and got it turnaround - 0 days early !
0	i definitely should be on a commission for how often i recommend them to other designers !
0	pleasure to do so knowing the level of service and quality that is given .
0	always beating prices .
0	shipping pretty fast .
0	can '_t beat it .
0	im really impressed with diamond_geezer .
0	the name might not sound as prestigious as ernest jones for example but the quality is and a lot cheaper .
0	i '_ve just bought my wedding_ring and like for like it was £_000 cheaper .
0	communication is great with regular_emails_letting you know where they are up to with your order .
0	they were bang on with the estimated delivery date as well .
0	can '_t fault them .

0	went into the derby store to buy a sim only deal because i already had a phone and just needed a sim_card for a few_months .
0	after being given a sim only contract at a good price and assured that i could cancel it with 00 days notice with notice , i proceeded to use it for about 0 months .
0	then my phone broke and i had to cancel the sim only deal .
0	i went to the shop and was told they couldn_'_t do it and i had to ring customer_services .
0	after ringing the extortionate customer service line , i was politely told that i had been misinformed by the shop and that i was on a 00 month business deal and had to pay £_000 to cancel it .
0	i had not been told any of this information and was ever so slightly peeved .
0	therefore i would recommend not going near o0 and especially near the derby store unless you happen to be riding a bulldozer .
0	very good service very quick got the info in a clear and concise manor .
0	it '_s easy to navigate , has all of the hostels you ' d want in the places you want to go , and there are never any booking_fees !
0	what more could you want ?
0	!
0	always process my order fast and ships fast too .
0	some prices are not always the best but do a little searching and find a lower price so they can beat it .
0	the above title is in reference to a meme in case you think i '_m some illiterate fool !
0	anyway back to the review ...... overall i would give my experience a 00 / 00 ......... sit_back relax and let_me explain_why .
0	when i first placed my order i paid via_paypal and i got a confirmation_email which said it was received .
0	several minutes lady i got a further email_saying my payment was rejected .
0	the following_morning i got a further email from your customer_services saying i could phone a number to give another form of payment or just reorder the product .... so i was well informed .
0	i remembered when i received the confirmation_email of the original order that it had a 00_%_off voucher for my next order .... you can see where i '_m going with this ... no - brainer really , replace the order apply the 00_% coupon use different payment_method come out at the end of it £ 0 . 00 richer ... result .
0	if it had not of been for the voucher sneakiness i probably would give a 0 . 0 / 00 due to the payment issues .
0	thanks ,
0	john
0	when ever ive ordered online , we have never suffered any_problems from tesco and 0 times out of 00 even the substitutions are better items .
0	i ordered my item 00th_october , and after emailing and leaving messages for 0_weeks i eventually got a reply , it promised me my item next couple of days , sent by a women .
0	anyway i eventually got hold of the owner and was able to text his mobile , he explained the situation , but i still did get a few false_promises , but at_least i was able to communicate , anyway after all the snow had buggered off , i did get my tracking_number and finally my item , yes it was frustrating having to wait that long but i also understand they have to be made as it does state .
0	but i do believe the customer service needs to improve , but the item is fantastic .
0	yes i would use again but by then hopefully delivery issues will be sorted .
0	digital product was delivered immediately after purchase and worked straight_away .
0	at such a low price this was a great bargain !
0	the lowest_price i could_find for diablo_0 and the cd_key was sent within a few minutes .
0	thanks a lot for the quick service and excellent price .
0	was very quick and simple payment and quick delivery , will buy from here again
0	we are a trading website selling our own_brand of cat_litter .
0	we use parcel0go for all of our packages , they offer a great range of services and are very helpful all the time .
0	the website itself was very easy to use and very attractive .
0	the sidebars categorized the various items that they have available and the option to search by brand was conveniently positioned .
0	i had brought a pair of headphones which were really tight on my big head and uncomfortable for gaming use , i called up hifiheadphones and an exchange was arranged instantly with my new product reserved for me by an enthusiastic member of staff .
0	great companies in my opinion are those who can turn an unsatisfied customer into a satisfied one .
0	the customer thus is overall more pleased with the service than if they were not unsatisfied in the first place and take the time out of their day to write several words on a website such as this recommending the company that made the effort to resolve their problem .
0	ordered on the wednesday , received on the thursday , great selection of products and easy service
0	very good service and products .
0	all of my products arrives very quickly and as_described on the website .
0	the company offers a wide_range of top quality products which cater for all outdoor pursuits .
0	i purchased a breitling montbrilliant legende watch with all papers and display bos etc .
0	from watchfinder . co . uk for a large_sum of money .
0	it arrived very securely_packaged and as_described with regard to condition / papers etc .
0	with only one minor_issue ; there was no cosc certificate .
0	i decided to get in touch with alex stonely ( sales_manager ) to inform him of this .
0	i was given the option of sending the watch and papers back to watchfinder for them to send to breitling service centre uk to secure a replacement cosc certificate free of charge !
0	i must_say that should i purchase another watch in the future , regardless of the value , i will_certainly be enquiring here first !
0	cannot recommend highly_enough , i don_'_t normally take the time to review services which i have utilised , however , in this case i feel_compelled to .
0	philip d keeling
0	website was clear and easy to use .
0	i had one or two other questions which i just wanted to clarify with them , and these were answered by the experts on the phone .
0	when the rads were delivered ( within two_weeks of my order being placed ) a couple of them had multiple scratches / smudged paint work - possibly due to courier rather_than manufacturer .
0	i took photos of these and emailed them in and within minutes i received a reply offering for an exchange , which i accepted .
0	two_weeks_later replacement rads turned_up in perfect_condition and the others were returned .
0	very pleased with the service and looking_forward to getting some more in when we do the next part of the house .
0	i have been trying for months to unlock my iphone 0 ( 0 . 0 . 0 , 0 . 00 . 00 ) with no success , i saw this company '_s reviews and decided to try them out .
0	behold !
0	my iphone was unlocked under 0 hours !
0	can you believe it ... it works ... try them , it truly works ... i '_m using my phone now on t - mobile .... you can take their promise to the bank !
0	the person_who dealt_with us was very understanding , professional , not at all pushy and managed to save us a significant_amount ofm money on our life assurance , would happily reccommend
0	i have used these_people numerous_times and they '_ve always delivered on time at a very good price .
0	there was a problem at their depot once but they were straight on the phone apologising and offering new delivry dates etc so can '_t fault them at all and will_continue to use them .
0	i like this company and buy from them regularly .
0	they do a good range of good quality products and i normally find the staff instore knowledgeable and willing to give impartial_advice on the ' best ' products etc .
0	i have also had to return footware to them ( hi - tec which had split and broken horribly , not their own_brand ) months outside of their normal returns_policy and they took them back , without a receipt , and gave mea full_refund and then a discount on the new boots i bought , can '_t say_fairer_than that !
0	thanks !
0	use these all the time and saved_loads as a result .
0	i chose to use them over other similar_sites initially because they weren_'_t involved in any of the ridiculous and tacky advertising that has_been going on of late .
0	however i am a little disappointed to see that they may too be going down that route now too ..... perhaps i '_ll have to look for another comparison site ?
0	!
0	my wife and i were looking for a nintendo dsi for our daughter '_s birthday and found this site .
0	they were offering it at a good price and so we ordered on 00 june_0000 .
0	they said it would be dispatched within_00hrs ; it wasn_'_t .
0	our daughter '_s birthday was on 00 july and despite_numerous_emails and phonecalls ( more of which later ), we decided to cancel the order , which we did on 00 july_0000 and had to go to argos and buy one in store for significantly more money .
0	in cancelling , we formally requested a full_refund , but despite_numerous further emails and phonecalls ( definately some more later !)
0	we still do not have a refund , and today is 00 spetember 0000 .
0	my wife has now contacted her card provider to raise a dispute in order to try and get our money back .
0	by the way , in relation to the phone_calls , don_'_t bother ringing them , it simply a voicemail_message_telling you to email them ..... now thats customer service .
0	i feel ashamed to have used this company now i have seen these other reviews .
0	for anyone_else considering using these_people , please seriously_consider whether its worth it .

0	they offer a good range of products at good prices and offer an excellent returns_policy .
0	we as a family do nearly all our christmas shopping through amazon each year and they have never yet let us down .
0	thoroughly reccommended
0	i '_ve been with bt for quite a number of years and just have the constant niggling feelign that they ' re conning me .
0	i feel as though i am paying way too much for broadband etc but can '_t face calling them because i don ; t have half a day to waste on the phone on hold to then be put through to someone i struggle to understand .
0	i '_m just waiting for sky_broadband ( the fast one ) to make it to my area and i '_ll be switching
0	i '_ve only really started_using next over the past couple of years since opening an online account with them
0	they '_ve been excellent .
0	very fast delivery of goods and their returns_policy is very good too .
0	i also like the flexibility of being_able to arrange delivery to my door or go to the store down the road to collect
0	i like ebay overall and have got some good value stuff , but i don_'_t enjoy the agro you can get from other users .
0	i have only ever sold two items through ebay , on one i was accused by a bidder of bidding myself to jack the price up , which i wasn_'_t , and the other i had difficulties getting paid by someone_who kept claiming they had when they had not .
0	its good in principle but for me not worth the hassle when selling
0	play offer a good range of products and normally at pretty good prices too .
0	they always deliver very quickly and i have never had a problem with any goods from them despite having used them for numerous years_now .
0	i also like the fact i can buy from their trusted buyers too and get things cheaper second_hand if i like
0	we use tesco all the time for food and fuel and find them excellent .
0	we collect club card vouchers throughout the year and cash them in each summer to take the kids on days out to theme parks etc
0	i ordered a nikon l000 and case on 00 july_0000 , they said it would be delivered within 0 - 0 days , it wasn_'_t .
0	i contacted them to ask what was going on as i needed it for a birthday_present and had ordered in good faith expecting delivery within timescales advertised .
0	email response simply said they couldn_'_t gaurentee when i ' d get it .... not good enough .
0	so i cancelled the order before the end of july .
0	i spoke to their customer_services who said i ' d get a refund within 0 - 0 days and also got an email confirmation that they ' d received my cancellation .
0	i still_haven_'_t received my refund and have had to resort to raising a dispute with my bank to see if they can get me my money back .
0	i will never use this company again and would warn anyone_else from dealing_with them too .
0	it was straightforward , i put the imei_number on website , got the quote and got free post envelope from mazuma in couple of days .
0	posted my phone ( better to get proof of receipt as it gives you cover up to £_00 on free post ) and got my money directly paid into bank in couple of days .
0	highly_recommended .
0	sammie_taylor was a great help .
0	nice and easy to get the necessary_information :)
0	i took out van insurance , which i was told would mirror my no claims from the car .
0	0_weeks on i have been told that it was mis sold - in order to mirror the no claims i have to be 00 ( which i am in 0 months ), but the sales_advisor didn_'_t check this criteria thus mis sold me the insurance !
0	they have cancelled and refunded in full - but now i '_m stuck without insurance and since i can '_t mirror the no claims i have to pay £_000 more - i wouldn_'_t have bought the van had they have informed me when quoting !
0	avoid !
0	ordered some items off the website , 0 hours_later i receive a phone_call stating they will be cancelling my items !
0	wont be using ever again !
0	as an_avid user of parcels0go , i recently had a terrible experience .
0	i sent a glass hob via them , and it was smashed in transit .
0	parcels0go said it had been returned to them , so i didnt need to send photos of the damage , as they had the item .
0	0_weeks_later without compensation , they then sent the item back , and demanded i sent images of the damage !
0	what a joke !
0	they then offered £_00 compensation for a £_000 item !
0	!
0	use someone_who actually care about the customer !
0	pgs were great from the moment i contacted them to the completion of the removal of some wasp and hornet nests .
0	charges explained both when making the appointment and on the pest controllers arrival .
0	an appointment was offered for the following_day and the chap arrived at the beginning of the one hour time_slot .
0	explained what he was going to do , shared his_knowledge throughout and completed the task at hand .
0	very impressive and a good guy to boot .
0	i am pleased with the speed of service !
0	bought 0 tickets for gipsy kings in london which were sold out on the official site of royal_albert_hall and they arrived on the next_day !
0	we are a company of 0 so tickets were next to each other which is great !
0	would buy again from double0 and recommended it to family and friends .
0	very reliable company for business and personal use , would recommend to anyone , i use it mostly for business

0	very fast excellent service a +++++++ would repair again
0	i felt a bit_weary of ordering such prized presents online , since my local whisky emporium closed its doors recently , but i was pleasantly and overwhelmingly surprised by the detail , accuracy and overall professionalism shown by the whiskey_exchange , suggesting new , and unheard of complimentary spirits to what i was looking at made me a tad bit more adventurous than usual .
0	once checked out nothing is left to chance , and i received instant_confirmation and an on - going dialog of order status_updates which where reassuring and not overly invasive .
0	overall i would highly_recommend this online store for any spirit requirements .
0	i am the first to readily admit that when it comes to getting things printed i usually head straight down the road and get scalped by my local print shop , as well i dont have a clue what any of the paper weights / configurations mean .
0	so i finally did some home work and found out what kind of spec i tend to be drawn too , and found print00 really useful in selecting what i needed , even when it seemed really technical their help bubbles popped up to assist me into selecting the correct choices .
0	from my point of view as a relative novice at this kind of online ordering i found it a tad technical at times but easy enough to make heads and tails of what i was after in the end .
0	i think that maybe the site was experiencing a bit of traffic at the time as it was slow at updating the prices but i was more than happy with the quotes given compared to my local shop , it was definitely worth the time scoping through the technical details .
0	as for the end_result i was first of all amazed at the delivery speed , and the fact they sent me text_updates was helpful , but the finished product was simply , brilliant .
0	i would highly_recommend print00 to anyone who is looking for a quick , cheap and most of all high_quality finish for their printing_needs .
0	price is great , delivery time is short , no_problems at all
0	cheapest supplier i could_find using google .
0	my order was with me within 00_hours , all in perfect_condition .
0	we received a confirmation_email_saying the order had been received , we also received a notification of dispath , but have not received anything yet .
0	we have tried to contact by phone and email but cannot get an answer .
0	i will be reporting this to credit_card company to try get my money back
0	excellent , friendly service .

0	i ordered off of bodybuilding . com for almost 0 years but when found supplementwarehouse . com , i could not go back even if i wanted to .
0	the free_samples and merchandise are amazing .

0	i will order from supplementwarehouse . com forever .

0	by far supplement_warehouse gives the best deals and prices out there on supplements anybody who is professional or beginning needs to order from here because of their great service , prices and reviews , i will never ever set foot in another supplement store again !
0	choice and availability of chocolate is second to none .
0	easy to order and the prices are reasonable compared to high_street prices .
0	quick delivery too !
0	would recommend to anyone looking for something different than your normal chocolate available in other stores .
0	i ordered the bose computer musicmonitor speakers from hispek electronics .
0	i had been searching for a while for some good speakers at a decent price and these were the best deal available from anywhere i had seen .
0	i chose the standard delivery service but even then they turned_up the next_day !
0	i was very please with the service and the speakers are awesome .

0	0_star because of the best service via online website i have experienced
0	not even remotely close to what i ordered in colour of flowers used with cheaper substitutes used to bulk out the bunch massively .
0	the six large gerberas pictured were replaced with two mini - heads .
0	the vibrant multicoloured bunch i ordered were delivered entirely white and yellow ( but for the two red mini - gerberas ).
0	customer service ' assured ' me that half a bunch of gyp and a stuffing of carnations are of equal value and quality to gerberas , lisianthis and chrysanthemums .
0	avoid like the plague .
0	just didn_'_t bother turning_up with my flowers on mother '_s day .
0	left my mother waiting all day for them .
0	had no customer service available on the sunday itself , so i waited_until the monday .
0	they have no phone number so you have to wait for an adviser to speak to you online - so they closed the service for the entire day .
0	i finally got an email and they offered to deliver the following_day ( mothering tuesday ?!)
0	at full cost .
0	out of the goodness of their hearts they did offer me £ 0 off my next order though , as if i ' d ever order from them again to benefit .
0	i couldn_'_t recommend enough using one of the ' proper ' flower retailers on line rather_than this bunch of jokers .
0	i don_'_t think i '_ve ever been so angry .
0	really pleased with my purchases , the staff are very helpful !
0	will_definetly shop_here in the future .
0	i ordered a game , but had no email from moby_memory ( ext ref removed ) either to confirm the order , or to say it had been despatched .
0	i emailed them a week_later to ask whether it had been sent , saying i ' d heard_nothing .
0	a week_later , they replied , sending a claim_form because they said it had been despatched .
0	i returned the claim_form , and waited .
0	a week_later , no response , so i resent it and asked if they ' d received it .
0	a week_later again , still nothing , so i asked them to just give me a refund .
0	another week_later , still nothing , so i filed a paypal_dispute .
0	this kicked them into action , and they immediately refunded my money along with the following message :
0	---
0	" your first return back to us as -- not called for
0	from royalmail -- means you did not pick_up the item .
0	due to the christmas_break and office open on 0th do not help with the delays in answer emails or phone ,
0	there has_been breakdown in the internet which has deleted the emails ."
0	---
0	so ...
0	( 0 ) supposedly they sent it and and was returned to them .
0	not only have i not had a royal_mail card through the door , but considering the other reviews here , does anyone really think it likely that they ' re telling the truth ?
0	( 0 ) " you did not pick_up the item " all capitalised .
0	not the most professional way to deal with your customers is it ?
0	( 0 ) the christmas / new year break has no relevance whatsoever - the total_lack of communication all dates from after the 0th of january .
0	( 0 ) " there has_been breakdown in the internet ".
0	classic , absolutely classic !
0	so in all , it '_s full of excuses , and it took the threat of a claim_against them through paypal , before they ' d do anything .
0	i cannot stress enough , buy elsewhere !
0	i bought a lanparte rig and i asked if they could dispatch it as soon as possible because i needed it in 0 week ( i live in greece ).
0	they actually send the product the same day and it arrived on time .
0	furthermore , they also replied to my request with an email , which is an amazing thing for the customer , to get some feedback and know that thise people actually read .
0	i will need some stuff very soon and i will_definitely buy again from camerakings . co . uk
0	thank_you .

0	athens , greece
0	i found speegraphic through google looking for a specific product .
0	it was the first i got to see their online store , being a bit_skeptical at first .
0	after_reading all the positive_reviews in trustpilot i decided to proceed .
0	- they are fast on dispatch
0	- packaging of the package was good
0	- i got fast reply on an email after the purchase
0	- tracking_number for the package was available
0	i am located in greece ( athens ) and i would recommend to anyone trying out this store .
0	they deserve a good look .

0	prices are low , everything arrives fast and in great condition .
0	best golf shop i used at the internet .
0	i found this company when i was looking to replace a lost set of headphones and having read some positive information about them i thought i would give them a shot and i am pleased that i did .
0	having placed my order on a friday and choosing their standard delivery option i was extremely pleased when my new headphones arrived on the saturday .
0	their communication_throughout the process was great and it was reassuring to have each_stage of the ordering_process made clear to me so i was always aware of what was happening .
0	the product itself is also very good and having purchased it based on a recommendation placed on a forum by an hifiheadphones . co . uk representative i was also pleased to find that they know what they are talking_about and weren_'_t simply trying to flog me a pair of expensive headphones in order to make a sale .
0	overall i would highly_recommend hifiheadphones . co . uk and should i find myself in the market for another set i would not_hesitate to buy from them again .
0	very pleased with the item , process and the speed at which it was despatched .
0	will use again and recommend to others .
0	they responded to my email very fast .
0	very happy with the next_day delivery .
0	couldn_'_t ask for anymore .
0	slendid service , standard 0nd_class delivery arrived 0 days_later , perfect_condition well_packaged .
0	one fault ordered an extension with a snooker cue , when the extension is attatched there is a rather large step between the cue and extension at the joint , not a big deal really as the extension wont get used much .
0	overall very pleased : d .
0	as far as prices are concerned this place is great , and not to mention the discounts and free stuff too .
0	ordered today so we will see how fast the shipping is .
0	mothers_day flowers not delivered - i was on holiday and so couldn_'_t be with my mother on day so figured some flowers were the least i could do .
0	thanks iflorist for ruining that for me .
0	sent three emails so_far and nothing in response - their livechat never seems to be on .
0	essentially this company has stolen £_00 from me .

0	donna bromilow and wayne thomas have been exceptional with assistance and customer_support .
0	i work for a customer_support service area which give me the basis to comment on the excellent service i have received .
0	thank_you for all your help .
0	i searched all over the web for my products .
0	they were the cheapest here hands_down .
0	shipping and handling was rather high but i suppose with the free_shaker and free 0 months of mens_health i got with it , it was worth it .
0	what a bargain , came at the right time when i was low on money !
0	!
0	good that you only have pay 00 percent of the payment rather_than full upfront .
0	i prefer to use paypal as it means i only have to use my card_details once and i am less likely to be targeted by the keystroke bots that could pinch my card_details as i type them in !
0	ordered an apc ups from this company as i have many_times before and cannot_fault them .
0	never had a issue with an item not being in stock and delivery is always prompt .
0	they also give you loyalty_points when you spend money which can be used for pretty decent gifts ( not cheap pens and stuff !)
0	they always have the best products on sale !
0	order was placed the same day as it was dispatched so very appreciative of there speeds !
0	contacted their support about a payment issue and it was resolved swiftly !
0	i ordered a mw0 key around midnight and a couple hours_later received the cd_key .
0	even_though it was a russian one and i had to use a vpn to install , it was a breeze to do .
0	they offered to install it if i didn_'_t want to go through the hassle .
0	i downloaded the english_version off steam so it '_s like i just got back from a game store only i paid less_than half the price !
0	i ordered a delivery for ( rather expensive ) flowers for valentines_day to go to an address in belgium .
0	the flowers were not delivered on the day or on the following_day .
0	as a result i emailed ( they dont have a telephone_number !)
0	requesting a refund .
0	i received no reply until 0 days_later when i received a ' reply ' completely_ignoring my previous message and stating that the address was wrong .
0	now given that the address was exactly the same address i had provided them with for a previous successful delivery this seems a little strange to put it mildly .
0	so $_00 paid in return for which ... no flowers delivered , no response to a refund request , impossible to speak to someone as they have no phone number and they send an email 0 days after the flowers were due for delivery saying a building they have previously delivered to does not exist .
0	draw your own_conclusions ...
0	i found every thing i was looking for and was pleased by how easy it was for me to find what i was looking for .
0	so_far so good , seem ok for contact but not had to make a claim yet ...
0	they were brilliant , delivered less_than 00_hours after i ordered , i got a 00_%_discount , and the flowers were amazing
0	from_start to finish was perfect .
0	the whole order was delivered in one package on 00th_december but when i opened it up , the nike class wov suit in navy / blue size medium tracksuit was missing the trousers .
0	i fully checked through the bag but i appear to have only been sent the tracksuit top and not the bottoms .
0	i tried to call customer_services twice as i hadn_'_t heard back via_email , both_times i have been put onto hold for around 00_minutes .
0	when i finally got through to the advisor on the end of the line , my order reference was taken and then i was cut_off when i was put back onto hold .
0	mattress was delivered the next_day , in perfect_condition .
0	it '_s incredibly comfy !
0	i read a few reviews having placed the order and started to get a little_worried .
0	but i didn_'_t need to be .
0	really good service and product !
0	this is the second time i have used gear0music and it has exceeded all my expectations .
0	i shall_continue to use them as my no .
0	0 stop and can reccomend them to anyone .
0	a friend recommended me to distinctly legal and therefore i knew i can '_t have made the wrong choice .
0	my claim went on for a long time however the company was with me every moment of the way .
0	great updates on the claim via_email post and telephone .
0	there was always someone to speak to and help with any_queries i had .
0	overall , an excellent service and will most definitely use them again if i need in the future .

0	i found the ram that i needed for my laptop , on here , cheaper_than i could_find it anywhere_else on the internet ... with a lifetime_warranty : d
0	the member of staff that i talked to on the phone before purchasing the ram was also very helpful and polite , and she made me feel_valued as a potential customer .
0	i received the memory in just a few_days , and i '_m really very happy , as it '_s working brilliantly .
0	i would definitely buy any memory that i would need in the future , from here :)
0	thing with this company is they have great emails highlighting one category of products .
0	nothing pushy , just honest and it '_s all there and available .
0	that is what counts .
0	thanks guys .
0	these_guys know how to dispatch .
0	always quick and easy .
0	if you need to chat before you place the order they are equally prompt and helpful .
0	never miss a beat with monster .
0	from purchasing to delivery , i know what is happening .
0	just the way online shopping should be .
0	always receive my products in record time .
0	keep_up the good work .
0	i had a dispute that ran for months regarding someone_who bought something from me then mistakenly charged back when they didn_'_t recognise the purchase on their credit_card statement .
0	paypal is okay when you don_'_t have an issue , but when the time comes that you do , you will witness what a horrible company it really is .
0	don_'_t take my word for it , there are thousands of victims of chargeback fraud telling their stories online and websites dedicated to exposing paypal .
0	arrogant , mealy - mouthed customer service ( call_centre ).
0	hollow promises about how they are ' on the seller '_s side '.
0	frustrating bureaucracy and automated customer service that can '_t answer your problem .
0	i will do everything i can to avoid using paypal ever in my life .
0	i received a text shortly_after_placing my online order telling_me who would be delivering and at what time ( 00 till 0 ).
0	it also gave_me the option of texting back to change my delivery date to various other options .
0	great communications .
0	as promised , john arrived on time with my parcel .
0	i commented on the text service and we had a 0 minute chat in which it was clear he was very enthusiastic about his job and the company he works for .
0	that night i ordered something again , around 0 pm , and was pleased to get a text_telling_me dpd were handling delivery and it would be with me by lunch time the next_day .
0	and it was !
0	having had some awful experiences with delivery firms , i was really impressed with dpd .
0	very good and fast service , good prices and customer service
0	i love this website .
0	i always check here first for all my supplements .
0	great prices and fast shipping .
0	look here first before you go_anywhere_else .
0	ordered a new av_amp and 0 . 0 speakers through creative_audio / audio_express .
0	good value and range of peripherals / options with kit .
0	helpful set - up guide included which was a nice_touch and very useful without being overly " techie "
0	i had a couple of small things missing from my speaker_stands ( not their fault ) - they very quickly contacted the manufacturer and i had the missing parts the following_day !
0	excellent customer service and speedy / efficient service , would highly_recommend / use again .
0	i ordered a pirelli_p - zero runflat tyre .
0	it arrived at the recommended garage quickly and was fitted well without_any fuss .
0	furthermore , the tyre was far cheaper_than most other_places and all in all - a very good service .

0	excellent service from tyres on the drive , both from the staff who phoned to confirm the booking through to my friendly technician , andy , who made an excellent job .
0	i won_'_t hesitate to use this company again and will recommend to friends and family .
0	also , superb value !!
0	cheers .
0	i used spectronics to help me find a suitable pc .
0	they helped guide me towards the best one for me suited to my work and social needs .
0	they helped make the complex things understandable and the end product i received was spectacular .
0	i ordered a mac which was quick to arrive and i got the best value for my money .
0	i would recommend using spectronics for all your computing_needs and issues .
0	ordering the shed was easy and informative .
0	i had a tight_space to build my shed and i needed to know the dimensions quite accurately .
0	the website had all the information that i needed and what '_s more , it was at the right price .
0	i bought a 0ft x_0ft shed and i '_m not a builder , but with a little building knowledge can be erected with just one person .
0	quality of the shed is to be expected at this price too but the overall look and feel of the shed means that i have a product that i '_m really happy with .
0	i couldn_'_t fault flashbay in any way .
0	it was great to talk to someone and discuss my order .
0	delivery came on - time and this was just before_christmas when , as we all know , deliveries can be precarious at best .
0	i would certainly recommend this company to anyone .
0	prices were really good too !
0	i have shopped couple of times with millitary 0st and i can say i have been satisfied all the time with my shopping . very professional people that always recognised the needs of customers . i will and i have already recommend millitary 0st to my friends .
0	where it stands at the moment it is my favourite online shop for security equipment .
0	keep_up the work team .

0	i used to love dialtosave and made it my only option of purchase for international cards but now its been losing my customs due to technical_error which keeps on repeating all the time . as a busy man i found it a bit_annoying to contact customer service everytime .
0	the last time i use it on the 00 / 00 /_0000 the operator would not tell me how much credit i have after i '_ve topped_up and before it use to remember my password from the phone i use but now it kept asking me to enter it again . thats a bit_disappointing and i found it only going down instead of improving the service . i would have understood if it was a one off technical_error but it doesnt_seem so . communication does cut_off at some point too . i have noticed as well that during winter time customers get lower credit for the same amount of money use to purchase during summer time .
0	it has now reach a point that i will have no other choice than looking for another option .
0	customer service wise i would say excellent . the team we have behind has always acted professionally and fast . impeccable .
0	well_done to the customer service team . i think you deserve another 0_stars .
0	regards

0	bought wifi for 00_hours and only got an_hour usage due to he wifi going down in just my room .
0	went to reception and they put me through to internet provider , got it fixed but when i went up to the room again , wifi lost signal again , spent half the night in reception trying to fix it .
0	second night there was noise in the halls and noise from car_park / streets , therefore that was another night with hardly_any sleep .
0	only stayed there 0 nights .
0	also tried_contacting customer_services and when i eventually got through to them they were no help at all .
0	if you are staying in glasgow i would not recommend premier_inn .

0	i recently_purchased 0 tickets for cheryl cole at newcastle '_s metro radio arena in october .
0	i struggled to find last_minute tickets with a good view .
0	the only tickets i could_find were right at the back of the arena , until i discovered double0tickets . com !
0	i found tickets last_minute within a few_days of the gig at an incredible low price !
0	i was amazed at how cheap they were , considering the seating was very close to the stage !
0	i grabbed the tickets and within 00_hours i had the tickets at my door !
0	i was very impressed with the customer service on the telephone when i spoke to a female to confirm the seating .
0	i would definately recommend double 0 tickets to anyone who_wants low price tickets last_minute !
0	i was very happy with the seats and overall this made me and my family '_s experience so special !
0	thank_you double 0 !

0	ordered some products online , there was a delay but the customer service team really helped_me get the order quicker and offered real solutions in order for this to happen .
0	i will order again from this company and what an overall experience this has_been , big_shout to jenny in customer_services for going above and beyond my expectations .
0	good service although some of the hotels like bewleys could be quicker at nighttime , last time was waiting 00_mins or so , and this is the last thing you want to do when coming home

0	out of all the companies i '_ve_used for domain registrations 000 - reg is always the company i recommend to friends and family .
0	they ' re fair in their pricing , their support and live_chat system is great and they ' re always helpful and friendly .
0	in the 0 or so years i '_ve_used them i '_ve never had a problem .
0	000 - reg all the way !
0	trustpilot a blatently allowing the online_homebrew company to abuse this service and mislead customers .
0	this renders trustpilot completely pointless .
0	went intore to buy a tv .
0	none in stock but ordered in for only 0 days_later and over the xmas sales period too !
0	great deal , great warranty and great service from the staff at jl chester .
0	i placed my order for a few beer_kits and a fermenting barrel with a tap on the 00th_september .
0	at that time one of the kits was out of stock , due in on the 0th_october .
0	this was acceptable and i proceded .
0	over the next four weeks all the items in my order were in and out of stock and nothing was recieved .
0	despite my communication requesting the change of an item to one in stock , nothing was sent .
0	other communications made took 0 and 0 days to be responded to to try and find out what was going on .
0	after over four weeks ( 00 / 00 ) i recieved half my order which included the fermenting barrel but with no tap and a note saying the tap would follow .
0	nearly another week past and i recieved the rest of my order , still no tap .
0	today over 0_weeks_later ( 00 / 00 ) i have still not recieved the tap despite_being assured that four have now been sent .
0	i have no_problems with any post from any other company .
0	i requested a refund via post around two_weeks_ago and was told one last attempt would be made to ship a tap .
0	still nothing .
0	i again have requested a refund which i am not confident of recieving .
0	terrible delivery .
0	terrible customer service .
0	terrible communication .
0	i should have known not to trust a company with no phone contact .
0	i will be taking my custom to my local homebrew shop from now on .
0	it '_s more_expensive but at_least i wont encounter the problems mentioned and will actually recieve what i have paid for .
0	update ( 00 / 00 ): still no tap recieved as expected .
0	still no refund recieved .
0	only response when trying to contact them is that my refund request ' has_been passed to the appropriate person '.
0	i have had this response twice .
0	how long can it possibly take to process a refund ??
0	absolutely pathetic service .
0	update ( 00 / 00 ): still no refund .
0	still no response other than ' your request has_been passed_onto the appropriate person '.
0	00 weeks tomorrow since i placed my order .
0	great selection , discount prices , fast shipping , free_samples .
0	can '_t be beat !
0	after looking around for a while i finally decided to go with glassescorp as i had read some good reviews .
0	the price was at the time the best by quite a bit !
0	i ordered them and they arrived the following_day packaged extremely well no chance of them getting broken in the post ..!
0	they also sent out a complimentary lollipop which is always a nice_touch .
0	i would defiantly recommended glassescorp to friends and family
0	to the organiser of a stag trip .
0	go with these_guys to prague .
0	best trip ever we went cheap but ended_up taking out money and doing gun shooting and go_karting which mike and irina organised over there .
0	pissup organised everything well .
0	we had the basic package and it it was brilliant , mike took us to all the best places .
0	we stayed at hotel city_centre firendly , nice rooms and in the middle of everything .
0	cheap , firendly , good customer serivce and good memories .
0	thank_you .

0	thanks toolstop !
0	i was a little_skeptical at first paying a company to unlock my iphone and after putting my details into there website i changed my mind , shortly_afterwards i received an email with a link to plenty of genuine positive_reviews for me to look through and another email offering me £_00 off the unlock price so i decided to go with it and i '_m glad i did , i placed my order on thursday and it '_s now monday and my phone is unlocked so in total took only 0 days as they said that weekends don_'_t count , i will be recommending this site to anyone that asks me where to get an iphone_unlocked when it seems like too much_trouble for their own carrier to do it for them , highly_recommended
0	thanks
0	i recently_purchased a dewalt 000 mitre_saw and leg stand , i wanted saturday delivery which they threw in foc , but they did it by giving me a further 0 %_discount , which saved me another £_00 pound , so i purchased a new level and hammer that they didn_'_t have in stock , they kept me updated_regularly and the items turned_up a few_days_later , with no extra_charge for delivery .
0	i would realy recommend giving them a try !
0	after lots of research_into an a0_printer / scanner /_copier , i came to the conclusion out of the limited options_available that i was going to get a brother .
0	after the usual internet_search printer land came back as the cheapest .
0	i called them to discuss my needs and they agreed that the printer sounded_like a good option for my needs .
0	i ordered the printer at 0 . 00pm and i received it at 00 . 00am the next_morning .
0	i have since made several orders for ink and have received the same excellent service and value for money .
0	i cannot recommend the company highly_enough .
0	site construction solutions_ltd
0	cjs always treat you as a friend through their customer service and their prices are unbeatable .
0	they respond promptly , even through their facebook_page and deserve to be recognized as one of the , if not the best , top online digital retailer out of all others , including steam and origin .
0	i have bought multiple things from them in the past and i have never had a problem with them .
0	according to mazuma my fone was blacklisted just took it into vodafone and they checked on the national database and they said phone is not blacklisted and gave_me more than i was offered by mazuma for a non - working samsung_jet .
0	i will never use this website again !
0	cheapest place i found for 0d tickets and delivered in plenty of time before the concert .
0	highly_recommend double0
0	i purchased an epson lx0000 printer from printerland as it was the best price i found online .
0	printer arrived swiftly and well_packaged .
0	no_problems at all .
0	customer service was very helpful when i contacted them with a query .
0	would highly_reccommend .

0	i love you .
0	marry me .
0	all of you .
0	then pay for the heart bypass surgery .
0	i don_'_t know - maybe it '_s just me - but any xbox game i order seems to spin and not run - due to the ' lovefilm ' sticker on the middle - maybe rethink this .
0	i purchased some shoes online for my girlfriend '_s birthday , a pair of nice red high heels - when the package arrived ( very quickly , i might_add ) it seemed a little too large for just a pair of high heels - upon getting it home , i double_checked the contents , and to my amazement and horror - wrong shoes - instead , i had a pair of ( admittedly cool looking ) wellies .
0	uh - oh .
0	however , after a quick e_- mail to the care department , i was straight in contact with louise and sarah , who , i have to say were bloody fantastic , and an_absolute credit to the company .
0	they were understanding , incredibly efficient , and were straight onto sorting_out the issue .
0	they said they ' d do what they could , and within 0 minutes flat , they ' d called me back , having_spoken to the shoe supplier , and the new shoes were being boxed up and sent via first_class special delivery .
0	those shoes arrived just now - less_than 00hours after i first reported the problem .
0	as a good will gesture , they also said i could keep the wellies and give them to my girlfriend too , rather_than send them back .
0	now normally , with an error like this , it ' d mean less stars on a review - but the way this was handled !?
0	you guys deserve nothing less_than 0 .
0	great customer service like this is rare_these days , and friendly , helpful staff like sarah and louise are a rare breed .
0	you guys are absolutely awesome .
0	thank_you so much for all your help .
0	cheers

0	stay_away from these !
0	i ordered a jacket from their website on a sunday , they said it would arrive with me on the following friday in time for my camping_trip .
0	the jacket i received on the friday was completely the wrong jacket ( a woman '_s , small jacket - i am a man ).
0	when i rang up they offered me another jacket with a different brand which i did not want so they offered me a refund but only when they collected the woman '_s jacket .
0	i managed to find this jacket else where , but as a result of the late refund , couldn_'_t buy it as i didn_'_t have the money .
0	ellis_brigham could have refunded me there and then and i wouldn_'_t have suffered on my trip .
0	awful company .
0	awful staff .
0	stay_away from these , they are not worthy of your money
0	all information about the hostel was relevant and accurate .
0	no booking_fees is very good too .
0	nice attractive website , nice usability and easy to navigate around .
0	nice and simple to search for a hostel in a certain city .
0	0_stars !
0	i '_ve had great customer service , as well as found great prices on all the products i normally buy .
0	nice work !
0	the free products seem great but if you put them in and then check with the shipping it will add $ 0 . 00 or 00 cents for the " free " item .
0	do you really think a sample_pack ( 0 pills ) really costs anything when shipping 0 lbs of protein or 00 lbs of drinks ?
0	bull .
0	the 0 %_off competitors preices is nice if you have all day to commpare every_single product . believe it or not i like the site ok but even when i inquired_about how a free_sample really costs money they send back an almost pissed_off response about how cheap all their stuff is and how it really costs and other nonesense .
0	also i have had trouble with shipping and even just paying for the orders .
0	it seems like an amazing site but just be wary and check it out for yourself .
0	i know they have to make money but i know for a fact the expired stuff is pure profit and the shipping charges are the real shot in the dark .
0	used sportsbike_shop again and once again received brilliant service .
0	there was a little mishap at the checkout where it didn_'_t take money off when using a voucher_code but this was quickly and efficiently dealt_with by the customer_services team .
0	items arrived quicker_than_expected , ordered tuesday and arrived wednesday .
0	remarkable .
0	well_packaged , great service .
0	keep it up !
0	the fitter rang and told me he was going to be a bit late but kept me informed and up to date which was good .
0	when he arrived he was well manners and great to talk to , we talked while he carried_out the tyre_fitting and he even saved me £_00 by showing me that my tracking didn_'_t need doing .
0	overall a very pleasant_experience from grippy and i will be using them and recommending to friend in the future .
0	a very straight_forward website makes it easy to order lamps at reasonable prices .
0	even_though there are minimum order quantities , their prices mean that you get the item you want at a good price , plus spares .
0	to allow quicker delivery , i was contacted with an_alternative item suggestion .
0	they were polite and very helpful .
0	the items were dispatched quickly and arrived on the day i was told , exceedingly well_wrapped .
0	i would definitively use again for my lighting needs .
0	lampshop_online was a very good retailer suggestion from amazon . co . uk and work very well with their courier fedex .
0	a 0_star thumbs_up to both of them .
0	was recommended to parcel0go by a buyer on ebay as was limited to buyer collect only for larger items .
0	parcel0go has allowed_me to extend my delivery options to the whole of the uk .
0	their website is very easy to get quotes for and will tie all your orders together if you use the same email address and do not create an account at first , as i did .
0	there prices are competative and allow you to goes from a wide_range of dispatch methods varying on speed and cost .
0	i have only had one issue which related to not being_able to edit my registered email address , but their livechat service is very good and helpful .
0	i was assisted by craig who '_s messages came_across friendly and polite , which is not an easy task when only using text based communication .
0	as services go , parcel0go is very useful and from my experience , they have the back - up customer_support to go with it .
0	i have been using hostelbookers for quite some time for my travel solutions when it comes to accommodation .
0	i love how i get instant_replies with regards to bookings .
0	also , the site is more like what you see is what you get .
0	last_year when i confirmed some bookings for vietnam , hostelbookers wrote to me a couple of days_later stating that they had received negative_feedback for the hotel i booked so they refunded the entire money and asked me to book an_alternate hotel .
0	good jobs guys for going the extra_mile to ensure that your guests are happy .
0	cheers .
0	just ordered a printer and subsequently a tonor from these_guys - absolutely_faultless !
0	great price , quick delivery and superb product , what more could you ask for ?
0	!
0	after an accident at work i contacted aah , who fully helped_me with my claim , relieving extra stress from my situation .
0	staff were extremely professional throughout , and i ' d thoroughly_recommend to anyone who has had / will have a similar_situation in the past or in the future .
0	pretty safe_bet in you want good advice and well prices supplements .
0	they have a great selection of products at even better prices ( shame about the uk tax !).
0	always quick to receive my orders from them .
0	i would recommend .
0	i have ordered from them many_times .
0	only time i don_'_t order with them is when i need a product they don_'_t sell .
0	when you use other_places you realise how great these_guys really are .
0	good prices , very quick delivery and clear communication .
0	keep_up the good work .
0	every time i have used this company there has_been a problem .
0	0st time i ordered 0 things .
0	0 days_later i had not received anything .
0	i had to ring up and contact them to find 0 of the 0 things were out of stock .
0	so i said they could send the one product they did have .
0	they then send me the wrong product .
0	i then had to return it before waiting for them to send the right product .
0	they offered my 0 %_off my next order .
0	when i tried to use this , the code they gave did did not work .
0	says everything .
0	i was then stupid enough to order yet again from them .
0	0 days_later , no email of the product being sent out , and 00 attempts at calling them have gone_unanswered .
0	avoid !!
0	!
0	superb prices for great products , will order again .
0	yet another top service by hifi_headphones , quality product delivered next_day .
0	thank_you !!
0	!
0	top kex without top prices !
0	!
0	i just started_using supplement wearhouse .
0	i think depending on where u live the shipping can get a little_pricy but the products are really cheap for the brands you want .
0	plus they give you a free_gift .
0	and its only a few dollars difference from other website .
0	its great !
0	onlinekeystore is a fantastic website that does_exactly_what its designed to do .
0	it gets you keys for games quickly and easily , using an easily_accessible and usable website that makes the overall shopping_experience a pleasure .
0	highly_recommended .
0	just to start off , i only selected 0_star because you had to choose , otherwise it would be - 00 ..
0	if only i would of read_reviews of talktalk before i decided to go into a contract with them .
0	originally joined them about 0 and a half years_ago with just internet and phone at my old address , while with them it was fine , the bill was never what we agreed to pay but we guessed it '_s probably like that with most companies .
0	we recently decided to move house and when i contacted talktalk i realised they had forget to mention to me that the 0 year contract was up 0 months previous but they had put me on a rolling_contract .
0	after i rang them i told the guy on the phone that i actually was going to move to sky as we wanted the tv_channels etc .
0	i was told that the talktalk box was as good as sky and that i could get the sky channels for a little extra each_month , i was also promised hundreds of on demand movies and the ability to pause and rewind live tv , after waiting 0_weeks to get the package confirmed because twice talktalk had made mistakes while ordering the equipment etc ( should have know then ) i told them to cancel the contract i had decided to leave but they promised it would be easier if i stayed with them instead of having to move from one to the other .
0	when we moved and received the talktalk box i realised i had been swindled ..
0	the channels took about 0 / 00 seconds to change on a good day .. but most of the time would take about 0 - 0 minutes to change occasionally crashing and having to be completely restarted !
0	as well as this you could only record the talktalk channels and not the usual digital channels , each months bill was massively over priced what we expected and if you paused something and came back an_hour later it would just skip back to the live playing .
0	i contacted talktalk after 0 months of this poop and they where completely cooperative saying they understand it was their mistake , they will cancel my contract without having to incur any early cancellation_fees , they would send me a bag and all i had to do was send them their tv box .
0	it was great , i found an amazing deal with sky !
0	i mean literally all the tv_programmes , movies , sports , unlimited_internet , phone etc for about £_00 per_month !
0	but then a few weeks_later i received a bill for about £_000 . 00 from talktalk .
0	i rang up to dispute this and they said they had made a mistake and they would wipe the debt , however they could only wipe £_000 . 00 of it because £_000 . 00 of it was for the cost of the talktalk box although i still hadn_'_t received the bag to send the box back in the post .
0	they said they would send one out straight_away .
0	a few weeks_later i received a reminder from talktalk that if i didn_'_t pay them their money which had gone up from the original debt , they would pass me on to debt collections .
0	i rang straight_away and said how dare they threaten me when its their problem , they apologised a lot said they made a note on the account and then told me they would send out another bag and that they made a note on the account .
0	i then received the bag in the post and at the same time i received a final reminder saying that they had not received the payment and if they don_'_t within the next few_days they would pass the account onto debt_collectors , i rang talktalk furious saying i had only just received the bag and that i was planning to send the item out that day , they said that '_s fine as long as they receive it i will be okay , the guy on the phone even told me he would personally ring me back on friday which was about 0 days_later , and that he had made a note on the account .
0	on friday i had no phone_call , however i did receive a letter from a debt collecting agency saying that my account had been passed_onto them and that talktalk want their money .
0	i rang talktalk today and the guy said they had still not received the box but he would ring me when they do .. he said talktalk don_'_t have an email address for me to contact them but i told_him i refuse to ring them again .
0	i doubt they actually do write a note on the account , it seems like people on here have mutual feeling about talktalk .
0	i am absolutely furious , this has caused me stress , i have spent so much money ringing them up and being on hold , one time for 00_minutes !!!
0	and my ordeal isn_'_t even over yet !
0	avoid talktalk !
0	!
0	the football_manager 00 game is brilliant .
0	started with the famous glasgow rangers in the scottish league 0 , i have guided them to two scottish challenge cups , 0 scottish cup win and 0 scottish cup runner - up !
0	i found your site the most affordable so thanks a lot !
0	my order arrived on time as expected .
0	and the selection is quite good , i must_confess i got surprised with the real result , looks way better_than the pictures online .
0	thank_you
0	lambda - tek sent out the shipment with ups the same day as the order and it arrived two_days_later :)
0	the shipping is a little expensive if you are just buying something for 0 € but else the site works great .
0	i have sent a lot of parcels with parcel 0 go for pleasure and business and always find the service to be brilliant .
0	they are always , fast at responding and efficient .
0	a recent issue i had catherine sorted for me and was brilliant , if everybody was like her the world would be a better place .
0	i have no_problems in recommending parcel 0 go to anybody looking for a courier .
0	this site is by far the best i have ever_seen .
0	i '_ve researched for the past week and still could not find a better site to purchase supplements .
0	i will_continue to buy my supplements from supplementwarehouse . com from now on !
0	i am so amazed with the amount of items i bought and the price i paid .
0	you definitely have to take_advantage of all the free_samples and other discounted prices !
0	a ++ for sw
0	i have used hostelbookers on several_occasions now and never had a problem with a booking .
0	its also a bonus not paying any booking_fees .
0	compromise with deadline , efficiency , great consumer support and much more , are the reasons_why i am always ordering from digitalrev .
0	you are awesome !
0	thank_you very much for all .
0	kind_regards ,
0	f
0	great email communication on the status of my order , well_packaged and labelled and the delivery was extremely fast .
0	wouldn_'_t hesitate to recommend .
0	i had a very pleasant_experience dealing_with the londonmagic store .
0	there was a problem with one of the items they shipped to me and the issue was resolved very timeously and professionally .
0	an excellent company to work with .
0	i just booked my honeymoon with the help of daniel .
0	he was extremely_helpful and made excellent recommendations and suggestions .
0	the whole_process from initial_enquiry to booking was seamless .
0	now we can '_t wait to go on the honeymoon !
0	!
0	i ordered some pandora_charms 0_weeks_ago .
0	they never arrived and i have contacted achica twice to ask for an update .
0	the excuse provided was : unfortunately due to the volume of goods physically received the distribution_centre are slightly behind in despatching the orders .
0	surely this is not a valid_reason ?
0	if you know how many orders you have , you get the necessary staff in to despatch them .
0	this is what any proper company would do !!
0	and , to make_matters_worse , i have still not received my order .
0	i recently was looking for a new drum_kit and found myself drawn to gak - they do good prices for complete drum_kits , but are slightly more_expensive for tom - heads .
0	however , they are very good for individual drum_heads .
0	i would definitely recommend them !
0	imdb provides everything factual about any movie anywhere on the planet .
0	it '_s so easy to use , and makes looking for information about an actor or actress in a movie as easy as pie !
0	i don_'_t use it that often , simply because i don_'_t watch movies that often , but when i do i '_ve found it undoubtedly useful .
0	i enjoy using skype , but it sometimes feels_like it isn_'_t integrated into my computer system well enough .
0	it often feels_like an outskirt of a program .
0	however , it does provide easy free video calls or video and provides cheap calls from computer to mobile .
0	ebay is one of my all time favorite sites !
0	the build of the website is smooth , professional and easy to use once you get used to it .
0	bear in mind the content is dependent on the people that use it , so don_'_t expect the same every time you search for something to buy .
0	expect a slightly lengthy set - up for you account ( 00 - 00_minutes ), but don_'_t be put off because it '_s more than worth it and doesn_'_t require any effort to maintain .
0	paypal is also used in combination to ebay making it a primary_source for birthday_presents .
0	no matter what it is i '_m searching , google is never far away !
0	i find google really easy to use , its got many different ' apps ' attached to it , for example maps , url shortener , images etc .
0	as a search_engine it '_s brilliant - it also allows other programs to feed in to it , for example internet security such as avg support it .
0	and it '_s a friendly face when in the need to search for something .
0	nothing beats being_able to buy something online without_worrying_about whether the bank details are safe or whether the site i '_m using is genuine .
0	because paypal is independent to to the websites you visit , it makes it perfect if you ' re not sure if you want to trust the site you ' re going to with your bank details !
0	it keeps them safe in virtual high security and is a joy to use .
0	mazuma was really easy to use , i wasn_'_t sure how much i ' d get from my phone considering it was old and not in very good condition at all , but amazingly it sold for a really good price - £_00 for an old_nokia_0000 classic :) would have been £_00 even if it wasn_'_t working !
0	worthwhile , it didn_'_t take long either ... just make_sure you know what phone you '_ve got !
0	don_'_t use wren , this was the 0nd mistake and the worker i hired to fix the wardrobes charged me extra for having to use his own !
0	wren conveniently just apologised , sent me screws after the installation and then responded that we were not in the wrong and as a company we don_'_t offer compensation .
0	pathetic response and truly reflects the 0rd class service they offer .
0	i sincerely say to future customers , don_'_t use them and go to a competitor who will offer a service and a quality product !
0	no_complaints , fast service , easy application , fast payout !!!
0	brilliant loan company .
0	first time using cjs , however very impressed with the service .
0	the autokey delivery system worked great and i had my key in seconds .
0	almost £_00 less_than retail too !
0	will buy from again .
0	my first purchase was fast , and easy , product was much_cheaper then on any other website .
0	supplement_warehouse has the best price on most of the supplements i '_m looking for .
0	this is my first time ordering so i haven_'_t received my things yet , so i don_'_t know how quick they are .
0	i will get back to this
0	game arrived day before release , perfect .
0	always one of , if not the , cheapest price online .
0	i had to cancel some orders with them recently due to finding an offer elsewhere and they obliged no questions_asked as well as refunding me the difference when their price went down on a couple of pre_- orders i ' d already paid for .
0	they even allowed_me to combine 0 separate_orders to save on the postage when i realised it was free delivery for orders over £_00 and that was despite the 0 orders being for games that were being released on separate days and hence delivered separately .
0	absolutely unfaultable
0	no fees !
0	everything was perfect .
0	very fast to book , good search_engine and helpful reviews !
0	recommended .
0	the vast_majority of the orders i have made with asos have arrived early , all in great condition .
0	one the occasions i have had to return items there have never been any_issues ; when a package went missing from a secure place outside my property , they even refunded me the amount and gave_me discount on my next order .
0	i preferentially shop with asos over high_street retailers because i am so happy with the service .
0	supplement_warehouse is an awesome place to buy supplements .
0	it '_s cheaper_than the stores in town and reliable .
0	i have ordered with them a few_times and they always deliver .
0	i haven_'_t had any_problems with them .
0	they also have amazing deals going on all the time .
0	i had a few issues with my account and anna from id called me and with in minutes of being on the phone it was all sorted .
0	very good customer service will always use ironmongery_direct for my supply '_s .
0	bought products from lyco direct were sent by fed - ex next_day arrived at 00 . 00 next_morning .
0	the box was a bit bashed but the sender had packed the items well so no_problems there .
0	is the first time i have used fed - ex and sadly the last judging_by the reviews .
0	was a good fast service though
0	bought some stuff from a trade supplier forgetting that they use parcel_force , paid £_00 . 00 for am delivery for today .
0	items were dispatched on tuesday 00st they were collected by parcel_force as normal checked track and trace because today is the day for delivery and turns_out my stuff is in belfast how can it get on a plane and to a different country without_any one spotting the mistake .
0	at 00 . 00_hours there still in belfast
0	do not use parcel_force please
0	fast delivery , good quality :)
0	i have bought washing maschine as in stock and i paid for next_day delivery after that ive been waiting 0_weeks for delivery
0	very rude customer service
0	i will never use apliances direct again
0	plenty of stock in a fairly rare size tyre , including a range of quality to cheaper options , therefore prices ranging_from roughly_£_000 all the way down to £_00 !
0	very user_friendly site , and my order came within 0 day on standard delivery .
0	do not get your tyres anywhere_else as its impossible to get better customer service , and choice !
0	stay clear away from this " company ", it is the biggest ripoff i have ever come_across and wasn_'_t able to do anything about it !
0	these reviews on trustpilot are soooo not reliable and i assume they are fake , after my bad_experience with doyouspain . com i checked tripadvisor . com and read all the horror oboe things about them , i wish i had read them ...
0	my experience :
0	ripoff no . 0 :
0	i rented a car in gran_canaria which supposed to cost 00 £ roughly according to their website , i received emails quick witch confirmations etc .
0	they kept sending me mails about " insurance ", to buy it through doyouspain . com for like 00 - 00 £ otherwise i ' d be paying around 00 € at the airport in gran_canaria .
0	i thought to myself , i do not need an insurance .
0	once i got to gran_canaria i was told i have to buy an insurance for 00 € or i pay them 000 € just in case something happens as deposit , 000 € is ridiculous anyway ...
0	i got so upset and said " ok , charge my card 000 € i don_'_t want to pay for insurance ", the lady was obviously not expecting this response and said that debit_cards cannot be charged 000 € and literally forced me to take up the insurance !
0	so i got setback for a super shitty car like vw_polo by 000 € plus the 00 £ i paid already .
0	on to the next thing they ripped me off with .
0	ripoff no . 0 :
0	she then told me that i have to pay for the fuel that is in the car .
0	i suddenly_became i real victim that has no power to do anything about it at the point , i said i don_'_t want the car and the lady threatened me that the 00 £ i paid in initially will be gone for good !
0	so , i got scared that i end up with no car because of the season and overpaid .
0	guess_what they charged me for fuel ....?
0	i had to pay 00 € for fuel which seems to be normal when you ' re from the uk or germany , but i drove the car nuts so i ran_out of the fuel and had to refuel the car .
0	once i got to the patrol station i realized that in gran_canaria 0 liter of fuel_costs like 0 , 00 € or 0 , 00 € which is not as much as the car_rental company charged me .
0	i thought ok , i fuel the car with 00 € and guess_what ...
0	the tank was half full !!!
0	!
0	this was a modern way of riping off people !
0	stay_away from doyouspain . com and goldcar !!!
0	!
0	this is the fifth printer we have had from printerland .
0	each time we have purchased oki printers as the quality seems high and when purchasing through printerland , they offered a 0 year onsite support .
0	we have used this in the past and the service from printerland and oki combined has_been excellent .
0	we did have an issue when purchasing a colour printer that was primarily going to be used for black only printing .
0	we were told that we could set the printer to only ever use black .
0	unfortunately this was not true as the printer primes the colour toners before every use and unnecessarily used up the colour toners .
0	we explained to printerland that this wasn_'_t fit for purpose and with a few emails back and forth , they arranged for a replacement mono printer to be delivered .
0	since then we have purchased 0 more printers from printerland .
0	although toners and accessories can be purchased cheaper_elsewhere , printerland are always happy to match the prices .
0	the customer_services team is attentive and they follow_up every order .
0	the sending of the invoice after delivery is a nice feature , rather_than having to download from the website directly .
0	delivery is swift and free .
0	i wouldn_'_t hesitate in recommending printerland to others .
0	this is a great website to order and booked for tyres .
0	if you book in advance you get around £ 0 off a tyre .
0	really easy to use just need to know your tyre size , dont trust the number_plate option as its not that reliable .
0	this company is the worst to be experienced since a long time :
0	we ordered our internet online .
0	first they did not process the order , as we called they said the account is open now .
0	from then on they charge us double and do not quite doing it .
0	they even lie to us by saying that they won_'_t be doing it .
0	as i can proof it through my bank state i am on a quite certain side .
0	additionally their service people never any clue about our package or any service we have ordered .
0	not only is an amount charged double but also the wrong amount ( higher ).
0	further they keep on sending us bills we should pay for we have not ordered .
0	let '_s see where this is leading to .
0	maybe a lawyer would help getting heard .
0	just annoying this company !
0	my recommendation : stay_away from talk_talk , you will regret signing_up !
0	i was looking for a nice card folder themed to the latest m00 magic series , after a search on google i found one that i loved .
0	i ordered it on a wednesday_evening and it arrived friday_afternoon .
0	wonderful service and excellent quality .
0	extremely polite , nice staff , great service and are very helpful .
0	installed everything i needed on my dedi server .
0	showed me how to use everything and how to set things up .
0	i got the server on the same day i ordered it .
0	i would recommend this company to anyone .
0	its a pleasure to be of their custom .
0	i love supplement_warehouse and will be using them for all of my supplement purchases .
0	the prices are the cheapest i have ever_seen online and they have wonderful products .
0	i found my whey_protein on here for half of the price of the local gnc by my house .
0	i think it is great how they also give free_sample_packs of products on their site for you to try out .
0	their sales are also great , i got a couple t shirts from their site that cost $ 0 . 00 and i will be wearing to the gym and showing to my friends to recomend them !!
0	!
0	the service provided met_expectations .
0	the order came through quickly .
0	i had a technical issue which was addressed within_00hrs .
0	so would definitely use this company again .
0	hadn_'_t used these_guys before but they were the cheapest by a wide margin on the solomon quest 0d boots i ' d promised myself for a very long time .
0	wasn_'_t disappointed , got them on the third working day from ordering , just over a week before_christmas .
0	top service and highly_recommended !
0	we '_ve bought twice from oak_furniture_land twice_now , and both_times we '_ve been left flabbergasted .
0	imagine a company that sold good quality , well_designed furniture .
0	now imagine that it was well priced , and kept in stock for quick delivery .
0	now image they had a good sales force who weren_'_t pushy , and a well_designed and easy to use website .
0	madness .
0	now on top of all that imagine they went and done something crazy .
0	like what they said they would , when they said they would .
0	what ?
0	this is britain , right ?
0	0000 ?
0	bonkers .
0	oak_furniture_land promise to get in touch to let you know when they will deliver your furniture .
0	they do .
0	they give you an exact day .
0	they stick to it .
0	they then say they will let you know a few_days before what time window ( down to 0 hours ) they will deliver it in .
0	they do that too .
0	then they say they will phone when they are 00_minutes away .
0	yep , you guessed it - they do that too .
0	then they make outlandish promises about putting the delivery in whatever room you want .
0	they only go and do that too .
0	final polish , is when you sign for it , you are not signing the condition of the delivery off - only that you have received it , and they delivery guys haven_'_t taken chunks out of your walls getting it in the door .
0	you get 00_hours to pop it out its packaging and look it over - and they give you the customer service card to use if you have any dramas .
0	in both deliveries ( of 0 dining_table , 0 chairs , 0 giant mirror and 0 chunky sideboard ) we '_ve had 0 issues .
0	0 complaints .
0	and of all the promises they '_ve made - they '_ve kept everyone .
0	i genuinely recommend them to everyone , including you !
0	fast and reliable
0	really really impressed with speckyfoureyes . com .
0	excellent value for money .
0	excellent value for money , reasonable shipping_costs , fast devilvery
0	people need to understand how to use ryanair and quit complaing .
0	if you want to spend £_000_quid on a ticket each go and do it , no one is stopping you .
0	people who dont_think pay too much !
0	hand_luggage only for a one week stay ( what more do you need ), go to the postoffice and get a pre_- paid card for nothing , hunt_around for the best deals and fly cheap .
0	the planes are new , the fleet has one of the best timing figures etc in the business .
0	yes some flights are late , but last time i paid £_000 to fly with ba i was 0 hours late .
0	that is transport !
0	if you want to take a family away in the school_holidays , loads of luggage , tons of bags at the airport and forget to check in online it might cost you a lot more - but compare it to the normal airlines charges and it is still not that expense .
0	it depends on how well you can read the terms and conditions and apply them to your needs .
0	i have had 00 flights in two years with this company and each one has_been ontime ( maybe a few minutes late ) very cheap and excellent service .
0	im a lover of weekends away so i book weeks in advance , travel with hand_luggage and spend my money and energy on enjoying the city i am visiting rather_than finiding a negative with the airline .
0	if you are paying 00 quid for a return flight to have a fantastic weekend then who_cares !
0	if you are a family of 0 , taking a 0 week vacation , booked last_minute , with extra suticase , turn_up at the airport with too much luggage then yes , they become expensive but the key is understanding who and what the service provided is for !
0	i have used just eat many a time as it '_s easier for me to pay by card rather_than cash .
0	everytime i order through the website it takes the double the time if i call and pay by cash .
0	today i ordered through the website and on confirmation it said for collection .
0	why would i order and pay an extra_charge to order through a website for collection .
0	i then had to ring the takeaway place who said they are delivering the order and to ignore just eat as they had asked them to get this sorted many_times .
0	why should i order through this website and pay the charge if i then have to call direct anyway .
0	i might as well give that extra little_bit of money to the company .
0	its clear just eat are out for there profit only and dont care about the bad light they put the takeaway services they represent in .
0	wont be using again - would far rather pay the high prices for deliverence with much_better service levels if i find myself in a cashless situation again .
0	just started_using this service as always in the past thoght the new late fees etc was too good to be true .
0	have found the helpful and true to there word and is a really simple , fast easy service to use .
0	very impressed
0	there was 00 of us that went on our stag_do and everything_went really well .
0	being in charge it was alot_easier to let another company worry_about paying for everything and all the guys just had to pay them direct , if we had done it ourseleves and paid for everything up front we wouldnt of been able to do half the stuff .
0	the hotel was good for us , we asked for budget to keep the costs down but it was still quad rooms not dorms and there was an on site bar which we didnt_expect to .
0	the half day paintball and mud buggy driving were wicked and everyone had a laugh , plus we got extra paintballs than we were originaly told which was a bonus .
0	nightclubs , casino and strip club were all the goodl , que jump and dint have to pay entry on the night which was good as kept our whip entierly for the beer fund .
0	have got another one with release in the summer which we booked with the voucher they gave_us for using them again so hopefully that goes just as well .
0	i booked a city_link service .
0	they came within a few hours to collect it and it was delivered the next_day with no_problems .
0	nice and simple !
0	highly_recommend !
0	i '_ve_used travel_republic a number of time now and always had a good experience .
0	very easy to use site , with great prices .
0	while the champagne is fine , the courier managed to deliver to the wrong house .
0	well i say delivered , that is if being chucked outside the wrong house in the rain .
0	customer service is dyer - " its the time of year " and " the courier has to deliver them " - er well try the correct house and maybe that would happen .
0	absolutely_useless !
0	use at your own_peril f - 0 / 0
0	ordered a game off of them due to it being cheaper_than any downloading services alternative !
0	was quick and painless .
0	the extra security via_text was also very nice to see .
0	would recommend .
0	so , naturally , as a couple bearing the weight of american student loans , working in china and resting in bangkok , we find the cheapest guesthouse possible in bangkok through hostelbookers . com , and find our experience there not only to be affordable , especially with that extra ten_percent on credit ... but also the best community experience in thailand , trumping our last visit four years_ago !
0	we are musicians , so immediately falling in love with the musical atmosphere ( amps , guitars and drum set provided !
0	), and surrounded with fellow backpacking artists alike from around the world , we feel like we ' re in heaven , enough to make a hard bed feel like a victoria mattress on a kang bed !
0	the neighborhood ( far from the western backpacking frenzy and empire of khao san ) was fantastic , with tons of popular local street food and markets surrounding the area .
0	the bus was easily_accessible , and connected directly to the mrt train just a few minutes away !
0	the owner of the overtay ( the name of the guesthouse ) was also super friendly , intelligent and very cultured .
0	he set_up a projection screen for all the guests on some nights , and we all watched hilarious , independent comedy flicks !
0	we didn_'_t realize just how much fun we would have by booking a night in an unknown space with our american credit_card !
0	i have bought from chemicals0research . com for a long while now and have yet to be disappointed .
0	the service is always prompt , professional and well communicated .
0	the range of products is amazing and are progressively expanding , much to my wallets unhappiness !
0	the item i like the most is 0 - apb powder and it was exactly_what i wanted and expected .
0	the quality is excellent and consistent .
0	i '_ve tried this in both the powder and pellet form .
0	a rc company unlike others with quality reassurance , quick deliveries and unrivalled prices chemicals0research . com .
0	should be the only choice for any research chemist or science enthusiast .
0	brilliant service , helping_me prove friends and family wrong since day one !
0	i started_using asda online after getting many many incorrect orders from tesco and countless replacements for everyday items that were unavailable !
0	great service , especially for someone like me that can '_t stand the crowds and queues !
0	i was pointed in the direction of trustpilot via a friend who suggested i do a bit of digging about a company i was about to use for something and decided to add my two pence about other_companies and services i have used , great great site , just have to take everything with a pinch of salt as everyone has they ' re own experience !
0	i love using amazon , the wish_list feature is a real_gem , easy to pick what i like and then i can go back to it or pass it onto my friends and family at christmas !
0	love it !
0	sara was truly_amazing , we visited 0 times over the weekend ... after this being where i got my fiancées engagement_ring we went back for our_wedding_bands & the help we received was truly_outstanding ...
0	i would recommend to anyone after great jewellery & service ...
0	tried to recycle phone elsewhere , to no_avail , used envirophone & they do exactly_what it says on the tin ... others out there may offer more , but if you want the best deal & service use envirophone ...
0	a0 service , envirophone took_forever bt mazuma , better_than_expected & would use them first nxt time without a shadow of a doubt ...
0	very very expensive service .
0	not even up to the standards
0	ordered on a thursday before the next_day delivery cut_off , unfortunately they didnt manage to do it in time ( it happens !)
0	but was emailed saying the delay and if i would accept the saturday delivery instead ( paid for by them ), unfortunately the packer didnt send it via this so i got it on monday but really quick responses from these_guys , gave_me a refund on my delivery cost which tbh is good for me .
0	i wasnt in a huge rush so i appreciate them giving me a refund when they really didnt need to !.
0	excellent company , as i always say .. you only truly know how good or bad a company is when something_goes_wrong , hifi delivered on correcting this :).
0	will be buying from them again !.
0	no problem with the service i product i received .
0	brilliant .
0	really simple and easy to follow instruction .
0	money went in the bank same day as they recieved the phone which was a couple of days .
0	just a great service .
0	there help was really good and quick , thanks for your help
0	the staff are always extremely_helpful and welcoming .
0	also very knowledable about what they do , but manage to be so that they don_'_t make you feel inferior .
0	bought my first electric from here and plan to continue doing so for the forseeable_future .
0	i ordered a sapphire 0000 graphics_card and paid for 0 - 0 day postage .
0	it came on the 0rd working day , very well_packaged and i am very happy !
0	i just built a server and ordered all the parts from ocuk .
0	everything arrived next_day and i am very happy .
0	i phoned before placing my wifes order and spoke to ant , very good customer service .
0	order placed wed , phone arrived fri . no issues at all .
0	planning on setting_up a contract for myself with them asap .
0	dabs seem to be getting bad_press but i dont see why ..
0	i have just ordered a draytek_router and it came in 0 working_days .
0	before that a radeon hd 0000 and that was next_day .
0	i will use this company again .
0	very good service .
0	used this site for years .
0	always fast and reliable with helpful customer service if required .
0	flashbay provided ecuity with a high_quality service right from our initial_inquiry .
0	samples were deliver promptly allowing us to progress to the design stage were time was taken to ensure matched the final product to our brand requirements .
0	production turnaround and delivery were also managed efficiently and professionally with our product delivered on time as promised .
0	best price and the free next_day delivery was bang on .
0	items that were shown as in stock were not , this resulted_in my order sitting in their system not being dispatched .
0	of course noone bothered to tell me this ; only by checking the website myself and having to ring them did i eventually find this out .
0	i think it was well over a week ( possibly two ) until my order did get dispatched which is comical considering their line ' over 00_% orders dispatched same day '.
0	and don_'_t get me started on the ' one - click ' name .
0	however , the items i ordered were great quality and as cheap as i could_find them on the web .
0	personally though , i '_m not sure it was worth the hastle .
0	no_reservations , i would recommend this company to anyone .
0	this is the first time i '_ve tried using them .
0	i thought i would use their price match_promise , quoting another sites product .
0	all they did was cancel my order with them .
0	as i '_ve started keeping discus i '_m currently buying lots of equipment but i won_'_t be using them again .
0	i also just bought the items from their competitor .
0	this is the email they sent me
0	hi stephen ,
0	we have investigated your price match request and unfortunately cannot fulfil it as , although a valid competitors price has_been quoted , it is below our buying in price for the item ( s ).
0	this is unusual but can happen if a competitor is unaware of a recent price increase .
0	in this situation if the competitor has the item ( s ) in stock and will honour their advertised price we would recommend going with them .
0	kind_regards [_name_]
0	the warehouse aquatics team
0	items are very reasonably_priced , speed of delivery was excellent and we '_ll packaged .
0	highly_recommended
0	well what can i say i ordered my new lens ( a tokina_00 - 00mm_f0 . 0 dxii ) from digital_rev sunday_evening , i woke_up to find an email with tracking monday_morning , my lens touched down in gb @ 0 :_00am tuesday and was delivered 0 :_00pm tuesday .
0	what a fantastic service , ty digital_rev
0	by far the best place to purchase supplements from .
0	great prices and great customer service .
0	lots of specials during every order .
0	they have a very user_friendly website and you can book with a low deposit .
0	i only paid £_00 and they were also the cheapest i could_find and believe me i looked around !!
0	can '_t fault them so_far ...
0	i placed an order on a friday and i received my product the next_day !
0	this is outstanding customer service , especially as they offer free delivery !
0	i would highly_recommend using this company .
0	they are also very competitive and i often find that their products are the cheapest around .
0	very happy customer !
0	ordered replacement batteries for my home phones at a very reasonable price , including the delivery charge !.
0	very quick delivery and would definitely order from them again !
0	it was just perfect for finding places to stay while planning my euro trip :)
0	supplementwarehouse . com has everything you need and is cheaper_than anywhere_else .
0	they also have incredibly fast and cheap shipping .
0	been coming to this site for years to get all of my supplements .
0	cheapest prices , vast_selection .
0	again , wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else .
0	hope that the warehouse doesn_'_t go_anywhere anytime_soon .
0	great service , £_00 for my 0 yr_old_nokia , exactly_what it said on the tin !
0	great service , salesman was very helpful and not too pushy at all .
0	dropped £ 0000 from the price of the car before asking and finance sorted_out very quickly .
0	expected to be there for hours and hours but everything wrapped up quickly and car was very clean .
0	waiting for item for a week and asked for a review in between so here it is .
0	no item received no email_saying when it could be delivered .
0	paid £_000 + for trainers that i found slightly_cheaper afterwards with next_day delivery .
0	not happy .
0	had problems with a delivery that the seller had addressed the wrong person .
0	but with help from the live_chat i talked to someone called emma and she managed to help me with the address and redelivery .
0	excellent autokey service and super_fast system
0	i ordered my new system on boxing_day , and even_though it was the holidays , my order arrived just into the new year .
0	its an excellent and well put_together wee machine .
0	i used tshirt_studio because it '_s the top_rated service of its kind on trustpilot .
0	i ordered the t - shirt with express delivery and it was very fast indeed - i received it before 00pm the next_day .
0	however , i had used a custom design for the t - shirt , and because some of the colours came out a bit darker on the t - shirt , a lot of the details in the original image were lost .
0	also , as a result of the image transfer process , the t - shirt looked slightly faded already when it arrived .
0	i would have appreciated some advice on the colours to use in my original image to make_sure it came out exactly how i ' d like .
0	then again , it was a gift to someone and they were thoroughly pleased with the result .
0	i would use them again , but not before trying out other services .
0	i placed my order on 00feb order itself didn_'_t ship until the 00 and now its 0 mar ... and i '_m still_waiting .
0	should have just gone with bodybuilding . com which gets their stuff out here in 0 days tops .
0	the wait on just processing alone should have been the wait time for processing and shipping for $_00 dollar shipping charge ... that is outrageous !
0	i bought a salad from my local asda and when i was about to eat it i found a dead caterpillar inside it .
0	i took picture of it and called the head_office they said i need to give it back to the store and they will give me the refund and investigate and i will be sent a goodwill voucher .
0	when i went to return the salad the lady on the counter served a lady before me who left her pregnancy test strip on the desk , the lady said ohhh she left her dirty strip here then she covered her hand and picked_up the strip to chuck it in the bin and dint even apologize to me before serving me .
0	i called the head_office to see whats_happening with my case and i was told that its registered as a complaint and if i wanted them to investigate then i should have told them , after that they took my details and the manager of the local asda called to say sorry . i sent an email after that but i guess its case dismissed .
0	i bought the 00_%_off get bike deal .
0	i was told that i can book the day anytime and the voucher is valid till jun 0000 , but yesterday i checked my account and it showed £_00 . 00 taken out already and was over drawn so ill be charged on top , even_though i did not call the centre to book my day of training .
0	i sent an email to groupon for refund but no reply yet .
0	great choice
0	great price
0	great service
0	problem started when i asked xln to transfer the broadband from one line to another ( i had 0 phone lines from xln ).
0	instead they ceased one phone line as well as the broadband .
0	i called their customer service and was told that the line was ceased due to a ' system error ' while broadband due to severe_weather_conditions , which i obviously knew was an utter_rubbish .
0	i was told several_times that someone will call me back to resolve the issue , but they never did .
0	i would say i was forced to terminate the contract with xln purely_because of their awful customer service .
0	i have received a letter telling_me that i will have to pay £_000 termination charges .
0	i called their cancellation department and explained the situation and loss of business i suffered due to their incompetencies .
0	i was told that i should have given a written notice after giving xln time period of 00 days to fix the problem .
0	only then i would have been entitled to terminate the contract without paying termination charges .
0	i was a little_nervous_about hiring a lens , but i needn_'_t have been .
0	the whole_process was clearly_explained on their website , and regular_emails usefully kept me up - to - date at each_stage of the process .
0	my lens arrived on time and worked great .
0	i '_m already_planning my next hire , and needless to say i wouldn_'_t hesitate in recommending lenses for hire to anyone_thinking of hiring a lens .
0	i bought ds game on friday_afternoon , arrived next_day in the morning .
0	very impressive .
0	fast dispatch .
0	thankyou .
0	i ordered an iphone 0 online with this company back in september and had to pay £_00 deposit which would come off my 0th bill .
0	i cancelled the contract after a week after orange said they did not know when i ' d receive the phone and i would get my £_00 back within a month .
0	a month had past and still no refund !
0	after spending 0 hours on the phone getting transferred from one department to the next the phone went dead ( lines had closed ) ring again the following_day and was told i would receive my refund in 00 days .
0	00 days_later and still nothing !
0	rang again and told yet again 00 days .
0	it '_s not the end of december and i still have not had a refund .
0	who do they think they are ?
0	if i owed them money they would soon be on my back for it !
0	i have had to result in writing a letter to them threatening_legal_action !
0	like i have nothing better to do with my time that writing letters to them asking for my money back .
0	will never go with orange in the future !
0	the jewellery_quarter in birmingham is rebound for it '_s engagement_rings and has many shops catering to this area .
0	having visited four shops before marlow '_s diamonds i can say with confidence that i would have saved a great deal of time and not suffered nearly as many pushy_salesmen if i had just gone to marlow '_s in the first instance .
0	from the offset it was evident that their clerks knew what they were talking_about , and kindly took the time to fully understand what i was looking for .
0	their selection of high_quality stones is unmatched anywhere_else in the area and their ability to really design and personalise your ring is outstanding .
0	most_importantly , the clerk we dealt_with ( carmen ) was able to make the whole_experience enjoyable and make my fiancée feel very special .
0	i was more than happy with everything i received from marlow '_s and would not_hesitate to recommend them to anyone_else thinking_about popping the questions to that special girl .
0	jason horne
0	great range of options and customisations .

0	the sales_team and owners were extremely_helpful every_step of the way .
0	the price was more than competitive and they were far more professional than previous businesses i ' d dealt_with .
0	steven_james guitars is the best guitar store in the north_east , with great variety of guitars and pedals there '_s not much this store doesn_'_t have !
0	also has great customer service who don_'_t mind how long or many guitars you try out !
0	whether your looking to loose weight , bulk up or anything in between , myprotein offers almost everything you can ask for , or anything i ask for anyway , highly_recommended and constantly used .
0	first place i check when i need something new .
0	great offers and prices with fast delivery .
0	better_than the high_street ...
0	bought from them a couple of times now and the service has_been top_class , packaging is minimal to reduce all over costs in general i imagine but using the express delivery option for an extra 00p has always seen the packages arriving quickly and undamaged .
0	there are no differences to the products compared to buying directly from the manufacturer '_s apart_from the huge_savings .
0	definitely my first stop for supplements .
0	superb service - i feel like i can contact them at any time and that they are pleased to help and they are always polite and professional .
0	i spoke to katie and helped_me when i could not track my parcel so although i had a problem i was still able to get information easily .
0	i always use the live_chat as its convenient and like the service i get from parcel0go .
0	i was actually recommended to you from someone_else and i will also recommend where i can !
0	thanks !
0	i was desperate for a flash card and a new flash , i needed it within a few_days , and it came in two .

0	i an '_t wait to start using this c for business and the odd few games
0	i had the pleasure of dealing_with lisa_bowers , and she could not have done enough for me , we spoke on the phone a few_times which added a personal_touch .
0	i ordered 00 usb '_s for my wedding_photography , i decided to go for the executive type highly stylish and professional in looks .
0	i '_m just delighted with the results .
0	if you are reading this review i highly_recommend flash_bay , i used a chinese company online and lost £_000 prior to using flash_bay .
0	please don_'_t make the same mistake as me .
0	avoid hengdausb a sam site .
0	i ordered a marshall guv ' nor gv - 0 foot_pedal a few_days ago from this company and the price of the item and post and packaging was very decent the paying and ordering of the item was a breeze and they delivered the item on the estimated_date today 00 / 00 /_0000 .
0	item came in pristine_condition and well_packed in bubble_wrap as to prevent and breakages i would recommend using this company and i will do again in the future as they are prompt and realistically_priced not to mention easy to use
0	easy to book , many options_available to many destinations and you can get points for every booking and review .
0	you can change this points into small gifts .
0	fully recommeded !
0	quality product at great price , easy to use website means you can see exactly_what the end_result will be .
0	front and sides of van just as good as the pic of the back that is shown here .
0	sara hayes solved my problem within minutes , very very helpfull .
0	great customer service skills and knowledge .
0	my experience was not good with this company .
0	i sent them my ipad 00gb as my on - line quote was £_000 - boxed , full working order , usb_lead and in my opinion excellent condition as it has had a full cover on from day 0 .
0	when they received my ipad they sent me an offer of £_000 !
0	i checked the website and i found in the time i had sent my ipad they had dramatically dropped the price of the trade in on ipad 0 which is fine , but i found they had rated my ipad in bad condition - scratched front and back , with a dent on the side apparently !
0	i can understand there to be a difference in opinion for the condition but not by this much !
0	what make it worse in my opinion is that they will only agree to the price quoted if they agree the condition , so where as my ipad could have been worth £_000 in the condition that they though it was , because the only agreed price is £_000 they new price is now £_000 which i think is wrong , and i would have been happy to accept the £_000 .
0	all '_s well that ends well though , i asked for my ipad back and then i sent it to carphonewarehouse yesterday and they have just replied by email agreeing the top price of an excellent condition ipad of £_000 . 00 ( which probably would have been more if i hadn_'_t have had my time wasted by gadgetpanda !
0	can '_t fault this store , everything is awesome , will shop_here forever .
0	very good no_problems , fast delivery , would use again .
0	great company
0	great shop all the time
0	banana_fingers is a store i always check out when i '_m searching for new climbing_equipment .

0	i always look around for the best bargin and very frequently i return to banana_fingers as they have what i want at the best value for money .
0	keep_up the great work guys .
0	ordered a new set of alloys for my tyre_fitting van , performance_alloys phoned me within 00_minutes to comfirm everything was correct , very professional .

0	this was my first time using supplementwarehouse . com and they '_ll compete prices with anyone and beat them !
0	excellent service , item arrived next_day , neatly_packaged and in fantastic condition .
0	would order from nevada again in a heartbeat .
0	they have whatever you need and for the best price .
0	great beer selection , very slick ordering_process and delivery is fantastic .
0	i '_ve_used a number of online beer retailers and beers of europe are by far the best .
0	this service provided me with exactly_what i wanted - a cheap , easy way to get money from my fiat account into btc .
0	as others have said , everything about the site is simple and intuitive , it feels trustworthy yet down to earth .
0	it would be nice if it could accept payments from credit / debit_cards , but that '_s completely not what the site is trying to do and i '_m well aware of the complexity and reasons other_sites don_'_t allow credit_card -> virtual currency .
0	after being referred by a colleague i decided to give this musclefood a go , i placed my first order and entered the ‘ hidden code ’ provided by my colleague , the offer was ; i would get 0 . 00kg of chicken_breast and he would get £ 0 off his next order .
0	when the food arrived the ice had ( just i think ) which i did not complain_about , i looked out for the extra chicken which did not arrive .
0	i ’ ve placed a second order a week_later with the musclefood hoping it would appear on the second order , this was not the case .
0	i contacted musclefood , i received a very poor response advising that i had to enter the code into the special promotions box for which i replied back that it is exactly_what i have done , i received a call a few hours_later advising that i would not receive the extra chicken_breast as i did not enter the code , when i challenged it the advisor suggested that it was my fault and i should have been more careful when processing my first order .
0	it was not so much about the 000g of chicken it was more in regards to the way it has_been handled , i would have spent close to £_000 a month -> £ 0000 a year on chicken through musclefood . com and they waved it off for the sake of £ 0 in chicken value .
0	i live in keyingham and the coverage is shit .
0	i come to hull and it '_s shit .
0	i have an ee contract and it '_s brilliant .
0	why does my phone struggle to even get 0g ?
0	ok so here '_s my second review ( i '_m still a little bored and in need of something to do )
0	lovefilm .
0	what can i say .
0	i don_'_t really think about it any more it just happens .
0	there has_been the odd issue , where i sent back a dvd and it took_ages to arrive back , and where they sent me the wrong disc .
0	but hey mistakes_happen from time to time , and the way i look at it , it '_s how you deal with those mistakes that really define you , and they dealt_with it , no_hassle , that '_s what i like , there '_s enough stress in this world already !
0	anyway i have my list of films , i tend to add a few here and there , they come , i watch , i send them back .
0	i also have the games option too but haven_'_t made much use of that yet .
0	to be precise my package consists of unlimited dvd / blu - ray / games , 0 discs at a time , and unlimited online streaming .
0	i can '_t remember exactly_what i pay now , around £_00 a month i think , but considering what i used to be paying at blockbuster that '_s fine with me .
0	i ' d definitely recommend them , and i '_m pretty sure they do a free trial , so give them a go , what have you got to lose .
0	:-)
0	i '_ve bought from this site a few_times now and thought i ' d share my opinion with others by writing this review .
0	this is my first ever review for anything !
0	but i '_m at a loss for something to do right now so why not !
0	lol .
0	i '_ve just completed my latest order , and it '_s just so easy .
0	extrascents have a fairly good range of products but more would be great .
0	for me that has_been the only_downside to what otherwise so_far has_been an excellent shopping_experience .
0	it '_s even better after you '_ve made your first order as you don_'_t have to enter all your details ( delivery address , card_details etc ) again .
0	a bonus for me as i '_m not keen on filling out forms etc , hence this being my first review .
0	the website is easy to find what you ' re looking for .
0	the prices are very competitive , and the ordering is hassle_free .
0	they offer a free delivery service , always a bonus , and so_far everything i have ordered has arrived just as i ' d expect .
0	i haven_'_t had any dealing_with their customer_services yet so i can '_t really say how helpful they are .
0	they do however send you an email after a couple of weeks asking you to review the product ( not the service mind ?)
0	and send you a discount for your next order if you complete the review .
0	i ' d definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a bargain on fragrance and cosmetics .
0	keep_up the good work extrascents ( i wonder_if they '_ll offer me a discount for this review ;-)
0	they have every brand you can think of .
0	good write_ups for each product as well
0	i would recommend going to newcastle for a stag_weekend to anyone via chillisauce !
0	as long as you and the group you are going with are going to have a good time not a fat lot can go_wrong !
0	we stayed in the the jurys inn in newcastle about a 0 minute taxi drive into the main street .
0	the hotel itself was immaculate and the breakfast was great !
0	we got entry into various clubs and bars and the night life is fantastic and the people are great !
0	we went paint - balling on the saturday which was great fun with the lads and friendly staff but the paintball facility itself wasn_'_t great as it was an open field with lots of obstacles .
0	all in all definitely a great weekend and a must do !
0	where to start .
0	firstly , speed checker on talk_talk '_s website provided an absurdly optimistic speed estimate for my area ( hither green , london ) presumably due to a software error .
0	i ordered their standard broadband package expecting a service fast enough to do all the usual things you ' d expect from the internet in 0000 , streaming hd_video , having more than a couple of devices hooked up etc .
0	anyway , we end up getting only 0 . 0mb down the line , the same speed i got on broadband a good 00 year_ago .
0	the house is in zone 0 in london so geography can '_t be a problem , surely .
0	anwyay , we made the call to upgrade to fibre and arranged over the phone for an engineer to make the installation on 00rd september and my flatmate booked the day off work to be there for the installation .
0	00rd rolls around and no engineer shows up .
0	phoned talk_talk and they say there '_s no record of anyone coming to make the installation and we ' d have to rebook another appointment ... the nearest one being 0_weeks away on 0rd october .
0	admittedly , we never received email confirmation of the engineer appointment , but the south_african talktalk customer service agent in early september did confirmed the installation time and date several_times over the phone .
0	things get ridiculous here as the talktalk customer service representative then books me an appointment on the 0rd without waiting for me to confirm that that was ok .
0	i '_m in germany with work that day so i ask her to change it to 0th_october when i have a day off work .
0	this was 00 seconds after she ' d made the booking but apparently it was too late and i ' d have to wait 00_hours to rebook a more suitable time .
0	i made the point that i doubted the date i actually had available would be free then but apparently there was nothing she could do about it .
0	at this point , i ' d had enough so i called customer_services who said they could put a note on the file to make provisions for compensation / credit but that i wouldn_'_t be able to phone and sort this out until the bloody fibre service was installed .
0	the employee couldn_'_t confirm the quantum of the compensation and the fibre '_s still not installed so who_knows_how much this will end up being .
0	then i tried to reschedule the fibre appointment 0 times this week via the talktalk website only to receive error messages that the service was unavailable and to try again later .
0	finally call the ( premium_rate ) phone line to book another appointment and the earliest date available is now 00th_october .
0	what a surprise .
0	so now i have to take a day off work in addition to the pointless day my flatmate has already wasted , adding up to c . £_000 of missed salary / holiday time .
0	long_story_short , save_yourself the hassle and go with bt or virgin .
0	i have dealt_with cheapsmells . com on 0 occasions and both have been very satisfactory .
0	i recently booked for 0 people to go to las_vegas staying at the planet_hollywood and was just about to book with virgin holidays when i checked the price on goamerica . co . uk .
0	it was over 00_%_cheaper for exactly the same holiday .
0	i just received the confirmation letter today - can '_t wait to go now !
0	roxy palace casino rocks !
0	i '_ve been lucky there a couple of times and the payouts are nice and quick .
0	best value & service on the net , my full order of 0 items all delivered with 00_hours , what else dose a contractor need .
0	got my key immediately .
0	customer_support / service is excellent and right there on the page .
0	the key activated fine and im definetely shopping here again .
0	cheers !
0	i bought a pair of dragon sunglasses .
0	i was very pleased at the beginning but after i kept them in the car for a while they started to deform from the high heat inside .
0	i called them and they offered a refund on the spot .
0	i could not be_bothered to send them back , because is not visible when i wear them .
0	nevertheless , i will_definitely buy from this shop again as it offers a great service and very good prices .
0	keep on the good work , you have 0_stars from me .
0	i had a few queries and needed a bit of advice .
0	so i used the live_chat and got an immediate_response from a chap_called mike .
0	he answered and asked me questions advised me on my desktop ram how many to buy and keep my installed ram .
0	i found a cheap pair if discounted tights ( cycle_clothing is overly priced everywhere anyway ) and this was the first pair of tights i '_ve ever bought .
0	i was extremely pleased to see the product arrive within 0 days .
0	however , i was just as satisfied even more so when i wore the tights .
0	great product .
0	great service .
0	great product as_described for good price and quick delivery .
0	very informative and friendly on the phone , next_day delivery as promised and great price .
0	many_thanks for selling my phones , helped_me out alot so many_thanks for your help and making it happen so quick and easy aswell : d
0	hello all ,
0	perfect solution how to unlock your phone .
0	unlockservice work very fast and without no_problems .
0	thank_you !
0	!
0	i love the website design , the competition and sky in general : d
0	i was suspicious to start with , the games were so much_cheaper , but i thought i would give it a shot as i would save around £_00 .
0	i ordered my game late christmas_eve and received my key within 00_minutes .
0	i will be using simplygames very soon .
0	took over a month for parts to arrive after 0 + telephone_calls .
0	told every time that the parts would arrive the next_day .
0	they just tell you a story to pacify you and get you off the phone .
0	collect when they say they will every time and i have never had anything ' go missing ' like other carriers .
0	very fast service and verification is effortless !
0	thank_you :)
0	i would recommend trend sunglasses to all my friends and family !
0	great prices , speedy delivery and quality service like no other !
0	better_than all the major high_street_shops !
0	not the best site ive looked at and not many promotions or loyalty schemes like skybet or betfair unfortunately
0	i '_ve_used pretty_much all the mobile_networks in the past ; vodafone , orange , o0 ... and it seems the whole time i was paying too much for too little .
0	i wish i ' d discovered t - mobile sooner ; these days i get more messages , more data and more minutes for my money , and better coverage too !
0	i '_ll be honest , given the price i paid for my three - seater metal futon , i wasn_'_t expecting much , but i have to say i '_m really impressed !
0	the bed looks good , is sturdy and surprisingly comfortable and the company were very friendly and accommodating , especially when it turned_out there was a manufacturing_fault with the mattress .
0	without_any fuss_whatsoever , sleep solutions arranged to have it swapped with a new one at my earliest_possible convenience : very slick service indeed .
0	top_marks from me .
0	after receiving a refund ( for a significant_amount ) from a item brought on ebay , i waited for the usual 0 - 0 working_days for the amount to clear back into my account during this time it displayed as pending .
0	on the 0th day the amount had still not cleared and all records of the transaction had disappeared from my account .
0	i phoned them immediately only to be told that your transaction has_been ' lost ' during a technical_error and we don_'_t know when you '_ll receive it .
0	it is now over 00 days since the transaction and i am still without my refund , if this had occurred with my bank or credit_card company the monies would have been refunded straight_away .
0	i am pretty sure this is in breach of fsa regulations .
0	so avoid if you can but seeing though they ' re weaved into almost every online shop its not that easy !
0	i must have bought 0 pairs of glasses by now .
0	every time i can '_t believe the quality and price .
0	best place online to get specs .
0	0 * s in my opinion
0	so much_better value for money than using the networks provided insurance
0	ordered a bouquest of flowers for my mother for mothers_day 00 . 00 . 00 .
0	got an email at 00 : 00 stating " we regret to inform you that delivery has not been possible on the date you selected !
0	however we are happy to rearrange for delivery as quickly as possbile , including an upgrade to your order at our cost , by way of apology for the late delivery .
0	of course you are welcome to choose to cancel your order and we will refund you in full ."
0	i paid a £ 0 . 00 extra delivery charge to get them there for mothers_day .
0	they havent even offered to refund that part and still deliver the flowers .
0	this seems to just be a scam company offering next_day delivery fot mothers_day .
0	they take your hard_earned_money then send you an email and deliver the flowers when they feel like it .
0	not happy
0	i have used other online flowers companies in the past and had no_problems .
0	i certainly wont be using eflorist again and i will be telling everyone who will listen to me to avoid them .
0	please reply eflorist ?
0	even better phone me ?
0	their customer_services was very helpful , the card i need to make payment with had a different address , from my delivery and invoice_address .
0	staff had no problem with processing the order .
0	goods arrived on time .
0	i ordered a fellowes venus a0 laminator and got a free prom pack from fellowes , which were posted for no extra_cost .
0	this company will give you an attractive offer to make_sure that they get , in my case my phone , and when they get it they will drastically lower the value of the offer .
0	this will be lower_than what you will be guaranteed off far better known and reputable_companies .
0	they will allow you to get the product back but will charge you for this so you will feel , like i did , backed into a corner to accept or face losing money by paying for your property back .
0	yes i got a revised_offer , but an insult with and extra £ 0 .
0	would have had an extra £_00 on top of this if i hadn_'_t gone with this company .
0	my advice would be avoid this company .
0	stated on their website under " our promise " is that you can contact [_name_] the md via_email if you ’ re not satisfied ; don_'_t bother you won_'_t get a response .
0	i will not use this company again and will never recommend them .
0	terrible customer service and the worst i have ever_experienced .
0	supplementwarehouse . com has all the products you ' re looking for at the best prices you can find .
0	i love buy multiple months supplies of all my products .
0	the shipping is quick and reliable , within a week .
0	plus , you can usually find some interesting freebies to try out !
0	no really ...
0	i '_m waiting for our old dyson to die a death so i can justify buying a shiny_new one ...
0	the damned thing refuses to give up the ghost after 0 years of forced hard labour ...
0	even my 0 year_old_son didn_'_t kill it when he pushed it down the stairs !
0	just all clipped back together !
0	maybe we '_ll have to try fire next !!
0	thank_you dyson for top quality kit ... you '_ve ruined my need to buy a new shiny model ...
0	honestly ...
0	i '_ve been with orange for many_years ...
0	they never_fail to deliver what they offer ...
0	customer service is top_notch and when it came to upgrade i had no issues talking with them to bash out a deal that suited my needs at the right price !
0	top_marks folks ...
0	every online sales company should be like this one ... why settle for second best or faffing with ebay when its this easy ...
0	even the companies own kit is excellent for the money ... what more could you want ?
0	cheers folks ... keep_up the good work !
0	received tickets today !
0	0nd of november !
0	came first_class !
0	thankyou
0	i received the order in reasonable time , but this item king of shaves super skin face scrub 000ml spilled almost_half inside the package over other products .
0	i would be glad to receive a replacement .
0	excellently arranged with no_hastle , alex the account_manager was really helpful , even managed to rearrange the karting 0 days before the stag as the last place got robbed .
0	well_worth talking to chilly sauce , much_better_than some the the stag companies operations that i have seen on other dos .
0	these_guys are soon going to be making and providing all our services from phones to entertainment to food delivery .
0	google is the largest and most widespread company i can think of on the internet ; and off of it - to cover all grounds from email ( gmail ), photos ( picasa ), maps ( earth ), social ( buzz ), tv ( googletv ), translate ( translate ), operating_systems ( chromeos ), mobiles ( android )... and the list_goes on and on .
0	im not going to say too much ; out of all their products i use gmail , android and their world - class search_engine the most .
0	in which i '_ve never been let_down .
0	the only thing is i personally don_'_t like the new google image search ; but i '_m_sure this will become better once we ' re all using faster internet providers .
0	good luck to google - and i hope they bring us many more great products in the future .
0	i am , like most teens - on facebook .
0	i make about 00 posts every day ( much to the digression of my friends ) about everything ranging_from my day at college , quotes , music , film - all_sorts .
0	ive been using the service since late - 0000 and have watched the many updates .
0	the problem with facebook is it keeps wanting to ' tamper ' with itself - which is just making it worse , and terrible to use .
0	instead of looking at making the website run faster , produce less errors etc they seem to find it more useful to introduce futile additions such as ' the light box ' ( or theatre mode for viewing picture ) or changing the layout of my newsfeed etc .
0	there are so many problems with facebook ; i question why ' we ' all use it still .
0	i understand its such a hive of activity ; but so is google - and they don_'_t seem to have a problem ( thinking of all their services mail , search , checkout , translate , maps , picasa , buzz etc_.)
0	?
0	im not the only one to think this .
0	on a postive note ; it has revolutionized how we all communicate with each other - and everything which used to be seen as ' private ' ends up on facebook , and we are now communicating with each other 00_hours of a day .
0	being_able to ' look through the keyhole ' at other_peoples lives ..... it is an astonishing thing facebook - its just so broken .
0	if facebook are reading this ; then here '_s my message .
0	ok , you '_ve sorted_out the privacy ( great thanks for that by the way :) ), but now can you look to sorting_out the stability and performance of your website ?
0	instead of tinkering with stupid things that no - one wants , and look crass ( i . e .
0	light - box ).
0	easy quick process from_start to finish .
0	ordering on the internet is a lot more informative as you can see all the other tyre prices and details of the tyre '_s you wouldn_'_t normally see .
0	very good choice of shades and really good value for money .
0	i can see so much_better now .
0	i have bought supplements from supplementwarehouse several_times , unlike every where else they are upfront about their pricing .
0	when you check out some places online their instore prices are different and they will not match it .
0	supplementwarehouse is straight_forward , honest , awesome , and the only place to get the best deals on supplements .
0	the shipping is great , affordable , and most_importantly fast .
0	thanks supplement_warehouse for being the best there is .
0	i ordered some stuff online and for a good price .
0	there was a bit of a cock_up with the payment , probably my fault doing it over 0g_network .
0	i gave them a quick ring and it was sorted_out straight_away .
0	i received the item next_day for free delivery .
0	spot on .
0	not a single glitch when buying an_engagement_ring .
0	i was kept_fully up to date with the progress .
0	they were happy to delay delivery so that the ring wouldn_'_t arrive when the missus was at home .
0	iflorist have delivered the wrong flowers !
0	i ordered a purple bouquet for my wife ( her_favourite colour ) which was supposed to have purple roses within it .
0	whilst it arrived today on time , the flowers are completely_different to my order and to me they don_'_t look to be in the freshest state .
0	when i emailed their cusomer service department to request a refund i am told that their terms and conditions_state that they can change the flowers for another set of the higher or same value in the instance that they run out of the ordered bouquet .
0	well if what they delivered is the same or better , then i '_m a monkeys uncle !
0	my suggestion is to avoid this lot .
0	their customer service team also seems to be based overseas which in my experience is not not conducive to a good business .
0	i '_m still arguing for my refund , so_far i have only been offered another bouquet .
0	i will post back if i do get a refund or further experiences .
0	i just bought a 0d ... placed order on friday , received it monday_morning .
0	i couldn_'_t ask for better .
0	love the bbc website , just sucks that they were forced to shut_down some sections because they were too good and the competition complained !!
0	the bbc can do everything better_than anyone_else ... please let them !
0	cheapest price on web and next_day delivery even_though i ticked the free delivery option !
2	this is a company that takes customer_care seriously .
2	we received really impressive service when we contacted the company .
2	advice was free and plentiful .
2	the goods arrived ahead of schedule and were as expected .
2	regrettably one of the items had a manufacturing_fault which was only discovered after four weeks .
2	they quickly agreed to collect the item and replace it .
2	i remain impressed .

2	provides a quicker , responsive and value for money service .
2	the service provided by this company is exemplary .
2	it '_s prices are very competitive and are underlain by a professional attitude to delivering its products quickly with little fuss and no bother .
2	this suppler provides a fast and ost effecitive serives .
2	its prices are compeitive and it is proactive when making_sure its customers know where their order are at all times .
2	i '_ve_used this company before .
2	it '_s staff are friendly and helpful .
2	in addition , its prices are comparable with the cheapest ( for genuine goods ) on ebay .
2	the spd lugs seem genuine and great value even in comparison prices on ebay .
2	the jacket was well made and the website appears to offer two shades of red ; red and dark red .
2	in practice , however , it only dispatches dark red and this only becomes apparent once the goods are delivered .
2	if the company would have delivered what is described on it '_s website then i would been happy .
2	please_note that the company is a bit_slow when it comes to refunding payments .
2	as above .
2	as above .
2	very easy to order .
2	i always check prices with the competition before ordering .
2	so_far on all my orders since using viovet , the company is always slightly_cheaper , when the free delivery is taken into account .
2	my last order was made on a thursday and was at my door the very next_day .
2	fantastic !
2	in the last 00 days , we have ordered and received 0 electrical items .
2	each time , not only did they come exactly when advised , but was text the day before , was advised in the morning what time it was due to arrive and they did .
2	the delivery men mobiled when they were at the end of the road and they were courteous and helpful on arrival .
2	thank_you for all your input , which sometimes is not always there with other_companies .
2	the slate_house name received this week was as good as we had hoped , the white word depth was better and deeper than_expected .
2	we hav ' nt fitted it yet , but as an electrician i will have no trouble ( they even supplied the plugs and screws )
2	we will_certainly praise your product and the way you kept us informed during the purchase time to the time it arrived here at the shires .

2	we required a dimplex controller urgently , after_contacting jay at fastlec
2	we were very surprised he had them in stock , as promised , the controller arrived the next evening at about 00 . 00hrs .
2	on the afternoon of the arrival , we received email confirmation of the approx time of delivery .
2	well_done , fastlec .
2	i have been in the electrical contracting business
2	since_0000 and at last i have seen what can be done , by good people
2	had the head of a excellent company .
2	i have never used this method
2	of praise before , so like good business practice there is a first time for
2	everything and everybody .
2	thanks again , jay and all the best to you .
2	i have purchased a product , via amazon , and the supplier uses_yodel to deliver to their customers .
2	i received notification , and tracked same , yesterday 00 / 00 / 00 that it would be delivered on same day .
2	it did not happen .
2	tracking it today and the data has_been removed from the tracking yodel data_base so i have no idea when to expect it .
2	i have used the amazon contact procedure , the suppliers contact procedure and obviously yodel also .
2	no response received from any one although after a number of years of use i have never had this problem before with amazon .
2	i had never_heard of yodel before yesterday and i am not surprised .
2	no company i do_business with would consider_using them .
2	fine as usual , they didn_'_t have my tyre in stock so allowed_us a free upgrade and fitted them the next_day .
2	pretty good for the isle of man .
2	will use again soon .
2	thanks
2	i was completely_satisfied with both the offer and service i received from mazuma .
2	they did exactly_what they promised and paid me promptly , pretty_much by return .
2	i would have no_hesitation in both recommending them to my friends or using them again to sell on a no_longer needed phone .
2	i would sell my old_iphone 0 but it is too useful as an ipod
2	i always buy from refreshcartridges .
2	delivery to ireland within 00_hrs great product thank_you ( a refreshing way to do_business )
2	il be back . used you for a few_years_now .
2	thanks
2	no problem , delivered in two_days .
2	ordered online one day got it the next .
2	the first website i look on when i require new gear - everything very well priced , with excellent , helpful staff always happy to assist .
2	nothing is too much_trouble for these_guys !
2	i first emailed them for advice on what memory i needed for my old nec computer .
2	very prompt and helpful reply far more so than nec !!
2	i ordered the memory_sticks they said were compatible with my machine .
2	i received the order promptl .
2	they were well_packaged and most_importantly worked_perfectly and have totally_transformed my pc .. verall it received excellent service and would not_hesitate to recommend this company to anyone .
2	i have used this company several_times over the last_year .
2	delivery has always been prompt and the goods of good quality at reasonable prices .
2	i would not_hesitate to recommend others to use this company .
2	i will_certainly continue to use them .
2	quick delivery and most_importantly it is doing the job .
2	we have problems every year with rats in the chicken shed .
2	this year within 0 days of laying down the poison we have found a number of dead rats and seem to have cleared all rats from the area .
2	would recommend this pack to anyone .
2	still_waiting for my goods after 0_weeks .
2	i have left messages on their answerphone and emailed them but no replies received .
2	when i eventually_managed to talk to someone on the phone they were very pleasant and plausible - " goods not in stock in the warehouse but you will get them within a few_days !!"
2	then a week_later " parcel was sent by first_class post so you should have received it we will investigate and call you back " - they didn_'_t .
2	when i called them they said they had issued another invoice and the goods would be with me within a few_days .
2	taht was almost a week_ago and i still_haven_'_t received them .
2	this was my first shopping_experience with this company and will be tha last .
2	i buy a lot of goods over the internet and i can say that this is by far the worst experience i have ever had .
2	not working for me through explorer , nearly missed bargain but went through chrome and went ok .
2	just a few_clicks and the job is done , if only all web sites were as easy to use .
2	highly_recommend the ebookers site for ease of use .
2	*****
2	did not receive order ,,,,
2	ray could not have done enough to help , with all the changes we made , he never once became flustered .
2	brilliant company to deal with
2	i '_ve ordered stuff several_times from wetsuitoutlet and it always arrives quickly .
2	the one time i '_ve had to return something for a refund ( i ordered the wrong_size ) that was processed quickly too .
2	what looks_like a simple way to get a divorce quickly becomes very expensive with divorce - online .
2	the basic price only covers the company filling in the divorce petition form for you .
2	it '_s then up to you to submit it to the court with the appropriate fee .
2	if you want divorce - online to handle the whole divorce for you , it gets very expensive .
2	having forked out for the petition to be filled in , i ran_out of money and was unable to pay divorce - online to manage the rest of the process .
2	the forms that i ' d paid for were useless as they showed divorce - online as my legal representative .
2	result ?
2	£_000 flushed down the toilet .
2	divorce - online wanted over £_000 plus the £_000 court fee just to get me to the decree nisi stage .
2	in the end i submitted my own divorce petition to the court , using online help notes and a bit of " trial and error " training .
2	way back in june , my wife bought some pre_- packed strawberries from sainsburys .
2	when she was cleaning them she noticed several blue pellets in the base of the pack in contact with the fruit .
2	we thought these were rat_poison and were horrified to think what could have happened had the grandchildren been with us and helped themselves to the fruit .
2	although the immendiate reaction by sainsburys was good , ( the assistant manage visited us with replacements within a hour ), things then stalled .
2	the grower contacted us to apologise and explain that the pellets were slug pellets ( rat_poison , slug poison ... both are not really part of a healthy_diet ).
2	he promised some of his best cherries when they were in season as goodwill .
2	sadly he forgot and it was 00 weeks_later after we made several contacts with sainsburys that a tray of apples , pears and plums suddenly arrived ... no note ... no apology , nothing even to indicate the sender .
2	we are dissappointed by sainsburys because we have had to push all the way to get any reaction .
2	nothing was forthcoming .
2	we were not after material gain , just a good old_fashioned apology .
2	maybe a token of goodwill would have been in order , but not the prime aim .
2	we have received a £_00 to shut us up ( as well as the anonymous tray of fruit ) but no one has taken the time and trouble to write to us to apologise for what could easily have been a nasty incident .
2	can you imagine the headlines ' child poisoned by poisoned strawberries '.
2	sainsburys don_'_t seem to have thought beyond the '£ 00 , now shut - up ' stage .
2	come on sainsburys , time to put the care back in customer_care .
2	a clue .
2	swallow your pride , put pen to paper and apologise .
2	the £_00 voucher is not the way forward .
2	very fast service , 0nd time i '_ve sold a phone to them , second time they have beaten anyones prices , ( including vodafone ).
2	i selected the item i wanted , i then went thru the simple checkout system and paid for it and 0 days_later i recieved it - perfect !
2	it was easy .
2	the item was very well_packaged and well i was delighted .
2	as quick as i wanted it , it was here and in use - what more can any musician want - thank_you reidy_'_s .
2	if you want good quality chocolate at a reasonable price you can '_t go_wrong with chocolate_trading
2	needed a comfort height toilet , shower bath and basin , others did all but the toilet and a few did all but for a lot more money than bestbathrooms . com .
2	nearly everything arrived when they said it would but the very small error with a couple of items was resolved by very helpful customer service staff and missing items were received the next_day .
2	product choice and quality is excellent and i can recommend bestbathrooms without_hesitation to all looking for good quality at a good price .
2	i can not fault spartoo with their web_site , choice of shoes , contact and delivery which was free and my shoes arrived four days after i ordered them .
2	the free returns_policy will not be needed which does not surprise me as timberland are extremely well made shoes .
2	so if you if you find what you want on spartoo do not_hesitate to order from them , you will not be disappointed !!
2	!
2	the washer i wanted but cheaper_than everyone_else , delivery and removal of the old machine could not have been better , kept_informed at all times of delivery time which was at 00 : 00 on sunday morning , this included confirmation_email at 0am and an_automated phone_call just in case you miss the email .
2	early deliver meant the washing could be done on sunday and after an easy installation the samsung was so easy to use , quiet and looks good .
2	i can recommend this samsung_washer and appliances_online to all .
2	i found the service easy , straight_forward and very professional and at the fraction of the cost of a high_street agent .
2	everything was up and running online quite quickly and within a couple of days i had my first viewings through the door .
2	having the control to make amendments to your listing online rather_than having them dictated to you was a plus .
2	i will be honest in saying that i was a bit_nervous_about using an online estate_agent at first and it may not suit everyone , but for me it did the job and i would not_hesitate using house_network again .
2	having had a bad_experience with another online company pretending to be a uk organisation , i re - ordered a camera through valuebasket . com , again not realising they are based overseas and pretend to be a uk company with phone numbers etc .
2	they claim their phone system is not working , their customer ' service ' agents do not read emails properly and i cannot seem to get a refund .
2	now the status of my order has_been changed to order held and i have had to send yet another email via their website simply asking for my money back .
2	it appears they are very poor at refunding your money , although they seem to be able to extract it from your account quickly enough .
2	foreign companies pretending to be british based are ruining the internet_shopping_experience .
2	valuebasket , com have my money , will not agree to a refund and have put my order on hold , so i am apparently not going to get my camera or my money back .
2	i will have to go sheepishly to my bank to get a refund of the money , twice , and surprisingly taken by the same payment organisation company skrill limited each time .
2	what a coincidence ..
2	i hold out little hope of receiving my money back from these_people , they are too evasive and slippery .
2	all i can say is avoid them like the plague if you value your hard_earned_cash .
2	i will happily update this review if i get a refund within a week , but i think hell is more likely to freeze over first .
2	00th_october .... despite the promise below , no change in my account balance and no - one bothered to get in touch with me .
2	so it is starting to appear that they are even worse than i thought .
2	i tried to buy a camera for my wife .
2	the website appeared to be a uk company and the price was good , so i ordered the camera .
2	it turns_out they are based in hong_kong , masquerading as a uk company .
2	my wife '_s birthday came and went , but the camera never arrived .
2	after several phone_calls where they tried to claim that my camera somehow got damaged , and they couldn_'_t say when it would be delivered , i asked for my money back .
2	they told me this would take 00 - 00 working_days .
2	this has come and gone , and when i spoke to the agent on the phone , they said they were having trouble processing refunds , and couldn_'_t say when it would be , although it was now ' expedited ' which is meaningless .
2	they process the payment through a company called skrill ltd , which are also used by valuebasket . com ( yes , when i cancelled my order i ordered another camera ) who are as difficult to deal with , saying they have a backlog and won_'_t give a delivery date either , although claim to have 00 camera '_s in stock .
2	they are not acknowledging my request for a cancellation at all .
2	i think the two companies are related , or one and the same .
2	they definitely appear on your credit_card statement as the same payment company , and both masquerade as a uk company with uk phone numbers .
2	i now need to explain this whole sorry story to my credit_card company totry and get the money refunded by them , but my advice to any potential_clients of either company is totally avoid like the plague .
2	they are either internet fraudsters or just totally inept .
2	either way , simply_electronics ltd have made my blood boil , and still have my money .,
2	00rd_october update .
2	following the comment below , simply_electronics have now refunded my money , thank_you .
2	mothers_day flowers .
2	a sad affair .
2	the flowers my mother recieved was a disgrace for the money i paid .... have used this company before for sending flowers , but will not use again ..... was proper mugged this time .. never again ...
2	brilliant service , wonderful bouqets , what you see is what you get , pick a pic .
2	value for money , well_done ...
2	slight_problem in using the online ordering as i was not able to download the repeat_prescription for the item i wanted to order .
2	i rang the company and was able to send the lady an email and then order the goods over the phone .
2	this item that i bought is charged at £_00 by the vets i go - they charge me £_00 for the prescription which animed_direct charge £_00 . 00 and no shipping charge .
2	the item arrived 0 days_later - excellent service - well_done and thank_you .
2	dave barrow
2	great product , good and timely service .
2	i would definately_use them again .

2	service , marvellous , cards unbeatable , convenience , unavailable !!!
2	thankyou .
2	from the moment you contact them they keep in touch with genuine concern that you are pleased with both the product and their service
2	as with all the people i have put their way ......
2	i was delighted .
2	es - wilts .
2	for what you pay you get the world !
2	a great price metal_shed that fitted together really well .
2	it is water_proof and rodent proof .
2	not really quick to assemble but you need to take your time and get it right .
2	i would be more than happy to recommend this company and it '_s products .
2	great site for all your battery needs .
2	rapid delivery and old_fashioned service .
2	a refreshing_change compared with some companies .
2	fully recommended .
2	i have sent for several items from procook and would recommend them 000_%.

2	best exchange_rates , best buy back rates and best service all_round .
2	get all your printing done here , as well as other goodies .
2	all printed with your name on .
2	watch out for all the free stuff as well .
2	ok , you pay postage , but you will with most sites .
2	this site has never ever answered a question correctly and i really do wonder what it '_s purpose is .
2	why shop for presents in cold shopping malls when you can get gift_wrapped stuff for all the family at amazon .
2	my favorite online store .
2	the only place on the high where you can get those elusive electronic items .
2	i love browsing round these shops and always spend more than i intend because of the vast_range of stuff .
2	great company , and more legroom than monarch .
2	always a pleasure to deal with .
2	great site , easy to use and great delivery times .
2	if only all companies were like this .
2	order no .

2	was delivered later than the one hour time_slot_allocated . no apologies received or notification he would be late .
2	have never used there mobile fitting service before but found the whole_experience exceptional and on this occasion found no fault what so - ever .
2	special consideration should be given to the fitter for his great customer service .
2	cheapest one i have found , ideal for summer hols .
2	very good , smooth_operation , works very well .

2	delivery information was excellent .
2	arrived next_day as promised and the price was very keen . already_recommended to friends .
2	would definitely use again .
2	helen couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
2	everything was explained throughly and the service was excellent .
2	my lump_sum came through sooner_than_expected and my pension with the new provider has_gone_through seamlessly .
2	i would recomment age_partnership to anyone .
2	000000
2	in a service sector plagued by unhappy clients who engage with unreliable rental_companies , carhire0000 proved_themselves to be extremely efficient , helpful ( on the phone ) and able to offer excellent prices .
2	we had been concerned that our hirer was a certain locauto ( italian rental ) that has racked_up a not inconsiderable volume of complaints , some just shy of fraud .
2	as it turned_out , the locauto office at palermo airport couldn_'_t have been more helpful ... though i have only been back one day , i have their reassurance that my card_details are now blocked , and no money can be taken as we signed the vehicle off in full .
2	if there is a problem , i am confident ch0000 will back me up .
2	there is little doubt also that there are some awful hirers out there who don_'_t fill up tanks as requested on return and treat their rental vehicles poorly and thus an air of mistrust has built up .
2	sofa should be delivered 00 july , phone_call from very rude staff_member on the 00 july to say container with my sofa on never arrived and they don_'_t know when it will be arriving , this also applied to many other dissatisfied_customers .
2	booking the day off work and i am sure if you thought your sofa was being delivered the following_day you most certainly would not have your old one meaning people are left to sit on the floor .
2	i am certain that sofa works would have been informed well before the day before delivery that it was not arriving on time .
2	containers take days to arrive so surely they would have known well in advance but failed to inform their customers .
2	i have heard from neighbours and a family_members the same situation happened with them with sofa works and they have had to wait several weeks after arranged delivery date for their sofa to arrive .
2	i will be asking them to review their experience on this site so more people can be made aware before purchasing from this company .
2	i have always purchased from dfs never had an issue and customer service excellent unlike this company .
2	i hope now that the ceo jason . tyldesley @ csl - furniture . co . uk does the decent thing and returns my deposit as requested and have a word with your suppliers they are giving you a bad_reputation !!!
2	more details of the response from jason to follow .
2	great price , great range of stock , very nice website , order conformation was quick and well detailed .
2	very happy
2	it was the cheapest price on the net i could_find , order process was quick and easy with multiple was to pay , conformation_email was quick and all details easy to check
2	another email was sent next_day with tracking_information and the day after they where delivered
2	overall a quick , cheap and pleasant_experience and now they are my 0st choice when i '_m looking to buy the next bike part or cycle_clothing
2	developing our on - line retail service for the sale of our portable wireless alarms for our rural property watch service required a cost - effective and reliable parcel delivery service .
2	discovering parcel0go with a user - friendly website , convenient paypal payment facility and the convenience of dropping my parcels at our local_spar convenience store , just yards from us , was just the lucky break we needed .
2	i am_delighted with parcel0go , thank_you .
2	i needed a new printer , thought i would give ebuyer a bite of the cherry this time .
2	gobsmacked by the deliveries choices available , ok so i paid a little extra to have
2	next_morning delivery .. and sure_enough it arrived before_noon .. no looking back , so sorry argos , you and your 00 days for delivery are history !
2	incorrect billing from october still not resolved , because it '_s impossible to get through to the call_centre !..
2	emails just seem to go into a black_hole and get ignored ..
2	they ' re only interested in sending final demands , whether correct or not !
2	the call_centre must be woefully under - manned , and i don_'_t think this is a temporary blip , but here to stay .
2	the poorest customer service i '_ve had in 00 years as customer of goods & services !
2	the price was good , the service & delivery was excellent .. can '_t ask for more than that !
2	shopped with go - electrical following a good product from which giving a selection of online suppliers .
2	they were the cheapest , and the next_day i was emailed with a delivery eta .
2	on the day of delivery another email arrived giving the time_slot down to 0 hour and an option to defer if not suitable .
2	the goods arrived bang on time = happy customer ;-)
2	prompt accurate service as always .
2	good prices and the chocolate treat a nice_touch .
2	impressive rang of all types of batteries .
2	definitely use for future requirements .
2	really good service .
2	if you have a problem or question ( even if it '_s a stupid one ) they '_ll get back to you very quickly and give you patient advice .
2	if the phone is engaged when you ring their support line they ring you back .
2	highly_recommended .
2	excellent service i received my dvd_player the very next_day .
2	you cannot ffault this service is 000_percent
2	brought a grundfos pump 0 years_ago and have been very disappointed so much noise could be heard all over the house and did not last that long .
2	so i looked for a replacement and brought a salamander rhp 0 . 0 bar
2	very easy to install and boy how quite so much_better_than the grundfos
2	only time will tell if it lasts_longer_than the grundfos
2	so_far 00 / 00
2	i would recommend this company to anyone
2	excellent service .
2	. 0 tickets for leonard coen as a suprise christmas_present for my sister long time l . c fan i dug deep and explained to my good lady wife that it was both a christmas and birthday_present and hid the reciept face value of tickets £_00 actual cost of tickets £_000 does the phase ," ever feel like you have been ripped_off " mean anything to anyone anymore nothing more than legalised stealing and the fact that they are associated with the nme is also shameful they are not helping the fan they are exploiting them .
2	avoid this site is not very good either so_far on my 0th review but it keeps_crashing anyway
2	very impressed with the pricing , advice and speed of dispatch .
2	i called to order a printer but after_speaking to jessica decided to go with the one she advised me to buy .
2	my it helper was that impressed with the printer / pricing / level of service , he decided to order one for himself !!
2	thanks .
2	brilliant service !
2	not the cheapest but very nearly .
2	would definitely use them again .

2	then contacting them to be told go away we '_ll get back to you one day sticks in the gullett .
2	i am about to issue a summons to the small_claims court .
2	the customer service is non - existent and the contempt is par_excellence .
2	i would never ever go to this company and i would actively dissuade anyone from using it - unless they want a protracted dispute , appalling ryan_air style customer service , and a trip to the small_claims court .
2	to date no goods received no refund and no further communication .

2	will_definitely be shopping here again in future - many_thanks !
2	!
2	they had what i wanted , it came quickly .
2	would use again .
2	just when i thought i had seen every scam , sharp_practice and rip_off that holiday autoes could throw at me , you come up with an_absolute beauty .
2	you should be really proud of yourself because this must have made you millions of pounds whilst distressing thousands of your customers , not just me .
2	before i continue , i ask that in any response to me you don_’_t insult me by saving it is nothing to do with you and it ’_s your suppliers .
2	or tell me it ’_s on the terms and conditions .
2	i run my own business and when a client deals with our company we are responsible for all parts of the supply_chain .
2	i would not expect to complain to a supermarket to be told to go and speak to the farmer .
2	i know that you are aware , understand and agree to all charges , conditions and operating practices of the car_hire_companies .
2	when i book a car through holiday autoes that is exactly_what i do .
2	if you ( like at my company ) did not agree with the terms of a supplier then you can either get them to change the way they operate or you could drop them as a supplier , from this i conclude that you have sat down with them at formal meetings and agreed all charges and ways of working , you have therefore agreed to these scams .
2	if not , your set_up is amateurish .
2	the scam that has really got me angry this time is arriving to pick_up my car , after paying for everything i wanted on line to be hit with additional_costs of 000_euros ( in case you think this is a typo , you are right one hundred and ninety six euros .)
2	we travelled on one of the busiest fridays of the season friday 00th_july , to one of the busiest airports alicante , at the busiest of times , after work on friday .
2	when i picked_up my car , the airport was packed with families picking_up cars and after waiting for an_hour was charged an additional 00uros ( thirty five euros ) it appeared on the bill as “ others ” when i challenged this i was told it was because it was late .
2	now let_me remind you of something , it was “ peak time ”, peak_season and the airport was packed so why did you charge me 00_euros extra ?
2	i could understand if it was 0am at an airport that was closed but this was the main pick_up period .
2	this scam is a disgrace and you should be_ashamed of yourself .
2	is it your policy to try and ruin hard working customers holidays before they have even begun ?
2	and before you try , in your usual way , of distancing yourself from all your responsibilities , i would also like to mention that friends on the same flight as us who booked their car through another company , not holiday_autos , were not charged this 00_euros .
2	i want this 00_euros refunding to me .
2	the second part of your scam was the additional driver cover on the policy .
2	you can ’_t go on a family holiday and not have additional_insurance_cover .
2	if the main driver was not able to drive ( sprained_ankle for example ) then you have to make_sure you can legally drive .
2	we were charged 00_euros for this .
2	now to put this into context , only one person can drive the car at a time and my wife driving is no more likely to have an accident than me so why were we charged a rate equivalent to 0 , 000_euros a year .
2	this is over 0 times my fully comprehensible insurance cost at home to drive .
2	and this is an extra don_’_t forget on top of the car_hire cost which was inclusive of insurance .
2	you can ’_t say it is an admin_charge at this rate .
2	also , my wife put herself down as second driver on our friends car , the family who did not book through holiday autoes and they were charged 00_euros , so explain_why the same person is charged_twice as much through holiday autoes
2	i want 00_euros refunded to me for this overcharge compared to other_companies
2	the third part of your scam is the fuel charge .
2	we were charged 000_euros for fuel we did not want or need .
2	as well as the rip_off factor , i would also like to question your corporate responsibility .
2	according to my research , the fuel_tank size of the berlingo is 00 litres .
2	the cost of fuel at the time of the trip was 0 . 00 per_litre which equates to 00_euros .
2	you charged me 000_euros , a difference of 00_euros .
2	what a rip_off .
2	i want this 00_euros refunding to me .
2	no one can dive a car and return it empty , this is impossible for obvious_reasons , at the best there would be 0 litres left in the tank .
2	how dare you charge for the full 00 litres when nobody can or would risk driving to empty ?
2	i want 0 euros refunding to me to cover the fuel that is always left in a tank
2	a full_tank covers 0000_km , how many people do you know who drive this distance on a beach family holiday .
2	we have been charged this amount before by holiday autoes for a 0 day holiday .
2	this would equate to an annual mileage of 00 , 000_km .
2	we did not want this fuel yet we were charged for it .
2	in the past you have said that some customers prefer to do it this way , well firstly i have never spoken to anybody who has said that , and secondly , if that is true you should allow customers to choose .
2	it would be a 0 minute job to add to the website the fuel_policy choice to enable people to return the car full or empty , the fact that you don_’_t provide this choice proves to me you are part of this fuel rip_off and profiting from it .
2	my company creates websites so i know this to be a very simple job .
2	i want 00_euros refunding for the ¼ tank of fuel i was unable to use .
2	what infuriates almost as much as your contempt for your customers and your clear determination to rip each and every one off as much as possible , is your contempt for the planet we live on .
2	it is now proven the link between carbon emissions and global warming yet your fuel policies actively encourage people to use more fuel than they need , you will frequently hear the phrase “ we might as well drive as we have paid for the fuel ” how can you sleep at night knowing you are contributing to the death of the planet just so you can dishonestly make a few extra pounds , do you not have any corporate responsibility at all .
2	do you not care about the next generation who will inherit the planet from the rest of us ?
2	i wonder_if you have a mission statement to “ ruin family holidays and destroy the planet ”
2	please contact me to arrange the refund of the 000_euros i have been unjustly charged and to explain what changes you are planning to make to the way you operate .
2	i wanted to switch because talk_talk '_s provided wireless_router is poor quality and they do not offer support on privately provided routers .
2	they failed to follow my request to terminate my line and it took about four months from original request for them to finally disconnect their line , whilst i had switched within two_weeks of request to my new provider .
2	talk_talk tried to charge me for the four months beyond my last usage of their service and in the end i have paid two of the four months having had threats of sending debt_collectors to my home .
2	i will never use them again
2	i purchased a sealey stw0000 torque_wrench from ffx , it was a very competitive price and arrived within a couple of days .
2	i can recommend this company for its friendly and quick service .
2	i had to contact the online sales support who sorted_out my query efficiently without_any fuss .
2	so a very good company to deal with , thank_you rich .
2	purchased computer memory , great value , quick delivery , brilliant communication , thanks !
2	theres_nothing off about offtek .
2	definitely use them again .
2	p - printer , i purchased a samsung ml0000nd mono_laser_printer , it was perfect , easy to set_up and well_packaged .
2	p - printer choice was made easier by the clear and detailed specification comparisons on their website .
2	p - price , most competitive on the web , includes postage so no_hidden_charges .
2	p - paypal , it is helpful that printerland accept_paypal
2	d - delivery , brilliant , i ordered over the weekend and received the item on tuesday , lightening delivery for a no extra_charge service .
2	q - quality of service , second to none .
2	i was telephoned on monday to confirm delivery on tuesday , no online_retailer has ever done this before .
2	i was emailed after delivery to ensure there were no_problems .
2	to sum_up , i can definitely recommend printerland whether it is for printers or printer_supplies and will use them again in the future .
2	oven broke whilst i was cooking dinner on thursday , finshed of in second oven .
2	checked out ao after dinner , ordered within 00_mins ( this is start to finish , including measuring the old model ) oven was delivered and fitted by 00 . 00 on saturday_morning , with the old one removed .
2	yes you pay for the extra services , however you don_'_t get the extra hasle .
2	previously used for washer_dryer - excellent also , aswell as microwave ( admit didn_'_t both with fitting on that one ... lol )
2	needed curtain hooks & purchased some at a local_store but needed more
2	went on line & found the same items 00_%_cheaper .

2	i purchased a coat for my wife for christmas .

2	its a shame because my wife has purchased desigual products through the house of frazer for some years .
2	cant_believe they are allowed to trade like this .
2	i ordered the korg midi_keyboard and to be honest was a bit_worried considering the negative_reviews i had seen - but they were dispelled .

2	thank_you

2	free 0st_class delivery , good price , nice juice .

2	as the payment page was loading i googled them and discovered their true_colours .
2	needless to say , i didn_'_t go_ahead with the purchase !
2	forced to give them a star by trustpilot .
2	not happy about that !!!!!
2	!
2	great service as usual .
2	have bought from you before and will be buying from you again - in about 0 minutes , as it happens !

2	i recently wanted to purchase a new digital_slr - having look at all the reviews around i settled on a nikon_d0000 with an additional 00 - 000mm_lens .
2	comparing_prices is relatively easy these days , and digitalrev . com were the lowest_price by a considerable_margin .
2	i placed my order , and had full tracking every_step of the way as my purchase progressed to my home address from_hong_kong all in less_than a week .
2	it arrived well_packaged and the order was 000_% correct .

2	i have now used shima_uma on two occasions and both_times have found them to be cheapest on price , good at communication and fast on delivery .
2	what more can you ask for ?
2	same as just about everybody_else .
2	ordered replacement saute pan lid at beginning of october .
2	they took the money immediately but failed to supply the item .
2	telephone line permanently busy but by continually redialling eventually got an answer and was advised that item would be delivered week_commencing 00 / 00 .
2	failed to arrive , unable to get through on phone in_spite of redialling and no response to online requests to contact me .
2	cancelled order online at beginning of november and expected automatic refund .
2	didn_'_t happen of course .
2	still couldn_'_t get through on phone and no response to email or written letter .
2	on advice from consumer direct will now send refund request by recorded delivery using all the right words .
2	don_'_t expect an immediate_response but will not give up on this without a fight .
2	i do not like being_ripped_off !
2	this is the second time i have used this site , and would recommend it fully .
2	webpage layout is good , very clear and easy to read .

2	will endeavour to use again for all my supplies i can '_t purchase locally .
2	hi double0 ,
2	it was so easy to arrange my tickets for rod_stewart .
2	they arrived when they said they would , it makes a change .
2	we '_ve_used xln telecom for a number of years , and were always skeptical_about the very bad_reviews we read about them .
2	however on cancelling one of our contracts with them , we '_ve be hit with what i can only describe as a scandalous hidden charge of £_000 . 00 .
2	apparently even if you give the proper notice to switch line provider , and after they have given you a mac_code , if the new provider takes over the service even 0 day early , they hit you with this charge .
2	i called xln today to complain , and all they did was fob me off with small_print .
2	these_guys have a very bad attitude_towards customers and thoroughly deserve all the bad_press that they get
2	paid £_000 up front to get our neff_dishwasher fixed , their local engineer a j p dom app ser of 0 the courtyard , saxon lane
2	bn00 0ql seaford , east_sussex tel 00000_000000 called to take a look .
2	didnt even bring out his tool box .
2	came back to carry out the repair over a week_later , and although having assured us the dishwasher was now working , left us with the original fault and a broken dishwasher .
2	we immediately complained to repaircair who promised that they would arrange for the engineer to return .
2	however having waited in for 0 days no engineer has_been and we are left with no repair and just broken_promises .
2	what a scam !
2	i closed my account with talk_talk and yet they still kept billing me - despite_numerous complaints .
2	ended_up having to cancel my direct_debit with the bank
2	they still owe me money - but its not worth the hassle trying to get it back
2	good product , good service , good value for money !
2	the aa temporary europe insurance team were great .
2	helpful and concise .
2	good value as well .
2	thanks , dave justice
2	very pleased with the service .
2	i think that sums it up !
2	bought some picks .
2	only place i could get them .
2	free , fast delivery .
2	good job !
2	just the job !
2	delivery failed for a freinds birthday .
2	00_hours_later still no joy and a further 00_hours until i '_m due to get a response - never again .
2	brought a suunto viper diving watch , came with all the added bits and pieces that i didnt get when i ordered one from the states a few_months back i . e .
2	full manual on cd , spare face cover and instruction_manual plus two free tank refills courtesy of aquanauts and some interesting info about their dive centre which i will_certainly look into joining .
2	great local company , fast service and very helpful , cant go_wrong with these_guys .
2	e_- buyer is a company i ' d recommend for a good range of products , at a fair price , with quick delivery , and good back - up , if needed .
2	i have now placed two_separate_orders with first0magnets .
2	both packages were delivered rapidly , and were well_packed , with a warning message about accidental injury included in the packet .
2	the magnets do what is expected of them , and they are robust and powerful .
2	the chrome_plating should protect them from atmospheric problems for a good while , but of course , i '_ve not had the items for long enough to prove or disprove this .
2	would i purchase from this supplier again ?
2	yes , if and when the need_arises .
2	i ordered several items , and they were all delivered together , a few_days_later , unlike another national_chain - who on a previous occasion sent one of the items one week , one the next , and the third a month later , then had the cheek to charge carriage three_times !
2	i '_ve not used them since .
2	fantastic and on time .
2	really pleased with service .
2	i was fed_up with the usual spring type mattresses that you can buy as , after a very short time , they would end up with hollows where you laid and become quite uncomfortable .
2	my friend_suggested that i try the memory_foam mattress and after finding these competitively_priced at the memory_foam warehouse , i decided to try one .
2	well i must_say , that i will not be going back to the conventional type mattress !
2	these memory_foam mattresses are very comfortable and shape thereselves around your body .
2	where i use to wake_up with back_ache and neck ache , i now wake_up refreshed and rested .
2	i cannot compliment this type of mattress enough and thank my frien very much for recommending them to me .
2	i now have a very peaceful nights_sleep .
2	try the memory_foam pillows !
2	i use to detsroy pillows within a couple of months , but this memory_foam pillow has now lasted me over a year and is still as comfortable as the day i purchased it .
2	zzzzzzzzzz
2	i visited braodband choices and found all i needed to know in less_than 0 minutes .
2	i like speedy things so this is good .
2	thanks broadband choices
2	asked a question about which product i needed to solve a problem .
2	the answer came back quickly and it was just what i wanted .
2	a few_days_later i ordered the product and some more that i needed and the process was easy and fast .
2	i got a delivery a few_days_later and all arrived in one package , which made it easy to store until i started work .
2	all in all a great service and a pleased customer .
2	thanks .
2	purchased new wheel_trims from them and within a few_days they had been delivered .
2	they came quicker_than i expected so it was a nice_surprise .
2	they look great on the car so i '_m very pleased .
2	the web_site is easy to navigate and i found what i was looking for easily and quickely .
2	thanks car parts !
2	i purchased from cartridge_shop as i liked the prices .
2	ink is really expensive and i have limited funds so it '_s the driving force for me with regard to whom i buy from .
2	i made the order , which was easy .
2	the goods came in good time and were of excellent quality .
2	fitted to my printer and all is now well .
2	thanks .
2	i will be using cartridge_shop again .
2	starting with the web_site ; the x 0 service enquiries i made ; the tracking_facility provided and then finally with the delivery the whole_operation was seamless , first_class and very professional .
2	so well_done to all involved .
2	i will most certainly recommend the partyrama experience to as many people as i can .
2	than you .
2	i used hellocanvas through an offer , and am_delighted with the result . i have a previous canvas photo from another company , but there is no comparison , the hellocanvas is far_superior . i selected a water scene from a recent_trip to venice , and friends & family comment on how great it looks , transforming a holiday snap into a canellto !
2	i called simply_paving to purchase a pallet of slabs to be delivered to my father - in - law '_s house .
2	the lady on the phone was very helpful .
2	it was no problem that the delivery address was different to the billing_address .
2	the day before the delivery , i received a call to say that the delivery was on and to ask if if was all ok .
2	so , all in all , a good service and an excellent price .
2	ordered monday , delivered thursday .
2	great
2	i wanted a diamond necklace for my partner , so i called dg , told them my budget , the design i liked and that i needed it on saturday at the latest ( this was tues lunchtime ).
2	they called me back within the hour with three suggestions for diamonds and some very good advice .
2	i selected one of these and had it set into a very unique necklace design .
2	i was promised delivery on the saturday_morning and so it was .
2	the delivery was well_packaged .
2	the necklace came with a lovely box and certificate .
2	i am extremely pleased with the neckalce .
2	the design is very special which really individualises the necklace and shows off the diamond .
2	the service was very good and i would highly_recommend diamond_geezer .
2	visited 0 shops looking for a certain lamp with no one having the right one in stock .
2	looked on lamps on line site and not only did they have the right lamp , the right colour , they were also the cheapest , so even with postage_charges i saved time and money .
2	excellent fast service , will use again .
2	i have been looking for a personalised label printer and came_across patlabels .
2	was exactly_what i was looking for , ordering was simple and goods despatched very promptly .
2	prices also reasonable and offer much_better value than of the shelf labels at my local_wholesaler .
2	will_definately_use again .
2	once again kenable has delivered in more than one way .
2	products were easy to order and all items in stock .
2	prices are still the best i have found and quality of items match .
2	excellent communication from couriers and all items delivered on time and in perfect_condition .
2	will_definitely use again for all my data needs .
2	i '_ve found cpc very handy for those normally hard to find gizmos and gadgets that i use for both work and personal use .
2	they are a one stop_shop for all electronic accessories and a whole lot more , all at excellent value for money .
2	regular mailouts handy but i do find website a bit_tricky to locate items on .
2	easy to book , best price i could_find .
2	ordered from a limited choice of seats & down loaded printed tickets , no_problems & had a great evening .
2	everything_went exactly as i expected .
2	great price & quick delivery , recently_purchased & delivered to our greek friend in crete
2	through car del_mar booked with avis who had a very nice med size toyota_corolla at micro car price
2	we ordered a new washing_machine from appliances_online as our other one had died in a cloud of smoke on the friday_morning .
2	we chose appliances_online because for value but also because they delivered free on a sunday .
2	we were promised a text on the sunday morning to confirm our delivery window , which duly_arrived on time .
2	we also got a call from the delivery driver to check we ' d received the text and to confirm the slot .
2	you ' re able to check online to confirm status of delivery including a delivery slot .
2	we were given 00 - 0 and at approx_0pm the van arrived .
2	washing_machine delivered to where we needed it and old one taken_away .
2	we didn_'_t take the option of the installation service .
2	hassle_free service - just what we wanted !
2	we had previously had appliance cover with british_gas but when they increased our premiums by about 00_% despite us not having made any claims we shopped_around and settled for the silver package from the warranty shop .
2	as luck would have it the heating_element in our dishwasher decided to breakdown so we looked to make a claim on our policy .
2	the t &_cs are such that you can '_t claim within 00 days of starting the policy .
2	although we weren_'_t happy about it we understood the reasons_why they have that clause .
2	so on day 00 of holding the policy we contacted the warranty shop to start a claim and that '_s when the fun started .
2	we went through a series of questions and at the end were told that because or claim was such a short time after the end of the claim period we would be contacted within " 0 - 0 working_days " by an assessor to go through more detail .
2	given that we had already waited 00 days we couldn_'_t understand_why this was necessary but reluctantly had to go along with it .
2	a couple of days_later i got a call from the assessor to arrange a " convenient " time to have an " interview " about our claim .
2	by this time i was starting to feel like a criminal .
2	the " convenient " time could only be scheduled between 0 :_00am - 0pm monday - friday and would last 00 - 00_minutes - hardly convenient when you work full time in the sort of job that has set times ( ie lunch_break !).
2	eventually i arranged a time which was by now a week after the original claim was registered .
2	the " interview " consisted of going through exactly the same details as i ' d already given the warranty shop .
2	fortunately it only lasted 00_minutes .
2	i was told they would submit a report and we ' d hear the outcome within " 0 - 0 working_days ".
2	0 days_later i received a call from an outfit called dvs .
2	at last i thought , our claim has_been accepted and this is to arrange for the repairs to be made .
2	wrong !!
2	this was a call to go through the same questions i ' d already been through directly with the warranty shop and the assessor .
2	by this time i was getting completely exasperated with the whole_process .
2	the sting in the tail with this call was that you now have to pay your excess of £_00 and that i would be contacted within " 0 - 0 working_days " for an engineer to call and assess our dishwasher .
2	i enquired as to whether we would get our excess back if the warranty shop wouldn_'_t honour our claim .
2	the person on the phone couldn_'_t answer and just kept referring me back to the warranty shop .
2	so once again i called the warranty shop .
2	i was told that if the engineer has_been to assess our dishwasher and it is decided that they will not honour our claim then we wouldn_'_t get our excess back as costs had been started .
2	the only way we could get our excess back was to cancel the engineer '_s visit .
2	i asked on what grounds our claim wouldn_'_t be honoured and one of them was " wear and tear ", so with cynical head on now , i said that i expected that this would be the conclusion of the engineer , especially as the dishwasher is nearly 0 years old .
2	by now completely fed_up with the whole_process , being made to feel as though i was making a fraudulent claim and still no nearer having our dishwasher repaired , we decided to withdraw our claim and cancel our policy with immediate effect .
2	since then i '_ve contacted a local domestic_appliance repair man who came round to assess the dishwasher on a saturday and will be able to do the repair on a tuesday_evening when he '_s received the part .
2	it '_s costing us £_000 but worth it to have a working dishwasher repaired at a convenient time for us .
2	we ' re also going to put the warranty shop premiums we ' re saving in a bank_account to cover any future repairs we need doing ( once in the last 0 years is not a bad strike rate !)
2	so the moral is if you want a cheap multi - appliance policy then the warranty shop will tick your box .
2	however , if you also want a hassle and stress_free claims process ( not an unreasonable request in my opinion ), then i would avoid the warranty shop at all costs
2	brilliant service
2	great to do_business with .
2	deliver what they say
2	brilliant service - cannot_fault it
2	i have read all the reviews regarding this company of morons and idiots .
2	it '_s the same old story , i ordered things on the 00 / 0 / 00 on their 00 hour delivery .
2	needless to say the items never arrived .
2	i visited their site to check the order status and low and behold it said order " pending "!!
2	i phoned them up , and you guessed it thy only had an answering_machine service .
2	so i decided to contact them via their online email form .
2	oh i never recived any confirmation_email as others have written in their reviews .
2	i recived an email eventually from some girl called karleen same as others ... seems like they only have one customer service rep .
2	anyhow , i cancelled the order as i saw some better vibrators on another site called love honey .
2	karleen said that i would get a refund within 0 days .
2	you guessed it i '_m still_waiting after 0_weeks .
2	i am now in the process of taking them to small_claims court to get my money back plus costs .
2	i would strongly_advise anybody not to purchase from these_people as you can hardly call them a company !!
2	they are a total load of bullshiters and shysters !!
2	!
2	this company provided me with a very good service and the delivery was prompt .
2	i would recommend anyone buying from this company if you are looking for safety_signs .
2	keep_up he good work viking_signs .
2	great service speedy despatch of goods .
2	if you ' re thinking of shopping here i fully recommend it , one of the best online services you '_ll get .
2	thank_you .
2	i have never_heard of this ' hermes ' delivery service before .
2	i ordered a poster from allposters . com who used this service .
2	i checked on their website and was supposed to arrive today .
2	judging_by the reviews i can expect to receive a terrible service .
2	i hear this company is owned by the germans .. i mean what do you expect .
2	they should stick to making volkswagens .. lol
2	this service is absolutely_terrible , i would not recommend anyone buying from this site .
2	allposters . co . uk is not a uk site , which had me fooled !
2	they are based in america but use the co . uk tag presumably to fool people in the uk .
2	i ordered two prints and a poster .
2	firstly they didn_'_t confirm the order by email which is usually customary with good companies .
2	then they got my address details wrong !
2	then when the order came it was incomplete !
2	then when they sent out the missing order they used an unknown delivery company called ' hermes ' who failed to deliver the item !
2	i mean what more can i say ... steer_well clear is my advice .
2	was very happy with the service , bought netbook for my son to help with his ' a ' levels .
2	one very happy son .
2	without a doubt , one of the best customer service based companies out there . great range of e_- cig '_s and extras , best prices , best forum_members and a great team led by abe and matt . hightly recommend doing_business with this company if your giving up smoking . im using them weekly
2	i ordered my tyres on thursday , £_00 cheaper_than nearest quote including fitting .
2	took the car to the local fitting_centre on saturday_morning ( 0 min drive from home ).
2	in and out in about 00 min .
2	second time i have used them and will_definitely be using them in future .
2	really good customer experience .
2	excellent cooker at a very good price , delivered by helpful and friendly delivery contractor , delivered exactly when they said it would be .
2	faultless service .
2	fantastic store with a superb range of guitars .
2	staff very knowledgeable .
2	excellent next_day delivery service who deliver when they say they will !
2	a while ago we used them , and a scream boxed set ( amongst other rejected items ) which were in very good condition were rejected on the grounds on " damaged artwork ."
2	they refused to return them , as they had been " recycled responsibly ".....
2	i have since heard that they recycle under the name " zoverstock " on amazon ... daylight_robbery in my opinion .
2	very quick , efficient service , consistently giving the best return .
2	this cover was requested for before_christmas since it was a gift .
2	i expected 0_weeks sufficient .
2	a week before_christmas i contacted specialised_covers and never got a reply by mail or telephone_call .
2	after christmas my opinions were expressed , we were advised the cover would be delivered asap , the next story was it went to the wrong_address , verbal apologies mean nothing in business , as far as i '_m concerned .
2	cut the cost or remove the deliver cost and one might consider returning .
2	i certainly wont return and would advise others against this company .
2	paid for 00hr delivery and received 0 days_later what can i say is it worth chasing no i wont go back im_afraid .
2	im very pleased with the delivery and products , what i ordered was delivered on time with no_problems .
2	haveing tried for almost a month on a similar site call the garden shop to be totally let_down twice and ill never go back garden for less will_definately get my custom again
2	thanks

2	ordered a ergo - tek mesh manager chair lunchtime yesterday .
2	colour was not in stock , but louise immediately sorted an_alternative out and the chair arrived before 0000 this morning already .
2	took 00_minutes to put_together and appears to be of great quality ( much_better_than the cheap ebay chair i bought last_year - that needed_replacing after only moderate occasional use ).
2	don_'_t think i will need the 0 years warranty , but great to have just in case anyway !
2	only just got back into home_brewing after over 00 years and good to find a shop with everything i need and also friendly , helpful advice as well .
2	we have to travel 00 miles to get here but well_worth it .
2	a " must " stop when we come to norwich .
2	sammie_taylor helped_me out today and got my parcel sent .
2	have used fragrancedirect before .
2	both_times the products have arrived well_packed and arrived within a couple of days of payment .
2	i would quite happily_recommend them on my present experiences .
2	purchased on the web , the piano was delivered on the agreed date .
2	it was the best packaged product i have ever received .
2	my wife and i assembled it in an_hour .
2	a solid_piece of furniture , beautifully constructed , the piano is a delight .
2	it did take a while to flatten the packaging and to dispose of it !
2	!
2	overall , i could not be_happier with the service and the product .
2	thank_you .
2	no_problems
2	does_exactly_what it says on the tin - service quick easy and money received in no time - would use them again and recommend them to anyone .
2	this was the first time i ordered from davpack and i have to say that the service and the products have been excellent .
2	no_qualms in recommending them and i '_ll happily be using them again .
2	the first order i places was fine , but the next one was awful .
2	there was a problem with delivery , then the items were out of stock , and i didn_'_t hear_anything for a week .
2	then they said that it would be sent the next_day , but it was delayed more .
2	i asked them why they never_let_me know about the stock issue and delays , but they just ignored the question and said it ' d be sent as soon as possible .
2	the advert says free next - day delivery , but when you do the order , it isn_'_t free .
2	i '_ve reported them to trading_standards , as they are obviously a bunch of cowboys .
2	not recommended .
2	ordered a new bog seat from trading_depot after mine developed a crack .
2	every time i sat down it pinched my bottom .
2	i could only put up with this for a short while .
2	arrived in no time and at the time specified .
2	needed a new battery for my 0000 ac 0 litre saloon .
2	found a reasonably_priced item on the tayna_batteries website and placed an order in late_afternoon .
2	within minutes , i received a helpful telephone_call from tayna regarding the battery fittings .
2	the battery was delivered the following_morning well_packaged and fully charged .
2	now that '_s what i call a service .
2	i '_m very happy with cult_pens .
2	i ' d recommend them
2	got my stanley level at a good price and quickly .

2	very happy with range and service
2	good kit at great prices .

2	i '_m very happy - excellent service
2	just ordered a controller for bosch_dishwasher .
2	it was out of stock , but they were excellent in keeping_me updated and responding to emails .
2	good price too .
2	would recommend .
2	a branch of primark recently opened near to where i live , i bought a 0 pack of underpants " jersey slip " but was unable to actually see them properly because of the packaging they were much skimpier than the picture on packaging showed and subsequently a very poor and uncomfortable fit .
2	another single pair ( most expensive i '_ve ever purchased ) bought at the same time were ok when bought , but a few washes later ( hand washed - never in very hot_water ) had lost all elasticity .
2	i had lost my receipt and one of 0 pack had been worn so i was unable to do much about it - although a trip to trading_standards has_been contemplated .
2	i would suggest anyone purchasing anything from primark keeps their receipt very safe , although i personally won_'_t be shopping there again .
2	i gave this a one star_rating because the staff were pleasant and there was no way not to give any stars at all .
2	so many things wrong - if using subtitles sometimes the subtitles start again mid programme so you ' re trying to read current subtitles and subtitles from before the break .
2	same sometimes happens with sound too .
2	tonight unable to watch corrie even_though i declare i '_m over 00 .
2	in all itv_player is a waste of time they could_learn a lot from bbc_iplayer .
2	yet another thing today monday 00th_jan the thumbnails are showing pictures of last weeks episodes .
2	( although the date says 00th_jan )
2	i had been let_down getting hold of a gretsch acoustic by another company ( gear0music ), and spotted that nevada had what i wanted in stock .
2	i ordered at about 00 : 00 in the afternoon and they had it with the courier by 0pm !
2	fantastic .
2	there was a slight_problem with parcelforce failing to find my house ( but looking at trustpilot reviews of parcelforce it doesn_'_t seem unusual for them to get things wrong !).
2	after emailing nevada who i believe got onto them , things started happening and i received my new guitar .
2	very well_packaged , great price , fantastic service .
2	i feel much_better buying from these_guys rather_than am * z * n too .
2	so thanks to all at nevada , i '_ll definitely use you again !
2	very pleased with my new akg_headphones .
2	they were cheaper_than anywhere_else and delivered very quickly - thanks music_matter i '_ll definitely deal with you again !
2	another order with free_samples and a free espn the mag subscription to boot !
2	i love their products and their animal paks price cannot be beat !
2	was looking for a keyboard , realized i needed to do some homework , and this site was extremely_helpful in assisting with the decision .
2	i ordered a telephone ( 00pds plus ) which was faulty on delivery - i returned it but have not been paid a refund ( over 00 months now ) despite many requests and reminders - they also trade as sales @ ezstyle . co . uk
2	i would advise anyone not to buy from them
2	i ordered an outdoor_table_tennis_table ( cornilleau_sport one ) for urgent delivery - ordering_process very quick and smooth - it arrived at the stated time on the stated day with no_problems at all .
2	great product and already having lots of fun .
2	jm
2	do not do_business with this company - they supplied faulty goods and when returned did nothing to replace or refund - they dont answer their customer service telephone line nor do they respond to email enquiries .

2	very easy transaction fitting_center only 0 miles_away and a convenient time .
2	cannot recommend highly_enough .
2	easy site to use , very well explained .
2	wow .
2	dell sent me a ' no reply accepted ' email to say the pc would be delivered by courier in next week or so .
2	next_day 00 / 00 / 00 the courier sent me their first contact , a ' no reply accepted ' email " your dell order is scheduled to arrive between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
2	please arrange for someone to be there throughout this time - as we cannot be more specific about the time of delivery .
2	as your order is already on its way we regret it '_s too late to change the following details :
2	0 . delivery date
2	0 . delivery address
2	0 . order details "
2	i tracked down someone at dell to complain at this attitude and to say that i ' d have someone available 0 - 0 : 00 but it would have been nice to have proper contact with the courier not this ultimatum .
2	and that roads around here are badly flooded so it ' d be an idea for them to ring us anyway to discuss access .
2	the delivery was fine , but this sort of attitude suggests a lack of customer_care .
2	mine was a bulky ebay purchase , a land_rover truck cab .
2	i emailed several couriers who advertise on ebay , but for this sort of item which was not in a neat box , and was over 0 . 0m_long and weighed about 00kgs ... well 0 out of 0 replied , quoting £_000 and £_000 !
2	i then tried shiply and another courier wholesaler .
2	by the time the other one had got the first quote to me shiply had sent 0 !
2	the first one was £_00 total , i took it , slightly_worried i might get poor service .
2	far from it , the courier liam uses an ipad on 0g so can ( and does ) respond to emails regularly , from anywhere .
2	his communication was exemplary , and he was very pleasant for both seller & me to deal with .
2	i will use him for future quotes , failing which i will again use shiply ... unless its a small package .
2	well , i '_m collecting a jukebox from essex back to somerset & for that sort of delicate thing i did decide to do it myself , perhaps wrongly .
2	very easy to order with this company , and as i '_ve said i would reccomd them without_hesitation .
2	would use this company again without_hesitation .
2	the whole_thing was very efficient .
2	i received a quote for a part and ordered it at 0 . 00 p . m . on wednesday and it arrived at my house at 0 a . m . on friday .
2	that is what i would call wonderful service !
2	they were prompt and bang on time with their response and the accuracy of the dates given .
2	all_round good work .
2	if more companies worked as good as this the economy would soon recovery .
2	i found travel house quoting excellent business class fares online last saturday .
2	when i called i spoke to tim morrison , who was friendly , polite and pretty efficient .
2	he gave_me his direct line number , but called me regularly to let_me know what was happening with my booking .
2	he completed the transaction today by reserving the seats .
2	i expect to be calling tim again when i next need to book flight tickets and on the basis of my experience would recommend him to anyone .
2	shopping at suppliment warehouse is really is like breathing fresh_air :
2	you always find somethig new

2	great service from knowledgeable experts .
2	great products at highly competitive_prices ( the lowest i could_find ).
2	delivery prompt and very efficient .
2	so much so , it felt_like a truly personal service !
2	i needed a good lazer printer and although i had one in mind the excellent salesman gave_me a great overview on the possible alternatives which i found very informative .
2	after choosing the best printer for my requirements the delivery was the very next_day !
2	this company knows what its talking_about and i would have no_hesitation in recommending them .
2	rob , who i dealt_with was enthusiastic and very informative . he called me back promptly the following_day so we could go through the booking and gave_me some important advice for when we collect our cars in orlando in 0 week time , for the first timer collecting a car if you have the gold package insurance don_'_t let the desk talk you into buying extra_insurance , your covered and believe me i '_ve been got before years_ago , when kids are running around your feet and everyone '_s tired , don_'_t give in to the seller .
2	fast efficient accurate service and delivery - good thoughtful communication - quality product at good price .
2	really fast accurate service - good quality goods
2	just what they offered - right on time - good price - and they sent me a text to say they had been delivered

2	i have bought , p / x and now sold to mpb , i have always been satisfied with prices and service , good communication and fast payments makes this company highly_recommend to anyone looking for camera gear .
2	its brilliant but you have to double_check when clicking for your orders .
2	i have clicked for one item then end up with 0 then its seems hard to get your money back .
2	i am still_waiting for 00 . 00 pounds .
2	then i ordered sunglasses clicked for one then two wowcher codes were sent to me when i only wanted one !!
2	so now i need a refund for £_00 to me that '_s a lot of money i am waiting for .
2	when you order and order the correct no of items / wowcher codes you want its brilliant .
2	good quality goods .
2	fast delivery .
2	brilliant service all_round , our son is so pleased with his ultra_thin laptop for uni . company highly_recommended .

2	some of the places have been very good and very low_cost
2	after another shop let_me down with no stock , taunton_leisure wer able to confirm that they had stock and i got my new boots 0 days_later .
2	i needed a new fire door .
2	although the website said delivery 0 - 00 days , topclass were able to find one at one of their stockists and get it delivered the next_day .
2	thanks for making the extra effort .
2	edecks were recommended to me you know , i thought that they would be just like any other on - line company , mediocre and failing to deliver on their promises .
2	but actually no , that was not the case ; i was really pleasantly_surprised by the way i was dealt_with , the on - line buying process was as easy as it could be and delivery , following the security_checks , was made to me almost the next_day by a very helpful chap_who knew_exactly_what he was doing .
2	you should try them for decking or other supplies , they really do offer an outstanding service .
2	all i would say is that if you did not deliver an excellent service , i would not keep returning to your site .
2	i have made countless purchases through lenstore and that is testament to how good you are .
2	this is exactly_what i wass looking for and delivered very quickly , so i was not left_hanging_around waiting for my order .
2	couldn ` t believe_how quickly the outfits arrived !
2	tried them on straight_away and couldn ` t stop laughing .
2	can ` t wait to got out in them , ha !
2	ordered a heritage solid_oak toilet_seat which was considerably_cheaper on this site than competitors .
2	delivery was prompt and in the evening when i was in which was perhaps a bit of luck .
2	i found the whole_process to be very efficient and staff were extremely_helpful .
2	the end product was wonderful and i would certainly use the service again .
2	my daughter and her half - wit boyfriend loved the portrait .
2	cheers .
2	item delivered when promised ; hifi_tower sent useful dpd parcel tracking_link which announced arrival to a one - hour_window .
2	great speakers , well packagesd , exactly as_described and good value
2	service was very quick and professional but a bit surprised they could not help quickly with hire car had to go though my insurance company just means i now dealing_with two companies apart_from that i would recommend them .
2	well i must_say the title no how is about right for the service dept as they have no idea of how to deal with a customer or tell the truth about a repair .
2	i took my computer in last saturday as i had a problem paid my £_00 and also paid £_00 for anti_virus under there recomedation and was told computer would be ready that afternoon .
2	i then receieved a call to say it would be sunday morning to collect from store and what documents would i like saved .
2	somebody was telling porky pies as my wife goes and picks_up the tower unit and i plug it in guess_what nothing had been done .
2	take it back to store yes we will look at it and get back to you monday come afternoon nothing so i have to ring and guess_what the hard_drive is gone .
2	what a joke nobody can tell you the truth .
2	the service is disgusting as i was told i would receive a call this morning guess_what nothing .
2	all i can say is buy you pc etc from somebody_else as i will be doing in the future and also i will be recommending this to other people and buisness .
2	trevor dodds

2	great product , great company , great correspondence from_start to finish .
2	was truly an experience to order , quick and easy to do and saved me money what more do you want from an internet experience .

2	it was dispatched the same day as i ordered it and arrived quicker_than i thought it would .
2	fantastic company 0_star

2	this was a replica of the previous order where they were keen to identify exactly_what product is most suitable .
2	thanks

2	was told that there was no way that my iphone could be unlocked by a certain telecoms company ; looked at this site and was suspicious although site looks professional and theres a phone number with contact address .
2	gave it a go ... and to my amazement within 00_hours i had an unlocked_iphone 0 .
2	cracking service .....

2	i cannot_praise this company enough i had been looking for some furniture on google and this company came up they were nearly_half price to what i had seen .
2	from ordering and recieveing the goods i had recieved 0 emails to comfirm and status of order the goods recieved in 00 days the driver rang the day befor to confirm the delivery date and time was ok , the driver was brilliant very helpful and curtious i cannot_praise them enough will_defo buy from this company again
2	many_thanks for a all_round brilliant service
2	good website easy to use .
2	prompt delivery of order .
2	i have used cpc for the past 0 years having previously used ard who they took over .
2	there accounts_dept , sales staff have always been extremely_helpful and resolved the few minor problems i have had .
2	the one miinor thing that is not very good is when they send orders by royal_mail over whom they have no control and who are particulary bad in my area .
2	all in all i would class their service and stock availabillity as excellent and give them a score of 0 out of 00 and have no_hesitation in recommending them to everyone .
2	one little gripe , although their new trade_counter is superb i find the queing system tedious and time_consuming .
2	bert morris
2	very satisfied customer

2	i ordered a pair of north_face trousers which arrived within 0 days , unfortunately i ordered the wrong_size , sent them back and not only did the replacement arrive by return post , a very helpful member of staff phoned me before despatch to check i was sure of the size i wanted .
2	well_done .
2	booked on friday to collect monday . nobody turned_up then recieved email_saying nobody here when they arrived , which was nonsense as i was here all day . re - booked for tuesday , same thing , re - booked wednesday , online_chat guy said they couldn_'_t find my address , i said they have my phone number , so please call me !!
2	he said the couriers don_'_t have ' works phones ' and are under no obligation to use their own .. i just couldn_'_t believe it !!
2	the guy on the chat - window said he ' d leave a message for the depot manager , but this took two attempts without_success . i finally phoned customer_support and they eventually collected the parcel on friday , one week_later .
2	i ' d been sending apologetic e_- mails to my customers all week , keeping them informed of events , and fortunately they were ok about it .
2	it would have only taken one phone_call to me and this would '_ve been sorted within minutes , but with such appalling communication it dragged on all week .
2	i find it unbelievable that a business can operate in this manner , let_alone be successful !
2	the guy found our house ok , even_though we share the same postcode with around 00 other properties scattered around this very rural_area . he was friendly and efficient , many_thanks .
2	i was sceptical at first , but i '_m glad to say i was pleasantly_surprised by how good panamoz was .
2	they had a stock_shortage on the lens i ordered which they quickly told me about - they did everything they could and i only got the lens a couple of days_later than_expected .
2	delivery was fast and everything was in good order , for an excellent price .
2	i paid by_bacs to get a slightly better price and had no_problems .
2	they do seem to have stock issues , but that aside , i '_m just waiting now for another lens to come in stock so i can order again !
2	so , i '_ve had not one but two issues this morning with dpd .
2	one was a delivery for a fridge ( 00000000 ) where they decided to leave a card but felt they didn_'_t have the time to bother buzzing my door .
2	i specifically took the day off to wait for them ; i was sat in my flat all morning , dead quiet .
2	no tv , no loud background noises , in a rural_area where all you can hear are the birds tweeting and the odd car .
2	after a short while i decided to go downstairs to check my mailbox , and surprise_surprise an attempted delivery card !
2	i called the retailer ( fridgefreezerdirect ) and fortunately they '_ve been really good and managed to arrange_redelivery this afternoon so i haven_'_t wasted my entire day .
2	the retailer suggested they ' re supposed to * actually * attempt delivery and are obligated to wait for 00_mins at each address or they really get in trouble .
2	i heard they keep gps logs so i wonder what story the evidence tells ?
2	they tried to suggest my buzzer may be on the blink , but i went right down and tested it out .
2	sure_enough it '_s loud enough i can hear it from outside , so i can only_assume the driver doesn_'_t know how buttons work - god_knows_how they figured out how to operate a vehicle .
2	then to add to the confusion , i was awaiting yet another delivery from amazon via_dpd ( 00000000 ) and no card this time , just sitting here quietly and an email popped up saying nobody was home .
2	great , so how am i reading about it in my flat ??
2	i got several emails before the " attempt " saying " be sure you ' re in !"
2	and " your delivery '_s going to be at this time in the morning ", so i was sat there ready in wait , but this driver decided it wasn_'_t worth their time either .
2	i suppose they ' re sharing efficiency tips or too_busy doing doughnuts in a carpark somewhere ?
2	i rang up amazon immediately to try and get them to redeliver , but they couldn_'_t reach the driver and who_knows if they ' re actually going to try again today .
2	if they can sort it out by the end of the day they will have redeemed_themselves somewhat , but i '_m really not impressed .
2	i '_ve had issues like this with dpd '_s " attempted deliveries " last christmas as well .
2	edit_: driver for the fridge delivery just got in contact and he '_s hopefully going to deliver this afternoon , fingers_crossed .
2	i '_ll update my review as i see progress .
2	edit0 : just got my amazon delivery , the guy claims he came this morning and was outside ringing the bell for 0 minutes .
2	i '_m not convinced but i '_m happy i got my parcel today .
2	edit0 : my fridge has arrived !
2	it '_s unfortunate that i had to take both the afternoon and morning off rather_than just the morning , but at_least everything was sorted_out within the day .
2	i still have no idea what happened in the morning , but both amazon and fridgefreezerdirect dealt_with the matter well and arranged redeliveries with dpd quickly and without charge , which is better_than many other couriers in my experience .
2	excellent web_site - easy to find the correct_memory for my motherboard .
2	very quick dispatch and delivery - and stopped the ever_increasing wait for things to respond on my computer
2	bought bf0 limited with b0k was sent 0 keys immediately after payment both in use .
2	was given a new bf0 key a couple of days_later , however it took a bit longer to get the b0k , told me it was sent in original email after purchase .
2	took a couple of attempts to get across that key was already in use .
2	overall i can say from my experience they won_'_t rip you off , its just a shame that when you buy a game in good faith the keys are already in use and its not an immediate replacement , you have to wait a couple of days .
2	ordered 0 pairs of glasses , one yves saint laurent , for £_00 . 00 !!
2	amazing .
2	arrived very quickly and delighted with the end_result .
2	can '_t fault the service , my camera arrived today as did the accessories .
2	the internet site is very user_friendly .
2	you also get a clue as to what else you might need to order or what you may have forgotten to order .
2	that '_s because of the ' other people who bought this also bought these ' prompt that shows during the ordering_process .
2	products are reasonably_priced and the item arrived in no time at all .
2	great service and i will_definitely check on this site first in future .
2	ordered a petzl attache 0d carabiner .
2	arrived within a couple of days .
2	great product , great price & good service .
2	buy with confidence .
2	it ’_s great to see a company compete with amazon and beat them of price .
2	i expect they probably beat them on paying their proper share of uk tax too ?
2	give them a try .
2	goods came when advised , well_packed and first_class service
2	i have bought a few items from webtogs over the last 0 years .
2	the last time i ordered they were discounting some lines quite heavily .
2	in addition they were offering a one off further discount if you entered a promotional_code .
2	i messed_up entering the code and was therefor charged the pre promotional rate .
2	when i realised my mistake i emailed them on a saturday_night .
2	by the time my boots had arrived ( very quickly ) they had credited me with the extra discount .
2	great service , good value .
2	order made and completed extremely quickly
2	the vent i ordered was promptly delivered but with 0 of the 0 components badly broken and parts missing .
2	that was not plumbingforless ltd fault , perhaps ( though the packing was minimal ).
2	the failure to respond to my emails asking what will happen to replace it is very disappointing .
2	i was very pleasantly_surprised to have a call from the us within minutes of ordering , to confirm the order details and ensure shipping details were correct .
2	shipping was rapid and highly efficient .
2	i ordered a antec 000 case on the wednesday_night !
2	to great surprise my order was delivered on the friday_afternoon !
2	i '_m very happy !
2	0_0
2	i would recommend and definetely use again grippy . co . uk to change any tyres .
2	they are a quality fast clean professional friendly service .
2	suntransfers were waiting for us as we walked through the airport to take us to our hotel , they text the day before our departure to confirm our return pickup and arrived 0 minutes ahead of schedule .
2	both drivers were very helpful and courteous an excellent company and would recommend them to anyone .
2	we booked to tenerife with no_problems it was an excellent hotel .
2	we booked flights , hotel , and transfers all separately travel_republic gave_us a good price for the hotel and it was a smooth_transaction .
2	easy to use and delivered beyond_expectations !
2	brilliant
2	having already been stung by one online company ( balance_optics ) i was really apprehensive_about trusting another , but i am_glad i did rx_sport where a pleasure to do_business with , easy to use ordering system , the communication & customer service was first_rate , and the delivery of the lenses was fast which exceeded my expectations .
2	i highly_recommend rx_sport they are trustworthy , reliable and above all honest
2	i have discovered today via a competitor that balance_optics are no_longer trading but their website is still up and they are taking orders and people '_s money , but have no_intention of for filling any orders therefore do not buy from this company
2	i am_currently using paypal to get a refund and i '_m hopefully paypal will also block them from using their service going forward
2	i '_ve_used event_tyres for car tyres several_times and always been happy with the service .
2	when i needed caravan tyres i decided to see if they could help i received first_class advice and next_day service from event .
2	the fitter did a first_class job i would recommend them to anyone
2	ordered replacement batteries for three specialist watches .
2	these were delivered next_day .
2	tested the batteries and found them to be fresh and fully charged .
2	although you can buy slightly_cheaper on the web , i prefer top quality products that i can trust with great service at a competitive price ... the choc was a nice_touch too !
2	will_definitely orde from this company again .
2	i ’_m an individual who ’_s thorough in his research , have high expectations and a “ right first time ” philosophy .
2	i researched my local suppliers and the online market extensively before selecting tayna .
2	their online technical_info was excellent and informative .
2	pricing was competitive including delivery , but it was the positive customer comments that sold me !
2	my delivery lived_up to all my expectations ... extremely well_packed , delivered on time and the battery was exactly as specified .
2	my complete online buying experience from tayna was perfection .
2	thanks to and congratulations tayna .
2	phoned up friday got freepost_bag saturday posted monday got money on wednesday now that '_s what i call service well_done mazoma
2	fast , efficient and good value .
2	excellent service .
2	only one suggestion , delivery date to be made availble when ordering , ( although my order came very quickly )
2	having placed an order for food and cystease , i realised that 0 days had past and that i had recieved nothing .
2	i emailed my complaint , chasing devilery only to be advised that as they had no stock of cystease they had not sent anything out , awaiting new supplies .
2	at this point , we were out of both items and desperately required replenishment , therefore i cancelled the order , requested my paypal credit and that all my personal_data was removed from their system to prevent any unwanted correspondance , with a confirmation_email when complete .
2	a further 0 days_later , after ordering and recieving goods from a competant supplier , no email , no credit .
2	contacted them again and again requested the above .
2	suggestion , your more professional opposition have systems which advise if there is no stock when ordering or at_least will email you the next_day .
2	i have received my goods quicker with free delivery before you have even bothered to rectify your errors .
2	suggest any pet_owners use " vet uk "
2	actually , i am old enough to remember ...
2	we waited and waited for the microsoft search_engine to fnd anything similar to what you wanted ....
2	hail google !
2	visited last night , a disgusting experiance , stinking , sticky , smelly carpets , uncomfortable seats ( superiour seats !!)
2	game machines dumped inside next to door , very poorly managed .
2	did my wife take me in ?
2	what a horrible experiance .
2	rubbish on the shelves , with misserable desperate people doing their weekly_shop , for anything cheap .
2	not for me .
2	i uppose that there is room for all in the market , but i prefer to pay for quality and good taste , ok yes , i am a snob .
2	only thing i can agree on , is the rather stupid people on the tv programme , who dont understand_why they have missed their flight when the plane is still there .... berks !
2	thats just what i thought the last time i had to go .... only because it was still open .
2	they dont stock many brands , or they are " out " of everything you need .
2	it is a good place however to meet strange smelly locals if your that way inclind .
2	i have read some of the reviews from disappointed people and am amazed ....
2	i have always found debs full of very helpful staff and excellent products .
2	what amazes_me is that i find a bargain , go to the till and am told that the price is even less , due to another sale !
2	keep it up debs , especially in this competitive time with unethical shops around you .
2	i have been shopping at morrisons since they bought out safeway in 0000 .
2	they keep a reasonable stock of brand items unlike_some , but we have seen them change their management style .
2	they now stock shelves during the day , or rather during the busiest times possible , rather_than at night , which is very frustrating trying to dodge around them .
2	in addition , it used to be a " nice " place , but the till staff are under so much pressure now , they dare not speak or smile ...
2	having bought many items through amazon , i am amazed to reaport absolutely no_problems !
2	good speedy service at reasonable prices , keep it up .
2	sorry , had real bad problems with their service and when you try to sort , you speak to someone going through the questions on the card , like an eastern robot ...... moved to o0 .
2	i grew up believing that the bbc was the best service on the telly , although at the time there were only thre stations !
2	now , raher than being the best , with actual news rather_than dramatised gossip , they have decided to try to compete with the other channels for worst programmes transmitted , oh and then repeated ..............
2	excellent service , good deals , great signal ( most of the time ) what more can you ask for ?
2	i have traveled with thomson three_times now , usually prefering to travel with kuoni .
2	their staff at the shop and resorts are extremely professional and very helpful and even ......... pleasant !
2	on the aircraft though they fall back into the ignorant misserable look .....
2	i have never shopped at primark and never ( hopefully ) will .
2	dont people think about where this stuff comes from ?
2	have you thought how long it takes to make the fabric , make the shirt / jeans then theres the shipping cost from which ever poor country it comes from oh and transport in th uk to the shop and all for £ 0 or £ 0 ??
2	?
2	what are the children making them getting paid ???
2	one or two bowls of rice ?
2	come on people , get some ethics and principles or look the words up to know what they mean .....
2	appauling service from both the shop and tellysales staff .
2	mobile replaced eventually , with another one that didnt work .
2	never had a problem with o0 or vodafone .
2	again , found the special dog diet_food cheapest on the web .
2	they sent emails on delivery progress and the package arrived bang on time .
2	had a problem arranging_collection of a parcel i had booked for collection and then delivery to me but the guy at the other end had no printer for the label .
2	tried p0go on the ' live_chat ' and got operator sammie_taylor , who rebooked the service on a ' no - label - required ' basis .
2	sorted !
2	thanks sammie .
2	order received with in 0 day , very pleas with there service ,
2	arrived the day early than i thought ,
2	easy , navigatable website to select appropriate cartridges with full product description , whole_process through to confirming order is a breeze !
2	order placed late_afternoon and although standard delivery specified , the package arrived the following_day .
2	emails keep you informed of the delivery process .
2	i have used this company many_times and the service is always good .
2	i use the re - conditioned cartridges for my epson_photo px000w and have had no_problems to date .
2	the print quality is equivalent to the full ( exhorbitant ) priced epson product .
2	hi , as someone_who is accustomed to buying games and dvds from amazon , i was prompted to look for an_alternative source , when the product i was looking for was was expensive .
2	i found videogame box through google_search and was attracted_by the competitive price , however , i was unsure_about dealing_with ( for me ) an unknown retailer .
2	anyway , i can confirm that i am_delighted with the price of the product , the prompt delivery and product quality .
2	in future , i will look at videogames site whenever i am looking for games .
2	happy to recommend them .
2	bought the corner_sofa and separate footstool .
2	it is amazing in our room , completely changed the look , really comfy and the whole family can sit together - a perfect home_cinema .
2	having great fun .
2	as for delivery , no issues , guys brought it in carefully , unwrapped it and put it together , super quick .
2	my daughter has had a few uglies , i chose this on for her swim club and she_loves it .
2	win_win for both of us .
2	i have never been disappointed with chocolates now and i ahve been using them for some 00 years .
2	i am in hm forces and to be able to order easily in limited time and have the chocolates delivered on time is one lessworry .
2	great chocolates , great services and delivered in good time with nice wrapping .
2	they have always been well received by my wife , mum , sisters and daughers on special occassions and being_able to hand pick is great fun - even two of the same .
2	also storing the different addressees is handy when time is tight online .
2	more than happy with chocolates now .
2	very happy with table , no_dramas with assembly .
2	adjustable fit so can even out the patio slabs . considering i was going to buy the full set , the table at £_000 was great and buy the chairs another time .
2	no issues with garden_xl or delivery .
2	very pleased and good purchase .
2	i was impressed by the quickness of the delivery of my order . it arrived well_packed undamaged and was as i ordered
2	royal_mail lost my order emailed for replacement and one was sent one out by ups package arrived damaged but goods were ok apart_from the lid on chain lube was cracked .
2	i like sportsbikeshop but they need to have a word with there couriers
2	first of all i recieved great help and advice on which kit to buy .
2	got free 00hr delivery .
2	excellent after sales service on how to get the best out of the kit . would highly_recomend .
2	will be getting more gear next year .
2	purchased 0 blinds to date both vertical and roman .
2	every one fitted_perfectly , extremely well made and excellent quality .
2	0st .
2	class .
2	needed some new sunglasses & having just been to the opticians had a new prescription .
2	it was suggested i needed varifocals so as to enable smooth reading of dials & gauges whilst driving & also enable long sight .
2	the optician prices were far to expensive for me so i decided to search the internet for vfm , it did not take too long to see glases0you web_page .
2	the purchase was easy & the process of ordering easy , prompted at all_stages .
2	having placed my order a spare frame was sent through the post ( free to keep ) to wear whilst taking a photo of my head to send off to them to enable my eye pupil_distance to be correctly sized .
2	my glasses arrived less_than a week_later less_than 00 days in total .
2	i am so pleased with them , they are just what i needed at a price affordable .
2	thanks glasses0you , will be back when needed .
2	stu white

2	now got x 0 tanks working , oil & financial payback ( fuel reduction due to bulk deliveries in my area ) to use against my next order .
2	was looking for a chiminea to finish our new pagoda patio off , but it needed to fit in with the stone benches & circle , so started looking via_google .
2	gardening 0 less was one of the first ads up so looked in & found just what we wanted , the bonus being it was on offer .

2	just before_christmas 0000 i placed an order for a new bass_guitar , plus an amp and some other assorted bits of kit , and it all arrived on the specified day , at the right time .
2	one small item wasn_'_t in stock , but gear0music quickly sent that on to me as soon as they had one in stock , and that too arrived with me the day after the rest of my stuff !
2	very pleased with gear0music and will use them again with no_hesitation .

2	i '_ll definitely be using hottub diy again .
2	after my initial tentative enquiry via_email , my early reservations ( re mail order on such a major purchase ) were dispelled .
2	joe mckenzie is a superb communicator , a very fair negotiator , his_enthusiasm for watches is infectious and his_knowledge is extensive .
2	he and his_team share common values of honesty , integrity , attention to detail ( the accuracy of descriptions and images on the xupes website is particularly impressive ).
2	i am now the proud_owner of my ultimate watch , a jlc master compressor extreme tourbillon after a most enjoyable buying experience .
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending xupes and i look_forward to doing_business again in the future .

2	if you need a site you can trust and provides great prices then this is the one to use .
2	they have everything for orlando on there and we used it to buy disney magic your way tickets .
2	these cannot be bought from the disney uk site as they only really let you choose 0 , 00 or 00 day passes .
2	as we are mixing disney with universal studios we wanted something more flexible .
2	the tickets arrived in just a few_days .
2	highly_recommended !
2	purchased new washer - dryer and they had by far the best price .
2	it was delivered quickly and arrived exactly at the promised time .
2	we arranged to have old machine collected and whilst driver was not aware of this on their paperwork they still took it away .
2	so the one thing company could do is to perhaps co - ordinate the collection of old machines a but better .
2	overall an excellent experience - we were even able to observe a video review of the washer_dryer via the company website .
2	good memory at a good price and fast delivery
2	often travel leeds /_bradford to malaga .
2	good flight times , baggage allowances , pre booked seats and no queues at check in always make it it a pleasant_experience .
2	i was looking for a waistcoat in all the high_street_shops to no_avail even the ones that normally sell them had nothing either to my liking , price or any significant stock of sizes .
2	while_browsing the internet i came_across mytuxedo and was really impressed with the range of formal_wear .
2	i found a waistcoat which was so reasonably_priced , i thought it was either a typo or was bound to be out of stock but checked the stock issue and found a cravat to match so i ordered them online thinking that it was going to be of passable quality to go under a jacket .
2	i placed my order at 0 . oclock friday_evening and it arrived in the post the following_morning .
2	when i opened the well packet parcel i was agreeably impressed by both the quality of both items , and the price .
2	i personally feel you get more than your money '_s worth in cut alone .
2	i have in the past spent much more on inferior goods , and have already_recomended your company to friends and relations , as i work in the theatre i am frequently attending first nights and royal galas for which we need to wear formal attire i shall definately be using your sevice again .
2	i have always wanted a proper tuxedo and now feel with your prices it is within my reach .
2	thank_you so much
2	i have ordered two_pairs of raybans from selectspecs in the last three_months .
2	the pair were for me , a saving of 00_% from the high_street .
2	great price , but ... they took about 0_weeks to come , and then they werent the right fitting .
2	as they were varifocals , i put this down to the fact that you really do need to go to a high_street_optician , to get an accurate fitting .
2	i did send them an old pair of glasses to aid measurement .
2	i will have to get the lens changed , and pay the high_street price .
2	selectspecs offered to changed them for a a fixed lens pair , but i declined .
2	the other pair , for my son , were perfect .
2	very pleased with the price , and service .
2	three_weeks as_opposed to five .
2	product as_described well priced and arrived on the day given .
2	it was also well_packaged .
2	will_definately_use pet_supermarket again .
2	ordered 0 remanufactured hp carts but all 0 would not work with either of my printers .
2	have e_- mailed but no response .
2	will no be using them again and would not recommend .
2	this was my second order with blackcircles , both with the broadbridge heath garage .
2	my first order was from a recommendation from the rac .
2	my recent -- second -- order was based on my satisfaction & confidence from my first experience .
2	this included the evident value for money and quality .
2	on both_occasions , service was prompt and efficient .
2	the website is easy and clear to use , and the options are clearly_displayed along with their prices .
2	making a choice is easy .
2	i had just returned from a 0 - week trip to india , and needed tyres urgently .
2	my appointment was in 0 days from placing my order .
2	the email response from blackcircles , confirming the time of day , came promptly .
2	the service from the garage went beyond the call of duty .
2	some of the wheel_nuts were rusted .
2	the garage gave excellent advice , and without_prompting , ordered new wheel_nuts for me , and without_any fuss , rescheduled my appointment for 0 days_later .
2	the fitting was speedy , and on time .
2	i have already_recommended blackcircles to friends , and will , without_hesitation , use their service next time .
2	probably the quickest delivery i '_ve ever had from any internet company .
2	ordered the item in the afternoon it was with me the following_morning and that wasn_'_t even with next_day delivery .
2	the website is one of the best laid_out i '_ve seen .
2	the product itself was superb a scott arx helmet .
2	if your thinking of buying a new helmet , don_'_t bother looking at anything_else .
2	brilliant quality at a brilliant price and the looks to match .
2	all in all a great transaction , thank_you pedalon .
2	you will be the first_port of call in future .
2	oh_yes and the helmet was cheaper here than anywhere_else by a big margin .
2	needed a quote for a replacement bike for the insurance company after having two of my road_bikes nicked from the garage .
2	wiggle responded within half an_hour with full quote , brilliant .
2	very good indeed - i bought 0 chests of drawers - beautifully made , proportioned and designed .

2	i found this company via_google and thought i would give them a try .
2	the webiste is pretty clear and easy to use .
2	i placed my order and the magents arrived promptly and were well_packed and of very good quality .
2	our production units will be using these magnets .
2	i am very pleased to have found this source .
2	i have dealt_with europc for many_years_now and have always received prompt assistance in finding the best deal for me .
2	i only ever buy one or two machines at a time but david my account_manager is always ready to find the exact machine that i want .
2	the latest dell precision was needed very urgently and despite the pc only coming into stock in the afternoon , it was shipped that night so that i could have it ready for my new employee the nex day .
2	i can '_t ask for better service than that and save_money as well !
2	i recently_purchased a high end pair of beyerdynamic_headphones - i called hifiheadphones in advance and talked through my options - they reccommended a pair of headphones much_cheaper_than my original decision - although in the event i went for the expensive ones anyway .
2	the products ( headphones and amplifier ) arrived following_day and to cap it all they sent me a lollipop !
2	the hifiheadphone website was simply the most informative and clear headphone review and advice site i found after much research - i reccommend this shop without_hesitation .
2	i bought this runner for my caravan and its great , it stays where its put and looks wonderful .
2	should have bought it ages_ago , it makes all the difference to the look of the caravan .
2	very good to buy from and quick postage will_definitely use again .
2	thanks for the quick delivery , and the really excellent communication .
2	you kept me aware of the order progress , despatch , and even a reminder on the day of delivery .
2	goods just as expected , nothing to fault .
2	no_problems with my purchase of a pc component , it arrived in a few_days .
2	fantastic service next_day delivery perfect will be using viovet often thanks very much
2	i ordered this product late one evening at it was on my doorstep within 00_hours .
2	superb quality and excellent service
2	ordered over £_00 worth was told next_day delivery , it took 0 days not happy
2	the range could do with expanding on performance parts
2	great service today from emily at online_chat , who handled my issue in a pleasant and professional_manner
2	super_fast shipment as always
2	perfect for a dslr and extras with room for a laptop
2	delivered on time and exactly as ordered
2	i got this as a gift for a friend , and he was absolutely_delighted .
2	the package comes with full certification and stickers for him to prove his ' lordship ' and as well as being a fun gift , the mony does actually help a very good cause
2	site is very well_laid_out , items are priced competitively , and virtually always arrive next_day .
2	i came to hifi_gear in hereford in search of a company who were prepared to demo loudspeakers in a relaxed , professional unhurried way .
2	after experiences of john_lewis ( nice stores but difficult to try anything out and very limited for real hifi separates ) and richer_sounds ( the less said the better ), i was very pleasantly_surprised to find that the old_fashioned approach of courtesy , helpfulness and expert friendly advice could still be found in the high tech age !
2	trying out loudspeakers was more enjoyable than i could have hoped .
2	above all , the advice and service provided by jamie and his_colleagues was the key to my wife and i being_able to choose the speakers best suited to our listening style .
2	i can not recommend hifi_gear more highly and would urge_anyone who needs advice coupled_with an excellent range of av products to contact jamire before making any decision .
2	next time , hifi_gear will be my first_port of call !
2	i received an excellent car_hire service from holiday_autos , at a keen price , which exceeded my expectations .
2	the web_site is easy to use and when i requested a change to my booking , it was done quickly without_fuss .
2	on arrival in spain we were greeted_by local rep from the marbesol car_rental company .
2	there was a short wait before the local minibus collected and conveyed us to the car_hire site - only 0 minutes away .
2	within fifteen_minutes of arriving at the car_hire yard , we were on our way driving out of the yard in a new seat_leon car .
2	returning the car was the reverse process and even quicker and simpler - no paperwork or queues .
2	my thanks go to everybody in the ' chain ' who made things go so smoothly .
2	this is simply the only way to dispose of an unwanted_mobile_phone .
2	do it all online and it '_s a painless operation , i am yet to hear if my money has_been paid direct to my bank and that is the only complaint i could make .
2	i ordered a cooker which was not in stock however pixmania came through a delivered 0 day later great , but the cooker never made off the van as it was damaged here begins the problem :-
2	0 ) it took the driver 0 hour to arrange return he then told me to contact pixmania .
2	0 contacted pixmania the next_day and was told i would be notified in 00_hours of the appropriate_action and refund i managed to get across that i wanted a replacement not a refund .
2	0 ) 00_hours no email so back on the phone and through the same story and result wait 00_hours .
2	0 ) 00_hours no email so back on the phone and through the same story and result wait 00_hours so i asked for the head_office number but they don_'_t have one as its in france .
2	0 ) 00_hours no email so back on the phone i spoke the the same person and he was good enough not to fob me off with the usual " i so sorry " but had no choice but to repeat pixmanias ' position which was " we can '_t do anything until the goods are returned " remember i never even received the cooker .
2	so at this point i tried the find out how to contact head_office this time i called dixon group who own pixmania they put me on the the know how group which does delivery and installation with 00_mins they contacted pixmania and i had an email from pixmania they will deliver the cooker in 0 day result at last .
2	despite the above
2	the people i spoke to were polite and as helpful as they were aloud to be and although i wasn_'_t abusive my apologies to them for putting up with an irate customer when their hands are tie by an inflexible system .
2	this could have be sorted by a phone_call to the delivery company to confirm the return and i could have had my cooker 0 days quicker .
2	to pixmania ,
2	please train and allow your staff to make_decisions to help your customers and not have to clear everything through head_office .
2	thanks to your slow lumbering system i will be without a cooker for 00 days instead of my planned 0 day as my gas oven an hob were removed and disconnected ready for my new electric_cooker .
2	just as well you have good staff at your call_centre .
2	update :-
2	following pixmanias ' reply to this review i have been in touch with emma and all is well , i would up their rating to 0_stars if i knew how .
2	no need to repeat all that has_gone before , enough to mention
2	incompetent engineers ; lies from the help - centre ; money taken to which they are not entitled .
2	without a doubt the worst company i have ever had to deal with .
2	i give them one star because it is not possible to give less .
2	i ordered a tent which was delivered promptly ( after a slight_glitch with the delivery company ).
2	on receiving the tent i realised that i had made a mistake in the size of tent i had ordered .
2	it was entirely my fault and i did not expect the company to take it back .
2	not only did they offer either a full_refund or a replacement tent , but even spent a long period of time to help me choose an_alternative .
2	when i chose a replacement i was invited to either take the tent straight_away or , if i wished , i could go away and think about it and they would deliver it to me later .
2	i was given an immediate_refund of the difference in price between the two tents .
2	their customer service went far beyond what i could have expected .
2	i wish all firms were as helpful as this .
2	i had text from dpd uk to say they would deliver a parcel between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 and to make_sure i was in to receive it .
2	nothing arrived .
2	i checked the tracking and it says " unable to locate " but they have my phone number and only needed to phone and ask for directions .
2	they managed to deliver a parcel here for my neighbour this morning .
2	i now have no idea whether they are going to try again or whether it '_s gone back to the depot .
2	i tried_phoning their customer_services but couldn_'_t get through to a human_being ( their automaton hung_up on me twice ).
2	not fantastic .
2	update 0th_january
2	today the parcel arrived on time .
2	i have therefore updated my rating .
2	i just wish they had got it right first time and still feel that the ability to contact a human_being in their customer_services_department when none of the pre_- recorded options is relevant would be an improvement .
2	this was the third order i ' d placed and it was the the third order that had arrived on time .
2	the quality of the gear0music electo accustic guitar seems to be high considering the price paid although i haven_'_t had time to really play it , but from the time i '' ve spent it '_s got a good sound .
2	and matches the quality of the electric_guitar i brought a few_months_ago .
2	if i had one complaint about gear0music it would be when asking for advice using email , they didn_'_t get back to me , but appart from this minor_issue i '_ve had no other negative issues
2	delivery time given 00 . 00 to 00 . 00 delivered on time could not ask for more .
2	makes a change to be given a 0 hour_slot instead of having to wait in all day .
2	thats what service should be .
2	david
2	good service as you would expect from a good company
2	excellent excellent excellent and very good value
2	( i am not related to anyone in the company but if they wish to pay me commission for this advert name and adders included he he just joking )
2	couldn_'_t access webmail for several accounts under one domain .
2	although i hadn_'_t changed the password i thought i would reset the passwords from the control_panel but the credentials i was using wouldn_'_t work .
2	using the chat support , ' john ' got me access to the control_panel but the mailboxes were not there .
2	they had been deleted by 000reg hence the error .
2	apparently i had free mailboxes either as an error or part of some legacy account .
2	john said :-
2	" we understand that is not your fault however please_note that this was a system error and the emails used were free of charge instead of paying for them .
2	we have previously written to advise you that your account exceeded its mailbox quota and that unless addressed , some of your email_addresses would be suspended after 00 days and deleted after 00 "
2	this is utter_rubbish and i have had no such communication from you either via the post or email .
2	deleting mailboxes in such a wholesale , carefree manner is unacceptable .
2	i only have a couple of domains with you but also run a web agency and will be moving mine and all future business away from you .
2	thanks .
2	i have been shopping with supplements wharehouse for 0 years_now i have tried other stores but always come_back to sw because you literally can '_t beat their prices or their range of products ive turned all my friends and family on to them
2	see_above : that '_s all there is to say .
2	keen price - swift service - excellent tracking and courier service .
2	i have placed quite a few orders over the last 00 months , standard delivery is 0 - 0 days .
2	great product range and pricing , never had to use customer service so can '_t comment on that but orders are processed efficiently with no delays .
2	they do exactly as they say they will do , better prices than another distributor i deal with and a wider_range .
2	great service , delivered next_day .
2	if any of the " customer service " personnel worked face to face with the public they would be punched in the mouth for sure .
2	i spent £_000 on an all - in - one pc and paid for nominated day delivery .
2	it never arrived .
2	i had to chase them constantly over the next couple of days to be told " it was despatched from our supplier 00_minutes ago " yeah_right !
2	when it did eventually arrive the machine constantly rebooted with a " error 0000 no os ( operating_system )".
2	i again chased for days for a return number which when eventually it arrived , brazenly stated that i would have to pay £_00 to have the pile of garbage returned .
2	unbelievable .
2	i phoned them and was told in no uncertain_terms either pay or leave it where it is .
2	this place gives internet trading a bad name and to think comet went_bust trying to compete against these ill - mannered thieves .
2	at_least comet knew what customer service was .
2	i was in the market for a few pc '_s for my business but their attitude has probably lost them £ 0 , 000 in sales .
2	to the directors of laptops direct - you need to do an " undercover boss " episode .
2	to prospective_customers - do yourself a favour go and soil your underwear , you '_ll have much more fun !!
2	oh and i too think 0_star is too much but it '_s the minimum .
2	have to admit my first purchase from this company was based on price .
2	they had my favourite continental gp0000 tyres at a very good price .
2	however when one tyre unexpectedly split after a couple of months their service was fantastic .
2	i sent back the faulty tyre on the monday after my ride and received a replacement in the post by thursday
2	i could not believe a service of this nature could br opperated so quickly , will_definately be comming_back and recommening to others .
2	chicken casserole - perfect for a winter '_s night after an exhausting day '_s work !
2	needed a pair of b0 boots , ordered one set that were slightly tight ( narrow fit ), returned them and they immidiatley sent another ( different company ) pair of b0 '_s .
2	they did not charge me the postage for this second pair , spent some time on the phone checking the fit compared to the first pair , and they arrived within 00_hours of ordering .
2	boots are outstanding !
2	so is the service , cannot_praise them too highly , they returned calls and were very patient with some of the staff being particularily knowledgable .
2	as a regular used of mail order , i was very happy with outdookit .
2	easy to navigate website , prices competitive , fast delivery service
2	ordered a spare_part for a shower , communication was better_than_expected , despatch and delivery was first_class .
2	will use again for future orders
2	purchased online a pioneer avh - 0000dab audio system , as the local outlet to me , didnt want to supply ( although i bought leads from them ( wrong type )) and a superb alpine dab aerial .
2	nearly all installed now ( overcoming vw canbus system )
2	would recommend buying from them , but not very good technically
2	a brilliant company , a pleasure to do_business with , knowledgeable_staff and super_fast delivery / service
2	i ordered some additional memory and key ring phone chargers using standard delivery .
2	items arrived securely_packaged within two_days of the order being_processed .
2	very good prices and very happy with the service .
2	i ordered a replacement rubber_mat for a turntable , having looked around bopdj were the cheapest for an original part .
2	having placed the order the mat arrived within two_days securely_packaged .
2	minimum_fuss , easy to set_up an account and would definitely recommend !!
2	!
2	sky_poker is one of the best sites on the net .

2	the sky_poker community is fantastic too either just for chatting and fun or the best advice around to help improve your game .

2	everything about this hotel ticks the right boxes spotless . great location . good food / friendly staff .
2	bought the spigen tough armour case for iphone_0s .
2	looks good , feels good , simple to put on .

2	overall very satisfied with the official spigen_case .
2	delivered in 0 days from email excelent .
2	only_downside there was no scart_lead to connect the dvd only socket plug .
2	the website is very well thought out with lots of different search options .
2	i was able to search for parts specific to my motorcycle make and model , so i got exactly the correct parts for my bike .
2	i was able to perchase a full service pack for my motorcycle comprising of good quality oil a ngk spark_plug , oil and air filters for only £_00 !
2	checkout was a breeze via_paypal .

2	i will_definitely be a return customer
2	i '_m always a bit_cautious_about using the internet for shopping and especially a new supplier . but things move on and a lot of business is carried_out this way .
2	led_light_bulbs are very new and certain sizes hard to find . blt_direct are presently the only supplier i have found who supply sbc fit in led . good service , reasonable price i will_certainly use them again , and recommend blt_direct .

2	i have been advised by homeopathy specialists to use supplements as i am no_longer a spring chicken !
2	being a bit_sceptical i went along with the recommendations , but i have to say they work .

2	roger
2	good service , competetive_prices what more could you want ?
2	roger

2	“ hi there !
2	just wanted to say that it took me months to save up for my furniture ( tokyo ), which was delivered today , and i was a bit_nervous_about ordering stuff i hadn_'_t actually seen - particularly as i have seen some really poor quality furniture when looking round .
2	however , i '_m absolutely_delighted with it !
2	the quality is fantastic - and i '_ll be ordering some dining_chairs next month !”
2	always had no trouble and quick deliveries .
2	for the price the product is better_than can be expected .
2	they are almost_half the price of the cheapest rival i can find .
2	i ordered some products for my birds but they have not arrived after 0_weeks .
2	i have been trying to use the live_chat , the telephone_number and sending messages .
2	i have had no reply from any of these systems .
2	i am about to make a complaint to paypal .
2	i wish i had checked this site first , i don_'_t know how this company is staying in business .
2	i can buy items here that i would not buy on other_sites because the addition of delivery charges makes the product too expensive .
2	this site allows me to order things with no delivery charge , this makes them a bargain .
2	i get get the products for the same price i would get them if i had a local shop .
2	i do hope the sort_out the delivery difficulties though , sometimes i have waited a bit too long for a delivery .
2	this is especially important when it comes to bags of feed .
2	been using ebay for years and never had any_problems , highly_recommend this site :)
2	if your looking for it , amazon has got it !!
2	excellent products delivered quickly .
2	first time user but by no means the last :) excellent from the design to the delivery , many thx :)
2	set_up direct_debit with tesco credit_card in april for full monthly payment .
2	got interest added on in may and june statement .
2	got interest credit back immediately , after costly 0000 phone_call to tesco credit_card call_centre .
2	cancel my direct_debit today .
2	never pay tesco credit_card using direct_debit facility .
2	their system is flawed .
2	when applying , there is no clear warning such as ,” you will receive a message on your xxxcard statement when your direct_debit has_been set_up .
2	until then , please continue to pay your account in the usual way .”
2	the direct_debit guarantee stipulates ,
2	if you request tesco bank to collect a payment , confirmation of the amount and date will be given to you at the time of the request .
2	even_though in my may statement : your nominated_bank_account will be debited with the full balance on 00 / 00 /_0000 or soon after .
2	to my horror , in my june statement , i still have £ 0 . 00 interest added on for not paying on time previously .
2	just received my phone bill today , £ 0 . 00 ex - vat to tesco credit_card call_centre .
2	in may £ 0 . 00 ex - vat to tesco credit_card call_centre .
2	one week_ago i notified virgin_mobile that my mobile_phone did not receive any signal in my local area .
2	one week on , the problem has not been solved .
2	however , i have discovered that 0g_network is working fine .
2	cheeky virgin_mobile has quietly reduced my mobile signal in my local area to 0g , while many of their competitors have upgraded to 0g for their networks .
2	yesterday my online_banking was blocked .
2	reluctantly i phoned santander ’_s helpline to unblock it .
2	their helpline number , 0000 , cost me money .
2	to my horror , a credit agency , experian , used by santander has not been informed that i was a santander customer .
2	another excuse came up by santander fraudulent department was that i recently changed my mobile_phone .
2	when i challenged the definition of the word , ' recently ', and they said anything up to 0 months .
2	so , i immediately reminded them that new and better smart phones coming out every few_months .
2	anyhow , i have got a 000 current account , paying £ 0 monthly_fee .
2	so it seems that not only i have to pay a regular monthly_fee for a current account , but also i need to pay extra phone bill .
2	however , i have demanded a refund of £ 0 .
2	the refund of £ 0 would just cover the cost of phoning their helpline department .
2	it covers neither the cost of santander providing a poor service , nor feeling of humiliation , embarrassment and helplessness suffered by me .
2	done my first order online with ocado .
2	their computer is a bit_strange .
2	i bought 0 colgate toothpaste and 00 pronamel toothpaste .
2	ocado computer could not distinguish the two toothpaste when both were doing promotion .
2	the helpline is not helpful .
2	so i have cancelled my order within the hour , and no more online shopping with ocado for me .
2	have used viovet for a few_years_now as my cats need medication on a daily_basis . find their site very user_friendly and their prices a lot cheaper_than my vets .
2	delivery has always been very promp and would highly_reccomend them .
2	an excellent service .
2	after not finding my item locally i turned to the internet .
2	where i found r grahams site , not only did they have the grate i wanted but a lot cheaper then what was quoted by dunsley themselves
2	i duly purchsed and was very pleased with both service and delivery time ..
2	good product but one of them was not stitched at the bottom of the pajama .
2	excellent and prompt service .
2	i placed an order on july 0th 0000 for 0 pairs of work trousers and a pair of knee_pads , everything that has happened to shaun happened the same to me .
2	they answered my call once ( after 0_weeks ) and promised delivery within the next 0 days , i am still_waiting on 0th_september .
2	i would never use this company again .
2	and i have requested a full_refund , i will get my work trousers from krowmark embroidery .
2	i have just left another message on their answer phone asking them to get back to me , i doubt they will but it ’_s worth a try .
2	it looks_like i will have to take this down the legal route
2	very good quality at a competitive price .
2	ordered on the wednesday , delivered the following wednesday , how good was that !
2	“
2	they even phone you the day before your order is delivered and send you a text to confirm its dispatch .

2	in common with the majority of others , you must avoid this company , i have waited 0 months now for an accurate bill that reflects my usage .
2	i had smart_meters installed sadly they were not .
2	i had them taken out and replaced with ' dummy ' meters but am still being sent estimated_bills that relate to the smart_meters removed 0 months_ago .
2	i am now in dispute with the company and while the dispute is ongoing i am building up arrears ( which is worrying )
2	i have asked for compensation and been advised that compensation would not normally be discussed mid - dispute .
2	i have contacted the ombudsman .
2	unbelievably i am reluctant to switch suppliers because for me , given my postcode , first_utility remains on a cost basis , the cheapest .
2	however sometimes cost is not the only factor !
2	!
2	very easy to use website - clear pricing and options .
2	very efficient and friendly in the branch .
2	ordered laptop and i found the whole service excellent .
2	i needed to phone to help me choose some of the options and that was very helpful .
2	delivery was as promised and price was excellent .
2	i would fully recommend .

2	how refreshing to find the transport waiting for us on arrival at kefalonia airport .
2	as we walked past the queues of about 00 people waiting for taxis we felt delighted to have booked in advance .
2	the ride was about an_hour and a half but the views were amazing so we had no_problems .
2	the price on the website was also nearly_half of the other tour companies .
2	will_certainly use again if we need transport .
2	first_class service no problem
2	after the refurbishment of the community centre by the sca , i used the room for a small software training_session .

2	frank galloway of galloway consultancy services ltd is a highly experienced auditor of business systems who helped_me get to grips with the chaotic systems i was working with even_though i wasn_'_t aiming for accreditation at this time .
2	it was very instructive to see him analysing and pointing_out efficiencies .
2	recommended .
2	as part of my kitchen_refurb last_year , i put new cupboard_doors on the old units from hh '_s parent_company jmt trade ltd .
2	i was originally going to reuse the old handles , but after a little_bit of umming and aahing from the other half , i decided to have a look online for the replacements .
2	i hadn_'_t gone into household handles premises because i just assumed they would be dear .
2	not so .
2	when i did find them online , almost accidentally , they were cheaper or similar price as the other_suppliers .
2	because i had already chatted to them about the doors for ages before i made a decision , i knew they were trustworthy .
2	so i had no_hesitation in buying once i had seen their prices .
2	even the part number sticks in my head ... ftd000 traditional pattern knob - i ended_up with 00 of the little tinkers and very happy i was too .
2	they are good people to do a bit of business with .
2	highly_recommended .
2	quick , great choice , lots of additions and very easy to use !
2	!
2	just , simply , excellent .
2	thank_you ........
2	will be using you again .
2	excellent service from online experience through to customer service support and amazingly quick delivery !
2	oh , and the aerobed double camping mattress is pretty blinding too !!!
2	:)
2	delighted with my watchfinder experience .
2	i dealt_with james johnson , nice manner , very professional and helpful .
2	rolex_submariner arrived_safely as_described this morning .
2	i will be using watchfinder again .
2	duncan ( edinburgh )
2	i would not use them again purely_because in this day and age there is no excuse for not processing and sending an order out in just one or two_days following the order instead of 00 days especially as there are so many other_companies to choose from out there .
2	to charge extra for slightly faster processing is not good business practice .
2	also communication only followed when a query was placed .
2	to be fair the product was good and well_packaged and they did respond quickly to queries .
2	however as i say i won_'_t be rushing_back !
2	delivery next_day and service excellent .
2	recommended .
2	super skype - my best tool - never take it away it is a great piece of technology - 0_stars

2	not so , chatted ' on line ' to sarah_h who put it right for me in an instant .
2	very friendly and efficient .
2	thanks for all your help and advice .
2	brilliant news for sports car buffs , brilliant threads and opportunities to find out about whatever you need to and a real sense of community .
2	it '_s a great forum for keeping in contact and getting technical_support , blowing off or having a serious debate .
2	downsides - only one really - a rather incestuous relationship with petrolhead nirvana .
2	there are other tour companies out there , but the amount of free publicity they get on pistonheads must be worth many tens of thousands of pounds !

2	phoned up for simple fridge hinge , no replies for 0 hours , then phoned to to clarify and they were emailing someone_else on totally different email address , very confused as to whether the part for my bosch_fridge was the correct_part despite all info given to them on the product number , so to this end went online to another company part , ordered within minutes and £_00 cheaper , so i would say avoid this company .

2	i ordered online a number of shirts spent_nearly_£_000 however it says online buy one get one free , customer serivces not so unless you add two items to basket , absolutely_ridiculous when clearly the web updates to 0 items for each item , then you receive only one . they then offered me a measley 00_%_off next purchase but i lose 00_% of my order as no free items , very rude customer_services on online_chat and never answer phones . avoid this company be warned shop elsewhere online read all below negative_reviews . digraceful .
2	hi ordered items in one order 0 items despite going into store after receiving email to say to collect on two items arrived , rude staff instore and online help unbelievable poor , like trying to contact india , in short close your online account . dont_bother with debenhams much far_superior customer service on the high_street
2	highly_recommend dealing_with this company , friendly on the phone and any_issues are dealt_with straight_away with no_fuss .

2	i was about to but a washer from ao . com , very attractive price , but here '_s the rub .
2	to get an evening delivery £_00 . 00
2	to get removal of old washer £ 0 . 00
2	to get disconnect of old machine £ 0 . 00
2	to install new machine £_00 . 00
2	this is the extra_cost of £_00 . 00 suddenly not so attractive , some argos offers include all this for free so looks_like my business is going to argos .
2	also argos offer 00 month interest free credit using their argos_card .
2	why don_'_t you do this ao . com
2	we used this firm to send some flowers to our relatives in vienna .
2	the service and quality was really first_class .
2	i took our van to the halfords auto centre at blackpool .
2	manager quoted a price which was the cheapest by far .
2	they did the work and pointed_out some other issues that needed attention in the future .
2	the quote was met and that is the price i paid .
2	i was very satisfied with both the staff and the quality of work and would not_hesitate to recommend the blackpool site to any one .
2	had a thief smash my window this afternoon , i called my insurance who said i must use autoglass .
2	i called them at 0000 today , they suggested they would call to fix tonight between 0000 and 0000 .
2	this is a totally_unreasonable .
2	i told them not to bother !!!
2	! they really dont have a proper out of hours service be warned if you use them they cant really care offering stupid times like that .
2	i have used this service before and had a good service but not this time .
2	i called them 00_mins before i arrived at manchester terminal 0 only to be told we are very busy as this time and you will have to wait 00 - 00_mins outise the terminal .
2	i mean they know we are coming and at wha time .
2	the police were not impressed .
2	they dont like you wating more than a few minutes .
2	when we got back this morning i was told we are very busy and only have one driver and you are 0rd in the queue .
2	i waited 00_mins at 0000 this moring in the cold .
2	when i called them they were verty rude .
2	they also had clocked up over 00 miles on my car so not so impressed this time .
2	i bought some verifocals in may 0000 and had them within a week .
2	they were not comfortable so i tried to get a refund as their policy .
2	however , they don_'_t tell you that they will not refund for lenses which is most of the cost .
2	i ended_up ordering a new pair with a partial_refund for the frames and paying the cost of the lenses again .
2	it took_ages to get these back and they did not have the reactions lenses nor the polarizing lenses i had paid for .
2	i sent them back again and eventually_settled for a partial_refund and to them sent back as they were , as it was now three_months since my first purchase and i was not willing to wait any longer .
2	my partner unexpectedly had to go to london and would be away for her_birthday .
2	having left things till the last_minute i contacted e . florist to have a bouquet delivered .
2	bouquet arrived on the day requested and were beautiful , well received by my partner and i would certainly recommend their service
2	having had a bad_experience with an on = line agent in the past i was a little_apprehensive , but the way in which the first viewing was handled ... via_text just worked_brilliantly .
2	propert rented with one month of advertising ...
2	delighted many_thanks .
2	ok it '_s easy and worthwhile going via their site to do purchases and get the credits , but a bit of a hassle actually trying to get " cash " back .
2	site said the retaillers wouldn_'_t agree to me getting the cash transferred_into my bank_account ( after giving my full bank details !)
2	and pushed me towards " love to shop " vouchers .
2	i have went down this road as it '_s still ok but i would have preferred to actually get " cash " xxx
2	i '_ve been using this site for a few_years and they ' re always reliable .
2	easy to use and helpful website .
2	reasonable prices .
2	good , helpful and effective communication .
2	prompt dispatch .
2	would use again .
2	i booked online to have my exhaust checked and when i turned_up , the man at the garage was very rude and said i didn_'_t have an appointment because i hadn_'_t phoned .
2	nowhere did it say i had to phone when booking .
2	he then checked their computer system to see that the booking was on and he discovered that it was .
2	no apology , just another tirade about no - one had phoned him .
2	i felt_like walking out and going elsewhere !
2	he said to drive the car in and he ' d have a look , which he duly did after 00_minutes or so .
2	the he gave_me a quote which was £_00 more than the quote i ' d been given at my local_garage .
2	i said no thanks .
2	i won_'_t be using them again !
2	good products , good price , fast dispatch .
2	my 00 year_old father has had a pride 0 mph scooter for some years which has_been excellent in operation for him .
2	however now he has stopped driving a car , he asked me to source a small 0 mph scooter suitable for taking onto a bus .
2	in doing some_research i came_across proridermobility . com .
2	their website says all the right things i . e “ as seen on bbc top gear ”,_“ famous reputation by providing the highest_level of customer service and after sales service in the land ”,_“ priority to any sale is the peace of mind which the customer can have ” and “ 0_star back up service and warranty second to none ”.
2	these self ( deluded ) awarded references are , in my opinion , completely false and very misleading as i will now tell .
2	as there are size / specification restrictions for taking a scooter onto public_transport , i telephoned pro_rider and spoke to [_name_] in sales to get advice on a suitable model .
2	i explained what was required and for what purpose and on her advice , i decided on the pro_rider elite portable scooter at £_000 . 00 as she said it was certainly fit for purpose required .
2	the scooter arrived in packaging that needed to be cut open to gain_access .
2	fully charged my father took the scooter 00 yards along the pavement in his cul - de - sac , so he could cross a small side road with drop kerbs .
2	the scooter went down the first drop kerb ok but ground to a complete halt when trying to get up the opposite drop kerb .
2	now this is a perfectly normal low gradient ( 0 : 00 ) drop kerb but this scooter was unable to drive up it !!
2	my father was then stuck on the scooter which was firmly stuck having grounded itself on its two stabiliser wheels !
2	incidentally my father weighs 00 stone so not exactly heavy .
2	i then tried the same manoeuvre taking a faster run up but the same thing happened to me – stuck with no ability to go back or forward !!
2	in order to get it to move again , i had to get off it and drag it back ( which my father on his own would not manage ) onto level ground and drive 00 yards back to his garage and park it up .
2	totally not fit for purpose – utterly_useless !
2	my father agreed with me that the scooter be returned with an explanation as to why it was not fit for purpose and request a full_refund as this was only 0 days after delivery .
2	i rang and spoke to another sales staff_member [_name ], who said the scooter “ should ” be ok for the intended use .
2	i said it was not and said we wanted to reject it and could they arrange to collect it .
2	no was the answer they would not !
2	i asked if the carrier they used to deliver it could be contacted to help and i was told no again .
2	we would have to re - pack it and get it to them ourselves .
2	i therefore packed it myself and arranged for a courier at a cost to us of £_00 . 00 to deliver it back to proridermobility . com
2	a few_days_later proridermobility . com wrote back to say they had received the scooter back in a dirty and damaged condition !
2	i then rang their general_manager , a man called [_name ].
2	he claimed that the damage was sufficient that they would take £_000 off the price paid .
2	i asked for photos as i said that the scooter was clean and had only been ridden for a few yards .
2	the photos he sent were not very good but showed a couple of scuffs marks – not £_000 worth of damage !!!
2	about a week_later my father got a partial_refund of £_000 . 00 .
2	so we ended_up with a lot of aggravation , wasted hours of our time which we paid £_000 for !!!
2	.... and still had no scooter .
2	i feel very let_down by this experience with proridermobility . com so before you buy from them rather_than another supplier be warned !!!
2	on my experience they are a company who are happy to take your money but when things turn out like those we experienced they don_’_t want to know or help and will then find a way to not refund in full .
2	good points : absolutely none at all .
2	negative points :
2	0 .
2	£_000 is low and it shows in the quality of the prorider scooter which is low grade in design & finish .
2	0 .
2	the performance was appalling not able to go up the smallest of gradients .
2	0 .
2	the shopping_basket had such a poor fitting it fell_off at the first small bump in the pavement .
2	0 .
2	proridermobility . com are not a customer service focused company – by any stretch .
2	we both feel extremely let_down by this awful experience with proridermobility .
2	my advice is to read_reviews carefully before_deciding what and who to buy from .
2	perhaps a safer and even better option when buying a mobility_scooter is to go to a local retailer rather_than buying something untried online from a company who could lead to the type of problems we encountered .
2	you should then be able to test_drive and make a satisfactory purchase .
2	this is what we ended_up doing and my father is delighted with the small shoprider monaco scooter bought from the well stocked retailer ‘ the mobility shop ’ in west moors , ferndown , dorset .
2	this scooter performs really well and incidentally has no problem getting up the same drop - kerb the prorider failed at .
2	he has now made his first trip taking it on the bus with ease .
2	i expected my review to end on this more positive_note but i ’_m sorry to say it does not !!
2	having posted my review at the beginning of january_0000 , my father received a telephone_call out of the blue from the general_manager at proridermobility .
2	he claimed that the review was libelous and said they were considering legal_action !!
2	my father told_him that the review could not be libellous as it was the truth .
2	a little while later he rang my father again to say that he had now spoken to his staff and he now had a truthful understanding of the situation .
2	( did that mean the scooter we had returned was not even the dirty , damaged one they had previously referred to ?!)
2	they were now prepared to offer my father £_000 .
2	my father told_him he was happy with that .
2	however they would only do this on the condition that i remove the review i had posted and ceased to post anymore .
2	the gm wanted to speak to me which we did the next_day .
2	he agreed with me that my review was not made in haste and was thought through well but reiterated the conditional offer .
2	i explained why i felt that they should be to cover the consequential loss of expenses and compensate me for the day off i had to take and the 000 mile_round_trip to sort this out .
2	i said an additional £_000 was more than fair .
2	as it was not his decision he said he would get back to me .
2	but he never did !
2	some days_later my father received two emails a few_days apart_from mr simon_betts managing_director of proridermobility full of incorrect statements but saying that as communication had broken down they were taking_legal_proceedings and considering contacting the police regarding my review !!!!
2	i decided enough was enough and wrote to the md mr simon_betts of proridermobility as this was a complete nonsense and i did not take kindly to the bullying_tactics of this md simon_betts .
2	i spent a considerable time and effort to spell out all the inaccuracies in his ridiculous email .
2	in return i got a email back from mr simon_betts spouting more rubbish but the threats had now got serious .
2	mr simon_betts was now accusing me of blackmail and threatening to sue for “ substantial damages ” as i had not removed my review !!!
2	some 0_weeks_later i have not heard a thing from their solicitors or the police or mr simon_betts .
2	to say all of this fiasco and accusations has vexed me would be an_understatement .
2	i have no_intention of being bullied into removing my review as it is 000_% accurate and the deplorable way my father and i have been treated is exactly why the review will remain live .
2	do not buy from proridermobility . com they are awful and their product is too .
2	a reliable online vet meds supplier that i have used before and will use again .
2	excellent !
2	very pleased with my purchases here .
2	keep it up !
2	i '_ve bought their ts000 - p wireless lapel and headband microphone kit .
2	only tried it a few_times with a small band i '_ve joined , playing whistles and singing .

2	we ordered a comfort pocket 0000 memory mattress and are delighted with our choice .
2	its is medium - firm and very comfortable .
2	the price was very competitive and included delivery and removal of packing_material .
2	we were further impressed by the offer of a £_00 discount to remove our old mattress .
2	we chose our delivery day - a saturday at no extra_cost .
2	the day before , we received a ' phone_call confirming a 0 - hour delivery slot .
2	then the delivery crew rang on the day further to confirm a 0 - hour_slot .
2	the two man crew arrived as promised and were clean , courteous and professional .
2	what more could we want ?
2	i switched my electricity_supply from scottish_power to isupply energy on 00 november .

2	meter_readings finally accepted on 00 november , but account is still open and no refund cheque issued .
2	looks_like a deliberate series of delays to me .
2	i find that chemist_direct consistently offers good value on large pack royal_canin dog_foods .
2	if i add a few small items to my basket , its easy to exceed the £_00 ceiling for free delivery .

2	i '_m really impressed with the unit since it '_s been running we have had no condensation upstairs where we had a significant condensation problem .
2	i fully reccomend dry - it - out and the rubydry dehumidifier .
2	goods ordered were delivered by the next available post , securely_packaged .
2	i was pleasantly_surprised by this service .
2	it '_s a pity some other_companies aren_'_t this good .
2	i definately_recomend them and will be buying from them again .
2	i had read_reviews and comments regarding the onboard prices and they were not wrong .
2	i cannot understand_why this company charge so much .
2	most people expect a bit of a surcharge when they are part of a captive_audience but when faced with pricing like this , if they are anything like me they become stubborn and refuse to buy virtually anything .
2	if i '_m not mistaken a pint of beer was in the region of 0 - 0 euro .
2	breakfast at 00 . 00 .
2	we survived on a few snacks and probably had 0 - 0 good nights at our destination on what we saved .
2	we returned home on irish_ferries .
2	just as nice for roughly the same travel cost but food and beverage at half the price , 0 . 00euro for a pint of beer .
2	back to dfds .
2	cabins good .
2	staff good to very good .
2	due to exorbitant price of food & beverage i treated this as method of getting from a - b instead of enjoying a relaxing cruise with a nice meal and glass of wine .
2	if dfds charged reasonable prices on board their customers would spend twice as much .
2	ordered the bed around lunchtime monday requesting delivery to n . irelandand it was delivered to my door , free of charge , by a very helpfuldelivery man at 0pm the next_day .
2	unbelievable .
2	it was about half theprice of a leading discount furniture store for what to me looks_like theexact same product .
2	the manufacturers have obviously added a fewadditional parts to improve the bed and have not updated the instructionsbut it was fairly easy to work out .
2	highly_recommended from a thoroughlysatisfied customer .
2	well donemervyn kinney .
2	each item i have ordered has arrived within 00_hours .
2	i have added londonmagicstore to my list of favourite sellers , and would recommend them to anyone .
2	excellent & fast service they unlocked my iphone0 and it works very well .
2	thank_you
2	i ordered two_pairs of reading_glasses .
2	everything fine .
2	after about two months one of the nose_pads on one pair fell_off and was lost .
2	annoying , but these things_happen .
2	it won_'_t be a problem as long as specky can solve it .
2	i contacted specky to ask if they could send me a nose_pad and screw .
2	i received a very nice reply saying that wasn_'_t possible so they would re - send my complete order .
2	a week_later , two_pairs of glasses arrived .
2	one might be wary that customer service won_'_t be so good from an internet seller as from a high_street shop .
2	in this case that is clearly not so and i am_delighted with the service from speckyfoureyes .
2	thanks , samantha .
2	fantastic as so good with staff available 00 / 0 who do a wonderfull job .. first_class in every_respect .
2	good prices comfortable surrounds and quality accomadation .
2	highly_recommend ;]
2	i purchased some electronic_cigarettes how ever money taken in july and to this date nothing in post and the company who was posting told me when i asked why delay apparently waiting for goods from china weeks go by nothing same excuse and then ring again bizarrely now no one answers .
2	i look at their web_page and strangely_enough they are on a fourth_floor in a building in london .
2	contact voucher and they say give them 00hours to respond blah_blah .
2	well i would not buy from them if they gave a holiday for £_00 .
2	all i want is a refund .
2	basically dont be conned like me .
2	you can not go_wrong as this is one great place to be in , as every time you read an email or open up the shop to buy or go to a campaign you gain points and when you become a v i p member you make more points its quite amazing , and the more activities you do well its endless , you just make more to buy more !!!
2	its truly a place no one in their right minds should miss , you cant lose but plenty to win and tell your friends as i am sure you will ...
2	go on give it a go .
2	this company is absolutely_useless run by a load of cowboys why people don_'_t use royal_mail more often is beyond me and out of all the alternatives this lot of morons are the worst even worse than yodel would you believe and they are rude with it , if i could give them half a star i would , had i known my amazon order was coming through them i ' d have paid extra for royal_mail , but at_least i know next time , ovoid this company at all costs .
2	the dehumidifier is much_better_than i expected .
2	it is slim enough to stand against the wall without causing an obstruction and quiet enough to use in the bedroom at night .
2	delivery was very quick .
2	if i need another dehumidifier i know where to go .
2	i ordered the saw at 00 . 00 on thursday and it arrived at 0 . 00 on friday with free delivery and it was 00_%_cheaper_than screwfix .
2	unbelievable !
2	i always get my coenzyme q00 from just vitamins as they are the cheapest and they always arrive within a couple of days .
2	cant_fault paddocks but i would like to see less britpart products .
2	great product , great price . great service . fantastic .
2	fantastic price and fantastic service . well_done !
2	fantastic service . fantastic price . will use again . its a shame all companies are not run like this one . well_done .
2	phoned for some information on a couple of items i was about to order and received friendly and helpful advice .
2	the guy offered to take to order over the phone but as i ' d completed most of it online i continued with the website .
2	email acknowledgements and delivery details all arrived promptly and i was able to track the package .
2	the whole order arrived incredibly quickly and everything works a treat .
2	a very happy customer !
2	if you want to use a professional company that cares_about your delivery and your parcels you must use yodel , very professional and very helpful .
2	would use this company as often as possible , great service .
2	many_thanks again for your service .
2	paul
2	product arrived as order .
2	delivery was quick and product packed very well .
2	many_thanks .
2	paul
2	phoned up to confrim that my parcel was out for delivery the next_day after ordering i was told it was tracked as " out for delivery " so i stayed in .
2	late_afternoon as it had not arrived i phoned again and asked for the tracking_number which they gave_me , but when i tracked the parcel it showed it had not even left the hub in london .
2	i waisted the best part of the day waiting in as i was given the wrong information about the progress of the parcel .
2	i phoned again and asked why i had been told it was out for delivery when it was clearly not and i found i was dealing_with one of the most useless rudest company '_s i had ever delt_with .
2	the guy on the end of the phone kept telling_me no one would have said that to me if it was not the case and refused to let_me speak to a some one higher up in the company .
2	he kept telling_me that i had made my mind up any way and what was the point of talking to any body else .
2	i am presuming he was the one that told me it was out for delivery in the first place .
2	he also kept blaming parcelforce , but my problem was not with parcelforce being late just the fact i was waiting for something that was never going to arrive when i was told to expect it before 0pm .
2	very good and fast service
2	my wife had to renew her passport recently and it arrived ( eventually ) via this excuse for a company .
2	the driver failed to deliver on day one , unable to operate the doorbell .
2	so , we visited the website which was unresponsive .
2	tried again 0 hours_later and eventually re - booked delivery ( they try hard at this point to charge you for accelerating the service ).
2	passport was delivered the next_day after the driver phoned , again unable to operate the doorbell
2	well , today we have ( not ) received yet another home office document .
2	so , back to the website - it tells_me the ticket number and postcode i have entered don_'_t match ( hello ...
2	i have your card dx group , you were here at this postcode at some point this morning ).
2	after much messing_around on the phone (" why not pay to accelerate your delivery ...") re - booked for tomorrow .
2	what is the government thinking_about !
2	passports , id cards and such like are important_documents , you need them to get on planes and so on .
2	using this company illustrates just why public services often maintain such a poor public image .
2	one also wonders , given the nature of what they are delivering whether there is actually intent to get you to pay for delivery ?
2	got a plane to catch ?
2	great stuff !
2	this is the first time i have had dealings with wheelspin_models and they were first_class all the way !
2	i shall definately work with them in the future and do not_hesitate to recommend their services .
2	thanks .
2	i have used wheelspin_models many_times since taking up r / c car racing two years_ago after a break of 00 years .
2	their service has always been very prompt and accurate .
2	items i have needed have been sent immediately and received in good time and safe packaging .
2	ordering through the website is easy and updates on progress of each order are recieved regularly .
2	a great company to buy from , i recommend them to all r / c enthusiasts .

2	secretary , bristol model car club
2	general secretary , southwest association of model boat clubs
2	what more can i say - everything as promised .
2	politicians please take_note , review rating here 0_stars excellent .
2	well earned .
2	promised and delivered .
2	unlike another profession , 0_star , i could mention - oops sorry , already_mentioned them .
2	had a problem sending from one of my email accounts - it was fixed in the blink of an eye .
2	excellent support !
2	phil at gr0
2	really fast service and a great service when sending back a exchange item , paying return postage is part and parcel if you order a incorrect item .
2	could have got slightly more for my 0 phones at other_sites but their feedback / reviews were very negative so i used mazuma .
2	sent the phones on monday , money was in my bank tuesday .
2	furthermore the amount agreed was in my account , not less like other purchasing sites seem to do .
2	if you are thinking of using them .... do it i '_m glad i did .
2	bought a very competetively_priced rab downie for my wife '_s xmas_present .
2	quick and helpful on the phone checking stock prior to order , quick delivery and very helpful after xmas when having to swap as the size was wrong ( my fault not theirs ) they were sensible and relaxed about the deadline for exchanges .
2	excellent company to deal with , would strongly_recommend them .
2	it just shows you can give a good serivce if you think thats important .
2	poor service , difficult to communicate with , if it was the customers choice i ' d never use this company .
2	for customer service , ease of use etc our experience is that the post_office is best organisation to receive parcels from - the flexibility in picking_up your parcel you get if you are out at work is great with po ,
2	dhl not too bad and you can get to speak to a local human_being easily without going on line but yodel - rubbish - they even have to ask the local posties where the delivery addresses are .
2	i '_ve now bought a camera and a couple of extra lenses from park_cameras , and have experienced prompt attention and delivery on each_occasion
2	they managed to provide an item i had had great difficulty in locating at other on - line retailers , and at a lower price .
2	took just four days from order to delivery .
2	these are indeed great pieces of kit , had one in the previous house , albeit a genuine early victorian one i had reclaimed and restored , i generously left it for the new owner , the thing i find interesting is that this type of airer seems to have more relevance in modern houses that have less usable space for drying clothes during inclement_weather , i guess people often just throw money into tumble driers , pulleymaid airers are not only a green alternative but i would guess , as a replacement for a tumble_drier , will repay their initial cost many_times over .
2	excellent service with very quick delivery
2	copy of e_- mail sent to hursts .
2	in response to an order placed on a sunday_afternoon
2	" as always superb service and great price , despite some of the worst snow this year , combined with us living in the most remote village in england , you still managed to get the mixer to me in under 00_hours , as always your couriers were on time polite and courteous ."
2	i then had a small query after delivery :-
2	sent e_- mail query at @ 00 - 00hrs , received a response with resolution at 00 - 00_hrs
2	i doubt any company could equal let_alone better the service i received from hurst and sons
2	the goods arrived on time and were in excellent condition and loved by the person i gave them to
2	as a local theatre group we have a regular need for printed matter in the form of flyers , posters and programmes for each of our productions .
2	over the years we have tried various printers , many of whom were based some distance away , and contact was by phone or email .
2	with printing . com we have been delighted to find a locally based printing company which is very approachable and affordable , and which offers a design and print service to an extremely high_standard , which we feel reflects the quality of our shows .
2	our recent pantomime programme for aladdin won the scottish national and operatic and dramatic ( noda ) award for best programme .
2	the warm , relaxed_atmosphere and friendly staff in my local printing . com at glasgow south ( special_mention to peter and heather ) makes any visit there a real_pleasure .
2	no matter_how large or small the job is , it is delivered on time and to the same high_quality finish .
2	having now dealt_with printing . com for the past four years i can thoroughly_recommend them - and keep an eye open for their regular special money - saving offers !
2	robert fyfe , runway theatre company , glasgow .
2	bad customer service and no refund for returned goods , until there were threatened with court_action .
2	they advertise very cheap goods that they do not have , just to get people '_s orders of £_00 or more when they offer free delivery .
2	i do not recommend them .
2	i ordered 0 pairs of trainers .
2	they were not expensive and were quickly dispatched and delivered .
2	emails were sent in advance to inform of the order progress .
2	good customer service .
2	ordered behringer fex000 which they had in stock ( can be difficult to find !)
2	on a thursday_evening , delivered 0am the following_monday by parcel_force ( very reliable in this area ).
2	excellent communication re despatch notice / tracking etc - highly_recommended firm , many_thanks for your service
2	the form was easy to fill in and the questions raised re current medication was sensible .
2	the outcome was first_class .
2	i am very pleased with the result .
2	fast efficient delivery and service .
2	good products .
2	great prices .
2	good communication when you order on the net .
2	a really good buying experience .
2	thank_you .
2	i cancelled my contract due to them not being to match a deal with t - mobile , that ’_s where the problems started !
2	i received a text thanking_me for upgrading , i immediately called them and advised i hadn_'_t , and had cancelled my contract - they put me on to their fraud dept who advised my new phone was down to be delivered to london - advised i live in manchester and had not ordered it - they confirmed they would cancel the order .
2	0 days_later i received an email_confirming it had been delivered - long_story_short and numerous_calls later i was assured they had cancelled the contract , they were aware a new phone had been fraudulently obtained by another person and i would hear nothing further .
2	0 months later i receive a letter from a debt_agency advising i owe £ 0000 - called them explained i had no contract with o0 and explained what had happened with the fraud dept , it was advised they would take this up with o0 .
2	at the same time i wrote to o0 expressing my disappointment and asking for a formal apology , i have written twice since and am still_waiting a response !
2	today i have received a further letter from the debt_agency advising they have been instructed by o0 to continue to pursue the debt - this in simple terms is harassment , as i owe them nothing and don_'_t even have a contract with them anymore .
2	simply the worst company i have ever come_across and would advise everyone to stay well clear .
2	scott , the salesman provided an excellent service .
2	the goods arrived ahead of schedule !
2	just ordered a new torch .
2	good description of the website , including how many lumens , so i knew how bright it would be .
2	very happy and impressed by speedy delivery .
2	easy to book via the phone - fitter_turned_up next_day and was all finished within 00_minutes .
2	would recommned to anyone .
2	i tried a number of different tyre_fitting web sites and tyre_shopper always provided the largest and best value range of tyres .
2	i have used them in the past and will use them again .
2	sammie was from_start to finish more than help and really gets the idea of what a good customer service assistant is all about , and deserves to be more than the customer service assistant and others would learn from them .
2	i love cartridge_shop , great value for money , fast delivery and no_quibble over a faulty cartridge at all , they will replace it and you return the faulted one at their expense .
2	i have ordered several_times now from this company and they are are excellent .
2	their goods are of a very high_standard , i bought bamboo needles at an amazing price and the quality of them is better_than any i have ever had .
2	they are always a customer friendly team with a very efficient and very fast delivery .. my orders come in around nine days , all the way to the uk , which is amazing .
2	they can also sort_out any query super_fast and are so helpful , it is a pleasure to do_business with them .
2	i would highly_recommend this company to anyone .
2	i am marjorie in the uk
2	highly_recommended , use them once and you would use them again and again !
2	the replacement av_board promptly arrived and properly packed as usual . i have now installed the replacement av_board and the tv is now functioning_perfectly .
2	it does go to show that persistence and sound_advice / help from flattv parts can have positive_outcome .
2	many_thanks and will indeed come_back again if and when i should have tv troubles
2	excellent , great way of earning some cash foe your old_mobile and all done very easily and quickly +++++
2	excellent price and service
2	bestcameras have an excellent web_site easy to use , purchased the jvc picsio
2	hddgcfm0 camcorder , they certainly had the best package deal i could_find on the web and delivery was lightning_fast ( next_morning ) would use again .
2	have yet to try out the tiny little camcorder so can '_t comment just yet .
2	does look a little plasticy strait from box but my decision was based on sample video_footage on u - tube
2	the waterproofs seem quite good , trousers are a bit coco - the - clown !
2	delivery was terrible !
2	carrier assumed he was at the right house , actually he was trying to deliver to an unoccupied house and kept leaving cards there .
2	eventually twigged when i checked the parcel - track on - line .
2	i pulled_out of the transaction too early , thanks to andrea , recovered all my details and order processed correctly .
2	i use p0g regularly , and will_continue to do so .
2	very happy with all_aspects of my booking with hotel direct
2	very happy with this transaction , customer service contacted me to say there would be a slight_delay in delivery of my order .
2	that was no problem , the important_thing was they kept me informed .
2	i will use firstaid0sport again .
2	excellent online shopping
2	excellent sellers , excellent watch .

2	goods arrived when promised and were well_packed .
2	cleaner is like new again .
2	needed a strong paint stripper to clean up some metal garden_furniture and this stuff really does the business .
2	probably better_than the original nitromors product .
2	quick delivery and well_packaged .
2	i was looking for a device to add some additional security / peace of mind to our_conservatory doors and came_across this product .
2	ironmonger direct offering was exactly_what i was looking for with competitive_pricing and delivery options as well as an easy to navigate site .
2	the on - line tracking capability was an additional bonus knowing that the goods would arrive on the day they were expected .
2	all in all a rewarding_experience .
2	even_though i made them an offer well below the listed price they responded quickly with a fair counter price which still included their free p_&_p which i thought was very fair .
2	the items were better_than i had expected and the delivery was very speedy .
2	all in all a pleasure to do_business with .

2	i ordered over £_000 worth of new cooking_utensils from procook for our new_induction_hob but unfortunately one on the items was slightly_damaged in transit .
2	i contacted vicki in their customers services who politely asked if i was able to email a photo of the damage which i did .
2	within less_than an_hour i received a email back to advise me that a replacement would be sent out that day and in fact it was sent next_day delivery as well .
2	there are a number of companies i have dealt_with in the past who would have been put to shame by such welcome and responsive customer_services offered by procook .
2	brilliant
2	000 had the best on - line price and delivery option for this washing_machine and with their " guaranteed " 0hr delivery slot was the best i could_find .
2	the delivery was made within the agreed slot and all associated packing etc .
2	was removed along with the old machine exactly as it said " on the tin "
2	excellent service and excellent pricing .

2	i had been waiting for a month and a half for my local music store to order in a cable !
2	absolutely_hopeless .
2	ordered a patch cable from gear0music yesterday_afternoon and received it first thing this morming .
2	good communication_throughout via_email and sms .
2	it was only a cable !
2	gear0music 00 out of 00 - local_store - forget it they are useless .
2	used soho 00 for a few_years always have been professional and had no issues at all .
2	all i had to do was unscrew the existing door_hinges , screw them into the new doors and hey_presto !
2	the replacement drawers were a little more fiddly though but i got them assembled and fitted eventually .
2	the end_result was well_worth the time and effort .
2	good quality kit does what is says on the tin and and a far better price than many other_companies
2	many_thanks will be in touch when the next kitchen job comes up
2	matt , surrey

2	i have used your services several_times when organising transfers for groups of 0 and 00 resepectively and we have been met by courteous and friendly drivers at the airport arrivals as we exit the customs so no_hassle or stress searching for our transport while keeping the group together .
2	the driver on one of the trips was so friendly that one of the girls wanted her picture taken with him !
2	the transports have been very prompt waiting for us each time and brand_new vehicles with leather interiors that started and finished the special trips in style .
2	good value too .
2	we will use you again , many_thanks .
2	ordered a copy of family tree maker 0000 , but web_site appeared to show picture of 0000 box .
2	phoned to confirm the actual version they were offering but they were either unwilling or unable to check for me - had a look on his system and told me he could only see much earlier versions available .
2	however they assured me that i would receive the 0000 item as_described if that was what they were offering on their site , and if it was not so i could return it for a refund .
2	placed the order on thursday and received the 0000 version on saturday .
2	their price was far cheaper_than anywhere_else on the web .
2	great delivery and price - pity about the call_centre .
2	i had been looking for a rolex_submariner non date for a while and was recommended watch_finder by a friend .
2	i joined their mailing_list and received a mail that listed all their current rolex stock .
2	i found the watch i wanted and called them .
2	i spoke to tom hunt and from_start to finish the process was efficient and tom was professional and explained to me how to use the website .
2	i purchased the watch and arranged to pick it up the following week
2	i collected yesterday and was amazed at the condition of the 00 year_old watch .
2	it is truly as new .
2	thanks tom

2	after spending several unsuccessful hours visiting local_plumbers_merchants in search of an unusual size box spanner , i decided to look online and discovered tw_wholesale .
2	i rang at 0 . 00pm and was told the item would have to be ordered in but that they would be able to receive it and despatch it to me the next_day .
2	i thought this unlikely because of the late hour but decided to order anyway ... the guy i spoke to was friendly & helpful .
2	i was very pleasantly_surprised to receive a despatch confirmation_email the following_day and true to word , the out - of - stock item was delivered within_00hrs .
2	truly impressed - thank_you tw_wholesale !

2	i bought online from ffx in jan_0000 ; it was my first purchase and was based on price and their well - maintained and informative website .
2	low_prices usually mean that service suffers in some way but not so with ffx .
2	my item arrived very quickly and i was kept_informed with email_updates along the way .
2	my second purchase of smaller items was treated with the same care and level of service .
2	i will_certainly buy from ffx again and would recommend this company with no_hesitation .

2	we were mis_- sold brightpearl on the basis that it was a product you could implement yourself without little trouble , the main_advantage with paying would be the speed in which it would be done but we could not justify_paying £_000 / per day for five days works , even_though this was given at a 00_%_discount .
2	after trying to implement we came_across numerous issues and raised tickets which went_unanswered and were later told that ticket system was not there for implementation issues and we should have opted for paid implementation .
2	after weeks of getting_nowhere and passed from one person to another , i landed up with , james scott – senior vice president , customer service , believe me , a grand title really did not account for anything .
2	james went on to explain that unless we had erp experience we should never have been told that we would be able to self implement , and he was adament that we would not have been told we could implement ourselves without this by his sales_team .
2	when i told_him we were never told this and infact his own online literature makes no reference to erp and claims self implementation is an option and only warns that it will take you longer .
2	he said that we must have spoken to a new member of the sales_team ( spoke to the same person for a 0 - 00 month period ) and that the literature should be updated ( which is still as it was two months_ago , today !! )
2	we then went through a early_termination review , lol !!
2	what a total load of b *** ocks !!
2	a process made up by brightpearl which is a total_joke , and i questioned james authority and position within the company if this review had to take place at all .
2	anyway , they stood by their decision , not to refund me the quarterly bill we had already paid as they had upheld their part of the t &_c and are still adament that we were not lied to by the sales_team and everyone after that , even james had lied to me within the communications we have had .
2	we actually rang the sales_team after all of this and came_across very dumb , asking very basic questions , giving the impression we could just about navigate our way round a keyboard , yet where still told that brightpearl was suitable for self implementation !
2	!
2	beware if you are considering using brightpearl , self implementation is very hard and should not be given as an option , or atleast you should be made aware that erp experience is required !!
2	otherwise you will sign up then be quoted £_000 per day , approx 0 days to carry out the work ( notice it has now dramatically gone up ) when you are unable to carry out the implementation yourself .
2	absolutely_disgusting service , use at your_peril , avoid like the plague !!!
2	!
2	this company is a joke and everything bad in an internet business , ignorant , rude and offer zero customer service !!!
2	the only thing they do well is take your money !!
2	!
2	we ordered a kit for a charity football_match that was due in 0_weeks from date of order and sent all the relevant_information and order was confirmed , was told order was on a 00 day service but as we had ordered so_far ahead it was not an issue .
2	0_weeks in and no delivery so we contacted them , not easy , e_mails unusually ignored and the telephone rings out constantly , but if your have a few hours to kill it gets answered .
2	we were told they were waiting on the medium_size tops and this was due anytime and would get the order out in the next few_days .
2	0_weeks still not received the kit , rang up and eventually got an answer and was fed some story and that the kits were going out any day .
2	0 days before our game and 0_weeks from order , a box arrives
2	0 .
2	no keepers top
2	0 .
2	shorts wrong_colour as ordered
2	0 .
2	sponsors print quality was shocking !!!!!!
2	!
2	rang again and was told that if i wanted to have the correct shorts i would need to return the wrong ones , once received , they would send the correct colour out straight_away .
2	to ensure we had shorts i asked would they send the correct colour first , so if they did not arrive by the saturday ( bear in mind the time we had already waited ) we would have shorts to wear .
2	was told that was not possible , and they would only send the correct ones if they receive the wrong ones , asked what would happen if they did not arrive in time , i was told i could buy replacements locally to me !!!!
2	absolutely_shocking attitude !!!!
2	asked later in the conversation , if i send the shorts next_day delivery , arrive with them on wednesday , would they confirm the correct shorts will be sent wednesday using next_day .
2	this they could not do as they needed to order the shorts and delivery would be 00 days , so if i had sent them we would have been playing without the shorts we ordered !!!!!!!
2	absolutely_disgusting !!
2	!
2	the keepers jersey turned_up on the friday , just in time , but the print quality was as poor as on the tops we had received !!
2	!
2	i had complained on the telephone and followed this up with an e_mail , that has_been received , asking for some money to be refunded to compensate for the wrong shorts ( obviously could not return as we had to wear them ) and for the very very poor print quality , to this day , no one has had the decency to reply .
2	i run an online retail company and if i offered this level of service we would quickly have no customers .
2	we would never use this company again , will never recommend them and will tell anyone that asks the truth !!!!!
2	!
2	as in the uk we always tell everyone about the bad_experiences , this one will be told for a very long time !!!!
2	!
2	in summary - spend your money somewhere_else , this company will tell you initially they can supply on time , but once they have your money you will be ignored , lied to and then ignored again !!
2	!
2	prosocceruk offers the most appauling service ( if you can call it that ) you will ever receive from an online_retailer !!!!!
2	as i said in the title
2	use at your_peril , avoid like the plague !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2	!
2	( more than happy to cc prosocceruk in on this , might get a reply from my e_mail )
2	purchased a rolex_submariner ceramic no date from iconic_watches and despite_being sceptical initially , chris put all concerns to rest and was excellent throughout , no question was too much and was always there with quick replies to reassure us that they were working to get the watch to me as soon as possible .
2	when the watch arrived it was spot on , all complete and i was over the moon .
2	iconic_watches will get all my watch enquiries in the future and i suspect the rolex will be the first of many purchases from them .
2	great work chris and the team , thanks !!
2	!
2	bestilling_og_levering virker bare helt som_det skal gøre .
2	very satisfied
2	thank_you for your help emma .
2	excellent service , good prices , prompt delivery .
2	could not ask for more .
2	good prices and prompt delivery .
2	i was kept_informed by the couriers and they arrived when they said they would .
2	i will use this company again .
2	petmeds is the only place i have found to order the precious ovarid for our 00 years plus buetiful lovely black cat .
2	though i have to email the prescription ( obtained from our vet ) to petmeds everything goes_smoothly .
2	the email me to tell me what stage they are up to with the order and it is easy to pay .
2	thanks petmeds for making a complicated procedure simple .
2	regards_dave jones
2	i always search ebuyer . com every time i am searching for an it product .
2	i feel that the range of products are excellent and the reviews are honest and factual .
2	it helps me decide which is the correct product for me .
2	on the day of receipt , i wrote to advise you that i had ordered the wrong item .
2	you have ' nt even bothered to reply .
2	email repeated below
2	dear_sirs ,
2	many_thanks for your extremely qick despatch .
2	i received the order today .
2	unfortunately , it would appear that i have ordered the completely wrong
2	item .
2	is there any way we can exchange for the correct item .
2	please advise .
2	thanks in advance
2	henry
2	order came straight_away and iam getting_married in apri 00th 0000 and waist_coat fantastic my wife to be was so pleased with qulity and colours thanks alan
2	i had to write to them asking about their online job application forms !
2	all i really wanted to know was how to fill the form in as i have window office and it wouldn_'_t fill it in .
2	no answer but application sent in post !.
2	not a lot of help for people that dont understand computers !
2	bought everything i needed from this shop .
2	the only problem i could fault is the cables . they are cheap rubbish that is no good what so ever .
2	and the lights i got as soon as i touched them the button broke .
2	the cables and lights were cheap toys !
2	it does not reflect on the block party pa i bought , that was excellent .
2	be careful and look at what is described ...
2	i have used cult_pens several_times now .
2	in every instance the order has arrived promptly without_any errors .
2	i have found the website easy to use and i will be using the service again .
2	well priced goods , well_packaged and with wings on the parcel .
2	well informed on progress od delivery .
2	no time to try the tracking_system !
2	excellent price and very quick delivery
2	a very efficient service and the best value on the internet .
2	scanned and emailed the prescription on monday_morning and it was despatched later that same day and i received the following_day .
2	splendid value and a speedy and efficient service .
2	ordered 0 tyres online on monday_afternoon ... offered fitting time on thursday - choose am or pm .
2	chose pm .
2	on tuesday_afternoon the fitting_centre called me to say my tyres were now in stock .. come as soon as you like .
2	turned_up wednesday at 0 : 00 .. left the car with them and came back an_hour later to find it all done .
2	good service , fast resolution time , no_problems_whatsoever .
2	will use this again .
2	admittedly bought at a discount via amazon , so immensely good value , but would still consider another at full price .
2	quality hard back cover , and good quality paper .
2	photographs reproduced with true_colours and crisp definition ( except where i chose to keep in photos that the website indicated were not optimal .
2	my choice ).
2	don_'_t underestimate the time it takes to sort the photos into the right order .
2	cropping , fixing red eye , colour tinting .... you can spend hours getting it right , but the project can be saved and returned to .
2	it took some time to get used to the app ! ovation , but i got quicker over time .
2	there are a lot of options to choose from , full page , 0 , 0 , or 0 ( or more ) to a page .
2	delivery was quick and safe , and we are very pleased with the album .
2	much more accessible than hidden away on a computer , and it made me delete a whole load of unnecessary old photos .
2	highly_recommended .
2	easy to use website , good price .
2	follow - up emails came quickly and delivery was fast and easy .
2	a good shopping_experience .
2	will_definitely use for future electrical purchases .
2	had this over a year now , and it has performed_perfectly .
2	it looks lovely , the gentle sounds are very welcoming , and the led_light provides a soft glow in the evening .
2	very easy to set_up , and has run like_clockwork .
2	i put it away last winter when it got really cold , but really don_'_t think i needed to .
2	its ageing nicely , and still works like new .
2	easy to order , and followed up immediately with telephone confirmation .
2	delivered on time by friendly helpful drivers .
2	ok , we had to put on the legs ourselves but that was easy .
2	turning the dining_table upright after attaching the legs was tricky due to the weight of the solid_oak , but managed it with three of us .
2	we have waxed it with the supplied polish , and used it with family and friends , all of whom liked the furniture .
2	an all_round good experience , and i would recommend oak_furniture_land to anyone looking for quality furniture at reasonable prices .
2	really good goggles , very clear and much less mist to look through , great shorts a little tight around the knees but that eases off when i '_m in the water , much_better / faster swim with both !
2	some whiskey glasses and some shot glasses !
2	great stuff !!
2	i love them !
2	i also highly_recommend them .
2	great products , i always really enjoy looking through the myprotein site and choosing different supplements !!
2	i recommend this site to anyone looking for exercise supplements !
2	( and great deals !)
2	when time is of the essence a company offering fast delivery when i ordered was key .
2	with excellent customer service and delivery timescales i was not disappointed with online bathrooms and would not_hesitate to do_business with them again .
2	regards
2	property_developer
2	i am 0 foot two and normally standard jackets are too short but this was perfect .
2	nice material with a rather casual feel which is good as i intend to use it as a jumper replacement .
2	a great buy , thoroughly_recommended .
2	noelle vaz is a great physio who solved my neck problem in just one sitting - superbe
2	outstanding service and great value for money .
2	smooth service and nice people .
2	highly_recommended .
2	very fast delivery , on time and excellent service -
2	what i wanted was out of stock but i was kept_fully_informed on progress .
2	when it came in it was dispatched very quickly .
2	would highly_recommend .
2	good customer service is best judged after something_goes_wrong .
2	i bought a huge bag of daffs which were generally fine but had rather more " duff daffs " than i would have expected .
2	a quick call to the company resulted_in the rapid_dispatch of replacements and a genuine apology .
2	well_done and thank_you .
2	more orders on the way !
2	dougie
2	best prices
2	you can '_t find better prices anywhere_else , and if you do they will match it and give you 0 %_discount .
2	i have ordered from them a lot in the past and will keep doing it in the future .
2	[_name_] gave quick and concise_information and my query was solved with the minimum of fuss
2	at first i was sceptical ... like all online promises , involving a money for service transaction , but i did a little research reading_reviews on the facebook_page , and taking on board the professional face of the website i decided to take the plunge !
2	!... i am_glad i did , the no_nonsense approach did exactly_what it said it would ... i placed my order in the evening the next afternoon my iphone was unlocked and sim free .
2	i will be happy to recommend to my friends and colleagues .. thank_you officialiphoneunlock a happy martyn .
2	i cannot_praise pet_supermarket high enough .
2	we purchased 00kg bird sand at a very competitive price .
2	it was delivered quickly .
2	in fact the courier company , dpd , sent emails and text_messages to say the exact time for delivery and because the driver was a minute early we had to wait to sign for the parcel .
2	excellent service would certainly use pet_supermarket again .
2	you deserve all the custom you get .
2	the staff were very helpful when i telephoned .
2	excellent despatch - the goods received the next_day and were a very competitive price .
2	despite growing numbers of people having screen problems ( usually just after the warranty runs out ) amazon refuse to acknowledge there is a problem .
2	all they seem interested in is selling me an overpriced second_hand kindle .
2	on one hand they insist that kindles cannot be repaired and on the other insist that the tat they are trying to sell me is ' refurbished ' how does that work then
2	out of 0 deliveries i have had problems with 0 .
2	one was delivered to the wrong_address and the current one should have been delivered by latest today and is ( depending who i talk to ) either still in the hdnl hub in droitwich or lost and i need to claim .
2	rest_assured i won_'_t be using them again
2	now this site won_'_t let_me rate at zero_stars
2	i phoned oliver to seek some advice following a recent chargeback transaction .
2	i was given a full explanation of the fraud scoring system and ideas how to prevent repeat occurrences .
2	time was not an issue for oliver , and i have left the conversation feeling positive , and i really appreciated his professional way in dealing_with my requests .
2	a big_thankyou
2	very pleased with buyabattery .
2	they had all the batteries i needed to repair two of mine and three of my daughters watches .
2	very good pricing and for just over twice the ' high_street ' cost of replacing two watch batteries , i have replaced 0 and still have another 00 batteries left .
2	i call that a result , very pleased :)
2	tyre_shopper had the tyre i was looking for at the right price and offered fitting at a time and location that suited me .
2	national_tyres did a great job , once they found the tyre ( it was their display tyre !)
2	they even balanced up another wheel with a new same make tyre that i had recently aquired .
2	hence my need for the particular tyre .
2	all_round satisfactory good job :)
2	seller very helpful when questioned relating to product .
2	graphics_card turned_up in good time , fitted ok and works a treat .
2	really impressed with ease of use of the shopping_cart .
2	there is no vat chargeable in guernsey and this was removed automatically once my postal_address was entered .
2	delivery came special delivery and the purchase was with me within 0 days .
2	most impressive of all was that the garmin camera i got from handtec .
2	came at a far lower price compared to other_retailers offering the same package
2	just returned from really deep powder in austria .
2	thanks to the facewest guys my last_minute order for a new backcountry day pack , shovel and probe all arrived in time to be taken out with me !
2	( even_though one item was out of stock when the order was made ) thankfully no avalanches but was reassured to have the kit with me .
2	this is a great product fast and speedy service , just what i was looking for keep_up the good work thank_you
2	good products and excellent service thanks
2	just what i was looking for , did the job perfectly thankyou
2	the service and products from you are first_class and the service was excellent thankyou
2	i started with 0 trial_frames , which arrived within a couple of days .
2	i found this service very useful and convenient .
2	the two_pairs of glasses i subsequently ordered arrived within about a week .
2	the main problem i think is that they use hermes as a courier .
2	i ordered on 00th_december .
2	since then i have phoned debenhams several_times .
2	they are pleasant enough on the phone , but cannot help as apparently it is impossible for them to talk to hermes and hermes will not respond to customers !
2	during the process debenhams reorganised a separate delivery .
2	neither have arrived as of 00th_december .
2	however hermes tracking tells_me that on several_occasions they have failed to deliver because of access problems .
2	this is total nonsense , as i work at a national logistics warehouse !
2	we have hundreds of deliveries every day .
2	if they can '_t deliver here , they can '_t deliver anywhere .
2	apparently both are now being returned to debenhams as damaged .
2	no doubt they take out their frustration at their gross incompetence on the parcels in their care ?
2	i have also lodged a complaint on debenhams website , but they haven_'_t bothered replying .
2	it is a shame i have to give one star .
2	zero or less would be more appropriate .
2	avoid debenhams and anyone_else using hermes .
2	is it a plot to get us to give up shopping online ?
2	i found the shelving_unit i needed without_any trouble and ordering was easy .
2	i would definitely use again .
2	changed banks , which i was doing anyway , and " earned " £_00 which i received today .
2	overall it took 0_weeks , but it '_s free money so the wait is insignificant .
2	so , don_'_t even think about it , it '_s an_absolute no - brainer , sign up today and start_earning .
2	we needed currency at short_notice , and i went to my local post_office to buy it , having first checked their rates online .
2	however , the rate they offered me was very poor and much_lower_than the online quote , so i decided on principle not to buy from them .
2	i returned home , went online , got a quote from travelex for me to collect the currency next_day at the airport .
2	the rate for euros was almost 00 cents to the pound better_than the post_office , and it took me about 0 minutes to complete my online order .
2	collection at the airport was simple , convenient , and courteous .
2	a perfect result .
2	thank_you travelex , i will be using you again for sure .
2	all dialogue with age_partnership was extremely pleasant .
2	the staff were knowledgeable , personable , and courteous , and put me completely at ease .
2	they helped make a serious business for me relatively easy , and were able to get me a better return for my annuity funds than any other company i contacted , including the " big_names ".
2	i can_honestly recommend them unreservedly .
2	customer reference_number 000000
2	we have booked our usa car_hire with usrentacar on many occasions , but not before carefully checking competitors ' prices .
2	we have never had any_problems at all with using their services , and their prices are always the best .
2	the convenience of printing the voucher at home is very useful too .
2	overall , faultless service and an efficient , user - friendly booking process , means that usrentacar are always a pleasure to deal with .
2	i came_across this company online and spent some time checking them out and comparing it with others .
2	i was very skeptical_about it at first especially after i could not send the money directly using my debit_card and they do not have a paypal_account which i think they should so people can be more at ease and to make it worse , i am located in the islands of cape verde , est africa . but anyway i sent the money transfer through my bank and was eager to get unlocked .
2	but 0st i had to be very patient since it took a few_days for the money to be cleared , then another 00_hours for them to get the response from apple servers .
2	i sent the money on tuesday , it was recieved on thursday and i received the e_- mail telling_me that i was unlocked on saturday_morning ( a week - end , mind you ).
2	that '_s why i feel nothing but pure joy joy joy , because these_folks are real and they take care of their customers .
2	i was even so happy to know from the web designer , that the concept for the site was done in cape verde when he came here on vacation months_ago .
2	well folks , there you have it .
2	i trust them totally and i will do_business with them again and will tell all my friends about them .
2	thank_you again for this new found freedom for my iphone .
2	software was excellent , very easy to use and easy to adapt .
2	turn_around was excellent although post service was slow , especially when we were so keen to get the book .
2	when it arrived it was fantastic quality .
2	we were delighted and would definitely recommend .
2	just what i was looking for ... and great personal service .
2	passion_digital are knowledgeable in the digital space while also having a really good understanding of how to engage with the customer and get results across key digital_marketing .
2	they have the skills to build a wide_variety of website solutions and have a firm hold on cutting - edge technologies .
2	their team is also great to work with .
2	very easy and smooth website to use .
2	nice experience .
2	so impressed with your service .
2	does more than it says on the tin .
2	delivery was exactly as scheduled and the beds are fantastic .
2	we first looked at john_lewis , took a chance and saved a thousand_pounds .
2	very easy to register and print labels .
2	parcel collected the next_morning .
2	competitive price .
2	pleased with whole service .
2	a pleasant driver and a roomy coach .
2	just what we ordered .
2	extremely good service .
2	fast delivery and excellent communication .
2	we were returning customers having been so impressed with our previous purchase .
2	good service , delivery and communication .
2	would recommend .
2	i ordered a couple of items on the 00th_may and although the money has_been taken from my account , i have not had an email to say my items have been dispatched .
2	i am a new customer so i registered at the same time but when i tried to log in , it keeps saying it does not recognise my email address .
2	i have contacted qvc who say they have rectified the problem but i still cannot log in .
2	they still did not tell me when i can expect delivery .
2	i also put in orders with 0 other_companies on the same day and i got emails from them on the 00nd to say my goods have been dispatched but i have had no word from qvc .
2	not happy !
2	bought an item from their hyde store online .
2	0 days_later got a phone_call to say the store had been broken into and they had taken my item ... strange that the thieves went for my £_00 item when the store was selling £_000 items and these are still being advertised on their website so obviously the thieves did not bother with them ( perhaps they only like cheap items ??)
2	would have preferred the truth .... very disappointed as the item was for my autistic grandson who was looking_forward to getting it and now i will have to look around for another one .
2	found george_mann to be helpful and knowledgeable with his advice , open approach and trustworthy even_though i couldn_'_t proceed with him due to my circumstances
2	astonished to receive my order within 00_hours of placing it . highly satisfied with the service and the efficiency and politeness of your delivery man , i would highly_recommend uk mail to anyone
2	excellent choice of frames , probably the best customer service i have ever received and at a great price .
2	well it happened again , i fell for the good prices and promise of ' in stock ' fast delivery .
2	ordered two_weeks_ago and heard_nothing , have emailed for updates and not even had a response .
2	i have done this twice before but over the mists of time forgot just how bad this company are on delivering .
2	they will get away with it for now but long_term it is a recipe for disaster .
2	the most infuriating thing is that they mustn '_t read the multitude of reviews that complain_about their customer_services , or they do and they ignore it which must be worse .
2	they have got to realise if just one person is put off buying from them because of reviews such as this then they are losing a vast_amount of money , a fact which i find unbelievable .
2	i ordered an electronic garage_door_opener for a disabled relative .
2	delivery was fast and very well_packaged .
2	during unpacking i was surprised by the quality of the components , perfectly machined and fitting together snugly , with obvious attention to detail during design .
2	as mentioned the instructions would be a headache if used alone , but i had my laptop at the side and followed the much more user_friendly installation video on the website which made the whole_process relatively easy .
2	the door worked_perfectly the first time i tried it , i then carried_out the adjustments as advised in the setup_guide ( an easy 0 minute job ) and that was that !
2	has made me want one for my own garage , its that good !
2	handy to have a store locally as maplins stock loads of those ' hmm where the bugger can i get that ?!'
2	things !
2	decent prices and staff who know what they are talking_about .
2	only done the mail order thing once but it was cheap and quick .
2	recommended .
2	the thing is with virgin , if it is working it is great but prepare yourselves for when it isn_'_t .
2	customer_services , based abroad , are absolutely_shocking .
2	nothing to do with them actually being foreign but the fact is the phone lines are shocking , they just do not understand you , and have the most basic crib sheets in front of them to try and diagnose problems .
2	on the rare occassions when they deem it necessairy to put you through to a uk level 0 operative you feel like kissing the phone you are that grateful .
2	the package on the whole is great but i do feel deeply angry that i signed_up to the 00mb cable internet just before they decided to choke the life out of it when you use it for anything other than surfing ( what , you ordered 00mb internet and want to actually download something ?!!
2	- outrageous !)
2	i won_'_t move as they are the best there is , but once there is an_alternative i will be gone .
2	i think most of what can be said has_been said , but i want to say the best tip i have been given recently was to get the asda credit_card if you do online groceries .
2	as long as you spend more than £_00 you get free delivery and can still select your own time_slot .
2	so for us , a family of 0 , we spend around £_000 a week on online groceries , so this adds up to a £_000 saving on deliveries per year !
2	on top of that it is a reward card , so we get petrol etc on it and get vouchers in return .
2	it is from the ' santander ' group and we already have one of theirs but got the asda one without problems .
2	there is an interest free transfer period as well but i can '_t remember how long sorry .
2	hope that helps .
2	:)
2	after being with o0 and vodafone since my first mobile i was a bit_wary of going to t - mobile for no other reason than my own perceptions .
2	o0 gave_me poor reception , vodafone gave_me sleepless_nights over their customer_services , so i was in the mood for a change .
2	t - mob had the best prices at the time so i took the plunge .
2	i have been more than happy and i am into my 0th year with them .
2	my connection is superb and the allowances / dataplans are as good as any .
2	i use my i ' net allowance on an iphone 0 00_% mobile and the other 00_% tethered with my laptop , and it is great either way .
2	i can '_t see myself leaving anytime_soon as the deal i got on my iphone was great and so i expect future ' upgrades ' to be the same .
2	:)
2	i am a returning customer and although we had a problem with our first item ( a remote_control camera / car ) it was sorted in no time and with zero fuss .

2	i bought a samsung blu - ray_player on ebay mainly_due to the price .
2	when it arrived the next_day i unpacked it and found everything in the box that should be there and the player was in prestine_condition .
2	plugged it in ( 0 mins ) put a disc in and within 0 minutes total i was watching a movie in fantastic 0000p hdmi wow !!
2	at double this price i would have been amazed at the quality but at under £_00 what a great buy .
2	i will be watching for more bargains from this top seller .
2	thanks

2	i have not anything to complain_about which is a pity really .
2	i do like to have a good winge and moan now and again .
2	the only moan i have had up to now about this firm was that bought a hubsan helicopter whose transmitter battery box had a loose terminal so i rang up and told them .
2	it quite upset me when a new battery box arrived in with the post the next_day .
2	they have a great selection of spares which is totally impressive .
2	the other thing i liked was when learning to fly my helicopter ant and steve were always helpful on giving tips .
2	its a pity that wheelspin don_'_t have open days for model demonstrations .
2	thanks wheelspin ,

2	i can '_t recommend them high enough what more could i say ..
2	had a problem so went on live_chat with sammie_taylor was very helpful
2	i ahve only has the bike for two_weeks and had a few rides on the local railway path and a couple up the local hills .
2	on both the bike performed very well ( unlike me ) and took everything that was thrown at it .
2	as for merlin_cycles i have used them a few_times and like always the service was top_class .
2	delivery was fast , great value for money and the bike was virtually ready to go on delivery .
2	would definately recommend buying from merlin_cycles .
2	i bought a rudy_project stirling helmet on their tbyb scheme and i must_say that the helmet is an excellent fit and good quality , although the finish could be slightly neater .
2	the service from sport and speed has_been excellent .
2	quality product , good price , quick delivery and quick response to email question .
2	i would recommend them to anyone with confidence .
2	great purchase experience from_start to delivery .
2	very competetive , and bests price on the internet .
2	next_day free delivery was a bonus .
2	highly_recommended .
2	i cant rate this company enough , ordered television and delivery within two_days , re - ordered sound_bar , and arrived next_day to scotland .
2	telephone_call on both sales to confirm in stock and delivery date .
2	best service i have received in a long time .
2	came_across this company by chance using google .
2	have used them on a number of occasions and i have to say the service has_been exemplary .
2	the prices are great as well .
2	have recommended the site to anumber of friends .
2	well_worth considering if you need batteries
2	incredibly fast and very efficient service .
2	would use again and recommend to others
2	a jar of swarfega came damaged in transit , they replaced it straight_away no questions_asked .
2	shower_unit ordered last october ( price was good , could be a reason for that !).
2	website said 0 units in stock .
2	no shower delivered .
2	finally got through on phone ( very poor customer service on phone_calls , they don_'_t pick_up for ages , put you on hold for ever and don_'_t call back ) they said it was on it '_s way .
2	after more calls and emails i called the oft and am now taking them to court .
2	if i do get a refund and apology before going to court i will update on here .
2	update_: after sending a letter to qssupplies threatening court_action i then phoned and spoke to zia .
2	he said that i had already received a refund .
2	i checked my account while still on the phone to find this was not the case .
2	he then accepted this but refused to send me a refund and said he was happy to go to court .
2	on oft advice i sent a further , final , letter to qs .
2	they have now refunded my original amount , but ofcourse i am still out of pocket due to the number of phone_calls , the two recorded delivery letters plus the inconenience of it all .
2	however , i have still received no letter of apology or explanation .
2	i hope that they improve their customer service .
2	use them at your own_risk .
2	good choice of business phones , though tends to be pricey .
2	initial marketing suggested that i would be contacted if service was an over - provision : no such contact occurred .
2	when my phone needed repair , it was astonishingly expensive , and my queries about why were ignored .
2	i won_'_t be going back to o0 at the end of my contract .
2	ordering was simple : the price was the best available on the internet , and there was an additional introductory_discount .
2	delivery was as scheduled .
2	this was not a complex order , but it was well - executed , which is a quality of service not all companies achieve .
2	ok , so it didn_'_t actually ' fly ' but myparceldelivery worked well and delivered my parcel on time .
2	a big spanner it at bit different from usual post items but mpd coped fine .
2	having a collection_point at a local shop is a great idea ; being_able to drop a parcel off at a time to suit me helped a lot .
2	ha plastic access panel with hinged door
2	code : ha000 - 000
2	the panel was easy to install and the door is a snug_fit in the frame .
2	it looks at though it will do the job it was purchased for .
2	delivery was quick and the product was well_packed .
2	this is the second panel i have ordered .
2	i would recommend them .
2	i ordered a fly by one piece - navy and orange size 0 for my fiancée for our holiday in turkey .
2	she '_s really fussy about clothes ( typical woman !)
2	but she really liked the cozy - and wasn_'_t i in her good books , phew : d ...
2	the costume is great quality ( she looks great with it on , as well as great with it ... oops , nearly got cheeky ...) and is much_better_than i '_ve seen in the high_street_shops ( not that i spend my time looking at lady '_s swimming costumes in the shops - honest ).
2	and as the idea to treat her was a last_minute i was praying for a speedy delivery .
2	it arrived in a couple of days which was ideal , and it gave_me the time to treat_myself .
2	so i got a new cozy too .
2	result !
2	the dealings with this company have been excellent .
2	the first plaque arrived with a flaw in the slate .

2	i would have no_hesitation in recommending their services .
2	excellent service .
2	thoroughly professional .
2	highly_recommended .

2	driver very pleasent .
2	two_days i stayed in for a collection . with no joy . chatted on a live_chat . sorted .
2	they swapped me to <_external link_removed >. they came ok . not happy at all . its starts off with one parcel and could of lead to 000 ; s , very poor service . thought they had 0000 vans . ok snow i could understand not picking_up first day . but i did book it 0 days before pick_up .
2	i was looking for a new omega_seamaster , once i had decided on the model i searched the best price and service available , iconicwatches . co . uk can up with the best deal .
2	great value with all the documentation as if purchased from a shop .
2	i was very particular that i found a company that would offer me the full package - as there are many out there that do not let you have the international warranty card , which greatly de - values the watch if you want to sell onion the future !
2	i highly_recommend iconic_watches . co . uk best value , great communications and super service !
2	got me in touch with the right supplier who provided the part i needed at a great price and delivered it in super quick time !
2	posted thursday dinner time , phones received by mazuma on the friday , vouchers delivered on the saturday !
2	!
2	highly_recommended , first_class communication and service !
2	have been trying for three_days to get through to this company , to pay my disabled and elderly mothers electricity_bill , average of over an_hour eating every day regardless of the time of day , definitely will be changing provider to eon , disgraceful service !!!
2	!
2	very easy product to use with excellent results .
2	the engineer named tj arrived exactly on the dot of eight , he explained what needed to be done and the time required .
2	i found him knowledgeable and friendly and he started straight_away .
2	the job was completed withing the 00_minutes and i have full confidence in the work carried_out .
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending autoglass .
2	i am very pleased with my purchase , my glasses fitted without_any adjustments being needed .
2	the frame is stylish and the coatings give me clear vision without reflections .
2	i was looking for a reasonable price and a simple order process to quickly send some flowers to a loved one '_s funeral in london .
2	came_across this site and it fitted my requirements exactly .
2	got the tyres i wanted at the right price , right time , right place , could not get any better . perhaps knocking on your front_door to say they have just been fitted .
2	first piont of call for anyone .
2	great prices , great delivery , great communication no more to say .
2	ordered a bracket dec 00 it arrived not what i was looking for so i sent it back only to be told it was unusable and they would deduct 00_% of the purchase price .
2	as it was taken out of the packaging .
2	how else was i supposed to use it ?
2	it was taken out of the packaging laid on the floor and put straight back in the packaging and sent back .
2	( supposed to be 00 year_warranty ) they have no pictures of the damage and they have thrown out the bracket or so they say .
2	we are now taking_legal_action .
2	so whatever you do buy somewhere_else even if it costs a little more but do not i repeat do not buy from brackets r us .
2	you have been_warned
2	very quick dispatch and 000_% accurate delivery time
2	these small storage_boxes were just what i needed for my new workshop .
2	excellent , and delivered incredibly quickly
2	this was the first time i '_ve ever used on - line spectacle supply .
2	being very shortsighted (- 0 . 00 ) i have learned the glasses must be 000_% right if i am to see properly .
2	initially i chose this company because , unlike many others , they will do lenses as strong as i need .
2	i wear contact_lenses , so i am less fussy about glasses as i only wear them late at night or in emergency .
2	so i ordered one of their special deals , and for under £_00 i received an absolutely perfect pair with high refractive lenses and scratch_resistant coating .
2	their service puts high_street_opticians to shame !
2	side by side there is nothing to choose between the £_000 pair from the high_street i recently got , and my £_00 pair from glasses0you .
2	i can thoroughly_recommend them .
2	don_'_t have any_doubts_about on - line glasses !
2	excellent company very professional and what an excellent price less_than 00_% of a local company charge even with the postage !
2	no_problems what so ever with the product even getting a registered 0_yrs .
2	warranty whereas my local company was a measly 0_yrs .
2	!
2	cannot recommend this company high enough !
2	the company was fair and extremely quick at paying out , sure i could have got £_00 more on ebay , with all the hassle etc .
2	no , this company treated me fairly and had all done , cheque in hand ( just opened as the mazuma advert was on tv ) within three_days , excellent !
2	oh and almost_forgot , all so easy done !
2	highly_recommended .
2	booked next - day delivery for an exercise_bike .
2	the window i was given was from 0am to 0pm ( even_though it says 0pm if you go to the " track my order " page ).
2	yep , a 00 - hour_window .
2	nothing arrived by the deadline .
2	there was no phone_call from either the company or the courrier .
2	i tried_calling customer service at 0pm but after going through their call steering , i got a recording saying the offices were closed ( of course ).
2	phoned the next_morning .
2	was given no explanation and no apology .
2	naturally cancelled the order and won_'_t be sourcing anything through argos again .
2	don_'_t use them .
2	i have been trying to source a ford_mondeo , and i was offered the details of four main_dealers with , give - or - take , the car i was seeking , but none of the four has actually been able to say if they actually have that car - or even if or when they will be able to obtain it .
2	users of the site need to be aware that ford dealers are all fishing in the same pool and may offer a vehicle which they simply hope to be able to obtain for you at some point in the future .
2	it seems to me that this is a potential weakness in an otherwise promising model .
2	great products and service all delivered in a helpful and friendly fashion .
2	can '_t fault them
2	easy to order and the covers arrived quickly and are performing the job entirely to my satisfaction .
2	excellent service .
2	i '_ve_used this service before and found it to be perfect .
2	so , as we did our first ever cruise for our 00th_wedding_anniversary i decided to print a special book again .
2	downloaded the software , prepared all my pages and submitted the order very quickly .
2	it took a week to arrive , but the results are perfect - i guess you can '_t rush perfection .
2	the perfect solution for those special occasions .
2	i was really struggling to find a tux for my first cruise and hiring one just seemed too expensive .
2	came_across mytuxedo whilst doing an internet_search and they had everything i needed from the tux to the bow_tie and more .
2	perfect and highly_recommended
2	i was sceptical of using an oline divorce company but was recommended to divorce - online by a friend who had used their services .
2	from_start to finish the whole_process has_been completely hassle_free at a fraction of the cost of high_street solicitors .
2	i would not_hesitate to recommend their services in the future .
2	... well , i think i got all the support and answers i need from " rentalcars . com "...
2	but what i believe is fundamental ( essential ) in order to improve my customer_satisfaction in all the given situations - is for rentalcars . com to apply pressure and receive continuous feedback from its car renting companies , regarding a continuous improvement of their services towards us , beneficiaries [...] thank_you

2	they have passed me from one department to another , no manager calls me back and i have been hung_up on 0 times in a row !
2	also they hide_behind emails and not on the phone .
2	if they dont like what they hear they fob you off and then pass you to another department .
2	broken_promises galore !

2	we were out so they put my parcel in the wheelie_bin , when we got home the bin had been emptied and the parcel lost . this was the first delivery attempt [ they say that they do three }. emails are unanswered and you cannot_speak to a person . only an_idiot would put a delivery in a wheelie_bin , so what are the requirements to work at hermes ?
2	prompt delivery , good prices , user_friendly website
2	this was the easiest tyre_fitting service i have ever had it was so quick and easy from booking on line to the service from the garage they where so helpful and free coffee also half price next mot
2	we use aldi quite a lot for generally a good standard of products at a fair price , but get annoyed when basic products just disappear for a few weeks ( or longer ), sometimes being replaced by an inferior recipe .
2	one at present concerns fruit teas .
2	the diplomat berry fruits tea rightfully won some awards and has_been my brew of choice for several_years .
2	recently after a brief absence this reappeared in a new , slightly_larger box , and the new product tastes frankly awful .
2	a sweet , chemically nothing , with no " berry " flavour .
2	a quick comparison of ingredients shows a considerable reduction in the good stuff , which probably explains the lack of flavour .
2	i will return the rest of the box , and look_elsewhere for a replacement
2	great products , great prices , fast delivery , helpful staff .
2	i have ordered a few things from safercigs and they have always been very good ; good products , good prices and excellent service .

2	i would recommend this company to anyone_contemplating going ahead with a divorce and finding legal gobbledook had been a problem to you ..

2	i placed an order for several handles and their additional components and accessories .
2	usually these would have been dispatched as per the automated order but , it was spotted by a staff_member that i had made an error in my selections and i was contacted before dispatch so i could correct my order to receive the goods i actually needed .
2	i was quite impressed by this service and the quality of the goods once received .
2	i have faound them easy to order from and they keep me informed regarding the order .
2	i have placed several orders with wldbird direct and all have arrived on the specified date except the last order which was one working day late .

2	i would not recommend this company and will have to take them to court to get my money back .
2	sent me four tubes for my fish_tank , two were labelled the wrong_colour and one did not work .
2	i returned the faulty tube , when they eventually replied after many ignored attempts to contact them .

2	nothing has turned_up and have emailed them again several_times , no response , phoned them , no answer .
2	i even got failed delivery messages to some emails .

2	i would avoid this company if i were you !!

2	they only seem to reply if you mention disputing the transaction and requesting a chargeback with you credit_card company .
2	excuse for long delays is " staff sickness ".
2	must be an epidemic down there as they are ignoring my emails again !!
2	if you are thinking of buying from them , telephone them first .
2	if you get no reply , bear in mind this is what you will be faced with if you have any_problems with them !!

2	i '_ve been watching the weston gourmet offers for some time - eventually decided to jump and try them about 0_weeks_ago when they offered 00 " restaurant quality " steaks for £_00 plus delivery ; however , i was thwarted by their website having crashed , and i couldn_'_t get my order in .
2	more recently , i went for an offer via the gourmet society link , for 00 irish_grass_fed steaks for £_00 inclusive .

2	delivered to my local_store in carlisle on the day they said .
2	local staff were extremely_helpful , couldn_'_t fault the service .
2	this purchase was a 000cm satin nickel curtain_pole .
2	dealing_with fashion_interiors was hassle_free and their delivery was spot on .
2	the quality of the curtain_pole is superb and it was very easy to fit .
2	my recommendation is that a centre support be used when fitting a 000cm pole , especially when hanging heavy_weight curtains .
2	i have also fitted a 000cm pole from fashion_interiors and this does not require a centre bracket .
2	in summary " well_done fashion_interiors "
2	i have been dealing_with nature '_s best for a long while now and have always received prompt service .
2	they offer a lot of products at what i consider to be value for money prices .
2	messed my delivery option , when i rang they couldn_'_t be more helpful .
2	received rackets for my daughter next_morning at no extra_cost .
2	i have returned since that order and found them to be equally as good
2	outstanding service ordered and recieved inside 00hrs , brilliant .
2	i had trouble logging in to my account .
2	rachel guided_me through chrome_browser settings which were turned off .
2	turning them on allowed_me access .
2	thank_you
2	i purchased a ticket for the cardiff v chelsea match on tuesday_afternoon .
2	i got an immediate_confirmation via e_- mail , explaining that the purchase had to be manually checked .
2	a further e_- mail that evening confirmed approval .
2	the ticket was dispatched on wednesday and it arrived on thursday .
2	i thoroughly_enjoyed the match and would consider_using ticketbis again .
2	i bought a dyson product for considerably_less_than other_retailers , and the free delivery service was brilliant .
2	well_done to purewell_electrical , i will_certainly use them again .
2	i knew what i wanted and pixmania was the cheapest price , including delivery for the product .
2	the ordering .
2	payment process and delivery were faultless .
2	i ordered a 00 - string_guitar from this company via their website .
2	they had a telephone_number to call so i first made sure they had the guitar in stock - the salesperson was friendly and helpful and they did have the guitar as stated on their website .
2	the guitar arrived less_than 00_hours_later at the time i was told it would arrive .
2	it was well_packed and i '_m very happy with it .
2	i will be buying another guitar soon from this company and theirs will be amongst the first websites i go to for musical products from now on .
2	first_class service .
2	thanks reidy_'_s .
2	the website feels old and clunky for starters .
2	i had a few 000 errors on product pages which hardly instils confidence .
2	i did however order a microwave because it was the one i wanted and the price seemed ok .
2	i had to register with the website and to do so was forced to give unnecessary information that i did not want to give about myself .
2	there seemed to be no option not to retain my card information .
2	what i ordered was on next_day delivery and it did not arrive next_day .
2	i was given a tracking_number in an email but when i entered this number on the tracking page at the comet website it gave_me a 000 " page not found " error .
2	i looked for a telephone_number to call customer_services and only found and 00000 number which was charged at 00p_per_minute .
2	it is now the day after the day on which this product was supposed to arrive and i want to go out to see an old friend before he moves to india but i am still_waiting for my delivery and am unable to even attempt to find out what might have happened to my order without spending 00p a minute ( more i think because my phone is a virgin one ).
2	i would spend the money on the phone_call if i thought it would get me anywhere but i '_m_sure i will be told that once the item is with the courier there is nothing they can do so why waste money .
2	disgraceful service but only just less_than average for the uk .
2	i will never be using comet again .
2	i was looking for a marshall as000d acoustic_amp and had some very fishy service from the music_equipment retailer i usually use ( if you know what i mean ).
2	i also had " bait and switch " experiences from some of the other_retailers i called whereby new stock was claimed on web - sites that then turned_out to be ex - showroom stock which was " only out of the box for a day or two - honest ".
2	yeah_right , more probably a month or two and possibly pounded at full volume by every aspiring ac / dc fan who walked in the shop .
2	it only takes a second to damage a speaker so i wasn_'_t too happy to have my time wasted by these " bait and switch " merchants .
2	andertons was a breath of fresh_air and i was treated with respect as a customer from the start .
2	the man with whom i spoke on the phone gave_me his_name without being asked .
2	i called on a friday_morning at about 00 am and when i told_him i needed next_day saturday delivery he told me that it wasn_'_t a problem and that they had 0 units ( as stated on the website ).
2	he said he ' d check out which stores the units were at and call me back within 00_minutes .
2	he called me back in 0 minutes took my credit_card_details and said he ' d email me as soon as the shipping had been arranged .
2	i checked my email about 00_minutes later and found confirmation of the order .
2	i also went to their website and sure_enough the stock level on the product page had dropped to " 0 ".
2	i had another email about half an_hour after that with a ups tracking_number on it and advice to the effect that tracking would be active at about 0 o ' clock that evening when the package had been picked_up from andertons and delivered to the ups warehouse .
2	sure_enough i clicked on the tracking_link just after 0 and it was logged as having arrived .
2	i looked at the tracking_info later that evening and early the next_morning and every_stage of the route was logged so i knew_exactly where it was .
2	a ups man was at my door shortly_after 0 o ' clock on saturday_morning and i plugged in the amp and was playing guitar through it a few minutes after that .
2	andertons had taken 00_hours to get the amp to me on a saturday !
2	if i had to describe the service in a few words i ' d call it " an american standard of service in the uk ".
2	i look_forward to using andertons for all my future gear purchases .
2	i '_m surprised at how i '_m now being treated by dolphin .
2	i '_ve bought gear from them before and they were ok but " it '_s all over now baby blue ".
2	i wanted a new amp for my birthday .
2	i ordered one on wednesday by telephone for next_day delivery .
2	i found it for £_00 less at an on - line retailer that i ' d never used but thought that i ' d order it from dolphin because i ' d never had a problem with them and i trusted them .
2	i was told it was in stock and there wouldn_'_t be any problem .
2	this day was 0 days before my birthday so ...
2	i was going to have an amp on my birthday wasn_'_t i ?
2	i ' d even taken a few_days off work to enjoy my birthday_present so what could go_wrong ?
2	i waited and waited_patiently .
2	no amp .
2	i called on friday and was told that it would be sent out immediately .
2	the following_tuesday i called again only to be told that they did not have the amp in stock .
2	they offered me a shop - soiled one at a discount .
2	i said that i wanted a full_refund .
2	the money is now tied up with them and i can '_t afford to order one from somewhere_else until i get the money back into my account .
2	my birthday is now 0 days away and there is little prospect of me having an amp in my possession by then .
2	very disappointing .
2	i ordered some a euros for delivery on a day i would be at home .
2	the exchange_rates was competitive and delivery charge more reasonable than other_providers .
2	delivery was duly made on the day so i cannot_fault the service .
2	good were easy to select online and pay for .
2	delivery was very prompt and goods were packaged well and all present .
2	new laptop arrived exactly when advised and the communication from the delivery company was very organised .
2	simplyacer confirmed the order within one business day and kept me fully_updated_throughout .
2	absolutely no concerns and would happily use them again .
2	it '_s good , quick , convenient , etc .
2	but expensive - not value for money really
2	if i could be_bothered to shop around , i ' d probably get a better deal .
2	i think my health issues are pretty minor but they bump up the premium .
2	the option in previous years to exclude them from cover has_been removed .
2	i renewed with wft because i ran_out of time to shop around .
2	this will probably be the last_year i use them .
2	the people on the phone are excellent .
2	the cover is good and the documentation is clear .
2	given that i use the cover for winter sports , there '_s no easy " card " or single sheet of paper that i can carry around when i '_m out .
2	other_providers offer this .
2	remotes arrived quickly and worked as_described - setup was fairly easy .
2	very happy with the service - thanks .
2	don_'_t normally do reviews , but really impressed with this company , and their product ( tractor trailer for garden ) - well_done , thanks .
2	very easy buying experience , product well_packaged .
2	very good delivery considering how far it came , and i could track it all the way .
2	ordered steering parts for my sons maverick which had broken three_days before we were going on holiday .
2	i used the next_day courier option and they arrived before we went .
2	very happy boy and dad .
2	thank_you for brilliant service .
2	one of the best online experiences i have come_across with excellent communication to any questions .
2	highly_recommended !!
2	!
2	excellent customer service and deal with orders efficiently with fast shipping and competitive_prices .
2	in my opinion this is a company who charge a fair price and do exactly_what they say they will do .
2	i received my purchase within 00_hours well_packaged and exactly as_described .
2	the product is good and the price was fair if not excellent against the competition .
2	my total purchase was over £_000_gbp , so i benefited_from the multi purchase discount and shipping was free ( or at_least built into the price .)
2	i will buy from healthspark again in the future and i am not affiliated with them in case you think this is too good a review .
2	we have had several chairs from this company .
2	in the past the chairs have always been good but this time the chair seat split within 0 days .
2	i don_'_t know what i should do for the best .
2	within one working hour of putting my comments on line i received a call from the supplier customer service apologizing for the problems that i had experienced .
2	after a quick check of the seat serial_number i was informed that a new seat base was being dispatched to me today .
2	i would recommend this company to anyone who_wants good value for money followed_by an excellent customer service .
2	a company you can trust .
2	it is so nice to see this company finally getting the caning it deserves on the web - my advice is to read the reviews and then walk_away .
2	i had a payg phone with a large_amount of money in credit which i used as a backup to my contract phone with o0 .
2	i used to make a diary entry to make a call at_least once every 0 months so i could keep the number active .
2	however , the one and only time i forgot , with no warning whatsoever , vodafone disconnected the number and i lost all the credit .
2	when i phoned up to query it i was read the terms and conditions by 0 different customer service officers and told to write to head_office , but they will say the same thing - so they had effectively stolen my money and stuck two fingers up at me .
2	i will never touch vodafone again and i am pleased to say that my experience has persuaded many friends and colleagues to steer_well clear and when my company renews it '_s mobile_phone contract , which is a multi - million_pound contract , i will do everything i can to influence the decision to ensure that vodafone does not get it !
2	i very rarely hope that a company goes_bust , but the sooner it happens to vodafone the happier i will be !
2	had an orange payg_sim which had some credit left on it , so i thought i would transfer the sim to ee to use the 0g data .
2	after_reading the reviews on here i predicted to my work_colleagues what would happen and to my surprise i was right .
2	0st phone_call to ask about transferring number and credit - was told no problem will be done in 00_hours ... guess_what .... didn_'_t happen .
2	0nd phone_call to find out why it hadn_'_t happened - was told puk had been requested but transfer had not been actioned ; was promised the transfer of credit and number would be done within 00_hours .
2	00_hours_later my number is transferred .... but guess_what .... the credit wasn_'_t !
2	0rd phone_call to ask where my credit was - could not understand a word the call_center person said ; i had to explain the situation 0 times before she understood my problem .
2	i was put on hold for 00_minutes , then she came back and told me she was escalating the problem and would phone me back within 0 hour .
2	0 hours passed and guess_what .... no call !
2	0th phone_call to find out what was going on - had to go through the same process again , in pigeon english , to be told that there was no credit on my old orange account , so no transfer to do .
2	i got annoyed with the guy , who then checked the account and admitted that he was wrong .
2	i have been personally assured that my credit will be transferred and that he will make_sure it happens ....... in 0 to 00_hours !
2	guess_what .... i think this review will be amended to include 0th phone_call !
2	**_update **
2	you guessed it , 0th phone_call , this time to the english sales_team to find out what was going on ( again ) - i explained the situation , the guy then read out the message that had been recorded on the system by the indian_call_centre in my previous call and neither he or his manager could understand what it was trying to say , so he is raising another transfer .... so it continues !
2	** another update **
2	0th phone_call - apparently my credit is still on the orange account and not the ee account , but the orange account doesn_'_t exist_anymore .
2	i was told that the original transfer was not done properly and another attempt would be made , which would take ..... you guessed it upto 00_hours to complete .
2	why do i get the feeling that i will be phoning again in 00_hours to go through the same process all over again .... never witnessed such utter_incompetence .
2	oh i did get my first and only apology , but only after i pointed_out that no - one had the common decency to apologise for this joke of a situation .
2	i urge_anyone_thinking_about joining ee , save your money and go_elsewhere they are a complete digrace ; i have complained to ofcom and will be contacting_trading_standards first thing on monday - i would actually like a full_refund of my credit so i don_'_t have to deal with this company again !
2	!
2	i told amazon over a year_ago that i would not shop with them while they use yodel and since then they have used their own extremely reliable couriers .
2	however , this week i placed and order and my heart_sank when i saw yodel was the delivery firm and once again my experience has_been predictably bad .
2	the package was due to be delivered on friday 00th_april_0000 , so i took this day of work to be at home .
2	i got home from work on the 00th_april to find a card on the door_mat stating that an attempt at delivery had been made .
2	not a problem , i went_onto myyodal and rearranged delivery for the 00th_april .
2	i checked the tracking on the morning of the 00th and it stated that the parcel is still at the depot .
2	so i rang customer_services and queried this and was told that they can '_t contact the driver but he is aware that i need the parcel today ( 00th ).
2	i mentioned while i was on the phone that the mobile number left on the card was actually for a local gas company , but yodel confirmed the number was correct and told me to phone it .
2	i phoned the number and found myself going to the voice_mail for a gas and property_maintenance company - so are yodel now using gas engineers to deliver parcels ?
2	after_posting my review i received the reply shown below from yodel which states that my parcel is out for delivery !
2	update_:
2	i telephoned the courier and he informed me that he is in scotland and if i really want the package he can get his wife to deliver it as it is in his shed ( which is encouraging ), otherwise delivery would be monday_evening .
2	i told_him to send the package back to amazon !
2	i contacted amazon and asked for a complete refund and told them that i will no_longer buy from them while they continue to use yodel as a courier !
2	i have replied to the e_- mail posted below which just shows the level of sheer_incompetence of this company as i would like to know how my item was out for delivery when the courier was actually hundreds of miles_away in scotland and my parcel was is in his shed - no answer required yodel , i have drawn my own_conclusions !
2	so thank_you yodel for once again making me waste a day of my annual_leave waiting in for a parcel that was never going to turn_up .
2	i urge any supplier to desist from using yodel and i will never do_business with anyone that uses them as a courier :
2	i will make_sure that i keep all of the evidence for this situation so that when a " reputation " company comes along in 0 years time ( yes this has happened ) and ask me for proof then i will be able to accommodate !
2	first_class service , third class prices , ditch the banks and save your cash
2	great prices and helpful staff but had to phone them for delivery advice and place a order for £ 0 , 000 and it cost me £ 0 . 00p on their premium_rate phone no 00000000000 .
2	this is a charge which should be waived when placing a order
2	mr c harrand
2	ordered a pair of bose_headphones as a christmas_present .
2	best price and prompt delivery from hifix .
2	great selection of memory for pc '_s , memory_sticks and cameras .
2	i bought an ipad 0 and it worked great .
2	it developed a fault that was tricky to resolve .
2	studentcomputers . co . uk bent_over_backwards to help me .
2	communication and support was fast and clear at all times .
2	such nice people to deal with , too .
2	i needed my ipad fixing fast as i use it for work .
2	it was bank_holiday so i thought it would be at_least a few_days but no - they fixed it the same day !
2	they even stayed late to allow me to collect it after they had closed for the bank_holiday .
2	how '_s that for customer service ?
2	pretty brilliant , i think .
2	it meant that i could carry on working which i really appreciated .
2	things will go_wrong when you buy electronics .
2	it '_s simply a fact of life .
2	what matters is how good the company is at putting things right - and you cannot ask for better service than from studentcomputers . co . uk
2	i will be going back to them and so will everyone_else that i know because i '_ll be recommending them .
2	buy in complete_confidence .
2	my dealing_with this company have been very efficent and the staff are very helpful .
2	i phoned after 0pm on a wednesday , as soon as i had put the phone down i had the receipt in an email and the printer was at my door by 0am the next_morning .
2	i will_definitely recommend this company to others .
2	looking to replace existing ski trousers and was helped by friendly staff to find the air i needed .
2	so whilst only looking , bought pair straight_away .
2	very good quality selection and service !
2	i tried this supplier after_reading other reviews by other customers and found a good cost_effective way of obtaining proprietary treatments for our dog .
2	very good service and i would recommend them to others .
2	hi , received the homeplugs today ( wed ) very fast processing of my order and well_packed .
2	they were very easily installed and work very well .
2	i watched a movie without losing the signal halfway_through , very good reception and easy to use .
2	would recommend to anyone .
2	thank_you .
2	once again i have used insureandgo uk for our anual holiday insurance .
2	great price but most of all it is so easy and reasonable to screen online for medical_conditions to be covered .
2	i used to have to phone companies and then wait for them to get back to me with an answer as to if they could screen my wife and me , not any more .
2	this company to me is the best and easiest holiday insurance company to deal with online and i have never even had to speak to them .
2	as a pc technician i needed a refurbished_pc running windows 0 .
2	i wanted it at a good price , delivered quickly and working in minutes .
2	that '_s exactly_what i got .
2	fantastic service and i look_forward to dealing_with microdream in the future .
2	excellent product , price and support with confirmation e_- mail and data tracking .
2	i turned to tredz after a nightmare experience trying to buy a bike online from another major , high_street chain .
2	in brief , from the moment i made my first enquiry with tredz , they were constantly in touch with me , keeping_me up to date .
2	they offered next_day delivery for free and the bike turned_up at 0 :_00am on the set day .
2	the bike was perfectly set_up , needing just the essentials ( seat / pedals / bars ) altering and it was ready to ride inside 0 / 0 an_hour .
2	i took the bike out for a test_ride and everything else worked 0st time .
2	i '_ll defintely be going back to tradz in the future .
2	i ordered a bike from evans .
2	because there wouldn_'_t be anyone at home during the working week i opted to pay £_00 for a saturday a . m . delivery .
2	guess_what - 0 :_00pm arrived and no sign of the bike .
2	phoned evans who said there must be a problem and they ' d call back ' very soon '.
2	an_hour later i was phoning them again .
2	ended_up cancelling the whole order .
2	would i buy from them again ?
2	never !
2	i recently_bought a new camera through jessops website .
2	knowing nobody would be home to receive the package during the working week i opted for a so - called guaranteed saturday_morning delivery and paid the extra fee .
2	the package never showed up on saturday .
2	on enquiring with jessops i was told that the package was in the hands of parcelfarce - had i known this at first , that would have been enough to make me take my custom elsewhere .
2	as it was , it was several days_later when i finally got my goods , having wasted a whole saturday at home being assured by jessops that the parcel would arrive and having had to ask someone to wait at home the following week rather_than risk the package disappearing into the black whole known as parcelfarce .
2	i '_ve still not received a refund for the extra postage they robbed me of .
2	would i buy from jessops again - no !
2	i ordered a package from a reputable_company .
2	couldn_'_t have the goods delivered during the working week because nobody would be home so i paid the extra for a saturday_morning delivery .
2	guess_what - no sign of the parcel .
2	checked the tracking_number to find that the parcel had arrived in the local parcelfarce depot at 0 : 00 in the morning but they couldn_'_t manage to get it into a van for delivery .
2	in my opinion they '_ve stolen the money from me because they charged a premium for their so - called saturday_morning delivery .
2	the sooner this bunch of jokers are sold to a competent company the better .
2	myself and 0 other ladies were picked_up at faro_airport by a meet and greet gentleman , taken promptly and picked_up a few_days from the same spot .
2	the man was very friendly and luckily the same man came for us on our return .
2	will_definitely use this suntransfers again !
2	my husbands barbour_coat arrived next_day as promised and the free_gift was not suitable when it arrived .
2	i e_- mailed and asked to swap this and was told it was no trouble and just use the return_label and choose another item .,
2	very happy with the product .
2	my last ghd '_s lasted at_least 0 years with every day use .
2	well_worth the money .
2	when recently purchasing a new direct economy 0 cylinder and wilo heating_pump for my son .
2	i received a prompt reply to my e_- mailed enquiry on the cylinder and both items where delivered promptly on the promised dates to scotland , including a telephone_call to confirm the day and anticipated time for the larger item .
2	i chose this company from a number found on the internet .
2	being more local to where i live in scotland , compared to others contacted further south , they provided a very good friendly service with no_hassle during the quotation process .
2	once i decided to proceed with their recommendation the purchase was simple with clear_guidance on completing the necessary forms .
2	i regularly sell a few bits and bobs on ebay and always use parcel0gofor the heavier_items .
2	always reliable and deliver quickly , which helps my ebay feedback . today i had a problem tracking a parcel to madeira , fortunately emma , on live_chat had it solved in minutes . excellent service
2	this service was great ... everything_went like_clockwork ...
2	picked my motorhome up on time ...
2	rang me to say it needed some work ...
2	returned my vehicle to me on the same morning with an explanation of the fault ...
2	i solved the fault myself & returned the motorhome the next_day at 00 . 00 noon ... new mot by 00 . 00 ...
2	brilliant .
2	i can '_t praise them enough ... all this for 00 quid ...
2	cheers
2	great price , good , helpful staff and punctuality . being a regular cross_channel user i have wasted more time than i care to remember waiting for delayed sailings - not so with myferrylink .
2	i went for the diamond package and was very pleased with just how simple a potentially - stressful process turned_out to be .
2	the staff were helpful and patient with my enquiries , which related mainly to clarification of a couple of points on the acknowledgement of service form .
2	anyway , all went_smoothly and my decree absolute arrived a couple of weeks_ago -- still celebrating !
2	;-)
2	football pun . sponsors of the hornets ! easy to use and immeadiate payment .
2	see you in 00 months when my contract_runs out
2	after spending five years on ebid as a buyer and seller , i can_honestly_say it has_been a pleasure .
2	their customer service is the best i have encountered on the internet , full stop .
2	a request for help is answered swiftly and with a real sense of purpose .
2	you will not get a stock answer to a question you did not ask , or , even worse , ignored .
2	the sellers i have encountered have all been responsive and happy to reply to enquires .
2	try ebid , ask questions and just have a browse , i am sure you will like it too .
2	i am an online retailler with over ten_years experience .
2	before that i was a director of a freight / courier company in london for an equal amount of time .
2	so i think i have pretty_much heard and witnessed all that can happen from both_sides of the business .
2	i thought i would give parcel_hero a try .
2	after_reading all the hype on their site , i ordered a collection for a customer in singapore .
2	it was supposed to be collected on the following_day with ups .
2	they failed to arrive .
2	after numberous phone_calls to parcel_hero , i was reliably assured that they would be along on the following_day to collect .
2	the customer service agent assured my wife on the day that she " would remain in the office until the package was collected ."
2	they never collected and , sure_enough the agent went home .
2	what followed was profoundly pathetic .
2	parcel_hero decided to imply a whole catalogue of childish excuses rather_than take_responsibility for their shortfall as a shipping agent .
2	they even went so_far as to try and blame me ?
2	i asked for a refund , the squrming and wittering was embarrassing to hear , i had to wait days for the money to be returned and in the end i had to place a claim through paypal .
2	with good cutomer service they could have turned the situation to their advantage , resolved the issues quickly and they would still have me as a customer .
2	rubbish ..
2	i needed some good quality swimming_goggles for my family , my first and only choice was swimshop .
2	swimshop saved me an expensive journey into my local city and the goods arrived within a couple of days .
2	the goods were first_class and i will be back .
2	as reliable as ever , looked at a few other battery suppliers but eventually came back to battery_force as their prices are cheaper and the service is excellent .
2	ordered a lawnmower online , couldn_'_t have been easier and it arrived the next_day really well_packed .
2	impressive service .
2	i '_ve_used bestbathrooms twice_now and both_times were problem free and delivered quickly without damage .
2	the choice is amazing and i will_certainly use them again .
2	the least expensive i could_find on the internet and still phenomenal service .
2	nothing else i can say .
2	helpful website , good price , prompt service and very helpful staff .
2	i ordered a wrong part in error , they efficiently arranged for the part to be replaced with the correct_part .
2	very impressed , would use again .
2	the product was delivered within the supplied time and was in excellent condition
2	excellent service .
2	great product .

2	?
2	i '_m so pleased i decided not to choose my new glasses at vision_express , although they had some nice frames it was difficult to decide which ones to choose and the cost for extra thin varifocals was high .
2	with glasses_direct i got to try the frames at home over a few_days , more time to make up my mind which frames were most suited , also gave_me the opportunity to get opinions of family and close friends .
2	i also had a slight_problem with my current glasses on distance viewing which were resolved as well , so all in all im very pleased with the service , specs and price .
2	also if you complete your order through a cashback website you get a further discount , highly_recommended .........

2	the lights arrived very well_packaged minimising the chances of any breakages .
2	very professional job .
2	not only do they seem to have the cheapest prices , but the website actually informs you of other cheaper products you may wish to consider .
2	delivery didn_'_t take long , and we were impressed by the little forklift appearing out of the lorry to bring our pallets straight to the drive with minimum_fuss - very pro .
2	not much to say - the goods arrived quickly and well - packaged .
2	one of the products i wanted didn_'_t have a clear manufacturers ' description , so they contacted them on my behalf to check the product would do what i needed .
2	package arrived promptly and well_packaged .
2	good company - would use again .
2	ordered goods online , a few minutes later i received a phone_call telling_me some of the items were not compatible to be used together so did i wish to change an item .

2	!
2	i believe i am one of the first people in the country to get the g0 , and at a cracking price ... very well_done bestcameras .
2	only the slightest hint of criticism i could make was the manner of the call_taker when phoning to confirm a point prior to order , not the friendliest of souls .

2	i shall reccomend without_reservation .
2	thanks guys .

2	don_'_t bother trying to find a cheaper site .
2	it was by luck that i came_across hostelbrokers , but it saved me 00_% on any price on other_sites for my room in sydney , after i had spent hours comparing .
2	they have a great variety and i only needed to put a 00_% deposit down where most others want it all paid up front .
2	brilliant .

2	this store has terrible staff , and managment .
2	they are rude , arogant and extremely unhelpful .
2	they will do their up most not to do an exchange or a refund , reciept or no reciept .
2	i have had more than one problem with this branch .
2	store assistant " amanda " is particualy rude and has a very clever attitude , i think she things she owns the whole company .
2	store manager andy is very poorly_trained and not management material at all .
2	i have never had any trouble or bad service at other argos stores , just keighley , so stay_away from there if you think you may need to return anything .
2	in fact stay_away full stop , not a nice store at all .
2	i hear the same about the store from friends , family , and just people i know passing me in the street , keighley argos has a terrible reputation , especially regarding its staff .
2	black_circles is so easy , great web_site you can '_t go_wrong .
2	tyre size then loads of choice .
2	get on it .
2	cloud 0 is the only website i '_ve_used , i only recently converted to vaping , so i can '_t compare them to other_sites , i can however tell you that the 0 orders i '_ve placed with them have both arrived very promptly and very nicely_packaged .
2	you '_ll get emails every_step of the way so you '_ll always be informed of the status of your order .
2	they seem to have plenty of choice on website and there is a great forum packed with plenty of information .
2	cloud 0 gets my vote and i '_ll certainly be back .
2	i was very pleased with this company , reliable friendly service would recommend to anyone will be using them again in the future competitive_rates and was very pleased .
2	they phoned me after only having the car for one hour and said my car had passed the mot apart_from the indicator bulb which was the wrong_colour but they used their common_sense and just changed it there and then .
2	my mot only cost £_00 . 00 i was absolutely_thrilled as i had been expecting a lot more
2	i ordered an item on the friday_afternoon and it was delivered on the saturday_morning , what a fast service that was and i will most definately recommend you to every one i know .
2	i have used milityary 0st for a few items over the last_year or so and have been satisfied with the items that i have ordered and the good thing is you are not waiting an age for your orders to come eithe , usually around two to three_days on average .

2	plus i received notifications via_text_telling_me what was happening with the delivery , when dispatched and when delivered etc .
2	so not only am i in the good books with my wife , i am also in the good books , ( for now ) with my mother in law .

2	i '_ve bought items from several suppliers over the years , but i regularly return to simply_supplements because the goods always arrive quickly , they have never made a mistake and their prices are as competitive as any .
2	i wanted a particular_brand of garden obelisk new to the market .
2	charlies had the small one but not the larger .
2	not only did they get me three they phoned back ( twice ) to inform_me what was going on .
2	unlike many firms , postage_charges were not at rip - off levels and the items arrived pronto .
2	ordered an ixus 00 canon digital_camera on 0th_august_0000 .
2	next_day i found a couple of sites that really shook me .
2	reports of bad service and undelivered goods .
2	i sent them numerous e_- mails_advising them of my concerns and each one was answered_promptly and efficiently .
2	i was given a tracking code to keep in touch with my order .
2	i had an anxious wait but my camera was delivered before expected and well_packaged .
2	i have no doubt that some people have had a bad_experience and fully sympathise with them .

2	i would probably deal again with se if the price is right .
2	peter , belfast
2	i needed to send a small parcel and checked collect_+ and royal_mail for their prices .
2	collect_+ was cheaper .
2	it was very easy to follow the on - line form to pay and print out an address slip .
2	my collect_+ point is quite close so it only tool about 00_minutes from the time i decided to use collect_+ to the time i dropped_off my parcel which was delivered the following_morning .

2	i placed an order on line with serenataflowers . com the site was easy to navigate and i received an immediate email conformation of order .
2	i also received an email confirmation of despatch .
2	our friend loved the flowers .
2	i have used serenataflowers . com once before also without_any_issues .
2	the shed that i ordered was great well built and easy to put_together however customer service was terrible and shedstore was not able to resolve a simple problem .
2	the shed was to be delivered in mid april_0000 .
2	i rang shedstore the day before to find out whether it would be a morning or afternoon delivery .
2	i was called back and told that it would be an afternoon delivery .
2	i therefore went out in the morning and came back just before 00 : 00 to find the shed part stacked in the drive .
2	no delivery paperwork had been left , there were no assembly_instructions and the roll of roof felt was ripped and had holes in .
2	had i been at home , i would not have accepted the roof felt .
2	i immediately contacted shedstore who emailed me the instructions and asked for a photpograph of the damaged felt .
2	i immediately sent a photograph .
2	that was on 00th_april .
2	i sent a follow_up email on the 00th_april because i hadn_'_t had a response to my first email .
2	i then started telephoning them .
2	i must have made 0 - 0 phone_calls to them .
2	they are always very pleasant on the phone and promised that i would get a replacement felt sheet quickly or that someone from the manufacturer would call .
2	none of this happened until 0th_may ( about 0_weeks after i notified them of the damage ) and guess_what ... the new roof felt was cut about 00mm too short so could not be used .
2	luckily a friend had a part roll of felt so i used this instead .
2	i would not use shedstore again .
2	there are many similar companies out there and i would hope that at_least one would have a better customer service department .
2	i thought that ironmongerydirect had a good , easily navigatable website .
2	i was sent status update emails and the product was delivered very quickly .

2	did not know of this company until i " surfed the net " looking for shower room equipment .
2	having retired from a management position some years_ago i am well aware of the difficulties involved in providing quality goods on time and at a competitive price .
2	this company ticked all the boxes and i would have no_hesitation in recommending them to anyone looking for a first_class experience throughout !
2	ps .
2	loved the rubber duck !

2	i sent my sony_xperia z to gadget_panda only to receive an email_saying they couldn_'_t accept it as one of the water indicators had changed color .
2	i was shocked to hear this as i hadn_'_t even tested the waterproof capabilities of the phone and it had never even been anywhere_near water .
2	when i received the phone back i along with my wife opened all the flaps covering the ports on the phone and all the water indicators were still white .
2	i emailed gadget_panda back but was told that at_least two people check each phone received and they were adamant that one of the water indicators was red .
2	they suggested i check again which i did and they are definitely all still white .
2	i again emailed and was told that as they no_longer had the phone they could not verify this .
2	so i wasted money on postage sending my perfectly ok phone to gadget_panda only to be told a lie as to the received condition .
2	something has obviously gone_wrong with their checking procedure and now they are insinuating that i have dodgy eyesight or that i haven_'_t checked all my phones ports or that i am lying .
2	this whole_experience has_been a waste of time and effort and i have paid postage_costs for no reason .
2	i am not happy and am in the process of finding out what my rights are and taking this matter further .
2	after various emails i have had my postage fully refunded and i thank gadget_panda for that .
2	only one thing i can say about chinese_motorcycle_parts they are a very good firm to deal with . that is way i have given 0_stars .
2	i placed my order for a galaxy ace phone on the 00th of november and it is now 0th of december and still have no phone . i have phoned got no joy , sent e_- mails someone will get back to you that is the answer i keep getting still hoping i will get a reply to say when my phone will be on its way if ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2	as a follow_up to response to my last rating : there was no apology , and there was no offer of a refund .
2	instead , a clear statement that " all you could do was send out a new one ".
2	in fairness , i did receive a very polite email from the company , today , which returned my money to my account .
2	it '_s a shame , though , that this had to happen as they were out of stock of the unit ordered and the next best unit of its type so were not actually able to rectify the problem
2	in a speedy manner .
2	thank_you for returning the payment and for the polite update .
2	my daughter gave_me a 0d_crystal of my granddaughter , great - grandson ( charlie ), my wife and me .

2	hi , purchased from ipsl after many hours trawling the web , although initially i thought they were expensive compared to some other manufactures of this product but i only wanted to fit this ceiling product once , the delivery and customer service was very good on unpacking you could see the quality of the product info on the web_site on how to fit was easy to follow .

2	nothing much more i can say , it all went well .
2	on line site was easy to navigate from finding the item i required to paying for it , kept me informed all the way to actual delivery by tracking my item what a great combination the two companies have for pleasing their customers from_start to finish .
2	order some flowers on thursday last_week to be delivered on friday and they didnt arrive or on saturday or today !
2	just spoke to someone on the live support and after asking me all the same question i had to fill out to get on the live_chat , he said there has_been a system error so they didnt get delivered .
2	i asked_him for them to be delivered tomorrow then and he said he cant do that as its past the cut_off date !
2	i told_him he missed my cut_off date by 0 days so he should be ale to get them delivered tomorrow .
2	after alot of him not really understanding what i was saying , we agreed they will be delivered on wednesday .
2	we shall see !!
2	kind of too late on wednesday though , ruined the moment !
2	!
2	i have ordered items from offtek on a number of occasions and each time i received the items within one or two_days of placing the order ( depending on the time of day placed ).
2	the item i purchased was a ' startech 0 . 0mm 0 - pin to 0 x 0 - pin 0 . 0mm headset adaptor - m / f x 0 '.
2	the order was processed quickly and , more to the point , i was kept_fully_informed of its progress .
2	overall i am completely_satisfied with the service i recieved from this company and will_certainly use them again .
2	the rug arrived in double quick time and was exactly as shown on the web_site .
2	.
2	the stitch around the outer corners of the rug looks a little thin but time will tell if it stands up to wear and tear .
2	cant_fault the price but if i am being a bit picky its a shame they didn_'_t knock off the vat which doesn_'_t apply to deliveries in the channel_islands .
2	i needed a battery for my father in laws bosch corless drill that is now obsolete .
2	toolbox is the place to come as they provided exactly_what was needed at a very competitive price and speedy delivery
2	i replaced my old thompson digibox with a new sky one supplied by sat buyer .
2	the team are very helpful answering my vat query in minutes .
2	the box arrived in a couple of days with simple to follow_instructions and after a short call to sky to initiate the new card box combination i was up and running .
2	the price was very competitive and the company gives a full vat refund for purchases outside the eu ie jersey which is not always the case with on line purchases from other_companies .
2	i would really recommend this company 0_star
2	i keep shopping around to find the lowest_prices on supplements .
2	i always end up ordering from supplement_warehouse .
2	it '_s hard to believe that they always have a better price even with the shipping charges .

2	the price was better_than other_companies and i got an extra hex driver as well .

2	so all in all buy here you won_'_t be disappointed .
2	chad

2	i have also purchased a laptop from their sister company save on laptops and had a similar experience .

2	i needed a toslink switch and did a quick search online ..
2	i found lindy '_s online store and the product in no time ..
2	ordered the product one evening and had it delivered to me two_days_later ..
2	fantastic !
2	and the switch itself is great - carries a full 000khz signal , unlike many and works faultlessly .
2	very happy !
2	:)
2	as always , the watch arrived swiftly , in perfect_condition and at a great price !
2	the reviews on the watch were right - the watch looks even better ' in the flesh ' than in the photographs .
2	i can '_t believe_how light it is either , for a mechanical movement .
2	anyhow , thanks again .
2	no doubt i '_ll be back to purchase a watch from you again !
2	:)

2	i '_ve known this business for about 00 years from their early day in former farm buildings .
2	these days it '_s all very slick and the saxophones all play well due to their excellent service dept .
2	the staff are knowledgeable and friendly - in fact it '_s more like calling on friends .
2	there '_s never any pressure .
2	the people in their london shop are just as friendly .
2	you will not find a better selection of sax stuff anywhere_else in the world .
2	i was searching for an american sounding speaker for my amp and bought an eminence maverick from lean business .
2	the service was very fast and it was really well_packed ( overkill to be honest but better safe than sorry !)
2	and tracked through dpd giving an accurate_eta .
2	i was happy with the price and all in all , an outstanding experience .
2	this is the second time i have bought from them through ebay and i thoroughly_recommend them based on my experience .
2	seems like a decent business looking to provide excellent service .
2	i have been using these_people for several_years - i just occasionally sell things on ebay and need to send them overseas or even within the uk .
2	i have found the prices to be good and basically you get to choose corporate rates from some of the big courier firms so you get quick collection and tracking data .
2	i don_'_t have time to go searching for the best deal for any given shape or size of package o a given destination .
2	i '_ve_used tge for uk , denmark , hong_kong , japan , usa and a few others i '_ve probably forgotten about .
2	recommended .
2	googled for a ski_helmet and found some good ones in the sale .
2	dispatch was quick and my daughter is very pleased with the helmet .
2	pleasantly_surprised at what i got for my old phone and the process was pain - free .
2	good first purchase from this company , with good commas and fast delivery too so_far they must be highly_recommended +++++
2	have used gamola_golf for years_now and there products and prices and there fast delivery too cannot be_beaten anywhere
2	good product , good price fast delivery too highly_recommended +++++++
2	always helpful always there when you need them but charge a bit too much to advertise products
2	cant recommend them highly_enough as the product , price , postage very quick too so don_'_t need to go on further highly_recommended ++++++
2	one of the best services i have used
2	i used boiler_juice several_times now , i use it simply cause its the easy way to get fairly cheap oil ... i know by ring around i can get it cheaper .. but normally with group discount etc it works out about the same .
2	normally the delivery side is speedy , but this time boiler_juice choose a different supply , they texted me a date , this day came and went ... no oil ... in fact they delivered late pm two_days_later than their text ,[ edit .. i note that another has moaned about this supplier - bj take_note ] but cant moan as its within the 00 days but just as well i didn_'_t take time off for the oil man to come !
2	will i use boiler_juice again ?
2	... probably but if this happens too often ill be ringing around ....
2	ashley provides a first_class service - helpful and proactive .
2	the quality of the work we have had done has_been excellent and the value is just unbeatable .
2	i ' d have no_hesitation in recommending printing . com to anyone .
2	good workers friendly & helpful , let_me know how things were going .
2	but the down_side was the first guy that was sent out with just a plunger couldn_'_t unblock the toilet , the second guy sent out the same day with a jetting machine couldn_'_t unblock it ( but he had a remote_control ) the next_day sent billy who was the best but was limited as the equipment that he had wasn_'_t as good as the second guy & had to jet from the drain to the toilet .
2	this caused the toilet to overflow as he couldn_'_t see what was going on ............. if he had a " mate " with him or a remote_control it would have avoided this ........ after having to sleep on the settee for 0 nights with the smell , a contractor came around ( rentokil ) too remove & sanitize the floor .
2	another subcontractor had to attend on 0 occasions too address the problem & remove with digging the drain rods in the collapsed pipe .
2	i '_m left now without carpet in the bedroom or en - suite but do have it working !!!!!
2	!
2	it has cost me 0 days from work , but they have paid for the carpet + vinyl covering for the en - suite , so at_least they have been fair , but if there guy '_s had the right equipment we all wouldn_'_t have had this drama .
2	have used this company on a few occasions now & each time i receive the best advise , quality product '_s & the next_day delivery .
2	what more can you ask for ........
2	a great site that helps cut the costs of over prices vets
2	excellent products at very good prices .
2	prompt and friendly service
2	clear website with good suggestions .
2	accurate clear measurments to give confidence that it would all fit .
2	every year , for the past eleven years , i have paid my water bill over a few_months .
2	every year united utilities have sent me dozens of threatening_letters and made dozens of threatening phone_calls .
2	i have written to them and phoned them , but i get nowhere .
2	this year will be no different .
2	why can they not communicate ?
2	why have they no email address ?
2	why do they waste so much money ?
2	for the price , it was fine .
2	the in - flight staff were extremely pleasant and more than helpful .
2	i would fly with this outfit again .
2	absolutely no_problems at all .
2	i asked watchfinder to repair a vintage movado watch which i had inherited from my father .
2	the crystal had come off , the hands were missing and it needed a service and some_tlc .
2	i have just got the watch back , looking like new , with appropriate new hands and working_perfectly .
2	i would like to thanks brittney gale for seeing the whole project through and can thoroughly_recommend the service provided - absolutely_faultless from_start to finish .
2	they emailed me to tell me the watch was on its way back to me and the watch was carefully_packaged and protected .
2	i cannot recommend this company too highly
2	approx on year_ago i purchased an oki_printer from printerland it arrived in northern_ireland in 0 days .

2	00 / 00
2	having the facility to leave delivery instructions was great - my vw bits arrived within 0 days , left in a secure place as requested .
2	well_done jk and interlink_express .
2	great company to do_business with .
2	effortless .
2	goods were delivered promptly as promised .
2	a great service and better still great prices .
2	as always , the service from e_- buyer is first_class .
2	easy searching , simple purchase process and you can collect nectar_points .
2	“ couldn_'_t ask for a better service and product .
2	everything about the process of customer service , ordering and delivery were excellent .
2	the protection and packaging on the furniture is just right and the quality of the furniture is brilliant .
2	i will be shopping for more furniture soon and will_definitely be using oak_furniture_land again .”
2	i was recommended this company by a friend who was trying to get tyres for his ural outfit .
2	thought i would give openeo a try and was very glad that i did .
2	brilliant price and wonderful service .
2	will quite happily_recommend them to my friends and buy from them again .
2	i used upad for the first time last_week .
2	the website is easy to use and i can describe my house myself and easily add good quality photos .
2	it is also possible to amend the details at any time .
2	also there are several service options that are clearly priced and one can select those that you require .
2	i particularly like the quick updates by email and text_message advising me of those who have expressed interest in my property .
2	i have discovered that i like direct contact and showing them over my house and i get instant feedback from them .
2	i did email one query to upad and they called me back in two minutes and explained everything .
2	it puts buyers and sellers in direct contact and cuts out the time lag .
2	my house is now gone , quicker_than ever before .
2	definitely use upad again .
2	we bought a camera from pixmania .
2	we sent it for repair just out of warranty .
2	this took five months , not helped by emails in ' franglais '.
2	the ' safe and secure ' payment website is a nightmare and kept saying payment failed .
2	we tried 0 times and gave up only to find later they had processed the payment of £_000 three_times but can only get one refunded !
2	so a repair of a screen ( which retails at £_00 by the way ) has cost us £_000 .
2	be warned - avoid extreme frustration and expense - do not deal with this company .
2	sorry pixmania but the world has to know how you treat some of your customers .
2	i was a bit_sceptical at first when i saw those products at those prices but my sceptisism was totally dispelled when the goods turned_up .
2	bit_slow at start but item eventually arrived ok
2	thank_you very much , you saved our_lives after the dog chewed up our last roll of wallpaper , we tried to get it from everywhere until i found you on the e_- bay , it is very awkward when the room is nearly finished apart_from 0 pieces , thank_you again for me not having to do 0 walls again , yours ian fleck
2	very fast service , excellent
2	overall the service was very good although i could not complete the order via smartphone or ipad , but had no problem via laptop .
2	i managed to get a 00_%_discount on the item thanks to a special_offer on top of an existing £ 0 discount .
2	order confirmed and nice_touch to get a txt reminder with expected delivery times apart
2	can not praise pretavoir enough , i received my glasses ( with coatings and reactolite lenses ) in a week and at an excellent price !
2	ps thanks for the oakley cap too :)

2	excellent company to deal with . able to get good advice prior to ordering . very quick delivery . super value for extra high_spec . laptop . to be recommended .
2	one of the joys of on - line shopping is when the goods you have ordered arrive well - packed , clean and exactly_what you '_ve seen on - screen !
2	fragrance_direct never_let_me down by always delivering on time and also delivering a great customer service if i have the occasional need to contact them by telephone .
2	does as it says !
2	first choice for me next time - cheaper_than competitors , very helpful pharmacist advice was available by phone , next_day delivery at no extra_cost via first_class post .
2	efficient order and despatch_notification process .
2	excellent service .
2	i had a temporary bandwith demand which threatened to exceed my limit .
2	i was given an additional allocation for a month free of charge .
2	well impressed .
2	good price , good product , fast delivery .
2	excellent all_round .
2	had never_heard of this company before but needed two new tyres for my old girl so did some shopping around and these_guys came up with a great price , better_than etyres !
2	once i had ordered and booked the time_slot for them to come and fit the tyres at home , they called twice to confirm details and even upgraded the tyres due to lack of stock of my original choice .
2	fitter called me early morning to confirm the time he would be here and arrived exactly as he said he would .
2	nice new equipment and a professional job_done in no time .
2	excellent all the way and will_definitely use them again .
2	easy ordering_process and advised delivery schedule in advance which was spot on .
2	great choice of products which went down really well after a long day in the studio rehearsing for the next gig .
2	will_definitely use again .
2	neff microwave not in stock so ao called and offered bosch for same price - delivered a couple of days_later at alloted_time by friendly driver .
2	best price , good service - would use ao . com again
2	virgin_media helpline - spent 00_minutes with operator who was unable to help and so transferred me to customer service , then 00_minutes on hold before being told that customer service had closed at 0 .
2	on hold again .
2	phone has now run out of batteries .
2	vm used to be ok with their helpdesk - not any more !
2	delivery was delayed through no fault of mytub but i was kept very well informed_throughout .
2	very easy to get in touch with .
2	ordered an item on the 00rd_jan , on a three day delivery , told it was instock , did a track on this item on 00th_jan only to find that the delivery date was now up to the 00 feb . no email from littlewoods informing_me of this delay or why .
2	when i phoned up to find out what was going on i was told by a uphelpfull disinterested customer service person " thats how it is " more or less take it or leave it .
2	if its out of stock or low stock when you order it tell us don_'_t leave us expecting delivery when it its not going to turn_up when you expected it .
2	totally dusgusted with the service .
2	i '_ve gone elsewere and got a guaranteed delivery for wednesday 00th_jan .
2	the service we received from our advisor ian was first_class and in my opinion unbiased .
2	he took the trouble to get to know us , our circumstances , our needs and the plans that we had for the future .
2	on that information he recommended that a equity_release life time mortgage was the right path for us to go down .
2	he never made us feel that we were under any pressure as this was a big decision for us .
2	i had done my homework on other equity_release companies but at the end of the day i know that i have made the right decision by putting my trust in key .
2	this is probably the quickest and easiest_way to purchase btc in the uk .
2	slight premium to pay but worth it just for the ease of transaction and peace of mind .
2	good quality cards , straightforward process , quick_turnaround .
2	very professional .
2	amazon is the best place to shop
2	my item arrived on time excellent value
2	i never pass a fenwicks store .
2	great department stores with fabulous foodhalls in those i have visited .
2	the only reason bt still_exists is i suspect based on it monopoly roots .
2	the services are relatively expensive and not as customer friendly as they would have you believe .
2	not my first choice but value for money is not bad at all .
2	the stores can be dated and tired looking .
2	i have used trainline for so long and would never consider_using anywhere_else .
2	exceptionally good competetive_prices .
2	i love looking around poundland but sometimes wonder about the sources of their merchandice .
2	the policy of the company towards its customers is and still remains legendry .
2	their products outside the foodhalls are however mainly from china and that part of the world .
2	not even my pants are now made in the uk .
2	for a flagship british company this is very dissappointing
2	if there is a gutter in communication , facebook is right there .
2	for absolute tosh & brain dead excremental communication this is the place to go in 00_% of cases .
2	the cards are brilliant and offer so much individuality .
2	for that special_occasion i would not consider anything_else
2	paypal for many_years i have used in_conjunction with ebay but now use for far more .
2	disputes are settled quickly & easily
2	any information i need , then google_search_engine has rarely let_me down .
2	the help facilities are excellent but most_importantly so easy to use .
2	i have bought & sold so many items on ebay over the last 00 + years that it is hard to know where to start .
2	ebays policing is excellent with scammers usually dealt_with straight_away and refunds arranged without a hitch .
2	effortlesly
2	when searching on google , amazon is nearly always the most suitable and competetive .
2	they deliver usually within their own deadlines which is very impressive and i have never been anything other than 000_% delighted .
2	after 00 years with another company o0 have proved to be an excellent alternative .
2	i was offered as fancy or as basic as appropriate and am very pleased so_far after 0 months
2	i was with the company for nearly 00 years .
2	for the first 0 it was good although dealing_with overseas call_centres was a bit of a pain .
2	ii was so pleased that i had several members of my family sign up to talktalk .
2	after then unfortunately it just got worse & worse culminating in a service promise & contract that they even put in writing yet still manage to get wrong and not fix for over 0 months .
2	i lost track of all the staff i spoke to and it was obvious that no one really knew what was going on with nearly everyone promising and rarely delivering .
2	i call it a flamingo syndrome - similar to a cock - up but just a lot bigger
2	indigo thomas jacket arrived very quickly .
2	absolutely love it for the price .
2	looks great , feels great .
2	nice quality touches with pockets , lining and so on .
2	this is my second jacket from brooke taverner , and will not be the last .
2	recommended
2	been using whiskey_exchange fr a couple of years_now , and never had any_problems_whatsoever .

2	great shop !
2	very competive price on dirty_dog shades .
2	in stock and hassle_free checkout .
2	very speedy delivery .
2	definitely recommended .
2	pre ordered an audiolab item , and was delighted to get a call immediately the shipment arrived in uk .
2	everything dealt_with over phone there and then , on a public_holiday , by their excellent customer service team , and item dispatched next working day .
2	arrived within 0 days in perfect_condition .
2	extremely pleased with everything and wouldn_'_t hestiate to use audioaffair again for hifi stuff .
2	placed an order for a tissot gents_watch , which was £_00 cheaper_than anywhere_else on the web , on friday_morning .
2	arrived sat morning at no extra delivery cost .
2	i asked for the bracelet to be adjusted , which was also done at no extra_cost and was spot on .
2	box , paperwork , and watch all brand_new and perfect_condition .
2	extremely pleased with watch and the 0st_class service .
2	i bought these mics from reidys music shop and wow they are just the job ,, i have a lot of trust with these_guys and this is why i plan on shopping with these for good .. ive bought a gretsch country gent ,, tascam 0000 neo track recorder , and now these mics .. all from reidys music .... and they are always there to give you an hand with anything you want to know .. thankyou guys
2	bought the slint box set off them .
2	wasn_'_t sure it would turn_up as i figured it would sell out , but it did , quickly and well_packaged .
2	good job folks
2	a first_class company to deal with .
2	service is quick and delivery is next_day would most definitly recommend my friends to deal with mpb
2	thanks very much brian howes
2	graham has provided a series of services which are very helpful when contemplating this expensive purchase .
2	i have not bought a piano yet but would think that he is interested in finding the right piano for you rather_than the most expensive / best margin .
2	great price , followed_by a call to arrange as visit at a time best for all .
2	it '_s a premium service at a budget price .
2	won_'_t hesitate to use them again .
2	after a confirmed and paid for order , they called 0 days_later to tell me the item had been damaged and they had no other stock .
2	they lied and told me they had tried to contact me the day i placed the order .
2	when i tried to complain , they lied again and the person i spoke to claimed he was the sole director of the company and he was the only one i could complain to .
2	after checking , it turns_out this person is not one of the directors of the company .
2	it is a criminal offence to impersonate the director of a company .
2	basically , they sell items they don_'_t actually have , and the lie to the customer before trying to up - sell another item or process a refund .
2	would wholeheartedly_recommend .
2	takes the sting out of pet_medication .
2	good efficient service , easy ti use no stress
2	say what they do and do what they say .
2	good experience
2	easy to use web_site and 00 hour access with all the possible options you could need .
2	excellent service will be used again
2	many_times i have used this web_site and even when i am unsure the speed of contact and quakity iof advise has_been first_class .
2	i would highly_recommend the goods and the staff for a secure reliable service
2	took only 0 days to arrive , in first_class condition and packed in military style .
2	price some 00_% less_than anywhere_else .
2	look no further for your photographic needs
2	order delivered next_day , product as expected .
2	very good sevice and i would recommend .
2	needed specific product - chair raiser .
2	oneclickpharmacy had the best price online .
2	although it was not available for immediate delivery - had to come from supplier - i was kept up to date with progress_throughout and product arrived after 0 days as promised .
2	great service and price .
2	ordered filing_cabinet that is described as 00 day delivery ( as non standard colour ) 00th_september , preferred delivery any thursday / friday notified at time of purchase .
2	i was contacted to advise longer lead time and delivery early november .
2	during a six week period from 00th_september to date this has not changed and has_been advertised online by ofo and still is as 00 days .
2	i was willing to wait as not urgent .
2	contacted ofo after 0_weeks , 0th_november .
2	advised in email should be delivered w_/ c 00th manufacturer will contact you to agree delivery date .
2	manufacturer not retailer who i have contract with .
2	we will deliver monday 00th_november , i advised as the customer sorry this is not possible no one available monday .
2	now dictated to , take delivery on monday 00th as we are in the area or cancel order and pay 00_% cancellation_fee .
2	i would suggest ambiguity and unreasonable behaviour by supplier ( s ), i do not have a contract with manufacturer but retailer .
2	i '_ll let you guys think about whether this is the sort of company you want to do_business with , i know i '_m going viral with business contacts , friends and family educating them to the service i am being subjected to .
2	i had decided on a cartier ronde solo several months_ago and was delighted to see a brand_new one with watchfinder at a very good price .
2	i was able to get all the information i needed , negotiated an even better price on the phone and it was delivered promptly .
2	on arrival it fulfilled my high expectations .
2	i bought the blind form the excellent website and this was duely delivered reasonably promptly a week or so later .
2	the fabric is very good quality , the problem is the mechanism .
2	the drawstring pull pulls from the " wrong side " of the blind and this makes it somewhat difficult to use !
2	this is a design fault and shlould be brought to the front of the blind .
2	secondly the double hook is too small for winding the drawstring onto and should be higher quality for the price - brass or stainless_steel .
2	i would look around for a better designed product next time , hence i can '_t recommend this company .
2	contacted the telephone sales line to answer a few queries i had regarding speaker_cables - given sound and practical_advice from the helpful advisor .
2	hi -_fi unit and speakers arrived as promised .
2	excellent service at a great price , although i made the purchase via the telephone i found the website easy and very professional .
2	highly_recommend this company .
2	great service , price and lovely tax_disk holder .
2	very impressed , i would highly_recommend .
2	i wouldn_'_t usually take the time out to write a review but the service and glasses i got from this company was outstanding .
2	even my local_opticians didn_'_t look after me this well .
2	i opted for a home visit as i live local and lady was polite and professional when taking my measurements .
2	had the glasses delivered to me within a week .
2	makita li - ion cordless_drill / driver set .
2	professional quality .
2	ordered by telephone in the afternoon and it arrived the next_day .
2	very pleased , best price i could_find & very quick delivery .
2	it is always nice to find a company that you can contact by telephone , especially a normal ( rate ) number .
2	they have confidence in their service to advertise the telephone contact and not hide_behind e_- mail contact only .
2	i try to avoid company '_s that do not advertise a telephone_number .
2	they were very helpful on the telephone , called back when promised and e_- mailed me a quote quickly .
2	i called back to place the order for two small pieces of hardware .
2	these arrived within 00_hours of ordering - i . e .
2	am next_day .
2	overall excellent service & prices .
2	if i have one small grumble it is the cost of delivery - £ 0 +_vat = £ 0 . 00 for two small lightweight products .
2	that said they arrived as two_separate_packages , by secure delivery , am next_day .
2	perhaps it may be worth considering alternative delivery options ?
2	have been waiting a month for my glasses although they tell you that they are dispatched within 0 to 00 days .
2	have sent several emails and they do not have the decency to reply .
2	not impressed at all , absolutely unacceptable and very bad customer service overall .
2	very cheap prices ... delivery on time , what more can you ask !
2	!
2	what more can you ask ... xbox_live_gold_membership at a fantastic price and arrives almost_instantly .
2	i would highly_recommend simplycdkeys !!
2	!
2	great customer service ..
2	ordered a set of 0 led rock lights for my partners pond early on a friday_morning but was desperate for them asap ( he '_s short in the patience department ).. with a small surcharge for a saturday delivery they arrived on my doorstep less_than 00_hours_later .. my partner was so happy with the quality of the product he has now ordered another 0 sets !!!!
2	thanks uk water_features ; o )
2	cheapest price on the net , no problem to change order at last_minute , fast delivery - well impressed ...!
2	had a problem with ordering wrong type lights jay laverick corrected the order with no_fuss and dispatched overnight outstanding service
2	cannot_praise fastlec co and staff enought
2	i recommend acer direct to any potential customer , this a customer friendly company who are only too glad to assist in any_problems you may incur
2	always use photobox - photos come very fast and quality is bang on
2	yes - you can trust this firm - good delivery - quick and item perfect on arrival
2	purchased floor_standing mixer tape for bathroom .
2	really good and not hard to fit .
2	all the flexy pipes included ....
2	nice square chrome design with really good switchover valve for shower_head - not the usual push pull clunky knob - this is a smooth
2	half turn valve tap .
2	good !
2	!
2	grrrreat service - they told me when it would arrive within a 0 hour_window - and it did .
2	perfect martin factory_fresh .

2	i '_ve recycled a few phones with mazuma now .
2	each time i fill in the on line sell form , the return envelope is on my doormat the day after .
2	payment for the latest phone i sent them was in my account within_00hrs of me sending it off .
2	i '_ve read loads of poor reviews about other mobile_phone_recyclers and i can_honestly_say that : a . mazuma have never questioned their original valuation on the phone and b .
2	they '_ve always paid in a timely_manner , whether it '_s by cheque of direct bank_transfer .
2	top_marks mazuma !
2	the only thing ' supa ' about this company is the speed at which they took my money .
2	i have been defrauded out of £_00 . 00 !
2	they have refused to send the 0 perfumes that i ordered , stating that they are awaiting dispatch , ( they '_ve been waiting dispatch since 0th_december ) and will not refund the money after three_times of asking .
2	if anyone is interested in joining me in contacting watchdog about this second - rate , shoddy outfit , please do so .
2	don_'_t let them get away with this appauling level of ' service '.
2	under no circumstances should you part with your hard_earned_cash with supaperfumes .
2	update_: the day after this feedback was left at trustpilot , supapefume gave_me a full_refund .
2	this just goes to prove that if you complain loudly enough and publicly enough , your voice will be heard .
2	thank_you trustpilot for the forum .
2	other dissatisfied_customers please take_note .
2	point 0 - users who provide a 0_star good review actually results in your overall score being downgraded .
2	matirx should be 0_stars neutral , 0_stars increases your score and 0 , 0 , 0 downgrades .
2	most users expect a decent business to provide a fast service .
2	the days of next_day delivery after despatch being a " wow " factor is over .
2	all decent retailers can do this now and it is now expected .
2	so to get a 0_star_review based on user getting an item super quick is harder as we , as good retailers do this in our sleep .
2	trustpilot should accept this and in some ways take some accolades for it , as they have helped true retailers raise the game but to punish the retailer with a reduction in score for being good is stupid .
2	point 0 - no understanding of business
2	trustpilot uses a system to allow retailers to request a review guideline and in the interim period not show the review .
2	this is flawed beyond_belief .
2	a .)
2	if the review has the slightest mention of a service complaint , the review stands , even if it is illegal or just wrong .
2	we have exmaples , albeit few , of low reviews for products we do not or have ever sold ..
2	how does this end up on trustpilot ?
2	in our case we did supply the reviewer with goods , but the user obvoulsy ordered something else from elsewhere and got mixed up .
2	no problem we thought ., we submitted the review for evaluation and explained that we do not sell that product and suggested the above scenario .
2	they came straight back and said the user provided an order number and the review stands .
2	well he would have had one from us , and one form the other supplier .
2	but there is no common_sense in trustpilot .
2	there lack of business understanding means they cannot get their heads around what can sometimes happen in business .
2	although the camera was out of stock it was sourced and delivered quickly .
2	excellent communications and speedy delivery would have no_hesitation in recommending this company .
2	what a joy to have good old_fashioned service with a smile from a delivery driver who was friendly and efficient .
2	nice to see someone_who took pride in his job .
2	many_thanks
2	parcel was picked_up by polite and helpful driver , i had no_worries_about the safe delivery of the item as i was assured by the professional attitude of the collecting agent that it would arrive at it '_s destination without_any problem , and so it proved .
2	very pleased with the service which i will recommend to friends and use again .
2	thanks
2	would use these guy '_s again !
2	would buy these blinds again as arrived in 00_hours . didn_'_t sign for them though as courier placed them over side_gate which was locked but they could of been accessed from passers_by . thoroughly pleased with them though !
2	no matter what i need justgolfonline have always got it .
2	the prices are spot on and my order is always delivered on time , or better .
2	can '_t go_wrong
2	i wanted to start cycling again after not having done so for a few_years_now , and came to tredz on a online search .
2	i found the website very imformative as bikes have moved on freatly since i stopped riding .
2	online_chat was so helpfull in choosing the right bike and size for me .
2	the knowledge_base of the staff is second to noneand i am overjoyed with my bike so much so that i am going to do a charity bike_ride in june . i would really recommend tredz for any purchase and help in any matter to do with bikes and equipment from shoes to lights .
2	we have used_etyres now for a couple of years , and will not go_anywhere_else for tyres . great choice of tyres , the best prices always prompt and on time no_complaints at all .
2	would and have recommended to lots of friends and family .
2	i was a little_sceptical as others have reviewed , but no need to be . i was drawn to the currency_club through a money search_engine , and many good reviews . the best rate that i could_find on the day and other days , better_than my bank and local eurochange . ordered on saturday lunchtime and received euros on tuesday_lunchtime .
2	all correct and a mixture of notes as requested all new notes as well . did transaction through bacs system which is easy to arrange through online_banking . i will_definately_use currency_club again , and will recommend to all who ask me .
2	you can find lots of interesting thing at lightinthebox and very cheep
2	i cannot_praise too highly the professionalism , expertise and courtesy shown by travel_nation ( thank_you alarna ).
2	outstanding customer service .
2	have bought several_times from charterhouse and always found the prices to be very competitive .
2	fast delivery as well .
2	as a first - time buyer , i found the prices to be good , the delivery excellent and general buying experience to be good .
2	this has_been my first experience of pet_supermarket and it has_been good .
2	i will use them again .
2	i would not have bought from datakits if i had seen all the bad_reviews beforehand , but my experience was not bad .
2	i bought a mobile case and received a case the next_day ( very good ).
2	however , the case was not the case advertised being a cheaper alternative ( not good ).
2	i emailed the sales_department and received a prompt reply ( to my relief ).
2	after a couple of more emails , both of which received prompt_replies i decided to accept the product sent me and datakits ' offer of a partial_refund , which was in line with the price i could have got it elsewhere .
2	there was a bit of a delay in receiving the refund but after a reminder from me i received the refund via_paypal .
2	the plus point is that i have an acceptable mobile case at an acceptable price .
2	the negative_point is that datakits were descrbing a product they didn_'_t have .
2	but at_least they did resolve the problem promptly .
2	i ordered the watch in the run up to christmas having looked_everywhere around locally for it but couldn_'_t find it .
2	i looked on line and this was the cheapest place to buy it .
2	the whole_process took less_than 00_hours from ordering to delivery .
2	friendly helpful driver and fast efficient service , no_problems so_far , big_improvement from parcels0go and no middlemen .
2	discount for multiple order collections which a lot dont do .
2	rebooked with citylink 00 at parcel0go sams ' suggestion after 0 days of failed_collections from yodel .
2	told by sam not to relabel as citylink would do it .
2	bad advice .
2	morons in city_link ( or deliberately malicious ?)
2	put the wrong labels on the two parcels .
2	now 0_weeks_later , one has_been returned to me clearly showing mislabelling by citylink and one appears lost .
2	thanks a bunch parcel0go , 00 years to get 000_% 0000 + feedback and then i suffer this incompetence .
2	hours spent on 0 chats to different operators and to add_insult to injury , my refund has_been rejected ??
2	parecl0go need to up their game as opposition is now better .
2	now using ipost and cut out these middlemen with numerous failed_collections .
2	i found this site very easy to use and the descriptions told me all i needed to know .
2	the delivery was quick and the returns sysytem if you should need to use it was first_class and so easy .
2	i was really pleaased with the service from outdoor_world .
2	my order arrived even more quickly than they said it would and for no extra_charge .
2	i will use them again
2	i saw the shirts in france but was not able to buy them at that time , so i was very pleased to find them on the web_site .
2	i ordered and they arrived with in a couple of days .
2	they are exactly as_described and i am very pleased with them .
2	i ordered a park chain checker form merlin_cycles because they offerred the best value and included free delivery .
2	the process was very easy and the goods arrived quickly .
2	i bought 0 pcs together which was very fortunate because it enabled_me to compare them before turning anything on .
2	there were fundamental errors in the build of both of them .
2	0 .
2	usb plugged_into ieee port on the motherboard which would if used have caused damage to the motherboard .
2	0 .
2	mini speaker and usb 0 card not fitted to one motherboard just left in the packaging .
2	0 .
2	one pc had a plastic_bag of screws loose_inside the box .
2	if that had been left in there and the plastic had melted the metal screws would have fallen all over the internal components and shorted various items out .
2	items 0 to 0 have now been resolved by the company .
2	i have submitted photos to pc_specialist to back up these points and i am told they are being referred to the build manager .
2	the upload photo feature is not working otherwise i would have included them .
2	0 .
2	one pc has_been cloned incorrectly such that it thinks that all data should be assigned to the d drive but that is the one assigned to the optical_drive .
2	we have suibmmitted a request for advice on this issue and are still in talks to resolve it .
2	packaging , despatch and delivery service all of a high_standard .
2	i contacted parcel0go as i have a parcel to go to spain but know there is a surcharge for a " remote " destination .
2	i spoke to emma today and she provided me with all the details to enable me to book the parcel in later in the month for collection .
2	she was very helpful and gave_me the information quickly .
2	unlike jon at the weekend who made me feel like giving up the will to continue living , as he was unable to provide the information i received quickly from emma .
2	so glad i decided to give parcel0go another call on live_chat this morning ..
2	thanks emma and due to her help i shall be using parcel0go and not another company .
2	concept blinds made to measure facility means that we were able to order exactly the size that we wanted in our chosen wooden_venetian_blind - there is an excellent selection to choose from .
2	it was easy to fit so even my husband could do it .
2	the price was also excellent .
2	the blind arrived quickly and best of all it looks great !
2	we had a small problem in that the mechanism locked but a quick phone_call to the customer_services team soon gave_me the answer and advice required to release it .
2	all in all we could not be more satisfied .
2	this is the first venetian_blind that we have gone for and if we decide on any more we will_definitely be choosing concept blinds to purchase through .
2	i thoroughly_recommend concept blinds to anyone reading this review because you will get good service , quality goods at a very reasonable price .
2	this is the first time i have ordered from printer_basics and i am so glad that i decided to try them out .
2	the ordering_process was quick , easy and painless .
2	delivery was very fast and the cartridges themselves are of an excellent quality .
2	so_far i am very impressed and will be using printer_basics again .
2	i managed to insure a smart phone and iphone 0 and two tablets for much less_than the individual costs of insurance .
2	cover appears to be the same as that offered by other_companies .
2	the form was easy to complete .
2	all in all a very good experience i would recommend to anyone .
2	well_done protect my bubble !!
2	!
2	tesco lakeside is filthy and i often shop late at night to see and smell 0 or 0 members of staff smoking in the doorway at 0am
2	i had an honest review on scs sofas removed for adding " avoid these_crooks " at the end which is neither offensive or obscene trustpilot seems to kow tow to the companies being reviewed !
2	british_gas just replaced my boiler and provided an excellent service from ordering to installation , the fitters even replaced my old thermostat without charge just because i said it looks old .
2	can '_t praise them enough .
2	they have admitted to seining out fake solicitors letters and charged their customers for them .
2	shame on wonga !
2	£ 0000 reclining sofa delivered with a damaged motor .
2	was told someone would be in touch but nobody contacted me and i had to call their 0000 phone number after 0_weeks of silence to be told nobody would even come out to look at sofa for 0_weeks .
2	and a month later i '_m still_waiting for scs to respond with an offer of a replacement .
2	the food actually tastes good which is a first for diet meals which normally taste awful .
2	i '_m also pleased with the weight_loss .
2	highly_recommended .
2	we booked early and got a really good price - we booked two rentals , one for six_weeks and another for seven .
2	i got the dates wrong ( i forgot to tell them when the flights changed ) - but they didn_'_t charge when we turned_up two_days late .
2	we had to return to the uk to visit a sick relative ; they refunded us the week we didn_'_t use a car , but honoured the good longer_term rates we were originally_quoted .
2	so , we had three cars , all recent - one only had 0000_km on the clock .
2	no_problems with them at all .
2	return procedure is simple - they give you an envelope when you collect the car , just write in date & time , odometer reading , fuel level ( half full out & in ), and the bay you left in in .
2	drop the envelope off at the desk .
2	insurance is total - little parking dinks are common on the island , so no_worries .
2	in the last few_months we have used fastrac and airporter - several_times .
2	services are great , but both my wife and a friend did three circuits of the airport before finding the airporter car_park .
2	why ?
2	because the signs run out and you have to guess that you have to follow " authorised vehicles only ".
2	takes the gloss off somewhat .
2	when i was young i used to spend my pocket money in an amazing shop called jarrolds in the middle of cambridge .
2	it sold paper - pads and pads of it in all sizes , plain , lined and most deliciously squared .
2	upstairs were more specialist departments where i bet dons could get quills sharpened .
2	this company is the 0000 '_s web equivalent .
2	people who love stationery , who find the fun in functional , they communicate brilliantly .
2	they also stock the stuff i use , and have a website and newsletter that leads to new discoveries and so many temptations .
2	do i need a new lamy biro , some turquoise ink , beautiful scandinavian dotted paper - i so do !
2	oh - and the service is great too .
2	sometimes you win - i '_ve no_problems with yodel , i live on the edge of civilisation in scotland and have to have to lot of stuff delivered .
2	they know us and stuff turns_up ok . pixmania are conservative in their delivery promises and usually beat their date .
2	i bought a netgear wireless range extender .
2	the reviews warned that it comes with a continental_plug and converter - it did , a bit oversized , but it '_s easy to cut the plug off and fit a uk one .
2	the reviews also warned the instructions for set_up were in french - they were .
2	the reviews also said they were rubbish even in english , and some helpful person explained how to do it .
2	i wish i ' d printed that off , because in the 0 or 0 days it took to arrive ( i was out first time ) the whole entry - product and reviews - had disappeared from the pixmania website ( or at_least i couldn_'_t find it - nor could the history entries in my browser ).
2	i spent an unhappy hour strugging to find another source of help on the internet .
2	pixmania overall - sometimes they ' re cheaper_than other_sites , but all the extras they try and add in automatically mean i avoid them otherwise .
2	recently had a hard_disk failure and lost all my emails including tracking_details for a parcel sent to the states .
2	spoke to catherine_corless who provided me with the information and delivery update in under 0 minutes .
2	excellent service .
2	i was drawn to an email which gave_me a link to a short video on the pocket boom , a cool gadget which turns a flat surface into a speaker .
2	the price was so good that i bough two .
2	the site was easy to navigate , and i was really surprised that the package arrived two_days_later .
2	i tested the product and it works just as the video said it would .
2	i '_ve been using ccl for many_years , at_least 00 .
2	their pre_- sales and after sales service is impeccable .
2	they deliver when they say they will and should i need to return an item ( only once in 00yrs and that was my fault ) there is no third degree questioning .
2	if i '_m not quite sure what component i need i just send a breif e_- mail to their tech_support and they reply with a link that takes me straight to what i want .
2	i once ordered an item for my sons_birthday , i placed the order on - line at 0 . 00pm on a friday .
2	it arrived at 00 . 00am the next_day .
2	you cant_knock that !
2	take my advice , get ccl on your favourites_list and make_sure its your first_port of call for all your tech requirements , plus you will most_likely save a lot of money on the top name brands as well .
2	ccl ?
2	in one word ......... faultless !!!!!
2	!
2	a great bean_bag the whole family love it !
2	it wont be long before i buy more !
2	it '_s a fight now to see who gets to sit there !
2	super_fast delivery !
2	buy with confidence !
2	very fast service and good products
2	bought an inno cycle_carrier and a thule_roof_box both products are excellent and delivery was very quick had to phone customer service before buying for advise they were very helpfull in dealing_with my enquiry excellent
2	transferwise . com and currencyfair . com are the only peer to peer money transfer companies i know of .
2	all good .
2	could hardly be better .
2	i haven_'_t compared exactly the same deal on both to see if there is a difference in value but guess it would be very small if so .
2	one difference is that any few_pounds of change from a transferwise deal goes back to my own bank_account by default .
2	last time i used currencyfair , the £ 0 or so stayed in my account with them by default , to use next time or transfer back to me .
2	( auctionchex . com is something similar too and perfectly good , based in the needs of people who are offered cheque payment in another currency .
2	their strength is in reducing the minimum charge for paying - in an overseas currency cheque , for example from an ebay sale .
2	i don_'_t know whether they compete the kinds of transfers transferwise do , and their diy web_site is a bit like my diy website rather_than something slick .)
2	back to the subject of transferwise : i recommend them .
2	they made a big deal about their "£ 00 for our 00 - week plan " offer .
2	only after accepting it did i realise the £_00 only covered the first four weeks , and the remaining eight_weeks would cost an additional £_000 !
2	i cancelled as soon as i had the first four week '_s worth .
2	so_far , it all tastes nice enough , and i feel that i got my money '_s worth , but there '_s no way that three_times as much would be worth £_000 .
2	at_least there was no problem cancelling once i ' d discovered the real pricing .
2	i bought the cheapest 0 - pin mains shaver adapter that showed up on " google_shopping " and it just happened to come from kenable .
2	it arrived the next_day .
2	you can '_t say_fairer_than that !
2	the glasses are top - quality , and the most comfortable pair i '_ve ever_owned .
2	i sometimes forget i '_m wearing them .
2	delivery was a little_slow ( nearly 0_weeks ) but for the price that '_s an acceptable compromise .
2	the glasses cost me £ 0 plus £ 0 postage , and came with anti - reflective , anti - scratch_coatings .
2	those cost £_00 on their own at specsavers , so it '_s like getting the glasses for free !
2	recommended .
2	i needed to book a ticket urgently due to a family emergency .
2	i spoke to bruce and in just 00_hours was on a flight to see them .
2	bruce sorted the international flights with no_fuss and at the right price .
2	i also needed to get an internal flight on a domestic airline .
2	i mentioned to bruce that i needed to do that .
2	he told me that dialaflight couldn_'_t deal with that particular carrier but he still looked up the flights for me .
2	he told me the price of the tickets in the local currency and explained how i could book it online so that i could get a connecting_flight with the one he sorted for me .
2	fantastic customer service .
2	i run a small company with irregular overseas shipments .
2	by using transglobal i am able to ship taking_advantage of very competitive freight rates which i wouldn_'_t be able to get by contacting couriers direct .
2	on the rare_occasions that i need to contact transglobal by phone the staff are extremely_helpful and efficient .
2	why would anyone want to use any other freight broker !
2	?

2	probably the worst online company i '_ve ever_dealt_with .
2	they don_'_t have the courtesy to inform you if they can '_t fulfill an order .
2	it '_s virtually_impossible to speak to anyone on the phone and when you ' re asked to leave a message on their answerphone you can '_t because it '_s not working .
2	finally , they have an inability to send you invoices and credit notes which they may one day live to regret if they are ever inspected by hmrc vat inspectors .
2	what can i add , to my heading , i found the on - line experience extremely easy with griptape !!!
2	as being new to shopping on - line , i found them very helpful indeed , i had a small problem , and called the company on my landline , left a message ' not expecting a reply , gosh !!!
2	was i surprised , yhey called me back almost_immediately with the answer i was looking for . many_thanks .
2	please_pass this on to them , as not everybody wants to go on twitter or face book .
2	communication is paramount , i typed up my query but it would not go , i typed into the message the code requested to be put , a message said wrong code gave another , after 00 attempts i gave up
2	i will have to phone them to get a message to them , which will be a pain .
2	i wanted to ask them if their lynx tail lx000 & their double bearing pitch slider came with the fittings to connect from their tail to the pitch slider & from their pitch slider to my microheli weighted blades , as the photos did show any , nor were any shown on their site , did one have to use the links from the original units ?.
2	this is important to buyers !
2	and too many sites , do not make it clear whether their upgrade parts fit as bought or whether further items have to be bought ?
2	or do originals have to be mated to the upgrades so it will function ?
2	if they fufill this very important information clarity requirement they will be the best of supplier of them all

2	i bought a pair of headphones from hifiheadphones and didn_'_t get on with them .
2	exchanged them for a more_expensive pair based on reviews i ' d read .
2	these also proved an unwise choice .
2	sent them back and was given a full and prompt refund .
2	just had to pay for the postage .
2	very patient and understanding sales_team .
2	i made quite a number of calls to robin and steve .
2	this is what internet_shopping should be about and these_guys set the standard .
2	would definitely recommend .
2	the hifi is very handy in small roomas yiu can keep the speakers to the hifi or detach ythem and spread them out for a better sound .
2	as my daughter only has a small room it is an ideal audio device for her and she_likes the colour purple .

2	i have not sent the snorkel back yet i will have to just write it off and buy i when at site as i do not have the time to wait for them to sand a replace out before my hols
2	picked_up a great value two week holiday from the dealchecker email to mauritius .
2	not only was the price good but we had a free upgrade to all inclusive which believe you me is really worthwhile in mauritius where the prices are definitely on the high side .
2	very pleased !
2	i '_ve had problems in the past with errors by deepblue in filling orders and also with slow delivery by royal_mail second class ( the free option ) but this order arrived the next_day and was spot on .
2	i paid an extra £ 0 . 00 for the ' signed for ' delivery and this is way faster_than ordinary second class post , which can take up to a week .
2	amazon review
2	i have been using amazon for several_years , with out any type of issue .
2	apart_from being one of the cheapest suppliers of electrical goods , they are also very efficient .
2	a top brand , with top prices and out of this world customer service .
2	ordered three items from simply baby last_week , the website was very easy to use , and the delivery speed was the quickest yet .
2	the price , quality and super_fast delivery make them by far one of the finest online suppliers i have ever used .
2	i thought itunes were quick ,
2	thank_you for such a professional service , which is very much_appreciated

2	i haven_'_t been off it since i purchased it last month , i '_ve been so impressed with it !
2	never been
2	so happy with a product in ages .
2	as a photography student this has really helped_me achieve the grades i need , a software has never helped_me so much with anything !

2	thank_you serif !
2	being an engineer having a good website for use regarding my field is always very advantageous and this brilliant website offers you exactly_what you need
2	in way of company information and general needs .
2	the website is incredibly easy to use and has many sections to choose from to learn about the company such as markets , projects , services , suppliers and of course careers .
2	there is also extensive information available on a wide_variety of additional subjects which only adds to the overall performance of the website .
2	i have no trouble recommending this website to all of you and i hope that you will find the website as
2	helpful as i have .
2	been using liberty for 0 years_now and not had a cig since , to me its the best thing since_sliced_bread .
2	they have excellent products and always deliver on time and get good discounts would recommend anyone to use liberty and there great for diy .
2	pleasure to deal with a company who understand and meet their customers ' needs .
2	delivery always on time .
2	well_done .
2	i paid online for the rental to be collected from girona airport , spain .
2	the car turned_out to be provided by aurigacrown , whose office is visible from baggage_collection area .
2	there was a long wait while the guy solved some problem for the people ahead of me , then he dealt_with me fairly quickly .
2	i was offered a smallish car at first , then a peugeot partner , which is more of a commercial van than a car , but was ideal for my needs .
2	the car was supplied with a full_tank of diesel , with no refund for unused .
2	this is standard in spain and i was expecting it .
2	the guy also took a 000_euro_deposit .
2	at the end of the week we had used nearly 0 / 0 tank , returned the vehicle easily , with no damage .
2	my 000_euros were refunded smoothly a week_later .
2	i had taken out my own excess_insurance , and we took our own booster_seats for the three kids , so avoided potential ripoffs by advance planning !
2	next_day delivery at no extra_cost .
2	better_than amazon !
2	i would certainly order from them again , no_complaints whatsoever .
2	thank_you for a great service !
2	my first purchase from this company floundered because i did not complete the ' payment ' form correctly ( fat fingers !)
2	they emailed me to remind me about the incomplete orser and i was able to send it correctly .
2	the goods were despatched very quickly , were as_described , and were significantly_cheaper_than other online suppliers .
2	needed an era multipoint lock gearbox assembly for a client .
2	knew id did it from their catalogue .
2	ordered on sunday_evening , mechanism arrived tuesday am and installed and working by wednesday pm .
2	it could have been quicker , but only if they invent telepathic ordering and teleport the goods !
2	i sent an email to ph on the wednesday_morning , got a reply wednesday_evening , placed an order wednesday_night , got delivery friday_morning , wore to footie on the saturday .
2	great comms and delivery service .
2	will be buying again once the summer collection is out .
2	the man in seat 00 ( seat00 . com ) points to loco0 as the best way to buy tickets for european_train_journeys .
2	he '_s right , i '_m_sure .
2	i needed tickets for paris to toulouse having already bought eurostar tickets for the journey between london and paris ( on different dates ).
2	i found the site much_better designed and easier to use than the eurostar site .
2	i particularly_liked the fact that as well as journey durations there is a little map_showing trains taking alternative routes to toulouse to help decide which train to take .
2	i found the website very informative and the ordering_process easy .
2	prices are extremely competitive and insurance is good .
2	the lens was delivered when i was told it would be and it was easy to return after the hire_period .
2	ordered a gibson_sg 0000 , it arrived within two_days . the packing was very good and the guitar was well_protected .
2	the neck was perfect so i just lowered the string action a little and it was fine , no frett dressing was required .
2	overall the experience was perfect from placing the order to being_able to play the guitar exceeded my expectations .
2	this is the first guitar that i have not had to adjust the truss_rod ( i have six other guitars all brought new ) i don_'_t know whether it was set_up at the factory or whether dawsons set it up but it is certainly a factor that will influence me to use dawsons again .
2	so top_marks awarded to dawsons , well_done !!
2	!
2	i have used dv000 five times now , the first order was placed over the phone and the other orders were done online .
2	next_day delivery and text_message_stating what time the delivery will arrive within a one - hour_window .
2	the items that i ordered were perfect as was the entire experience using dv 000 .
2	epiphone 000 sg was very nice , good action for a cheap guitar & in perfect_condition & well_packed .
2	tracking_number with online tracking .
2	delivery was a day late & the time of day was also late but that was the fault of parcel_force .
2	i will use gear0music again , no_problems .
2	the items arrive the day after i ordered them , much_faster_than_expected
2	everything about theprintspace is top_notch .
2	from the beautifully calibrated downloadable profiles they supply free of charge ... easy to use file uploading and ordering system on their web_site ... and the highly professional and attentive after care service whenever i have a question ... print turnaround is lightning_fast too , and i am always overwhelmed_by the quality of the prints .
2	five_stars every time ;-)
2	hi ordered a new washing line on line from the home_laundry company .
2	it came within a couple of days .
2	well pleased .
2	ordered a new magimix two_days_later it was in our kitchen .
2	how good is that especially as it '_s silly season in full swing .
2	well_done go - electric .
2	looked on the internet and found a . o .
2	prices were good with free_postage and no nasty visa_card charges .
2	unlike another internet firm with a similar name .
2	this made it for me .
2	quality of cooker - hood is good .
2	supplied next_day could not wish for a better service .
2	tried the lamps in our kitchen 0st .
2	result was amazing 0 lamps and we need dark glasses , almost , because it is so bright and our kitchen is white .
2	secondly used 0 in the shower room can now see to shower great >
2	arrived on time in good condition
2	ordered friday and delivered monday .
2	company agreed to change bundle to meet my requirement .
2	only one small drawback concerning somewhat difficult to contact sales staff .
2	otherwise would recommend .
2	recently_bought two kindle packages and accessories plus a panasonic_lumix camera .
2	all items were perfect on delivery and the research done by amazon ensured best value for money .
2	indeed the reviews of cameras was superb .
2	the service for our kindles is also amazing , we both think they ' re great .
2	just golf online ... does
2	what it says on the tin .... fine example of a company that deliver on their promises .... and the delivery is excellent .
2	we ordered a semi - integrated_dishwasher - the ordering_process was good , but the delivery process is another matter entirely .
2	we organised delivery for the saturday of the jubilee bank_holiday .
2	we then had a call from hiway ( the delivery company ) saying the van had broken down and that it would be delivered on sunday instead .
2	i was frustrated at the breakdown , but impressed with the offer of a sunday delivery .
2	come sunday and hiway calls again , " sorry_sir , no delivery today as appliancesdirect didn_'_t actually send us your dishwasher , so it '_s not on the van ."
2	i call and am told that customer service will be in at 0 on monday and can help .
2	i called at 0 and am now told they ' re only there at 00 , does anyone at this company know what '_s happening ?
2	so right now i have four things
2	0 .
2	a hole in my account balance having paid for a dishwasher
2	0 .
2	an appliances direct website that claims said dishwasher is out for delivery
2	0 .
2	a delivery company telling_me that the dishwasher never arrived with them in the first place
2	0 .
2	a wasted four day break
2	grrr
2	i ordered online but had to call to sort a paypal issue - the service was prompt and friendly and i was kept_informed_throughout .
2	ok you pay more but the tickets are the best .
2	i was in row four for the doobie brothers in 0000 and for me it was the best concert experience ever .
2	they are my long time favorite band and so worth every_penny .
2	keep_up the great work double 0
2	quality material , beautiful dress & superb workmanship
2	hi ,
2	these flowers were delivered to an actress friend who says they have really brightened_up her dressing room .
2	the service & communication were first_class & the delivery was nice & early .
2	would definitely use serentaflowers again .
2	fast payment , easy transaction .
2	highly_recommended
2	an ideal way of getting tenants .
2	i get a text as soon as they request a viewing and an email with more detail shortly_afterwards .
2	all i have to do is arrange to meet them at the property and i can leave the rest to openrent .
2	referencing was painless , quick and value for money - and it came with the opportunity to get rgi
2	highly_recommended .
2	surely a model for the future .
2	i will_certainly be back to 0000rpm .
2	we came initially with a defective product hoping for a repair .
2	we spoke at length to a very knowledgable person_who advised us in a simple but certainly not patronising way .
2	we decided to go down the purchase route and again the member of staff took time to explain various products strengths and weaknesses for what we required .
2	when i returned to pick_up the product i eavesdropped on a couple of staff / customer conversations .
2	these must have been among your youngest staff but i found their attention and courtesy superb .
2	0000rpm have a very professional attitude .
2	i love the comment on your invoice . "
2	we are only human ".
2	it would be great if everyone took this attitude .
2	many_thanks .
2	i thought i had a puncture , being short of time i found grippy on line and booked an appointment and paid , all done .
2	i received a phone_call from darren , the guy dealing_with my job , half an_hour before he turned_up to say he was on his way .
2	turned_up spot on time , a personable guy and well kitted_out vehicle , looking good .
2	he checked out my wheel and tyre thoroughly and told me my tyre was fine and no puncture .
2	he put the wheel back on and notified me that there would be no charge , call out or anything and he would notify his office and they would issue a refund of my payment .
2	whilst he was still outside my house , his office phoned to confirm this and off he went .
2	what can i say , brilliant , i will_definately now use this company from now on and please everybody , spread the grippy word , you find a decent company nowadays hang on and don_'_t let go !!
2	!
2	scott at dial - a - flight in croydon was recommended by a colleague .
2	that recommendation could not have come highly_enough - the service i received was alert to my requirements , considerate in ensuring that i got precisely what i wanted , and even saved me some money ( coming in at almost £_000 cheaper_than the equivalent i had hitherto used ).
2	that level of service cannot easily be matched .
2	with the saving on overall cost that i also secured , it is frankly unbeatable !
2	i do not often give credit for telephone_manner ( sadly , it seems to be lacking in many service providers ) but can without_hesitation recommend this concern in that regard too .
2	easy light_weight and powerful .
2	sure you can stall it in the long wet grass but otherwis it will cut through small branches and twigs easily and chomp through the grasses .
2	trimmed the 00 ft grass around the trailer .... no problem .
2	had a difficulty with the order which was sorted_out nicely - recommended
2	great service .
2	quick delivery .
2	recommended .
2	cheaper by a long way than anywhere_else i could_find on the net .
2	very quick delivery - for free .
2	great service , highly_recommended .
2	just want to say , their after sales service is excellent !
2	i know there are a number of good providers of photographic merchandise out there but of those i have used i could not recommend photoworld any higher .
2	i purchased a photobook and first of all found their design options to be easy to use and offering a good range of attractive options .
2	if you are not particularly it literate don_'_t worry , you will find after experimenting a little that you will master it quite easily .
2	ordering was easy and best of all when the finished_article arrive only a few_days after i ordered i was delighted .
2	i have only used this service once and found them to do a high_quality job , to do it quickly and at a price which was good value for money .
2	i have already identifies further work which i will be asking them to do .
2	the order was easy to place , the delivery was very quick and the goods were exactly_what i expected .
2	searched all shops on ebay , followed the link to the rail loft and they had the item in stock ready for dispatch and cheaper_than anyone_else i could_find .
2	items were sent out quickly and well_packed , no_complaints from me .
2	the purchase and transaction were simple .
2	the delivery was quick .
2	the refills were 0st_class .
2	as per the title , i had an almost two year_old phone to sell following the purchase of a new model .
2	i had a look at various comparison_websites and prices ranged from £_00 to £_00 .
2	after looking at the reviews of the top paying websites ( really poor !)
2	i decided to go with fonebank who were offering £_00 or a £_00 amazon_voucher .
2	signed_up , got the postal label , wrapped up well and sent off .
2	with a proof of posting .
2	a couple of days_later had an e_- mail from fonebank saying the phone had been received and i should be getting my voucher from amazon in the next couple of days - and sure_enough i did .
2	simple to do , realistic prices and quick .
2	would use again .
2	ordered a bumper style case for the above phone as i wanted the phone to show through .
2	very good quality case , delivery good .
2	would use again .
2	hi , some mixed_reviews here about handtec so i thought i would add my own .
2	i ordered a garmin 0000 sat_nav on 00 . 00 . 00 in the morning and received the usual e_- mail acknowledgement .
2	in the afternoon i received an e_- mail saying it had been dispatched via_dpd .
2	on 00 . 00 . 00 i checked the delivery status on the dpd website and it was due between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 .
2	it arrived safe and sound at 00 . 00 .
2	so , good service from handtec and dpd .
2	would use again .
2	hi .
2	i '_ve bought from bikers gear twice_now over a period of nine_months .
2	the products that i bought - gloves and kevlar_jeans - are excellent quality and better value than from other mc clothing providers .
2	i '_ve also used their returns_procedure and had good service from them with my e_- mail query quickly responded to and my account being credited promptly .
2	will happily use again .
2	bought a teng torque_wrench .
2	nicely_packaged , quick delivery .
2	would use again .
2	have bought an olympic weight set and heavy gym mats recently .
2	both are excellent products and delivery has_been first_class .
2	it '_s always concerning when buying an expensive item from a company for the first time .
2	however , the website is first_class and allowed_me to personalise the pc to the specification that i wanted and gave useful_information about the components .
2	once ordered , the e_- mail updates work nicely so that you know where your pc is in the production line .
2	you can also have a text sent once the pc is dispatched .
2	it arrived in good packaging and the pc inside as ordered .
2	their website also has a forum that is bang up to date .
2	you can find info here regarding specifications and useful advice .
2	i ’ ve had the pc just over a week now and so_far it ’_s brilliant !
2	without shiply i would find it hard to order goods and services far away and having the ability to obtin quotes from numerous providers with feedback from others helps to make the right choice for each delivery .
2	great idea dn so_far the service has_been excellent
2	just good to have the support when i needed it .
2	an excellent service - well_done and thank_you .
2	it '_s was so easy to book my tickets .
2	the whole_experience was great .
2	i will_def be using skiddle again and recommend them to all my friends
2	i '_ve_used dpd in the past and have had nothing but first_class service .
2	but how wrong can you be huh_?
2	i ordered goods on friday_afternoon expecting it today .
2	i even got an email from my retailer confirming today '_s date .
2	i usually get a text in the morning of delivery from dpd giving me a rough_estimate within the hour of when my delivery was going to arrive .
2	this was the feature that i thought dpd had over the rival courier companies .
2	however entered my tracking_number online i noticed that my delivery was in the york delivery depot to be delivered tomorrow .
2	after_contacting my retailer about this they informed that my delivery had in fact gone to the wrong depot and that it is out for delivery tomorrow .
2	dpd couldn_'_t even be_bothered to inform_me of their error .
2	if i hadn_'_t contacted the retailer , like a lemon i would have waited indoors all day for a delivery which was never going to materialise .
2	i cannot_fault the retailer and the after sales service which they provided was very useful .
2	just one final note .
2	unlike_other courier companies , i discovered that i could only contact dpd via their email enquiry_form .
2	there is no contact number to talk to a real_life human_being .
2	in future i will be thinking twice on which courier company i wish to use .
2	even if i have to pay that little_bit more , the service has got to be better_than the problems i '_ve encountered from dpd today .
2	i recently ordered an internal compact_flash card_reader for a computer i '_m building .
2	i ' d never used bt shop before and was hesitant in my order being successful if it was anything like their telephone service .
2	at the time i placed the order it was late at night so wasn_'_t expecting the goods to arrive for at_least 0 days .
2	despite the product only costing_£_00 i wasn_'_t given an option of paying a premium delivery charge for a scheduled day to prevent me from imprisoning myself at home for a few_days until it arrived .
2	that was the first detail which didn_'_t impress me .
2	a few_days_later i received an email to say that the product i ordered had been_discontinued and that my order had been cancelled and no funds had come out of my account .
2	in a panic i contacted my bank to confirm that .
2	i then contacted bt to ask why i was able to submit my card info to them for an item which had been_discontinued .
2	they said , and i quote , " it was a mistake ".
2	minutes after i ended that phone conversation i searched on google for an_alternative company to buy this card_reader and who in my search_results do i see selling the same product ?
2	that '_s right .
2	bt .
2	they haven_'_t even removed the product from their website .
2	so from my first and last shopping_experience with bt , do not buy from them unless you want to end up being disappointed .
2	i was dubious_about ordering expensive computer_components from this company .
2	whenever i order goods from websites i '_ve never used again , i rarely use a company where i have no direct contact number to reach them on .
2	however , compared with other_websites , their prices were way lower_than that of their competitors so i risked it .
2	and boy did my first purchase with them pay off .
2	you get endless emails regarding your delivery plus texts messages .
2	the last text i got from them was this morning to say my motherboard would be delivered between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 .
2	then at 00 : 00 there '_s a knock on my door and there it was .
2	can '_t say any better_than that .
2	i always use amazon uk as for first_port of call .
2	should i find the same goods cheaper_elsewhere i always ask myself the question .
2	but what if something_goes_wrong ?
2	sometimes it '_s a case of better the devil you know .
2	having used wanapart on more than one occasion to source parts for my ford scorpio in africa i have been extremely impressed with the expertise of the sales_team , the speed and absolute reliability of the service and the competitive_pricing of the parts supplied .
2	i will never go_elsewhere .

2	we purchased four audio_technica atw - 000 / h wireless headworn systems for use in our puppet presentations .
2	i contacted the organisation and was given very helpful and knowledgeable advice on radio systems .
2	this was invaluable to us as our knowledge of radio systems is pretty basic and saved us from making a costly_mistake .
2	the price was competetive and delivery was prompt .
2	we would highly_recommend sound_exposure .
2	well_done arbico , this is my second purchase of a computer from this company and for any_prospective customer out there , make a note of the name .
2	delivery was spot on , all equipment was in pristine_condition , and when i had to ring customer_support regarding a small issue , this was dealt_with immediately without_any_problems .
2	all in all , i highly_recommend this company and would not_hesitate to use again for any future_purchases .
2	arrived amazingly quickly - great company .
2	can only be impressed with the service that is offered by pcspecialist .
2	was given constant_updates on progress and most impressive were the actual dispatch and delivery details that were spot on .
2	the product itself is excellent and well built .
2	would definitely recommend to others or use again if opportunity_arises .
2	very happy customer
2	arrived really quickly .
2	would recommend this site .
2	i have used offtek for a number of years , they have never failed to deliver an exemplary service .
2	as a company they are both trustworthy and efficient , they offer an extensive_range of top quality goods at very competitive_prices .
2	their website is easy to navigate and find what you are looking for and they always deliver in record time .
2	i have purchased various items from mobilefun , the last being items for my ipad .
2	their website is brilliant , clear and concise , their products always deliver what they promise and the speed of service never_disappoints .
2	their products offer and deliver excellent value for money .
2	i have recommended them to friends on numerous_occasions and will happily continue to do so .

2	i have now been ordering my lenses from feel good for over a year and during that time they have always been the cheapest , providing branded lenses , with almost next_day delivery !
2	fantastic !
2	despite ordering something shown as ' in stock ' on the website and payment being taken immediately , it '_s now been almost two_weeks and still no delivery .
2	their customer contact is poor - only after i contacted them and they took several days to reply and promised to get goods to me but after another week still_waiting .
2	have now cancelled order and asked vredit card company to take action to recover money .
2	do not deal with these shysters .
2	i was very pleased with the service i received from age_partnership , mr rossetti was very good . no high pressure_selling . he was very professional and helpful in setting_up the transfer of my pension from another company and helping to set_up my new pension through age concern . i would recommend this company anytime . well_done . 000000
2	easy to understand website with helpful information on which memory goes with your motherboard .
2	delivery was very quick , and i will use again when i need memory .
2	keep_up the good work .
2	i orded a new iphone0 on the 00 / 00 /_0000 , waited 0 days for the delivery but nothing arrived .
2	then i got a email from leslie grant asking to email her a photo copy of the card i used to order the goods , a utility_bill , my driving_licence , and my passport .
2	i then got a email from her saying she had contacted her dispatch team to handle my order in a priority basis , but still no phone .
2	since then money was taken from my account and still no phone .
2	if you ring up you have to wait up to 0 / 0 hour at_least before you can speak with some one . i have never been treated this way by any company i have delt_with and i will never use this company again .
2	the customer is not king at this place and they use your money to finance their compay .
2	very easy to use , easy to pay - everything_went great !
2	i just rescued an iphone 0 that was destined for the bin !
2	the power_button had completely jammed .
2	did a search , found rottenapples and thought their repair price was reasonable ,
2	sent it away and got it back 00_hours_later !
2	still can '_t quite get my head around that !
2	amazing service !
2	i saved a lot of money by parking within walking_distance of kings_cross !
2	the website is easy to use , the rate was sensible and the instructions were simple !
2	everything was just perfect really !
2	decided to sell the phone on monday_afternoon , money in the bank on tuesday_morning !
2	i still don_'_t know how they did it so quick - isn_'_t the future a wonderful place :-)
2	best rates i could_find , quick , simple and great ongoing feedback !
2	perfect really !
2	a good experience - would use again
2	efficient & helpful
2	great simple website and interparcel standard - ups offer an excellent service
2	when a parcel is lost there is limited help and phone number is a premium_rate number .
2	i have used them a great deal in the past but now a parcel is lost when i need their help they just are not interested in contacting you with updates .
2	in fact i have found they almost avoid contact and then make it very hard to speak to them without it costing you a small_fortune .
2	if you book with a courier they at_least then have a free number and a person to speak to who will help .
2	i would avoid parcel 0 go
2	arrived next_day well_packed and as_described
2	great service and company
2	ordered a 0000l bunded oil_tank and after 0 days made contact with bhl to be told there is a delay .
2	they claim to deliver in a week but mine took 0_weeks to arrive .
2	then on appointed delivery date guess_what no show !
2	waisted whole day at home on advice of delivery that never showed ..... not great .
2	then when arrived came on small lorry that had had the tank loaded on via forklift but the tail_lift was too small for tank to be lowered on so precarious balancing act in getting it off lorry .
2	driver did all he could but clearly no thought when loaded such a large item on a small lorry .
2	my old packard_bell easynote came with 0gb_ram but can take 0gb max .
2	it has_been begging for the upgrade to 0gb for years .
2	there were lots of websites with similar ram but mr_memory guaranteed my order of 0x0gb would work with my old easynote sw00 .
2	i was a little_dubious_about not knowing exactly which manufacturer of ram i was buying but was assured by mr_memory that it would be " one of the top 00 ".
2	well , very quickly and perfectly packaged my 0x0gb dimms arrived and i could see they were genuine_samsung dimms , a superb ram manufacturer .
2	working now in my laptop nicely , thank_you .
2	low price , fast dispatch , all you need
2	what a change to find a provider who includes the pet price initially most of the others don_` t , so what do i have to do ring up , ching ching , pain in the rear . not withstanding i am confused by the car and several passengers cost ie 0 passenger or several the cost is the same ...... why am i then charged for a small dog who has to remain in the car . not forgetting i usually have to do the scanning for the desk bound check in person . otherwise a good provider .
2	excellent product first_class service will be using again
2	i have just recieved my hublot classic fusion from iconic , the whole_process of buying has_been excellent , james was very knowledgable when i first contacted them and gave_me the options they had . next_day delivery after payment will_definately recommend and use in the future , also the price was the best i could_find

2	did not buy one single item from argos this christmas as nearly every item seen on the website cannot be reserved for store pick_up as out of stock not good enough and i went elsewhere
2	ordered item for a christmas_present .
2	was delivered within 00_hours however as this was a gift it would have been nice to have packed the item rather_than just putting an address_label on the outside of the box so the contents were shown .
2	box got wet in the rain and became tatty

2	i ordered a asus x00ca of this company , which i was assured that it would be delivered today 00 / 00 /_0000 anytime up to 0pm .
2	after numerous phone_calls to yourselfs and being assured by your telephone operators it will be here by 0pm at the latest today no sign of the said asus_laptop .
2	i honestly think the laptop was never dispatched or even existed and this company and thier subsidiary companys are completely false and thier nothing but a bunch of shysters .
2	my advice is forget about buying anything from them and spend your hard earn , t money , with a honest reputable_company , mr n . s cheeseman basildon essex

2	i bought a fully enclosed shower from them it cost over £ 0000 it had two doors when the plumbers were installing it they found they had sent two left doors i rang them uo and they said we will send you the right door in a couple of days so the plumbers came back a few_days_later to put the right door in and i had to pay them a extra £_000 for the extra visit i contacted b and q and after lots of phone_calls over many days i got £_000 back
2	i bought a android_tablet from them but wasn_'_t happy with it i rang them up seven months later and told them this they said no problem send it back next_day it was collected and a little while later i got a full_refund even including my postage i have been shopping with them since they started and have always had a very good service from them ok they might not be the cheapest retailers but you have the knowledge that if you are not happy with the product you will get your money back where else could someone buy a ring and after having it a few_days deciding its not suitable get refunded the purchase price ?
2	i was let_down by a firm called taps0less i found prestige_bathrooms on the internet and it was a very friendly experience and i got the taps i wanted with a good delivery service so very pleased all_round

2	geoff leonard
2	a0 excellent , will_definitely shop_here again .
2	spent an_hour argueing that the item i wanted to return was not medication , and i wanted a refund .
2	they refused , stating it was medication and thats the end of that .
2	be aware consumers , to check what you order is refundable before you part with your money .
2	i was really pleased the flowers came safe and sound , i have really added to my brownie_points !
2	i needed 0 tyres for my vespa gts 000 , and looked around the usual websites hoping for a bargain , they were all priced around the £_00 mark , until i looked at this site !
2	i couldn_'_t believe they were selling the tyres that i wanted for £_00 !
2	i ordered on monday , they were here on wednesday , briliant service and price , well_done oponeo , keep it up !
2	the appartment exceeded all of our expectations and we look_forward to staying there again .
2	the owner made every effort to ensure that everything_ran_smoothly for our stay .
2	the roof terrace was superb and having the key to our own penthouse lift was fun . we would thoroughly reccomend a stay here to anyone
2	easy to find the correct_memory for any compputer .
2	the instructions to install were perfect .
2	the packaging was perfect .
2	sent and delivered on time .

2	ordered , arrived , right price , no more to say !
2	good service from this company , goods arrive quickly and well_packed .
2	unless you prefer spending hours or even days sitting on your bum waiting and wondering , doing the will they / won_'_t they ?
2	stuff ... don_'_t use these_clowns .
2	i booked a collection with yodel00 ( 00 .. 00_hours .. this is a joke believe me ) for monday .
2	i waited in all day , nothing , looked at the on line tracking and at 0 :_00pm it said " van not ready ".
2	mmmm .. read in to this what you may , i substituted van with yodel .
2	re - scheduled for tuesday and waited in all day and ditto no - one came .
2	rescheduled for wednesday and ( awww , you ' re ahead of me aren_'_t you ?)
2	ditto .
2	three_days sitting_around waiting !
2	cancelled under dsr and booked it with <_external link_removed >, who turned_up promptly at 0000am , spoke english , and collected .
2	to anyone who has got angry with a supplier who_uses_yodel , please don_'_t get angry with them .
2	they , like me thought they were dealing_with a reputable_company , and have been mistaken , taken for a ride and lost money on it .
2	take my advice , don_'_t use yodel ( anything ), they are the one '_s who deserve to go out of business not the people who use them !
2	ps , it says under here inform yodel about my review .
2	why ?
2	do i think they will care ?
2	as header , good service - seamless with supplier
2	well i '_ve actually had one faulty goods delivered , it was rma ' ed back to them .
2	they collected , they told me when it had arrived back , and they dispatched another , which arrived swiftly .
2	sh0t happens !..
2	but they sorted it all out brilliantly .
2	goods often arrive before they should ( er .. what other company has ever done that !!!
2	?..... in fact it happened just today !, my sd_card should have arrived tomorrow )
2	i always get through quickly on the phone when ever i need to , the website is a breeze , with real stock_levels , once there was 00 in stock , i deliberated , then went for it and then there was none in stock , in the space of twenty_minutes , drat !
2	he who hesitates !
2	!... but it shows it works folks !!.
2	do take_note camerabox !!
2	i just don_'_t have anything other than praise for this company .
2	it '_s worth_noting that a few_years a go this wasn_'_t the case , but the company obviously recognised the problems and in my opinion have gone way overboard to put it right .
2	i would , and have recommended this site to my friends , relatives , and to my customers .
2	and no i don_'_t work for them or know anyone who does , i '_ve just had the best experience with them .
2	the stock_levels are hopelessly untrue or not kept up to date .
2	in common with a lot of others , i ordered an " in stock " item , only to find out it wasn_'_t a day later , then after a few calls i was told the stock was going to be in , in a couple of days .
2	then when that deadline expired , in another couple of days , then , when that deadline expired , another week .
2	at that point i cancelled the order .
2	if your item actually turns_out to be in stock you might have better luck , but you won_'_t find out till you place your order , then like me , you are stuck with it !!
2	i wouldn_'_t bother personally with this hassle , there are better on - line retailers , e_- buyer , pixmania etc .
2	each time that i have used these_people the service has_been excellent .
2	frank in lancashire
2	quick delivery , easy to use site .... no_nonsense
2	i have bought 0 items to date from this company , a simulated leather kindle cover , a kindle mains_charger , an fm_transmitter for my ipod and a car cigarette lighter splitter to enable me to use sat_nav & the transmitter simultaneously .
2	all these have been as_described , done the job required and the speed of delivery tremendous .
2	i couldn_'_t recomend the company more highly .
2	cannot_believe we found so much choice at the store ,,, really hard to decide what pieces to purchase ,
2	found fantastic , table and chairs , wardrobes superb ,
2	and even found perfect table for my computer ,,,
2	well happy ,
2	the furniture looks fantastic ,
2	service super ,
2	sales_guy at canterbury was extremely_helpful , and made our shopping_experience fun .........
2	really good service , speedy delivery , and a very good company to do buissness with , friendly and polite service , highly reommend doing buissness with you .
2	after 00 years on an over - firm and less_than comfortable millbrook mattress , i wondered_whether the firm baronet was the right choice .
2	my reservations were completly unfounded and we both think that this mattress is much more comfortable .
2	however it is heavy and as we are now retired it may not get turned as often as suggested , although we will probably be able to rotate it for some years yet .
2	the delivery was exactly as scheduled ( delivered only to inside the front_door ) and the mattress was very well_packed with both double bagging and an outer protection of cardboard .
2	mattressman has exceeded our expectations once again .
2	ordered vacuum_cleaner which was shown as ' available ' but not in stock .
2	the item as delivered a week_later with a scheduled 0 hour delivery slot .
2	will_definitely use this company again
2	the items ordered were at a very competitive price and the whole order was delivered within a couple of days .
2	there was a problem with one item and a replacement was provided without_quibble
2	storage_boxes were exactly_what i wanted good quality at a very good price
2	very easy to use web_site
2	the items were cheaper_than i expected and they arrived after two_days of ordering and amongst the christmas post .
2	well_done
2	would recommend to my friends
2	went to several providers for a round the world trip .
2	selected travel_nation because cali just seemed just seemed to know what we wanted and so it proved .
2	despite us changing our requirements several_times cali took it all in her stride .
2	she obtained some good prices for us .
2	i have bought several products and always found the quality to good .
2	nikki just sorted it out - what more could you want !
2	0st time user of parcel to go , the lady i chatted with emma , made this so easy for me .

2	thank_you , ordering was simple , dispatch was very quick and item arrived on the day specified . i would recommend you everyone .
2	this was my 0nd purchase from panamoz .
2	my first purchase was a 0d_mkiii camera_body at a very low price , this time it was an ef 000 - 000mm_lens .

2	excellent service , no downside ;-)

2	i must pass on my experience of buying an lg soundbar from a company called crampton and moore .
2	i had not dealt_with them before , so did not know what to expect .
2	the price they were selling the soundbar was so competative , though , that i took the chance of dealing_with them online .
2	i am extremely pleased with the item purchased and the feedback and delivery from crampton and moore .
2	i can certainly recommend this company and will go back to them for purchases in the future ,
2	thanks for the service you gave .
2	i got a good price for the phone and i was updated on the process .
2	i will_certainly use you again if i have to recycle a phone in the future .
2	i found go - electrical via a web search and found the dualit_kettle at a very competative price .
2	i have had problems with unknown web sites in the past and was a little_wary of using another that i was not sure of .
2	i can only say that my experience has_been excellent and i am totally_satisfied with price and service .
2	this is the first time i have ever been given such a precise 0 hour delivery schedule and it was bang on time .
2	would rwcommend this online site to anybody .

2	ref_: avis rental_agreement number_000000000
2	rentalcars 000000000
2	i am writing with reference to a very serious complaint i have .
2	i believe that fraud and deceit may have taken place and i will stop at nothing until i have received a letter of apology , my money back , compensation and assurances that such practices will be reviewed and changed where necessary .
2	i had to make a trip to the uk with my prime purpose to visit my mother who had recently been diagnosed with cancer .
2	on this occasion i had decided that it would be easier to rent a car and not rely_on trains etc .
2	i wanted to find a cheap hire car that was situated close to the south_terminal at gatwick_airport .
2	my criteria was simply to get the cost as cheap as possible , and for it to be convenient .
2	i had also asked for air_conditioning due to the hot_weather .
2	my usage was going to be fairly minimal as i was travelling to kent and back , that is all , not a great distance mileage wise .
2	i went online and the best website and price appeared to be through rental_cars .
2	i called them , and they were very helpful on the phone and said that the best deal was with avis .
2	i was happy that it was a name i had heard of , and i paid for the car by debit_card over the phone and i paid a little extra to reduce the excess .
2	i was , at this point happy with the purchase .
2	i arrived at gatwick and went to the avis_desk …. and from then on it ’_s been a nightmare .
2	the man on the desk seemed stern but all i wanted to do was show my passport and licence details and get on the motorway .
2	the avis person insisted he needed a few details , he then asked me if i wanted to get the excess reduced by paying extra .
2	i said i had already paid for this online .
2	then , suddenly he said he needed £_00 . 00 held on my card .
2	i asked why and he said this was for fuel in case i didn_’_t return it with fuel inside it .
2	he then went on to say that this was the maximum_amount i would pay if the tank was empty .
2	i was getting frustrated at this point and i asked why this was not asked for on the phone as i would have paid by card on the phone .
2	he tried to put the card_details through but it didn_’_t seem to work .
2	he then said it needed a manual authorisation and did i have another card i could use .
2	i said no that was the only card i had .
2	reluctantly i persuaded him to call the card people , and after what seemed like a lifetime they eventually spoke to me , asked me a few security questions and authorised the payment .
2	at this point by now 00_minutes of time had lapsed , and the avis man gave_me a small piece of paper with a number on it and a reference and he said they had asked me to call them at some point but that it was not urgent .
2	i said to him that i was not going to call them if it was a survey or something as i had already wasted enough time .
2	( interestingly it was urgent , by the time i got to kent i had several missed calls from the fraud squad wanting to talk to me relating to possible card misuse , and they had put a stop on the card until i could confirm my identity etc_.)
2	i will of course be speaking to the card company to ask why they didn_’_t talk to me properly when i spoke to them at the airport , however i suspect they may have a recording of what the avis representative said and his “ excuse ” for taking £_00 . 00 .
2	every time i asked about this i was told that this was in case i left the car empty of fuel and that it was a holding payment .
2	i was finally given the rental_agreement to sign and i queried the excess amount stated on there and the avis representative said that this was just how the agreement printed out but i would not have to pay the excess .
2	finally i got in the car and was able to drive away , quite stressed after what seemed an unnecessary delay and rudeness by all involved , not a great first “ hire car experience ”.
2	however the car given was a nice citroen , despite not being the car i had paid for and promised .
2	two_days_later i returned the vehicle , well within the time allocation , i had thought there would be a garage close to the airport , but i didn_’_t see one .
2	i told the guy this when i dropped it off , but said there was still three_quarters of a tank left .
2	he said no problem .
2	to be honest i expected at some point to see a £_00 /£ 00 charge for fuel on my bank_statement .
2	on tuesday the 00th_august i noticed £_00 had been taken out of my account by avis .
2	first of all i must stress that i deem this to be theft and fraud .
2	i called avis immediately to a man called barry granderson .
2	barry was not rude but very very unhelpful and useless .
2	first of all despite me making it clear that i would speak to trading_standards , the fraud squad , your directors and the media ( i work for the media ), he insisted he would not be able to respond for five days .
2	totally_unacceptable .
2	he then went on to say that i had opted for the pre_- payment fuel option and that i should have returned the vehicle as empty as possible .
2	he then said i had signed a contract and i also highlighted that many people signed ppi insurance forms but that didn_’_t prevent them being mis_- sold too !
2	this is despite my rental_cars agreement stating :-
2	what you '_ll need to know
2	fuel_policy - the vehicle is supplied with a full_tank of fuel .
2	it should be returned full or refuelling charges will be applied .
2	this being completely contrary to what baryy granderson told me .
2	seven_days have now passed and i have received no communication from anyone and i have not received any payment .
2	today i will be taking the following action :-
2	• writing to your chairman expressing my concern
2	• alerting various media including rogue_traders and watchdog

2	website states ' less_than 00 in stock '; i '_ve been speaking english all my life and this means in stock not out of stock .
2	i realize that zero is less_than 00 but don_'_t accept that this meets any form of trade description .
2	dabs used to be a good & reliable retailer but i won_'_t be shopping there again and would not recommend that you do either .
2	my experience : place order mid_afternoon on friday for in stock item ( less_than 00 ).
2	get immediate_confirmation of order but then hear nothing .
2	tuesday check state of order and discover that it '_s out of stock .
2	check item on site ( still less_than 00 in stock ).
2	cancel order and buy from amazon - cost £ 0 more ; item delivered friday .
2	result ( my wife buys a pile of stuff on ebay on the saturday and it all arrives well before my item does ).
2	really unhappy .
2	the only good thing .
2	no monies were taken so i didn_'_t have to chase for a refund .
2	product arrived promptly ( at xmas time ) and was as ordered .
2	purchasing experience was smooth .
2	highly_recommend .
2	purchased some linctus which comes in a bottle - could easily be broken if not packaged properly .
2	please to say that packaging was what one would expect - almost no chance of damage .
2	highly_recommend .
2	second time buyer .
2	excellent website tracks progress very well .
2	customer service responsive - i needed a very specific delivery day and this went superbly .
2	very pleased with the pricing and ability to customize_your pc .

2	ordering from frost restoration could not be easier , the goods arrived quicker_than_expected and were very well_packed .
2	i '_ve_used por00 in the past so i knew it would work as it should , i '_ll be more than happy to use frost '_s again no_fuss no bother job_done .
2	absolutely superb service , ordered on tuesday delivered wednesday , fitted and working , can '_t praise mr_memory enough ,,,, many_thanks kev .
2	don_'_t switch to first_utility .....
2	ordered it on sunday_evening it was delivered tues
2	i ordered the rdiator on the sunday .. it was delivered tues . friday it was hung on the wall saturday it was running and it sure throws a lot of heat out ... i would have no_hesitation in using you again thank_you very much
2	after being given the runaround by blackcircles competitors who continualy broke promises to price match or return telephone_calls , i was bowled_over by the professional attitude received whilst placing my order for a set of four , continental vanco contact 0 tyres .
2	telephone salesman was a true ' gent ' & certainly knew his product range , informing_me of the specifications , limitations & capabilities of my intended purchase .
2	such a refreshing_change after the truely abrupt attitude adopted by tyretraders . com earlier that same day .
2	confirmation emails were prompt in arriving & ' double - bubble ' iceing on the cake was tesco_clubcard_points for my purchase .
2	delivery was much_faster_than_anticipated 00_hours_later & the courier company did not have me waiting home all day , tyres arrived at 0 . 00am .
2	in summary product & service were second to none .
2	i highly_recommend anyone looking for replacement rubberware to make blackcircles their first & last call .
2	many_thanks for everything blackcircles .
2	i will_certainly be back !
2	service , and delivery , ever so fast .
2	used tooled_- up .
2	com before , and will again .
2	firstly i wanted to know if the bulbs were able to be used with a dimmer_switch , a email was sent the following_day advising this was possible .
2	ordered the same day and recieved the 0 bulbs after the weekend .
2	the items were very well_packed .
2	i would recommend the light_bulb company to anyone .
2	thanks lbc .
2	from the outset , fast , easy and very efficent .
2	will use again and would highly_recommend to anyone .
2	just read all of the reviews , and then if you still go_ahead and sign up with this appalling outfit you will have no one to blame but yourself . i made that mistake and still nearly five months on my issue is un resolved .
2	they don_'_t give a sh0t about their customers .
2	i have used animed_direct a couple of times now and have no_hesitation in recommending them to anyone .
2	good value and fast delivery , i for one will stay with them for any future orders i need fulfilled .
2	bought an item and had it engraved in same shop after about 0weeks the engraving was becoming illegible so took it back to my home town shop to have it rectified , but the person behind the counter spoke down to me as if i was a child so i sent it off to the head_office on about the 0nd of dec , and complained about the poor service i had received but 0weeks had passed without a reply so i then had to phone them to find out what the delay was and they apologized and said they were very busy but eventually sent me a refund , so from_start to finish and from the bottom to the top of this company i have received a very poor and shoddy service , would i recommend or use this company again no !
2	never !
2	i am fortunated enough ( or unfortunate , depending how you look at it !!)
2	to have finished my second mixed box of meat and cheese .
2	firstly , the whole circle of brie , super - creamy , delicious and by far the best ever_eaten !!!
2	superb as a part of a cheeseboard , a filling for celery sticks and wonderful stuffed in a pork fillet , and roasted !!
2	!
2	all the meats were extermely tender , no waste with excess fat ( or injected water !!)
2	and very good value for money compared to supermarket_meat , which seems to be of a lesser quality .
2	my very first corn - fed chicken , and wow !
2	what a difference in the flavour , and sooo moist , the steaks were to die for .. my hubby kept looking at mine , and said that if i was struggling he would help me out , and finish it for me !!
2	how dare he !!
2	!
2	for anyone who has never ordered meat this way , go on , spoil yourself , you will be glad you did !!!
2	the box it comes in is recyclable , ( i gave one to my neighbour , who was moving , so that she could put the contents of her freezer in , for transit to her new house .)
2	the ice_packs have many uses , and the polystyrene lining of the box is perfect for cans at barbequeues , with the frozen icepacks .
2	all in all , its a no - brainer , order and try , you will agree with me !
2	!
2	i '_m really glad i bought this stereo unit , really pleased with it . sounds good , does what i want it to do and is easy to operate the service from hifi_tower and delivery was very fast and the unit was extremely well_packaged . thank_you .
2	this is the second time i have purchased tyres c / w fitting from them and they always have the specific tyre i like , avon_zv0 .
2	but the best thing is the choice of places for fitting so where ever i am i can use the local fitting service .
2	brilliant !
2	by the way i save between £_00 to £_00 per_tyre .
2	can '_t fault this company , they even gave_me good advice on coffee selection .
2	acquistato con un_po ' di timore per il prezzo incredibilmente conveniente .
2	qualche preoccupazione per possibili inserimenti non previsti da parte degli organi di svincolo .
2	nessun problema ; numero di tracciamento e servizio preciso di dhl .
2	in ddue giorni lavorativi avuto il pacco da hk !
2	everyting perfect and fast : i '_ll be back soon for more bargain !
2	thankyou very much !
2	!
2	perfect item and perfect service .

2	i ordered an ipod_dock from zavvi as they were way cheaper_than any other seller , then selected free delivery and it still arrived the very next_day !
2	brilliant !
2	fast delivery excellent price excellent tusted seller 000_%
2	mixed feeling here ................
2	good for buying if you know your prices .
2	bad for selling because of ebay rules which are highly stacked against you , you need a lot of luck with your buyers as i can tell you that all of the idiots in the world also go to ebay just to mess things up and because that you do need a lot of luck not to be dealing_with one of them and if you do you cannot rely_on ebay to help you out .
2	had very bad_experience with these_people and when , yes when ( because they will ) they lose your parcel they don_'_t make much of an effort to find it and instead just pretend that the tracking_number the they supplied does not exist ??????????
2	?/
2	hopeless !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2	!

2	was looking for a north_face plasma thermal jacket but noted at their shop in covent_garden the price was £_000 .
2	went on the white &_bishop website and it was over £_000 cheaper .
2	and delivered next_day at no extra_cost !
2	i '_ll be back .
2	efficient as always and sarah_hayes helped_me out very very promptly when i needed it !
2	cheers
2	at the last_minute my wife decided to work from home on valetines and of course i had arranged for the flowers to be delivered to her office .
2	appreciate that last_minute changes are at my risk but tried to email the morning of the 00th having been unable to get live_chat response .
2	understand it might have been difficult to make the delivery address change even_though it was with a days notice but would really have appreciated some response , well in fact any response would have been good .
2	disappointed
2	the suit was of outstanding quality , everything as_described the delivery was second to none ( 0days from ordering !!).
2	i can somrtimes struggle to get the right fit but this suit was perfect .
2	the price was very good .... even better with 00_%_off .
2	i will_definitely buy again & reccomend to all my friends & collegues .
2	i '_m looking for the perfect shirt & tie to go with the suit so will be spending my bt points !!!

2	all in all excellent ..... 0 ★
2	i bought 0 tubs of rendagrip from this company , ordered on a saturday , delivered free on the monday ... outstanding service ... would definitely recommend you to others ... 0 ★
2	thank_you my mother loved them and described them as the best flowers she had ever had on delivery
2	i used to use another supplier but they ran_out of stock , and online i found these_guys .
2	they ' re cheaper and very quick .
2	i '_ll keep using them .
2	my phone ( n000 ) failed over the easter_weekend and i needed a replacement urgently .
2	however , searching the internet i found that although sites were advertising a price - they didn_'_t appear have any stock as the phone has_been_discontinued .
2	i could only find 0 " recognisable " site ( pixmania ) who said they had a phone in stock ( and at a very reasonable price ).
2	i ordered it with the expectation that they wouldn_'_t have one in stock - but i had little choice ( other than 0nd_hand on e_- bay ).
2	however , on tuesday ( after the bank_holiday ) i got an email_saying it was on it '_s way and it arrived on wednesday_morning - fab !
2	- and it works_fine .
2	fast service very helpful ..
2	being based in the uk it is understandable for consumers to feel a little_concerned_about dealing_with overseas organisations but , in this case , i have faith_restored and am pleased to convey to any readers that .
2	logomojo is a talented company that will put your mind at ease and will deliver an excellent business tool .
2	wanted a round the world trip stopping at san francesco , fiji , auckland , christchurch , brisbane and hong_kong with hotels , phoned rtw and everything was finalised within 0_weeks excellent !
2	i can not fault any of the events i took part in , you guys are are doing a great job , i wish you more positive improvement in future .
2	ordered christmas day arrived on 00th_december .
2	amazing service over the holiday_period .
2	easy web_site to use , loads of offers , excellent selection and loads of information .
2	will use again for my hi_fi rquirements
2	this was the first time i used juno and am chuffed .
2	really good price , well_packed item and next_day delivery .
2	i have used kenable several_times over the years and have only praise for their service .
2	ordered , it came , and now it '_s hanging on the wall .
2	great service , does_exactly_what it says on the tin .
2	i will be using the service again , and again .
2	excellent fast service , good quality lenses , very happy !
2	this is the second time i have used lightbulbs . com .
2	i would like to thank them for their fast and uncomplicated service .
2	excellent fast and friendly service , i '_ll be using them again .
2	i have found the interparcel service exceptional , if i was giving out blue peter badges then they would be at the top of my list .
2	occasionally i have had cause to make a personal call to their customer_services , every time i am greeted with a polite and knowledgable person , who acts swiftly to confirm or resolve any_queries i may have .
2	all in all a 0_star service .
2	our online order for 00 bottles of wine was due to be delivered 00th_december_0000 .
2	we waited in all day .
2	we are still_waiting !
2	!
2	tesco say their courier delivered it .
2	but to whom and when ?.
2	it certainly did not get to us .
2	this is an ongoing dispute .
2	at the moment i do not trust tesco !
2	!
2	with all the scam and fraud on the internet , i had my doubts .
2	i took a risk and i am happy to say that highlands titles is everything it claims to be and more .
2	i bought my plot a year_ago and was totally_satisfied .
2	many friends have done the same since and are very pleased .
2	my great - grandfather , william semple , came from scotland to quebec city , canada in 0000 .
2	thank_you highland_titles .
2	lord douglas errol semple .
2	it helps that p0d is based in nearby banbury , so using them is supporting_local business , but i have used these_guys to send parcels throughout the uk for a number of years and never been disappointed .
2	always efficient and the time and attention they have putting into their online service is obvious .
2	top_marks !
2	been with scottish widows for many_years as a customer and never once had call to regret my decision .
2	the staff are excellent : all uk_based , all easily_accessible through a short automated ' phone service .
2	interest_rates are more than acceptable - never the lowest of the low but you get what you pay for .
2	communications are always quick and efficient .
2	you get exactly the information required and actions are swift and professional .
2	i sometimes have a look around to see what i would save by switching .
2	saving £_00 a month but losing the efficient widows service would be a step backwards for me , so we have stayed put to date .
2	i can '_t see that changing .
2	i needed a second business line at home so contacted chess_telecom .
2	the sales_guy was very helpful and signed me up no problem .
2	customer service since then has_been utterly miserable .
2	promised connection in 00 - 00 working_days .
2	a month later still not connected and chess advised a minimum wait of three more weeks .
2	i cancelled the contract and the embarrassed employee promised that the money they had already started taking by direct_debit would be refunded .
2	since then , no refunds but plenty more bills !
2	the latest one has just arrived , for £_000 !
2	i have emailed and sent letters to no_avail .
2	i am completely fed_up with chess_telecom and will be making a formal_complaint to cisas first thing in the morning to get this sorted_out .
2	my advice is pay the extra with bt , as they may be more_expensive but they generally do what they say they '_ll do , when they say they '_ll do it .
2	no one trying to run a small business and paying through the nose for slow broadband should have to deal with amateurs who can '_t pass simple customer status flags from contracts to accounts , and continuously charge for services not rendered due to incompetence / record overpromising .
2	deal was completed with no_hassle and very satisfied
2	well , i '_ve booked hotel / apartments through alpharooms numerous_times over recent years .
2	their website is easy to use for bookings and pretty quick considering the number of accomodation options they offer .
2	of course , over time there are bound to be a few glitches and i '_ve had two recently .
2	one trip , we arrived to find our apartments closed and the address we were given was wrong .
2	luckily , we sorted this out at the resort and the fault seems to have been with the accomodation providers , who change our booking !
2	on our return , we reported our problems to alpharooms and their customer_services people investigated .
2	they then sent a very detailed reply and , although not really their fault , gave_us 00_% refund on the booking .
2	the second problem was trying to change a future booking .
2	this is where their website is not so good !
2	everything was eventually sorted but it did take a very long phone_call .
2	but overall , still 0 - star compared to a lot of booking sites .
2	i have never tried this sort of service before however , i was very pleased with the smoothness of this hassle_free service , everything_went as they said it would and the communication and superb ,,, great value for money and saved me hours in transfer_bus rides .... will_definitely use this service and provider again ...
2	original , contemporary and cutting_edge .
2	there is a niche for this and also the ability to expand and develop further .
2	good luck , i am sure it will be a great success ....
2	i don_'_t bother even looking anywhere_else , i know i '_ll get exactly_what i want , when i want .
2	perfect .
2	and a chocolate , too .
2	had to cancel my order as i had ordered a wrong item .
2	was dealt_with efficiently and without hassle .
2	ordered some parts .
2	needed to change the order .
2	was dealt_with very efficiently and with email confirmation .
2	very speedy delivery .
2	highly_recommended
2	ordered samples which came super_fast .
2	decided on cloth and placed order .
2	had blind back in a week .
2	excellent quality - happy with the product .
2	would use again and definitely recommend to others .
2	smooth_transaction so happy_bunny .
2	got what i ordered
2	smooth_transaction - got what i ordered at a good price .
2	very happy .
2	first got battery changed 0 years_ago - watch came back scratched and stop - watch function didn_'_t work .
2	had it fixed elsewhere .
2	went back today as i had the " lifetime_guarantee " for the battery .
2	they were very rude and unhappy to replace the battery under guarantee but had to as i had the paperwork .
2	cam back even more scratched and they haven_'_t closed the back propoerly - and this on a watch meant to be waterprrof to 00m .
2	keep away if you value your watch .
2	they price matched an item for me very rapidly and delivered it the next_day .
2	couldn_'_t ask for better service really .
2	very impressed , will_definitely use again and again
2	ordered some vacuum_cleaner accessories ( bags , filters ) over the weekend .
2	arrived by thursday of following week .
2	goods as_described .
2	ordered a pc case .
2	was cheapest even including their 0 . 00 delivery charge .
2	was delivered by courier in 00_hours .
2	excellent .
2	ordered monitor and got it next_day - great price and excellent service .
2	recommended .
2	ordered glasses - i like the way you can search the frames database by specifying shape , colour , material , brand etc .
2	very handy as it saves browsing through hundreds of frames if you know what you want .
2	they should make it clear that polarised_lenses cannot be put into semi - rimless or rimless style frames ( this is because the edge of the lens is not tinted so will look very odd as will be visible with semi - rimless or rimless_frames ).
2	good customer service and prompt delivery .
2	recommended .
2	having worked through a number of samples suggested by the information provided on the web_site , i finally_settled on a favourite and promptly received a bulk supply .
2	now i am not disturbed_by the unfortunate snoring of my partner - " snorestore to the rescue !"
2	i was able to order a kitchen that fitted my space better_than i could_find from any other diy source at a very competitive price .
2	items were customised for me where needed and the whole kitchen was delivered exactly when diy said it would be , with nothing missing or damaged .
2	everything fitted together beautifully and everyone who has seen it has_been really impressed with the result .
2	diy would be my first , and probably only , port of call if i have another kitchen to refit .
2	can '_t believe_how easy the whole_process was ,
2	i bought an acoustic_guitar from cash_generator .
2	the instument new would have cost £_000 . 00 .
2	new .
2	i got it for £_000 . 00 .
2	and it was as new .
2	it arrived in just a couple of days .
2	what more can i say but , " thumbs_up to the store ".
2	easy ordering_process , quick feedback on dispatch schedule and tracking .
2	goods arrived next_day , well_packed and as ordered .
2	excellent all_round service , thank_you .
2	i have tried a few company '_s like this but know one can come any way near this companies efficiency of supply and delivery , and the price is very competitive .
2	the service of this company is beyond all of its kind and is a comforting thought when in this recession were companies are running thin and lean to be able to make a fast buck , but this company keeps its eye on the ball and never looks for short cuts . there products speak for themselves only the highest of named products deal with them and this is testament to a company that will survive and hold on to its massive customer base . i like me many tried this company for the first time and was shocked at the quality of service , within 00_mins of placing my order on line the company phoned to acknowledge the order and they assured me they would follow the sale through to the end and keep me informed , which the did . the samsung_ue00d0000 tv & samsung bdd0000 blu - ray_player arrived as promised in perfect state and on the day they stated .
2	well_done multizone , i will be visiting you again .
2	very highly_recommended
2	great service from double0tickets .
2	easy booking and got great seats for robbie_williams at the etihad on the saturday_night .
2	email communication from double0 to let_me know the tickets were on their way and they arrived securely just over a week before the concert .
2	recommend .
2	you always know you wont have to wait long for your order to arrive
2	delivered very quickly after ordering , and undamaged . i will buy again in the future .
2	as usual very good prices and delivered very quickly no_hassle .
2	really easy to use website and ordering .
2	the products always come within a few_days .
2	i '_ve_used optimal_print twice_now , and they were excellent both_times .
2	the printing quality is exactly as i expected , the price is very competitive and the items are delivered quickly .
2	what more could anyone need !
2	i bought a giant xct composite 0 from pauls cycles a week_ago .
2	everywhere_else it was about £ 0000 .
2	pauls cycles were selling it at £_000 - a substantial_saving .
2	most reviews were good about them so i placed the order ( using the 0 month interest free finance_option ).
2	i received the contact details from the finance company almost straight_away , but no confirmation from pauls cycles .
2	so i called the 0 days after i placed the order and they said they definitely had received the order , but were unusually busy .
2	i needn_'_t have worried , the bike appeared 0 days_later ( within 0 working_days ) and after setting the handle_bars , the pedals and the seat up , the bike was all in perfect working order .
2	well_done pauls and thank_you !
2	received phone battery in 0 days - excellent service .
2	ordered a pair of clic frames with my new prescription fitted , order for was easy to use and also the attach a photo of your prescription for checking was simple .
2	glasses arrived in just over 0_weeks .
2	no_fuss , great service , great price .
2	would definitely recommend .
2	had used event_tyres about 0 years_ago and as i had changed cars this was the first time since then that i needed tyres .
2	they managed to fit me in the next_day as i was in a bit of a pickle with 0 illegal tyres as they were worn bald on the inside edges .
2	the fitter , shane watson , made contact as agreed in the morning giving me an estimated time between 00 & 0 to be confirmed when he was en - route .
2	at 00 : 00 he called to say he was 00_minutes away .
2	when he arrived there was no_messing_around , once i had given him the locking_wheel_nut_key he got straight to the job .
2	0 tyres_fitted and the other 0 checked for wear with the advice that they were still legal but not by much .
2	all told job_done in about 00_minutes at a great price .
2	well_done shane and event_tyres .
2	the service was prompt , flexible and extremely professional .
2	had my mountaineering equipment delivered to switzerland in no time .
2	i purchased my tickets for eddie izzard 0 months ahead of the event and although i had to wait a while before knowing exactly where we would be seating , as promised , we had great seats and i would not_hesitate in using and recommending this website in future .
2	great communication and very quick , free delivery .
2	great company , fantastic prices free delivery over £_00 with next_day delivery what more could you ask for .
2	excellent company , items arrived_safely and quickly .
2	i have ordered quite a .
2	lot from vio_vet and have never had a problem with any of the orders . most of the orders have been delivered within 0 days of ordering .
2	would have no_hesitation ordering from this company again , very fast delivery and great product .
2	karcher wv00 performance exceeded_expectations and fully_justified score given by other_reviewers .
2	i also would give it 0_*.
2	goods as promised with rapid delivery .
2	visited the showroom near hinckley on a weekday mid_morning .
2	the staff were very helpful and even if they didn_'_t know the answer to a query they would take the time to find out .
2	we were interested in a particular biofuel fire which was not available on site .
2	usually they would arrange for it to be sent out or for collection another day , however as we were keen to bring the item home with us they arranged with a local storage_facility for us to collect straight_away .
2	ok , not difficult but also not something which is so easily managed by most businesses today , it just needs that bit of personal care and attention which quatropi provided .
2	we also were interested in hi_fi storage_unit which had recently disappeared from their website , which turned_out to be discontinued but they had one on their own wall , and so promptly offered us a discount , dismantled the unit and carefully_wrapped it for us to take away .
2	very pleasing experience , and there was plenty of other items in their warehouse which caught our eye so i expect we will be back !
2	i have just sold my rolex milgaus and got the best price on the market as i shoped around through the well_known names on the high_street . after selling my watch without_any_problems i would deal with watchfinder when buying a watch . as the service was great .
2	good products and service at a great price
2	did what it said on the tin !
2	they are the cheapest place to park your car , while you are away

2	product is great quality and price also
2	will recommend and use again
2	this site is very well_laid_out making it very easy to compare all the various_sites at a glance
2	i compared a number of company '_s for their exchange_rates for us_dollars ace - fx came out best including home feliver .
2	the order was placed , confirmation received and the money arrived a couple of days_later , thank_you .
2	we have tried other valet_parking , all very good but left waiting for pick - up or collection too many_times , over 00_minutes on a couple of occasions .
2	for this trip it was all too easy , pull in , park , get receipt , return , collect keys and away .
2	the only really stress_free parking method .
2	i ordered this on a thursday and to keep the price down , used their 0 - 0 day delivery service and as this was an expensive monitor their checking service as well .
2	the original delivery date was not for a full 0 days ( 0 days for checking the monitor + 0 days for delivery ), but the monitor was delivered today , just 0 working_days after ordering .
2	great service and well recommended .
2	i called them to get help with sizing and they were very helpful indeed .
2	very good buying experience .
2	very good order processing , fast shipment , communication and delivery .
2	product exactly as_described .
2	i am very satisfied with the product and the software .
2	called the support desk once and was very satisfied with the technical_support provided .
2	great customer service , quality and stylish menswear purchased at the right price .
2	very affordable with special_offers .
2	absolutely perfect in all_respects .
2	delivery , value for money , excellent product , size .
2	no more to say really .
2	the service is excellent and the site is easy to navigate which makes this a must use for anyone buying goods from ebay
2	i signed_up for giffgaff after experiencing double - billing hell with virgin , expecting something better .
2	what i got was far worse !
2	i was one of the unlucky ones who got caught in a website outtage so my recurring goodybag did not recur .
2	there was no notification of this and i did not get some rather important emails i was waiting for .
2	fair_enough , they do not claim to supply a business - strength service but an_apology rather_than a load of criticism of me ( the customer ffs !)
2	and self - righteous gobbledegook would have been fine .
2	not only did my goodybag not recur , but i was unable to top - up in any way on my account - so effectively they managed to brick my phone !
2	through all of these hassles there is no one to call up and talk to - you are forced to use their stupid forums where idiots who do not know what they are talking_about and have nothing better to do spam you with useless and inane comments so they can get a few_pence off their next bill !!!
2	or contact their agents who take 00_hours to respond and then give you an equally useless stock response which indicates they have not even read your question .
2	when they finally do read it you will get a bunch of patronising garbage about how great they are and not much else .
2	when my phone finally came back on line after three_days i was told that my blackberry services ( yes , i know , sad isn_'_t it ) would take another few_days to resume , even_though i had paid for them , but they weren_'_t sure exactly how long ...
2	i got on the phone to o0 - talked to a human - they had me sorted with a new account in 00_hours which has_been sweet ever_since and costs about the same !
2	if it were possible to give negative stars i would give them a hundred - do not use them they are total c_** p !
2	super selection , great prices , beat competitor '_s prices with discount too , and at your door in no time , plus free stuff !
2	awesome !
2	no fewer than five emails promised a delivery date which was not met .
2	three emails claimed that goods had been sent when they had not been .
2	their web - site claims ' lambdatek started in 0000 ' although the company was established in 0000 - this is easy to check at companies house , and i did so .
2	this company provided the absolute worst customer experience which i have seen .
2	company employees refuse to provide names of directors and no email_addresses are available .
2	stay_away !
2	an extremely professional , knowledgeable , helpful & pleasent company to deal with .
2	customer service alway get back to you in reasonable time .
2	if you have problem or concern about your purchase , they sort it out .
2	they got the manufacture to phone me within 00_minutes from me getting of the phone .
2	problem sorted
2	delivery was fast with email_confirming dispatch & tracking_number .
2	personal thanks to mark & chris
2	the salesperson was very helpful and helped_us make our choice .
2	no power selling .
2	we debated for over 00 months before we chose the item .
2	good choice in the end .
2	kevin at birmingham was excellent with his service .
2	delivery and follow_up not good enough .
2	there appears to be a reluctance to help once the money has changed hands .
2	dependable , easy and functional !
2	the communication , reliability of the team and quality of the products all score ' excellent ' in my opinion .
2	better_than any company i have dealt_with !
2	definitely recommend !
2	it was very easy to arrange over the internet , the purchase of the shower_door .
2	i had a phone_call to specify when they could deliver it as it was not in stock .
2	it arrived 0 days_later , on a monday when no one was at home but they brought it on wednesday_evening the same week , at a convenient time for us .
2	would most certainly use their services again !
2	i have generally dealt_with william who remembers me ( even when he spoke to my wife ) and always seems like an old friend .
2	i have never been disappointed with the dialaflight service whether travelling long_distance or shorter journeys on budget_airlines .
2	i have also never been able to find a cheaper comparative price .
2	i can_honestly_say that dialaflight have taken a great deal of stress out of my travel_arrangements .
2	i will_definitely be a returning customer and would recommend them to anybody .
2	dave cochrane
2	best price i could_find for four winter_tyres with tyres delivered quickly , as advertised .
2	highly_recommended .
2	i would use this company again and again !
2	good door , right price , delivered !
2	if you are looking for a tuxedo for a black_tie event look no further , easy to order , delivered the next_day at a reasonable price .
2	toboggan snow sledge x 0 instock , ordered wed delivered thurs , would use again .
2	this was the second time we had used suntransfers from schiphol airport to eurocamp at dunreill and return .
2	they were prompt , courteous and reliable and i would have no_hesitation in recommending the company .
2	kala ka - fmb baritone ukulele arrived safe and sound today - post free and only three_days after ordering on line - beautiful instrument - and soundly packaged - and £_00 cheaper_than anywhere_else i looked - just the job - well_done nevada_music .
2	rating excellent because mazuma met all my expectations .
2	you can '_t do better_than that - keeping promises and keeping you informed along the way - well_done and thanks .
2	easy to recommend to anyone that asks .
2	a good range of products but the dispatch and delivery were impressive .
2	you are kept_informed at every_stage , first the date of delivery then , nearer the time , the hourly_slot_allocated .
2	the parcel arrived in the middle of that hour , so no hanging about all day .
2	lastly , the goods were well_packed , with good shock - proofing and were consequently undamaged .
2	could not fault this company at all !
2	very polite and extremely efficient !
2	thanks to sam the technician for a superb job well_done .
2	i always chose this as the first check on what the current rates of exchange are then i will check it out regularly over a period to try and determine the trend before i buy , but i always use this site .
2	we ordered a replacement battery for our banding machine and the battery arrived 0 days_later .
2	what more can you ask for
2	i ordered a bed 0 - 0 delivery no actual date specified waited in and it didn_'_t arrive , emailed , no response .
2	telephoned day 0 , 0 and they couldn_'_t locate .
2	delivery company phoned to say it was damaged .
2	i ordered another same schedule .
2	day 0 phone_call to say could they deliver , but we away from home , day 0 - 0 parts arrived without warning , one missing , phoned and they said one piece lost , phoned next_day , still lost and so i have cancelled the order after 00 days .
2	now waiting for the parts delivered to be uplifted .
2	staff don_'_t seem surprised and willing to accept situation , with one exception will , but nobody will pass my calls onto him
2	bitterly disapointed .
2	i entered my required details into a search_engine and mytub came up .
2	glad i made the purchase with this company ,
2	communications from beginning to end , explaining the current_status
2	very quick delivery ..
2	will use again should i require their products .
2	recommended .
2	i ordered a pc which was delivered next_day ,
2	great comms even a text_message giving a time it would be delivered .
2	after 0 days the pc developed a fault ( no fault of box . co . uk ), collection was arranged for the next working day .
2	this is when comms slowed_down and it would take_upto 0 days for a reply , as the pc was out of stock i opted for a refund which took 00 days after chasing up .
2	may be i am one of the few dissapointed customers on this occasion .
2	i am happy with their phone system they know who the customer is by caller_id .
2	will consider purchasing again in the future .
2	loved it .
2	saved four of us a commute to london from all over the country .
2	simple to sign up .
2	simple to use .
2	friendly tone of voice throughout the site and all the correspondence .
2	talk 0 . 0 has_been invented !
2	one week in total from contacting mazuma on their website to receiving my cheque for £_000 !!
2	don_'_t think i could ask for better .
2	visited website on wednesday where i found out how much mazuma were paying for my nokia , friday i received pre_- paid postal packaging , saturday posted phone to mazuma , wednesday received cheque and that included a bank_holiday_weekend .
2	very easy and rapid transaction , i couldn_'_t be more pleased , would recommend to anyone .
2	best price on the internet and delivered promptly .
2	what more can you ask for ?
2	webtog '_s website was clear and intuitively laid_out .
2	ordering_process was straight_forward and my order was delivered within
2	00_hours .
2	though i has no need to use it , the option to " speak to a human "
2	seemed like a nice_touch .
2	good product , good price , quick delivery .
2	i will use this company again and can recommend .
2	very good , quick payment .
2	easy process .
2	i purchased a aztec 0 in 0 camping kitchen .
2	the delivery was prompt .
2	however on receipt of the item and on putting it together we noticed that 0 of the pieces was wrong and the kitchen could not be used .
2	i contacted the customer service team who requested me to send in photographs and an explanation to as what was wrong .
2	i took some photo '_s and sent an email .
2	i received a reply the following_day stating that the correct_part would be sent out to me .
2	i received the correct_part a few_days_later .
2	well_done outdoor_world for sorting_out a problem quickly and hassle_free .

2	was after a computer_desk to match our existing indian wood dining_set we have in the dining_room .
2	found what we liked .
2	got the kids a free drink ( now that made it so much_easier ..) and they even had a toilet ( wife is just as bad ...)
2	had a good look around ( just in case ) ordered ( now that was fast ).
2	delivery was free but meant you could not say when exactly ( another £_00 on a £_000 desk did not seem worth it ).
2	delivery company send you an email and you ring back if not ok .
2	they send you a new date .
2	eventually got it right .
2	please_note that if you reply to their emails they get ignored .
2	so make_sure you update your tel numbers on the website .
2	desk is great and certainly cannot pick fault with anything .
2	the kids_love the massive box it was in which is their new den .
2	eventually we will want to be able to see the tele again so the box will have to go ( note to oneself - remove the kids first ....)
2	i would buy again from them without_hesitation .
2	looks_like value for money .
2	shame i did not see the 0 pound more cost for loss cover as i would have taken it !
2	process is very swift !
2	my wife and i are frequent long distant travelers and have used carlton_leisure many_times .
2	everytime they have met or exceeded the best price i can find .
2	if they cant match / better it they explain_why with valid points .
2	i prefer to use joseph each time as he knows my destinations , prefered airlines and times of travel so i don_'_t have to explain things to him , i just tell him the dates he sorts the rest .
2	he is helpful and easy to deal with even_though we can be awkward !
2	i would recommend both joseph and the other staff at carlton_leisure highly .
2	have been using for several_years .
2	nothing lost .
2	nothing damaged .
2	no_complaints from customers .
2	best service to use , particularly if
2	you have a local 0 / 00 drop - off shop .
2	very easy to print documents and invoices , and easy to track .
2	would recommend to any private person
2	or business .
2	have dealt_with cartridge discount many_times , and would recommend them as
2	competitive , efficient and quick .
2	good company to deal with .
2	very efficient and organised ebayer to deal with .
2	only had one problem .
2	had a parcel returned due to incorrect paperwork .
2	the driver did not take the 0 x invoices as he said they were not needed - but they were !
2	well described and illustrated system which solved a big problem .
2	very easy to fit and use .
2	i wanted a 00 " toshiba smart hd_tv for my sons_00th_birthday .
2	i found power direct on a price comparison website & their price was simply unbeatable .
2	the service was good & the tv was delivered the following_day by a quality courier who sent me a text the previous evening to confirm , which i find a superb feature .
2	overall power direct should be proud of their 0_star service which is well_deserved .
2	i will use you again in the future & strongly_recommend you to my circle of friends & clients .
2	having had an estimate of £_00 for just replacement lenses from a high_street_opticians , i went_onto the glasses_direct website .
2	£_00 for a designer pair of glasses with a second pair free seemed to good to be true .
2	having placed the order i received progress updates via_email & the glasses arrived the day after dispatch .
2	i was well impressed with both_pairs of glasses .
2	i have since recommended glasses_direct to several clients & colleagues .
2	i arranged for city_link to collect a wheel / tyre in london on the 0th_december_0000 .
2	their driver never made any attempt to collect & after being chased by the seller we arranged a further collection date for the 00th_december_0000 .
2	true to form city_link didn_'_t turn_up on the 00th but did on the 00st_december_0000 .
2	then the parcel just disappeared & i thought that i would be making a claim .
2	hopefully the parcel will be delivered tomorrow , just one month after i arranged_collection .
2	i have used city_link regularly over the years , but never again after this experience .
2	the recent change of ownership seems to have marked a deterioration in their service .
2	as always , first_class reliable next_day service .
2	you have never failed to deliver a car battery next_day for battery megastore .
2	you are a winning partnership .
2	could i suggest that you offer a consultancy service to yodel for a substantial fee as they repeatedly fail to deliver on time .
2	i placed an online order with toolstation yesterday for delivery today .
2	since i last ordered online , toolstation have switched from royal_mail to comedians yodel .
2	the order which i required for tomorrow never showed up with yodel today .
2	i have checked the yodel online tracking which is a joke .
2	i have emailed toolstation & cancelled my order as i am not prepared to wait_until yodel get around to delivering to me .
2	i will never again place an online order with toolstation & you out there now also have been_warned .
2	had to get some id cards done for a client who have just set_up independently of the local_council .
2	needed them in a hurry for the launch event and lesar delivered .
2	there was a slight_hitch over the wrong card_holders being supplied but lesar immediately put that right - sign of a good company that deals with problems promptly and reliably .
2	always good communications with the team at lesar .
2	my clients commented on how much_better and more attractive the new cards were than the old local authority ones .
2	will use lesar again .
2	recently i went on a trek with private_expeditions to everest_base_camp did not get there due to altitude and bad legs i decided i couldnt carry on guide arranged to come_back with me back to luckla with instructions to get me accomodation if i couldnt make it plane arranged when i got there and all formalities taken_care off tickets boarding_passes all done back in kathmandu i was picked_up and as i had lost my wallet kumar the local manager arranged with the hotel to give me time to get money organized to pay my hotel etc which efffectivly kept he from being homeless as all my cards etc were gone he checked each day that i was ok i got sorted_out eventually with his help and am now safe home thanks everyone especially kumar and pimba great job all_round jim dowling
2	followed up order query promptly
2	great price for a really good quality dog_food , including delivery the price worked out £ 0 cheaper_than going to tesco for a 00kg_bag of bakers , which i dont rate at all .
2	delivered very quickly too .
2	good price on items and very fast delivery and great communication re despatch etc .
2	delivery to northern_ireland a bit_pricey but this is the case with most mainland sellers , guess its because parcels need loaded on to space shuttle and dropped_off at space station before onward_journey to the distant land of n . i
2	smart excellent product which suits my needs for a table that accommodates two large printers .
2	customer_services gave precise measurements which meant that i knew_exactly how to place the printers which meant that i didn_'_t have the hassle of wondering_whether the printer would fit on the bottom shelf .
2	my son and i spent some time designing the new kitchen layout before we started seriously_considering potential_suppliers .
2	when my wife and i visited the showroom in bristol the lady designer went through the plans and made several suggestions before coming to measure up the site .
2	once we had her draft plans she made the suggestion that we use one of the 0000mm cupboards with drawers rather_than the two 000mm units with shelves we had originally selected .
2	this had a real benefit to my wife who has limited movement in her knees and the advantages are being reaped now that the units have been installed .
2	we are extremely pleased with the quality of the workmanship in the constructed units far better_than any flat - pack installation and at a very competitive price .
2	sammie_taylor helped_me with my enquiry and i have left happy thank_you
2	i ordered a collection for the monday , late_afternoon they cancelled on me , then re booked for tuesday , i spend an_hour on chat trying to explain i was not in tue and they should make it wed but i will be out after 0pm ( that '_s why i booked mon as i was in all day !)
2	someone still came at_000pm to collect on tue after me saying we were out !
2	then again someone came on wed !
2	they said on monday they would upgrade it to a 00 hour delivery so i didn_'_t lose out !
2	it took 0 days to get there , i called them asking why it wasn_'_t delivered they said 00 hour means 0 - 0 days ?????
2	surly the clue is in the title ?
2	00_hours ???
2	on the thursday i contacted them again asking where my parcel was they said they don_'_t know but will let_me know when they are ready , i said no , i need to know now !
2	they said we will let you know , i was not happy !!!!!
2	they never came back and let_me know at all !
2	stay_away from this company !
2	unless you want nothing but hassle and problems !
2	i contacted them again for a full_refund we were arguing back and forth for ages until they agreed to a partial_refund , it just wasn_'_t good enough !
2	i spend 0 days trying to sort this out , over an_hour a day on the phone and on live_chat !
2	bad service stick with [_external_reference_] go !
2	chesstelecom were responsible for delaying our office move by fours weeks , even after we had factored in a " worst - case - senario " 0 month provision .
2	after that we had three_months of invoice errors and have been waiting four weeks while the matter is investigated .
2	in a nutshell ; calls are never returned , emails seldom replied to , " account_managers " who could manage their way out of a paper bag and countless broken_promises .
2	they describe this on their website as award_winning customer service - i beg to differ .
2	i liked the idea of hiring a long lens for a family safari , but unfortunately chose lenses for hire .
2	the lens itself was poorly_maintained , scratched and rattled and the results were less_than pleasing .
2	unfortunately the worst part came after the holiday when threatening emails started to arrive claiming additional_charges .
2	nearly a year on i am still being chased by them highlighting small_print in their t + c '_s and threatening even larger bills .
2	avoid like the plague .
2	ok i have only used it once , but i was given a tracking_number as i dropped the parcel off .
2	went home and checked the details and i could see the parcel was yet to be picked_up .
2	well it would be afterabout 00_minutes !
2	tracked it all the way , no_problems at all .
2	and the price beat royal_mail hands_down .
2	will_certainly use again for larger items .
2	bought a phone form them last november and today it wouldn_'_t turn on .
2	so returned it to my local_store where i purchased it from .
2	they out right refused to accept it as a faulty return , they gave_me a phone number and said i had to return it myself .
2	i explained to them that the whole reason i purchased it from a high_street store is because i wanted to be able to return it quickly if anything went wrong with it .
2	he said that they no_longer accept returns as they cannot do anything with it and blamed it all on the network_provider !????
2	i spoke to the manager and he said exactly the same !
2	the phone is still under_warranty and i now have to return it to the manufacturer myself and deal with them .
2	absolutely_disgusted with them and would recommend to anyone to steer_clear !!!!!
2	!
2	very pleasant service - which is why we used you rather_than another
2	supplier of the same product .
2	very prompt and positive response to our
2	price match request .
2	highly_recommended .
2	the price was very competitive , the lady on the sales line friendly and helpful , and the speed of delivery was fantastic .
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending this company .
2	bought bike off ebay without really thinking_about how i would get it from london to edinburgh .
2	was going to get flight down and drive back ( not a good idea in october ).
2	then i was going to hire van , drive down maybe stay the night then drive back , starting to get a wee_bit dear so typed in couriers in google .
2	most prices over £_000 seen shiply and put my details in and started getting offers over the next couple of days .
2	so picked one that could pick_up and deliver when i needed .
2	got very good deal probably would have cost more to do it myself .
2	very happy and would use again .
2	what a great service .
2	i was quite surprised in the first instance to find that this headband spare was still available , and in stock , even_though my headlight is around 00 years old .
2	the ordering system was simple to use and the free delivery was much_appreciated .
2	the order arrived very quickly and everything was in order .
2	many_thanks for your highly professional service .
2	this company delivered the goods fairly promptly & therefore i will use them again .
2	i ordered a canon_ef lens & slrhut called me within a short time to assure me that my order will be dealt_with promptly .
2	the lens was dispatched via_dhl & arrived , safe & sound , a few_days earlier_than_expected .
2	i have no_hesitation in dealing_with this company again .
2	topcashback it '_s a win_win_win - save_money by shopping online compared to high_street shopping and get cash_back to boot !!
2	!
2	i '_ve currently earned just over £ 0000 just by buying things i would have bought anyway just by shopping through_topcashback !!!
2	!
2	shiply - if you want a courier or removals of any size try shiply .
2	i put my removal onto 0 different removal auction_sites .
2	from the other 0 , i got a total of 0 quotes .
2	from shiply i got 00 !!!!
2	!
2	didn_'_t use the cheapest quote , as i ' d got a piano to move and knew one man and his_van would be hard work , if not impossible !
2	but got a quote which was between £_000 and £_000 cheaper_than quotes from local removal companies .
2	easy web_site to use , great service , delivery and price wow .
2	best delivery i '_ve ever had and you know where your parcel is and exactly when it will be delivered , outstanding service .
2	0st time i have used tyreleader and it won_'_t be the last .
2	previously a happy blackcircles customer until i discovered tyreleader who offer more choice of tyre , a better price , excellent product , excellent service and free delivery .
2	no need to go_elsewhere and compare prices they are the cheapest around and there web_site is brilliant .
2	excellent quality , fast service and well_packaged .
2	great products and plenty of special_offers with very helpful communications , very fast service and i would recommend to anyone , the best value i have seen anywhere including asda .
2	brilliant site and if you follow it you will save_money in lots of ways .
2	great quality and delivery was fantastic yet the price you pay is remarkably cheap .
2	hifi - tower has good communication , willing to answer any questions promptly .
2	the product was exactly as_described , the mounting instructions and template made the installation so easy .
2	also deserving praise was the courier service dpd , the parcel arrived in the 0 hour time span given on the tracking notice .
2	all together a very enjoyable_experience .
2	would strongly_recommend hifi - tower
2	prices ok , but let_down by needlessly slow delivery .
2	will not buy from again .
2	i '_ve bought from quiet_pc for many_years and they have always provided service that cannot be_bettered .
2	helpful , professional , quality products and fast delivery .
2	there isn_'_t a better component shop online .
2	the stuff we '_ve had from graze is ok , no_complaints about quality .
2	but when you realise you '_ve spent £_00 in the last month for four weekly boxes , it is just too expensive for the tiny amount you receive .
2	for people who consider eating a couple of nuts and a sultana a day a " snack " they may be ok .
2	but for most people the tiny trays you receive can be eaten in two or three mouthfuls .
2	but that '_s the idea .
2	to get you to order more boxes and spend more money .
2	i also found the overly matey attitude they assume very grating .
2	they ' re a business , in it to turn a profit .
2	they ' re not my " mates " and they ' re not doing me favours .
2	they ' re selling a product .
2	it '_s a good idea , but the " sell ' em a tiny amount so they '_ll buy more " ethos they seem to have is too transparent .
2	we were waiting for a delivery that should have arrived two_days ago .
2	we checked the tracking_info on the hermes , or herpes as we call them , website .
2	it showed " delivered to porch " two day ago !
2	we don_'_t have a " porch ".
2	after a thorough_search of the garden , bins , patio we could not find anything .
2	hermes /_herpes allow or want contact from their victims as they don_'_t care and their victims don_'_t matter to them .
2	so we contacted the company from which we bought the item .
2	one email and three phone_calls in n afternoon later we received a call from the shop .
2	the lame_excuse they had received from hermes /_herpes was that the " regular " driver was off sick .
2	the stand in driver had " scanned all their deliveries wrong ", whatever that means .
2	so they had not in fact delivered the package .
2	strange how we only received this admission from them after we complained and said we could prove no delivery had been made .
2	we had checked our cctv for the day in question and no one had attempted a delivery !
2	it has still yet to arrive , we have been assured it will arrive today .
2	if we ' re lucky !
2	in august we used hermes /_herpes to send an item we had sold on amazon .
2	a the customer contacted us later to say they had not received it .
2	we checked and found that the hermes /_herpes driver had delivered it by throwing it over a garden_fence !
2	my wife '_s seller status with amazon was downgraded as a result of hermes /_herpes shabby action .
2	even_though we had done everything we could to sort it out .
2	only after a direct email to jeff bezos , the owner of amazon , was my wifes status returned to it '_s former five_star_rating .
2	we will never use hermes /_herpes again .
2	we now ask every online seller we buy from who they use for deliveries .
2	if they say hermes /_herpes we tell them they have lost a sale as a result and we shop somewhere_else .
2	this uncaring , shabby , third rate , pathetic_excuse for a delivery company don_'_t want to hear from their victims .
2	their cowardly attitude means there is only one recourse . to tell the sellers who use hermes /_herpes that they will lose sales unless they can offer delivery using a professional courier , anyone other than hermes /_herpes !
2	if enough people boycott these_cowboys then they will either go out of business or start operating like professional couriers !
2	i '_ve sold a few old_mobile to mazuma over the last few_years and their service has always been superlative .
2	easy , efficient and fast .
2	payment is received in your bank the same day .
2	i ' d recommend mazuma to anyone as a safe , trustworthy and honest buyer of old_mobiles .
2	i ordered from axminster because they keep a wide_range of keenly_priced stock and also deliver to northern_ireland .
2	delivery was fast and well_packaged .
2	highly_recommended .
2	i bought a geberit wall_mounting wc and a vanity_unit .
2	shortly_after i placed my order online i realised that i had made a mistake in the size of the frame .
2	i was able to contact the friendly staff by telephone and have it amended .
2	confirmation of the amendment was received immediately by email .
2	good communications is in my opinion paramount .
2	the company uses a national pallet delivery network for heavy and fragile goods , it means that nothing gets damaged in transit .
2	they even deliver to ireland !
2	i saved_myself a small_fortune and time by buying online .
2	i speculatively requested a quotation to deliver a bathroom_sink i was interested in on ebay to find out whether it would be worth bidding .
2	i wasn_'_t too sure what to expect but once i had submitted my request i was inundated with emails from competing couriers which drove the price down by £_00 from the original quote in the space of an_hour .
2	i was very happy with the lowest quote and the courier it was from had very good feedback from other customers .
2	i consequently bid and won the sink and it was delivered 000_miles undamaged within a few_days .
2	throughout communication with my chosen courier was excellent and the site made finalising the process straightforward .
2	on this basis i would highly_recommend this site for anyone_wishing to move large and heavy items any distance .
2	the support i receive from one . com is always fantastic .
2	most recently i installed a crm system in my web space but couldn_'_t get email to work , it only took a couple of explanation messages to one . com , first to raise the issue , second to provide additional information and as always the knowledge and helpfulness of the support staff was outstanding .
2	always pleased with the service i receive , and always impressed with the knowledge of the support staff .
2	cannot_fault the hire at all .
2	lens came the day before the hire commenced as promised .
2	all well_packed and instructions included .
2	i will_definatly be using again .
2	easy to order and delivery was promised on friday in the next 00_hours ( but not at the weekend ) - the package promptly arrived on saturday_morning !
2	collected from the sorting_office without difficulty on monday_morning .
2	giving people a chance to win what can be a huge expenditure for some people
2	very easy site to use and perhaps the most_important aspect of hostelbookers is the trust that i am being given the best value accommodation on offer at that time so no need to trawl_through loads of sites to get the best price .

2	i bought a couple of inner_tubes ( wildtrak 000x00 / 00c ) which arrived within days of ordering and was well_packaged so could fit through my letterbox .
2	very good value for money too - cheaper_than my local cycle shop !
2	great value product , great service and fast delivery .
2	thank_you .
2	this is my first order and was guided to this company by their favourable which review .
2	my order was delivered very quickly and the items were very good value .
2	i have used two so_far and both are working well and i '_m happy with the quality of the printing .
2	i '_ve had problems in the past with other compatible_cartridges as the chips are not always recognised , but these loaded fine and no issues so_far .
2	many_thanks
2	wanted replacement brushes for washer motor , got part number from manufactures web_site so able to easily find correct parts for job .
2	quick delivery good packaging .
2	video_tutorials good for basics ( my model very different set_up ) highly_recommended .
2	in fact already used again when £ 0 discount offered off next purchase .
2	tried all local outlets for what i founed out was an un usual tube size .
2	it was for under_cabinet lighting in a kitchen .
2	info on there site allowed_me to measure old bulb exactly and searching & ordering bulb was easy .
2	price was best compared to couple of other_sites i had found .
2	tube came as a twin_pack so i have a spare .
2	only bad point when deliverd box was bent and obviously bulbs would be broken .
2	took photos as i unpacked them just_incase but on phoneing downlights_direct they just sent out replacements which arrived the next_day .
2	this time packaged far better with fragile stickers on .
2	would use again & recommend
2	00 / 00 / 00
2	p . s .
2	i was looking for replacement clips for holding flurescent tube fittings ( old ones 0 broken 0 sprained so fittings kept dropping out ) after much searching it seemed they only came with the complete fittings so rang these_people up for advise and he sent me some in the post .
2	excellent service .
2	now 0_star its the little things that count
2	great price what a price
2	as above really .
2	i was nervous to even call , but the voice on the other end made me feel_comfortable and then did something really special ....
2	listened !!
2	!
2	worth picking_up the phone .
2	my wife was given the task of finding good quality tiles at a reasonable price and to my surprise that is exactly_what she did via tile hq .
2	the website was easy to navigate along with the order , delivery was prompt and they even helped_me out when i realised that i was short on the order and suggested the best delivery options !
2	i would use again and most_likely will when i tile my kitchen_floor .
2	highly_recommended !
2	this was my fifth photo_book but the first with photoworld .
2	i found the system easy to use and liked the way your work was saved to your own files giving confidence that the time_consuming work ( they all take time ) wouldn_'_t be lost .
2	having said that unlike_some competitors it doesn_'_t therefore prompt you to save periodically .
2	the choice of predefined layouts was good and i enjoyed choosing and pasting photos .
2	i would definitely use them again .
2	quality of paper was good as were the images although some of the colours weren_'_t a perfect hue ( but this may have been down to the previous editing of my imperfect shots ).
2	delivery was super_fast .
2	i bought mine on an amazon local deal so value for money was fantastic .
2	overall excellent .
2	was a bit_sceptical_about getting my order right especially measuring pupillary_distance .
2	in the end it proved to be straightforward .
2	i ordered a pair of glasses from my optician and weirdly the two ( buy one get one free ) pairs from glasses_direct arrived the same day .
2	excellent service and great glasses for the price .
2	i am_delighted .
2	have ordered from cheap_smells a couple of times .
2	very competitive_prices , quick delivery with no charge .
2	can '_t be bad .
2	i had not heard of eflorist but i am so glad i found them .
2	the flowers arrived as requested and they were beautiful .
2	thank_you so much .
2	have tried trasferwise again , got the best rate and a quickest transfer time , well_done
2	my nephew , who_lives in slovakia , has to be on gluten - free diet and it is quite expensive to get over there basic ingrediences for baking by this special_diet .
2	i have found on internet myprotein , which fortunately does european deliveries , have ordered 0 kg xanthan gum a let to deliver to slovakia .
2	the parcel has arrived in 0 working_days since placing the order .
2	we '_ve_used eflorist a couple of times now , and were delighted to be told online that our last_minute birthday_present had been delivered successfully within a few hours of placing the order .
2	they are definitely worth trying again !
2	i only send around 0 - 00 courier packets per year ( as a small business ) and in the past had an account with fedex , who were always reliable but very expensive .
2	then around a year_ago a friend_suggested i try interparcel , the first packet i sent was to a regular customer in lebanon and i was amazed that it cost half what i was used to paying .
2	since then i have sent about 00 packets this last_year , usually choosing fedex from the interparcel site , and have not had any_problems at all , apart_from one held up in customs in kazakhstan .
2	the fact it costs me less now means i can charge my customers less , which can only be good for orders .
2	my first experience with safercigs .
2	ordered 0 bottles of juice which arrived very promptly .
2	their price was good for the juice i ordered so will be using them again .
2	placed the order for a schuberth helmet and a blue mirror visor - the visor arrived in 0 days .... the helmet was noted as coming from the chichester branch .... after another 0 days there was no sign - a quick call to the customer desk and it was immediatly resolved and dispatched within an_hour .
2	so points off for forgeting to send the helmet and for me having to intervene - but happy to give 0_stars as it was very quickly dealt_with and they were genuinely apologetic .
2	its not put me off using them again ....
2	an excellent service - a brand_new model which had just been released , the bulova precisionist chronograph , and it was still 00_%_cheaper_than the high_street .
2	and delivered in less_than 00_hours from order confirmation - to aberdeen no less - aye !
2	- away up here - with delivery included !
2	plus in that time they managed to remove the 0 links which i requeasted to be removed - which meant i could slap the watch straight on my wrist and get on with the fun of wearing it .
2	this is by far the fastest delivery of an order i have ever had ...... 00 / 00
2	hi we have used staysure before and have not met with any_problems that could not be resolved , and we are using them again this year thanks .
2	i bought flexipet to try out , glad i did as my dog is loking better and has moremobility than before , although she is getting on in years , it has made me to shop again at ome point with chemist_direct , order arrived on stated day , brill service thankyou ,
2	the whole_process was so easy , the only effort was walking to my local post_office .
2	the web_site was so easy to navigate , the iphone came back as god as new , the turnaround time was quick and i was informed every_step of the way what was happening .
2	i even had 0 notifications from the po to let_me know item had been posted and that it was in the post_office ready for delivery which i have never had before .
2	well_done , a lot of big corporations could_learn a lot from you .
2	please let_me know when you take over from british_gas , i will be your first customer !
2	if i have any comment to make about ebay , it '_s that they are forever fiddling - adding new things , changing old things .
2	fine , there '_s always room for progress , but in the case of ebay most changes generally seem to be worse than the original .
2	i '_ve been with vodafone for many_years and have had no_problems at all .
2	very sound .
2	i came_across this company '_s website via_google .
2	the toner_cartridges i were after were easily located , well described and well priced so i decided to order .
2	the ordering and payment processes were straightforward and my job was done !
2	over the next few hours i received various emails_informing of confirmation of order , receipt of payment and dispatch .
2	a nice_touch was when the following_morning i received an email giving a one - hour time_slot later that day for the delivery - which arrived just 00_minutes into that timeslot .
2	the package contained products exactly as_described and they were well_packaged .
2	all in all an eshopping experience that it would be hard to better .
2	my future toner business will_definitely be going to scorpio systems .
2	my teenage_son is addicted to pizza and over the last few_months we have tried several pizzahuts in london '_s west_end .
2	firstly they lull you into_believing there '_s plenty of seats by having the visible part of the restaurant fairly quiet .
2	when you enter they then direct you , dependent on the specific " hut " either upstairs or downstairs , where you then wait in a queue for a table .
2	you then sit and wait for your order to be taken .
2	then wait for your drinks .
2	then wait for your starters .
2	then wait for your main course .
2	then wait and wait for the bill .
2	these places have nearly made me lose the will to live !
2	i complained to their head_office and got a voucher to use for another pizzahut " experience "... that one was all about waiting too .
2	there '_s lots more to complain_about with regards to the staff and the staff attitude ... to be fair , the food is reasonable for this type of place .
2	but the staff and loss of many hours of your life easily detract_from that .
2	just a great service .
2	the clothes were fantastic value and quality .
2	bought for my daughters_birthday as we couldn_'_t get it in a shop .
2	she is extremely happy .
2	i never received the goods .
2	no refund and they said it could take 0 months only if goods were returned and then they would deduct the carriage .
2	it is 0_weeks since i received only part of my order .
2	i still have not received the refund for the products they didn_'_t have .
2	mitesh soma , you should be_ashamed of yourself , taking money under_false pretences from the most vulnerable people in society , yes thats right - shame on you ......
2	i ordered the printer on friday and it arrived in north_east scotland on monday_morning along with the extra print cartridges .
2	price was also best of several websites .
2	got everything over % 00 off .
2	chrck it out !
2	always pays on time well_done tcb
2	we thought that we had a drain problem and our neighbours were having somebody look at theirs at that time .
2	we spoke with the engineer who was more than happy to add our job to his current one and proceeded to do a great job .
2	he was extremely_helpful , courteous and professional .
2	i ' d happy use them again and would recommend them to anyone
2	ordered mattress on monday_morning and delivered next_day by 0 man team . daughter is over the moon with the quality of the mattress and speed of delivery . would not_hesitate to recommend this company .
2	this was the first time i have used this company and i must_say i am very pleased with the whole_transaction . will use again .
2	great service and spot on with delivery .
2	dpd service and tracking was second to none .
2	very happy with product and value for money .
2	nice product at a good price and delivery was very quick
2	god_oplevelse .
2	levering på 0 - dagen_efter ordregivning .
2	i gave my order the 00th_march_0000 and i received the parcel the 00th_march_0000 with a weekend between .
2	it can '_t be faster .
2	day to day delivery .
2	so i can only recommend others to use simplyelectronics .
2	j . l .
2	- denmark
2	i just need basic pc with small footprint which i can run xp / apache / php / mysql on .
2	don_'_t need any frills .
2	since_discovering pc_specialist ltd i have repeated my order when an old pc ( from another supplier ) crashed .
2	ordering is straightforward on the website , delivery is probably slower_than dell but they don_'_t provide what i want .
2	i was updated by email on progress of my order and it arrived soon enough .
2	this is a back - up pc so that the business can continue when the next pc dies of old age .
2	the item arrived within a couple of days the customer service was first_class i can only recommend this company to others excellent service and fast delivery thank_you
2	best price for avon_tyres i could_find .
2	first time i have used mobile fitting .
2	alan phoned me early in morning and gave window of eta for fitting .
2	arrived within that window , was very pleasant and fitted tyres .
2	much less hassle than hanging_around in tyre shops waiting room .
2	would use again without_hesitation .
2	made the mistake of ordering from wae_+ without researching first .
2	i needed a particular motherboard to replace a faulty one that would accept my aging components .
2	this was difficult to source which may have been responsible for my lapse in not googling wae_+ before ordering .
2	ordered on 00 june for delivery by 00 june that seemed quite reasonable .
2	the 00 june came and went .
2	wae_+ website said my order was " awaiting fullfilment ".
2	it was obvious it wasn_'_t in stock so i cancelled .
2	wae_+ replied they were expecting delivery within 0 - 0 working_days and would i like to wait .
2	i confirmed my wish to cancel .
2	after 0 days i enquired where my refund was .
2	aftr 00 days i informed wae_+ if i did not receive it within the next 0 days i would be contacting my credit_card company .
2	the reply was that under their terms and conditions they had 00 days from date of cancellation to refund .
2	under the distance_selling_regulations refunds should be made as soon as possible and no later than 00 days .
2	funny that .
2	i bid my time and waited for the 00 days to expire which they duly did .
2	after 00 days i informed wae_+ that if i did not receive my refund within 0 days i would initiate a chargeback through my credit_card company .
2	after 00 days i received my refund and a very polite apologetic message giving the impression my difficulties were abnormal .
2	the forums tell a different_story .
2	the message included the following sentence : " we really do value our customers and your custom and look_forward to continuing our relationship in the near_future .".
2	frankly if wae_+ were the last woman on earth i would turn homosexual .
2	conclusions : wae_+ advertise products that are not in stock .
2	wae_+ give delivery dates for products that are not in stock .
2	wae_+ will delay refunding for as long as possible .
2	i very much suspect that if i had not paid by credit_card i would still be waiting for my refund .
2	it appears that delaying refunding as long as possible is part of their business plan .
2	- good for their cashflow .
2	do you really want to deal with this company ?
2	i was looking for suitable tyres for my car , some fitting_centres did not have what i wanted or tried to sell me what they had on the shelf .
2	black_circles had the right tyre , at a good price , and my local_garage would fit them too .
2	just about a perfect outcome , i '_m very happy with my purchase and the service i got .
2	i love talent shows .
2	why do we have to sit and listen to all the drivel and hype and be spoon fed opinions from talentless know it all judges .
2	i want to listen to the acts they should be heard .
2	so i don_'_t watch any more .
2	change the format before you kill simon cowels golden goose .
2	who do the judges think they are .
2	do they really think we are stupid enough to believe these judges know what they are talking_about .
2	i and others with no musical experience can pick the talent with a lot more creditability than these judges .
2	lets have a talent show for judges and see how far these four go .
2	if the adverts don_'_t work they won_'_t advertise .
2	then no more company and no more brainwashing .
2	how dare they interfere with my brain .
2	it is a disgrace .
2	i take great umbridge to being subjected to these awful television adverts that are only there to imprint those numbers into your brain at the exclusion of other good companies that cant_afford the advertising .
2	we were meant to have free competitive companies but this company have successfully killed of the opposition .
2	now we pay for an over priced service that should be free .
2	dreadful company to deal with .
2	poor after sales , badly written contracts designed to mislead and hide the pitfalls .
2	misleading_advertising .
2	dont_know anyone who has a good experience .
2	mine was not a good one and would never use again .
2	avoid_avoid_avoid
2	i hate the email tricks they play .
2	sending out offers of free business_cards which turn out not to be free after all .
2	scammers
2	disappointed was looking for an_alternative to ebay but this one is worse .
2	impossible to use the free with with any useful result .
2	waste of time
2	throw them in the bin not out of the car window .
2	foxes and birds get run over and killed trying to eat them .
2	better still don_'_t buy them .
2	save your money for something edible .
2	lousy service lousy food
2	not worth the bother
2	yes that '_s what the sign said on new years day at poole branch when i was taking my non working newly purchased laptop back and that is exactly_what my experience of their after sales service became .
2	wo for me and wow for them .
2	playing ping_pong with a laptop .
2	in the end i gave up trying to get them to admit it was faulty and paid for a repair elsewhere .
2	the last place you should ever shop in .
2	the laptops might look the same as you buy elsewhere but inside they are built with substandard parts .
2	beware go_elsewhere
2	no christmas spirit from them .
2	no free listings this month .
2	they now take 00_% of your money .
2	the poor that sell the poor that pay .
2	one bad customer and your reputation is ruined .
2	buyers get protection .
2	sellers get none .
2	sellers pay the fee .
2	buyers pay none .
2	sellers sell none .
2	buyers buy none .
2	ebay gets none .
2	perhaps then they will review their fee '_s
2	they used to be cheap and good value .
2	went there recently intending to fill my shopping_basket with all the items they sold cheaper_than tesco '_s .
2	not any more though .
2	came out with only 0 items and then found cheaper equivalent at tesco .
2	i was amazed as in the past you could fill your basket with gay abandon .
2	i think they are now trading on that reputation and joining the band wagon of rising supermarket prices which are catching people out because we seem to just accept that prices have gone up everywhere .
2	well they have gone up a lot at aldi and far more than the others .
2	i call this sharp_practice and have no confidence to shop there any more .
2	sainsbury '_s or tesco '_s for me from now on .
2	this site started off with very well meaning intentions but as time has_gone i feel this site is of little value now .
2	developed into a cash cow portal for martin_lewis '_s entrepreneurial ambitions .
2	the content has very little meaningful value and it is not possible to influence this by way of dialogue .
2	martin is far to busy for that .
2	searching for answers to real problems results in no practical_advice of substance .
2	fine till they lose a parcel .
2	then the nightmare begins .
2	i will never use again 0 days on live_chat getting nothing but appeasement and lies .
2	they even apologised for lying .
2	what a cheek .
2	lost out big time .
2	never again
2	as an update i have now been contacted by [_name_] by phone at parcel0go and given a full_refund .
2	she was very apologetic and i am going to use parcel0go again but definitely not hermes .
2	[_name_] said parcel0go are carrying out a full investigation and if they find the parcel as well as the refund they will send the parcel back as well .
2	this would be a good outcome and i will then remove this review and write a new review that reflects an excellent company that acts in an honourable and ethical way .
2	for any future problems that are not resolved with live_chat i would recommend mailing direct to [_private_data_] in customer_services , or speaking to her by phoning [_private_data_] this may cost 00p_per_minute .
2	used this company many_times without to much bother .
2	i got lulled into a false_sense of security .
2	now they have lost my parcel and i am out of pocket , lost a good customer got bad feedback spent 0 days so_far trying to sort_out .
2	customer_services is a complete wind up .
2	if you think hermes is bad try booking through parcel0go .
2	now that is the biggest wind up i have ever had .
2	one bad_experience with either of these companies will fill you with enough hatred to last a lifetime .
2	don_'_t think " it will not happen to me " because it will .
2	then you also will experience the nightmare and no what i mean .
2	i wish i had paid the extra and gone elsewhere .
2	don_'_t get caught out .
2	you have been_warned .
2	as an update i have now been contacted by jenny bowles by phone at parcel0go and given a full_refund .
2	she was very apologetic and i am going to use parcel0go again but definitely not hermes .
2	for any future problems that are not resolved with live_chat i would recommend mailing direct to j . bowles @ parcel0go . com in customer_services , or speaking to her by phoning 0000 0000000 this may cost 00p_per_minute .
2	cheapest i could_find for a disney , universal and sea life combo ticket .
2	plus really quick delivery about three_days
2	would highly reconmend polybags
2	delighted with offtek .
2	they delivered my extra memory so quickly and it was absolutely perfect first time .
2	their price for the product was very competitive .
2	absolutely_delighted .
2	this was a really smooth experience and i would definitely buy memory from mr . memory again .
2	congratulate you and send warm greetings - nicu pt_nicul @_yahoo . com
2	det her er fan .. smart !
2	i found diamonds_factory through a google_search and spotted a design that i liked straight_away .
2	i wasn_'_t sure at first about ordering such an expensive item online so made some independent checks on the company .
2	everything checked out so i went_ahead .
2	ordering and payment were very easy .
2	delivery was as advised and my wife_loves the ring which is exactly like the photos online .
2	yes , i ' d recommend to a friend .
2	never buy anything from merlin_cycles .
2	i bought new avid brakes and they arrived leaking brake_fluid .
2	merlin_cycles tell me that it ’_s normal , but anyone with half a clue about bikes knows that to be rubbish .
2	they also told me i ’ d have to pay to send them back , but i found it simpler to buy a service kit from elsewhere that solved the problem .
2	after_searching the web got a very competative price with a reputable_company .
2	i had a question on collection and using the web_site instigated a live_chat with one of their agents natalie who was very helpful and informed .
2	i will use them again .
2	bought a bucket hat and hoodie in the sale .
2	both are top quality items .
2	very fast delivery service too .
2	well_done .
2	will_definitely be looking on the website again .
2	good work !
2	the item i bought was selling on for anything up th 000_pounds .
2	the reason for this was that they are one of the high_demand christmas items hi -_fi tower did not cash in on this like all the others they left their price the same .
2	the units also arrived on the very day they said the would and the packaging was good
2	value , communication and delivery excellent .
2	who could ask for more !
2	my order was placed from your website for tyres to be delivered to ****.
2	having received notification today from dpd the tyres have been delivered i contacted **** to arrange fitting but they confirmed they have not received the tyres .
2	it transpires the postcode for **** on your website is wrong rm0 @@@ it should be rm0 +++ and my tyres have been delivered to an unknown location !
2	i am really very annoyed about this , i feel an immediate_refund should be made to me as i am not about to go hunting for tyres that have been wrongly delivered because the information on your website is wrong .
2	you can contact me on *******
2	i have now spoken again with the proprietor of ++++ and he has kindly been out with his satnav to see if he could locate another business the tyres may have been delivered to in the piostcode ???
2	?, the code relates to private houses !
2	quite why dpd delivered to a private house when it clarely should be going to a business is beyond me but the postcode came from your website so it is ultimately your problem to address .
2	i will now have to seek tyres from somewhere more trustworthy , please issue an immediate_refund and confirm .

2	the investigation is under way .
2	please send over a joint statement with the garage that none of you you have received the tyres .

2	this is preposterous !
2	i have told you i haven_'_t received the tyres i have also confirmed on here in writing that the fitters have not received the tyres , i can do no more !
2	i have never dealt_with a more obstructive and unhelpful outfit , this will be put under my comments for all to see .
2	the way i am being treated by tyreleader is a disgrace !
2	it is not up to me to sort_out problems you have created !
2	i repeat - i have not received my tyres , nor has your designated fitter per the ( incorrect ) details taken from your website .
2	i want an immediate_refund i am entitled to under the sale of goods_act .

2	mike ,
2	if you wanta solution to this problem , please send me over a document as requested .
2	in pdf form .
2	best regards ,
2	you know this is not possible , how can i get someone_else miles from where i live to write on and sign a piece of paper for me to then send to you ?
2	this is your error , i have paid and you are keeping my money under_false pretences
2	i will now deal with the matter through my credit_card company
2	your company and behaviour are an utter_disgrace and will be reported - my transript will be available to all .
2	i have just completed a pmp ( ec00000 ) course with added modules for man management and found the course to able to fit in with my busy_schedule rather_than the other way round .
2	normally , at college this course would take up to two years to complete but have managed to fit it in within 0 months timeframe and due to the e_- learning process was able to go back over modules that were either difficult or complex to learn so gained extra tuition time .
2	highly_recommend this company for its simple approach and clear working .
2	best price for the bosch router .
2	order processed very quickly as with the delivery .
2	will_definately_use again .
2	super_fast delivery at a very good price . this is my 0nd item from this company will_definitely use again .
2	delivery via_dpd is very efficent as they email you as regards an_hour_slot for delivery .
2	richard helped_me out on live help and answered my query .
2	i use p0g for almost all my ebay parcel deliveries .
2	the prices are great value and there is a choice of local courier collection or taking items to a local collection shop .
2	in the unlikely_event something_goes_wrong , p0g usually offer some compensation , even if the item is not normally covered_under the agreements .
2	p0g live help is friendly and accessible ; most issues can be resolved in a few minutes .
2	well recommended !
2	i also follow links for free stuff and car_hire
2	reccomended by a friend and now always use these inks
2	the company have the right ethos that the customer comes first .
2	placed a reorder for clothing for a event at silverstone , although my order was placed a bit late , didn_'_t stop workwear getting all the stops out and delivering to the circuit in time for team members to look their best in front of the cameras .
2	recommend them to potential_customers
2	easy purchase process .
2	exactly as advertised .
2	arrived precisely when the courier said it would .
2	now all i need to do is get on with the practice .
2	seems like there '_s enough to keep me going for a long time .
2	this is the second year that we '_ve_used questor .
2	it came highly_recommended and we '_ve happily not had to make a claim but it has provided peace of mind .

2	prompt .
2	did exactly_what you said you ' d do .
2	price very good
2	my shipment arrived_safely within 0 days of placing the order , which was great considering that it was the xmas_period .

2	just back from a cruise to the baltic booked following a dealchecker listing - had a great time , im_afraid i upset a few when they found out what i paid for my superior balcony cabin - less_than some paid for an inside - been a fan of dealchecker for ages - keep sending the deals of the week .

2	i just picked floraqueen from a list of florists that could deliver floral tributes to an address in brussels and fortunately it turned_out to be an extremely good choice as the service , ordering and communication was superb throughout .
2	they are the florist we will choose in future when we need one .
2	we have used fragrance_direct for many_years_now and have not been let_down once either on service or price competetiveness .
2	we are amazed at how they can deliver quality fragrance at the prices they do .
2	unfortunately it means that we have far more aftershave and perfume than we actually need !
2	just bought my second camera from this firm and as the first , excellent service , communication and speedy delivery with a great price
2	informative website , very helpful and pleasant tele - sales , plus a great product which was competitively_priced and delivered promptly to a remote_location .
2	highly_recommend to anyone .
2	my second purchase from pc_specialist and very pleased again .
2	the system i wanted at a price i could_afford .
2	promptly delivered , well_packaged and worked straight from the box .
2	would recommend to anyone .
2	had some wonderful hassle_free trips since i started_using expedia .
2	wonderful service .
2	signed_up with talk_talk over the internet for broadband and telephone on the 00 august and paid £_000 . 00 line rental up front by debit_card .
2	received a confirmation_email on the 00 august advising me the my service will be up and running within 00 days , 0 september received my september bill for zero , tried to log_onto my account on the 0 september to get an update , could not log on so rang talk_talk and spent 00_minutes trying to explain i could not log on to my account , only to told i had a credit on my account of £_000 . 00 and my account had been deactivated ?
2	asked to speak to a manager who eventually explained that talk_talk could not provide me with the service , something to do with my local exchange .
2	ok only 00 days wasted , no email from talk_talk to tell me that they could not provide the service , just please refund my £_000 . 00 back onto my debit_card , sorry_sir we cannot make debit_card refunds , will send you a cheque within 00 days .
2	so t t take my money for a service they cannot provide , give me every indication that the service will be activated within 00 days , send me a bill , but don_'_t bother to tell me they cannot provide me with the service and then expect me to wait up to another 00 days for a cheque that i have to drive 00 miles to the the bank to pay in and then wait another 0 days for it to clear , so in total tt can hold on to my money for up to 00 days , how many people are they doing this too .
2	to make_matters_worse i was told i was not forced to pay the line rental in advance , then told i could have the service if i paid for a new line , another £_00 . 00 please , i checked the possibility of this with tt sales and was told it was impossible .
2	anyway i have dug my heels in and demanded that i have my refund paid back to my debit_card , and was told by tt on the 0 september that someone from the ceo dept will contact me within five working_days .
2	would you believe it september 00 and no contact , so i call tt again put on hold again , only to be told ceo has a bit of a back log someone should be back to you within the next two_days .
2	one could be forgiven for thinking this could be a way to make a little more profit , entice potential_customers with attractive offers and discounts if they pay in advance and then hold on to the money for as long as possible if they cannot provide the service .
2	i run my own business so am used to dealing occasionally with idiots , and people that try to take_advantage , but what about all the people that get bullied into excepting excuses , and fobbed_off .
2	i await your reply talk_talk
2	big ticket and small ticket items get the same brilliant service , top_marks guys
2	great service , always super quick delivery , full_marks

2	the company ... horrid
2	ordered an item and never came told to wait 00 days before anything could happen .
2	i have a few video suites which i use but having tried this one i realized the others are lacking quite a few things like the ability to smart fit one of the major assets to me and many more thank_you great video suite highly_recommendable
2	had you not been as efficient as you are , i would have enjoyed a peaceful bank_holiday_weekend .
2	a tried and trusted method of having to wait on a delivery and at the mercy of royal_mail , sorry my dear , but what can i do ?
2	?
2	years of refusing to pay b_& q inflated_prices and buying far cheaper ( 0 0litre tins versus two locally ) and finding a cheap and prompt service has now left my plans in tatters and a bank_holiday_weekend staining decking ,,,,,,, thanks
2	i felt that the quick and slick delivery and keen_pricing was part of always_riding ' mantra ', unfortunately slow delivery of the maglia rosa book ordered , meant a late birthday_present
2	gbics answered all of my questions and even tested the gbics specifically for my application to ensure that we would not have problems .
2	delivery was on - time and gbics followed - up on my enquiries swiftly .
2	a good example to the industry .
2	roke manor research ltd
2	ordered two keys for the yale superior series of locks that a high_st retailer wanted £_00 . 00 a key for with a two_weeks turnaround .
2	lockand key charged approx_£_00 including delivery for two keys .
2	ordered sunday ; delivered tuesday , both keys work okay .
2	bargain and secure , thank_you
2	very good service .
2	arrived two_days after ordering .
2	i '_m awaiting a cartilage operation and the support is definately helping_me .
2	i '_ve just started_using parcel0go having been let_down by another major provider .
2	i had a question relating to the consignment and chatted online to sarah_hayes who provided the answers i needed immediately .
2	i will_definitely be using these_guys again .
2	bought 0 washing_machine drum paddles .
2	managed to find the correct ones from the website easily and they arrived promptly .
2	for fitting you might have to make_sure the holes are flat edged as the plastic flanges have to slide into the drum , and the , metal may have got bent during usage .
2	bought the ( wife ) an_engagement_ring 0 years_ago .
2	particularly_liked the tracking of the diamond around the world .
2	followed up with some diamond_earrings a couple of years later .
2	wife wants more - a five stone ring - and will use dg again although i couldnt find one on the website .
2	bought a hornby station terminal kit earlier this month from modelrailwayloft . pricing was very competitive , postage was free , communication was helpful and accurate and delivery was within a couple of days .
2	no ... i don_` t work for them !
2	highly_recommended .
2	bob wellsted .
2	bought a used netbook , price was excellent and was able to haggle a bit more off .
2	delivery was quick and the pictures and description accurate .
2	it arrived well_packed in a mountain of bubble_wrap .
2	a lot of people sell their netbooks like this because they are slow but that is because the manufacturers only put 0gb_memory in .
2	for a few_quid upgrade them to 0gb and they are a different thing all together .
2	a lot of people feel safer with high_street brands of ufh but the profit markup on them is outrageous !
2	as a highly qualified industrial engineer i was delighted with the quality and design of the ambient heating_mat which i appraised surpasses the popular ' shop ' brands .
2	ufh is not black magic although you would think so with what some tilers try to charge , done carefully with good components its not that hard .
2	i used a 000w / m mat in a large conservatory with 00mm of ambients insulation board underneath ( floor level was designed to take this much into account during the build ) the system makes the room fully usable all year round as the only and primary heat source .
2	the digital controller also from ambient is scheduled to heat when the room will be used automatically keeping the running cost reasonable .
2	all parts of the system were delivered by a helpful delivery driver in perfect_condition .
2	00 months on all is fine and i expect the system to gives 00 '_s of years of service .
2	only hitch was the touch_screen thermostat had an annoying beeper that could not be turned off and activated if the frost protection kicked in or the floor overshot target temperature .
2	i simply desoldered it - sorted !
2	delivered quickly , good price , easy to order
2	we needed a similar door to the ones fitted in our bovis home .
2	i had used the original for a project in the main_bedroom .
2	replacement doors are not cheap but we could not beat homestyle prices
2	easy to use website and great prices .
2	the watch i ordered arrived the next_day as promised making it a very easy purchase .
2	very recommended .
2	the ordering_process was very easy , the lens was delivered on time and was in very good condition .
2	as i '_m quite local i returned the lens myself at the end of the hire_period .
2	no_hassle at all .
2	will_definitely be using these_guys again !
2	i just want to say what a fantastic company you are .
2	over the past 0 years or so we have ordered from you a mahogany sleigh bed , dining_chairs , and delivered today a dining_table .
2	all the items have been delivered weeks ahead of schedule and the quality is amazing especially for the price .
2	would have no_hesitation in recommending you to other people .
2	thank_you for beautiful furniture and wonderful service .”
2	definitely use it again
2	very good and friendly service
2	just , 0 next_day delivery split into 0 at delivery .
2	needed additional time off to retrieve the additional delivery .
2	part of the delivery cost has_been refunded .
2	recieved our order within two_days .
2	however was very dissapointed as one of the mascarade masks was damaged , due to poor packing .
2	customer_services were helpful but still had to take the time to pack it up and send it back before getting a replacement .
2	of which im still_waiting .
2	we are looking_forward to useing your masks on our special cruise on cunard .
2	found exactly_what we wanted for our renewal of vows ceremany at christmas , for all our family ,
2	and have just got a fantastic deal on a white dinner_jacket .
2	such a great firm with all the choice and sizes to suit everyone ,
2	great brand of chair came in a matter of days delighted with them . perfect for motorhome and garden .
2	super lightweight .
2	well_worth the xl for the extra comfort .
2	highly_recommend
2	paul
2	helpful and good service
2	arrived on time , easy to order and the quality brilliant
2	easiest site to get the lowest_prices on items !
2	the site will even match and give you a lower price on items that are cheaper_elsewhere .
2	the site is easy to navigate and has the items that i wanted !
2	and there '_s tons of free stuff that they want to give to you !
2	such an awesome site !
2	this was my first experience of cyclestore .
2	i decided to use it , after doing a search for my requirements , on price and ease of using the site .
2	goods were delivered earlier that predicted , and of good quality .
2	selection , ordering and delivery first_class , just as i have come to expect from this company .
2	web_site easy to navigate and find requirements .
2	even_though i only ordered basic delivery - no extra_charge - delivery was day after dispatch , which was day after_placing order .
2	i was given a tracking no .
2	for royal_mail .
2	waste of time as i was informed by my local office that tracking only applies ro recorded or registered mail , not signed for mail .
2	the grips i ordered were everything as_described , and make a big_difference to riding comfort .
2	ordered 0 items , namely a park tools chain cleaner , a muck off cleaning tool , chain lubricant and some cycling socks .
2	unlike a lot of companies , everything was packaged together along with the compulsory packet of sweets ( which the grandkids fought over ).
2	all delivered on time with emails_notifying of dispatch , and even one from the post_office on the morning of delivery .
2	great service from wiggle as i have come to expect !
2	fonebank did not give the highest quote on line , but they did get a load of rave_reviews , unlike the other two outfits which gave higher valuations .
2	opened an account wednesday_afternoon , posted phone off thursday_morning , received confirmation of receipt email friday_afternoon and received a cheque for the full_amount on saturday_morning .
2	all very straightforward , easy process and totally reliable .
2	i will_certainly use them again and recommend them to friends .
2	my wife & i had previously ordered 0 pcs and a laptop from pc_specialist over the last 00 months .
2	their service on each_occasion was first_class , so it was natural , when looking for a high_spec system for hd movie editing , that i went back to them .
2	the web_site was very easy to use to design my own system .
2	the technician i phoned on a couple of occasions to clarify one or two things i was unsure of was very helpful , giving his explanation and advice in a simple to understand way .
2	the order was placed on line on the monday , and i was notified of progress_throughout the week , culminating in dispatch on friday the same week .
2	due to the bank_holiday , delivery was delayed until the following_tuesday , but it arrived , very well_packed , at midday .
2	since then it has_been set_up and initial_impressions are very good .
2	i am_currently compiling a short high defination movie to put it through it '_s paces , but i am confident that it will be more than man for the job !
2	this is a clearly understood website and provides a quick access to all the ferry options and prices !
2	helpful advice from o0 shop in seeking mobile_phone tariff reduction based on review of my usage history .
2	i ordered a nikon zoom_lens at a very competitive price and got a prompt deliver from slrhut .
2	i would have no_hesitation in using this company again ... also reassuring that a uk phone number is readily_available and prominently displayed on all communications .
2	well_done !
2	cheapest , had the fitting day i needed and the garage that fitted the tyres was first_class .
2	i ordered 0 tyres but they advised me i only needed the back two replaced .
2	i would have liked to review the quality of the flowers but my order never arrived the tracking_system said they were out for delivery and could arrive any time up to 0pm so wheh this all fell through i had no time to find any alternative .
2	surely a company specialising in the delivery of flowers should know the importance of meeting delivery commitments and they must have known that 0hey were going to let_me down whattever the reason was , but no one bothered to contact me and give a reason . i can only suggest if you have a special_occasion you want to celebrate with flowers chose a company that cares_about its commitments
2	very pleased with the help we received , no_problems .
2	brilliant , easy selection , pricing as good as the ' ebay lucky - dip factory ', but with the confidence of dealing_with an established supplier .
2	next_day free delivery - and the ability to pay by paypal , so i don_'_t have to give out my debit_card_details to yet another website .
2	and it worked !
2	recommended
2	it is so refreshing to find a company that delivers exactly_what it says it will do , trouble_free and seamless from_start to finish , brilliant service guys !
2	many_thanks for the swift service .
2	lenses arrived within 00 days of ordering and communications from lenson were professional and invformative
2	my wife required a new front subframe for her golf and believe it or not got the second_hand part ( in almost as new condition i might_add ) faster_than the new part could be obtained .
2	a great service run by competent people .
2	definitely my first_port of call for future car spares .
2	faultless service , its great to know you can trust an online company .
2	richard . hastings .
2	i received the package , on wednesday , posted my phone on thursday , and the payment was in my bank on friday .... superb !
2	c ' è_stato un problema con l ' oggetto spedito e mi hanno rispedito senza attendere la restituzione dell ' oggetto sbagliato .
2	servizio clienti risponde velocemente .
2	been here for a few mots now and always get a good service .
2	not a lot more to say than that except i could see that they gave good service to all there customers not just me .
2	highly_recommended .
2	halfords in slough mill street
2	booked tyres on line and found a good price .
2	chose halfords auto centre slough for the fitting , not the farnham road one as i had experienced bad service there in the past .
2	big_mistake . i thought that they were all seperate and run as a franchise service .
2	yhey are one company that i will never use again .
2	i was kept waiting even_though i was booked in for the tyres to be fitted .
2	i could see the tyres stacked in a corner of the depot .
2	they were not touched as job after job was done before mine .
2	i complained and was given the usual , they will do it next line .
2	never again will i use any halfords
2	ordered a photo_book on thursday and it was with me on tuesday , ready for my clients on wednesday .
2	the quality of print was first_class and i will be using them again in future .
2	as a professional_photographer i am always looking for a good deal for my clients and for the money i dont_think you can go_wrong with this service .
2	the software was ok for most things except for zooming in but that was no real problem .
2	and i waish that a box for the book had been included but the product was well_packaged with bubble_wrap and a decent cardboard delivery box .
2	used the website , set_up sale of phone , entered choice of payment , mine was bank_transfer , printed_off labels , took parcel to post_office , sent special delivery ,( about £ 0 ) got e_mail next_day confirming sale , within that day £_000 into my bank !
2	simples !
2	!
2	good prices and fast delivery .
2	saw this fire grate and coal saver on ray_grahams web_site for a very good price and speedy delivery , so i tried them and they are brilliant .
2	they give you a host of different size grates , i would recommend this site to everyone .
2	we '_ve just got back from a 0 week multi element trip to vancouver , two legs of which were organised and booked via marcus at dial - a flight .
2	he was fantastic , expertly juggling our flight / city hotel / car_hire requirements so we got the best deal we could for our budget - examples being to get us return premium_economy seats for near enough the same price as the airline we ' d sourced were going to charge for one way and getting us a hire car upgrade which turned_out to be very useful indeed .
2	we received a clear itinerary including terminal data well in advance and when it came to actually traveling the reality matched the program seamlessly which was fantastic .
2	over the last few_years we '_ve booked a number of trips via dial - a - flight and always had great service with no_hassle and would have no_hesitation recommending them to others .
2	regards
2	david & pat purvis
2	i recently ordered some mirflex regulator hoses and other stuff from divers_warehouse and the service i got was great .
2	the items arrived ahead of the exoected date which was a surprise and the cost was comparible with , if not cheaper that many other_outlets .
2	i would have no_hesitation in recomending them to a friend
2	very friendly service , they repaired our ps0 which required a new blueray lazer within 00_hours at a great price .
2	i wouldn_'_t hesitate recommending them .
2	you wouldn_'_t be disappointed in there service .
2	i ordered the tyres on friday and received a call from my local fiiting centre on monday_morning that the tyres had been delivered and would i like to make an appointment to have them fitted that day .

2	this company is only going one way and , unfortunately , it is receivership , so beware .
2	they informed me of progress all the way through from ordering to delivery .
2	arrived a day earlier_than scheduled ( 0 working_days ).
2	everything good so_far - extremely fast , especially the ssd , windows boots in seconds !
2	also none of the ' clutter ' pre_- installed that you get from some suppliers .
2	would definitely order from again .
2	very high_quality polythene ( beware it has an inside and an outside !)

2	durability too early to tell .
2	delivery service prompt .
2	i bought 0 solwise pl - 000av homeplugs from broadbandbuyer . co . uk in dec_0000 a few weeks_ago one of the plugs developed a fault .

2	i had no experience of pianos whatsoever , i looked on the internet for piano reviews ,
2	and found graham howards website , uk_pianos , i never expected to find so much
2	information on one site , the information provided made my mind up on which piano
2	to buy , i could have bought a piano without this advice , but i wouldn_'_t have felt i was
2	getting perhaps the right piano for my needs , for me personally , this information has_proved_invaluable , and i couldn_'_t be_happier , although i did buy my piano from
2	gear 0 music , which was also recommended from uk_pianos website .
2	all in all .
2	i thoroughly_recommend this website for information and advice ,
2	thanks graham ....
2	they provide the products we need at a very competitive price .
2	the ordering system is very easy to use and the service is prompt and efficient .
2	they have shown themselves to be very reliable .
2	we are very impressed .
2	just wanted to say that our table was delivered as promised today .
2	yet again we are very pleased indeed with both the quality of your product and also your service .
2	bit of a panic on the printer front when three toners went west on the same day , and dozy pa had not arranged replacements .
2	rang printerland and they turned_up next working day .
2	great help from the guy on the phone too , as i was about to order the wrong item .
2	i have used this company a few_times , and haven_'_t been disappointed .
2	very good quality items , and great customer service .

2	good service , prompt , good quality bars and powder .

2	found the brother_printer i wanted at about £_000 less_than pc_world ; about £_00 cheaper_than staples " matched price ".
2	ordered it online and it was delivered the next_day - as they said it would be .
2	easy , fast and cheaper .
2	had a nice follow - up email from matt in customer service - i think from a real , live person , not one of those computer - generated , auto - messages with a particularly lovely , gimmicky humanoid nickname attached to make it seem real .
2	all - in - all a nice change from many of the companies we buy from .
2	and , an added_bonus - the printer , fax , copier , scanner works well too !
2	thanks chaps .

2	bifocals ordered .
2	arrived fairly quickly ( 0_weeks ).
2	second day glasses fell_apart .
2	phoned company - no apology .
2	did not want to accept_responsibility or have returned for repair .
2	eventually agreed .
2	posted specs guaranteed delivery .
2	company claimed not arrived - despite guaranteed delivery .
2	took a further 0_weeks of constant emails / phone_calls to chase .
2	company repeatedly told me glasses had not arrived .
2	after 0_weeks , suddenly they were found !
2	so they were trying to fob me off .
2	glasses returned fixed .
2	no refund for postage .
2	no apology .
2	glasses are cheap product .
2	side pieces keep wobbling about .
2	very unsure these will last very long .
2	poor product / terrible attitude to customer service .
2	avoid this company .
2	having used boilerjuice for a number of years_now , i am completely happy with the service and have made some real , small savings in oil purchase .
2	i will_continue to regard them as my primary supplier , although when the oil tanker turns_up it is very often one of the local ones anyway , albeit at a reduced cost .
2	spent_ages trying to find a spare_part for my bosch_jigsaw , and was delighted to find it here .
2	the spare_part was well priced and arrived in a couple of days and fitted easily .

2	the users also alert members of the forum to new money saving opportunities .
2	saved me a packet on my council tax and got a refund back to 0000 !
2	i was looking for some headphones that suited both me and my wife .
2	i wanted the best hi fidelity , my wife did not want to be able to hear what i was listening to .
2	i needed to audition the headphones before purchase .
2	after a lot of hunting about on and off line , my usual dealer suggested i spoke to " devine audio ".
2	i quickly realised that these_guys have a very nice balance to the problem of online versus " bricks and mortar " retailing .
2	i had a browse of their website , made a phone_call , and was told that the brand i was looking for would be arriving soon and they would email me as soon as they were available .
2	sure_enough i got an email and i was able to try the headphones on site ( 00 miles drive ) and take some away to try with my setup .
2	i ended_up spending more than i had planned too but at a very good price .
2	fantastic customer service , lots of choice and good prices .
2	what more could i ask for ?
2	speedtester works ok , but when tweeting results , the url link to the results takes you to a page not found and the not results page .
2	this company sets the standard for shopping online .
2	end of story .
2	an other purchase .
2	again excellent .
2	great to see a company that ticks_all the boxes , even so_far as providing as easy means to provide feedback .
2	wish more companies were like this , especially the big semi state ( hello electricity ireland etc ) pity i don_'_t need memory every day !
2	submitted order online yesterday .
2	my product arrived today !
2	can '_t beat that for service !
2	will recommend firstaid0sports to all of my friends .

2	ordered money on internet got confirmation_email went to pick_up and was told they had no money ..
2	euros !
2	!
2	complete_waste of time with a bad attitude thrown in for free .

2	i was buying a bass_guitar for my son , we found the model we wanted and looked around for the best deal .
2	found a good price and delivery online but felt we would ideally like to buy from gak as we have dealt_with the brighton shop before , made an enquiry online to them and with confirmation of alternative price they matched it and despatched on next_day delivery .
2	can '_t ask for more than that .
2	thanks gak .
2	cheers .
2	product is as_described more than pleased with it
2	the correct_part in good time
2	just renewed our motor policy and negotiated a great price too .
2	your people are very helpful and knowledgeable ( and i speak as someone with 00 years experience in general insurance ).
2	very happy with the service .
2	this was my first purchase from go_electrical and i would not_hesitate to use them again .
2	we got the best price and free delivery within 0 days of ordering .
2	i liked being_able to track the delivery driver by the minute and he was bang on time .
2	fantastic service .
2	i can only praise rc_geeks as my recent experience dealing them has_been 000_% superb .
2	i ordered some lipo packs that i hoped would fit my new mcpx bl helicopter .
2	they arrived very quickly but unfortunately my hunch they would fit the helicopter was wrong .
2	so , i emailed rcg and explained the situation and was told it was absolutely fine to return them .
2	posted them back on thursday_night and by friday_lunchtime i had been refunded in full .
2	i will , without_doubt , be looking at the online store in the near_future when i inevitably need spares for something i have crashed !
2	outstanding customer service , a rare_thing these days and very refreshing to see .
2	00 months_ago i paid £_000 for a phone that is now worthless and does not work .
2	this is how it happened .
2	i bought a samsung_galaxy 0 through amazon_marketplace at end february_0000 .
2	at the time i was surprised that the supplier didn_'_t provide a vat_receipt .
2	i queried it and was fobbed with the answer that the only document available was the amazon ' final details for order ' document - which specifically states that it is not a vat_receipt .
2	amazon customer_services were little help , referring me back to the marketplace supplier every time .
2	so_far so bad , then last saturday , 0st_feb_0000 the phone developed a fault with the display .
2	i took it to my local samsung approved repair_centre to be told that the phone isn_'_t covered by the two - year samsung warranty as i had thought because it was made for the hong_kong market and the samsung centre can only repair eu models under_warranty .
2	it gets_worse , i have gadget insurance so i then called them .
2	they were sympathetic and helpful but there are two snags : firstly they don_'_t pay for repairs that ought to be covered_under_warranty .
2	secondly before entering a claim they expect to see a proof of purchase receipt with vat number and imei_number ( neither are quoted on my final details for order ).
2	i have made a request for special pleading in this case - we shall see what happens .
2	of course i also went back to amazon .
2	they insist you should first approach the vendor through amazon , which i did .
2	i had a very prompt reply to tell me that company is no_longer a marketplace vendor .
2	so , of course i e_- mailed amazon customer_services pointing_out that they have allowed a vendor onto marketplace which sold me a dodgy product with no warranty and has subsequently disappeared .
2	amazon '_s response is to wash their hands of the whole business .
2	buyer_beware
2	p . s .
2	the phone itself was fine until it developed the fault with the display .
2	sales knew the product from my description without a photo .
2	it '_s a shame that the delivery company you use delivered it to the right number wrong street .
2	it '_s never happened before in the 00 years i '_ve lived here so it was carelessness on the driver '_s behalf .
2	luckily the owner of the other house knew me and hand delivered the product .
2	easy website to navigate around .
2	simple ordering_process with everything in stock despatched quickly in excellent packaging .
2	item arrived 0 days after i ordered it ( standard delivery only paid )- well_packaged .
2	will use company again - well_done !
2	very informative with all the reviews it gives you a great sense of where you are thinking of going
2	i got this machine for a christmas_present and had it sent to a friend '_s house it arrived very early the following_morning brilliant service have used before and will use again

2	you make on line shopping a pleasure
2	up against stiff competition online but they are a fail safe organisation who have always provided me with exactly_what i need .
2	great offers of up to 00_%_off .
2	fantastic service .
2	delivery excellent .
2	ordered 0 items on two_separate dates : there were no_problems at all in the orders or delivery : ( free !)
2	and i now have high_quality mountain kit and have even saved_myself a few_quid in the process .
2	just as it should be .
2	why can '_t all companies be as good ?
2	it is not difficult is it ?
2	super speedy delivery , great service , you have made an old pair of ( expensive ) sennheisers very happy ....
2	i '_ve_used this shop for quite a few_years and always love their service !
2	my order was delivered the next_morning with the normal delivery charge .
2	fantastic !
2	i ordered my lumix tz0 digital_camera on thursday_evening and confirmation by email in a few minutes .
2	delivery was also promised in 0 - 0 working_days .
2	on tuesday i got an email_saying in will be delivered next_day with a contact link for shipping info .
2	on wednesday_morning i checked and it was scheduled for delivery between 00 : 00 and 0 :_00pm .
2	the camera arrived at about 0 : 00 .
2	the price was great and the service first_class .
2	i will buy from them again if i need more equipment .
2	a pleasure to deal with this company .
2	i really like the choice of worktops on offer here , and i got excellent service from the helpful staff at all_stages of the ordering and delivery process .
2	easy ordering and next_day delivery - excellent service !
2	the recommendation i can give is that our bed arrived last_week and i am today ordering a second bed from this company !
2	used appliances direct for the first time and found the site very easy to navigate and select from .
2	delivery was the next working day and i had expected to wait up to five days , so i was very impressed by that !
2	i would reco0mmend appliances direct and will use the company again .
2	following a complete rebranding of an inner london school , we wanted polo_shirts embroidered in a hurry and through the christmas_period .
2	clothes0order provided advice and guidance and even sent me a picture of the garments being embroidered ( which gave_me great confidence ).
2	the shirts were delivered on time and the quality and finish was superb .
2	beers of europe do exactly_what you want .
2	they put the correct beer in the right
2	packaging and give it to a courier who delivers at the first realistic opportunity .
2	ordered a polaris rucksack on sunday_evening , fed_ex dropped it off on tuesday , and all on free delivery .
2	also , very rapid e_- mail response when i queried the colour ( which was correct , it was my mistake ).
2	i bought from their ebay store .
2	the price was the best i could_find on ebay and they delivered the item quickly .
2	ordered item promptly delivered - very happy with the service
2	good website and great selection quality_merchandise and reasonable prices .
2	a good service and well made product a pleasure to sleep on would reccomend to any one .
2	great website and service , great price , fitting of tyres took a bit to long !
2	go simply consistently offer best prices and back it up with good customer_services
2	ordered and arrived as promised .
2	best rates available
2	great value laptop and arrived next_day .
2	this is my second purchase from saveonlaptops and i would reccommend them to anyone
2	i telephoned rebecca '_s watches looking for a watch for my daughters_birthday , spoke with rob .
2	what a helpful guy .
2	not only did he source the watch i wanted he also changed the dial colour to my specification free of charge and posted free also .
2	when the watch arrived presented in its rolex box i was over the moon , the watch could have been brand_new yesterday .
2	these_guys really know what they are doing with rolex '_s .
2	thanks again rob i will_definatly be back .
2	john .
2	i recently_purchased de_walt biscuit jointer ( on offer with 0000 free biscuits ).
2	item delivered within 0 days of order ( note that there is cut - off time for next_day delivery - which i missed but was given a courtesy_call to advise me of this ).
2	whilst this item on its own is slightly_cheaper on amazon , the free biscuits mean that this is the better offer saving about £_00 , and although i haven_'_t has reason to use it i imagine that the aftersales service would be way better_than amazon '_s .
2	having used the tool , i don_'_t know how i ever got by without one before now .
2	ordered several items on a wednesday_night - received them on friday_morning .
2	i have no doubt that i would have had next_day delivery if i met the cut - off time .
2	items i received were exactly as ordered , and they always have what i want in stock ( unlike_some other_websites i have used ).
2	if looking at other_sites , you may think that they are cheaper to buy from ( although we are not talking much in the way of difference ), but watch out for their delivery fees .
2	once you account for higher postage ( and lack of regular discount after initial order ), you will realise that they do not offer as good value as executive_shaving does .
2	excellent service from_start to finish ,( which was only two_days )
2	easy to follow website so you choose the corrrect hardware for your laptop , it took me less_than five_minutes to upgrade my ram and the computer works a treat , faster_than when i had it five years_ago , if only i had done it sooner .
2	thankyou very much mr_memory a +++++
2	all the gear that you stock is the best quality on the market and i would highly_recommend your company to all my global friends looking for top kit for hiking backpacking expeditions you name it 000_% is my rating thanks
2	i bought the vango tempest 000 not yet tried out but it as been inspected and very good quality and price , i also bought the trangia 00 - ul cooker and the trangia 0ltr fuel bottle . both items are excellent quality and build and i would recommend all 0 items to all new to camping
2	i will use this company again
2	very good it works well and its reliable
2	prompt service but thought the amount that was offered could have been more for the phone i sent i wont recommend this to my friends sorry £_00 , 00 for a smart phone
2	ordered 0 items ( all marked as in stock ) for the start of the season - 0_weeks_ago .
2	£_00 odd_quid .
2	after 0 days with no_indication of dispatch i called the 00000 000 000 number and chose option 0 for customer_services - was on hold , in position 0 in the queue for 00_minutes .
2	when call was answered , the computers were down and person wasn_'_t sure what the status of my order was , said they would call back ( sounding familiar ?).
2	no call back so after the bank_holiday i called again , was told there was a problem at the warehouse and was promised another call back ( didn_'_t happen ).
2	called again today and apparently there is a ' problem ' with one of the items , however the other items are due to be picked_up by hermes today ( just received email notification ) saying delivery in 0 - 0 days but could be longer ... was offered an ' upgrade ' on the problem item and said will call back with options ( 0 hours ago ).
2	on balance - i think this company is best avoided
2	i have used lastminute on many occasions but never again .
2	i booked a hotel , received the confirmation_email and turned_up at the hotel only to be told that lastminute had made an error and that there was no room available .
2	apparently there were five people in a similar_situation and i actually met one of them who had been there for three hours trying to get a resolution .
2	i then spent the next two hours either on hold or finally talking to people who did not have the seniority to help me .
2	the only alternative i was offered was a hotel around 0 miles_away - i had booked a central_london hotel because i needed to be in central_london , not to end up in wembley !
2	while i was waiting , i found a number of hotels with rooms available and at around 0 . 00pm decided to book one of them myself as lastminute had failed to find a suitable_alternative .
2	the ultimate insult came when i asked to speak to someone_who could authorise paying for the room i booked only to be asked whether it would wait_until the morning !
2	i am still chasing them for a refund - they are quick enough to take my money but it will take 0 - 00 days to return it - and i am still_waiting for the promised email about how to complain_about their appalling customer service .
2	lovely_flowers , well_presented and quickly delivered .
2	follow_up emails and texts giving progress_reports on delivery were well - written and gave the impression of a company which cares_about its customers .
2	very satisfied and will_definitely use again .
2	the price including delivery was the best that i could_find anywhere for my savage gear dropshot rod ( which i highly_recommend ).
2	i received a phone_call the day after_placing my order to say that the rod in stock was damaged but i was assured that i would receive my newly ordered rod by the end of the following week at the latest which i was still happy to wait for and i did appreciate the phone_call to let_me know .
2	the downside was that the rod didn_'_t arrive in the time that was promised and it was quite some time after when it did eventually arrive .
2	when the rod did eventually come in to stock the actually delivery side was very good as i received an email to let_me know that it would be delivered the following_day and i was given a number to check with the delivery company so that i could get a time as well .
2	overall it would have to be price that bought me back as after_reading other comments i suspect that many more_expensive items that are advertised as in stock are actually only ordered from the suppliers after receiving payment from the buyer .. maybe i '_m wrong but it seems that many other buyers have had a similar experience .
2	personally , if i was told at the start that the items would be ordered in and that it would be about a month before delivery but the price was good then i would probably still buy quite happily as i would have known from the start before ordering but to be assured of one thing and then for it not to happen rather damages my future trust .
2	never any_problems with ordering or delivery , 0 *
2	so easy to order from , everything made foolproof
2	your sales staff were helpful , they found the extra parts which i required and set_up the purchase site for me .
2	goods arrived when promised .
2	i would / will recommend to others .
2	the item arrived promptly .
2	i was given friendly , helpful assistance and everything was as expected .
2	highly_recommend this company .
2	had never bought from cex before but on seeing this box set for only ten_pounds had to give it a punt .
2	not disappointed !!
2	quick delivery and the merchandise was like new , will_definitely use again :)
2	this the second lamp i have purchased from this company and cannot_praise them enough , good value , quality_merchandise and speedy delivery .
2	lamp well_packaged and slotted in and working_perfectly .
2	arrived in faro on 0 / 00 / 00 after booking return transfer to olheo , at airport informed that the carrier would be greenbus .
2	one girl dealing_with a number of bemused and impatient travellers , eventually after an_hour we were transferred to our resort .
2	not to bad you may think , however we were issued with a telephone_number to call 00_hours before departure to arrange pick_up .
2	after approx 00 calls a girl answered and stated that they were having computer problems and would call back ( didn_'_t happen ).
2	obviously concerned i called the next_day and again after approx 00 calls i eventually spoke to a girl who said that we would be picked_up at 0000 hours the following_morning ( 0 hours before our flight and some 00_minutes from the airport ! )
2	told girl that this was not acceptable .
2	no further calls from the company no pick_up from the company at 0000 hours and as such a local taxi picked us up at 0000 hours and deposited us at the airport at 0000 without_any hassle .
2	avoid this company like the plague !!!
2	!
2	using breakeryard . com was extremely easy and i got the bits that i needed .
2	they put me in touch with a supplier who had what i wanted and who explained the condition of it in detail .
2	i didn_'_t feel that i needed a picture as somehow i felt i could trust him and fortunately i was right .
2	it was delivered the next_day and was exactly as_described .
2	the only thing i would suggest you watch is the landline phone number , it is a premium_rate so could potentially be really expensive , i suggest you use the mobile as it doesn_'_t say it '_s premium_rate so it should be standard rate .
2	honour have a vast_array of stock catering for every fantasy or fetish you can think of .
2	the prices vary aswell so there is usually something to cater for every pocket whether it '_s just a single item for a birthday or something more_expensive for extended pleasures .
2	even looking on other website you generally find they are selling honour goods .
2	honour have helped put excitement back in the bedroom for us .
2	i will be back .
2	i love gear0music service is great if i ever need anything for music gear0music is where i , ll get it
2	i ordered a pair of shoes from ebay .
2	myhermes was the courier service used , the shoes did not arrive .
2	myhermes said " our courier posted the packet through your letterbox ."
2	the shoes were packed in a box and would never fit through the letterbox !
2	this company uses casual delivery drivers .
2	hiring a ' man with a van ' is how the business is run .
2	the delivery driver clearly helped himself to my parcel .
2	unlike_other_reviewers here who have had awful service from myhermes , i am in the fortunate position of running my own pr business , i will be contacting all of the myhermes directors and will then relate my experience on every social_media and forum on the internet .
2	i also have access to news agencies across the uk .
2	myhermes have made the biggest mistake of their lives in crossing me .
2	i will not tolerate such an unacceptable , awful service .
2	______________________________________________________
2	update_: i have already contacted two of their directors and their lawyers in west_yorkshire .
2	i would advise those of you who have received shabby service to go on to the myhermes facebook account and relate your experience .
2	i have done this today .
2	i '_m awaiting payment to my account from chess_telecom .
2	calls to chess ...
2	march 00th : " you will get a refund at the end of march ."
2	april_00th : " we '_ll look into it ."
2	april 00nd : " we '_ll sort it out for you ."
2	may 0th : " you will get payment by 00th_may ."

2	june_00th : : well look into it , and you call back " - they didn_'_t !

2	), barney phillips ( wholesale channel dir ), vanessa errington - beech ( corporate relationship_manager ) and andrea murray ( operation manager ) know what '_s going on in their organisation .
2	i ’ ve just contacted the cheshire business leaders and cheshire community foundation , who were keen to hear about chess_telecom and the way they do_business .
2	the chess chief_executive , david pollock , is a founder member of these two organisations .
2	i have had a long conversation with both institutions and i have been given assurances that my complaint will be passed on to david pollock .
2	if you have a problem with chess that is not being resolved to your satisfaction then contact these two organisations .
2	believe me , the embarrassment felt by david pollock , will not only ensure that your grievance will be attended to immediately , but will lead to heads rolling at the heyes lane office .
2	a tip_: never speak to the monkey at chess , if you can get through to the organ grinder .
2	the man at the top of the organisation always gives a damn .
2	the minions don_’_t .
2	i am now going to hit every social_network site and internet forum to relate my experience with chess .
2	barney phillips ( chess wholesale channel director ) and stephen dracup ( chess managing_director ) will be contacted via_twitter .
2	they have , between them , 000 followers .
2	i have almost 0 , 000 , so i ’ ve got a head start !
2	__________________________
2	since i posted this , earlier this month , i have received several enquiries from ' would - be ' customers ' of chess_telecom .
2	the above experience with chess is only part of the abysmal service i received during the short time i was with them .
2	the phone line was down ( including internet_connection and the card payment machine ) for three_weeks in the run - up to christmas .
2	as you will understand , this time of year is always the busiest for retail_outlets .
2	chess was not the least bit interested in getting me up and running quickly .
2	i repeatedly made calls from my 0 mobile to the chess head_office .
2	they promised to call back many_times and never did .
2	each time i called i told them i was losing credit_card sales in the shop .
2	they couldn_'_t give a monkey '_s .
2	i spoke to several people at the office and always the same response - a negative one .
2	i , like others who have posted complaints here , am very suspicious of the reviews telling us what good service chess give to people .
2	by losing trade during the busiest time of the year , chess_telecom has ensured that i experienced a very difficult period in my business .
2	was i compensated by chess ?
2	of course not .
2	i would advise anyone who is thinking of becoming a chess customer to think very carefully .
2	i doubt very much that my situation was an_isolated one .
2	the lambswool waistcoat arrived promptly - i had been kept_informed with regard to order and its dispatch , which is always good .
2	when it arrived , i was delighted with the quality and the colour .
2	the sizing was generous and i have exchanged it for a smaller_size , which also was dealt_with promptly and courteously .
2	i '_m a very happy customer .
2	i have supported glhb since it opened and paul , the owner , has guided_me on all facets of homebrew .
2	i am now making some wines , mainly red , which easily excell those £ 0 and £ 0 bottles on the supermarket shelves
2	not my opinion but those of my regular b_& b guests who act as a taste panel .
2	quick delivery
2	telephoned to check specification .
2	charming and helpful man answered my questions very clearly .
2	sent order via web_site , delivered next_day .
2	wonderful .
2	only problem is my wife wants me to put the rails up this afternoon .
2	thank_you .
2	after repeatedly spending a small_fortune at high_street_opticians every three years or more , what a refreshing_change !
2	if you thought like me , on - line ophthalmic services was a no go area of nothing but potential problems , think again !
2	what therefore do you get for your custom ?
2	value for money , quality , great customer service and communication through out the process and delivery to your doorstep with in a week or so .
2	stop paying high_street rip - off prices , and just go for it !
2	good prices backed_up by a speedy and reliable delivery .
2	highly_recommended , a +++++
2	the best price around and quick delivery ..........................
2	it doesn_'_t get any better_than this !
2	£_000_quid off !!!
2	!
2	simple , straightforward insurance that guarantees peace of mind when you ' re enjoying your holiday .
2	easy to obtain and excellent value for money .
2	there are many similar internet golf outlets but justgolfonline ensures it ticks_all the right boxes and provides top_class deals at the right price with speedy service .
2	topcashback appears to have better rates than [_external_reference_].
2	however , [_external_reference_] pay our automatically which makes_life a lot simpler
2	sometimes just one word says it all - excellent !!

2	i chatted to catherine on liveperson on 00 nov at about 0pm .
2	she was really helpfull and knowedgeable about the service and seemed quite energised as well .
2	there were the occasional short delays when she was finding the info or maybe helping somebody_else , this was no problem to me .
2	to have catherine give me the choices and help sort the compensation costs intead of trawling_through the blurb was well worthwhile and she made it very easy .
2	it was even better when she offered to process the order for me , all i had to do was answer the questions and click the link to pay .
2	will follow this up with the review on collection and delivery experience in due course .
2	very helpful spot on
2	very helpful and always got what i need .
2	they are still trying to charge me for a service i have never had with them , they could not solve the problem i had and fed a line with phone and broadband into the wrong room in a shared house instead of my room , and now want to charge me for it i have never had a service from them only bills , customer service was bad very bad rude and kept passing me on to someone_else who passes you on again , rubbish company , i would never use them as long as i live .
2	very helpful at all times i have never had a problem with them ,
2	always finding a way to charge you more than original price you paid , was recently charged extra for baggage when i ask to see print out of weight on scales they refused so i had to take thier word for this , my bag was the same going with less comming_back but charged me more forced to pay i call this exstortion .
2	i always find what i want in marks & sparks love shopping in there any time

2	five big stars *****
2	what a great experience i had with ebookers for my upcoming car_hire .
2	all seems well_constructed on the website with clear and concise info . m , no gobbleydegook or confusing gotchas , and what great value for money in literally a few minutes .
2	i '_ll be back for more .. for sure !
2	thank_you ebookers !
2	:-)
2	i have been using ss for approx 0 years_now , having switched from another on - line vitamin / supplements supplier .
2	why switch .. you ask ?
2	well , simply because their quality is as good and offer better value for money and customer service and free delivery is superb !
2	i '_ve switched just about everything else as well from bank_accounts to energy and tv services , but me thinks i '_ll be sticking with " simply_supplements ".
2	simples !
2	:-)
2	this mouse was not as it appeared in the advert , it was so small .
2	the seller , however , dispatched the item immediately , and it was received in a reasonable time .
2	that was fine , but i wasn_'_t happy with the mouse .
2	the items that we have purchased from ocp are very reasonably_priced and delivered in good time after processing is complete .
2	slight_delay with item out of stock on first order , but as soon as i queried it i got an instant_response .
2	that little glitch will not affect me buying from ocp again and i have recommended them to others .
2	all in all a satisfied customer .
2	bought two samsung type slip cases for my and my sister '_s hi - grade netbooks - they were the same size - and can '_t fault this company .
2	the cases were a bargain , delivered quickly and fit for the job .
2	i was a little bemused by one customer ( off ebay as i was ) who moaned and left negative_feedback .
2	all i can say is that as hundreds of customers , including myself , were satisfied , then the complainer was just that - a sad git .
2	i ' d_happily use this company again .
2	cheers , les .
2	website easy to use , order processing efficient and fast delivery without extra_cost .
2	packaging effective , overall great shopping_experience .
2	unreservedly recommended to any man who_wants to take control of his cloths shopping back from his mother or wife ...
2	we have used many , many seo agencies over the years with charges in excess of £ 0000 . 00 per_month with little or no return on our investment .
2	click_submit have achieved more in a shorter period of time with a significantly_reduced outlay - highly_recommended .
2	used this site to check the best offers available and also check my current providers actual speed .
2	i was looking to replace the letterplates for nine properties and was advised to contact sds .
2	the letterplates are an exact_match for what we have at the moment and great value .
2	we will be using them again to replace the locks and brass_door furniture to twelve period properties in the near_future .
2	we placed an order for a selection of dolls clothing and could not believe it when they showed up the next_day .
2	outstanding service and the good were of excellent quality .
2	thank_you and i look_forward to the next time we place our order .
2	easy to use web_page great prices and fast delivery .
2	perfect british craftsmanship .
2	it gives the livingroom a perfect ambient and its so comfortable .
2	i live in germany and everybody loves it .
2	it wont be my last piece of furniture from timeless chesterfields .
2	do not !!!
2	repeat do not !!!
2	take out a contract of any kind with this company , they will rip you off and threaten you as they have me .
2	i had a 0 year contract with this shameful company which i duly completed and then asked them to unlock my iphone as it was perfectly ok and i intended to take out a sim only deal with another_provider .
2	they said they would unlock it for a charge of £_00 . 00 which i reluctantly_agreed .
2	after months of costly calls to an overseas call_centre the unlock has not been provided forcing_me to go to o0 for another contract and new iphone which is not really required at increased personal cost .
2	orange said that they have unlocked my phone which they have not and i finally got through to the ee tech department the other day who confirmed it hadn_'_t been unlocked .
2	the guy_who promised to come_back to me has also disappeared now .
2	i am now being subjected to aggressive calls to my home number from a debt_recovery company called nco threatening allsorts of recovery action over the £_00 . 00 which i have now reluctantly paid to avoid further upset to my wife and children .
2	the purpose of this review is to warn you against dealing_with ee / orange as they are dishonest , unreliable and will not_hesitate to bully you and your family should they need to .
2	disgrace of a company , they should be closed_down .
2	not only have i been lied to over unlocking my iphone_0s at the end of a 0 year contract they are now chasing me with menaces for £_00 . 00 unlocking fee service that was never provided and i still have my iphone which is locked and useless .
2	if you are considering moving to these fraudsters ...
2	don_'_t !!!!!
2	!
2	they are a disgrace .
2	just the place for getting a good deal sent out to spain .
2	all very easy - ordering online and dispatch to spain .
2	good back support and very good value .
2	super speedy great service
2	third time using digitalrev .
2	flawless service .
2	thanks
2	dan the engineer was polite , professional and knowledgeable , excellent service will recommend and use again !
2	emailed a technical_query answered in minutes no_problems
2	bought a 00 in tv .
2	no_problems reserved over the phone and held for pick_up for a few_days .
2	one query on a tech question lg cleared up in minutes
2	delivered inside the stated time .
2	t shirt excellent quality .
2	hi i used mazuma to get_rid of my old phone , i got a fair price and got argos_voucher for it it all hapend so quick .
2	i am not a computer wize grandad , but this was so simple to do and very helpfull , i would recomend this to any one wonting new tyres i will be back on next month for the rear two tyres . and the fitting_centre is just up the road from me .
2	they even give you a rebate following your confirmation .
2	can '_t be bad .
2	ordered using easy to interperet web_site at 00am friday_morning received 00am saturday_morning .
2	could not be better .
2	does the job with no_fuss .
2	breakeryard kept on looking until they found the part i wanted and then it was delivered the next_day .
2	i wrote a negative_review of a courier company , and had to provide proof of purchase which i did twice , and trustpilot reinstated my review , the whole_process took 00 days .
2	i then edited my review for the same company , adding the comment that i expected my negative_review to be challenged , which it was , so my review cannot be seen .
2	i again provided proof of purchase , on 00 th may but have had no reply from trustpilot .
2	after the first time my review was challenged the courier firm in question received 00 positive_reviews in 0 hour , which to me looked like fakes , these have since been taken down , though i have had no confirmation from trustpilot as to wether they were fake .
2	the whole system is flawed as the courier company consistently challenges negative_reviews hoping to get them removed , but never replies to customers on review sites . trustpilot are just helping them to hide negative_feedback
2	we accepted a quote for a house removal , and paid a deposit of over £_000 , our chosen courier did not contact us , when we contacted him , he said he was sorry but he had a lot on .
2	we ended_up hiring a van and doing the job ourselves , but shiply will not refund our money .
2	we have seen other reports of this happening , and also a report from the advertising_standards authority criticising this policy .
2	our house removal is still listed on shiply '_s website as succesful , but it was definitely not succesful for us
2	our delivery number was item id_0000000
2	having posted this review shiply asked trustpilot to verify that we were genuine shiply customers , which we did .
2	it is obvious that shiply are challenging all negative_reviews in the hope of having them removed .
2	shiply are happy to stand by their no refund policy , and it appears on their homepage , in faint lettering , this is in response to an asa ruling stating that this policy should be made more obvious to customers .
2	it will be interesting to see if this edited review is challenged by shiply
2	as expected shiply have challenged this review again , surely it would be better to sort problems out rather_than trying to hide them
2	if you want tickets go to skiddle the tickets they are easy to order ; print , if you have a problem , you just ring and they will sort it out .
2	all the tickets are legit i '_ve never had any problem with them
2	i ordered a pair of persol_sunglasses for going on holiday to australia .
2	as usual , i ' d left it late to place my order and was quite reluctant in placing my order with smartbuyglasses due to longer delivery times .
2	i needn_'_t have worried - glasses arrived promptly and supplier kept me up to date by email .
2	best of all , i saved a fortune compared to other website prices .
2	thanks
2	after_searching for best price for new barbour_jacket for my wife , i eventually realised all shops and sites were charging same price .
2	except , country_attire also offered free_gift with purchase .
2	so we got jacket and scarf for same cost as jacket elsewhere .
2	delivery was super_fast !
2	absolutely no_hesitation in buying from country_attire again
2	item arrived very quickly and was well_packaged .
2	price was much_lower_than anyone_else on internet for ideal guillotine .
2	this was my first purchase from a0b but certainly won_'_t be my last .
2	thanks
2	computer froze at the calandar point in the order so contacted ' live_chat ' and was led easily and clearly by operator and we processed a dozen parcels for destinations all over the globe ... now we are going out together ... no ... seriously ... it was a great service for something that i thought was going to be difficult and tricky ... well_done parcel0go ... well_done and thank_you catherine !
2	my son ordered 0 xmas gifts from fancy . com on 00 / 00 .
2	they stated all three would be delivered next_day .
2	one was delivered as promised .
2	the other two were no shows .
2	after a complaint about the 0 missing gifts fancy . com stated that the ' revised ' delivery date for the two gifts was 00th of january .
2	now , on 0th_jan , they advise that one of the gifts is out of stock and money will be refunded .
2	heaven only knows if and when the remaining gift will be delivered .
2	they have ruined our family christmas .
2	my son booked a flight with this mob , through a bunch of spanish con_artists called edreams .
2	the ticket he bought turned_out to be non - transferable and non - refundable .
2	this was not advised by edreams at time of purchase of the ticket , nor in the e_- mail they sent out .
2	called austrian airlines in the uk and got a call_centre in ukraine .
2	no way would austrian refund the ticket .
2	no way would they ( olga & zoryana ) give me the name of a contact in the uk or vienna to write to .
2	they would not even give me the name and address of their ceo .
2	( btw his_name is jaan albrecht , office park 0 , vienna0000 , austria .)
2	like most airlines that don_'_t ' get it '.
2	they think it is better to hold on to £_000 for dear life , rather_than go out of their way to help someone .
2	mustn '_t do anything to diminish the huge bonus the ceo will get next year , eh !
2	?
2	very helpful and a pleasure to deal with .
2	beds delivered exactly when they said they would be .
2	have ordered multiple items , mostly bulbs for ovens and a fridge and they have all been delivered promptly .
2	one oven bulb i ordered failed as soon as i tried it .
2	called them and they shipped a replacement immediately , no questions_asked .
2	the videos on their website are quite useful .
2	after much searching i decided on the lexmark c000dn , currently half price here .
2	i was disappointed when i had a call to say it was out of stock as i urgently_needed it next_day .
2	i declined an_alternative and later on the day of order the printer was available again and was dispatched promptly .
2	it was delivered the following_morning and i '_ve been very pleased .
2	fast communication where needed and staff were helpful .
2	i '_ll use again .
2	yodel seem good just give them a try .
2	service good product good so every thing good about tooled_- up with a name like that how could i say any different but gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
2	i purchased a dovedale solid_oak desk form the swindon_store in april this year .
2	if you order from this company you will know that you are not permitted to inspect your goods on delivery .
2	on inspection it was hard to miss the badly_damaged door .
2	i contacted ofl who promptly dispatched a repair man to refit a new door .
2	imagine my dismay when he asked me to inspect his handy work .
2	the door that was previously perfectly fitted into the frame was now some 0mm proud of the frame on the hinge side .
2	the so called carpenter said he was unable to fit it any other way due to the pre_existing screw_holes .
2	i contacted ofl who i now expected to pull out all the stops as i had been the recipient of two successive episodes of bad service from their company .
2	instead , a somewhat off had & not to sympathetic lady form customer service phoned me to say that ofl had reviewed my photographs & decided to offer me £_00 compensation .
2	i told them that £_00 will not excuse bad workmanship or bad service & ask what my options were .
2	i was told that i could return the desk for a refund & re order if i chose to .
2	i pointed_out that this option would leave me without a desk to work on until the replacement arrives .
2	i was told that was ofl procedure .
2	at this point i had a serious sense of humour failure & hung_up on the lady .
2	in the end i went for a second repair to the door that was carried_out perfectly .
2	why did the first carpenter not do the same ?
2	can i add that the swindon_store staff were sympathetic but their hands were tied by ofl procedures .
2	my impression of ofl is of a company offering good quality items but not backing them up with good quality service .
2	two new tyres for ageing car , promised between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 , arrived at 00 : 00 with pre_- arrival phone_call .
2	the offer of free fitting at home was an on - line one and was the decision clincher for me .
2	it '_s all about convenience .
2	cheerful fitter , who chatted away happily .
2	would use this servicer again without_question .
2	rarely ever a bad signal , even 0g when no 0g and none of the others have the same download_speeds that vodafone have .
2	this became_obvious last_year during the snow when i had a 0 mile walk home along a deserted unlit motorway 00cm of snow .
2	the phone was my lifeline to let my family know my progress and without it i '_m_sure the worry levels would have been off the scale .
2	i first thought of using them after_seeing the dragons_den episode featuring oliver and toby richmond and was impressed by their performance but also by the idea and the principles of the business model .
2	anyway this year i did it via the website and found this to be easy and intuitive to follow .
2	i did set_up an instant on - line chat with an advisor to clarify one or two points and found the the agent to be friendly and very helpful .
2	the service was done , the mot sorted , the washed outside and vacuum cleaned inside all picked_up from my front_door and returned later that day after confirmation of the cost .
2	i declined one or two advisories as the budget was set to the estimate and they put no pressure on me to have this done .
2	overall , friendly , helpful , professional and great value for money service .
2	i have no doubts_about using them again and recommending them to family and friends !
2	i have 0 old_phones_lying_around the house and to be honest i thought the ads were a con .
2	so i decided to get the phones priced .... and they came back with £_000 for the 0 ...... i was staggered .
2	they all worked and so i did the detail filling on - line and away they went .
2	i entered my name incorrectly on the registration form and had to email them to ensure the cheque was payable to the right person and it was done within hours of sending the email .
2	fantastic customer service and the whole_thing was a delight to use .
2	i would recommend them without_any hesitation .
2	first time i used this company .
2	really efficient service and high_quality canvas .
2	well pleased
2	tickets arrived next_day . great service
2	extremely efficient service both on the excellent website and over the phone and lightning_fast delivery .
2	the battery , well only had it a month but performing as expected .
2	no_hesitation in recommending this company for your battery needs .
2	making the purchase was easy , installation ok given parts were at the maximum extent of my ladders !
2	i upgraded my phone , the old_handset wasn_'_t wanted - so i sold it to orange_recycle .
2	they gave_me a good price , the admin was easy and the money was sent to my account quickly .
2	what more could you ask for ?
2	i bought fish_food from rocket aquatics - i '_ve_used them before .
2	it was easy to find and order what i wanted , and it was delivered quickly
2	i had been looking for this book on other_sites without_success but found it here at a good price and it was delivered quicker_than promised .
2	whenever i want anything now i always go to amazon first because i know that i will get the best price and quick delivery .
2	i was looking for a fire_blanket to use in my motor caravan and couldn_'_t think where i could get one .
2	when i looked in your product list i found exactly_what i wanted following my order it was delivered in a couple of days .
2	in future i will look at your web_page first .
2	thank_you for excellent service once again .
2	why pay your vets inflated_prices for your_pets_needs - viovet seems to stock everything we need , their prices will put a smile on your face , and they deliver the goods quickly - and their website is so easy to use .
2	highly_recommended all_round .
2	we find this company and its products first_class - and when we had a query , we sent them an email , and got a very prompt , informative and friendly reply , which answered our query fully !
2	we can highly_recommend them .
2	amazing range , descriptions are good , postage times are pretty good , but it is free !
2	use them several_times every_month , and recommend them most highly !
2	bought various items over the last few_months , good prices , quick delivery , very satisfied all_round .
2	as a low volume mobile ' phone user , the vodaphone pay as you go system works just fine for me - highly_recommended !
2	if this site doesn_'_t save you lots of money , i '_ll eat my hat !
2	and it '_s free too !
2	... ' cos you ' re going to work through a lot of them before you can get your problem_solved .
2	that '_s the only reason we went instead to the post_office , where the ' phones are answered properly and promptly !
2	still the best online card place in my opinion !
2	still use them occasionally , but always find them good on service and prices .
2	always a pleasure shopping at waitrose , and their prices just keep getting more competitive .
2	particularly like the wide aisles so it never seems overcrowded .
2	used vistaprint for years_now , very pleased with quality , service , and ease of use .
2	if you don_'_t have an apple_store near you , then pc_world is the next best thing .
2	good service , range of goods , and competitive_pricing .
2	bought loads of stuff from them over the years , and had great service .
2	good range , great prices , staff well trained , good prices on their petrol too , especially if you pay by asda credit_card !
2	use argos a lot , amazing range of goods at great prices , and find their customer reviews most helpful when choosing products - highly_recommended !
2	we have used cpc for years_now , amazing range , fast and very efficient service , and when we get the very rare problem ( which is very rare indeed !)
2	they sort it out instantly - perhaps we should have cpc running the country !
2	very good service . lots of useful advice and information on website .
2	will use again
2	very competitive price so i was , initially , a little_suspicious .
2	i did not need to be , in the event the item was delivered swiftly and the advance notification gave_me an exact time for delivery ( which was kept ).
2	all in all , i shall definitely use purewell again .
2	i must_admit that i was initially a little_suspicious of the ' competitive ' cost of this homebuyers ' report but i was pleasantly_surprised by the quality of the report , preceded_by a very helpful verbal update from the surveyor .
2	overall , i am extremely pleased .
2	couldnt_ask for more , prompt delivery just as promised
2	i was very impressed with the efficiency with which my order was handled , the purchase arriving the day i was informed and with two e_- mails tracking its progress .
2	i was particularly pleased that they use royal_mail , which makes it relatively easy to arrange a redelivery if you aren_'_t in when the package arrives , in contrast to some cheapo couriers .
2	very accurate would recommend to others
2	before placing an order ( no .
2	000000000 ) in may this year , i called there sales_team to confirm when the product would be delivered as i had read a lot of bad comments re meeting their commitments .
2	i was promised in this call that a ship was due to arrive on jayne 00rd with my products on board ready to be delivered within 0 - 0 days .. on this basis , i went_ahead and placed the order but made it clear in the order the commitment that was made .
2	i called again about 00 days ago and was assured that one of the two products was already in stock and the other was on its way and would be with them in the 00rd_june .
2	i heard_nothing since and therefore decided to call them today .
2	i am now told that the products will not be in until august at earliest .
2	you can_imagine my fury with this news especially as half the summer has already gone .
2	in this basis i decided to cancel my order and get a refund .
2	vicki has very kindle agreed to email me today once the credit has_been processed and the credit should be with me within 0 - 0 working_days .
2	please do not trust anything that anyone tells you in rattan_direct as they are clearly lying to their customers .
2	i generally take far too long comparing models , prices etc and with the laser_printer it was even worse , but eventually_settled on a lexmark and printerland , they included delivery but weren_'_t more_expensive because of it , plus they claimed a next_day delivery .
2	as it happened it did arrive the next working day which was handy as i don_'_t like staying in for days waiting for deliveries .
2	a cable i ordered wasn_'_t with it , but it wasn_'_t essential for the printer and in fairness they did send via the post so didn_'_t need to stay in for it .
2	the printer is a lexmark_x000 and works well .
2	complex drawings take a while to get the first one out , sometimes a minute or more but once started it shoots them out very quickly , perhaps all laser_printers are like this i don_'_t know , but i '_m certainly satisfied with it and hopefully it will carry on for years .
2	parts were as ordered and arrived well_packaged , easy to fit and is now up and working with the towel_rail i also got from geyser , happy with both purchases .
2	ordered parts on the tuesday , delivered on thursday , set_up and working the same day , couldn_'_t be_happier .
2	cooker ordered on the friday , delivered on the saturday , all fitted and working by dinner time :) very happy with the service .
2	web sit easy to navigate , ordering was easy , delivered on time .
2	my delivery went missing - it was the carriers fault .
2	i spoke to faisal and expressed how urgently i required the goods - he tracked it down and immediately arranged for a taxi to deliver the consignment within a couple of hours .
2	this is a rare trait in today '_s world - a company who are prepared to go that extra_mile to ensure their customer is happy - unrivalled customer service - can '_t thank faisal enough - will_certainly used them again in future .
2	having been a loyal and very good customer for over a year now , putting good volumes of business through interparcel - i was really annoyed and miffed when there was an i . t .
2	problem where there site suddenly decided it didn_'_t recognise our postcode as a collection address - having phoned interparcel and spoken to numerous people who suggested various things which didn_'_t work - nobody really seemed particularly bothered - my last dealings with this matter , a supervisor promised to phone me back to sort it out after supposedly going away to look into in more depth - they never did .
2	their loss - i am now putting all my business through another company - interparcel have lost £ 0000 '_s business through me alone - if this is the way you look after customers when things go_wrong you don_'_t deserve to be in business
2	i ordered a laptop hard_drive which was delivered well_packaged in good time .
2	i have iphone 0 locked by vodafone spain now is unlocked my satsfatipn is infinite
2	contracted ecologicliving ( carlisle ) to provide 0 seperate biomass systems ( both ' turn key ').
2	one a 00kw pellet ( one property ) and the other a 000kw wood chip system to provide hot_water and central_heating to 0 properties .
2	the 000kw project was suposed to be finished by christmas 0000 .
2	whilst we expected some minor teething_problems , we did not envisage such a delay to completion .
2	the project is now 0 months , and counting , overdue ( both projects not actually complete - 0 properties still do not have central_heating ).
2	the company showed us no detailed plans ( scale drawings rather_than schematics ), nor a project works plan ( pert / gantt chart ) and we ( the customers ) have found ourselves being resident site managers ( having to explain to workmen what is required and check the standard of work carried_out ).
2	we also have to constantly ring the company to ask for various jobs to be completed .
2	we then get promised that workmen will turn_up on a certain day and , guess_what , they don_'_t show and we get some lame_excuse .
2	this shocking service is not just a one off it happens every week .... we ask , they promise , it doesn_'_t happen !
2	last_week , for instance , i got one man for less_than half a day .
2	i am_hopeful that during this summer we might see some real progress ( i '_m holding my breath ).
2	a positive_note would be that ecologicliving do install good quality boilers .
2	advice to any potential customer would be :
2	0 . ensure you balance the stage payments in your favour .
2	financial pressure !
2	0 .
2	get a legally_binding ( set in stone ) completion date with draconian penalties for overruns .
2	0 . demand regular site meetings ( have it in the contract ).
2	will do a further update when project is actually near a satisfactory completion !
2	helpful customer service .
2	the battery i ordered arrived the next_day at the time stated .
2	i would be very content to order frome tayna_batteries again !
2	item arrived quickly and the product was of the quality expected .
2	would use this company again .
2	i needed to phone up to find inside measurement of curtain rings .
2	it turned_out i needed smaller rings , but the lady i spoke to was happy to measure the size of the ring for me .
2	the curtain rings arrived promptly and were very good quality .
2	great choice .
2	great product .
2	prompt delivery .
2	high_quality service all_round .
2	a very happy customer .
2	if you are looking at this web_site to purchase anything from them don_'_t be afraid .
2	they are and do what it say '_s on the tin .
2	pleasure to deal with .
2	highly_recommended .
2	we have used 000 electrical before , we bought a double_oven from them .
2	the service then was brilliant , so we decide to buy a gas_hob from this time .
2	from ordering to delivery the service was spot on .
2	the only thing i would do if we use them again is to see if i can opt_out of the paying to unpack , unless it is a large appliance .
2	i would have no_hesitation in recommending 000 to anybody .
2	c cuthill
2	no contact number , tracking_numbers don_'_t work , two delivery dates missed and still not in possession of the package sent on the 00th !!!
2	utter_rubbish don_'_t use
2	harrington brookes took all the pain of debt away from me and left me free to think again . a pleasure to be able to open the door and know that no one would burst inside and take my property .
2	everything was done with so much precision and expertise that the worry was taken from me and placed with them . they took all the matters in hand and did all the running around .
2	the pleasant phone manner whenever i talked to them made you feel at ease and no problem was a burden to them .
2	i would recommend them to everyone that has problems and want to get sorted quickly and expertly
2	fantastic glasses ordered and received within a couple of days , comes complete with strap and case .

2	we purchased tickets for a yankees game , did not get contacted to collect our $_000 + order .
2	no one to talk to at cheaptickets .
2	no contact email of the seller provided .
2	no tickets !
2	called the company multiple_times , but they are closed .
2	game is today .
2	not cool !
2	cheaptickets - the internet is a 00 / 0 online marketplace .
2	you are selling tickets for flights , events etc_., you need to have customer_support at all times ...
2	i have used blckcircles several_times now - l always spend time checking prices on most national_tyre company websites , but l have never found a deal better_than blackcircles yet .
2	the service is always excellent , and it is very convenient when selecting the local_fitter who blackcircles book you in with to fit the tyres .
2	found this great website for tiles etc , called ' wall & floor_tile specialists '.
2	their website is so easy to use , and when you '_ve chosen and request a delivery date , they can accommodate you to the day .
2	no more waiting for delivery , they are with you when they say .
2	found the customer service a treat to use as well .
2	i had miscalculated some tiles and requested more of the same .
2	nothing was too much_trouble & again , delivered on time .
2	half the price of leading tile companies , and i highly_recommend them .
2	i buy gifts for my wife every year from littlewoods .
2	since the shops disappeared from our town centres / high_streets i found them on the internet .
2	i will_continue to use their on - line service as we have had really good delivery and returns service from them , low costs & speedy too .
2	we highly_recommend them .
2	we recently had our house keys stolen , they were in my rucksack and our home address was also there .
2	i immediately went on line to search for replacement barrels .
2	i found ironmongery_direct and located the required barrel sizes .
2	placed my order straight_away on - line and was over the moon when the items arrived the next_day , the items were very reasonably_priced and delivery was free .
2	very easy to search the catalogue , with the knowledge that ironmongerydirect has a no_quibble_returns_policy .
2	overall a great company to shop with ........... i '_ll be back .
2	i would recommend their service
2	easy to navigate website , simple order process , product ( fridge_/_freezer ) delivered on the due date and time - slot as promised , securely_packaged , complete and is now installed without problem .
2	comprehensive and clear communication_throughout .
2	topped_off by a very competitive price .
2	the service was so speedy , and offtek website was easy to navigate , and found the exact memory item .
2	and the result is my apple_imac i0 is now loaded with 00gb_ram .
2	excellent service , will_certainly recommend offtek for speedy service and value for money !
2	go on line to order from viovet , its easy , quick and the delivery is second to non , the price is right and order over £_00 . 00 and the postage is free .
2	great service got to be 0_stars all the way .
2	many_thanks .
2	order made early pm - order received at 0000 am following_morning fitted and working for customer by 00 . 00 am .
2	can '_t beat that for service , many_thanks .
2	as a first timer with mpb , i was blown_away by the superb service recieved , got my lense just 00_hrs after ordering , very well_packaged ( can be a major concern ) condition was awesome , couldn ` t stop grinning , this company is well deserving of my praise , it `_s a pity i can only award them 0_stars , will_certainly be back guys .
2	i paid extra for two day delivery .
2	delivery took four days and the promised emails concerning date and time of delivery were not sent to me .
2	the packing note that came with the delivery implies that the paid for two day delivery had not actually been implemented .
2	the bird_box was of poor quality and had some damage .
2	an very similar item could be purchased elsewhere for a much_lower price .
2	the camera mounting_bracket will need to be removed before the camera can be fitted to the bird_box .
2	the impression is given that this is just a set of items designed and intended for other purposes being collected together and advertised as something else .
2	further to the above apparently negative_comments : an unsolicited refund of the additional postage_charges has_been received .
2	the camera has_been installed in a bird_box without too much difficulty - it was necessary to remove the mounting_bracket , mount the bracket onto the underside of the bird_box roof piece , then reattach the camera and fit the roof piece .
2	it was purchased as a birthday_present for my wife .
2	she is really delighted with it and all that is needed now are some birds !
2	i '_ve been using refresh for some while now .
2	previous_experiences of ' non - gen ' ink_cartridges have always left me disappointed and driven me back to the genuine product for my canon .
2	however , when my regular supplier closed and i was having problems finding reasonably_priced alternative i discovered refresh_cartridges and decided i ' d give their non - genuine product a try .
2	i was , and still am , not disappointed !
2	i '_ve had no trouble with their non - gen product and would recommend them to anyone who_uses their printer on a day - to - day basis for normal office type printing .
2	i even get good results printing colour photographs .
2	refresh also provide a brilliant service with an excellent delivery service .
2	they even promote cartridge re - cycling by providing special post - free envelopes so you can post off your old cartridges for re - use .
2	all in all a very efficient , fairly - priced service i would recommend to all .
2	with great customer service and great stock range , wheelspin_models is highly_recommended
2	first time ordering , great service fast delivery , will use battery_force in the future
2	i '_ve booked many hotels through expedia over the years - in uk , europe , usa & china - and it '_s always been very smooth .

2	i found the advisor very helpful and always
2	there rad eady to answer any questions i
2	had no matter_how simple .
2	she was always
2	courteous and never rushed . the advice i
2	received helped_me make up my mind .
2	and i
2	completed in four weeks .
2	i called she plays he plays regarding purchasing an item for my wife and i .
2	it had been a while since i had purchased anything like this , but being over 00 , i thought i better spice up my life - heck you only live once !
2	i liked the website as it was not tacky , dark or nasty / cheap and there was a large_selection of fun and great looking products .
2	i must_say the service was out of this world .
2	the staff were so pleasant to talk to and nothing ever felt_rushed or pressured .
2	i told them what i liked and they just suggested the pros and cons of a variety of items .
2	they let_me know via_email when my parcel had been dispatched and i was worried that it wouldn_'_t be discreet .
2	guess_what ?
2	it was super discreet ( i had to collect it from my sorting_office !)
2	and it was just a brown box .
2	once i got home my wife and i opened the box and everything was wrapped in lovely tissue_paper and there was even a free sachet of lubricant .
2	i also just want to say a big thank_you to victoria for all her help and advice .
2	i would highly_recommend this company . could not fault anything at all .
2	filter arrived today .
2	fits_perfectly , have not had a lot a time to really try it out yet , but already the car seems to be a bit more responsive .

2	no_brainer i will use again and recommend to others
2	very quick , easy and simple to follow_instructions , this transaction worked very well .
2	having bought and paid for items ... still have not received them .

2	firms you deal with are rubbish ; as is your ordering system .
2	don_` t deserve any stars and it probably wont let_me publish this
2	i have visited and purchased 0 times from glasses_direct .
2	ordering could not be more simple . put in your prescription , pick your frames and hey - ho ; new specs in a week or so . cheap prices but no less quality . brilliant .
2	love buying and selling on ebay .... you have changed the world ....
2	i love the absolute variety on youtube .... a great service .
2	excellent service from a great organisation
2	i have had nothing but good service from hotels . com , the nicest of hotels , good choice and discounts and will recommend them to everyone .

2	only contact from music city has_been to confirm that order was placed .
2	the order was placed almost 0_weeks_ago and as yet i have not received any confirmation that the order has_been processed or dispatched .
2	i am beginning to feel that this is a bogus company .
2	i understand that delivery time from u . s to u . k will be little_longer_than normal but i paid over $_00 . 00 for delivery so i am expecting better service than i already have received .
2	if i get the goods before_christmas , i may use site again , if not then no way .
2	this is a present for my wife .
2	not happy so_far .
2	0_star only coz its christmas time
2	bought 0 sun_loungers which arrived on time and are very solidly_built .
2	only had them a few_days but they are comfortable and feel like they will last a very long time .
2	i have returned to this company on several_occasions & never had a problem with them at all , products & delivery has_been first_class & i have no problem in recommending them to anyone
2	i bought some duracell_batteries from ' battery_force ' & they were really reasonable , it was like getting 0 0 0 at tesco the price was so good & to top it all i got a duracle torch for free , so now when people come around i ask them if they want to see saz '_s rabbits ears , even those who don_'_t understand what i mean are really envious .
2	go to there online shop & see what bargins they have .

2	my parcel was not delivered to the correct address and not signed for by me - my name is misspelt according to the delivery e_- mail .
2	should have been delivered to no .
2	00 ( with 00 " high numbers on white background ) but instead delivered to no .
2	00 ( very small 0 " high numbers ).
2	waited in all day for delivery expected between 00 & 0 - parcel delivered wrongly at 00 : 00 !
2	all other couriers have delivered correctly !
2	we ordered the 0 - 00 teak set complete with cushions and umbrella with miami chairs on 0 september for delivery on the 00th and paid by direct transfer ( always a bit_dubious_about this but it had worked_fine for other_reviewers ).
2	on friday 00th at 0am all furniture was delivered and was better_than_expected ( more lovely my wife said ).
2	all now looks_stunning in the garden , we wish we had ordered at the start of the summer .
2	we decided to oil with teak oil to bring out the colour and improve the waterproofing using 000ml oil on 0 chairs and the same for the table .
2	good value , service and delivery - nothing more to say is there ?
2	this was our third holiday using villaplus , the villa , like the previous one , was brilliant - just as_described if not better .
2	villaplus service has_been equally good , the addition of 0 more to join our party mid - holiday was no trouble and any_problems during our stay were sorted_out quickly and efficiently .
2	we are currently_planning a revisit to the last villa for next year as soon as booking becomes_available .

2	the sales_person quickly understood my needs , and recommended the lexmark x000dn , with an excellent price and cash_back deal .
2	so_far , i have been very impressed with the machine , which arrived the day after i placed the order .
2	i have used printerland in the past , and will_continue to use them .
2	i trawled the internet for a best price and fitting service for goodyear wrangler tyres for my volvo_xc00 .
2	blackcircles is the best by far .

2	i am impressed with the service seems incredibly that i can get my camera and two lens 0 days before an order placed on the same day with amazon bearing in mind i am in west_yorkshire and the camera was in hong_kong
2	if you think you will be supported_by a so called high_street name forget it i bought a 0d mk000 which has developed a fault they are so deliberately evasive

2	i took both my family and both sets of grand parents to portugal .

2	also good value for money .
2	started looking for a specialised hardrock se on the many websites .
2	struck up a few conversations with the shops that had the best reviews and as a result fo the communications , the service offered , and just the friendly yet professional_manner i went with mcconveycycles .
2	bike was delivered on time ... perfect .
2	now just need to get in the saddle and go .
2	the next bike will come from then as well ... wont even look_elsewhere .
2	order received in super_fast time ( 0 days ) packaging was superb although bulky to dispose of very necessary and a breath of fresh_air that some bigger suppliers would do well to follow .
2	items where in a0_condition with no damage and the price paid was fantastic , i will_definitely use this company again .
2	ordering was simply , delivery was speedy and on time .
2	build quality could have been better base was out of square i had to true it up and trim the board ends , both side_panels where build poorly with un even overhang for joints .
2	the window was very poorly built and had to be replaced .
2	although the price may seem cheep the build quality can be maintained , regardless of this i would probably purchase again .
2	i was recently commissioned to build a bespoke appliance unit requiring a door that was to be painted , kitchen_door workshop not only had the style of door to match the existing_kitchen but where able to supply just one door and of the size required .
2	on delivery i checked the packaging for damage " none found " on opening wow i just wish all manufacturers would pack there doors to kdw standard fantastic .
2	will most definately_use them again .
2	the only_downside was the delivery time was a little to long for one door .
2	all in all 00 out of 00
2	i have order items from this company before and will_continue doing so whilst there customer service levels remain at 000_%.
2	dr martins web_site , a great site and great service .

2	read other reviews they are true this unit grabs your cash then you are on your own !!!!!
2	the watchhut you are rubbish .
2	it also seems the internet site is a diff set_up than the shops so if things go_wrong the shop cannot help you !
2	if any manager from this watch_hut reading this please get a grip of your staff , or you all will be out of a job .
2	update 0rd sept just phoned covent_garden shop sending out today .
2	0 .
2	pick_up watch 0 . put in jiffy_bag 0 . take to post_office 0 . go for lie down
2	i regret giving a bad review for one mistake .
2	this company is really fantastic for the price .
2	i sell items 0 / 0kg on ebay and the price plus tracking is second to none .
2	any ebayers out there get a collect_plus account they are half what royal_mail charge , tracked and get there 0 / 00 next_day .
2	i have still not resolved the overcharging with this company , calling their phone help and u will lose the will to live .
2	great deals , excellent delivery and always a good price . highly_recommended .
2	the new chair is a big_improvement on my old chair in every way and the soft casters are well_worth the small extra_charge .
2	the chair arms align well with the desk and provide good support when using keyboard and mouse .
2	would recommend this chair to anyone .
2	feeling totally let_down by car_trawler and holiday_autos .
2	having used this company a number of times without problem , i noticed this year when booking that cartrawler appeared in the search page .
2	not thinking anything had changed i continued to book a car .
2	however the hire company chosen was not named until i paid with my credit_card .
2	big_mistake !
2	to make_sure that i was totally covered , i took out the recommended security_deposit , insurance .
2	this is with allianz ,
2	so no_worries then ….
2	another big_mistake !
2	!
2	arrived in murcia to pick_up my car from a company called dickmans , should have realised , who on earth , would name their company , dickmans !
2	their office is in a van , row three murcia_airport .
2	trying not to pre judge the situation , i put my paranoia behind me and showed my cartrawler pre_- paid voucher .
2	it was at this point that i started to feel uneasy .
2	the agent took one look at my allianz insurance_cover and laughed !
2	he would not accept this and stated that i would either have to pay £_000 deposit , directly_into his bank_account , returnable 0 to 0 days after return , or take out their own insurance at £_000 .
2	well common_sense should have told me to walk_away , but this being murcia_airport , with few facilities , i was intimidated into accepting the situation or walking .
2	another big_mistake !!
2	!
2	having paid up , stating i was not happy , an employee then took me to the car and in a whirlwind after making me sign an inspection form , made his exit .
2	no real chance to establish the cars faults , i photographed each elevation of the car and drove some 000kms to our destination , upon which we found there was no hi_viz jacket , emergency triangles or first_aid kit , which are all mandatory in spain .
2	i tried_ringing the contact number on the paperwork , but no answer from the company .
2	you ’ ve guessed it ………….
2	on return i again photographed all elevations and returned the keys to a hole in the back of the van , things were looking up , there were now 0 pallets stacked up , for customers to reach , the service window .
2	i am still_waiting for my deposit , to be returned , in the meantime i have contacted my credit_card company , who will act for me and tried to contact cartrawler through their complaints website , which allows you to upload your written complaint , but not supporting_information , although it states the info , has_been successfully updated !
2	i have always used holiday_autos in the past , but since cartrawler have been involved , i believe you have little redress , the company clearly knows there are issues with dickmans , ( see dickmans rent a car , reviews on tripadvisor ).
2	incidently , taking out the recommended extra security_deposit insurance with allianz , is a total_waste of time , because unless dickmans actually states the car is damaged allianz will not want to know , best thing to do is crash the car into their van , you should then be able to claim !!
2	!
2	its such a shame that a relatively reliable company should be let_down by the antics of cartrawler and its car_hire partners .
2	will post again if i hear_anything , positive or negative .
2	i have ordered a number of items over the past year and they were all delivered without problem within a couple of days .
2	i recently ordered a half price berghaus_jacket and my order was acknowledged_immediately and a follow_up e_- mail was received the next_day to say it had been despatched via_parcelforce .
2	four days_later , the jacket had not arrived .
2	i checked withthe parcelforce tracking service which said it should have been delivered on 00 january .
2	it was now late_afternoon on the 00 january .
2	i e_- mailed outdoor_kit to advise them and was very pleased to receive a phone_call from katy just 00_minutes later .
2	she checked and found that the item had gone_missing between parcelforcee '_s london & manchester depots .
2	she promised to call me back the following_day with more information .
2	the next_day , her colleague craig called .
2	parcelforce could not find the jacket .
2	craig apologised and offered to make an immediate_refund as the jacket was now out of stock .
2	he also mentioned that it might be returned to them within a few_days if the package had burst_open in transit .
2	we left it that he would call me back in a weeks time while we waited to see if it turned_up .
2	a couple of days_later , katy left a message to say the jacket had been returned to them , had been re - packed and would be delivered the next_day .
2	it was !
2	the jacket was great , the price brilliant and the customer service from katy & craig even better .
2	i have since ordered another berghaus_jacket which should arrive tomorrow .
2	many_thanks .
2	a top quality item at a good price and delivered very swiftly .
2	i needed to send some parcels of items sold via ebay .
2	parcel0go offered the best prices and availability .
2	i forgot to bring one of the parcels with me to work ( i work 000_miles from where i live ), so i contacted them and changed the collection location to my home address , and the date to the friday .
2	the next_day my wife told me she had changed her work from home day .
2	i didn_'_t hold out much hope of being_able to change again , not without_incurring a charge , but i got onto the live_chat system and spoke to richard_mileham , who sorted things out in just a few_seconds .
2	i am very very impressed .
2	i was a bit tentative ordering a lapierre zesty bike from france to deliver to the uk , and very concerned not to be able to pay using a credit_card , since that gives the buyer some protection .
2	i set_up an international bank_transfer ( using the post_office who gave the best deal ) and waited .
2	everything_went_smoothly and my bike arrived in perfect_condition , just needing me to attach the handlebars and front_wheel .
2	the tracking_information worked well and communication from skiperfo , despite their lack of english and my poor french , went really well
2	i have ordered several items with both print and embroidered logs .
2	i have been very pleased with all my purchases .
2	i would definatley_recomend and use this company againg
2	first time i ' d ordered from guitarguitar and i was really impressed by their service .
2	i was kept_informed of delivery , including a text_message in the morning .
2	the guitar arrived well_packed and well set_up .
2	i would definitely order from them again and would recommend them .
2	we bought 0 items and they arrived quickly , were excellent quality and actually looked better when on than in the pics 0_stars
2	needed the tyres_fitted today and thought booking onlinr would mean a wait , but rang branch before placing order to make_sure they got right tyre in stock and then rang back 0_hr after making online order so they got paperwork through and arranged to nip down straight_away - job_done - drives lot better too
2	having had a quick surf on the web for an economical way of sending a heavy package parcel0go offered assistance immediately and even_though i had the added complication of wanting to drop_off at the couriers depot myself their representative
2	( catherine ) was extremely_helpful with making this arrangement possible with a great price and incredibly straight_forward .
2	process many_thanks simon
2	i '_ve_used these_guys three_times and each time has_been a breeze to use the website and the on line chat support .
2	tom , one of their agents , sorted both my problems out with no_hassle and very courteous .
2	really pleased .

2	the item arrived sooner_than i expected and i would recommend the ease of purchase
2	can thoroughly_recommend using serenataflowers .
2	i wanted to send a combination of flowers , vase and chocolates with next_day delivery an essential part of the deal .
2	the excellent website guaranteed this and this is exactly_what happened .
2	i was also very impressed with the email_updates when the order was dispatched then safely received .
2	outstanding service !
2	i can '_t remember how many_years i '_ve dealt_with e_- buyer but i was buying bits for a 000 computer when they were cutting_edge .

2	you bet i would !
2	ordered a wig .
2	the process was easy , i was kept_updated by e_- mail so i knew all the time what was happening to my order , then it arrived earlier_than_expected .
2	well_done jokers and royal_mail . the wig is good too , it is a replacemt for one i bought a few_years_ago to play the part of edith ( allo , allo , who '_s she then ?)

2	i would definitely use this company again and recommend to others with confidence . john .
2	i '_ve recently been in a position to add to my collection of different fountain_pens and always use cult_pens .
2	their service is truly excellent and quick ; the order usually_arrives within 00_hours at the latest .
2	their range of fountain_pens is extremely wide with everything from basic pens costing_£ 0 -£ 0 up to ones costing a several_hundred_pounds .
2	the parcels are always well_protected and nothing has ever arrived damaged .
2	as soon as i '_ve saved up i will be ordering more .
2	i ordered my memory just before_midday and i received it in the post the next_morning , fitted it and presto my system was working again after a major upgrade .
2	and the memory comes with a lifetime_guarantee , i once had a stick fail and it was replaced within days without_any fuss .
2	i have had 0 previous web sites designed by various other_companies in the past , and now finally i have the one that works for me and my business .
2	very impressed with all the work that has_been done so_far and i am planning another site to be built by hot click .
2	many_thanks guys & girls ..
2	found this company whilst_researching a birthday_present request from my sister , good descriptions , easy to order , fair pricing , delivery was quick .
2	unfortunately , and through no fault of theirs it became_apparent after giving the present that the supplied product had been damaged .
2	on contacting the company , was very impressed with the way the issue was handled , retruns process was clear and easy , replacement product received very quickly , and when checked over found to be in good condition .
2	although not currently a big user of cycling products , wouldn_'_t hesitate to make this comapny a first point of call if and when i do need anything_else .
2	always pleased with my purchase from ebuyer .
2	good value for money , quality items .
2	never had an issue with items purchased , excellent customer_services and speedy delivery .
2	have always and will always recommend ebuyer .
2	keep_up the good works ebuyer .
2	the very best prices that i could_find and free next_day delivery hard to beat .
2	service was very quick , no_quibbles and i even managed to tie the bow_tie first time .
2	bow_tie '_s are now cool .
2	can '_t wait for the made to measure shirt
2	have booked several ski chalets and apartments from this site .
2	i have just found and booked a chalet in megeve through them for a large family holiday next christmas - the owner was really helpful and arranged our transfers for us from the airport .
2	chalet - hire . com is perfect for anyone looking for a place to stay in the mountains especially if in a large group !
2	i keep on getting nuisance calls from a foreign call_centre which is ran by vodafone .
2	i have never had any products through them and do not know how they got my details .
2	i have asked them to stop contacting me and remove my details from their system but they persist !
2	lovely clothes for children and women , if a little overpriced .
2	mens range is awful though .
2	i purchased their xl broadband package wanting reliable and fast internet access .
2	when watching programs on the bbc_iplayer i sometimes get a message_stating ' insufficient bandwidth ' which i was assured would not be the case .
2	very frustrating .
2	a great idea , however , every time i visit this site i never manage to find a hotel or holiday that is any cheaper_than usual ?
2	the best website for finding property in the uk bar_none .
2	00_% of the programs broadcast by itv are complete rubbish .
2	it seems as though they are attempting to dumb down the nation .
2	bbc documentaries like the attenborough series ' are far_superior to anything made by this ' broadcaster '.
2	i was trying to find a new shirt using their website and gave up after 00_minutes .
2	it is utterly rubbish .
2	luckily i was passing by a shop so could pop in - they have a good range and reasonable prices for ok quality .
2	it '_s just the website doesn_'_t seem to show all items they stock in store .
2	good package holidays , more destinations would be nice though .
2	received a card from moon pig the other day and thought to myself how impersonal it is having a typed message .
2	what is wrong with hand writing out a nice message ?
2	truly an awesome service would recommend digitalrev to everyone , great service with package tracking , package arrived within the stated time .
2	item arrived quickly and price was acceptable
2	order tok rather longer to arrive than i expected based on what was said on website .. was moved to priority after i spoke to someone on live_chat .
2	when it arrived it was well_packed and there was no damage but windows 0 would not load after several_attempts so i had to do a clean install . since then things have been fine .
2	delivered within 00_hours of ordering and best price i could_find .
2	very happy with the bosch_kettle and toaster as well !
2	fast deliver and great product for an astonishing low price .
2	i will llok out for more products to buy .
2	great site , tremendous product range and superb value for money .
2	no_hesitation in recommending this company .
2	it really is click_click and your goods are on there way .
2	if i have one small_criticism , it '_s that there seems to be conflicting advice for denture wearers when it comes to the debate on wether or no to wear them over night , possibly a bit more info on the web_site would be very useful .
2	an excellent shopping_experience , it '_s a bit hackneyed but they do exactly_what it says on the box , good value and super_fast despatch .
2	thank_you .
2	i have to say that myhermes exceeds my expectations .
2	not only are they a lot cheaper_than royal_mail for heavy items , they offer tracking with everything , and they collect from your door - how cool is that ?
2	no more frustratng queues in an unfriendly post_office .
2	our local collector is very friendly and takes time to know his customers , noting when is best to call to collect parcels and remembering your name .
2	i cannot recommend this service enough - it is brilliant and fast too .
2	fast service ; super quality ; value for money ; would recommend trophy_store to all my friends and contacts !
2	!
2	i have used glasses_direct on several_occasions and the glasses provided have been very good .
2	the service they offer is excellent and they are very responsive to additional questions and requests .
2	i will_certainly use them again in the future .
2	excellent company to deal with , very quick transaction and a fair price in the part exchange .
2	andy came all the way from nottingham to leeds to fit two new tyres on our citroen_c0 .
2	he moved the other wheels round so they were both on the front ..
2	he was courteous and efficient .
2	i shall definitely recommend grippy to family and friends .
2	pleased with everything , from on - line ordering to tyre_fitting .
2	local_garage gave_me exactly_what i ordered and did not try to sell me any extras .
2	i '_ve never had a problem with amazon .
2	i have been using amazon for a long time now (~ 00 years i think ).
2	over that time , i have only ever had two queries_regarding goods , and they were handled immediately .
2	once was when a packet which was supposed to contain two cds arrived containing only one .
2	the other was with a pair of shoes which were the wrong_size , that is different to the size ordered .
2	in both_cases , the situation was sorted_out straightaway without_any difficulty .
2	excellent job , amazon !
2	we were accused by the manager of our local_store of being shoplifters despite a total_lack of evidence .
2	when we complained to the store . experience team they told us that the store manager could expel us if she liked .
2	we disagreed with the manager '_s assertion and subsequent messages to the store . experience have vanished into the ether .
2	queries to the online waterstone '_s message board have , through the online intermediary , revealed that they have no_intention of continuing the conversation .
2	shocking !
2	i had a bosch 0v_drill driver for several_years it was a great little workhorse and i wanted another exactly the same but after much searching i came_across an ad for the drill i had been looking for i was absolutely over the moon when it arrived just the job
2	booking an airport transfer is always a bit of a worry , will the bus turn_up what will the driver be like , we need not have worried or whole transfer experience went perfectly we had a very comfortable coach and friendly helpful driver both_ways a big_thankyou to suntransfers
2	great choice of printers , best price , free next_day delivery and excellent communications ............ what more can you ask !
2	i would certainly use again and recommend to anyone .
2	just of the phone to these cretins " if wit was a sh # t , they would be a prize t # rd " , details came through for some person in my address , and a letter from bt saying that they were sorry to lose me , 00 sec call to bt sorted_out my end .
2	trying to stop mail coming through to my address a whole different kettle of fish .
2	after_speaking to cretin number " in customer service " employee of the month goes to the woman not uk_based who asked for details and then of the account .
2	i said the persons name the envelope came through with and she then said you are not this person , i said no this is my address stop sending mail here .
2	she then said on my system is down you will need to call back later .
2	i said i ain '_t calling back you write the details down and sort it when your pc is working .
2	i cannot do that i am not allowed to , i said ok let_me speak to your supervisor , i can only do that if there is a problem .
2	i said there is and its me , so let_me speak to the supervisor silence ..
2	i said hello think i had been transferred .
2	i can '_t be helping you pc not working , i said again .. look i work in customer service if i write things down that are confidential it can be shredded ... why can you not write something , do you have a pen , i can '_t be answering that question ... end of call arrrghhh ... call 00 . 00am this morning and talk_talk like i said on the phone i am busy have things to do , if i have to call you again i will charge my admin_fee of £_00 . 00 per call
2	service was brilliant .
2	we recieved our products in a few_days even_though we are in northern_ireland and the company is based in the main land uk . to recieve such a quick service was fantastic and definitely would encourage us to buy again .
2	the product was fab .
2	infact i would say the image did not do it justice it was even better when removed from the packaging and at a fantastic price too . i will_definitely be visiting the website again and advising others to do the same . we run our own small business and it is great to come_across a company we can_rely_on .
2	thankyou mugs r us ( stephen crawford )
2	easy site to use , delivered within_00hrs on a 00 hr .
2	promise .
2	e_- mailed me at every_stage of the process .
2	best price for the item i could_find , and delivered free .
2	packaging excellent
2	on both_occasions , ao delivered on time .
2	no_fuss and no bother .
2	completely courteous staff , and no_hassle .
2	need i say more ?
2	one pair for tv , one pair for the computer , quality great and i am happy to share it was bliss from first try .
2	a really good start to seeing in the new year perfectly ...
2	so i thought i would put it on here as i have read their guidelines and still can '_t understand_why it '_s been rejected .
2	i shall not waste any more of my time trying to leave what i think is a fair review of the product .
2	they need to get their act_together i think .
2	bjorn recliner_chair and footstool :
2	" we saw these in the shop and after sitting in them decided they would be great for our new tv room .
2	in the sale they were £_000 each .
2	having read the reviews it was obvious that it would need a little patience and two of us to assemble them .
2	we started with the footstool first which was a doddle .
2	then we followed the instructions for the first chair - all pretty straight_forward until it was time to fit the arms .
2	it '_s at this point that you need four hands and a little patience as lining up the holes is a bit_tricky .
2	leaving the screws loose certainly helps at this stage .
2	first chair and stool took 0 . 0 hours .
2	second chair and stool 0 hour even_though we struggled a little more with the arms on this one .
2	all in all good value at the price we paid .
2	they fit perfect , the leather is lovely and soft and they are very comfortable .
2	we watched a film last night and i almost dozed off !
2	if you are ok at putting flat_packs together you will be ok with this ."
2	our apartment is third floor and has about 00 steps and no lift .
2	aol rang to say the driver will assess the situation on arrival as they only carry up yo 00 steps .
2	the driver rang to ask if they could deliver earlier_than it was booked in for and i agreed .
2	they took the fridge_freezer the whole way and left it in the kitchen for us to unwrap .
2	nice guys and more than happy to oblige .
2	nice item .
2	good price and great service .
2	i will be buying again from aol ..
2	what a great radiator for our new kitchen .
2	works a treat and looks fantastic .
2	our plumber couldn_'_t believe the price !
2	the whole shopping_experience with trueshopping was excellent !
2	i got introduced to 00 tenants within 0 days .
2	too many to screen through and therefore i had to suspend the introduction for a few_days to screen the tenants for the viewing .
2	i will use them again .
2	what upad could add to their service is a full reference check plus a standard rental guarantee insurance .
2	first time had been aware of the ' club '.
2	was best exchange_rate on day .
2	can not fault service and regular email_updates really useful .
2	cash received within 0 days of making payment .
2	item arrived within 0 days of ordering .
2	no_problems with the item .
2	0st time i '_ve_used them but not the last .
2	nice , easy to use , web_site .
2	amazing delivery - ordered nearly midnight on tuesday arrived a 00 : 00 thursday .
2	lots of friendly e_- mails in between to keep me informed - and a lolly !
2	!
2	the ear_buds are amazing - a quantum leap in quality from my previous ones - i '_m hearing things on my favourite albums that i never knew_existed .
2	sound insulation is incredible .
2	since purchase i '_ve been on two of my daily 0 . 0 mile walks and the only external sound i '_ve heard was when an ambulance in full flight passed me a few feet away and i just heard a vague whisper of its sirens / two tones .
2	in summary a great product and a great company .
2	i will not go_anywhere_else when i next need to update any of my equipement .
2	have used expedia many_times and have always got a good deal .
2	find web_pages easy to use , will_continue to use in future .
2	i bought a complete bathroom , with everything i needed , even the unusually sized items .
2	i wanted quality but at a good price and with great service .
2	i got everything without_any fuss or problems .
2	i have no_hesitation to recommend victoria_plumb .
2	excellent service .
2	i use the web based service ( checking cheapest and best flights , booking flights , finding and booking hotels ) for my company .
2	it works first time every time and is quick and easy to use .
2	payment is easy and i quickly receive confirmation .
2	many of the hotels are in country '_s that i do not speak the local languge , so it essential to have everything fixed before i travel .
2	you want something so they sort it .
2	they check out that the part fits your make and reg and then they quote a price
2	if you like the price ( which you will ) they pay there and then
2	it arrives the next_day
2	what more could you want ?
2	simple ( s )
2	absolutely_brilliant - yes and exceptional
2	nick
2	truro
2	cornwall
2	got a really good price for my n0 service was excellent has soon has phone arrived money was in my bank_account would definatly_use again .
2	the price for caninsulin was almost_half that charged by my vet .
2	it arrived as promised the next_day in secure and cool packaging .
2	i will_definitely be using viovet again .
2	i was contacted by orange to sign up for landline and broadband .
2	i explained that i was already in a contract with another_provider for another 0 months .
2	orange said they would pay the outstanding_balance to the other company in order for me to move to orange .
2	i said i wanted to keep my number .
2	no problem was there reply .
2	simply contact your existing supplier two_weeks prior to the switch to get the existing landline ported across .
2	i did as instructed and was asked by my provider why i was moving considering i had £_000 to pay for cancelling my contract .
2	i explained orange had agreed to pay the balance .
2	my current_provider said that orange had been saying this to customers but in truth they only pay up to £_000 .
2	i had been mis_- sold the deal and contacted orange to cancel the switch .
2	orange said they would cancel the switch immediately .
2	however they didn_'_t .
2	instead they switched my landline and broadband to them anyway . they had also given me a new landline_number .
2	i contacted them immediately .
2	they told me that the girl who cancelled the instalation did not know that she had to cancel the instalation on two computers and this is why the switch had went_ahead .
2	as a result i was left without a landline or broadband for 0_weeks until orange could switch me back to my previous provider .
2	i lost my phone number and this was a major inconveience .
2	the orange customer service were rude and although i was promised phone_calls from supervisors they just didnt_bother .
2	they did however send me a cheque for £_00 after i had wrote several complaint letters to them .
2	this was pathetic considering the major inconvenience i had suffered .
2	all in all orange are liars and cheats who offer the worst customer service i have had from any mobile or telecommunications company .
2	i will never use them again .
2	great service and good back up information on the product to read before you buy
2	ordered one day , despatched the next , received on the third .
2	teriffic service .
2	placed order for 0 tyres on 00th_feb . payment taken straight_away .
2	no sensible emails received fro m company .
2	two_weeks_later get email_telling_me my fitting date was 00thfeb .
2	fitters had received nothing .
2	today 0th_march my tyres have been fitted .
2	almost one month to get my tyres .
2	fitting_centre fine and no_complaints .
2	what sort of a company takes your money and doesn_'_t have the courtesy to tell you that the tyres are not in stock .
2	tyreshoppers owes me the interest
2	on over £_000 which they " borrowed " for nearly four weeks .
2	tyreshoppers deals with problems by silence and ignoring the customer .
2	will go_elsewhere next time .
2	alans
2	best price , quality , and service .
2	as a repeat_customer i can say with no_reservations that supplement_warehouse stands_head and shoulders_above all competition i '_ve thus - far experienced online .
2	i '_ll continue purchasing my supplements here while encouraging others to do likewise .
2	supplement_warehouse rocks !
2	this is the first time i have used online vet supplies and it wont be the last . i saved £_00 on my first purchase and it was delivered faster_than i expected and it was so easy to place my prescription with them .
2	treat your feet to some toesocks from feetus !
2	they ' re awesome !
2	our bin looks great in our kitchen .
2	it was less_than half price from made . com and it '_s fantastic .
2	we actually bought two , one for our son and his girlfriend aswell and they love their bin too .
2	i ordered a replacement part for an aqualisa aquastream power_shower on a saturday and it arrived on tuesday .
2	so , shower_doc got helped to get our shower back in action in record time .
2	they keep a full range of parts , have q & a '_s to help you diagnose the fault with your shower and even have some helpful videos to help with the repair .
2	have a look here for bike stuff .
2	keen_prices and quick delivery .
2	useful website and easily placed memory order using their drop down memory .
2	placed order and it was despatched same day and arrived the next_day complete with instructions .
2	would use again
2	it was easy to use the website , the price was good and delivery was when i expected it .
2	plumbworld deliver quickly , have good prices and their communication is great .
2	i '_ll use them again .
2	the prices were good and delivery was very quick .

2	lightbulbs ordered , lightbulbs arrive - not left in the dark either .
2	very pleased .
2	this company sold me a tap that was badly manufactured and needs_replacing with one that is not faulty .
2	instead of saying sorry for your trouble here have another one that isn_'_t faulty they make it very difficult by asking you to send photos and then more photos and even more photos .
2	meanwhile days go by and i still don_'_t have a functioning bath .
2	after all that bending over_backwards they then tell you it '_s not faulty !!
2	unbelievable , i would never deal with this company again and i advise everyone to stay well away .
2	***_update **** one month later i have had a refund - yipee .
2	guess_what ?
2	the tap was faulty !!
2	such nice people but such poor customer service .
2	what amazes_me is that people read these reviews , then buy from vic plumb and then wonder_why they have problems with customer service and quality of products .
2	remember , you could be that half a person_who has a problem and not the 0 . 0 who get a great service .
2	easy to order , quick delivery , no_fuss , brilliant .
2	many_thanks
2	i am new to clothes shopping online , and nervous_about getting the right size and how exchanges and refunds might be dealt_with .
2	lots of information on the excellent website , helpful staff ( measured jackets for me ), fast exchange and no postal charge ( you do pay cost of returning something , but that is fair ).
2	a refund due to me came immediately .
2	excellent service , easy to navigate website , all in stock , prompt and complete delivery .
2	no_fuss , would definitely use again .
2	this was my second purchase from hifiheadphones and once again the service was immaculate
2	the web_site was easy to use , payment straight_forward and delivery was made as stated by excellent courier .
2	this is the second order from you and it was expedited with the same promptness as the first one .
2	i ordered buzz to arrive for the new year which it did , i ordered it around christmas time .
2	good prompt service and the cheepest price
2	just a great company to do_business with
2	first time i have dealt_with them , excellent service .
2	i placed my first order with outdoorkit on 00st_may .
2	i received an email later that day advising my order had been sent !
2	it arrived_safely 0nd june via parcel_force .
2	i should add that i reside in n_ireland and generally it takes a little_longer for delivery .
2	i was very impressed with the efficient way outdoorkit processed the order and would not_hesitate ordering again .

2	well a tale of two properties here .
2	the first was simply awful and i have an issue with the way in which the property was advertised by blue_chip , this will be followed up under another framework .
2	when blue_chip heard about our problem the moved fast ; we had two small dogs so the options for another property was low .
2	they did find us something although not in torquay but in paignton .
2	this property itself was much much_better and very clean but the area was totally different - ' bungalow land '.
2	we did get a follow - up service call from them .
2	this event did spoil our holiday .
2	first_class service , does what it says on th tin .

2	this was our first_foray into the rental market . we uploaded the details and photos on saturday_night and the house was listed on rightmove and zoopla on sunday morning .
2	we had our first request for a viewing later that morning and first viewing took place later that afternoon .
2	four more requests for viewings the next_day and second couple to view that day took it there and then .
2	loved the way that tola gave little summaries about the prospective_tenants , enabling_us to screen them before arranging a viewing .
2	even got a text from tola letting us know that viewers were running 0 minutes late .
2	credit_checks , references and contract completed very quickly indeed and our new tenants are moving in next monday , just 0 days after we uploaded the details .
2	the service provided by tola is exceptional and for the cost you would be mad to use anyone_else .
2	always excellent value for money and easy to use website .
2	use of well_known hire_companies is a big plus point .
2	would always use carhire 0000as my first point of reference
2	i didn_'_t know you had a super sleuth working there .
2	i couldn_'_t find an invoice and emma at your chat_window tracked it down in seconds .
2	most impressive and thanks .
2	i brought some glasses from glasses_direct due to a web offer but am bitterly dissapointed by this company .
2	they are much more_expensive than specsavers but offer no customer service , no personal fitting and the glasses took two_weeks to make - only after complaining_about where my glasses were did they agree to send them out .
2	they would appear to offer no benefit over some of the high_street_opticians and i would advise everyone to give they a wide_berth .
2	i am extremely surprised how uncompetitive , lackadasical and pricy they are .
2	i had an issue whereby the wrong collection address had been given , consequently it didn_'_t get collected .
2	i went on live_chat and was answered by danielle .
2	within 0 minutes she has put my mistake right and issued a new label which arrived within a few_seconds .
2	impossible to see how this could have been dealt_with any better_than it was - well_done p0go .
2	you don_'_t get that from royal_mail ( actually you don_'_t get anything from royal_mail !)
2	i have ordered quite a few things from axminster in recent months .
2	it arrives next_day , i have never been told something i wanted ' is out of stock ' and the quality is far_superior to many of the other on - line retailers selling the same types of goods .
2	always worth keeping an eye on their special_offers or ' midweek madness ' as these are by and large unbeatable .
2	i found a number of sites offering memory_upgrades all with a click - thru ' section to determine which memory pack i needed to buy .
2	the offtek site was so simple to use - it was the only one that accepted my exact laptop model number and gave_me three options .
2	it was also one of the most reasonably_priced .
2	the memory arrived in two_days and was a doddle to fit even for someone like me who has no idea of which bit inside a laptop is which .
2	i thoroughly_recommend offtek as they don_'_t automatically assume everyone is a computer_geek !
2	!
2	i have not had anything but instant and efficient response to all my orders .
2	all my goods arrived in good condition and as specified .
2	long may it last .
2	quick delivery good prices
2	an easy web_site to use .
2	with the drop down heath questions an easy form to fill in .
2	quite a range of plans available .
2	selected all clear as this was the insurance we were using via the stroke association web_site .
2	age_partnership were able to beat all the quotes that i had obtained directly from various providers .
2	they had access to a company that was able to provide the best return for my annuity .
2	once we had agreed to go_ahead the process was very quick .
2	ref_000000
2	no response when phoning to drop of car .
2	no one there to meet us .
2	had to make alternative_arrangements to park our car .
2	have tried_phoning and emails but can '_t get a response .
2	it '_s not so much the money , i just don_'_t want others to be caught out and left in the lurch .
2	you have been well warned as with other reviews ..
2	used them before and wii certainly use them again .
2	it '_s hassle_free .
2	you order online and they turn_up at your workplace or home .
2	tyres are changed , old ones taken_away .
2	exactly_what you want .
2	very good prices and no_hidden_extras .
2	got to recommend them as it '_s hassle_free and easy to use website .
2	i '_ve_used them before and will_certainly be using them again .
2	not the first time i '_ve_used them and certainly won_'_t be the last .
2	the money is in your bank_account the same day they receive your phone .
2	don_'_t look anywhere_else !
2	outstanding company , great communication , excellent product at an excellent price .
2	will_definitely use them again and without a doubt i would recommend them to you all .
2	good website , quick delivery , they keep you fully_informed .

2	who needs a gold card with your platinum service and prices .... absolutely the best
2	hungry_house has great variety and is easy to use .
2	it '_s incredibly easy to order meals .
2	the rating system means i can see what i liked when i come_back for more from someone i '_ve had meals from before .
2	simple .
2	i '_ve been buying e_- liquids from decadent_vapours since they opened their web store .
2	fantastic flavours , great prices and really helpful customer service .
2	they are a british business and well_worth buying from .
2	apart_from excellent experiences with decadent_vapours , i trust what they do and what they want to achieve .
2	great range of products , crazy prices , realy good quality stuff , easy online website and they deliver fast .
2	i have been shopping with pro - cook for a while and recomended them to all my friends and family .
2	what more can you ask for 00 / 00
2	good price , very quick delivery and absolutely no_hassle at all .
2	what '_s not too like ?
2	they have good stock , good prices and are very efficient .
2	what not to like ?
2	luke was , and continues to be first_class .
2	having sourced the perfect diamond for an_engagement_ring he worked with me to design ' something special '.
2	delivery of the ring was as promised and i was delighted with the results .
2	that '_s not the end of the story though .
2	after a few_months we had a problem with the ring going out of shape where , this was resolved quickly and efficiently .
2	unfortunately this happened a couple of times and whilst none of us managed to identify the root cause ( i assured luke my fiancee does not build extensions ) he and his_team went the extra_mile to ensure the problem was resolved .
2	the ring has_been completely re - manufactured where luke even managed incorporate some suggestions from my fiancee .
2	no doubt luke and him team are ' out of pocket ' but , i am pleased to say , customer_satisfaction was obviously top of their list .
2	i cannot think of a better recommendation that that of a company that goes the extra_mile ( and beyond ) to resolve any_issues .
2	spending this much on worktops on line is a ways going to be stressful .
2	making_sure the measurements are correct .
2	measuring and remeasuring .
2	worktop_express are a great company .
2	not only is the web_site easy to understand but easy to use .
2	the assistance over the phone is reassuring .
2	goods arrived as advised packaged as_described .
2	all parts in perfect_condition .
2	fitting .
2	we has odd shaped wall .
2	nothing square .
2	all fabrication immaculate , all measurements perfect .
2	it went together in one go .
2	perfect .
2	well_done and thanks for your great service , attention to detail and assist .
2	excellent web_site
2	not having to worry_about being screwed by prices .
2	knowing that im going to get the same product for the best price .
2	thank_you !
2	easy site to use , great to do_business with
2	i was really impressed with the guidance and support through the process of registering my trademark .
2	i knew very little about the process but my experience with trademarkdirect . co . uk was excellent .
2	responses were delivered promptly and communication was very clear .
2	i would have no_hesitation in recommending the service or using it again in the future ( e . g .
2	new registrations or extending the existing one to new areas .)
2	the certificate has come through and things are moving_forward very well .
2	the original 0gb_memory kit sent by mr_memory didn_'_t work properly in my computer , though each 0gb_module worked ok . mr_memory took it back immediately and sent another set that might better suit the chip set in my machine .
2	job_done and computer now working much_faster .
2	very pleased with their customer service .
2	my cat '_s pills were a very good price and arrived quickly .
2	will_definitely use viovet again .
2	after doing price comparison on parts that i have needed i found that aria were the best including delivery being very prompt .
2	i am very happy with all transactions , especially the delivery aspects !
2	thank_you very much aria for your support as well .
2	i would just like top add to the many positive_comments about flightstore service .
2	the products i bought ( software ) is the same wherever purchased , what makes flightstore outstanding is their communication and speed of dispatch , the price was pretty good too :-) .
2	i am a repeat_customer and intend to continue to be ..
2	i ordered a piece of software from proviation that was , and still is , advertised on their website as " in - stock " .
2	my money was taken swiftly taken and then ....... nothing ................ until i added myself to a lengthy list of dissatisfied_customers on a forum that cannot be named ; and then made a " one - last - try " attempt to contact them via the live_chat on their website .
2	now for the first time in over 0_weeks i have had a response !!!
2	.
2	my previous multiple emails , telephone inquiries and even live - chats have been completely_ignored , now i am assured that my goods have been dispatched ( to a " blank " post_code ) so only time will tell if the goods will turn_up .
2	btw i did cancel my order and ask for a refund , but it appears that that request was ignored along with all the other queries .
2	never again :-(
2	it would appear that a refund is in process ( awaiting confirmation ) .
2	a " reply " from the advertiser of the goods i wanted stated words to the effect that i was contacted and to confirm this , they also stated they were sending me a copy of the email that they claimed to have sent ; not a great surprise to note that nothing was received in either case .
2	pp disputes need to be raised withing 00 days so that is the path i took .
2	i would suggest that any would be purchaser does a thorough_search around the internet and i would add further that they might inquire why so many reviews are taken down so quickly for spurious reasons .
2	a company that seems to spend most of its time defending itself from negative_feedback has more problems that it cares to admit to in public .
2	easy to pick your perfect system from their website .
2	the value is great and once the order goes in you are kept up to date as the system is built and tested and then dispatched .
2	i paid extra for the " 0 day " ?
2	service and they beat that .
2	one thing to watch out for is physical dimensions of the case ; i ordered the dragon rider case , no_problems with the case it is a beaut , loads of space inside , but i did have top spend a few hours " being a carpenter " to get it to fit into the desk system in the study :-).
2	if i had checked the size earlier i might have been better prepared and therefore had my new machine up and running a few hours earlier , but when i eventually got around to running it i was pleased to see no " added bloatware " had been tucked_away , just the stuff i had asked for .
2	i would heartily_recommend pcspecialist to anyone looking to get a bespoke pc system at a fair price , overclocked and with a warranty what '_s not to like ?

2	ordered my exchange and all went to plan !
2	no catches just a smooth_transaction all the way .

2	they delt_with the order speedily and delivered within a one hour_slot as promised . the helmet was in stock and competitively_priced .
2	this is the way to operate and will get my custom again .
2	having ordered a triple_pack of martin acoustic_strings which the web_site stated were due back in stock 0 - 0 days , i was amazed to receive my order the following_day .
2	strings_direct had sent 0 separate sets instead of a triple_pack at no increase in price . outstanding service , which more were like you .
2	excellent service .
2	ordered a fender super champ x0 head which was in stock and the following_day it was delivered at lunch time .
2	well_done !
2	i shall shop_here again .
2	first_class service yet again .
2	item advertised on the web_site was in stock , the delivery was very quick and the price paid was competitive .
2	really have nothing but praise for this company !
2	excellent service and ink prices .
2	consumables delivered promptly .
2	best price for workforce pro ink i could_find .
2	i like the web_pages which are extremely informative and well_laid_out .
2	my order was dealt_with efficiently and i was kept_informed_throughout .
2	apart_from this i found the prices extremely competitive .
2	full_marks , keep it up .

2	yesterday i used curry '_s / pc_world web_site to reserve a tom_tom 00 sat_nav for collection from my nearest curry '_s outlet where it was shown as in stock .
2	i duly received an email with a collection reference_number to collect and pay for my item .
2	on arrival at the store i was kept waiting 00_minutes whilst staff searched for my sat_nav only to be told eventually that they hadn_'_t got any after all !
2	so valuable time and petrol wasted in a fruitless and frustrating episode .
2	not to be deterred i checked online availability at another branch and again the item was in stock and it allowed_me to reserve it for in - store collection .
2	i duly received the confirmation order with my collection reference advising me to collect .
2	this time as i was literally walking out of the front_door to collect the telephone rang and it was the branch saying don_'_t bother coming we haven_'_t got any !
2	!
2	what terrible service this represents - customers booking online for later collection must have an assurance that the goods actually exist .
2	i shall not deal with curry '_s / pc_world again .
2	got the same sat_nav same price free delivery off amazon , don_'_t waste your time i won_'_t again .
2	best value i have found - highly_recommended
2	no_problems .........
2	background :
2	0 windows incorrectly measured by surveyor ( one too big and one too small ).
2	photographs were taken of the large_gap .
2	we stated we would withhold the cost of one window until rectified ( legal right ).
2	this resulted_in threats by 0 of the directors of supaglazing , where they both stated they would remove all the newly fitted windows and threatened the 0 nice / competent fitters with the sack .
2	0 other snagging problems have been fixed , but the tone of gary left on the phone at the “ eleventh_hour ” was unacceptable ( recorded on answerphone ).
2	supaglazing were emailed with a detailed list 0_weeks before he finally phoned us .
2	further installation problems – still not fixed despite many email – we contacted cab and trading_standards who have documented details of the issues .
2	internal plastic moldings are becoming loose on many windows on this installation .
2	this as affected my decoration that will have to be done again . kitchen window left hand top hinge faulty ( gap of 0 . 0mm towards the top ).
2	i hope this is not due to being measured incorrectly by the surveyor , that subsequently had to be cut down to fit the existing hole !!
2	holes and uneven silicone application to bedroom 0 sill , needs to be removed and applied correctly .
2	we still_await the guarantee certificate and fensa documents for our the installation completed in august .
2	i had to contact fensa myself , it was disclosed supaglazing had forgot to submit the request to fensa !
2	!
2	conclusion_:
2	we were going to have a conservatory made by supaglazing , thankfully we did not sign the dotted_line .
2	ordered a present 0_weeks before_xmas , pcw sent wrong item .
2	had to wait for wrong item to be returned to pcw before they would despatch the correct item .

2	this should be interesting as its about a 00hr flight to here .
2	will my parcels arrive before_xmas ?
2	well they ' d better .
2	site stated dispatched in 00hrs and items were in stock ?
2	so why post six days_later for next_day delivery ?.
2	if you '_ve ordered and been given 00hr dispatch then make your own mind up , mine could be delivered tomorrow but i think that '_s pushing it a bit even for santa .
2	very quick delivery and a fair price , shame they don_'_t retail the larger_sizes as they do in the us .
2	one of the best that suits my pallet and what a great name to boot .

2	what can i say ?
2	having complained on this site about the poor service , i got an immediate_response from first_utility .
2	they sorted eveything out , apologised for the lack of communication and offered me £_00 for all the trouble they had caused me .
2	i can '_t praise them enough for sorting it so quickly .
2	well_done .
2	fast and easy service - lived the sweeties included .
2	this was my first time ordering something as personal and important as prescription_glasses from an internet company .
2	i didn_'_t need to worry !
2	the website was easy to use and made selections from it straightforward and the cost was very good .
2	the company were in touch and fulfilled all the necessary discussions they needed to ensure my glasses were exactly_what i wanted .
2	they arrived this morning and they are great .
2	well_done glasses_direct !
2	i was very concerned_about having laser_treatment in general and spent a great deal of time looking into this and putting it off .
2	when it was done , my worries were groundless and i cannot say how much i am_glad i had it done and how much of a difference it has made .
2	no more to lots of different glasses .
2	now many_years down the line and still am amazed at how clear my site is .
2	i had been a canon / digitel river on line customer for many_years but was increasingly getting frustrated and fed_up with their lack of service .
2	i found printerland a breath of helpful fresh_air , their prices very competative and they met their delivery promises .
2	i needed to replace my all in one printer fast .
2	the staff helped_me find the latest current version to replace my broken one plus a stock of inks which they delivered , as promised , the next_morning and leaving the package where special instructions required .

2	saw a selection pack through a voucher site for half price so thought i would give westin_gourmet a try .
2	the pack contain various beef steaks , whole chicken , burgers , sausages , beef_mince and a beef joint .
2	having tried the steaks , burgers and mince i have to say they are all excellent very high_quality .
2	the steaks were amongst the best i have ever had .
2	i look_forward to trying the rest of the pack .
2	tried to buy a tv , recieved conformation of order and then nothing , no reply to emails and phone no is to an orange answer service to whitch no - one replies .
2	after 00 days i have not got a single reply , all i want is to know whats_going on . looks_like i will have to cancel my credit_card just to stop the transaction .
2	they may be cheap but its not worth the hassle .
2	everything is done online , just a few original forms to email them and they do the rest , sit_back wait a few_months and wait for the result of your claim .
2	be warned the legal process does take time .
2	order came two_days_later
2	made my order on friday late_afternoon and expected the memory ordered not to arrive until after the weekend , but here it is first thing saturday_morning .

2	i had recently_purchased sewing_machine from argos , came 00 . 00 sent it back 00 . 00 .
2	i looked online for sewing_machine came_across sewing_machines direct .
2	they delivered within two_days and the free_gifts of cotton and scissors were a bonus .
2	would highly_recommend them to anybody_wishing to buy sewing_machine .
2	the machine was of excellent quality .
2	my border_collie has just had a big operation and this was recommended to me as he had two open wounds .
2	stitching had been under too much tension and ripped apart at two points which inevitably also became infected .
2	the manuka was suggested .
2	wound is now still open and red but can see improvement every day .
2	service provided very good
2	speedy delivery and excellent value for money .
2	a much wider_choice than the high_street .
2	i once ordered the wrong_size but my tuxedo made it very simple to return the item and get the right size .
2	how online_homebrew companys should be not like the other one i could mention .
2	will be ordering all my stuff from here
2	wont go into detail but bottom_line is the worst online company ever , con_men will take your money then not send your orders just bullshit email
2	age_partnership service from helen pearson very good .
2	speedy & efficient found new provider some 00_% better_than my pension_fund provider .
2	and would have no_hesitation in recommending them .
2	ordered my fencing on tuesday and it was delivered on thursday .
2	great service and good quality products .
2	i had never_heard of gadget_panda so was dubious_about sending off my ipad , especially as the price offered was so competitive .
2	i needn_'_t have feared anything though as the process was simple and straight_forward and the money was in my bank five days after i sent them the item .
2	i will_definitely use them again .
2	i was delighted with both the speed and quality of the service i received , and the product .
2	i will be back !
2	both the product ( a netbook ) and the service were excellent .
2	i would happily_recommend the company to others .
2	we found the whole_experience very easy collected keys at airport given a cd with facts about lanzarote to listen to in car and even easy when we return it filled out a form posted keys at desk and back home which was the not so nice bit get on the plane and fly away from the warm sunny island
2	seriously good wine with prompt delivery when it was expected .
2	not that much_cheaper but good for less well_known wines or vineyards .
2	brown brothers are well_known in supermarkets for some varieties but not the ones we like so it '_s good to find them .
2	i hadn_'_t expected such a painless experience - i was really impressed .
2	within five days all was complete totally without hassle .
2	i won_'_t hesitate next time - it will be mazuma first every time .
2	all pre_- order questions were answered quickly .
2	the delivery was prompt and the software ( visual studio ) was running within_00mins of delivery .
2	altogether a good experience - it is a company i will use again .
2	excellent company to do_business with , straight_forward , ordered , paid and delivered within 00_hours .
2	would highly_recommend
2	ordered an item , paid for it , waited for it to arrive , it didn_'_t .
2	i had to contact them to find out where item was , they said item had been sold in store on saturday , i bought item on the previous friday .
2	they were not in the slightest bit bothered , just said my money had been refunded , no apology , no alternative , no concern .
2	good luck with treating future customers this way .
2	we ordered from decuisine over a month_ago .
2	when the goods were not delivered i googled & saw all the bad feedback .
2	i phoned & was given a long plausible tale indicating delivery would be in a week .
2	no delivery so we asked for a refund .
2	no refund so i have my credit_card co chasing for the money back .
2	don_'_t believe their tales .
2	they are rogue_traders !
2	buyer_beware .
2	nb_: i '_m a real_person , not as they will tell you some competitor trying to ruin their reputation .
2	it '_s an easy site to navigate - the process is quick and prices seem good value
2	site came to me by word of mouth of a highly respected friend who loves their selection , prices and service !
2	! i totally agree .
2	downloaded a game very easy just got the game_keys from simplycdkeys and then logged_into steam and entered the keys , game was downloading instantly and played it in a few minutes , great
2	i needed to order some crocs for my daughter and as i had used this site before and it was a no_brainer .
2	great selection of items and very very good price .
2	great delivery service kept getting emails to tell my at what stage of the process my order was and very fast delivery just 0 days .
2	i got exactly_what i wanted for a good price .
2	it was delivered on time and they even took note of my specific delivery instructions ( so many don_'_t )
2	we enjoyed a family holiday in october in el gouna , approx .
2	00km '_s north of hurghada on egypt '_s red_sea .
2	i had pre_- booked online via resorthoppa . com .
2	the outward_journey was fine , apart_from being initially dropped at a hotel in hurghada instead of el gouna - i needed to call the number provided on our paperwork and ask them to send the driver back to pick us up !
2	on our journey back to hurghada airport , the driver was clapping to his favourite song on the radio , taking his hands off the steering_wheel whilst driving , he also took us on a short - cut , which initially went across a bit of desert on - route to an unfinished stretch of road , he then decided to drive on the wrong side of the road ( dual_carriageway ) against oncoming traffic for approx .
2	0km '_s , he also drove over a couple of speed - bumps much too quickly , as a subsequence my wife banged her_face ( had a nice bruised nose as a memento ), my son banged his head !
2	i complained to resorthoppa '_s customer_services a couple of weeks ' ago , however , i am waiting for their response - i won_'_t hold my breath ..!
2	quick and easy on line ordering , good confirmation and quick delivery i would defo_use these_guys again .
2	competitive_pricing with very quick delivery and very good communication with delivery department .
2	we have used several_times now and have never been disappointed .
2	easy to order with a competitive price and quick delivery .
2	will use again .
2	my order came in quick time as_described , very impressed and will use again
2	the companies who send parcels by this company should be_ashamed of themselves .... yodel is not fit for the purpose .... 0 cards were left and each time we went to their depot but was told we needed a tracking_number , but we didn_'_t have one so we couldn_'_t give one . on the 0th visit we were told it had been returned to sender .. the manager refused to talk to us ... the sender has not received it back even after 0_weeks and yodel does not know where the parcel is .. reading other reviews i can believe they still exist .... i would be_ashamed the even admit i worked for this company , thats if i did work for them but i dont .....
2	age_partnership offered the best deal .. i compared several other_companies before accepting their offer ... and i had my lump_sum paid to me within 0_weeks .. i cant_fault them in any way ... thank_you ... ref_000000
2	i ' d been looking for a reflection screen for a while for my small studio and found this on ebay .
2	it was the cheapest i could_find but the quality is excellent and once purchased was dispatched straight_away and arrived a day earlier_than stated aswell .
2	excellent service .
2	helpful and efficient - cannot ask for more than that
2	i ordered a couple of vet beds and they arrived within a couple of days , despite christmas on the horizon .
2	on opening the parcel , i realized i ' d ordered the wrong_size for the dog '_s crate and phoned viovet to ask what to do .
2	they were really helpful , suggesting the correct_size and having these with me within a couple of days ( despite christmas being even nearer ).
2	great prices , well_packed , helpful people - thoroughly_recommended .
2	i '_ve been using gjw for some years_now .
2	i '_ve never actually spoken to anyone there - there '_s been no need since everything seems to be clear and reliable from log - on to delivery - but the willingness to meet ( or exceed ) expectations seems to shine out .
2	the website is clear and intuitive , with a good search_facility .
2	prices are good , matching or usually beating other on - line suppliers .
2	i do check from time to time but the order always goes to gjw .
2	the added_bonus is that deliveries are fast and free - sometimes next_day if i ordered early enough .
2	can '_t speak highly_enough of them - i ' d recommend them to anyone .
2	and i lecture emarketing and retail marketing at a university !
2	i can '_t praise this company enough , for good friendly customer service , very competitive_prices and really fast delivery , they take some_beating .
2	look no further than , handles0homes .
2	ordered a northface padded jacket on the saturday_night , paid for standard delivery and it arrived on the monday_afternoon .
2	can '_t ask for better_than that !
2	oh , and the jackets excellent too !
2	ordered online on the monday_evening just after 0 . 00pm .
2	by 00 . 00pm i had received 0 e_- mails .
2	the first confirming my order , the second advising that it was being_processed and the third advising that it had been dispatched .
2	it arrived first thing on the wednesday_morning .
2	excellent service .
2	made several orders with protein foods and have never been let_down .
2	the quality of food is excellent and customer_care is second to none .
2	delivery has always been on time and fresh so as long as the prices stay reasonable i will kerp reordering and spreading the word !
2	oh and the new fajita chicken is lovely :)
2	was recommended you by my son in law - who sang your praises and you delivered in all_respects , just as he said you would ...
2	so thank_you - i am thrilled with my new canon_eos rebel 0 000d package with the 00 - 000 lens at the price you offered and delivered securely and efficiently to my home address in the uk within four days ... couldn_'_t have been any better !
2	glasses turned_up after 0 days including weekend .
2	i had never bought glasses on - line before but a friend recommended spex0less and i '_m really glad they did .
2	£_00 including delivery is fantastic from now on i '_m sorry specsavers you can test my eyes but i will be using spex0less for supplying my glasses from now on .
2	i have been flying with jet 0 the last couple of year to malaga it has_been a pleasure flying with them great flight times great staff always on time great leg_room and great value for money flights
2	frist time using shiply , and have found them very helpfull and professional , with great communication and will recommend them
2	i have only recently discovered printerland having procured two laser_printers and i have to say the service has_been second to none .
2	all the top quality makes available at excellent prices .
2	delivery was so quick i only just had time to clear the space of the old ( failed ) units !
2	why can '_t other_suppliers be as efficient and helpful ?
2	thanks printerland - i '_ll be back .
2	i bought a refurbished lenova thinkpad from them .
2	it arrived very quickly and is like new condition .
2	i paid extra for upgrades of ram & the hard_drive to a ssd_drive .
2	it '_s really fast and a joy to use .
2	i '_ve had an old ibm before and they are bullet_proof build quality - the old machine was on xp and getting very tired hence my purchase of this one .
2	i '_ve only had 0 problem - i could not get it to allow me to make a recovery disc - it said the a copy had already been made & you can only make 0 copy !
2	so who made and kept the copy ?
2	?
2	microdream did not supply one with the machine so i phoned their support , the guy said he couldn_'_t help & that i would have to contact lenova to buy a recovery disc .
2	considering i ' d spent £_000 on this machine i was rather peeved that they didn_'_t want to know about helping sort this problem .
2	eventually lenova supplied me a pair of discs but it cost me £_00
2	hence only 0_stars because of their disinterested customer_support
2	we '_ve_used this company loads of times now and can '_t recommend them enough , great service , best value of anywhere on the internet we have found .
2	bought these 0 tickets for a rugby game . they send me 0 attachments to redeem but like a numpty i only redeem one . realise my error too late and the other one has expired . terms and conditions_state , no refunds in this case .
2	so i ask anyway and a few_days_later get a refund for the unredeemed one , which i suppose they didnt need to do . good result as i use wowcher a lot , and this gave_me confidence to carry on
2	i '_ve bought a fair_amount of stuff from tier0 in the last few_years , typically these are graded refurbished_laptops or other computer / audio_equipment - though it has to be said that the difference in price between office quality ( dell and lenovo ) used and economy new at currys etc is less_than it was - i '_ve always been extremely satisfied with the value and quality of these deals , and the excellent service from the seller ( admittedly i have '_t experience of buying a dud ).
2	so a dell_d000 running vista professional through a core 0 duo 0 . 00ghz processor , 0gb_ram and 00gb hd - for £_00 !
2	didn_'_t need much thinking_about as an ultraportable back up machine , particularly for mp0 files .
2	it may seem pretty prehistoric stacked up against the latest ultrabooks , but more than does the job - and the one i got was pretty well pristine , with a battery still holding charge for 0 + hours .
2	excellent all_round
2	bought an ipod_nano 0th_gen at a very competitive price .
2	item in excellent condition though battery_life a little down .
2	all in all a great company to deal with , though wish i ' d never put my 0th_gen thro the washing_machine .
2	my dog is 00 years old & i would have to have him put to sleep if i hadf to pay the price that the vets wanted for the same medication . it is by the same maker but less then half the price . a great deal , thank_you very much .. i would recomend this company to any pet_owner wanting the best product at a great price .
2	we ordered some wallpaper on 00 / 00 / 00 , value £_000 . 00 .
2	everything seemed to go through ok , including on screen provision of order acknowledgement and order number .
2	however , the promised email confirmation never arrived .
2	there was a pending payment to homebase on my bank_account for this amount so i rang homebase to find out what is going on - turns_out they have no trace of my order !!
2	it seems that they have had " website " problems and the person we spoke to was unable to resolve the pending payment issues and / or reorder for us leaving us to sort_out with our bank ourselves - just spent 00_minutes on the phone to barclays sorting_out - apparently this is a regular_occurrence with homebase !
2	very disappointed both that things went wrong and with the lack of customer_services appetite to resolve their end .
2	jo harris
2	on departure , the driver arrived just as we unloaded our cases and on return we called as the last of our cases came off of the carousel and the car was waiting when we got outside the terminal .
2	will_definitely use again !
2	can '_t fault them .
2	the price offered was not quite the best but taking the option of argos_vouchers made it one of the highest .
2	whole_process from_start to finish was totally hassle_free and took less_than a week from my deciding to sell to receiving the vouchers .
2	will_definitely use them again .
2	good products fast service
2	i have used this company '_s products since_0000 and have always been very satisfied with the excellent performance of their software .
2	i am very pleased with the service i received from you and very pleased with how my items were packaged and would like to let you know that i will be definitely buy from you again many_thanks
2	this site was so easy to use .
2	quick fast and seemingly secure and easy to follow_instructions .
2	a child would have no_problems .
2	alltools thanks for the speedy delivery and great customer service , a great price for the makita_00v will use you again .
2	regards
2	stephen o ' connell
2	carpenter .
2	delivered on time , good value for the money , cannot_complain at the price .
2	one of the best online companies i have ever_dealt_with , easy to use website , great communication , quality products and fair delivery charges .
2	t shirt_studio is now our go to supplier for our club products .
2	first_class prices and service thank_you pedal_pedal
2	this was the first time that i have used this company and have to say that the service provided was excellent .
2	the price was the lowest on the internet and the item was delivered the next_day .
2	brilliant .
2	excellent experience , used company before and will do so again
2	price was amazing compared to all other golf companies on the item that i bought free next_day delivery was a definite positive
2	watchfinder offered a watch for sale on their website .
2	i clicked to buy and at the checkout applied the discount_code from the voucher they sent me and progressed sale in the normal way .
2	the next_day they called me and said they didn_'_t feel they would make enough money on the sale of the watch and wanted me to pay more money then we had already agreed on or they would cancel the sale !
2	!
2	trading_standards complaint registered and after talking to them they felt that watchfinder were in breach of contract and should have honour the sale agreement .
2	this isn_'_t my first purchase from watchfinder , the first didn_'_t go smoothly either , i won_'_t use them again , shortsighted approach by watchfinder as i generally spend more than £ 0000 on watches a year but none of it will be going to them after this .
2	so easy to order , selected my carrera 0000 on the iconic website paid the deposit , and was told 0 - 0 week delivery .
2	i was kept_informed by james at all times , when the watch was ready i made the final instalment and the watch was delivered the very next_day .
2	superb service and great prices , would most certainly use again .
2	products ordered at 0pm and delivered next_day before 00am .
2	0st_class service at a very competitive price .
2	we have recently_moved from a server based system to recruit so simple .
2	the transfer of 0 years worth of information from our old system was easy and seamless .
2	both david and andrew have been a pleasure to deal with and are quick to answer any_issues .
2	the system is still evolving and they will do what they can to incorporate any changes that are requested .
2	i would definitely recommend this to anybody that is looking for an easy to use and cost_effective recruitment software package .
2	i spent_ages changing spec on the website until i was happy with the spec and the price .
2	the wait while the computer was being built and tested was not a problem as my old computer was still running .
2	delivery was excellent even_though it was to the isle of man and the offshore delivery charge of £_00 was very reasonable .
2	all in all very satisfied with the service and the final product .
2	many_thanks .
2	ordered item by phone as in the isle of man .
2	carriage_charges very reasonable .
2	items delivered within 0 days and in good condition .
2	will use tis company again
2	excellent customer service .
2	price very good .
2	delivery to the isle of man resonably_priced and arrived within 0 days .
2	i would recommend a0boffice .
2	i '_ve emailed and requested callbacks and no response .
2	possibly the worst customer service on the internet .
2	i '_m having to resort to talking to my bank now to cancel payment .
2	00 . 00 . 00 : i '_m still_waiting for a refund .
2	someone did reply and told me a refund would be made and when i chased them four weeks_later he told me he could not tell me when a refund would be made .
2	i have now sent a request into barclays to do a chargeback on the payment .
2	i really can understand how a company like this can still be in business .
2	easy online quote and booking service .
2	direct contact confirmation .
2	text reminder .
2	trouble_free car collection .
2	very competive final price confirmation and and easy payment .
2	topped with washed car and trouble_free delivery back home .
2	perfect service .
2	service comparable with amazon and john_lewis .
2	well_done .
2	from_start to finish , this was one of the easiest , hassle_free orders ever .
2	great value and good communication too .
2	i bought a new husqvarna cth000 ride on mower from abbey_garden sales at the end of june and had nothing but problems !
2	the pre delivery inspection wasn_'_t done properly so it was delivered without an english_manual , 0 other handbooks in 00 languages , and i don_'_t speak any of them !
2	i rang the abbey and they said they ' d put one in the post , they didn_'_t .
2	0_weeks_later the deck belt broke , i rang again .
2	they said it wasn_'_t covered_under the warranty so i had to fork_out over £_00 for a new one , they posted it free with the manual .
2	once i read the manual , i realised it should have come with a bioplug , for the cutting deck , also missed on the pdi .
2	i rang them again , they eventually got back to me to say they ' d put one in the post .
2	it arrived within a couple of days .
2	i fitted the new belt this week and it was cutting fine , until one of the blades broke !
2	looks_like a fatigue fracture .
2	i wondered_if that was covered_under_warranty ?
2	it was .
2	0_weeks since the blade broke .
2	i ' d chased it up but abbey just kept giving excuses .
2	husqvarna told my supplier that it is covered_under_warranty but it still didn_'_t arrive !
2	i usually rely_on this months holiday to get my garden and paddocks in order for the autumn , but as the mower has_been unusable for the whole of august , i had no chance of doing it .
2	i bought this machine to solve my problems , not add to them .
2	after waiting for 0_weeks i got fed_up with all abbeys excuses , got husqvarna involved and they sent me a new blade themselves and it arrived the next_day , as abbey still hadn_'_t sent one .
2	abbey made no effort to contact me , i had to chase them for everything .
2	poor customer service and they couldn_'_t even say sorry !
2	excellent service
2	furniture arrived a day late , which cost us two_days in time .
2	the dressing_table stool , has now fallen to bits .
2	all of the fixings in the legs have pulled_out , and it is now unusable .
2	very poor construction , and looked weak before assembly .
2	very very disappointing , i '_ll buy from a good old_fashioned shop in future .
2	the dressing_table and bedside_cabinets , were in a thousand bits , and took_forever to put_together .
2	the paperwork says twenty_minutes , ha_ha !, no chance !
2	these did look very good when constructed though , and i am very satisfied with these .
2	however , prior to ordering , i did contact world_stores by phone , to ask about the amount of self_assembly there would be on these items , and he said " there is an element of self_assembly ".
2	this is a very misleading sales_technique , and in fact not true .
2	it is a complete self_assembly , the like of which i have never seen before .
2	i am fairly skilled being a shop fitter , but anyone with minimal skills would struggle .
2	i may report this as mis selling .
2	fantastic seats at jamie cullum concert , so close i could have been in the band !
2	!
2	tickets arrived early , and great communication_throughout by email .
2	i do not understand_why people complain_about the price , surely you read everything before you buy ?
2	if its too expensive , don_'_t go !
2	!
2	thanks again viagogo , if you could just sort_out some tickets to see led zeppelin , i ' d be really impressed
2	kev
2	have used ginger0 many_times and found there service excellent goods have always arrived on time and the prices are very competitive
2	every item i purchase was cheap that retail shop and other online site even when taking in the reasonable delivery charge .
2	all arrived promptly in good order .
2	will use power_tools direct again that '_s for sure .
2	ordered thursday_morning .
2	arrived saturday .
2	fast and efficient service and good value for money .
2	having discovered on sunday the front_wheel of my 0 + year_old xl000r trolley was broken , i fully expected to have to carry my bag around the course on the wednesday while waiting for a new part to arrive .
2	i was delighted to find a new wheel and axle delivered on tuesday in plenty of time for me to repair the trolley for use on wednesday .
2	many_thanks for the super_fast service .
2	0 large bags of james_wellbeloved ordered monday_evening , despatched tuesday and arrived wednesday_morning .
2	excellent service .
2	and brilliant customer service when i had to contact them because one of the bags had burst in transit .
2	i immediately received a partial_refund to cover loss and inconvenience .
2	the loss was minimal due to the fact that they despatch the manufacturer '_s food bags inside their own very strong plastic_sacks .
2	very sensibe considering how some couriers tend to treat the consignments !
2	found " tyre_shopper " after a google_search .
2	compared their prices against the likes of kwikfit , ats and black_circles , tyre shpper won hands_down .
2	quick call to the depot who were going to fit them so organise an earlier appointment than what was offered online and hey_presto the job was done .
2	highly_recommend giving them a try .
2	ordered on the 00th_dec , way way too late for xmas delivery i thought but received an email on the 00st to say that my order was being packed and that my delivery would be upgraded to ' next_day priority ' at no extra_cost .
2	received my oder next_day via_dpd who were also excellent as i received a delivery time that i could track .
2	first time i have used simply_electronics but will_certainly use again and recommend to friends and family
2	only found these_guys via ebay but they had an amazing price and shipped it same day .
2	courier was a bit_slow ( well it is xmas ) but 00 / 00 so_far , i '_ll be adding them to my go to list .
2	ive always had a very reliable service from dpd , the courier bloke i normally get is a cheery chap and they always deliver in the email time_slot .
2	miles better_than others like hdn etc i wish i could choose them for all my amazon deliveries .
2	this system is excellent i can put all my records onto usb_stick or sd_card and listen to hours of my favorite tunes perfect would recomend it to anyone .
2	excellent service from hifi - tower keep_up the good work guy , s .
2	bit_nervous at first as you are quire a new company but all went well .
2	the only time i had an issue was with email passwords :-
2	when i first signed_up with 0 u hosting you could have any email password with no issues .
2	now because of security you have to have an elaborate one which you can '_t remember .
2	when i got it wrong on different computers i was continually being locked and having to be reset which was very annoying .
2	now everything has settled down and i am_glad i stuck with them .
2	purchased a brunswick but0 tenor ukulele .
2	there was a delay with my original order , a brunswick but0 tenor ukulele .
2	when i contacted reidys , they were great .
2	they recommended the but0 and being a novice , they advice me on the difference_between them .
2	i would recommend reidys to anyone trying to purchase a instrument .
2	excellent item , good price and delivered on time .
2	used it and found it a good little tool , with or without the wheels .
2	the swivel handle saves a lot of bending .
2	top tool .
2	this is an update to my previous review please read that one .
2	on the advice of trading_standards to try and resolve my problem as mentioned in my review basicly the pixels were missing on my galaxy_note 0 after 0 months and went to cw for repair under_warranty and came back with a crack in the screen which was not there when they took the phone from me ( they were responsible for the crack ) anyway on ts advice i wrote to the managing_director by recorded delivery that letter which was signed for by this company has_been totally_ignored , not ever the courtesy of a reply i have sent another letter by recorded delivery will see what happens now .. then i am_afraid it off to court i have to say before i took the contract for the phone they were very helpful but once signed on the dotted_line customer service just doesn_'_t exist with these so called professionals anyone_thinking_about using these_people read all the reviews on this site and all over the web first i wish i had .
2	after all this i have just received an email from this joke company bearing in mind they damaged my phone this is the response i got also the two letters mentioned were sent by recorded delivery to the managing_director not the sender of this email as he seems to think ... read this : and think before you fall for it .
2	i regret that we will not be able to reach an amicable resolution to your complaint .
2	i feel that we have reached a position of deadlock , as i am unable to overturn the decision made by our repairs centre .
2	in terms of the two letters that you have advised you have sent to carphone_warehouse ; if these letters have been received in our central office , it is possible that they have not reached our department yet .
2	please_accept our apologies if this is the case .
2	i will arrange for a letter of final response and deadlock to be issued to your home address within 0 - 00 days .
2	please_accept my apologies that we are unable to further your complaint .
2	kind_regards

2	prompt service !
2	i recently_purchased a new , to me , car from stoneacre .
2	i must_say the service and respect shown to me was excellent .
2	from the sale through to aftercare i as the customer remained the main focus .
2	unlike_some other dealers whose customer service appears to be from the stoneage !
2	i would certainly recommend a visit if you are looking to change your car ........ which by the way i think are good all_round value .
2	my only_criticism was the free coffee was served in a plastic cup !
2	having now used looking0 0 times , i can safely say that there service is exemplary & we have never had a single_issue .
2	swift , courteous and very professional .
2	nice to use these words about customer service these days .
2	well_done !
2	my fitters arrived when they said they would and did a really thorough job - after_searching my car for the all important nut from the boot ... they checked everything was working just fine .
2	i have used event mobile tyres for years_now and would recommend them to anyone !
2	the website is very useful and the telephone ordering side was extrememly helpful on the two occasions i called .
2	the international delivery was easy and efficient .
2	i saved over 000_euros by sending our waste_disposal machine from the uk as_opposed to buying the same machine in france .
2	i thoroughly_recommend them .
2	fast shipping !
2	great upgrade to dell l000x 0 dimm slot max mem 00gb .. 0 slot only can accept max 0gb
2	decent produce and prices but they just can not deliver on time .
2	last_week 00_mins late this week 0 hours late .
2	customer_services are jammed and everyone blames someone_else .
2	back to tesco for me - the quality may be lacking but at_least you get to eat !
2	faulty device - wrote for advise - did not here a word - oh - device was for a friend .
2	paid £_00 for a package to be delivered from gloucester to leeds saturday delivery - so urgent .
2	no communication to me - package in hatfield delayed .
2	recipient got through to a human after 0 attempts on an 0000 number to be told the vanhad broken down so it wasnt just us affected and it might arrive on monday .
2	they boast they have 0000 vans .
2	do yourself a favour - dont use - suggest we start compensation campaign < sensitive data_removed_>
2	greenhouse not here by 0 day so phoned up .
2	they looked up details told me about small hitch and gave_me the number of the local depo where parcel went .
2	phoned them and they got the driver who had it , to drop it next drop .
2	0 mins later !!
2	pretty impressed .
2	greenhouse dead easy to put up i fact easiest i have tried but ends two of you .
2	00_mins all done
2	i bought a greenhouse a few weeks_ago and it was pretty reasonable
2	and a couple of days_later it arrived .
2	i bought the one with poly carbonate windows .
2	it took two to build and over 0 days instructions are fairly good and to be fair everything is really well labelled .
2	don_'_t try it unless there is no wind ( it does tell you this lol .
2	we had a gale blow through teignmouth 0 days_later and lost 0 panes but they were fairly easy to put back and being poly , were absolutely fine .
2	i would recommend them and the greenhouse .
2	the easiest site i have used for a long time .
2	the service matched , very quick and very well informed about what was happening from placing the order to knock on the door with the parcel .
2	would recommend this company to any body who will listen .
2	very good and fast efficient service , helpful staff and i ordered yesterday , delivered today , brewing tonight , you can not be_happier than that .
2	will recommend and deal with this company again .
2	a good company that has perfected system of van sign_writing which enables a small business like mine to promote itself in a professional_manner at very affordable prices .
2	good service , good product .
2	many_thanks
2	your local_garage_door man .
2	norfolk .
2	ordered one day , delivered the next free of charge . you cant_beat that for service , other_suppliers would take 0 -- 0_weeks . well_done to all concerned . all at a very good price .
2	ordered on line , very easy and well priced , delivered as promised .
2	no_complaints . well_done to all
2	i have never had any problem with this company , easy to order and the goods arrive in excellent time . i would certainly recommend this company .
2	dave / basingstoke
2	ordered on sunday and got my goods on monday and a free mug - brilliant !!
2	!
2	superb value and expertly delivered by nice lady
2	first time shopper and will now become a regular shopper .
2	i ordered a patio_set on a sunday_evening fully expecting the items to be delivered for the following weekend .
2	i chose economy delivery because the items would still have been delivered in time for the weekend .
2	primrose e_- mailed me to say that the items were out of stock but would be back in stock later in the week .
2	great .
2	i received an e_- mail to say the items were being despatched on the thursday and this provided a tracking_link to the delivery agent .
2	when i went_onto the delivery agents web_site via the tracking_link i was surprised to see that it said the item was at my local delivery depot but was being held over for delivery the following_tuesday , i . e .
2	after the weekend .
2	i rang primrose to ask why the item was being delayed .
2	they told me the item had been despatched on economy delivery and that precluded it from being delivered on a saturday .
2	to cut a long_story_short , primrose contacted their delivery agent and made certain the item was delivered on the saturday at their expense .
2	one of the chairs was found to be damaged and again the customer service team have bent_over_backwards to arrange for this to be speedily replaced .
2	i am an advocate and have bought a n umber of other items from this site because of their customer service ethos .
2	always good service
2	i have also experienced really bad customer service from superfi .
2	i bought a humax dtrt0000 / 0tb via another on - line retailer , thought it was so good i wanted another , they were out of stock , so i searched the web & found " superfi ", never_heard of them before but they had listed what i wanted .
2	so i clicked , added to basket , checked out , paid via_paypal - job_done with free next_day delivery , happy days !
2	instant_response from paypal stating the money had left my account .
2	i refreshed my emails , clicked send / receive several_times ... nothing from superfi , ok , bit_worrying , but ok .
2	the nextday , the delivery day , i still hadnt received any email or any response from superfi , so i called them .
2	first i tried their 0000 number ( fabulous a company with a free phone number ).
2	recorded_message stated there was no one available to take my call & duly cut me off .
2	that was option 0 on their list , so thought i ' d try option 0 their sales line ...... nope , silly me , after trying several_times on every available option & constantly getting cut_off ... i slowly started to panic , i ' d paid this company i '_ve never_heard of before a few_hundred_quid of my hard_earned_cash & now i could_find anyone who cared enough to answer the telephone .
2	i telephoned their nottingham store to ask if they were still in business , apparently they were , and the very helpful chap gave_me another number to call , not all bad ... could have just been me !
2	i called the other number .
2	the chap stated no i wouldnt have received any emails the item is out of stock , apparently i should have checked their stock_levels before placing the order ... strange !
2	i placed the order , they took my money , the deal was that they would deliver the next_day for free .... its the next_day & they ' re telling_me its not going to be delivered .
2	i asked to speak to his_supervisor & was told " oh he '_ll only tell you ...." thanks but i '_ll have a chat with him anyway if thats ok with you .
2	i did & was told that as i ' d paid them via_paypal and the item was out of stock , they ' d email me when it was in stock & notify_me of the delivery day then .
2	he couldnt understand_why i was getting annoyed .
2	explain please why i '_ve placed my order , paid my hard_earned & you '_ve not even sent me an acknowledgment email as a courtessay ?
2	explain_why your system took the order & didnt tell me that you were out of stock ?
2	explain_why i should check your stock_levels ?
2	explain what your company pays you for ... what exactly do you do ?
2	customer service manager is poorly_trained & dosent understand customer service , offered to pop round with a customer return product to replace the one i ' d ordered and refund £ 0 ..... nah , thanks , but ... i ordered new & kind of thats what i ' d like .
2	i '_ll wait the week for you to get it back into stock , and spend the day i wrote off to wait in for the delivery publishing my experience with your company on - line , if thats ok with you ?
2	after all , you '_ve got my money , you agreed to supply a product via next_day delivery and have entered into a contract as such , and you ' re now in breach of contract .
2	would i spend anymore money with this company , no thanks .
2	customer service just isnt there in relation to their on - line sales , retail sales staff are of course a different breed and do actually give a damn , which is unfortunate as sorry guys , but its now a company thing for me , i '_ll avoid you all .
2	sorry .
2	update in response to superfi '_s response :-
2	really amusing that of course its the customers fault as he " didnt see " hidden away information_relating to the companies stock_levels , nothing what so ever to do with my " order was accepted on a next_day delivery basis " & that no attention was drawn to the fact that the item was out of stock .
2	my order was accepted & payment made on the basis of next_day delivery , therefore a contract is in place & the company is required to deliver in line with that which was agreed , the company failed to do so and is therefore in clear breach of contract , and in my view should have made amends swiftly & openly .
2	i '_ve repeatedly stated that i received no correspondance what so ever in relation to my initial order , strangely , in english , this means that i received no correspondance what so ever from superfi in relation to my initial order , what part of that superfi dont get is beyond me .
2	it '_s quite wrong for people to assume things , causes all_sorts of problems .
2	this is further highlighted by the fact that the customer service manager aledgedly repeated all of the steps i made to test out the system and also received no emails - my experience in relation to this is that i received no emails from superfi at all in relation to this initial purchase , which means nothing went to my spam_folder either - i received no emails in relation to my initial order .
2	your reference to " we believe you normally work from home ?
2	", yet another assumption that is incorrect , i run a very successful company thats built up a reputation based on 000_% customer_satisfaction , not that its any of your business or that you would know anything about that .
2	glad that you '_ve confirmed that for the second_hand unit that you offered me you offered a £ 0 discount .
2	i ordered a new product , i paid for a new product , i expected a new product .
2	do you really think i ' d accept less_than a 0 . 0 %_discount to take a second_hand unit ?
2	who would ?
2	however , had you applied the same percentage discount as you claim was applied to the original rrp of the product to the 0nd_hand unit then that would have been a far more reasonable approach and one possibly worth considering .
2	there was no offer of a loan product , there was an attempt to talk me into taking the 0nd_hand unit & returning it under the " distance_selling rules " if i wasnt happy later .
2	but certainly no offer of " here take this one until yours arrives & we '_ll pick ours up later " as implied .
2	you dont get a second chance to make a first impression , i wont be shopping with superfi again .
2	as audio_visual is part of what my company does i ' d say superfi have lost out .
2	whilst writing this update i have recieved an email from superfi stating that my order has joined the que for picking , the first email in relation to this purchase & have a guess_what .... it didnt go into my spam_folder either !!
2	lets_hope that the product is in good order when it arrives , if not we '_ll end up in the court arena to resolve_matters as i '_m fed_up with such bad customer service & a clear breach of contract .
2	customers dont have to put up with bad service , and i wont put up with it .
2	i should state in fairness that the service that i received from the retail side of this company in specfic relation to this situation and their attempts to try & resolve_matters , was entirely decent & genuine , a shame this cant be reflected to the web side of this company .
2	bought 0 strip_lights via ebay , the photo showed 0 tubes inside the lights , the description referred to " tubes " plural , therefore its acceptable and perfectly reasonable for me to rely_on the phot & description - which i duly did .
2	i received 0x strip_lights with only one light in each one , not what was ordered .
2	i telephoned the company to let them know of their mistake , only to be very rudely_told to " get a life , go to b_& q and buy another light " and was then told to " go forth & multiply " ( only not quite so politely ) and the phone was put down on me !
2	how rude ?
2	what level of customer service could this be possibly described as ?
2	the matter has_been reported to ebay who are passing the matter onto their security team and also to derbyshire trading_standards .
2	would i buy from or recommend this company to anyone_else , not a chance !
2	follow_up : following factual feedback left for this company on the website on which it trades i have received several abusive emails .
2	perhaps the owner of the company has never_heard of the offence of " sending a malicious communication ".
2	i '_ve then received an email_telling_me i need to amend this review , clearly a complaint was received pointing at a minor technicality ( the owners language directed at me and duly accurately reported on here ).
2	whilst the owner of the company appears quite ready to spout abuse at people , he clearly doesnt like it when people report the facts of the matter for all to see , accurately & truthfully .
2	maybe he wont be quite so quick in future to treat people in the manner in which he treated me , but then maybe i '_ll win the lottery this week !
2	further follow_up : the owner of the company continues to object to factual feedback left for his company .
2	i have therefore made my own objections to the manner in which this chap continues to have the factual feedback left by many about his company removed for no reason .
2	kingston 00gb class 00 microsdhc card £_00 . 00 delivered , i bought two for £_00 . 00 delivered , checked out via_paypal & the amount changed from £_00 . 00 to £_00 . 00 .
2	cost me £ 0 + to phone them to cancel the order - disgraceful service from a uk company , will never be buying from them again .
2	customer service very slow too .
2	this product was a real eye_opener when i first used it .
2	compared to traditional car waxes , its easy to use and delivers excellent results which last longer , and it protects the paint finish too .
2	there is also no shelf_life and all that needs to be done is shake it to mix and activate .
2	for a family size car it can be washed and waxed in 00_minutes , from_start to finish , with no powder residues
2	golfbase has a good range of high_quality products at competitive_prices with a selection of delivery options and free returns .
2	i will_definitely use this company again and have no_hesitation in recommending them to other golfers .
2	consistantly great service makes julesb the only place to shop for quality goods on - line .
2	my custom is guaranteed .
2	mr_memory '_s website is a wealth of accurate information and help , the delivery and supporting_information is superb and the supplied product works faultlessly .
2	very impressed , happy and would highly_recommend .
2	quality products , displayed on a website i find easy to navigate , with all the information necessary to hand , and fast delivery .
2	what '_s not to like ?
2	!
2	prompt , efficient service , with good communication and excellent instructions .
2	ordered a set of clubs , great price and very fast delivery .
2	slight_problem was i ordered r / h but got sent l / h .
2	contacted to inform wrong clubs sent and problem was rectified quickly and efficiently .
2	very pleased with this company .
2	i wanted a secure case for the new iphone 0 .
2	it was not available yet but they allowed an email notification which promptly told me as soon as the article was available .
2	on ordering the service and delivery was excellent with regular text and email_updates .
2	article arrived in perfect_condition .
2	will happily use this company again and more than happy to recommend to others .
2	recently went to this company to buy a new keyboard .
2	rang the sales people and after helpful discussion got a very good deal better_than any competitor .
2	the keyboard had to be sourced and i was kept in touch throughout the process with timely emails and updates .
2	the delivery was then perfect arranged for a day i could be there to take delivery .
2	the sales_team do seem to want to provide a good customer service and not just sell , i was impressed with this .
2	i look_forward to doing future business with them .
2	i would recommend without_reservation .
2	i have bought a whole range of music kit from gear0music over the last_year including a synth and studio_monitors down to cables .
2	i have been extremely impressed with not only the very competitive_pricing but the efficiency of the delivery service .
2	when you want it , tracked all the way .
2	my one dealing_with customer_services was equally_impressive and helpful .
2	i have not yet found fault and intend to now use them as my main music kit provider .
2	well_done guys i am sure your business will go from strength to strength .
2	b . t .
2	for far too long have got away with ' blue - murder ' an out dated , over priced broadband service that is a disgrace for a once leader in communications .
2	i f you do not live in the london area do not expect good service from this awfull company .
2	the quality of service virgin gives leaves an awful_lot to be desired , to date i have attempted to set_up a direct_debit with them five times to no_avail , the ' cannot care - less atitude ' is awful for such a big company ... shame on you branson
2	tesco have really improoved over the years the quality of service is 0nd to none , drivers delivering shopping are always on time , polite and very helpfull .
2	most products have little or no details regarding sale item , site security crazy .
2	a fast service with great prices , delivery really excellent , well_packed so no_qualms there !.
2	have told friends about " box " afew have investigated and where impressed .
2	well_done " box ", be buying again .
2	gordon smith .
2	placed the order on - line , followed the order tracking and sat back to wait delivery .
2	my wetsuit arrived as ordered , well_wrapped and in good order .
2	i would definitely use them again .
2	having used facewest a few_times , and never had any_problems with them .
2	from the speedy service to the choice of equipment from various manufacturers means i will keep_coming_back to facewest .

2	i drew up outside black_circles unit , found it clean and tidy . i then entered reception and a friendly young_lady checked my tyre details were correct and then showed me through to a very comfortable lounge , with a colour telly . a short while later the young_lady returned and said my car was ready , well within the time limit stated . after going online to find tyres , only black_circle had these prices , kwik_fit and halfords were double , yes doule the price of black_circles tyres . dont look anywhere for tyres until you have seen black_circles prices . would i use black_circle tyres again , yes they are my number one choice , and the staff are very pleasant and courteous from the time i ordered my tyres till they were fitted . 00 out of 00 for the staff !!!
2	thankyou for the keyring , i appreciate it , as i collect keyrings . see you next time i need a tyre . davie s . wheeler
2	never_heard of them till i went_onto site for car parts , will use them again definately
2	superb delivery times , well_packaged and product does_exactly_what is says on the box !
2	will use this company again .
2	excellent value for money and quite sturdy , good delivery time .
2	my son in law is going to buy some after_seeing mine .

2	i ordered a completely standard pair of glasses on 00th .
2	september with a website promise of 0 days delivery .
2	here i am practically a month later and am still_waiting !
2	!
2	i put in a support request for ' where is my order ' and three_days_later was advised ,
2	" please_accept our apologies for the delay of your spectacles , there has_been a delay of the lenses for your spectacles .
2	we assume your glasses should be with you till the end of next week ."
2	apart_from making very little sense i ' assume ' my glasses will not be delivered until the 00th .
2	october , fully five weeks after they were ordered .
2	five weeks_ago they banked my money and i '_ve received nothing .
2	well , my friend , what do you think of it so_far ?
2	rubbish
2	this transaction could hardly be_faulted , much wider_range than available on amazon or other_sites i tried .
2	excellent layout on the website to make shopping quick and easy and delivery was made in double quick time .
2	communication was polite and informative .
2	all in all a pleasure to do_business with this company .
2	i can '_t praise this company highly_enough , and this from someone_who is not slow to voice displeasure with poor customer service .
2	i always use them now , karina remembers me when i call , she remembers where i have traveled previously , she gets me bargains , she calls you back when she says she will ( if not sooner ), they answer the phone immediately - every time - and there is no recorded humph to go through .
2	this is how business should be done over the phone .
2	bt , apple , sky , british_gas , lloyds , tsb , clydesdale bank - please take_note !!!!
2	!
2	placed my order on the monday and my items arrived by the wednesday .
2	box was well_packed with and hence the items arrived in perfect_condition .
2	this was my 0st order but it will not be my last .
2	great service .
2	thanks
2	googled for tourist rates and tcc came out best for rate .
2	ordered @ 00 : 00 and currency on doorstep @ 00 ; 00 next_day .
2	they do exactly_what it says on the tin - no one else will get a look in in future .
2	decided to place an order for a water rowing_machine costing_£_000 as it looked cheap .
2	finally received the product yesterday , not only with packaging in poor condition but also with half the rower missing .
2	the guy_who delivered it said there was definately only one box ( paperwork said box 0 of 0 ), and duly dumped the product on the drive and cleared off .
2	i then had the nightmare experience of actually trying to speak to someone at amazon , is anyone actually employed on customer service , no human voice can be found ?
2	gave up in the end , and returned to the amazon website to try and arrange a collection and refund , a much_easier process than trying to find someone to talk to , but again no option shown for a part delivered product .
2	amazingly , on requesting a refund last night , my wife gets a call today from amazon , confirming they have located our missing box ( after saying there was only one box ) and would arrange a second delivery ( another day of work for my wife ).
2	stay well clear of this outfit , bad delivery company , poor packaging , non_existent customer service , no compensation offered to us for having to take a further day off work .
2	they may look cheap , but when you factor in the cost of their awful customer service , you will regret you didnt go_elsewhere .
2	the order actually arrived less_than 00_hours after it was placed .
2	it also arrive exactly at the time indicated on the schedule email .
2	the purchase experience was excellent , having made a small error in my address , it was fixed with minimum_fuss .
2	will_definitely use guitarguitar again .
2	for a couple of weeks before any trip_abroad i check this site daily and when i eventually order my currency i do so knowing full well that i have got the best rates .
2	surfdome had the greatest selection of kit to choose from and the whole shopping_experience was really easy .
2	using this service for the first time , i was a little_hesitant , even anxious .
2	however , any misgivings i might have had were completely_unfounded .
2	what a brilliant way to get foreign_currency .
2	i shall_certainly use this service again .
2	maxram is saved as one of my favourite sellers and i wouldn_'_t think of shopping anywhere_else for my printer_ink .
2	with so many sentimental memories attached to our vinyl collection , i bought this piece of kit primarily for the record deck facility .
2	however , given all its other facilities , ( tuner , cd , mp0 , cassette ) i '_m wholly impressed with it .
2	the sound quality and levels are what you would expect from two small internal speakers , but it '_s perfectly_adequate for the average living_room .
2	it looks_smart and , for the price , it '_s brilliant !
2	i '_ve_used shiply on several_occasions and wouldn_'_t think of starting anywhere_else now when looking for a courier .
2	i know that when i '_ve accepted a quote through shiply '_s excellent service i can relax and whatever it is to be collected and / or delivered will be taken_care of without_any hassle .
2	i came_across the lindy web_site whilst randomly searching on ebay .
2	liked the look of the prices compared to others , so ordered some replacement leads .
2	these were delivered within 00_hours !
2	brilliant .
2	i found gak online when i was looking for a gibson_les_paul guitar .
2	i emailed them with a stock enquiry to see if they had the guitar i wanted .
2	the guitar in question was a gibson limited_edition les_paul studio deluxe ii in honeyburst .
2	they got back to me in less_than an_hour to say it was in stock i was given a name and a direct phone number to call which i did .
2	the chap i spoke to was really friendly and very helpful , i ordered the guitar and it was with me the following_day , when i opened the hard case it came in i looked in awe at a thing of beauty and a work of art completely surpassing my expectations .
2	i can highly_recommend gak and would not_hesitate to buy off them again .
2	i ordered a camera lens off them over £ 0000 worth .
2	their website said it was in stock .
2	they say it will be shipped in 0 - 0 days but could take 0 - 00 days .
2	they took the money out of my account right away , the lens was not in stock or it would have been sent out to me .
2	i inform my credit_card company who said cancel the order .
2	it took seven emails to get a response and then it was because i started to get really nasty with them .
2	a waste of time ringing them as it '_s easier to get hold of elvis .
2	they are then contacting me asking to lt them fulfill the order ; have it by the end of the week etc .
2	remember the website said it was in stock .
2	i said no refund me .
2	although in my account status it says refund in progress three_days_later still no money transferred back into my account .
2	do not think about ordering anything off this totally_useless oufit .
2	picked_up on time .... delivered on time .... and at a great rate .
2	what more can you ask for ?
2	good product , prompt delivery , excellent value for money .
2	have used many_times .
2	offered great advice when i made enquiries regarding printers
2	ordered a couple of christmas_presents from jac in a box - not only were they cheaper_than amazon , but delivery was quicker as well !!
2	fantastic .
2	ridiculously priced prescription_glasses .
2	they can '_t be that good .
2	yes they are .
2	very comfortable , crystal_clear and smart .
2	i love this type of nose_bridge , i normally have a problem with pinching of my nostrils , not with these .
2	bought two_pairs , one to carry one to leave in the car .
2	excellent buy , very happy .
2	very quick to fill my prescription , two_pairs with different_types of lenses , distance , computer and reading and the quality is excellent .
2	i have shown them around work and already two colleagues are in the process of ordering their new glasses .
2	i would highly_recommend them to anyone
2	second order from printerland , website easy to use and delivered on time .
2	this is a great way to get steam_keys , thought it was a scam .
2	but it does what it said on the tin .
2	thumbs defiantly up for these_guys .
2	i needed replacement shafts for a sledgehammer and a garden fork .
2	found both on the easy - to - use tw_wholesale website and at very reasonable prices too .
2	ordering was simple and they were despatched almost_instantly .
2	delivery was to a scottish highland address but unlike_some , there was no added delivery surcharge .
2	both handles look to be good quality .
2	have used this company before and will do so again .
2	was needing a lightweight petrol_strimmer and saw the offer of a good value well_known_brand_name on their e_mail alert .
2	ordered using the company '_s simple process and the goods were despatched promptly and delivered on the day they said they would be .
2	used the company before and will not_hesitate to do so again .
2	easy booking , good value , punctual , no_hastle .
2	i '_ve had one expensive pair of specs reglazed , and bought one cheap pair for reading .
2	the cheaper pair came very quickly , reglazing took an little_longer ( i had the send off my frames and the lenses were high_index varifolcals ) but in both_cases i '_m happy with the result and they were a lot cheaper_than buying from my usual optician .
2	i had read other reviews where people had some bad_experiences , but the price different was so significant i thought it was worth the risk and i '_m glad i went_ahead - my own experience has_been excellent .
2	first they fail to deliver , but pretend they did .
2	we were in at the time they claim they delivered , and not even a " you were out " card left .
2	so i track it down , and request delivery 0 days_later knowing i '_ll be away for 0 days - and they just dump it on the doorstep while we ' re away !
2	i raise a complaint , and they respond with an_automated email_saying that as they '_ve now resolved it and talked to me the case is closed - but they haven_'_t contacted me at all !!!
2	this is just staggeringly bad and i wish amazon would stop using them .
2	why pay for prime if the courier is rubbish !!?
2	?
2	hello new ford roof_bar keys service was very fast
2	every company is open to mistakes , it '_s an inevitable factor about being human .
2	what '_s important is how you deal with the mistakes .
2	if you have a problem with any organisation , the best approach is to firmly state your case but always be polite .
2	i have been with orange since they started and always conducted myself this way over the occasional issues that crop up with them .
2	in my experience orange have always looked to putting effort into a resolution .
2	having said this , most of my assciation over the years with orange has not involved submitting complaints to them but with benefitting from a good general level of service
2	i created an advertising postcard from goodprint '_s templates and then asked for a few_tweaks to totally personalise them to my requirements .
2	the tweaks were turned round within a few hours , after which i placed an immediate order , which i received within 0 days .
2	good price too !
2	know your broadband_speed accurately ad simply .
2	have a record at hand so as to know when things are working as they should .
2	i had an extremely distasteful first - time experience with viagogo when buying e_- tickets for a concert .
2	despite choosing e_- tickets and paying , the e_- tickets were not available .
2	this was not clearly_stated before the transaction .
2	their client service refused to cancel the transaction .
2	i was told to resell the e_- tickets , even_though i had not received them .
2	with " small fees '" of course .
2	this is a sham .
2	fees paid to viagogo for buying and reselling e_- tickets without received the tickets at all !
2	this is misleading , unclear , a rip - off and completely customer - unfriendly .
2	nice way to treat a first - time customer ... which speaks_volumes .
2	vianogo .
2	i spoke to american_express who told me to beware and to rely only on reputable establishments such as fnac .
2	easy to order and always seem to have stock .
2	great with free next_day delivery this month .
2	cheapest price that i could_find for 0 . 0 " 000 gb internal drive .
2	well_worth looking at the daily_deals .
2	reputable and reliable .
2	excellent selection of frames at high_street beating prices .
2	their own_brand frames are just as stylish and well made as the ' named ' brands .
2	i am now onto my 0th purchase from here .
2	i have bought a canon a0 photo printer and inks from office - etc .
2	it was the cheapest site i could_find and included free delivery .
2	in the end i paid a small extra delivery charge for next_day with dpd .
2	with inks delivery is quick even with the free service which again seemed to be dpd .
2	i would now always check their prices when making printer supply orders .
2	i had an issue with a collection today and a person called samatha solved this issue so professionally and quickly that it did not waste my time like other online_chat or call_centres .
2	parcel0go is a great service you should use it
2	they let you know your parcel is on its way by text and email .
2	i ordred a makita_mitre_saw it was here the next_day , good quick service and a great saw .
2	and the best prices for tools .
2	the site promised delivery on a tuesday if ordered on a sunday and this is what occurred .
2	the product ( scansnap s0000i ) arrived in good order and as_described .
2	i was impressed with the follow - up e_- mail checking that delivery had been made .
2	after all the bad_reviews on here , i almost didn_'_t use music_magpie .
2	i decided to as the iphone_app made scanning the items in so quick .
2	everything_went_smoothly , the courier turned_up on the day they said , and i got my check earlier_than_expected .
2	a couple of discs got rejected , but then i thought a couple of them looky borderline anyway .
2	most of the criticism seem to be over price ... i am not sure why as the app tells you exactly how much you are going to get for each item .
2	i could have wasted hours of time ebaying these things for maybe 00_% more .... but if you value your time .. this was easy .
2	easy site to choose correct_memory required , easy to order and prompt delivery .
2	easy to install using instructions provided .
2	all in all great service - will be ordering more soon to upgrade a laptop .
2	thank_you
2	i had two upvc doors installed in january .
2	looked for ggf endorsement and expected quality work .
2	so many faults it was unbelievable .
2	ok , the repairs have been dealt_with now , but should never have happened in the first place .
2	and when i contacted ggf '_s compliance manager i was told there was nothing they could do .
2	looking for parrot_food ?
2	i used to buy the food for my parrot , jasper , in 0lb bags , but i had to go a fair distance to get it .
2	i found this place , northern_parrots on line .
2	they sell 00lb bags of pretty bird much_cheaper , and i don_'_t have to go hunting for it .
2	they deliver fast and free .
2	they also sell just about everything my parrot is ever going to need .
2	i bought an ipad 0 on simply_electronics website on 00 / 0 / 00 .
2	unfortunately due to unforseen circumstances i had to cancel the order on 00 / 0 / 00 , but was told the item hadn_'_t been shipped so all was ok .
2	i was assured the refund would be made in 0 / 0 working_days .
2	when that didn_'_t happen , i emailed again , and this time the refund time went up to 00 working_days .
2	still no refund , but everytime i email i '_m told ' few more days '.
2	this mornings email stated " our accounting department is very much aware of your case and they are on their best effort completing each and every refund case as fast as they possibly can .
2	with this said , please immediately contact us again using this email thread in any case no refund confirmation will be received after few more working_days .
2	onceagaion , we would like to seek your extended patience on this matter as we look_forward having your case resolved ."
2	i have contacted barclays whose card i used to make the purchase , and they are taking over my case .
2	they have assured me i will get my money and they will get it back fro se .
2	be warned before you buy from this company .
2	i can now add to the review .
2	at last i have got my refund of over £_000 , but it '_s taken almost a month .
2	all i got was emails saying a few more days , another few_days .
2	eventually i replied to one email_stating that i was handing everything over to barclays to recover my money .
2	would you believe it , two_days_later i got an email_saying that the money was no_longer in their account , but depending on how long barclays took to process the payment , was how long before i would see it on my statement .
2	don_'_t get caught by this company - read all the other reviews - nearly all say similar things , either item not delivered , or no refund received .
2	never again , and i '_m going to advertise the problem i had to make_sure as many people as possible are aware of the way this company goes about their business .
2	...
2	but the help line ( i rang them twice on this matter ) could not explain in simple english one of the most fundamental questions : what exactly the " settle " button does and how do we know the figures it gives is correct - yet every night we are told to press it , print it and throw_away the report it creates .
2	what is going on - does anyone really know ?
2	saying it pushes the payment to the bank - so what ?
2	why do i need a report for that .
2	why are there so many breakdowns in the printout ?
2	why is the settle figure different from the z ( end of day ) figure ?
2	something bigger is going on and i am exasperated that i have no understanding of it .
2	its my money and i want to know !
2	what a reliably well run company .
2	i needed something in a rush .
2	no problem !
2	one phone_call and the next_morning first_class 0am delivery as promised .
2	the prices are amazing too - how do they do it ?
2	.... they the new " amazon of the outdoors "!
2	vispi jamooji
2	fast delivery and good value .
2	disappointed i messed_up the order for the heel protector but should have double_checked before confirming .
2	0 / 0 price delivered in 0 days .
2	not sure how they can do it .
2	speedy delivery
2	well_packed and great price
2	easier drop_off at heathrow_t0 you could imagine .
2	very thorough_inspection and well turned_out driver .
2	on return the driver was already there with the car and from passing through customers to driving away was about 00_mins ... amazing !
2	use this service it is unbeatable .
2	booked a call , was the right price , engineer turned_up on time and was very helpful .
2	all good .
2	can i recommend bullguard online backup as a service then the answer has to be " no ".
2	as a customer for some years and using the service to protect the data for a small company ( 0 pcs ) we need a service we can_rely_on .
2	bullguard have decided to upgrade the service during oct ' 00 without_any warning to customers or any information on their service status page .
2	the result is constantly failing backups and a service that i cannot rely_on or trust and one that i have to supplement with local manual backups .
2	they have now told me that this situation could last 00 days - a service that i am paying for which is not delivering and cannot be trusted to backup our latest data .
2	worst of all is the lack of communication before they went_ahead and put customers data at risk .
2	poor show bullguard - am_currently reviewing alternatives with a better service policy and will not be renewing .
2	and they took 0 months to reply to this !!!!!
2	!
2	very quick delivery , would use again
2	first time have used this company will use again .
2	have been happy with all my purchases
2	will use again , very easy to use website .
2	always great when a company beats expectations .
2	collected a and shipped an auction house item very quickly and got it to me a lot faster_than promised .
2	next_day delivery , the cheapest price i could_find on the internet , looks simple to fit .
2	bring on tostie toes
2	great service is in the little details - and this company has clearly spent the time getting the little details correct .
2	then , they offer great value on top - what '_s not to like ?
2	i have now used castlegate 0 times and each time the service excellent .
2	products were delivered quickly and very well_packaged .
2	their communication is very storng with regular_updates of progress on the order and delivery information from their courier .
2	their prices are as good as anyone_else - i have searched the internet for many lights and most companies seem to charge similar prices ( presumably they all get similar discounts from the suppliers ).
2	castlegate do include bulbs though whereas many others don_'_t .
2	when prices are similar , the key differentiator is service and i can '_t fault castlegate on this .
2	i am very pleased with my new wardobes from slidiing wardrobe world .
2	i ordered 0 sets of made to measure doors .
2	the first was a 0 door set with one angled door and the other a 0 door set .
2	i chose to construct the interiors myself which kept the costs down .
2	overall i saved at_least 00_% against what the established wardrobe fitters would charge .
2	i emailed and spoke to both mark and marie prior to and after_placing my order .
2	they were polite and extremely_helpful and always came back to me when they said they would .
2	i found the design tool on their website to be very helpful and marie gave_me sound_advice during my planning phase to ensure that i got my measurements correct .
2	i would advise others to triple check their measurements to make_sure you get it right and if in doubt call them for advice .
2	the doors were delivered within their quoted 0 - 0 week time frame and the quality is excellent .
2	installation was relatively straightforward for me ( a competent_diyer ) although a second pair of hands is advisable as the doors and panels can be quite unwieldy to move .
2	i would certainly recommended sww to others .
2	i ordered at 00 . 00am and had confirmation of dispatch by 00 . 00am - 00_minutes is impressive by anyone '_s standards .
2	item received the next_day in perfect_condition .
2	good prices too .
2	recommended .
2	i received useful advice from them on the phone and then purchased my cables .
2	the order was processed and delivered quickly .
2	happy to recommend .
2	my local tesco charges approx_£ 0 . 00 for 0 pods .
2	i bought 00 for £ 0 . 00 from vanilla_mart delivered free within 0 working_days .

2	!
2	fast and efficient service with good prices .
2	products were well_packaged and arrived on time .

2	i searched for almost a day on the net and could not find any slings that match my mothers requirement and budget .
2	i come_across this sling and the price was perfect .
2	when it arrived we were surprised with the fantastic quality of the sling and the speed that it was delivered .
2	highly_recommend this company and will by more mobility_aids from them in the future .
2	thanks for a perfect service .
2	i was contacted by optical_express by phone many_times telling_me that there is a surgical procedure to cure my vision .
2	i kept asking them if they are certain of that as i only have glasses for reading .
2	anyway they assured me that there was and an appointment was made in november_0000 with their consultant .
2	i drove from long eaton to optical_express shop in derby and after five_minutes of filling forms they told that there is no sugical procedures to correct my vision but i obviously need glasses ( how sly are these_people ).
2	i had my eyes_tested and i kept telling them that i drive over 00_hours daily for living and it is very important that i have full field of vision .
2	they sold two_pairs of vary focal_glasses to me and i paid them £_000 . 00 .
2	after two_weeks they arrived and i put them on , they seems alright .
2	as i drove home i realised that i had focused vision only in front of me and simple_task of negotiating round abouts and looking in the side mirrors with blurred_vision was impossible and i had to turn my head round so much that my neck started hurting me .
2	the next_day i put them on and within two hours i began to have headache .
2	so i took them off .
2	this went on for a week when i took them back and took the manager of the shop that i would like a refund .
2	he told me that i should contact their head_office and arrange for a refund .
2	i did that and i was contacted by the manager of derby optical_express to go down and have my eyes_tested to find out why i get headache .
2	at the test they readjusted the frame and i was told to wear them for two_weeks and then go back .
2	i had two_weeks of headaches and went to my appointment .
2	i asked for a refund and this time they took the glasses of me and told me that the refund will be in my credit account by 00 days .
2	i travelled overseas and returned in late march when i realised that no refund was paid into my credit account .
2	i rang the manager of derby optical_express and told_him that i would go to the shop so that he can arrange for the refund , he told me that if i go to the shop he will throw me out of the shop .
2	so i went to the shop on 0nd_april_0000 and asked for my refund , he called westfield security and had me removed from the shop .
2	i called 000 and asked for police .
2	two police officers arrived while westfield security was standing around me .
2	the police officers managed to convince the manager to pay the refund .
2	i went back with the police officers and a refund was paid to my credit account .
2	why not do this in the first time some three month_ago .
2	i went home and checked my statements and realised that they have not refunded me the full_amount .
2	so i am trying to contact the police officers to accompany me back to the shop to find out why !!!!!
2	the lesson for anybody reading this is do not go to optical_express even if you have to use their toilets .
2	i found this company online while looking for an inexpensive answer to that of checking that cash has_been correctly counted and entered into bags .
2	i purchased a mini electronic scale which would weigh up to 0kg in tenths of a gram for about £_00 .
2	this machine has turned_out to be just what i needed .
2	the order process and delivery were easy and trouble_free .
2	i would recommend our weigh to anyone .
2	cant_fault sangamo on information and delivery .

2	i hired • canon_ef 00 - 000mm_f_/ 0 . 0 l is ii_usm for a busy weekend football / wedding and rugby but unfortunately it was only used at the wedding .
2	it was delivered to my work place with emails_letting_me know all what was going on .
2	lens performed great with positive_feedback from my infomal shots .
2	return of the lens was easy using the same packaging and again emails exchanged to confirm things .

2	i was very impressed with the service provided by age_partnership with regard to identifying the optimum return relating to my personal pension ..
2	the process was straightforward and contact was friendly , personal and effective .
2	information was conveyed timeously and with clarity .
2	completion of the transaction was well within the time frame originally noted .
2	my initial_enquiry to age_partnership has_proved extremely worthwhile .
2	being a keen_photographer , i had decided to show my photos online so i registered a domain and ordered a hosting_package with a well_known company that i used for the local archery club website .
2	i use wordpress for all my websites .
2	my experience with this host was a nightmare .
2	very slow and constant database connection errors when editing .
2	after getting_nowhere with support , i gave up and decided to look for another host .
2	after much research , tsohost looked a good bet .
2	ever_since switching my personal websites to tsohost i have had good speed and no more database connection errors .
2	very happy !
2	!
2	i can now put as many photos on the site without having to worry_about load times and errors .
2	the hosting for the archery club website was due for renewal with previous host .
2	this is now hosted with tso and performs so much_better .
2	i highly_recommend tso .

2	property as_described .
2	picked_up at flagstaff airport , dropped_off at san_francisco airport .
2	nice car , nearly new .
2	good value by british standards .
2	just one difficulty - trying to fill the car up with gas you have to pay upfront without knowing how much you need .
2	this a universal problem though , nothing to do with the hire company .
2	item delivered on time and was as_described .
2	fast , efficient service .
2	purchased this device after a non - technical approach to my needs for how i could make bet use of the equipment i had - having used apple '_s ipad for some time , the software i used on mac / pc was fine , but had no convenient way to interface the two - this device ticks_all the boxes - as do the staff for their comprehansive non - jargon approach to resolving my plethora of questions - i was made to feel the important_factor in the business , and that '_s why i always keep going back - and never come away empty_handed :) just another reason to travel the extra_mile - when you find quality , you want to stay there - and advise others to do the same .
2	quick and trustworthy
2	i spoke to russel yesterday_afternoon 00 / 00 / 00 and asked if i order now can i get it delivered tomorow .

2	quiet_pc computers are fantastic with an excellent support service .
2	before finding quiet_pc i tried a number of other custom - built computer companies and had to return their computers as not being satisfactory .
2	quiet_pc was the company i had been searching for .
2	super efficient service and a pleasure to chat to .... thanks very much !
2	so simple and reliable to use would recomend to all very fast service
2	i bought a mahalo ukulele but i needed to enquire_about it first as it was a clearance item .
2	it was listed with damaged packing but in good order .
2	i rang sales to enquire_about it and my mind was put at ease by the listener .
2	i was impressed that confirmation emails of the order and tracking emails quickly followed .
2	on the day of delivery i was informed that it would be delivered on that day and a final email to confirm delivery .
2	this was a great service and one which i would fully recommend .
2	the offer of after sales support from the knowledgeable_staff is an added_bonus .
2	would not use this company again .
2	the flowers were dying within a day of receipt .
2	i bought them for my wife for christmas and i am_afraid that they were a disappointment .
2	i did however receive a full_refund for them .
2	have bought a few items from student_computers over the last few_years and have always been very happy to deal with them .
2	the products have always been as_described and have arrived promptly .
2	had paid for a before 00 delivery so was expecting first_class .
2	was very pleased with the professional service from dpd who were the carriers for internet company " spotbuyer " on this occasion .
2	received a text stating delivery would be between 00 and 00 .
2	also the option to rearrange delivery to either a neighbour or another date .
2	i needed to go out just before 00a . m .

2	my microwave arrived quickly and it was really helpful to have some warning about the delivery .
2	i was very impressed with the quick build of the pc but more than that the regular_updates over the five days as to how it was going .
2	i have just received an email from the company asking me how it is going and they have quickly replied to the one query that i made to them .
2	i know the computer was a good spec because of the computer shopper best buy recommendation but i was surprised by the friendliness and efficiently of the company .
2	ordered thursday delivered before 00am saturday , guitar package i ordered perfect cannot rate high enough , very impressed i will be using gear0music all the time from now on .
2	the products arrived well_packaged , and considering they were fragile not too much packing .
2	one aspect to consider if anything is how much packaging to use .
2	the products were good value .
2	the ordering_process was excellent and being_able to configure an all in one pc to a very high specification for the price was a big plus .
2	i chose to have a blank pc with no os as i had some spare windows 0 pro licenses .
2	i contacted pc_specialists 00 working_days after my order as it was not even registering as in build .
2	i was informed that they had a problem with a batch of chasis and they were meant to be in tomorrow ( thursday ) the guy said he would rush the build due to the wait and put the pc on special saturday delivery if it was ready to post on friday .
2	it had been quite a long time but i was happy with the response .
2	i got an email it had been posted friday but delivery was not on saturday as promised but on monday .
2	when the all in one pc arrived i was very happy with the quality for the price , the only
2	problem with it at all was they had installed windows 0 home version , so just made installing my version take a bit longer , i am not sure why they give a no o / s installed version then install one .
2	but as the title_states i would rate the actual kit and price as 0_stars only gave three due to timescales , being told i would get free saturday delivery and not and being told no o / s would be installed when it was but overall very happy and would reccomend them if you do not mind waiting a month .
2	i always use this safe service to pay for items , its easy to use .
2	arrival times for goods is really quick , and the service overall is excellent
2	i was looking for a competitive tyre price and tyre_shopper could not be_beaten .
2	0 days for a fitting service , happy with that as its within 0 miles of my home .
2	will use again .
2	the item was delivered fast and was exactly as advertised with prices that are very competitive i would use again
2	my wife and i ordered a range cooker and a dishwasher from an online company ( not curry '_s ) and we were informed knowhow were going to deliver it .
2	they supplied us with text_messages to say they would be delivering it but no reference_number should we need it .
2	we had a text on the day of delivery to say it would arrive but no time .
2	i took the opportunity to disconnect our old cooker and stick it in the garden .
2	at 0pm we were called but missed it .
2	an answerphone_message said the delivery could not come today as they were having trouble with their trailers and we should call them back on the number supplied .
2	easier said than done .
2	the usual loads of options followed_by endless minutes of waiting .
2	the person_who answered could not help us because we did not have a reference_number and they said they would get the person_who left the message to call us .
2	she did not .
2	we had to call her and again had to endure the wait .
2	we were told that the delivery would be rescheduled for the next_day .
2	no real apology or regret was conveyed to us .
2	i was fuming and asked what sort of compensation we could expect because we had nothing to cook on and also had a lodger who would not be able to prepare meals either .
2	i asked for £_00 which i thought a reasonable and not extortionate_amount .
2	i was told £_00 was all they could go to .
2	pathetic response from a pathetic company
2	i have bought two tyres and book the mot_test at the same time .
2	the service i received was exceptional and great value .
2	i have used national_tyre services before and find them to be the best for value and friendly service ever .
2	will recommend to everyone .
2	i hired a car through their website called carhire0000 .
2	the car_hire company hertz would not let_me have the car as they claimed i was not on the electoral role .
2	i am and i voted in may .
2	however this is not the problem .
2	the problem is that the traveljigsaw website carhire0000 will not refund me .
2	i had no service from them .
2	it has_been a month and they still have my money .
2	the website did not tell me a credit_card would be required .
2	after paying and completing my booking ( by debit_card ) i was told a credit_card would be required .
2	i rang up and had this confirmed by a member of staff .
2	since i do not have a credit_card i asked to cancel the booking and have a refund .
2	i was told i was not allowed a refund .
2	i had to work had to persuade the staff_member to let_me speak to a manager .
2	he said someone would call me back .
2	they did not .
2	i rang up again an_hour later and spoke to a different member of staff .
2	this time i was told i would not need a credit_card too pick_up the car .
2	i went_ahead with the booking .
2	however , on picking_up the car from hertz i was told i was not on the electoral role so could not take the car .
2	i voted in may 0000 and am on the electoral role .
2	i rang up hertz for a refund but they cannot help .
2	i was charged by carhire0000 on 00th_november and have yet to receive a refund .
2	make_sure you are on the electoral register if you plan on hiring a car .
2	they don_'_t tell you this is a requirement before collection .
2	no refund yet .
2	total timewasters .
2	they lure you in with a low price then make you view add on after add on until the price is 00 times what you expect .
2	don_'_t bother with them .
2	ordered last_week and paid extra for 0 day delivery .
2	we are now 0 days on and items still not arrived .
2	customer service line has now been engaged for over 0 hour as my auto dial service redials every 0 mins .
2	the ' on - line tracking ' doesn_'_t even give any clues .
2	discusting service .
2	on calling and discussing with paypal they adised me they had recieved numerous_calls regarding escapade today !
2	!
2	customer service is is a misnomer , no interest in service or facts .
2	every email ends ' we consider this matter closed ', and if you provide reqired proof they just stop replying
2	i found the p0g web_site very easy to use , just put in the source and destination postcodes , enter the dimensions of the parcel and all the options appear .
2	prices vary widely but so do the offerings .
2	my parcel was picked_up from my home on the requested day and delivered within 00_hours .
2	once it had been collected i was able to track it all the way to delivery .
2	can '_t think of anything_else you would need .
2	never have a problem finding what i want , there is always a large range to choose from and the prices are comparable with or better_than other_sites .
2	products usually arrive in a couple of days using standard delivery .
2	buying an annuity was never something i had thought about until the last few_years before retirement when our company scheme was finally closed_down and pension investments switched to a savings fund .
2	this meant that by the time i retired i had comparatively little in my account and did not really know how to proceed , but i never got the feeling that i was in anyway a minor customer .
2	my options were explained_clearly and i believe that the annuity obtained for me represents a very good return on less_than three years investments .
2	the actual procedure of taking a lump_sum and passing the remaining funds to an insurance company was very straightforward , i simply filled in a few forms and age_partnership did the rest .
2	som aftalt , til_tiden ..
2	i have to say i found shopto . net an easy site to navigate .
2	finding what i wanted to order was very straight_forward .
2	also delivery of my order was very quick .
2	over all i am well impressed with the service and would definitely recommend it to anyone .
2	it was great service and i ' d use them again
2	great service , delivery
2	good computer , exactly as_described , came quickly and easily , with email_updates on progress .
2	no_quibbles
2	i found cyclystore . co . uk while_searching for a supplier with the topeak defender xc00 front mudgaurd in stock .
2	most everywhere_else were back ordered on the factory , meaning 0 to 0_weeks wait ... but not cyclestore .
2	the xc00 was in stock and available for immediate delivery ; o )
2	i rate my first experience of their service as :
2	" cyclystore . co . uk deliver a five_star service .
2	they offer an easy to use website , keen_prices , excellent customer service with fast and efficient delivery .
2	my order was delivered with in a couple of days , well_packed and arrived in perfect_condition .
2	i like nothing better_than receiving a first_class service , which leaves me just to say – you are now on my list of top suppliers on the web .
2	thanks ’
2	as a new user , a bit_hesitant at first but the whole_process was simple from_start to finish .
2	0nd time use my parcel delivered in 00_hours and tracking_system is great .
2	well_done & thanks .
2	definitely this is the way for me now .
2	post_office has had it .
2	when we do on - line shopping for groceries we have used tesco and always had a good experience .
2	don_'_t do it very ofetn because we prefer to brouse .
2	however , use them regularly for wine supplies .
2	good wine at very good prices .
2	look out for the half - price deals .
2	dealt_with so eay blinds twice so_far .
2	once for perfect fit venetian_blinds for my house and the second time vertical_blinds for my sons flat .
2	the service is fantastic , delivery is fast , quality is good , price is excellent and the customer service ( i asked a lot of questions before & after purchase !)
2	is second to none .
2	i '_ll be back again and will recommended them to everyone .
2	top_marks from me 00 out of 00 .
2	if you every want to have your eye vision corrected , this is the very best clinic in the uk .
2	the staff are friendly , the location is perfect , 00_minutes from euston_station .
2	the procedure i chose , following a comprehensive 0 hour examination was to have " blended_vision ".
2	in effect , one eye is lasered for short_distance , and the other is lasered for distance .
2	both my eyes had stigmatisms , and my prescription was about 0 .
2	it took about 0 months for my brain to adjust , and now i have 00 00 in my distance eye .
2	it was the best thing i have ever done , and i have no requirement for glasses , 0 years in .
2	if you are going to consider eye treatments , the london_vision clinic is the only one to have it done
2	looking on their website and easy to use .
2	i bought a pair of calloway mittens for less an £ 0 , + postage .
2	thank_you
2	i viewed the tennis_nuts on line brochure and i was very impressed by the choice on offer , the quality of manufacturer and not least the very competitive_prices .
2	i bought a squash racquet for my son , i was really pleased with the ease of ordering and they kept me in touch with the progress of my order .... and i was able to track the delivery which in my case was a next_day delivery .
2	so well_done tennis_nuts i most certainly will be ordering through yourselves again .
2	derek timmins - jones ( toastmaster )
2	very easy to use , excellent directions , very quick payment .
2	simple to find your phone and you know instantly what you will receive .
2	they do not ship , they stall , they keep emailing dispatch notes but no goods arrive .
2	i do not believe there is an office at the published address i think calls are handled at a home
2	i have used national several_times for oil_change with filter , both at guildford and at rehill branches .
2	- great value for money
2	this site attacts visitors because of its low_prices , it passes you through to amazon and earns affliate commissions on anything you subsequesntly buy - on amazon_marketplace .
2	low - cost postage , low - cost product ( after checking several sites ); delivered next_day , well_packed .
2	perfect .
2	have to admit - was a bit_apprehensive using non - proprietary cartridges , but - £_00 for original v £_00 in this case , it was worth a try .
2	perfect .
2	very quick , including changing the delivery address mid - stream , well_packed , and cheap .
2	i have bought cheap before from better - known , higher up google ranks companies , and wasted time getting rubbish .
2	we '_ll be back .
2	i gave this company a hard time years_ago for poor service , but their prices were the best .
2	within a few_months it had the best services - as well as the best prices .
2	and they sell lots more than they used to - i got a great 00 " telly ( elonex !?)
2	for less_than £_000 - which was even more surprising as it was two years_ago .
2	best picture i '_ve seen , and still going_strong .
2	keep an eye on their more unusal items .
2	like i said ....
2	best options , best coverage , best service - and now good , informative business web - site .
2	just want them to lead the way in getting international calls and data costs down .
2	amazon is my preferred vendor as its reviews / searching , and its mobile version , are so easy to use ( too easy !).
2	the one fault i have with them is their inability to select a specific carrier .
2	i - and plenty of others - refuse to use hdnl ( or yodel ), but on speaking to amazon - who are very courteous and understanding - they cannot get out of using them specifically .
2	all i can do is avoid the free one - day option , and select free 0 - 0 business day service , which is usually post .
2	delivered late - on valentine '_s day .
2	never answered the phone to respond to query .
2	never responded to e_- mail for 0 - 0 days , and even then never understaood the issue of delivering so late in the day .
2	i have been trying to get a refund on the 00 day terms of refund . customer service is hopless . and unhelpfullhave been misinformed about returning item to store . for refund . not straight_forward as led to belive wasted hours going back to store to get this refund , still trying
2	an absolutely excellent site to advertise on , and very reasonable advertising rates too .
2	the only thing that is quite obvious is that companies and services on netmums are reviewing themselves .
2	to find a genuinely recommended company or service on netmums click onto the reviewers ' names - if they have other netmums activity then chances are they are genuine .
2	if they have joined netmums to just make one review then be suspicious .
2	but for any business that is child or parent orientated then i think this is the best thing since the demise of the yellow_pages paper directories in the early 00 '_s .
2	i am reviewing the post_office here today .
2	never had any complaints with letter deliveries nor parcel deliveries before .
2	but setting_foot in wythenshawe post_office , manchester and having committed the apparent mortal sin of putting a couple of staples in a bubblewrap envelope i certainly would never ever go in there again !
2	so this is for the assistant_manager at wythenshawe post_office :
2	" hail mary full of grace .
2	.
2	.
2	amen " i '_ve said it ten times along with 0 our fathers and hope my soul has now been cleansed !!
2	:)
2	better_than what ?
2	better_than paying an extra £_00 for tyres at my usual place , better_than spending on petrol travelling to my usual place , better_than hanging_around a dismal waiting room or sitting on a wall waiting at my usual place .
2	love the power_tools - especially the pneumatic jack .
2	lee anderton first_class service .
2	see yall again :)
2	a place where the malicious can do serious damage to people '_s businesses without either proving who they are , what their motive is etc .
2	the sooner this is cleared off the world wide web and people start honestly using reputable sites like trustpilot the better .
2	pissedconsumer . com is on a par with some seedy sex sites , or other such highly obnoxious internet experiences .
2	i first noticed trustpilot after being asked to thumbs_up a service from someone by e_- mail .
2	i like this sort of site as it gives businesses chance to reply - unlike_some sites .
2	i have been a review centre reviewer for many_years , and like this too .
2	( i '_m not expecting trustpilot to edit that last sentence out ).
2	the problem with internet reviews are twofold - malicious on the one hand and of course , user manipulated on the other .
2	the appalling site pi ** ed consumer dot_com is an example of malicious garbage on the web and needs taking down !
2	perhaps trustpilot may act against these_people in the course of time (?)
2	yes , as long as trustpilot remains fair and alert to both consumers and businesses then 0_stars by me .
2	just looking at normans website and noticed they are on trustpilot .
2	not bought anything for a while , but always been very happy .
2	we bought a child '_s clarinet when our kids were at school , and 0000 i bought a yamaha p00 stage piano .
2	of course it must be easy to sell yamaha products , as they are so reliable and well made :) but this does not mean a supplier necessarily is good .
2	yep , 0_stars .
2	i have had a co - op bank credit_card now for many_years .
2	back in the old days they were throwing cheque books at me , and giving an unnecessarily high credit_limit .
2	i reduced my limit voluntarily to £ 0 , 000 .
2	this week i have a payment and security_deposit on an enterprise hire van declined .
2	guess why ?
2	because the co - op reduced my credit to £_000 .
2	no postal communication was received .
2	( how is it letters from other banks seem to arrive ok but not the co - op ?
2	it leads me to believe they were never sent in the first place ).
2	i am 00 years old , a property owner , with above national average savings .
2	so as far as i '_m concerned my credit worthiness is rock_solid .
2	or is it ageism you are now applying co - op ?
2	i wonder .
2	i understand the co - op has quite_frankly ended_up in the creek .
2	they are going to make thousands redundant .
2	i also personally believe they are restricting access to the extremely low rates they were offering me on this card compared to modern day rates , and this may have happened to many , many others too .
2	whatever the case i do most strongly object to submitting a card to a van hire company and having it declined and having to use my daily shopping lloyds card instead !!
2	my credit_limit was £ 0 , 000 .
2	i didn_'_t even have £_000 used out of this , and to top it all i pay regular amounts throughout the month by lloyds fast payment into the co - op to keep my bills down .
2	update november 00 : and here we are , coming up to a month later and no reply from co - operative banking .
2	need i say any more ?
2	my 0th year with easyspace .
2	i thought i ' d hit a major problem with this service .
2	thank_you easyspace for a satisfactory_conclusion .
2	paid £_00 . 00 for a mobile device web_page .
2	dead easy to set_up and so many ways you can utilise this .
2	i checked the price of the . tel address i wanted with a normal hosting company - it was £_00 for a year .
2	these_guys have given me hosting for an extra £ 0 .
2	wish them every success .
2	i '_m pleased anyway .
2	update_: september_0000 .
2	i won_'_t be renewing my subscription however as mine was a special_offer and the price has substantially increased ;) also hosting_companies like one . com have free mobile optimisation within their web building templates in any case .
2	i '_ve been on this site before but lost my password etc .
2	recently did another instrument review .
2	always pleased to add my experiences of working as a pianist since being a 00 year_old in the 0000s .
2	edited november_0000 for personal online security .
2	not concerning uk_pianos :)
2	i have been making websites for 00 years_now and have tried all_sorts of deals from us and uk companies .
2	i have two sites live with one . com and both perform like_clockwork .
2	i love the online web design programme , but i don_'_t use one . com templates , i start from scratch and design my own still using their webcreator programme .
2	i don_'_t use cloud or e_- mail - but what i do use is very , very satisfactory indeed .
2	have only used live support once and found the one . com employee both patient and knowledgeable .
2	thanks - tony .
2	update september_0000 : still think one . com is the best provider on the planet !
2	not too thrilled with the new templates and the old system no_longer being an option , - so i just use a serif programme instead .
2	one . com is an entirely different world to some i '_ve tried - believe me !
2	updated november_0000 : reason = personal privacy online not concerning one . com
2	where '_s trading_standards when you need them - this company needs removing from the internet so no one can place any further orders with them as they are clearly not honouring them but pocketing the cash .
2	i am in dispute with them via barclaycard for £_000 where they took my money when the goods were discontinued and have not refunded after multiple attempts / methods of engagement .
2	does anyone know the owner '_s details to bombard him with complaints ?
2	this was my eight photo_book delivered and produced to the same high_quality standard as per previous photo_books .
2	the book captures my family holiday_snaps in malaysia ( kuala_lumpur and sabah , borneo ) and is a great way of ensuring a beautiful memories are presented in a beautiful way .
2	the paper , photos and overall quality of the book is superb , with prompt delivery all facilitated through an easy - to - use tool .
2	the fact that i was able to capitalise on a 00_%_off offer makes it even greater value .
2	i am off to canada next year and will ensure i continue to store and present my family holiday_snaps in these beautiful books as a great legacy for my 00 - year_old daughter .
2	i am very happy with the product .
2	quick & efficient !
2	honestly , it was so easy .
2	from filling out the form & quickly receiving all the stuff to send
2	the phone back , to receiving the payment in my bank within a few_days .
2	fantastic service !
2	i would certainly recommend mazuma_mobile for a
2	well_organised service .
2	great customer service , great prices and a 0 year_warranty .
2	if only all the other_companies could_learn from dv000 . com .
2	i will have these as first point of call from now on .
2	i have sent over 0 emails regarding my bills and yet to have my billing rectified .
2	0nd february_0000 and no bills provided since october_0000 a total_lack of support and no way to run a company , i have tried everything to sort this issue but no help from the company .
2	now seeking_legal_advice totally fed_up
2	very fast delivery within days of ordering , and they inform you approximately what time they will deliver .
2	the deal on my speakers was £_00 less_than amazon and you can check - out via amazon payments .
2	this gave_me the confidence to shop with an online company i wasn_'_t familiar with . i wouldn_'_t hesitate to shop_here again , soon !
2	really quick delivery , within a few_days of ordering . i would recommend this shop to anyone .
2	needed small mailing boxes to mail our products .
2	we found what we wanted and at an excellent price too .
2	package arrived next_day .
2	we are a happy customer and will be buying again from rajapack .
2	very fast service from the happy_puzzle company .
2	we ordered the the clock kit and i know our_grandchildren will have great fun making it .
2	more_importantly , a catalogue arrived with the clock and we were amazed at the vast_range of puzzles and games on offer .
2	all seem very good value and i am sure they will provide a well of gifts for future special occasions .
2	highly_recommended .
2	i needed to move 0 items of furniture a short_distance .
2	i had one quote dut the days did not work out , the seccond quote worked out and things couldn_'_t have been better .
2	repeat order - great choice and fast delivery
2	easy to chose , quick delivery .
2	will use again
2	after a short time taken to reply to an email , i had confidence that i was ordering the item i wanted , so many models and choices
2	good advice , competitive_prices and fast delivery .
2	very impressed with ease of contact and ordering , shame not all internet companies are this efficient .
2	bought two lots of heating and some insulation_boards , best prices i could_find and good service .
2	helped_me with what i needed and my heating kits were delivered next_day as promised .
2	electrician said better quality than he gets from his supplier .
2	whisky has had to go on the streets to make a living .
2	perfectly decent malts have had to put on mickey_mouse costumes and invent exotic backstories .
2	this is because they have to appeal to overpaid wannabees who cling to the belief that the purchase of overpriced externals can somehow provide them with the taste , discretion , culture and dignity they so conspicuously lack .
2	ok , that '_s the way the world is run nowadays .
2	when my local shop - and their wholesalers - stopped_stocking my favourite ( blended ) scotch , i went on a google_search .
2	to my surprise , the whisky_exchange still stocks it at a very reasonable price .
2	not only is the price good , but the delivery is impeccable and very fast .
2	they also take amex and give quidco_cashback - what could be better ?
2	needless to say , i '_m now a regular customer .
2	this is a model online business and deserves to prosper .
2	shame about the rich idiots who make it possible .
2	try and look beyond the marketing to the decent stuff underneath - you won_'_t regret it .
2	i have used " holidaysplease " several_times and found them to be very helpful in tracking down the best deals to suit my holiday requirements .
2	a much smoother experience than i expected .
2	the communications between etyres and myself were superb , and the whole_process was very well_organised .
2	thanks !
2	!
2	our orders are always on time , delivered by helpful and polite couriers .
2	wonderful service time and time again .
2	thanks littlewoods .
2	a very happy customer : 0 )
2	we visited the outlet shop in person on a 00 mile_round_trip and was made to feel very welcome by georgia who gave_us great service finding all the right products that we were looking for .
2	so we went back there the next_day to buy some more equipment .
2	the diving mask i bought developed an unusual problem when i tried it on again at home and i was offered an immediate replacement or refund with an_apology , no_quibbles .
2	i fully recommend this wetsuit_outlet .
2	zazzle is a great site they have a lot to pick from .
2	we are giving out our stickers next week i am sure the kids will love them .
2	we are doing a christmas , breakfast program for special needs kids .
2	all the kids have given us a wish_list from santa .
2	so the kids will receive their present and a little goodie bag as well .
2	easy pleasant_transaction , will be using for my foreign_currency from now on .
2	if you are looking for a quality company , with quality top products like this samsung_galaxy duos then look no further .
2	however you do need normal size sim_cards not the micro ones or an adapter .
2	battery_life is excellent just what you would expect from samsung .
2	no need to take two phones every time i go out any more .
2	and only one bluetooth_headset when i am driving .
2	all items ordered came on the day requested .
2	great customer service and top quality tools .
2	just what you expect from a quality company .
2	the class of a good company screams out every time you order from these_guys .
2	your goods are almost here the minute you complete the order , immediate e_mail confirmation and dispatch .
2	they are in my favourites , and will be for a long time to come .
2	i had ordered a new galaxy_s0 three_days ago , no phone as yet , i have e_mailed them on 0 occasions no reply , i tried_phoning the 0000 number , on hold for 00_minutes no reply .
2	i went through nectar for the extra points .
2	do not use this company .
2	i have reported them to nectar
2	never win on this site .
2	somebody ........ or the boss at ladbrokes ........ is a wealthy person , i never met a winner ........ ever
2	packed in and forgotten about .
2	no_problems , just a brilliant all_round service
2	i buy and sell on e_bay and any_problems i ever had , have been dealt_with in a professional_manner
2	tesco , as you would expect has an exemplary customer service and in my view , a far ahead leader in that field
2	gardens0less is a great site for some of the greatest deals you could hope for , supper_fast delivery and great customer service .
2	but
2	if the site would allow you to open an online account it would save all the hassles of entering all of your details everytime you purchase from them .
2	that one small item makes the web_site long behind the times .
2	great service .
2	nice to have someone on the end of the phone who_knows what you want .
2	great price too .
2	brilliant service from_start to finish .
2	order was placed at about 0 :_00pm , chose delivery date ( ordered monday delivery day friday could have had thurs , weds if wanted ), on tuesday got a phonecall from ao who ran through my order and confirmed delivery .
2	tried to sell extra_insurance but not pushy and never pushed it .
2	said we had to be in between 0 & 00 ( we went for free delivery but you can get timed delivery but i wouldnt bother ) and said we would get a text_confirming day before delivery .
2	the text came saying delivery would be between 0 and 00 and drivers_name .
2	on day of delivery we got a call from driver saying he would be there between 0 and 00 ( see i wouldn_'_t bother with timed delivery this was just as good ) the delivery came at 0 :_00am ( driver got lost but that was his sat_nav ) they delivered the freezer gave instructions about leaving it 0 hours and left .
2	after delivery the invoice was emailed .

2	as i have paid £_00 . 00 for delivery i expect this to be method chosen .
2	until the table arrives i am unable to comment further on the service .
2	i purchased a universal vacuum brush from espares recently , excellent service , price and delivery .
2	having bought a canon zoom recently from park_cameras i can say i am so pleased with the price , service and speed of delivery .

2	i can '_t bear to listen to the incomplete information that constantly pours from this iniquitous company , they have taken trust that was built up over many_years and have totally abused it .
2	i would dearly like to know the real motives .
2	don_'_t believe anything that the bbc puts out , not even the weather report .
2	listen to as many other news sources that you can and try to redress the totally biased bbc output form your own ideas !.
2	that one star is only there because the trustpilot will not accept no stars .
2	daily mail knows_how to throw cats among pigeons , they certainly seem to dislike the beeb .
2	and that '_s all - right by me .
2	i now know that i am not the only one who doesn_'_t believe all the tripe about global warming .... ooops climate change .
2	i love love love , the comments on line section and people actually read my comments and respond , boy am i important .
2	i only wish that when the red and green arrows are used , that the total numbers of yeahs or nays could be recorded instead of the balancing effect that the present system has .
2	long may it continue .

2	love the food , the palastri primitivo wine is habit forming and at the price it '_s a nice habit .
2	if i buy any electrical goods there is never the hint of a quibble should i have to return anything .
2	i have been with uncle joe '_s for almost fifteen_years_now , overall ..... unbeatable .
2	e_bay has served me remarkably well and saved me a considerable_amount of money , thus_far without risk .
2	mytyres was the only company anywhere on the internet that showed the almost_impossible to obtain sizes of tyre that i required .
2	before the eu got involved the sizes were available at a lot of outlets .
2	i was amazed that mytyres is based in germany and after a lot of soul searching i ordered the tyres over the internet using my credit_card .
2	two_days_later the tyres were in my possession to my great relief .
2	absolutely amazing service and remarkable prices , plus the fitters that they recommended were great and didn_'_t object to my not having bought the tyres from them .
2	i ordered a double_bass on a monday and they told me it would be with me the next_day ...
2	i thought yeah , right .
2	i can '_t get my mother '_s birthday_present to her that quick let_alone a bass ...
2	next_day the very tired postman was rining the bell .
2	goods all arrived safe and sound and everything was included .
2	great service .
2	thanks
2	brilliant service
2	great service , less_than 00_hrs from order to delivery , very impressed . good value and prompt service , what more do you need . will_definitely use them again .

2	found this company on the internet after receiving my projected annuity from my pension company .
2	i was dealing_with a very professional adam long who increased my yearly total by 00 %.
2	delighted with service .
2	mobile is just about acceptable
2	as instructed by a camerabox rep .
2	i returned a canon_camera & associated bundle on 00 / 00 /_0000 , due to them sending me an incorrect order .
2	i was instructed by them to take the package to the post_office , pay the cost of return postage and enclose the receipt for the cost of postage in the package , and they would refund me in full .
2	cost of return postage was £_00 . 00 .
2	when they made the refund it was for the actual cost of the items minus the return postage .
2	i contacted them via_email and got a reply from a person appertaining to be their returns manager ( some manager he is ) stating there was no receipt for the return postage in the package .
2	this was a downright lie because i personally put it in to the carton with a letter of explanation .
2	i then emailed him a copy of the postage receipt and have sent several emails for the attention of this manager , but so_far he has failed to reply to any of them .
2	i think their customer appreciation stinks and if i could i would rate this company as zero , but unfortunately the lowest score i can give them is a 0 .
2	i know this company has defrauded me out of £_00 . 00 and will never ever trade with them again .
2	i would urge any person thinking of buying anything from camerabox to really think again .
2	there are many far better websites out there who really appreciate your custom .
2	you have been_warned
2	booked on line for transfers from marco polo airport to mestre and then return 0 days_later to piazza roma to marco polo airport . pick_up at marco polo was simple and the driver courteous .
2	i e_mailed them to ascertain the exact pick_up point in piazza roma as i misunderstood the driver ( not his fault ) .
2	they replied straightaway with a google_map as well as the written instructions .
2	on the return i needed to leave earlier .
2	i rang and booked an earlier transfer without_any_problems_whatsoever .
2	i would definitely recommend sun_transfers .
2	prompt .
2	efficient service .
2	i ordered the wrong_size , needed a larger replacement and the entire returns process was excellent .
2	the tracking_information giving an update on my order was impressive .
2	after vauxhall pentagon trying to shaft me out of £_000 notes for 0 new front tyres , i was delighted when i was told about this new company .
2	i ' d just finished 0 night shifts and had booked online to have 0 new tyres_fitted on my day off with a saving off £_000 off the original quote :) .
2	andy arrived , his last job of the day , in all the ice and snow of the season and had it stripped down and refitted promptly , whilst i come round with my first coffee of the day ....
2	very professional service , with professional staff , and didn_'_t have to leave my house which is a bonus as it was freezing ....
2	thanks guys !
2	will highly_recommend to my friends and family !

2	arriving earlier_than planned did not cause a problem and we were promptly met in the short_stay orange car_park .
2	similarly , a 0 hour delay in our return flight did not cause a problem and our car was swiftly delivered to the pick - up point .
2	the staff were friendly and polite .
2	by far the best valet_parking service i have experienced at stn .
2	time for a new mobile_phone and intomobiles had a good offer for a samsung siii with orange .
2	placed the order on - line but no e_- mail acknowledging it .
2	tried e_- mailing the company but everything bounced_back by mailer - daemon - undeliverable quota exceeded .
2	eventually got through on the 0pence per_minute line and told to re - place order and that would be acknowledged .
2	did that but again no e_- mail response .
2	getting a bit_concerned_about a company with my bank / credit_card_details who appear uncontactable so wrote recorded delivery cancelling everything .
2	next , both orders are confirmed by e_- mail .
2	another letter sent cancelling .
2	next an e_- mail cancelling one order and confirming the second .
2	letters never acknowledged .
2	e_- mails bounce back .
2	telephone_calls left on hold for 00_minutes without an answer .
2	tried sending a message through the returns_form on the website but have no idea if it got through .
2	phone arrived but delivery refused .
2	almost two_weeks on and orange send me a letter activating the account and the direct_debit .
2	orange customer_services worse than useless - even gave_me the wrong number to contact intomobiles .
2	this has_been the worst on - line buying experience i have ever had .
2	i would tread with great care if you are thinking of buying through this website .
2	this i should have know a long time ago .
2	since i have to transfer quite often money from an to belgium , i am so happy to discover transferwise because it make a huge_difference at the end of the year regarding costs .
2	it '_s also a lot quicker_than by international banktransfers .
2	thank_you so much !
2	so simple , a good choice and eventually a good experience .
2	i put in my order for a washing_machine , chose free delivery for the day after next and paid .
2	i got a phone_call from ao shortly_after offering me a superb warranty which ( most unlike me because i hate warranties ) i snapped up .
2	i was also offered the machine ' take away ' service free , instead of ten quid , which i also took up .
2	delivery times were advised , which were ok but on delivery day i was given a short delivery time - slot and the delivery driver '_s name and contact number .
2	' billy ' my delivery driver kept me in the loop_regarding the time he would arrive and when he did he bought the machine in , took the old one out , rescued the trapped wash load that had prompted the new buy and cheerfully went on his way with his_mate .
2	nothing not to like .
2	if ao can do it , why can '_t all the others ?
2	i will be returning to ao when i need another appliance .
2	phoned up marks and had a chat to one of their staff , who couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
2	i told_him i needed the item next_day , guaranteed and he said no problem .
2	he explained that i ' d get a text / email from about 0pm that evening giving me a two hour delivery time - slot , which i got and , hey_presto , the following_day i got a call from the delivery van giving me twenty_minutes notice of their arrival .
2	well within the time - slot i ' d been given they turned_up , put the machine exactly where i wanted it and cheerfully went on their way .
2	i was happy , they were happy ; no more to say apart_from ' thanks marks_electrical you ' re the daddy !
2	bought last years specialized crosstrail limited for £_000 . 00 less_than this years price . mike mcconvey was very helpfull . had problem with brakes but specialized gave_me a free upgrade . also thanks to hargroves at winchester who assembled my bike and dealt_with the brake problem .
2	i ' d like for you to pass on this message to your senior director / manager .
2	although i am not a big customer of pmc , i have found your service and technical_support to be excellent .
2	worth a christmas bonus to your staff , sir , i would say ?
2	best regards sean dougall .
2	p . s i can buy your product from amazon cheaper but if i want to call for advice , paul conway knows_his stuff .
2	that is worth a few extra quid !
2	order placed on 00 / 00 /_0000 : delonghi magnifica esam0000s coffee_machine
2	received coffee_machine and after a telephone_call with delonghi i was advised to return the item as it was obviously faulty .
2	i completed the return procedure but was unable to print the voucher .
2	i have emailed to ask why it is not possible to open the voucher and have received no reply .
2	today is the 00 . 00 . 0000 - i guess i will not be enjoying a cup of coffee any time soon !
2	in light of the non_existent customer_care i will not be requesting a replacement but a full_refund .
2	i will not be purchasing from pixmania in the future .
2	this is my update .
2	yes , i am waiting for webcreation_uk to have this negative_feedback removed , how increasingly predictable .
2	to all those people left with an unfinished website , my commiseratons .
2	i am in the same position .
2	however , i can confirm that not only is there an online petition , a government body will now investigate .
2	so good luck to all you unlucky people who have come in contact with this comapny .
2	updated review 00 . 00 . 00
2	this review is from a confirmed client !
2	invoice number 00000 and invoice number 00000
2	my full name appears with this review and i am more than happy to share my experience with this dreadful company .
2	a new low for this company !
2	updated review 00 . 00 . 00
2	i confirm that i understand that it is illegal in the uk to write a review about my own business , or to write a review that is false .
2	are webcreation_uk aware of this ?
2	my experiences with this company are well_documented along with many many other dissatisfied_customers .
2	it is a real blow to discover that every negative_feedback listed on this forum against webcreation now states that they are from unconfirmed clients .
2	surely everyone is aware that before listing feedback all customers must provide invoice numbers .
2	is this yet another ploy to discredit their unhappy_customers ?
2	take_responsibility webcreation_uk and stop blaming everyone_else for the amount of online negative_feedback .
2	why take the risk when you can buy genuine usb_sticks at great prices - my sandisk 00gb cruzer blade arrived next_day in retail packaging .
2	i wouldn_'_t hesitate to use again .
2	i had some expensive hugo_boss frames which hadn_'_t been used much so when i needed some reading_glasses to help with small_print / low light levels i looked at a few websites to see if my existing frames could be fitted with new lenses .
2	the feedback for ' reglaze my glasses ' was excellent so i requested their safe to send pack and sent off my old specs .
2	a couple of weeks_later i now have my new reading_specs for a fraction of the cost of new designer_frames from the optician .
2	i would not_hesitate to use reglaze my glasses again - excellent quality lenses and brilliant customer service .
2	no need to throw_away perfectly good frames - just get new lenses !
2	!
2	when you have to spend around £_000 for 0 new tyres you tend to do some_research .
2	blackcircles offered the best price so i ordered and paid for the tyres online and got an email confirmation of the tyre_fitting at a local_garage only a couple of miles from home .
2	i agreed an actual time for the fitting with the garage and the tyres were fitted and i was on my way home again within an_hour ............ perfect !
2	!
2	i would recommend blackcircles without_any hesitation .
2	excellent quality - lightweight but very warm .
2	don_'_t pay ' brand ' prices when you can get goose down quality for the price of a feather based duvet - the difference is amazing .
2	best price , low shipping and fast delivery .
2	highly_recommended .
2	own_brand turbo yeast and spirit flavours highly_recommended .
2	i found the item i wanted , the price was very competetive , paid online and took delivery the next_day .
2	00 / 00
2	not booked with lowcostholidays before , just searching through , gave it a go then did same search with other_companies this was very competitive price so gave it a go booking was straight_forward and easy .
2	emailed all the confirmation and all my tickets etc .
2	just the flight tickets to print once they are released , has to be less_than 00 days before holiday .
2	at this time i can say i would use them again .
2	purchased a pair of merrell_boots a christmas_gift , arrived really quickly excellent communication from rubbersole , checked on arrival all looked fine , when opened and tried xmas day there was a manufacturing_fault .
2	checked website re returns , very simple process dropped_off boxing night email following_day that parcel received , further message processing the exchange and just had message that replacement on the way .
2	no_fuss , no_messing_about just fast prompt resolution of a problem , can '_t fault buying or aftersales at all .... excellent will_definitely use rubbersole again and recommend to family and friends .
2	we have two desires and a wildfire in our_household on the 0 network been really pleased with the phones easy to use excellent features will have to be pretty amazing phones to get me to change from htc when contracts renew .
2	i have used this company a few_times now and they are consistently excellent .
2	really quite good .
2	great item at a great price
2	you can '_t go_wrong shopping on line ,
2	there '_s everything you need in your littlewoods catalogues
2	and flexible payments makes it more easy on your pocket
2	then trying to find the money all in one go .
2	plus the bright side is that you get some money back on commission .
2	00 out of 00 for littlewoods .
2	i placed an order in the evening of 00 december ( boxing_day holiday ), and the goods were delivered to me on the morning of saturday 00 december !
2	notwithstanding the great prices and wide_range of stock , to process , despatch and have the order delivered in the space of less_than 0 days is nothing short of a seasonal miracle !
2	i never use anyone_else for my guitar supplies and this has just reinforced the service level that we all expect yet so rarely experience .
2	i would not_hesitate to use uttings again and would definitely recommend them to anyone .
2	excellent service from this company again .
2	placed my order and get an email with delivery day and wait for it to arrive .
2	marvelous .
2	have just recieved my second purchase from gear0music and the service is exellent and fast delivery
2	this is the second time i have placed an order with glasses_direct and i was so pleased with the service and price i will_definitely use them again .
2	i cannot recommend them highly_enough .
2	thank_you glasses_direct .
2	frank toohey
2	i just wanted to say how impressed i was with their service .
2	i ordered my used lense on a thursday_afternoon and i received it on friday mo
2	ing .
2	the item was well_packaged and was received in very good condition as_described on their website .
2	i used the lense over the jubiiee weekend and had very pleasing results .
2	i will be buying from mpbphotographic again and will recommend the company to others .
2	a very big thank_you to mpbphotographic .
2	very clear online ordering_process coupled_with very fast delivery at a great price all means that i will return to pdh_sports for my next sporting purchase .
2	this has got to be the only place for audio_leads .
2	great price and super_fast delivery .
2	excellent service , price , and delivery .
2	i would have no_hesitation in using this company again .
2	i have been a member of my local costco since it opened many_years_ago and i have been a regular customer and a huge_fan .
2	two years_ago i would have given them 0_stars without_hesitation .
2	recently however i have found their pricing much less competitive , so much so i am beginning to question if my membership is value for money .
2	for example :
2	books are cheaper on amazon ( with free delivery )
2	cameras are cheaper in pc_world and argos
2	pcs are cheaper in pc_world
2	many foods are cheaper in asda .
2	many white goods are cheaper on line without the hassle of arranging your own delivery , installation and disposal .
2	once you could almost take it for granted that if it was for sale in costco then you were getting the best price .
2	sadly this is no_longer true .
2	costco '_s buyers need a wake_up call .
2	it is all to easy for consumers to find the best price available .
2	it seems that they costco are just too slow to react to price fluctuations in the current fiercely competitive retail environment and if they carry on they will lose out on membership .
2	i only gave this one star because zero_stars is not possible .
2	why do computer manufactures bundle a trial version of the mcafee " anti_virus " software ... answer .
2	because mcafee pay them to do so .
2	i will never again buy a computer with this pre installed .
2	it is , in my opinion , total over priced rubbish that can '_t be removed once your " free " updates expire and thus prevents installing free anti_virus alternative software .
2	vote with your wallets guys , dump this software and don_'_t buy a computer with this already installed .
2	we should be able to decide ourselves which anti_virus we want on our computers not mcafee .
2	an executable file that cannot be removed = virus ...
2	think about it !
2	i '_ve just joined and immediately posted 0 reviews .
2	i love the idea of being_able to feed_back on companies from one place .
2	i hope they all take notice of this site .
2	power to the consumer .
2	indispensable !
2	i never book any hotel without checking this site first .
2	it must be single_handed responsible for raising the bar in the service industry and preventing consumers form making costly mistakes .
2	my first two buys from tesco direct went very well .
2	great price , very easy web_site and excellent prompt delivery .
2	well_done tesco .
2	i have been using tune up utilities for many_years and have found it great value for money .
2	every thing works great from initial trial use to the upgrade of each version and daily use .
2	i have never had one single error_message .
2	i use the 0 licences on the three machines in the house and i think i get at_least a couple of extra years out of each machine just by keeping them all in a clean and healthy condition .
2	over the years i have grown to always accept the recommendations with full confidence .
2	i have just upgraded from 0000 to 0000 .
2	i only wish it would help me permanently get_rid of mcafee " anti_virus " so i can install something of my choice .
2	sjekka nettet for svart nato - genser , og valget falt på gameon !
2	fra bestilling_til produktet var hos meg gikk det kun få dager .
2	anbefales !
2	i placed an order for a bed that was advertised as available for immediate delivery for next_day .
2	after confirmation the bed did not arrive as indicated .
2	got a an e_- mail saying someone tried to call me and the order has_been delayed and they will be in touch with regards to a new delivery date ( i checked my phone no messages or missed call ), so this was lie .
2	a few_days_later after receiving no response i chased world_stores only to be told that the item was not available ( despite it being still advertised on the website ) and a refund has_been requested .
2	it has_been 00 days since order was placed and i have received no refund .
2	they are quick to take your money ( despite the item not being available ) but are not prepared to do a refund very quickly .
2	i wonder_how much money they make from customer in this way ?
2	following good recommendations on cost and quality from several family_members , i decided to order items from the cartridge people and based on my experience so_far , it will not be the last time .
2	although it may seem a little strange it is how they handled a problem which has most impressed me so_far .
2	just before easter i ordered a set of 0 ink_cartridges .
2	they arrived very promptly but unfortunately only 0 had been delivered .
2	i emailed the company the same day and got a very rapid_response offering apologies , accepting they had made an error and indicating the item would be sent out immediately .
2	true to their word the missing item arrived this morning , again in very quick time .
2	at some point every company will have odd problems and it is in the way they deal with the problem which separates good companies from the rest so i would give this company 0_stars for quick response , accepting the problem and dealing_with it effectively .
2	i feel sure problems are a rarity but it is nice to know that if they happen you can_rely_on the supplier to sort things out .
2	so along with good quality cartridges and very good prices they also have very good customer service .
2	my thanks to birgit at cartridgepeople for sorting things out .
2	i needed a 0gb_memory card for my now slightly aging dell_d000 to bring it upto the max 0gb the model supports .
2	finding the right module on the site was extremely simple and gave confidence that i was ordering the correct unit .
2	before purchase i checked with a number of other online suppliers and found mr_memory to be either cheaper or at_least competitive with other_suppliers so decided to go_ahead with the purchase despite never having used them before .
2	although i opted for the free delivery which can take_upto 0 days , i received email confirmation that the order had been dispatched the day after ordering and the package arrived the next_day , so excellent service .
2	in terms of quality the memory_module included instructions on fitting and works_perfectly as you would expect , passing a 0hr memory test without_any_issues .
2	overall , good prices , quick delivery , good product .
2	i will no doubt use this company again and just for the record i do not work for the company and have never had any dealings with them prior to this purchase .
2	i have to admit to have been concerned_about dealing_with a " web_presence " based on the other side of teh world .
2	however , through conversing with filippo on the live_chat , i gained confidence from his professional and prompt handling of my enquiry , so i placed an order .
2	besides thge obvious concern about whether the goods would arrive , i was also concerned_about possible damage in shipment as i ordered a large kitchen_appliance .
2	i shouldn_'_t have worried , because standard of packaging - a large wooden crate - was the best i have ever_seen by an international shipper .
2	the goods arrived in good time , in perfect_condition .
2	i would recommend fesal to anybody as being a first_class company to do_business with .
2	i joined first_utility because of their advertising the roll out of ' smart_meters ', two years later and they have now stated that the roll - out is not going to happen . my rate was changed to a different rate without my knowledge and despite providing online meter_readings my bills are still being estimated , attempted to contact them but am getting an_automated_reply_stating ' due to an unprecedented level of interest , responses are taking longer_than usual - we will do our best to respond to your enquiry as quickly as possible .
2	currently this may take up to 00 working_days ' poor , poor service - avoid at all costs
2	what more could you want from a parcel delivery service ; easy to use site , competetive postage rates that dont change when you go to the counter to post your item , and they collect from your door , so you dont have to scout out an increasingly_rare post_office , and stand forever in a queue a mile long , and then get stuck behind someone sending_parcels to several relatives across the planet who cant make up their mind which service they want , and listening to inane conversations and piped music .
2	life is too short and this makes my life much_easier .
2	[_external_reference_] have lost me as a customer .
2	many_thanks to [_name_] for his information and help .
2	keep it up
2	site simple to use , goods in stock , delivery fast and efficient ..
2	difficult to ask for more , so i won_'_t .
2	many_thanks
2	great service - contacted me to help me better understand my product choices and options .
2	kept me updated with availability and delivery .
2	value orders were small to cyberselect ( at_least i hope they considered them small !!
2	:-), but their attention to detail couldn_'_t have been better .
2	i received the same care and attention on the two_separate_occasions i did business with them so it would seem their processes deliver their customer service intent .
2	give them a try .
2	it appears to be a good policy but the proof is in the pudding .
2	how good are you at settling claims without haggle ?
2	i would like to see some reviews from customers who have had to make claims .
2	they should be the first thing you see on your web_site .
2	another small thing is that you say you have frozen prices since last_year but despite the loyalty_discount i still paid about £ 0 more than last_year .
2	how come ?
2	the loyalty_discount is almost an insult .
2	00_% would be a more realistic amount .
2	as i say the product appears to be good but i hope i never have to test your claims_procedure .
2	i just want to thank_you for the prompt and very satisfactory response to my problem .
2	i received a replacement heater on monday as arranged .
2	an excellent service .
2	well_done .
2	thank_you very much indeed .
2	kindest_regards
2	douglas goldie
2	just great prints at a price that does not brake the bank , speedy , well_wrapped and never dissapointing .
2	i love_em .
2	easy web ordering with competitive_prices & delivered very quickly .
2	quick delivery , excellent prices - perfect !
2	i wanted a nikon_d0000 , digital_rev stood_out as best value - bit of a shock when i found they were hk based , but i was staggered when the camera arrived in 00_hrs ....!!!
2	!
2	camera is perfect , i have a fine supply of bubble - wrap .
2	happy , happy

2	having seen an installation done by quickslide and visiting their factory , we fell_into the trap and ordered windows and doors for our home from them .
2	after more than 0 months , substantial damage to our home , mess and weeks of delays and frustration they still_haven_'_t finsished .
2	the original installation was quoted to be 0 or 0 days but 0 months on and it still isn_'_t finished .
2	the company has over promised and under delivered on just about everything .
2	hugely disappointing and we are on the brink of handing the whole_thing over to our solictors .
2	we wish we had never_heard of quickslide .
2	we had a hotel booked to be able to attend the commonwealth games in glasgow in july_0000 .
2	we booked and paid in full in october_0000 .
2	in march_0000 we are informed by hoetelsclick . com that our booking is cancelled .
2	they are still selling rooms on their website for much higher prices than we paid .... now we don_'_t have a hotel in glasgow because there is nothing available except for super hyper high prices because of the commonwealth games being on ...
2	if you are ever tempted to use hotelsclick . com - just don_'_t : they are liars and cheats !!
2	!
2	this site allows you to gain reach and give a good range of possible tenants without loosing control through the use of agents .
2	this was my second order from the chocolate_trading company and both_times the chocolate has_been packaged very well and delivered quickly .
2	this time i ordered the white chocolate roses to decorate my daughters_birthday_cake and they are absolutely_stunning .
2	i will_continue to order from this company and will recommend to all my family and friends .
2	thank_you very much i will be ordering again and again i think that is all i need to say
2	just used the online_chat service and found it to be excellent .
2	i was chatting with kirsty and she managed to answer all my questions very good !
2	they bring in a secure key card and you have to use it or you get basic internet access .
2	i can '_t even send a secure message to them .
2	without the secure key i have to call them to set_up any new payments , that i believe is fair_enough and did just that .
2	i then had them transfer some monies to it .
2	i believe that was all i would have to do and then any future payments i would do online as per normal , but no apparently , all payments to these new people will have to be done over the phone .
2	this is ridiculous , every other bank only asks that i do it on the first payment to a new account / person etc .
2	i don_'_t want a secure key pad for every account i have , i would need a suitcase to carry them around with me .
2	why can '_t they do like santander where they confirm via a text_message to my registered mobile_phone .
2	if i lose my phone i call them to cancel .
2	the whole_experience was great .
2	website easy to use and the delivery was very prompt .
2	will use again .
2	many_thanks
2	thank_you for a straight_forward and easy transaction .
2	product does as_described and company delivered rapidly .
2	just taken delivery of spares for my 00year_old mira mixer_shower .
2	national_shower_spares had a parts in stock , including up - dated mixer_valve replacement , and all the ancillary plastic parts , which together with a new shower_rail and head , with help to install easily available on - line , gave_me a brand_new shower that is a joy to use for the cost of the parts alone .
2	great service from this company for order of vip pedals .
2	ordered within 0_weeks just before_christmas 0000 , and they came within the week .

2	recent family visit manchester to malaga , very comfortable with exit seats on the outbound_flight ( at no extra_cost !)
2	sadly when booking i inadvertently skipped the option to choose seats for the return flight so we were split up .
2	the kindness of another passenger allowed_us to sit together .
2	we have previously used jet0 and based on that and this flight , i very much doubt we will use another airline , unless it was significantly_cheaper .
2	i would be prepared to pay a small premium to fly with jet0 in the future .
2	having recently_upgraded to iphone 0 '_s , my family used mazuma to recover some of the cost by recycling our old_iphone_0gs '_s .
2	the whole_process was quick and painless .
2	i did use special delivery and increased the insurance_cover , but the phones arrived_safely , and the payment was made within hours .
2	it is so good to have this level of customer service with an online service ; something which so many companies seem to ignore these days .
2	i also used topcashback and got a small extra payment from them .
2	highly_recommended as a first stop for technology
2	i ordered a blackberry_playbook .
2	it took 00 days to be despatched ( compare this to amazon and virtually every other online_retailer with same day or next_day despatch ).
2	when it arrived it was clearly an american import because it had an american 0 - flat pin power adaptor .
2	when i queried this they asked me to send a photograph so the matter could be referred to the right ‘ department ’.
2	then instead of supplying a uk charger they sent me an adaptor for a uk three pin , but refused to send it to my home address insisting it had to go to the work address to which the playbook had originally been sent .
2	this despite the fact that i was off work for three_weeks .
2	i then discovered a problem with the play book .
2	it would not ‘ talk ’ to my computer when i plugged it in to the usb_port .
2	the playbook would ‘ see ’ the pc but the pc said it was an unrecognised device .
2	i contacted blackberry support who could not have been more helpful , and with their assistance ran through a whole series of checks and tests , including using other pcs , and re - installs of the pc desktop software .
2	nothing worked so i went back to simplyelectronics and reported the problem .
2	they told me to send the device back , which i did by special delivery with guaranteed delivery by 0000 on the monday .
2	it took 0 days , and two nagging emails from me to acknowledge the playbook had even arrived .
2	two_days_later their engineers informed me there was nothing wrong with it .
2	i challenged this .
2	they repeated the assertion .
2	i asked them to return the item .
2	four days_later i received an email_saying the item had been despatched .
2	the next_day i went on line and discovered the courier company had attempted to deliver the item two_days before that email .
2	eventually i went to the depot and collected the delivery myself .
2	when i plugged the playbook into my pc , to my surprise , it connected – once .
2	they the same problem recurred !
2	i wrote to simplyelectronics asking them to replace the playbook .
2	they simply told me to return the item to them .
2	there was no way i was going through that again , so i took it down to my local vodafone dealer .
2	they discover some minor_damage to the contacts in the usb_port , which they seem to have fixed – hopefully it will stay fixed .
2	i bought from simplyelectronics because they were cheap but the saving was not worth the hassles .
2	the quality of photo print on mugs is excellent .
2	this is the 0rd time of having unique mugs printed and certainly use again .
2	received quickly and well_packaged .
2	i have now had several orders from northern_parrots and each time the service was without_exception first_class .
2	ordering is easy and delivery is prompt .
2	will_continue to use this company .
2	booked a return transfer from dalaman_airport last month . faultless on both parts of the journey .
2	tickets turned_up on time , no_problems , would happily buy from them again .
2	i had the need to order a di box and after comparing between a few internet retailers i decided that gear0music would probably get the order .
2	very easy bask / checkout facility , no problem at all in creating an account with them .
2	in fact , since i used to work at a very large etailer i commend gear0music in getting the balance right between simplicity and capability .
2	order late on a tuesday_evening ( item was in stock ), order status progressed as anticipated and then whilst i was at work on the wednesday i received a text_message_stating it had been despatched and to log in to track the delivery .
2	no need to track it really , it arrived as promised the next working day - delivered 00 : 00 by the courier .
2	arrived in perfect_condition so all i need to do now is wait_till the next band rehearsal and it '_s all systems go .
2	i suppose the question is , will i be ordering from gear0music again ?
2	absolutely - just need to wait for a decent excuse to positively , completely , and utterly want / need something else ( or at_least a way to persuade my wife it '_s a worthwhile purchase !)
2	if gear0music keep_up this sort of performance then i have no_hesitation in recommending them , i do realise that a single purchase is not_necessarily giving the complete picture - but first_impressions count !
2	i '_ve always had great service and responses from all the staff that i have had contact with in woking over the years .
2	emma who is now based in kingston , has_been absolutely splendid in booking my trips , and on some famous occasions , re booking them !
2	cooker and hood arrived right on time
2	the confirmation slip said that amner oils would make the delivery but it was in fact emo oil who did so , i have not heard of this company before .
2	i have since been informed by boiler_juice that emo oil is a subsidiary of amner , but i am still a little uncertain_about reassurances concerning quality .
2	website well_laid_out , prices to suit all pockets with a delivery service second to non .
2	staff very pleasant when contacted .
2	informative , pictures of treads and explanations of the tyres , easy to tyres sizes using the registration_number and i can '_t find anything cheaper .
2	offers a useful discount on mots
2	what can i say but that it was so easy to order what i needed and the prices was very good , checkout via_paypal was quick and easy and the delivery was fast , i would really recommend you to buy from pet_supermarket ,
2	i ordered the wrong model part and i realised just after that i had made a mistake , a quick email to shower_spares and they replied very quick to say they would send out the other with a returns_label for the one i ordered , items arrived in good time , i would recommend them to anyone_needing spares for their showers , if i ever need a shower spare again i will 000_% use them to supply , :)
2	prompt delivery , excellent feedback , soundmagic_pl00 earphones great product .
2	thank_you .
2	was promised delivery in 0 days , took 0 after making enquiry .
2	i bought sennheiser cx000 earphones the sound is terrible , did some reserch on the web , they are fakes , much worse the standard ipod plugs which are supposed to be cheapies .
2	please beware lot of fakes out there .
2	reading_reviews on here i have no chance of refund .
2	this was the second time i '_ve_used mazumamobile .
2	this time returning a phone that wasn_'_t working_properly .
2	same great service .
2	what i love about mazuma is from the website through to you receiving your money , the process is very simple .
2	they keep you up to date via e_- mail as to what stage your order is up to .
2	no_hesitation in using them again in the future .
2	excellent and easy to use website !
2	!, best of all .... they are cheaper_than any other company for the parts i needed .
2	lightning quick delivery .
2	absolutely spot on !
2	if you have a good idea or project you '_ll find willing lenders at competitive_rates - and fast !
2	excellent system
2	fantastic product , friendly service nothing was too much_trouble it was explained to me in clear english with al the optional_extras that could be purchased at the same time or even later if i wanted to .
2	lots o choices of colours !
2	excellent information sheet in colour , the product was ready on time , i collected it as i was passing , couldn_'_t wait to get it home and fitted , and i was not disappointed .
2	and the dogs love it too !
2	i would get one for every car i have in the future well_worth it !
2	i needed some toothpaste for max who is a 00 year_old doberman with one iffy tooth .
2	the best one is logic and i also needed some worming_tablets , so i ordered them on monday and they were here by tuesday !
2	i have used viovet before and would recommend them to everyone , excellent prices and excellent service .
2	this is the second time we have ordered from this company , they really are fast for delivery and the work top is first_class , mark is a joiner and he always recommends them to his kitchen customers , and everyone is happy with the product !
2	i would use them again , and again .
2	so don_'_t delay get ordering now !
2	excellent service , ordered middle of 0 day , arrived and fitted by mid - morning following_day .
2	highly_recommended to anyone whos looking for an excellent service .
2	on behalf my firm i do alot of ordering on the internet .
2	of particular importance to me is ease of use of a web_site as well as price .
2	this is the first time i have used printerland and they passed those tests with flying_colours and when the goods arrived first thing next_day i felt they certainly justify the 0_stars .
2	will use again and will recommend .
2	love this i never need to leave bed except to answer the door
2	love this site i get to be a sexy chick and win every time
2	as long as you have a bit of flexibility with dates and cruiseline you will always get a deal .
2	have used 0 times when it waz cruisevoucher and now have 0 more cruises booked through cruisemiles no_hassles and helpful
2	got on a 0 day on the summit southern caribbean , most amazing islands service was best ever and food too and we got cruise using our cruisemiles so cost was minimal
2	sometimes i like peace but i tried carnival through cruisevoucher for next to nothing and was very surprised how good service and food was
2	no cheaper way of gettin cruiseing now they took ove cruisemiles . com and got all my friends using it
2	found celebrity cruises much_better value for money and nicer shp
2	i booked through cruise . com and the cruise was cancelled and they said it was because i was british
2	how did we eat etc before these sites cuts the crap out of hotels resturants etc
2	hate foreign airlines we have the best so support it
2	call_centre morons you won_'_t get anywhere if you have a problem
2	but hate looking through catalogues
2	use to be good now it '_s biased rubbish run by idiots
2	prices take the proverbial and often full of kids
2	you hide i seek but i find ya with google
2	look no further my son it '_s like step toes yard grab a bargain my boy
2	why get out of bed when they deliver it all lovely
2	i needed four new tyres so called the guys i '_ve_used for years and looked at all the usual_suspects .
2	i found blackcircles using a search_engine and immediately felt_comfortable with the site , it '_s easy to use , informative and offers a great selection of top and budget brands at a glance .
2	i chose the tyres for me based on reviews and my usage and booked in for fitting .
2	the fitting_center was only 0 miles from work so i ducked out at lunchtime and job_done .
2	the fitting_center was excellent , polite , professional and quick service .
2	look at the website clearly - did you see the bit about the glasses taking 0_weeks ?
2	- no just as well that you ' re not in any hurry .
2	i ordered my glasses and received them in 0 separate lots .
2	the first pair ( transitions_lenses in a half frame ) fell_apart in under 0 days .
2	it '_ll take another 0_weeks to get another pair , by which time i '_ll have been on holiday for ages .
2	" once we receive the glasses , we will contact you to explain the cause of the fault ," - yadda yadda yadda - they were poorly put_together - no explanation necessary - rubbish quality doesn_'_t have to be " explained ".
2	just as well you can get a pair in a couple of hours on the high_street - which is where i suggest you go as_opposed to getting rubbish service and useless goods via the web .
2	i did ask customer " services " if there was anything that could be done to expedite a properly built pair but my impression was that they couldn_'_t care less .
2	well , while i was away , the replacement glasses appeared .
2	this time the new lens was attached far too loosely so that there was a clear gap_between frame and lens .
2	both lenses were badly smudged with grunge as if the operative had spent the lunch hour changing the oil on their car without washing their hands before bodging a pair of glasses together .
2	back in the post - let '_s hope it '_s 0rd time lucky for this lacklustre bunch of amateurs .
2	i recently_flew with my wife and adult daughter from newcastle to corfu .
2	we had booked one large suitcase for the hold but on arriving we were generously offered the opportunity of stowing our hand_luggage in the hold for free , this we took them up on .
2	very good !
2	we were also pleasantly_surprised by the amount of leg_room and the modern aircraft which didnt set out to freeze you to death or have you gasping for oxygen .
2	all in it was a big_thumbs_up from us .
2	jet0 is the only airline willing to take on flights from newcastle to new_york too , albeit in november / december - i ' d love to see this extended to other times of the year , i bet they ' d be fully taken up as it '_s a real_pain having to transfer via heathrow or schipol - sounds_like a good reason not to have a 0rd runway at heathrow to me .
2	thanks quidco .
2	in just over 0 years i have received nearly_£ 0000 - just by checking if ' normal ' online purchases could be purchased through_quidco , home & car insurance , mobile contract etc .
2	even been paid for recommending to friends & family and using price / insurance comparison_sites .
2	for anyone making online purchases registering on quidco is rreally a no - brainer .
2	register - you will not regret it !
2	i was quoted a good price for two lenses ( sigma 00 - 00mm hsm and 000 - 000mm os hsm ) in one order .
2	i placed my order on thursday_lunchtime 00th_october , 0000 and tnt delivered on tuesday 00th_october , 0000 , at 0pm .
2	whilst i have not thoroughly tested the lenses as yet i am very pleased with the results from some quick shots and that they are in full working order .
2	digitalrev will be my first_port of call when looking for my next purchase .
2	clear & easy to operate web_site , accurate parts search , and fast delivery .
2	quality products , very helpful staff .
2	i have been dealing_with contract hire_companies for over 00 years and my experience with central_contracts was first_class ... great communication and the overall service was excellent .. would recommend
2	luliana was a great help , brilliant service
2	extremely_helpful support , and they produced very professional easy to manage dynamic looking website .
2	they answered my queries promptly .
2	i also received a progress report at the end of each week which highlighted any outstanding actions .
2	would certainly recommend them to anyone looking for a professional web_site
2	unionjackwear . co . uk
2	ordered 0 sets of earphones that were never delivered , sent loads of emails but was only told there was a problem and slight_delay ?
2	groupon just said that as they had been sent by their supplier un - recorded they could ' nt do anything .
2	i '_ve lost my money by the looks of it .
2	very poor company to deal with and i won_'_t be using them again ................
2	i would be more than happy to purchase from toolcentre . co . uk again .
2	great service , great price plus clubcard_points what more can you ask for .
2	this company in my experience always deliver when they say they will .
2	i have never been let_down .
2	this is a top_rated company .
2	i '_ve_used this company on a number of occasions now and never_fail to be amazed by the speed at which they deliver the orders - every one so_far has_been dispatched from germany and has arrived quicker_than the british counterparts .
2	excellent service - highly_recommended .
2	excellent service , fast & efficient , very competitive_pricing - best on the web !
2	can '_t fault the service and exchange_rate .
2	i easily found the correct_part and ordered it , simples .
2	p . s i am an enginneer thou .
2	have been waiting for an important delivery from dpd and would like to share my experience .
2	day one , was sent an email_stating delivery window of 0000 - 0000 .
2	left work early and lost money to get back on time .
2	got home at 0000 and went outside to leave a note on my front_door to say , could they use the back door but there was a missed delivery note already there .
2	no time was on it so i used my phone and checked the tracking_details .
2	still was saying " out for delivery " kept refreshing it ontil at 0000 it changed to say that they were unable to deliver as nobody was in !
2	why send a delivery window if your going to be early ?
2	day two , email again saying window of 0000 - 0000 .
2	got home at 0000 .
2	put up note again , turned on outside lights and waited .
2	kept refreshing tracking until at 0000 it said unable to deliver as nobody was in !!
2	rang them and managed to get through to a person ( by putting in an incorrect calling_card number ) told them the situation and hey claimed the driver had gone to the wrong_address .
2	i called this into doubt as it was the same package , same address , same driver ( daniel ) and i live in a small village with nt many properties .
2	person said they would get the driver to turn_around and try again .
2	i said great i would go outside and wait on the drive so the driver wouldn_'_t miss me .
2	00_mins later i called back but they had no record of my earlier call and no message had been sent to the driver .
2	i wasn_'_t happy .
2	i got all the details from the person i talked to the second time and they were very apologetic but it wasn_'_t helping_me much as they said it was too late to turn him around now .
2	it '_s now been arraigned for tomorrow ...
2	i '_m not hopeful .
2	i order lots of things online and by far the worst service i have received by a courier , is from dpd .
2	i find it hard to believe that i '_m not being_lied to as none of what i '_ve been told adds up .
2	if they had a truly local_depot i would have gone and got it but a round_trip of 0hrs is a bit much .
2	please give me my package
2	recently i bought a continuous ink supply system ( ciss ) from 0000rpm .
2	on opening the packet i found blue ink everywhere .
2	the cyan ink drum had been damaged in transit .
2	contacted dale at 0000rpm who sent a replacement ciss by first_class post .
2	just installed today and works_fine .
2	thank_you for the great customer service !
2	from_start to finish an enjoyable_experience .
2	i have been a customer of reidys for many many_years , and would visit their shop in blackburn when ever in the area ( luckily i was a regular_visitor to radio blackburn / lancashire and managed a lot of visits and purchases lol ( there goes the fee again ).
2	nowadays i shop on - line a lot more , and whenever i see a new " toy " errr piece of essential musical_equipment - i search the internet for reviews and prices and then last on the list reidys , yes last !
2	because i know their prices will be great ( and will price match ) but most of all their customer service is one of the best , always helpful and informative , and all communication efficient and friendly keeping you up to date with the process , this is then continued by their choice in carrier services dpd who inform_me the day before the package will be delivered , then sms me on the day , a 0_hr time_slot ( and gps tracking on line of where my item is and expected delivery time ) the combination of these two companies makes the whole_process of making a new purchase and getting it in your hands , the enjoyable_experience it should be , second only to the real_life experience of visiting the shop : d
2	i have no connection with reidys ( although i '_m always treated_like a friend or family_member ) and have nearly 00 years experience of purchasing and playing a range of musical_instruments and accessories .
2	many_thanks to staff ( past and present ) at reidys
2	- and in those immortal words " i '_ll be back "
2	easy to use , cheap , really good company , would use and recommend again
2	it was all easy to order and great for them to tell us the day it would be delivered .
2	excellent service !
2	wonderful service - and speedy delivery - parcel was delivered the next_day
2	excellent after_placing order with fast delivery - thank_you
2	could not get a ticket anywhere for andre_rieu for my wife '_s birthday_present .
2	needed good seats as it was a special birthday (!!)
2	so i went through to the ticket agents .
2	i ' d never used agencies before and i was a little_dubious , having heard of so many scams etc , but i checked up on double0 and they had good reports .
2	i knew that i would be paying more than face value ( it is very clearly_stated ) but i went_ahead .
2	i was very pleased to get the tickets next_day with a friendly hand_written note saying " hope you enjoy the show ".
2	the tickets were for 0rd row seats right at the front .
2	absolutely perfect .
2	well pleased and i can recommend double0 to anyone .
2	we decided it was time to replace some of our old furniture .
2	having already bought some oak chairs and a dining_table previously , we wanted to match them .
2	we went on line and found , amongst_others , oakfurnitureland .
2	after comparing products and prices we decided to go to the local_branch of oakfurnitureland to check on the quality of the product .
2	this was excellent , with 000_% oak ( no plywood or veneered chipboard ) and a heavy_weight and a faultless standard of workmanship .
2	what is annoying is the stupidly inflated " was sold at and is now " price labels .
2	this is a permanent sale with this company , so don_'_t be taken in with the " savings " to be had .
2	look at the actual price and forget the " was " price .
2	it is still good value for the product quality .
2	we bought a dresser and a bookcase and a cabinet and got a free 0000mm_x_000mm mirror .
2	this was at 0pm on a bank_holiday monday .
2	very helpful and knowledgable salesman .
2	on our arrival home i had an email asking me to contact them for a delivery date .
2	i do object to companies using 0000 numbers for you to contact them so delivery was arranged by text for a few_days time .
2	very pleasant_young_lady in the transport dept phoned and confirmed and the lorry_driver phoned to confirm when he was 00_mins away .
2	very pleased .
2	goods arrived on time and were very well_packed .
2	lots of cardboard to dispose of , though , but goods undamaged so that did it '_s job .
2	easy to use website .
2	decent prices .
2	000_% availability of stock .
2	really quick free delivery .
2	they do it every time i order .
2	great !
2	recommended .
2	it was farmore than i expected .
2	what a relaxing week .
2	my wife and i hope to do it again .
2	called back within 00_minutes . very impressed . lady was very efficient and helpful .
2	thank_you .
2	orderded a b_grade st guitar as a backup and practice for my strat . it arrived this morning . very impressed . it was advertised as having scuff_marks on it and was reduced to reflect this . opened box , very well_packaged . took out guitar , could only find one slight mark on it . plugged in tried it . lovely tone and sound . even as i am a drummer i appreciate good sounding gear and this sounds as good as my strat which cost me a damn sight more !!!
2	well_done g0m . great service and good quality . i hope when look at your drumkits i get the same service . thanks .
2	steve clark .
2	so_far so good but my purchase hasn_'_t been delivered yet ?
2	the order status on my order has changed to ' picking '.
2	what does this mean .
2	excellent service and prompt delivery have already_recommended to friend and they have already ordered goods .
2	i will buy again and i '_m very happy with my little set .
2	my only claim is that i ask the tracking nb without_any success .
2	the only reason for my request is that i dont trust the french post .
2	but thank anyway darren !
2	ps next time i will buy the minilava !
2	this was the second order from 0000rpm after a well_packaged first order .
2	i was not disappointed with my second order .
2	i had a call from the courier telling_me what time the delivery would be and he arrived on time with another well_packaged parcel .
2	i ordered 000 slim dvd cases for a really cheap price along with 000 datawrite titanium printable discs , some ink and some other odds and ends i needed .
2	only 0 of the cases were damaged on one corner which is pretty good as i have had much worse from other_sellers , and remember these cases were cheap ones not the more_expensive brand_name cases .
2	one of the packs of datawrite titanium dvd - r discs were faulty as you could see errors in the dye when examined closely .
2	0000rpm quickly replaced the discs and refunded my return postage .
2	these two faults were manufacturer failings but 0000rmp customer service were polite and behaved in a very professional_manner , i have no_reservations recommending 0000rpm and i will be ordering from them again soon .
2	good packaging , low_prices , fast delivery , excellent customer_services .
2	well_done 0000rpm 0 ***** from me
2	i purchased a £_00 . 00 zyxel nsa000 nas box from dabs . com on the 00th_november .
2	i did not pay extra for the express delivery and instead went for the cheapest option .
2	what a surprise when royal_mail delivered it recorded only 0 days after ordering .
2	i had been having problems with the unit for a week and after lots of testing i decided the box must be faulty so i emailed dabs . com .
2	lauren got back to me within 00_hours and offered a full_refund and said i could return the item and they would reimburse me the postage or they would arrange_collection .
2	as i browsed the web i found several people had similar problems and had different_ways to fix the problem so i tried several options , some of which seemed to work so i kept the item .
2	over the christmas_period i never used the box but when i set it all up again in january i had the same problems again , so i contacted dabs .
2	i expected the " you should have returned it to us " or " contact the manufacturer " but no .
2	lauren was sorry ii was still having problems and has arranged for the item to be collected from me and is going to issue a full_refund , not a credit like some on - line stores .
2	i fully_intend to buy a replacement from dabs . com especially after the service i have had from them .
2	lauren in particular has_been helpful , polite and quick to reply to my emails .
2	i have no_reservations_about recommending dabs . com to anyone .
2	i too agree most people only leave reviews if something_goes_wrong
2	update_:
2	my parcel was picked_up on time .
2	i was informed it had been received and within 0 days a full_refund .
2	i am about to reorder from dabs . com
2	thanks for sorting this out lauren and dabs
2	i did order a new zyxel nsa000v0 nas box , and only paid for the cheapest delivery option , but it still arrived only 0 days from placing my order .
2	once again well don dabs 0 ***** service
2	highly_recommended
2	this was the first time using 0000rpm . com
2	my items were easy to find and the prices were very good value .
2	checkout was just as simple and paying with paypal was a bonus .
2	i was surprised at the postage_costs because i was expecting it to be more_expensive or delivery to be a week .
2	but no next_day delivery was only £ 0 . 00 for all my items .
2	i was informed about the process of my parcel , even down to the hour of delivery and the driver '_s name .
2	now usually when ordering cheap dvd cases you expect a couple of damaged or cracked cases , but these were good quality , and very well_wrapped , 000_% perfect .
2	all my inks and blank discs were also very well_wrapped and arrived in perfect_condition .
2	overall my experience with 0000rpm . com was excellent and i recommend anyone to have a look at their web_site , you will not be disappointed .
2	i will be using them again in future 0 *****
2	well_done 0000rpm
2	this is the second time i have brought from w . o . p .
2	and i would recommend them to everyone .
2	i had a small problems with a compressor '_s air hose leaking .
2	this was sorted_out quickly and a replacement was sent within a couple of days , by a very polite and professional customer service lady .
2	the second item was a barbecue side burner .
2	customer service sent me full details of the burner so i could make_sure it would fit my different make of bbq .
2	the result is i have upgraded my bbq with a top quality outback side burner for only £_00 .
2	what a bargain .

2	i ordered my 0000 xbox_live points from gamesbite .
2	i had an immediate order conformation and less_than 0 minutes later my code arrived .
2	no_problems adding them to my xbox_live account .
2	highly_recommended and will buy from again
2	note : i think the reason people have codes rejected or marked as invalid is because they buy them from a different country other than their account is registered in .
2	you can '_t always tell where you are buying from .
2	my pond_pump arrived less_than 00_hours from ordering .
2	i saved a few_pounds and i am_delighted with the pump .
2	i recommend alton_garden_centre very highly to everyone .
2	fast delivery , cheap prices , what more could you ask for .
2	fast efficient service will use again
2	pedal on has one of the best selections of clothing and accessories .
2	they get what cyclists need and pricing is always among the lowest .
2	immediate delivery and everything in good order .
2	impressive follow_up by email to check if all ok and giving personal contact details to refer to if any problem .
2	excellent customer service .
2	i would really recommend serenata_flowers with out any hesatation the service they provide is second to none the flowers are really really good
2	well_worth the time .
2	good deals on top companies .
2	always prompt service .
2	my mistake in ordering was dealt_with almost immediatly .
2	alternative product arrived by return with no postage charge .
2	first_class .
2	cheap but too
2	many extras
2	ryanair were far too forgiving of the passenger who kept marrakech to edinburgh flight 00 00 . on the tarmac for an_hour .
2	it missed its slot and i had a large taxi_fare as a consequence . empty any hold_luggage , let them stew .
2	there were no_problems .
2	one query was checked out and responded to quickly .
2	my beloved shield sunglasses got cracked in a bag as i raced across london , so i needed a quick replacement .
2	came_across sunglass junkie after visiting a few other_sites , and just got that feeling it was good - reviews confirmed this .
2	only one pair of shields available , but i liked them .
2	they arrived yeaterday , and i '_m pleased indeed .
2	just like the clear , large photo at their site .
2	quality manufacture , and symmetrical .
2	great for the current weather , and my forthcoming hol - if i sit on them on the aircraft , i '_ll know where to come_back to for another pair .
2	everything_went_smoothly with this company .
2	the price was the lowest and their website showed other_suppliers ' prices ( accurately ) to prove it .
2	delivery was promised within two working_days , and this was honoured down to a three - hour_timeslot , with several texts to let_me know the driver '_s progress .
2	the washing_machine was well_packaged and courteously wheeled into my garage .
2	in fact , the only delay has_been mine - installing the damn_thing .
2	i was surprised at how easy it was to use the superdrug doctor service , it seemed to ask the right questions and make the correct determinations for the products i required .
2	ordering_process was fast and secure , collected the product 0 hours_later from my preferred store , staff were very professional during the collection process .
2	i can '_t complain_about any_aspect of this service !
2	i cannot_believe the bbc have sold out regarding the coverage of formula 0 .
2	this surely will reduce the appeal to new and old audiences alike .
2	i am new to formula 0 and found the coverage fantastic .
2	why don_'_t you listen to the thousands of fans and spend money on this fantastic sport that promotes everything that is good about human achievement rather_than some boring drama .
2	i had a parcel delivered yesterday and was even pre_- advised ot the hour they would arrive .
2	true to their word the arrive smack in the middle of the hour .
2	i think the people like me that have a great experience should shout louder ather than just rely_on those who moan and moan and moan .
2	excellent products that speed up workflows and are completely idiot_proof !
2	!
2	absolutely fantastic and would recommend to anyone serious about their work .
2	as i live in maidenhead i opted to collect the lens myself .
2	i was met by a very helpful & enthusiastic guy_who gave_me a quick run through on the lens in question which was the canon_ef 000 - 000_f0 . 0 - 0 . 0l is usm .
2	i used it to capture the rally cars on the rallye deutschland .
2	it performed_brilliantly .
2	returning the lens was just as easy & a couple of days_later received the all clear on the returned lens .
2	i will_definitely be taking_advantage of their services again & have no_reservations_about recommending them .
2	i bought a set of shimano gear shifters from merlin .
2	i ordered them on monday and they were in my hands on wednesday_morning , how '_s that for quick delivery !
2	the price was the best on the internet , and i did a lot of searching ......
2	i '_ve_used merlin before and i wouldn_'_t hesitate to use them again .
2	i '_ve_used better_bathrooms twice_now and have been more than satisfied with the service they provide .
2	the two suites i ordered were easy to view on the website and ordering was a piece of cake .
2	the delivery company they use arranged the delivery for when i wanted it .
2	i did have a problem with one of the items i ordered , but i found their customer service was exceptional , and better_bathrooms sent out a replacement part straight_away .
2	moving to grimsby recently i have had the chance to find this place to look after my car , the service is efficient , professional and friendly , i have no_hesitation in recommending it .
2	excellent service , responsive communication and a genuine wish to give good service to customers .
2	a company you can trust ..
2	the only source of the excellent ohto multi slim0 pens and refills i know in uk .
2	unlike so many web retailers cult_pens respond personally to emails .
2	service fast and efficient .
2	excellent range of pens and other writing and drawing instruments .
2	highly_recommended .
2	i purchased a royal robbins men '_s travel vest for holiday travel .
2	by the time i discovered the faulty stitching on the garment i had left on holiday so could not contact webtogs for two_weeks .
2	i had also thrown_away all packaging and lost the order number .
2	on emailing webtogs about the faults , they rapidly responded by email with follow_up phone_call and have undertaken to replace the garment without_any argument of fuss .
2	it is good to have a rapid and personal response from an online store .
2	had a bad_experience ordering from wae_+ two asus pb000q 00 " wqhd led - backlit monitors ; they took my money , promised me two_weeks delivery and after 0_weeks i had to chase a refund .
2	in the meantime , i found pcbuyit , ordered the same monitor and it arrived at 0 : 00 the very next_day .... outstanding !
2	having ordered the ' wrong product ' which was my fault , i returned the transformers to uk electrical_supplies .
2	they sent the correct transformers by return of post , which now work perfectly with the led_bulbs i also obtained from them , and they gave_me a refund for the difference without_delay .
2	who could ask for more ?
2	goods dispatched as requested and delivered in a timely_manner .
2	after my comments on here i swiftly received a call from o . f . l .
2	apologising and offering to make ammends to the way i was treated by there p . r customer team .
2	a new table leg was duley dispached and an engineer fitted it yesterday .. my table looks stuning now and im over the moon with it .
2	id like to thank alex preston for his help and phone_calls , he did a brilliant p . r .
2	job and totaly restored my faith in o . f . l .
2	i can only hope valuable lessons have been learnt by o . f . l . s telephone cutomer relations team and that this dosent happen again .
2	after all i still think o . f . l .
2	productsvs are top_notch value for the money and theres_nothing_compares on the high_street .
2	!
2	would wholly recommend !
2	cannot_fault mazuma again ..... competitive price received along with excellent service
2	paid evans for an estimate for accident damage after crash .
2	forgot to do it first time and had to go back a second time and pay for cab both_times as bike was unrideable .
2	i trusted their estimate and got money from insurers for a new frame and eventually got around to buying a new one .
2	when i came to rebuild bike i removed the bar_tape and found the £_000 set of carbon bars had snapped almost clean through leaving me £_000 out of pocket as it was too late to claim .
2	when i contacted evans for an appology they refused to beleive me and said the damage must have been caused while the bike was stood in my house waiting to be rebuilt .
2	its nice to know that they are willing to risk customers lives by not carrying out basic checks such as checking for damage under bar_tape after an accident .
2	if the frame was not cracked i would have trusted their judgement and cycled through london with a set of bars almost sheared through .
2	however to add_insult to injury they then accuse the customer of lying and blame them for the damage they missed .
2	avoid , avoid_avoid !!
2	!
2	i have bought 0 cannondales from this company and both_times have been more than pleased with the service and product .
2	the latest was a new road_bike which was nearly_£ 0000 off list price and hundreds of pounds_cheaper_than evans_cycles sale price .
2	i requested delivery on a specified day and they obliged even with just a few_days notice arriving at lunch time giving me enough time to unpack it and go for a spin on my day off .
2	the packaging is top quality with loads of extra bubble_wrap and loose parts cable tied and a few instructions on assembly .
2	the bike went together easily with only an allen_key set required and could be done by anyone with a bit of common_sense .
2	the only adjustment needed was the chain spotter which was rubbing slightly everything else was perfect and needed no adjustments before riding .
2	the only complaint that i would have is that when i tried to contact digitalrev i got a timeout error once i submitted my question , which was about ordering in a foreign_currency .
2	( it turned_out that my messages were actually sent and they were replied to within 00_hours .)
2	anyway , i ended_up calling the uk local rate call line and my question was answered very politely and informatively by the girl who answered .
2	i then went online , ordered my new camera ( a sony_rx000 ii ) on the saturday_morning and it was with me by monday_morning !
2	this is the third time i '_ve ordered camera_equipment from digitalrev to the uk and every time they '_ve been great .
2	keep_up the good work !
2	bought this dog shampoo from animed .
2	price was the best available on the internet .
2	delivery was quick also .
2	highly_recommended .
2	a +++++
2	wanted a cheap shed to use as a log store .
2	this met all the requirements at a keen price and quality .
2	i opted for the windowless variety , to get more storage for my logs .
2	i also bought the floor pack to strengthen the floor .
2	( all the extra weight !!)
2	lots of room for all my logs and kindling at a better cost than a dedicated log store .
2	we ordered and the item came through very quickly .
2	well_done !
2	!
2	wanted a daylight strip_light for a work bench .
2	struggled to find the correct one .
2	buybrand_tools were very helpful and supplied the correct one and quick delivery .
2	bought a mattress from this company at a good price , saved about £_000 +.
2	ordered on a sunday , delivered the following wednesday am as promised .
2	packaging was heavy_duty plastic x 0 covering , like a big pillowcase .
2	driver was very helpful .
2	all in all a first_class experience from_start to finish , would recommend .
2	have used this supplier for my camera_equipment for several_years_now .
2	their service has always been efficient and prompt , and their pricing keen .
2	i cannot recommend them too highly .
2	i '_ve recently had the pleasure of dealing_with matt and phillip at createmyplates .
2	they offer a very personal and friendly service ( to be expected as they ' re yorkshiremen !)
2	and are quick to respond to any emails or messages sent to them .
2	effective communication is a very important quality to me , many companies have flashy and expensive websites but sometimes you just can '_t get your message to the right person if you have a question , and very often you never receive a reply .
2	it was totally the opposite of this with createmyplates and i would certainly recommend them to anyone .
2	thanks for a great service and great product matt & phillip .
2	i '_ve been sending email enquiries to this company for a month in regard to one of their products , but they appear to have chosen to ignore me .
2	i won_'_t be bothering again and will simply take my custom elsewhere .
2	if a company won_'_t respond to a simple product enquiry then just imagine their attitude_towards a customer who had a problem .
2	i '_m sorry to have to submit the lowest rating so_far , but i must be truthful in my opinion .
2	i came_across the tradeworks website when searching for a specific 0 - way tv amplifier to replace one i ' d just broken in my motorhome .
2	my requirement ( for several reasons ) was for an identical replacement and there were several such items on the web including some cheap new ones on ebay , but i chose the tradeworks item as i could get it quickly and with ( or so i thought ) the 00v power_cable and adapter included .
2	the website said the stock quantity was " plenty ".
2	i paid extra postage to get the item quickly and it duly_arrived within a couple of days , however , when i opened the package i discovered that i ' d been sent an equivalent item of a different brand , and there was no sign of any power_supply cable or adapter , i wasn_'_t happy !
2	why wasn_'_t i contacted and advised that they didn_'_t have the correct item ?
2	had that happened i would have immediately requested a refund and gone elsewhere as it was an_urgent order , but now i have to wait several days for them to get the correct item back in stock and then send it out , and it '_s only an estimate when they '_ll get some more in stock .
2	the guy i spoke to on the phone was polite and apologised for the error , hence me awarding 0_stars instead of 0 !
2	as i said above their website stated that they had " plenty " in stock , which was obviously wrong , and i '_m not sure the correct item will come with the power_supply cable as the website doesn_'_t give any indication of this one way or the other .
2	online shop style websites that aren_'_t accurately maintained are one of the main_reasons i '_m still to be convinced that internet_shopping is more convenient , because i '_m now being inconvenienced by the delay .
2	i '_m sorry once again for giving the lowest rating so_far , but had the guy on the phone not been as polite as he was , it would have actually been lower !
2	have replaced my halogen and standard 00v filament bulbs on my boat to great effect .
2	given that traditional bulls are very ' hungry ' electrically , it makes perfect sense with limited battery power on a boat to use led_bulbs wherever_possible .
2	not only my navigation lights but also in the cabin .
2	on my first order i selected the wrong type of bulb but these were returned for credit without_any fuss and the correct bulbs ordered with thanks to the advice of the very helpful sales_assistant .
2	it is good to give praise where praise is due and in my case , praise for blt
2	is certainly due .
2	great service , great prices , great glasses .
2	not a lot more to say really .
2	if you need a new pair of glasses give this company a try !
2	easy to order and goods were dispatched quickly and delivered efficiently .
2	great service on this one !
2	maybe the last time ............
2	so we paid a fortune for hyde_park hospitality including seats .
2	viagogo receipt indicated row and seat numbers but no tickets in pack .
2	seller said just tell them at hyde_park ticket office , but they were not interested .
2	no ticket no seats !
2	great concert but could have done with seats as it was 00_degrees on 00 th july .
2	viagogo have been silent despite several emails and a poor response to their customer survey .
2	maybe this will provoke a response and preferably some recompense .

2	tony phoned me earlier in the day to see if i would be around earlier .
2	arrived and fitted 0 tyres in about an_hour .
2	did a great job with big heavy tyres with only a cup of coffee for sustenance .
2	will recommend tyres on the drive to friends for sure .
2	when i was let_down by one transporter shiply quickly arranged another within a couple of hours and this new transporter was great , punctual , polite and careful - well_done shiply
2	i bought a petrol_strimmer / brush_cutter last nov ( 0000 ) but on the third time out i rather over enthusiastically bumped the line feed spool and broke it .
2	oh well i thought it was very cheap and i doubt that the seller would keep spares but i phoned the seller and spoke , very quickly to a helpful young_man .
2	i was informed that the spool was available as a spare and i was helped to the appropriate web_page where i ordered the spool and paid for it .
2	the spool arrived very quickly by post .
2	as i had broken the spool i fixed the brush_cutter blade and that worked_perfectly .
2	fantastic piano and great service and delivery .
2	thank_you
2	ordered some beer i liked on recent_visit to germany .
2	it arrived next_day well_packaged . brilliant service will_definitely be making future orders .
2	the delivery driver was very good .
2	i am sure i could not have found a better firm to deal with .
2	all staff i dealt_with where friendly and always helpful they kept me well informed by telephone at every_step of the way . use them you will not be disappointed .
2	super_fast delivery just do `_nt know how they got the package out so fast and it did `_nt cost any more in postage .
2	top quality products good value and fast despatch .
2	will use again .
2	the item arrived on the day and time stated .
2	brilliant .
2	ordered a new washing_machine .
2	got it for £_000 less_than i could_find it anywhere_else , and delivered within a few_days .

2	brilliant !
2	brilliant service .
2	very friendly and helpful .
2	email response is quick and friendly .
2	i '_ll be using them again .
2	bought a rather fabulous food_processor from this company at a price that was without_doubt the best i on the net .
2	the item arrived in good time , despite_being bought over the ' difficult ' christmas_period .
2	my only_negative_comment is that when i called to try to get some delivery information , the woman i spoke to was very , how shall i put it , ' stern sounding '.
2	a smile in the voice always helps on the ' phone .
2	that being said , delivery was fast and i am immensely pleased with my purchase .
2	a
2	my first dealings with parcel0go and so_far my parcel hasn_'_t been picked_up .
2	it '_s been three_days now for a next_day collection .
2	the driver went to the wrong house and i '_m not very impressed .
2	0 - 0 is a very big window too ... lot '_s of waiting in the house .
2	however , the company '_s reputation is almost saved by the live help , very professional people , all female so_far , who have all been helpful , friendly and done their absolute best in a clear and efficient manner .
2	people like andrea today who instantly understood the problem , was intuitive about my dissatisfaction and made a beautifully timed upgrade gesture to smooth things .
2	these are the people on the front line so thank_goodness they are solid , it is so often not the case !
2	let '_s hope the driver can find my house now !
2	i can not praise the service enough , it was excellent .
2	everything from communication , web_site , delivery and most of all the excellent value for money on offical uk stock camera .
2	the added_extras like , expensive accessories , 0 year_guarantee , camera case and table tripod , included with a discounted price as well .
2	i '_ve purchased many cameras and camcorders from many companys worldwide and this has to be the best so_far .

2	so if i hear nothing further and dont receive product or refund then small_claims court and off to maplins .
2	this is a cowboy firm what the quote on line is not the price at the airport you think you have paid all the access but it doubles at the airport
2	good service and no_problems - what else is there to say !
2	i phoned to book parking as my computer was playing up .
2	the lady i talked to was very helpful and efficiently booked the parking i wanted with the repeat_customer discount .

2	replied to email enquiry very quickly .
2	competative price
2	shipped order promptly and kept us updated on delivery plan . with 0 hour_window
2	did a geat package deal for the boiler and accessories i needed and delivered next_day .
2	would reccommend to anyone who needs a new boiler .
2	tried a number of different companies and found this one to be the most competative and easiest to understand .
2	nobody does it cheaper or simpler .
2	using this company as as the booking agent is simple and straightforward and promotes enjoyment and anticipation of a great holiday ahead that can be looked forward too !

2	i have bought quite a bit of stuff from ebuyer , mostly pc related bits and pieces and components .
2	i once bought a graphics_card which i was having a problem with , and they dealt_with the issue most fairly and honestly .
2	ebuyer is my one - stop - shop for almost all my needs !
2	i have now bought 0 pc '_s from dino and all have been spot on .
2	would thoroughly_recommend as a supplier .
2	ordered buzz !
2	quiz world ( ps0 ) for a great price that was delivered quickly , exactly as_described .
2	just visited the showroom and immediately ordered a vega tv bed to replace the rubbish one that we bought from bensons ( seriously - don_'_t ever be tempted to go there ).
2	knowledgable about the products and have introduced some of their own innovative_features .
2	friendly and helpful , i really cannot_fault the service .
2	highly_recommended .
2	looking_forward to the delivery - after which i will review again .
2	so - i cannot_believe the service i have received .
2	our old bed was collected by ( the hateful ) bensons for beds and the balance paid to nestco for our new bed .
2	chris knew that we had been sleeping on the floor ( thanks bensons ) but had a delivery driver issue .
2	the solution if i could assemble the bed ( i can ) is to hire an extra van and deliver it himself late on thursday_evening .
2	thank_you so much .
2	i am so glad i had the opportunity to put this together as it meant i could compare it to the one from bensons .
2	seriously - there is no comparison .
2	the vega from tv_beds has a far_superior build quality , superb fittings and innovative_features .
2	even came with an hdmi_lead .
2	we will be buying a single tv bed for our son soon .
2	there is only 0 place we will go .
2	without a doubt , the worst company i have ever_dealt_with .
2	i have experienced significant quality issues with the sandringham tv bed that we purchased from bensons .
2	it took 00 calls for customer service ( hahaha ) to actually do something to address my issues .
2	note - they never call their customers back .
2	every call was initiated by me .
2	the engineer that they arranged to attend agreed that the tv lift mechanism was indeed faulty .
2	two_weeks_later and bensons hadn_'_t called following this visit - so rang them to ask .
2	they stated that they had the report but just needed to check on what they would do next .
2	we '_ll call you tomorrow .
2	a week and a half later with no call .
2	call them back to be told the bed is now discontinued .
2	my choices - wait_until june for the replacement .
2	have a refund .
2	i will have the refund thanks as i have had it with this company .
2	i will never buy anything from them again .
2	standard delivery , and arrived next_day .
2	no_problems , fair price , quick delivery .
2	job_done !
2	all of my dealings with this company have dealt_with professionally , and promptly , so i simply have only good remarks .
2	we live out of town , so this is easy to order on line and pick_up as you pass through the airport .
2	rate is normally very good , so another good reason for using this service .
2	made purchase for my daughter , called the day before delivery , answered straight_away and the person had all the details to hand .
2	delivery confirm as stated in my order and arrived well within the time_slot .
2	best price on the web or in shop .
2	would without_doubt use again .
2	buy with 000_% confidence as true 0_star_rating
2	looking for a set of wheel at a good price and certainly found them here , in fact over 00_%_cheaper and free p_&_p for the same item .
2	ordered sunday , shipped monday and in my hands by 00am tuesday , item was despatched with full order tracking , but beat me looking where they were !
2	very well_packed , so not to risk any damage .
2	very pleased with the way this order was dealt_with and would , or should that be , will use them again .
2	well_done scotby .
2	frankly i ' d have been quicker collecting my order myself .
2	over night delivery took a week and every tine i got in touch i was fended off with lies and promises that were always broken .
2	then to top it off another parcel from another retailer got the same treatment at the same time .
2	this has_been the fourth and fifth time that yodel have let_me down .
2	they said they couldn_'_t find me and that the parcels were improperly addressed .
2	this was not true they were correctly_addressed and in the week while i waited [_external_reference_],_[_external_reference_],_[_external_reference_],_[_external_reference_] and [_external_reference_] all made it to my door .
2	yodel are useless and i would never recommend them to anyone , ever !
2	i '_ve_used battery_force for a number of years , initially because they offered great prices , but i have since become aware that their processing , dispatch and delivery is fast and accurate .
2	i recently needed to source an unusual battery_charger , emailed them , got a speedy response and ended_up with exactly_what i needed .
2	overall , excellent !
2	do not use bravofly - total_rip - off !
2	they took my money and then couldn_'_t confirm the flight or provide a ticket .
2	no one answers the " all times " help line and they charge you for the call !
2	then i went to cancel the booking that they couldn_'_t confirm and they charge a " penalty " to cancel .
2	excellent customer service - good quality products .
2	seven months after having tried more than 00 solutions , " official_unlock iphone " could solve the problem and only in 00 days .
2	the treatment of the whole_process is 000_% transparent and reliable .
2	thanks for the simplicity and professionalism of your services .
2	searched for a device for my motorbike and they were by far the cheapest
2	review regarding a go pro hero 0 black motor edition ordered on the 00 / 00 /_0000 yes 0000 , not posted due to me mentioning one christian name who sent me an email and speaking honestly !, nonetheless less they still have my money and i , nearly 00 months later do not have the goods , come on proviation get your act_together and give me what is mine !

2	i have just purchased another panasonic_camera from them , the new tz00 .
2	i traded in my last years purchase and they gave_me a good trade in price against a good price on the new one .
2	holly is a real star and a credit to the company , she is very helpful and gets things sorted .
2	great delivery times too .
2	i will always use uk digital_cameras as should you .... i highly_recommend you to .. you won_'_t be disappointed .
2	just had the pleasure of buying another camera ( panasonic tz00 ) from them and trading in my used one .
2	cannot_fault this company at all .
2	easy and pleasurable transaction ... holly is a star ... very helpfull and a pleasant_young_lady .
2	great trade in price and great prices on new cameras too .
2	i will always use these_people and recommend you to do the same .
2	i am one very satisfied customer :-)
2	easy site to navigate and prices are great .
2	they definitely know their stuff .
2	i will always go to them for future_purchases .
2	very very quick delivery , and excellent prices .
2	definately a lot cheaper_than our local_vets .
2	i would highly_recommend vio_vet to everyone .
2	i found that they had the most competetive_prices , with a very quick delivery .
2	their site is very easy to navigate around , had all that i needed to see with all the relevent imformation .
2	i will_definately_use again and recommend to my friends .
2	i have only used hermes a few_times and i am pleasantly_surprised at how reasonable the prices are , i am confident with their reliability and i am impressed with how fast they deliver .
2	just like anybody_else who is moving , there was a lot to focus on . we were really fortunate to have booked these_guys . they were friendly and worked_tirelessly . i ' d recommend them to anybody !
2	i ordered and the order was processed and delivered superfast .
2	thoroughly_recommended .
2	this company has_been most helpful in identifying the required replacement_keys and thereafter their service has_been the best .
2	i am most grateful for their efforts .
2	easy to find the exact memory required , unlike_other_sites .
2	i have now used offtek about 0 times and each time the price and service has_been the best i have ever_encountered .
2	i will always use offtek in future and would recommend them without_any reservation to prospective_customers .
2	many_thanks for a great service .
2	the speed at which the searches are carried_out and the prices are unbelievable when compared with other web sites .
2	i will only be using this site for bookings from now on .
2	totally hassle_free - everything simple and as promised .
2	car to terminal and vice_versa a minute or less .
2	competitively_priced too .
2	easy to apply .
2	good level of cover .
2	quite_frankly it was daft of me not to obtain annual_cover for my wife and i prior to this .
2	one trip cover is ridiculously_expensive - especially if you travel fairly regularly .
2	a happy customer .
2	product absolutely as_described , competitively_priced and delivered very quickly .
2	i cannot see how this could be improved_upon .
2	my wife and i bought a renault koleos from this company and had nothing but grief with it for 0 0 / 0_yrs .
2	the car was either broken down on our drive or gathering_dust on their plot whilst a bunch of ignorant , arrogant , sales staff and technicians scratched their heads .
2	not only was the car sold not fit for purpose , there are several issues with this vehicle ( well engine to be more precise ) that we should have been made aware of from the start .
2	truth is , despite_being a renault dealer , i don_'_t think anyone there new a bloody thing about them .
2	in 0 0 / 0 years we lost £ 0000 with not a godamn thing to show for it , as a result of this company '_s ignorance , contempt and utter arrogance .
2	after_realising my dated redring_shower had finally packed in , i browsed the internet to see if i could still find a replacement .
2	i found a virtually_identical ( updated version ) at fastlec for a very reasonable price so ordered one .
2	the following_morning , i received an email from them informing_me that the model i had ordered was now in fact obsolete but was offered a model which should fit with little on no changes .
2	i rang them and spoke to a very nice_chap_who assured me that there would be no_problems with the alternative so , i agreed to have that model ( which incidentally i was offered at the same price ).
2	the unit arrived at my place of work the following_day , when i got it home i discovered the only change needed was a 00mm 00 degree bend and hey_presto , in and running in 00_mins .
2	thanks to everyone concerned at fastlec for a fantastic service .
2	there '_s not many companies these days who would even let you know there was problem let_alone contact you and advise you of a solution .
2	rating would have been 0 / 0 if i could .
2	the price was the lowest available , the order was processed efficiently , the printer arrived next_day .
2	what more could i want ?
2	oh_yes , the sales_team were friendly too .
2	highly_recommended , i will buy from printerland again .
2	when we placed an order the web_site failed to finalise the payment procedure so we tried a number of times again without_success .
2	we then found out that four paments had been taken from the bank_account .
2	we received an email_confirming that the duplicated payment would be refunded but we have now strated to receive the duplicated items by post .
2	we have not been able to contact the company so my recommendation would be to shop elsewhere .
2	laura jones
2	excellent !
2	there was a shipping mistake so it was shipped slow instead of 0 day i paid for .
2	i contacted memory suppliers and was immediately credited for cost of shipping .
2	excellent service .
2	everyone makes_mistakes sometimes .
2	they more than made up for it .
2	would highly_recommend memory suppliers .
2	very satisfied , from requesting a price on the website to recieving a cheque the whole_process took just five days , simple
2	i was delighted with my purchase of a radio cd_player and it was delivered very quickly and if i require any other hifi stuff i would shop_here
2	ordered two guitars and amps friday , arrived monday_morning .
2	excellent service , backed_up by great courier in tnt .
2	ordered products on tuesday_evening and all delivered on thursday_morning , and extremely well - packaged to boot .
2	very easy web - site to negotiate and find what you wanted , easy to order what you wanted , order acknowledged almost_immediately , order despatched same day and goods received the following_day on standard first_class postage .
2	i doubt anyone could offer a better service .
2	why fork_out for very expensive named_brand toners , or other marginally_cheaper toners , when you can save_money with as technology ?
2	their toners are as good as anything i have used in my xerox_0000 mfp and no matter what i am printing the print quality is always excellent .
2	you can buy a complete set , three colours plus the black , from as technology for the price of a standard black_toner_cartridge from xerox .
2	why pay more ?
2	professional service , emails all the way , good advice , good delivery , excellent product ( so_far !
2	only been in 00_minutes ) easy to deal with and talk to , who needs more ?
2	couldn_'_t have wished go a better service .
2	i will_definitely use petfleas from now on .
2	keep_up the good work
2	the waistcoat arrived quickly , and the quality was excellent .
2	i would recommend your company to my friends
2	i bought two_pairs from glasses_direct , i have one pair with normal lenses with a blue_tint , and another pair with the dark_green sunglasses lens fitted .
2	i had to return the sunglassses pair after 0 months due to the outer surface coming off away from the lens , and glasses_direct brilliantly honoured their guarantee for these glasses and they were duly returned for repair .
2	oh_dear !!
2	the glasses returned to me had the blue_tint not the dark_green sunglasses lens i had returned , so i am now six_weeks without these sunglasses , thank_god the english weather is so crap , rain rain rain .
2	so basically you pays your money , you takes your chance .
2	i ordered a tv from pixmania through their website , and paid via_paypal .
2	they realised that their website was wrong and sent me a lower model tv than i had ordered but did not charge me any less .
2	i obviously refused to accept delivery and requested a full_refund .
2	i informed paypal that the order had been cancelled and that i was due a full_refund .
2	pixmania refused a request from paypal for the refund , and one week_later i phoned pixmania to ask where my money was , they told me that i had to drop my paypal_dispute before they would give me my money back , in other words they are trying to blackmail me into dropping the insurance and protection of paypal - thus leaving me wide open to them denying all knowledge of any payment and me being over £_000 out of pocket .
2	pay_pal have advised me not to drop this dispute or i will lose their protection and that pixmania have to contact paypal , but pixmania are adamant not to contact paypal but maintain their stance of me dropping the dispute .
2	you have been_warned .
2	pay more , rather_than deal with these horrors
2	ordered on line at midday arrived next_day in the morning within the given time_slot .
2	all items well_packaged and as_described on line .
2	well_done .
2	looks_like gameseek . co . uk is just another scam site , after waiting for a delivery ( or at_least of information about the item being dispatched ) for more than a week , i have tried to contact them using web form on their website , then by calling them directly ... no luck phone is always busy , form doesn_'_t look working ant all :( so guys .. just be careful you can lose money as well
2	last_week i was telephoned by someone from zenith home improvements .
2	on asking the person why they hadn_'_t consulted the tps list , they accused me of being rude .
2	i asked for my name to be removed from their list .
2	about half an_hour later i received another call from this company ( a different person ); a similar conversation ensued .
2	today i received yet another cold call from them .
2	i am reporting this company to the tps .
2	they have succeeded in ensuring that i shall never do_business with them should i need the services of a home improvements company in the future .
2	really good selection of ink - jet printer_inks - i can see no difference at all between the armor and the canon originals in my printing results .
2	and paperstone was the only place i could_find a selection of ink - jet printable a0 coloured card .
2	you won_'_t believe it - flubit got the best price for everything from a fridge door to a pair of shoes .
2	ordered euros 0pm tues - arrived 0pm wed .
2	exactly_what i ordered .
2	nuff_said .
2	the service was excellent , the price competitive and the putter arrived soon after i ordered it .
2	i also managed to change the delivery date with dpd to a more convenient day for me .
2	fast , reliable service ,

2	great service , despatched the next_day , great product
2	i can highly_recommend e magnetsuk
2	the banner stands are really great value for money .
2	they were printed just as i wanted .

2	outstanding !
2	!
2	vast_array of products and services .
2	i have used ebay many_times , often to source items not generally available .
2	i usually use " buy now " feature and have always been confident of efficient delivery .
2	i have always used paypal for payments and that with ebays back up make for a secure way of making purchases on - line .
2	i have sold a few items on ebay and again found paypal very useful .
2	probably the best and most experience web seller .
2	shop with confidence and security .
2	excellent delivery and returns service .
2	huge_range of products and reviews .
2	best price on the web . nextday delivery .
2	genuine branded product .
2	having trekked around the shops and online looking for a pair of boots suitable for work ( black , stylish but without obvious styling eg .
2	conspicuous stitching ), my wife found your website .
2	knowing the type of boot i like , and she does too , we ordered on saturday 00st_december at 00am .
2	i received a text on the tuesday_morning ( 00th_december ) from the delivery company explaining the timeframe : 00 . 00 - 00 . 00 or change to alternative delivery day .
2	my boots arrived at 00 . 00am .

2	highly_recommended !

2	i called tyresonthedrive . com after viewing tyres on their website .
2	i was unsure which speed rating to use as my car had one speed rating but others were quoted on the website .
2	i phone and spoke to a company representative who advised me on the correct speed rating .
2	i made an appointment for the next_morning to have my tyres_fitted .
2	the technician , ryan , arrived at 00 . 00 the next_morning and advised me on various things to do with my tyres and vehicle in general .
2	he was a very knowledgable and friendly gentleman and explained everything he was going to do in detail .
2	my new tyres_fitted i was so pleased with the service from ryan and the company as a whole .
2	i highly_recommend tyresonthedrive . com and ryan too .
2	i was looking for a roll - out - blind luggage cover and heard about parts_gateway .
2	i entered the item i was looking for and my car details .
2	the search request was sent out to suppliers and i soon received offers to supply my item .
2	i decided on the supplier and item and bought it with no_hassle .
2	definitely use this service again .
2	product sourced was described as ' used ' and was as_described .
2	service great !!
2	highly_recommended !

2	ordered a couple of fleeces on tuesday_morning , received an email a couple of hours_later confirming_despatch and they arrived by parcelforce at 0am the next_day .
2	can '_t ask for more .
2	item was bought well in advance to be taken_away to university by my daughter .
2	sadly boohoo '_s incompetence kept the item moving around their depots but never getting to me or even contacting me .
2	despite_numerous_emails all you get is a generic computer reply saying they will get back to you ; they don_'_t .
2	they have no readily_available phone number so they seem to deter customers from actually speaking to them .
2	i managed to track down a number via internet_searches of complaint sites ..
2	when i finally spoke to a person the product arrived soon after but still many days late .
2	needless to say with such incompetence as the norm i will not use them again ..
2	still trying to call customer_services to find when i can go to the depot to get my parcel but gave up after 00_minutes of automated rubbish .
2	they can '_t even tell you how many people are in the queue in front of you .
2	the website is equally useless at trying to find where your parcel is .
2	i will not willingly use this company .
2	kindle charger ordered on sunday_night , free_postage chosen and product with me early on tuesday .
2	product displayed effectively , posted promptly and arrived in excellent condition in time for the next game .
2	spent hours looking for wooden furniture , toured all the stores but started at oak_furnitureland and ended back here as they were the best .
2	good on quality and good on price .
2	service in store was excellent , and process was easy and efficient .
2	multiple texts and mails plus drivers call direct to ensure exact delivery times are met .
2	everything delivered in good condition , we have one small_crack on the table_legs , but we just can '_t be_bothered to follow it through and its not noticeable unless you get on your hands and knees .
2	everything else was in perfect_condition .
2	if there is one improvement that could be made is the transition from store system details input to delivery driver don_'_t align .
2	we added more detailed_information due to being a new build and post_code not yet being recognised .
2	none of this data was transferred to the driver .
2	not a complaint , just an fyi .
2	the delivery happened as per planning , but it was the drivers call that made it arrive at the right house .
2	all in all , 000_% recommendation .
2	recently made a purchase and everything was of good standard until the carrier took over - city_link - and delivered my parcel to another house over 0 / 0 mile_away .
2	thankfully we had included our phone number in the purchase procedure and that was showing on the box and allowed the recipient to call us .
2	so in summary - everything_went well and swiftly until the delivery company made a complete mess of it .
2	the order arrived as promised and the meat was excellent and delicious .
2	can '_t fault any_aspect of your service including superb value .
2	one senior_member of my family was fulsome with praise and insisted that your fillet_steak was the best he has ever_eaten .
2	i wanted an a0_printer in december .
2	the choice of model involved a string of enquiries from myself and these were all handled in a knowledgeable and friendly_manner by printerland staff .
2	one of the accessories i wanted was difficult to get but they went out of their way to obtain it quickly and even rang me out of hours to keep me informed of the situation .
2	the printer , delivered promptly just a few_days before_christmas despite traffic problems caused_by the weather_conditions , turned_out to be an excellent choice .
2	when my sister wanted a new printer recently , i had no_hesitation in recommending printerland .
2	the order was placed late on wednesday_evening and was delivered on friday_morning .
2	printerland e_- mailed about the same time to check that it had arrived_safely .
2	dealing_with printerland is like dealing_with a family firm .
2	you always talk to the same people who are familiar with your order and have the answers to your questions at their finger - tips .
2	on the rare_occasions when you do get passed to another member of staff , that person has already been briefed and you don_'_t find yourself having to explain your situation over again .
2	a nice company to do_business with .
2	virgin did it all flights hotels rental_cars .
2	in flight service much_better_than british_airways .
2	the hotels were very nice and in good locations , it was obvious virgin had gone to a lot of trouble to find out about the local area for the customers using the holiday service .
2	ebay is the best tool to buy cheap small techy stuff from china or hongkong the service is fast cheap and reliable .
2	gr0 serviced very helpfull

2	using today thursday , very fast and easy service .
2	this is my 0nd computer from them , my old one is still going_strong .

2	mike ridley , ref_:_000000
2	bought a the north_face big shot rucksack for about 00_% below high_street price and it arrived in a couple of days .
2	excellent service and value .
2	right product delivered securely on time .
2	can '_t ask for more - as long as you don_'_t start ringing me to solicit support contract business !
2	( this was the reason i stopped using you several_years_ago !!)
2	had the amp for a few_days now and its perfect for my purposes .
2	it sounds great and is very versatile .
2	stephen_bower gave_me the information i needed to choose an annuity suitable for my needs .
2	he always phoned when he said he would and helped_me to fill in the necessary forms .
2	when i first began to look for an annuity_provider , i was quite worried_about how to go about it .
2	the whole_thing proved to be very straightforward when guided by the right person .
2	i was very pleased and when more funds became_available i had no_hesitation in going back to him for my second annuity .
2	i always find pet_supermarket to be very efficient and have a great range of products at very competitive_prices .
2	i would fully rcommend them to everyone i know - and i do !
2	i have purchased greetings cards a few_times and have been absolutely_delighted .

2	the service was very efficient and they kept you informed all the way .
2	will use again
2	a pleasure to use your system
2	my only comment would be about the cost of postage .
2	i buy vehicle spares from the uk and the shipments cost £ 0 for up to 00kgs via interlink_express .
2	laaaang ventetid ved telefonen min .
2	00 min .!
2	har ringet mindst én gang pr .
2	måned for at få afklaring på mystiske regninger .
2	skal også ringe for at få voicemail afmeldt .
2	flyttede 0 telefonnumre med aftale om : 0 timers taletid og 0 gb datatid - jeg_fik 000_mb datatid .
2	har sendt den oprindelige aftale ind til tdc 0 gange_og_det_er stadig ikke rettet .....
2	elendig service ....
2	jeg skifter selskab nu ...!
2	har_ikke prøvet noget tilsvarende !
2	excellent service !
2	everything_went just as it was advertised .
2	it was smooth and super quick .
2	great experience .
2	good easy to use webshop and good back - end service .
2	transaction went_smoothly and to plan .
2	i have used mazuma about 0 times now over the years and found the experience superb .
2	there are more players out there now so i decided to compare this time , there all pretty_much the same and i did find one that would supposedly give me £ 0 more for my phone .
2	but when you post your phone wednesday_lunchtime and receive an email before_lunch the following_day to say the money has_been paid into your account .
2	so what '_s the point of looking elsewhere when i alway get paid what they say on the site and the experience is this good with no wait for my money .
2	well_done forget 0 starts 00 / 00
2	ordered a fridge drawer (£_00 . 00 ) on a thursday_lunchtime to replace a broken item and paid for next_day delivery (£ 0 . 00 ) as i was on leave the following_day to receive the delivery , but was back at work the following week and would not be at home for delivery .
2	the booking was followed up with a dispatch confirmation stating that the item has_been dispatched from the distribution_centre at_0000hrs on friday_morning .
2	the item didnt arrive until the following_monday at_0000hrs a full 0 days after ordering - hardly next_day is it partmaster ?
2	0 complaint emails later requesting that they refund the difference_between 0st_class and next_day delivery charge which i think is fair , but this company will not even show the courtesy to reply which says what they think about their customers .
2	it is now 0 days since i sent my first complaint email to their customer_services team and i '_m still_waiting for a reply despite a follow_up reminder to them .
2	think_twice before using partmaster , they ’ re good at taking your order and your money , but they will not respond to dissatisfied_customers .
2	i will never use them again .
2	ordered an rcf art 000 - a from mercury on good friday .
2	the item was marked as in stock , and we were desperate to receive the speaker before the following saturday to use as a matching pair for an important highly paid wedding gig .
2	despite the two bank_holidays , the speaker arrived on the wednesday .
2	had numerous_emails to inform_me of progress , and was able to track delivery with the courier .
2	highly_recommended , will_definitely use mercury again .
2	thank_you !
2	they have an unequalled range of pencils ( both wood and mechanical ) plus pen and pencil refills as well as the pens themselves !
2	the parcel always arrives very promptly .
2	excellent product ( not an import -- at_least in my case ) and excellent price .
2	and it arrived in time for christmas .
2	but i had no confirmation of my order for a week and i could not get any response by email or phone .
2	this needs to be addressed !
2	for an expensive product ( over £_000 ) the packaging ( just a plastic_bag ) was not really sufficient , but it arrived_safely .
2	excellent service , friendly , efficient and very very professional
2	the parking was easy to find the bus was comfortable and frequent .
2	a very good easy service at a great price .
2	ordered two mattresses one to be delivered in two_days , yes it happened . two delivered in 0_weeks 0 to go very good service so_far very reasonably_priced .
2	their prices are competitive so it is usually guilt free fro me to go with them for more or less commodity electronics .
2	however , from time to time i build something unusual ( such as a quiet , dual opteron based workstation ).
2	lambdatek has an office down the road so i have had a chance to talk to them on those occasions .
2	they have been friendly and helpful .
2	normally to get a premium service i expect to pay a little or a lot more , but the reverse is true in this instance .
2	i got the best rate of exchange i could_find and with no_problems attached .
2	the process was extremely efficient and simple .
2	everything was timely and my dollars arrived pronto on the day requested .
2	will use again .
2	anyone can give less for less money .
2	there is no value in tesco and no respect for customers .
2	it is a pure money_grabbing operation .
2	and i know someone_who chauffeured the directors .
2	my wife discovered an item on her till receipt that she did not buy .
2	the store manager made her wait standing at customer_services for over an_hour while he went and checked cctv which happened to show she never entered the aisle with the expensive product she had been charged for was stocked .
2	a refund with no hint of apology followed .
2	every little hurts as this monster forces smaller shops off the high_street and makes other supermarkets drag their values and quality down to compete with tesco '_s base levels .
2	i always check wickes first because they are always cheaper_than homebase and b_& q .
2	i have had a lot of building items delivered , timber , flooring , tiles .
2	usually it is all fine and that one time it arrives bashed up and the driver thinks its fine ?
2	likewise in store , a few of the staff have been helpful and polite , but my do they have more than their share of staff who really do them no favours .
2	i have heard staff aggressively effing and blinding on the shop floor without a care that customers are walking around .
2	till staff are often straight out of school vicky pollards .
2	the managers and directors really need replacing with someone_who_cares_about making the business healthy .
2	i find my nearest three stores , twickenham , hanwell , ealing , dull and dreary to walk around ( poor lighting ).
2	it '_s just not good business all_round .
2	that said , i will always check them out first because they are usually cheapest ( need to check quality sometimes though ).
2	but for price , i would not go near them .
2	item ( an sds_drill ) arrived with inadequate and torn packaging .
2	when opened there were bits and paperwork ( reg docs etc_.)
2	missing i ' d normally expect to find and the manual had been thumbed through .
2	it looked like a customer or catalogue return or ex - demo to me , plus it did not arrived sealed from the courier so who was to know .
2	charlies_direct refunded , but they didn_'_t like it and were quite snooty and unapologetic .
2	their customer rep claimed to be doing me a favour by not making a charge for returning the item to them as they did not regard it as faulty .
2	i suspect they only fully refunded to try and not get bad feedback , but john_lewis they ain '_t .
2	i will not be buying from them again .
2	very helpful over the phone before i purchased via the internet .
2	everything turned_up as_described next_day .
2	does_exactly_what they advertise - agreed a price - posted mobile to them - they paid - what else ?
2	these_people have various flashy websites suggesting they have excellent customer service however they don_'_t .
2	they don_'_t seem to be able to deliver when their website promises and they don_'_t seem to be aware of their broken_promises .
2	i ordered goods which didn_'_t turn_up despite having taken the day off ( unpaid ).
2	when i chased the order they blame the supplier ( their problem not mine ) and they seemed totally_unaware of the fact they had broken their side of the bargain and cost me a day '_s pay into the bargain .
2	i cancelled the order which happily they did refund .
2	howveer the really funny part is that they then delivered the thing a few_days_later but seemed totally_unaware of until i asked them why they had done that .
2	they then wanted me to take another day off work to wait in for their courier to collect it !
2	i have used allbatteries on several_occasions now and each transaction has_been very smooth , deliveries were quick and their prices are good .
2	i even found a battery on there for an old mp0_player which i was sure would no_longer be available .
2	so my experience with them is very good and i recommend them highly .
2	i was amazed at how good the service from toolnut was on my recent_purchase .
2	i ordered some chisels on the tuesday_evening and received the goods on the thursday .
2	excellent !
2	i will definatelly use them again and the tools are excellent too , came fully honed and ready to use .
2	goods arrived promptly and as expected .
2	i recieved my order promptly and was kept_informed of the state of my order by email until its arrival .
2	the most friendly and helpfull manager in matt wooton .
2	great price and service .
2	i bought this model as it is british made and respected in the catering industry .
2	it was offered at the best price i could_find and the courier delivery was fast .
2	the gps tracking was amazing , never seen this facility before .
2	on the day of the delivery i was notified by email with a link to a map_showing my delivery one hour_slot plus a map indicating where the driver was .
2	just brilliant .
2	this company is the best i have ever used .
2	their prices are top_notch and their contact is first_class .
2	i would never hesitate buying from them again or recommending them to anyone .
2	they really treat you like a customer from the moment of purchase to after sales .
2	well_done .
2	if i could give them ten stars , then i would .
2	this is my second order with this company and again it was the price that caught my eye .
2	coupled_with quick dispatch , who can ask for more .
2	they have an efficient knowledgable helpful uk office and they answer the telephone promptly
2	very efficient easy to use service that gives clear breakdown of cost of different suppliers .
2	and when you have a problem there is someone at the end of a uk telephone who answers the telephone promptly to quickly & efficiently resolve it .
2	this is 0nd company i called to two plumbing faults .
2	the 0st company was unable to even attempt to resolve the problems .
2	simon clegg of pimlico_plumbers attended at the appointed time .
2	diagnosed the faults , advised on different options to resolve & then completed quick professional tidy job .
2	expensive but you get what you pay for .
2	excellent website , very straightforward and easy to use .
2	far less hassle than than queing up in the po or bank .
2	also having_searched extensively online the exchange_rate offered here was the best available .
2	will_certainly be back for more .
2	check out highland_titles , by buying a deed you are also helping in the conservation of the land .
2	i have posted two reviews on this company .
2	i would advise you not to trust them .
2	i purchased an expensive toaster , which had a large mark on the stainless_steel .
2	they accepted it was defective by e_- mail after i sent photographs and said they would replace .
2	they then told me when i chased up that they had not stock ( despite the website showing the item as available ).
2	when they could not tell me when they would get stock i asked for a refund .
2	miraculously then stock became_available .
2	they said they could send it that day , then that it had missed the van .
2	when i chased again they said that they had received one toaster and it had been sent to someone_else .
2	this is incredible - it seems that they may have lied about stock to prevent a refund .
2	they also attempted to renege on the agreement to accept the product was defective .
2	they are now collecting the defective toaster and have agreed to refund , but they are plainly untrustworthy and i would urge that you do not buy from them .
2	i am considering reporting them to trading_standards , principally because of the apparent lie .
2	ordered the tickets to see olivia newton john in november , we got the tickets 0_weeks before the concert , it was a once in a lifetime event , i thought the prices were a bit_steep , but well_worth it , she was fantastic .
2	a full range of skilled tradesmen under one roof : very pleased with their work .
2	i play on lots of bingo sites but smooch is most definitely in my top 0 , heres why , with most of these sites now only giving a measly £ 0 bonus on a 00 pound deposit , smooch breaks the mould by offering huge 000_% plus offers every week , i like the colour of the site , its bright and vibrant , username lotsofwins0me
2	ordered the new the walking dead game for my xbox000 , game crawler came up with ' the game collection ' as the cheapest price for the game so i went_ahead and ordered .
2	website was easy to navigate with email_updates about the progress and dispatch of the order , all in all would happily use them again and no_qualms recommending them .
2	always excellent , speedy service .
2	an excellent website with all the information required to book your holiday from_start to finish with everything covered from flights to transfers to accomadation and competitive_prices with no cc charges
2	just returned from a 0week holiday in tenerife flying with jet0 a very capable airline that provides all your needs and more
2	i recently sold 0 phones to mazuma , no_fuss , no_hassle , just a quick honest service , money within 0 days .
2	excellent .
2	will use again .
2	i was quite amazed that a heavy object in newcastle could be delivered the next_day as promised at the point of sale , ( online order ) to worcester and that i was kept_informed of estimated delivery time on the day and given options to amend the delivery instructions while it was in transit .
2	the parcel was delivered within the estimated range .
2	this is precious as the recipient was able to manage their schedule for the day without wasting time .
2	and time is money .
2	paypal made a duplicate order and simply_scuba immediately refunded .
2	goods arrived less_than 00_hours_later .
2	good to do_business with .
2	matt turned_up on time and was friendly and professional .
2	this is the third time we have used them and wouldn_'_t hesitate to go back .
2	this is the most unacceptable company i have come_accross .
2	they never phone when they say they will , scare you about unretrievable data , take your money when infact very little has_been done and never return the hardware sent .
2	trading_standards must get involved .
2	last_week i bought tickets to bruno mars concert for me and my family .
2	we will travel to dubai tomorrow to attend the concert on april 00 .
2	i thought i would have the tickets after i click the purchase button .
2	but i never got the tickets .
2	on the viagogo website it only said that my ticket purchases were " pending confirmation ".
2	according to their terms and conditions , i should know for sure within 00_hours if i have tickets or not .
2	well , it has_been 0 days so_far and still it is pending confirmation .
2	i sent them several emails but all replies were vague and unhelpful .
2	i tried_calling but nobody ever answers .
2	i called my bank who informed me there is some unsafe activity on the credit_card so it had to be cancelled .
2	i sent an email to viagogo to inform them of this , that it has_been more than 00_hours and no confirmed ticket , so consider the order cancelled .
2	they replied by telling_me that i cannot cancel !!
2	in other words i do not have any rights !!
2	how is this possible ?
2	i was not provided with the tickets within 00_hrs , and there was no payment transaction , so how can i not cancel ?
2	i have never come_across this type of abuse of customer rights .
2	i do not want the tickets !
2	this has_been traumatic experience !
2	when i first queried my bill , i got a letter from them some time later which stated that they could not accept my initial meter_reading ( though i had never queried it , i had told them that their end of bill reading was wildly too high ).
2	i phoned to complain , but found that i was ` no .
2	00 in a queue '.
2	i then sent a written letter of complaint by post , but received no reply whatsoever .
2	a couple of weeks_later re - sent the letter as an attachment to the complaints form on their web - site , but still received no reply .
2	now given up expecting any reply and have switched to another supplier - life '_s too short !
2	quality aluminium framed raleigh bike delivered exactly as promised at a good price .
2	much_better value than " high_street_stores " so called discounted offers .
2	a great price superb service , andy the fitter excellent efficient job , highly_recommend
2	i received an e_- mail this morning to say my item would be delivered between 00 . 00_hours and 00 . 00_hours .
2	its the first time a delivery was so specific usually you have to waste a whole day waiting for delivery . my delivery arrives at approx 00 . 00 absolutely_brilliant .
2	thank_you pmc .
2	i regularly shop on the internet and i have found this company first_class with its communication .
2	they reply promptly and courteously to all orders and any_queries which i find very satisfying .
2	their products are described accurately and you are kept_fully_informed if items ordered are out of stock and awaiting delivery .
2	i would highly_recommend dealing_with this company .
2	i have used this company for my battery purchases for a very long time , their service is first_class and prices are always very competitive .
2	i would highly_recommend them to anyone looking for bulk buy , high_quality batteries .
2	i found hills to supply the samsung sound_bar to be the best price and i was informed very quickly after_submitting the order that they were out of stock .
2	however , they cave me an immediate date for dispatch and delivery within 00_hours .
2	it was delivered as promised .
2	the shopping_experience with halls is the best i have had with large purchases over the internet .
2	i would highly_recommend this company .
2	i having been looking for a quality bath robe for several months now , especially one without a heavy collar .
2	this one fitted the bill and is extremely comfortable .
2	i would highly_recommend to anyone .
2	quick efficient service at excellent value for money .
2	i would recommend to anyone .
2	the service i received was first_class .
2	the goods arrived very quickly in the time_slot_allocated .
2	i would certainly shop_here again .
2	i was very concerned that these knobs would look and feel cheap as they were significantly_lower in price than some alternative knobs .
2	but i need not have worried , the knobs look and feel great .
2	real porcelain and very heavy !
2	also very nice fixing design - no need to butcher the door trying to find the tapped pillar on the opposing knob .
2	this has_been the third velux_roof window i have bought from roofing_superstore and am , once again , very happy with the service .
2	the product was delivered on the day specified when it was ordered , by a courier that took pride in his job .
2	exactly the same experience i had when i bought my first two velux_roof_windows .
2	what is more , roofing_superstore was extremely competitive with pricing too !
2	barry and his_team offer an excellent service .
2	they are very knowledgeable of the travel industry , in our case , flights to australia .
2	we were made aware of the tricks that some travel companies can play to increase what initially appear to be bargain_basement prices .
2	to the credit of worldbound_travel ltd , we obtained an excellent price for our one - way ticket to sydney , with absolutely no_hidden_extras or surprise increases !
2	finally , no matter at what time we telephoned , barry was always available – makes me think he lives and sleeps at work !
2	!
2	do not trust this company , 0 months waiting for a part , 0 email 0_weeks_ago to say part was " in transit " where from the far side of the bloody galaxy ?
2	phone now cut_off , will not respond to emails or faxs i say again !!!!!
2	do not trust your hard_earned_money to these robbing bastards are you reading this des coffey ??????
2	?
2	easy to navigate web_pages , market_leading prices would recommend to anybody
2	i would have no_hesitation in recommending printerland to friends and colleagues .
2	great service , competitive_pricing and good products .
2	keep it up .

2	spot on service would use again without a doubt , many_thanks
2	mr p crascall
2	the website itself was no better or worse than competition .
2	the differential was the team that got onto the job so quickly and came up with options that fitted our groups needs which is not easy for 0 families .
2	i would like to say a huge thank to the " buff naked butlers company .
2	they were so easy to deal with , they answered my email promptly along with all my questions and totally put me at ease , the whole_process from_start to finish was very easy , hassle_free and extremely professional .
2	i would definitely recommend them .
2	our butler was called adam and he was brilliant , he completely joined in with our party games and made sure everybody '_s drink was topped_up ( there were 00 of us !)
2	not only was he very handsome with a gorgeous body but he was so lovely too and mingled with everybody .
2	he was certainly the highlight of the evening as the hens are still talking_about it now !
2	get booking girls the butlers are well_worth it !
2	!
2	patricia
2	recently received a siam - mods cube from safercigs and it is a very nice bit of kit .
2	great service and would deal with again without_hesitation .
2	i was really under_pressure from the wife as the washing_machine had broken down and the british_gas home care service people were next to useless .
2	when we requested an_urgent visit .
2	we were told it would be within a few_days , then they rung back to say it would be delayed further as their engineer had gone sick .
2	so , i had to act quickly to avoid further low grade dinners and a very silent lounge !
2	i had used appliances_online before ( as they were called then ), and had found their service to be very good so i logged on , did a bit of research , placed the order and waited for the email to come through .
2	bingo !
2	there it was and then the text_message .
2	next_day had a lady call me to make_sure all was well , had a text from the driver on the day of delivery - a sunday would you believe !
2	- he called to say he would be there within the hour .
2	he turned_up , dropped_off the new washing_machine , i plumbed it in within 00_minutes and hey_ho the wife was back in the utility_room with the pile of washing quickly diminishing .
2	so all in all a fantastic service with great prices .
2	must go my lovely roast dinner is on the table .... oh and the lounge isn_'_t so quiet either , not sure that bit is a bonus though !
2	:-)
2	easier than i imagined and about half the price i expected !
2	great to deal with from browsing items , to actually ordering .
2	they keep in touch with you all the way , letting you know when the goods have been dispatched , and an_approximate delivery date .
2	always a good selection of gear , and in stock .
2	great service as i ordered item late saturday_afternoon , and it arrived monday_morning !!
2	well_packaged and informed of status throughout transaction .
2	will_definately purchase from this company again .
2	first time i have used big dog_world , now i regret not using them before now .
2	excellent company , easy website to use , very competitive_prices , very fast delivery , excellent communications .
2	i will use big dog_world again , thank - you .
2	they billed me over £ 0000 . 00 for data i didn_'_t use !.
2	in my experience they couldn_'_t care less about their customers … they seem to be driven by greed .
2	i wish they really did " record their calls " that way they couldn_'_t blatantly deny all responsibility for saying things they later deny .
2	it '_s the orange customers who are the only real_asset and not the orange brand ironically run by " number crunchers " that have destroyed their own_brand by squeezing every drop of trust from its previously loyal_customers which is why ee can '_t wait to drop the name .
2	i for one will be glad to see them finally run out of juice !
2	i also hope that ee " everything everywhere " doesn_'_t apply to employing the bandits responsible for oranges demise .
2	rotten to the core !
2	have bought quite a few items from them .
2	have never quibbled about returns .
2	only one complaint about missing goods where an unhelpful operative wanted me to wait 00 days before any action taken ( items were ordered for next_day delivery ) the query sent to find if i was satisfied brought a quick response from further up the line , an_apology and the item delivered next_day .
2	it had gone to another part of the country and wasn_'_t coming_back any time soon without some help .
2	i spent some time trying to find a hinge for our dryer door , ( i didn_'_t break it , honest ) anyway sparesgroup uk came up with the right part for our model , at a good price .
2	i ordered the part on a sunday , by thursday , part received and job_done , and the boss said " that '_s much_better now "
2	so , excellent service all_round and will use again in my hour of need
2	that is truly worthwhile especially when somebody says you can have upto 00 what
2	the only issue i had was with delivery .
2	i thought it took an additional day compared to standard first_class letter mail and the package had been sent first_class tracked with royal_mail .
2	will give cyclestore the benefit of the doubt on this !
2	so simply , great price - easy to order online !
2	!
2	i have dealt_with merlin for many_years_now - you can trust them to have the right bits at the right prices .
2	however , their best bargains are not easy to find , so you can quite easily stumble - upon an excellent piece of kit at a really incredible price !
2	come on merlin - let everyone share in your bargains - you guys are doing many things right , and have done for years !
2	not unless you want those bargians to be a real secret !!
2	!
2	with winter coming up i decided to have a radiator added in my front room , a friend of mine recommend vhl heating and i '_m very glad she did , the service provided was amazing , can '_t fault them , would recommended to everyone
2	i would recomend key_retirement solutions without_hesitation .
2	elaine_fletcher explained it so that i understood everything and gave excellent guidance through the entire_process .
2	both the products and consumables are excellent value .
2	you can order over the internet and they will arrive next_day .
2	what more could you ask for !
2	pat smyth
2	ordered 0000 friday and delivered by 0000 saturday .
2	easy to narrow_down my machine and from there pick the part that i wanted .
2	easy orderering and payment and quick delivery .
2	a good overall experience .
2	ordered one day , at a great price , and delivered the next .
2	can '_t ask for better_than that .
2	i ordered a summer bundle of pumps , shorts and 0 t shirts .
2	they sent the wrong_colour and size of pumps .
2	i contacted them ( not able to do this by phone ) through the site and returned the pumps for exchange .
2	i had to chase them up after they had had them back for 0 days and was then told - out of stock and would get refund .
2	now trying to get through to them that this was ordered as a bundle and i want to return the lot as it is not what i ordered at all , not just a refund for the part of the bundle .
2	they do not answer what i sent them but what they think i should have asked .
2	this has_been going on for 0_weeks .
2	send a message and wait a day before any reply back .
2	order number_00000000 .
2	i ordered 0 bags of skinners dog_food one morning and at 0000 the next_morning they were delivered .
2	excellent price and free delivery !
2	my wife persuaded me to book this trip for my 00th_birthday and i think secretly wanted me to lose some weight and get fit and used this trip as a bribe .
2	well i am so glad she did .
2	when i joined a private_expeditions training walk i realised that i really was nowhere as fit as i thought i was and this really gave_me a kick up the backside .
2	well 0 months later i had lost nearly 00kg which was a huge_success before i even set foot on the mountain .
2	the climb itself was incredible .
2	abigail and i had never slept in a tent and were amazed that the tents were comfortable and the food was really good .
2	it is quite amazing what the team produced .
2	our guide gaston and the assistant guide elias were brilliant all the way through the trek and on summit night we really appreciated their support .
2	at times i really wanted to stop but they kept me going and the feeling when we reached the top was out of this world .
2	big hugs and a few tears !
2	!
2	words can '_t say how much i enjoyed the whole_thing .
2	i am now a convinced trekker .
2	roll on the next trip .
2	i '_ve now used black_circles several_times to buy my tyres .
2	black_circles gives you the choice of the exact tyre you want , at a saving in my case of more than 00_% over local tyre_fitting companies .
2	if you know what you want it couldn_'_t be simpler , and if you are not sure , the web_site helps you choose .
2	there '_s a choice of convenient fitting agents , listed with the mileage from where you are .
2	in my case , i simply chose a local_garage i already trusted and was convenient in location .
2	fitting time can be chosen at the ordering time , or even negotiated locally once the order is placed .
2	the only time i would reluctantly not use black_circles is if i had to have the tyre the same day , or next_day .
2	i was surprised to get an email giving me a forecast delivery time , with a four hour_window .
2	then the next thing was at 0 minutes past the earliest target time , a knock at the door and there it was !
2	only_critisism , the delivery agent was in a plain black shirt and i never noticed the logo .
2	since i didn_'_t look out in the street , i didn_'_t see the van , and there was nothing on the box delivered to say who the carrier was .
2	really they should try to show the branding more , so we know who is so very good !
2	i have been seeking viable led solutions for existing luminaires ( lamp fittings that is !)
2	especially " warm_white " and b00 old_fashioned bayonet cap types .
2	the kosnic lamps , although chinese ( isn_'_t everything now ?)
2	are aimed squarely at the british market , so i chose to give them a try .
2	they are excellent , but too white for my wife to tolerate .
2	meanwhile , the suppler lampshop_online gave prompt , well_packaged , service with courier transport at a fair price .
2	what more can you ask for ?
2	i ordered a blazer and some more stuff , all of excellent quality .
2	it arrived the next_day and as i wanted to exchange an item that too was done without_any hassle .
2	highly_recommended
2	goods were good quality at a reasonable price .
2	fast delivery and well_packed .
2	found this site online .
2	their prices beat the competition .
2	easy to order and easy to get a dealer nearby to supply & fit the tyres .
2	after 0_weeks , we are still_waiting for one part of bed to arrive ( unusable without it ).
2	this part was initially lost by the mattressman courier and then delivered one week_later ( earliest they could offer ) and was smashed to bits with footprints all over the outer_box .
2	now awaiting delivery in yet anothert week of new replacement part to be able to build the bed .
2	also found that in trying to sort_out the problem , mattressman customer service is always busy and all calls are diverted to a third_party call_centre to take a message and then it takes several hours to receive a return phone_call from cs .
2	happily used mattressman many_times before but sadly never again
2	i ordered a bouquet from iflorist on thursday 00th_september_0000 for delivery next_day ( and paid for this ) the next_day no delivery turned_up despite taking my money .
2	i have tried to make contact on several_occasions as they have no phone contact i tried via_email and fax to no_avail .
2	i have also sent my details with order reference to the address supplied on the web_site to see if i can make any contact .
2	and am waiting to hear from them .
2	i sent today registered_post a letter to ask that they make contact with me to resolve the situation and will wait to see if i have any reply .
2	i ordered a new freezer to compliment the beko_fridge that i bought from ao . com a few weeks earlier , before choosing the freezer i had an opportunity to video reviews on ao '_s website which helped_me greatly in selecting the correct beko_freezer , having made my choice , i went through the payment process and was even allowed to select the day i wanted delivery and at the same time i was given information on days that a delivery van was already in my area , this information allowed_me to contribute to a fuel savings policy or not as i chose .
2	from the moment of purchase to the delivery day i was kept_informed of the delivery progress , and even on delivery day at 0000 i was informed by telephone of an_approximate delivery slot by one of the friendly delivery drivers it also gave_me an opportunity to advise the driver of any delivery problems he might encounter such as poor parking , all in all i was very pleasantly_surprised by my shopping_experience with ao . com and wouldn_'_t hesitate to recommend them to anyone considering buying electrical goods for the home , in fact my next and any future_purchases will_definitely be with ao . com thank_you for such a pleasant and great shopping_experience ...
2	i loved this site .
2	all advices and suggestions for those ( me ) who
2	were about to buy their first piano are precious .
2	thank !
2	thinking my voucher had expired as i was unable to redeem so one quick click to chat & the lovely nikki had me sorted in no time at all .
2	even answered another question which i hadnt even asked yet re my password .
2	fab service .
2	me v happy !
2	i '_ve never had a single problem ordering with simplygames . com
2	always get a better deal on games prices compared to other_companies on the web .
2	games arrive on time & even before time :)
2	can '_t rate this company enough , i '_ll be getting all of my ps0 & xbox one games from here in the future ....
2	was quoted £_000 to fix my samsung 00 " lcd_tv .
2	ordered the main board from flattvparts on one afternoon and it arrived at 0 . 00am the following_morning .
2	00_minutes fitting it and the tv was back to fully working .
2	fantastic service , part was easy to find on the site , was exactly as_described and saved me over £_000 in repairs !
2	i would definitely recommend them .
2	purchased a nikon 00 - 000mm vr0 and to be honest was very sceptical_about how good the price was but took the gamble .
2	ordered effortlessly within minutes from the uk late friday_evening , it was delivered monday noon by dhl .
2	didn_'_t realise it was coming from_hong_kong but seriously after receiving this fantastic service and most of all the awesome price including delivery , i will be checking digitalrev first for any new gear i need from now on .
2	regarding the the actual lens , it is a fantastic lens , and so_far well_worth the money , i reviewed this lens for a while and i '_m really glad i purchased it .
2	i run a d0000 , 00 - 00mm vr , 00 - 000mm vr , 00mm 0 . 0d and now this 00 - 000mm vr0 .
2	if your thinking of buying this or any other lens from digitalrev then go for it .
2	well_done digitalrev 00 / 00
2	item exactly as_described and what i wanted , postage was very prompt
2	can '_t fault them .
2	at a time when most large companies treat their customers as if they were dirt on their shoe with any resemblance between delivery estimates and actual delivery being purely co - incidental , it is indeed a breath of fresh_air to find a company like ao . com who seem to value their customers .
2	delivery was as requested , within a specified 0 hour tine slot , confirmed both before the day and by driver when they had set out for the day '_s deliveries .
2	even if they weren_'_t cheaper_than the high_street retailers ( who actually never carry any stock anyway !!!
2	so internet ordering and delivery is required ) i would seriously_consider_using ao . com for my purchases .
2	they will_certainly be my first_port of call for future_purchases .
2	i was really impressed with the product - two brass engraved door signs .
2	extremely well produced and delivered within a couple of days so i had them up for our official opening when i thought it a lost cause !
2	i wanted new specialised batteries for my cordless telephone .
2	buyabattery delivered exactly_what i wanted on time at a reasonable price .
2	i received my order in double quick time with no_problems .
2	the price was very good and i will_definately be using brandfill again
2	have ordered a number of things and would recommend this site .
2	we booked mcfly tickets for their sunday 00nd_september concert on wednesday 00th_september after office hours .
2	the online booking process is clear and quick and confirms what seats you will receive .
2	the cost of the tickets was below the face value and so excellent value .
2	we received a phone_call from one of your customer service staff on thursday 00th who confirmed that the tickets would be delivered on friday 00th between_0am and 0pm and they need signing for .
2	tickets were received as above in good order .
2	we have used this service before and again it was an excellent service .
2	user_friendly system to sell your mobile .
2	received bag to post next_day .
2	bank payment was made next_day on receipt of phone and was in my bank_account within the hour .
2	this is an excellent service and highly_recommended .
2	item arrived very quickly and in perfect working order .
2	super_fast delivery especially as it was the week before_christmas .
2	we will never go back to normal wellies in winter - my feet have never been so warm .
2	can '_t rate the service of this company highly_enough .
2	the sunglasses arrived as promised on time and at all times i was kept_informed of the progress of the order .
2	excellent customer service , will_definitely recommend to friends and family .
2	well_done !
2	i can '_t speak highly_enough of the experience of buying from pc_specialist .
2	configuring the desktop online was easy and i particularly_liked the fact that the order was automatically checked for component compatibility , alerting_me to potential problems and suggesting an_alternative , giving the reason for doing so .
2	order tracking was excellent , the pc was very well_packed and all communication by phone was polite , friendly and helpful .
2	this is a great way to get a quality pc with branded components .
2	thanks very much to all at pcs !
2	as a seller on ebay for myself , friends & family ( a retirement ' hobby ') there are occasions when i need to ship large & bulky parcels .
2	i have previously used another on - line supplier .
2	interparcel was recommended to me by a friend i found the on - line site to be extremely easy to use , select preferred carrier & pay for the service .
2	the friendly courier from city_link turned_up on time which was promised , i have been able to easily track the parcel and it was delivered to my buyer within_00hrs .
2	as a matter of interest i took this parcel along with other items to post to local post_office & was quoted £_00 . 00 00hr service which included insurance to cover up to £_000 , interparcel was £_00 . 00 including additional_insurance_cover & vat to me that is extremely competitive and interparcel will get all my future business .
2	from ordering to receiving goods took 0 working_days and the cheapest prices around
2	price great , delivery great , but touch pad didn_'_t work on acer_laptop .
2	trying to get hold of returns manager very difficult , put on hold for 00mins after manager failed to return my first call previous day .
2	got wait to they look at laptop before i can have a replacement .
2	makes you want to got to the stores and buy a laptop knowing you can get it replaced straightaway
2	due to my disability i am mostly housebound , as such i use the internet for all my shopping needs .
2	serenata_flowers have been a revalation , although slightly expensive the service and choice is simply outstanding .
2	i have used you now for quite a while and you have never_let_me down .
2	what other ' gifts ' could you start to sell ?
2	i have a brain disease and often struggle with web sites , however this site is fresh , easy and informative .
2	will always buy from you
2	any business needs a robust structure to ultimately deliver an exceptional customer experience .
2	many business talk about putting the consumer at the heart of their thinking including sky .
2	but they don_'_t .
2	i concede that they have a good product but that '_s where it ends .
2	without paying a high price to call sky , which many people are unprepared to do , it is very hard to get in touch with sky unless you ' re happy to deal with a non uk_based centre ( which i '_m not ).
2	so i write to sky on three_separate_occasions explaining this and receive one unsatisfactory call in response , therefore ignoring two other letters asking for information .
2	as i '_m moving home ( and out of contract ) and was paying a considerable_amount per_month to sky you might have thought that for the cost of a telephone_call for my continued patronage might be worth it .
2	think again .
2	the way sky is managed is a complete disconnect with no - one allowed to either take_ownership of a problem nor use their initiative .
2	therefore i '_ve canceled my subscription .
2	ultimately over a period of 0 months ( yes 0 months ) sky have not found a way of allowing me to call them without paying for the cost of the call .
2	i have had a trail of emails with some robotic centre based i know not where you use cut and paste techniques to never fulfil my needs .
2	it really beggars_belief how inept and short - sighted sky have been in this process .
2	apart_from losing my custom there is the impact of word of mouth as if anyone asks my views apropos sky they are not tinged with any real positive glow .
2	they really have lost complete touch with the customer experience .
2	it also makes me laugh out loud every time i hear their tag line " believe in better ".
2	their kidding us , right ?
2	newsflash : do believe all you see and read about bt .
2	bt are one those organisations that manage to shoot themselves in both feet .
2	the way that they are organised is counter - intuitive to delivering a customer_focused business which is what they claim they want to achieve .
2	they are riddled with bureaucracy , take little or no ownership of customer '_s problems and toothless at resolving the most basic issues .
2	we moved home and gave bt 0_weeks to deliver on a specified day , which at no time did they challenge or suggest would pose any_issues .
2	we wanted a phone line , although as we use mobiles mainly so this was not as important as broadband .
2	we also wanted broadband which , for the many , is indispensable .
2	you must have read the script because the phone line was not a problem ( although a story to tell at another time ) but they could not provide us with broadband .
2	actually the guys said it was an easy fix but it required the two bt companies supplying us talking to each other .
2	fast forward to innumerable and unsatisfactory calls including me taking time off and waiting in all afternoon for an a no - show engineer ( he went to the cab and it was too hard from him , so i subsequently discovered ).
2	we then get the indianian call_centre horror show which is too distressing to recount .
2	after another round of hugely emotional calls we eventually get an engineer over , who has_been sub - contracted , and spends two hours achieving nothing and totally contradicts everything we '_ve been told before leaving us stranded .
2	we still don_'_t have broadband and are waiting to hear how we will be compensated .
2	the customer service experience was the double shotgun to both feet again .
2	it '_s so appalling it '_s a complete embarrassment .
2	bt are pitifully unempathetic and lacking in any desire to out the customer first .
2	they really don_'_t care and the people you speak are robots who have zero ability to get things done .
2	it '_s a complete and utter_shambles .
2	to cap it all we had been double charged for something else and noticed that we couldn_'_t see where the credit was .
2	good old bt hadn_'_t effected the credit .
2	when asked why , there was no satisfactory_explanation .
2	you might think ryan_air , virgin and sky are bad but bt make them look like the sisters theresa .
2	gumtree needs to more accountable to sellers .
2	it '_s owned by e_- bay who do offer some protection to sellers .
2	on gumtree it '_s a free for all where there are no rules and potential_buyers have a free reign .
2	the number of times i '_ve no shows from potential sellers who expressed a burning desire to want what was for sale is legion .
2	it completely wastes your time by which time you '_ve turned away some genuine buyers .
2	it doesn_'_t stop there as there seems to be an unwritten belief that no matter_how fairly you price goods the buyer thinks you should knock - off a random figure .
2	as a seller you have little , if any , recourse to complain unlike with e_- bay '_s feedback system .
2	the experience is absolutely shiv kin and makes e_- bay look like harrods by comparison .
2	i decided to try gumtree as the costs ( as a seller ) for using e_- bay have escalated to a very high_level .
2	even applying fees on postage which is absurd .
2	please_bear in mind that gumtree is owned by - you can guess - e_- bay .
2	i went into using gumtree as a seller with my eyes_open as i had heard some pretty awful stories .
2	i guess with e_- bay you get a sense that there is some semblance of the buyer and seller protection .
2	gumtree is a jungle which is not helped by their own systems which are inadequate .
2	before trying to sell something on gumtree i wanted to get a used iphone .
2	whilst there are genuine sellers i saw one locally which looked to be good to be true .
2	in an effort to smoke this guy out i asked a number of questions which a genuine seller would be prepared to answer .
2	shortly_after this i received an e_- mail from gumtree saying this guy was a suspected fraudster so don_'_t take this further .
2	they also rightly deleted the ad .
2	i was reassured by this is i thought i ' d try an sell something .
2	i know what i '_m doing but the ad didn_'_t post .
2	i ask why and am told that i had violated gumtree rules and i was barred from using gumtree and they wouldn_'_t discuss the matter .
2	end of .
2	phoning them costs an arm and a leg and they wouldn_'_t respond to e_- mails .
2	therefore i wrote to them demanding , under the rules pertaining to the data_protection act , what information they had on file as is my right .
2	after a while i get an e_- mail from gumtree admitting a mistake with a reluctant apology .
2	i have tried to sell a few things on gumtree and the experience is painful despite_being quite brutal in my listings about things .
2	the items i sell are priced to sell so i am no interested in offers .
2	i don_'_t deliver , which i put in block capitals .
2	even so i had one person ask if i '_ll make a 00 mile_round_trip for an item which cost £_00 .
2	it seems to me that the accepted rules of the gumtree jungle if you ' re a buyer is that you ignore what people put down in terms of price and frankly people don_'_t read what you write .
2	the most frustrating aspect is the number if complete time_wasters you get which is demoralising , time_consuming and massively frustrating .
2	for example .
2	" this is exactly_what i want can i pick it up tomorrow "
2	i reply yes , supply my address and we agree a time .
2	then no one shows up .
2	i e_- mail and ask if there was a problem and the answer is " yeah i changed my mind ".
2	this has happened on a few occasions and unlike e_- bay you can '_t leave_feedback .
2	even_though they are part of the same organisation i have reluctantly reverted_back to e_- bay .
2	i also discovered preloved . com who , although doesn_'_t have the audience reach of gumtree / e_- bay i have sold product through successfully without the awful gumtree experience .
2	used these_guys once before and the price , speed of delivery was top_class but the acid_test is how good the prduct is .
2	to be honest my wife and i were amazed at how long this cartridge laset without needing a replacement .
2	assumimg this purchase is as good then i would unreservedly recommned this company to anyone .
2	without_prejudice
2	the boom in cycling i guess keeps them afloat but the customer experience is beyond_belief .
2	there '_s no point in complaining as the compaints team don_'_t bother to ask your opinion and are toothless .
2	they give a sanitised ' corporate " response which is based on the customer is always wrong .
2	took my car for a new radio for my wife .
2	no expertise on site but happy to take your money .
2	went back and left with a bigger problem than when i started .
2	a big hole where a once working radio was with the bracket bent beyond_repair ( i was told that removal of bracket would take two minutes not an_hour ).
2	no - one on site to help .
2	manager as useful as a chocolate_teapot .
2	complained and told my problem not theirs but gave refund .
2	the customer experience is everything and as businesses like comet and countless others discovered deliver this or go out of business .
2	really shoddy and unprofessional experience , never again .
2	everything_went to plan so have no comments which is the highest_praise i can give .
2	i want a hassle - free distance_selling experience which is what i got .
2	i wanted a pair of budget reading_glasses as many opticans are rip - off_merchants .
2	the entry_level deal was very good value and tbh , i expected there to be a catch .
2	they did their best to up - sell you in the process ( they would view it as providing more options ) but overall the process was simple and easy .
2	the comms was good and the speed of service excellent .
2	the product ( for the money ) is excellent .
2	the case supplied isn_'_t great but you can '_t really complain at these prices !
2	!
2	was looking for something a little different and found the repertoire website .
2	what a find it turned_out to be with all the top quality clothing at great prices .
2	after talking with the really helpful and friendly staff , my order was delivered promptly the next_day .
2	on opening my package i found exactly_what i ordered , even better ' in the flesh ', beautifully_packaged and wrapped with tissue_paper .
2	will_definately be ordering again and would recommend to everyone .
2	thank_you very much
2	ordering anti - malarial_tablets from travelpharm was straight_forward and tablets arrived very fast
2	this was the best deal you could_possibly get for a boccia titanium watch .
2	considerably_cheaper_than the high_street and even internet based sellers .
2	delivery was excellent and much_quicker_than i expected .
2	all - in - all an excellent on - line shopping_experience from_start to finish .
2	i highly_recommend the watch_hut .
2	every time you shop at simplysupplements there are always great deals on essential dietary_supplements & vitamins .
2	always 0 for the price of one , which make the deals even better .
2	compare with others & you '_ll see what a great deal you are getting .
2	telephone support great and helpful .
2	ordering online simple and quick .
2	price competitive .
2	part delivered next_day as promised .
2	will use again .
2	i had a problem with a product , phoned up and the phone was answered without a wait which makes a change these days .
2	a prepaid_bag arrived the next_day along with a replacement .
2	good quick service , no haggling just pece of mind .
2	goods at a good price , tracked postage , well_packaged and exactly as advertised .
2	thankyou .
2	easy to use could have used a bit more resin , but otherwise everything is in the box and easy to use if you have good diy_skills
2	good products , great prices and quick delivery .
2	spot on !!!!
2	!
2	i bought verticle blinds , they arrived with all bits in four days .
2	as a reasonable diyer they were fairly easy to put up , but the instructions are not what they should be .
2	a little more information would be of help to the reluctant diyer and could improve sales if people felt_confident to put these up them selves .
2	check out the videos for epdm roofing products ( i am not selling and there are lots of firms if you google ), a similar thing could help here .
2	i will buy again and will recomend .
2	good prices , good garage , good tyres , second time i '_ve_used them .
2	so here ’_s the deal .
2	i order my new iphone from apple . com and my new sim from vodafone .
2	both of them international brands that claim to have customer service as their top priority .
2	one of them uses_dpd to deliver and one uses ups .
2	both are delivering the same day .
2	the day before delivery i get an email from apple telling_me their carrier will be in touch and a tracking_number .
2	the same from vodafone .
2	ups mail me and say “ we ’ ll be with you between_0am and 0pm ” effectively “ stay in all day if you want us to deliver , we ’ re badly organised and you ’ re the guy_who has to suffer for it ” dpd text me and say “ your parcel will be delivered by lee and it will be with you between 0 . 00 and 00 . 00 ” dpd ’_s message is “ we know your busy and as you ’ re the customer , we ’ ll work with you to disrupt your day as little as possible ”.
2	00 . 00 on the dot , lee arrives .
2	smiles and hands me my package .
2	dpd not only make themselves look great but also make me think that vodafone are really looking after me .
2	well_done dpd and vodafone for a great partnership that put me , the customer , at the centre .
2	as for ups , they sent me a note at 00 . 00 saying the address was wrong so could they come another day .
2	i cancelled my order with apple .
2	so now my view of ups is poor and now my view of apple is poor .
2	if you want a courier to deliver on your promises , use dpd .
2	it will make me think you care about me because dpd definitely care about me .
2	every time i use easygate i get high speed quality service .
2	the advice is excellent and accurate and doesn_'_t make you feel you ' re being " sold at ".
2	the products are delivered promptly and are well_packaged .
2	very easy to use , quick delivery , good price .
2	recommended .
2	ordered a fox royale bedchair .
2	great service , very quick delivery , and best price on the web !
2	superb !
2	highly_recommend , and would use again .
2	cheers .
2	great service , ordered my wife a joules jacket at 0pm on a friday , it arrived next_morning at 0am .
2	same when i ordered my hunter wellingtons , superb .
2	pity all companies dont operate like this !
2	highly_recommended .
2	my north_face nuptse jacket was delivered very quickly at a great price .
2	highly_recommended
2	i ordered a knight outdoor_table_tennis_table which was the cheapest outdoor full size table i could_find that looked of a decent quality .
2	on receiving the order there was some damage , and the company were extremely_helpful in dealing_with the issue and resolved the matter completely , in this case by a credit even_though they had offered to replace the whole table .
2	great and prompt customer service , thankyou wendy .
2	i dont normally_write any reviews but i will_certainly be back when its time to upgrade my kit as the children grow older .
2	i trust norton_000 but the pricing for renewals is always tricky , enter total_computing who were offerring a cd based version for 0 pc '_s for the same price as other_peoples downloads and free_postage .
2	it would have been rude not to !
2	arrived recorded post a few_days_later and has worked_flawlessly - well_done guys !
2	ordered product 0pm tuesday , delivered 0pm wednesday !
2	kept well informed of delivery progress including a text_advising 0 hour_slot followed_by a call from the delivery team .
2	only_downside is the " hardsell " telephone_call for product insurance that follows .
2	( probably how aol make their profit and can offer the lower product prices and free delivery !!
2	).
2	goods ordered am wednesday , delivered am thursday , kept_informed of order progress right through from placing to receipt - all this and very competitive_prices , these are the sort of companies we should be supporting .
2	will no doubt be using them again and have no_hesitation in recommending them .
2	delivered to suit my requirements , excellent product .
2	although there was a missing component in my delivery this was delivered by courier without_delay or hassle .
2	would recommend this company and product .
2	had to use the recovery on paypal more than once against those who try to fraud buyers , it has always made it worthwhile using paypal .
2	a quick google_search for a specific pr of north_face shoes and all - weather . co . k was one of those returned , decided to place an order and it was very fast and easy to do via the web_interface , communications were great and shipping update plus tracking , if it wasn_'_t for the weekend my order would have been received the very next_day .
2	superb service
2	steve
2	hello all ,
2	i used travel_republic to find accommodation in aberdeen area ,, also tried some other_sites but found that travelrepublic site gave better value and better offers even used it to find a car there and got a great deal car for 0 week 00_euros couldn_'_t be_beaten else where , everything_went very smoothly once booked
2	so would recommend to anyone
2	hi bought a blaupunkt tv from pixmania site ,, delivered on time , well_packed ,, adopter wasn_'_t supplied as stated with purchase but when i e_- mailed customer_services it was delivered few_days_later sent 0 for inconvenience ,, all in all very happy with tv and with service ,, will use them again ,, i had read some bad_reviews about them ,, but in my experience i have trust in their site and their service ,, keep_up great products and price ,, thanks jim
2	ordered a one piece oversuit for my motorbike gear and was amazed at the info given and the service and delivery were second to none , thanks will be dealing_with you again .
2	i have used vistaprint quite a few_times now , mainly for business_cards and cannot_fault how easy from_start to finish it is to get started designing them or just using stock cards , would truely reccomend vistaprint to one and all .
2	mpb were reccomended to me by someone_else who has dealt_with them , i cannot_fault their professionalism in dealing_with various queries , on that basis alone i went back to them , i have had various slr '_s and lenses and have been extremely pleased with what has arrived and the excellent condition of the items , the dispatch time is amazing and when sending items in to part exchange all the worry is taken out of it as they have it collected , would highly_reccomend to anyone and will no doubt be looking at my next lens from these_guys , thanks mpb for making the process painless , cheers .
2	looked at many usual suppliers from specialist tool shops online , diy suppliers and found even with trade discount that buyaparcel was the best price .
2	ordered several stanley tool box organisers , all were in stock and all arrived within 0 days of ordering from godfreys it .
2	so now include buyaparcel in all my future searching
2	easy to use site , but does not react well to using auto fill name / address etc .
2	as this seemed to freeze the process and i had to close site and restart , but my shopping_cart was still ok .
2	quick next_day delivery .
2	all items individually very well_packaged , took some time to remove but thats better_than having split liquid containers .
2	overall impressed and will use again .
2	unfortunately for some reason that escapes me , i did not as usual look for reviews on wae_+ otherwise i would not be writing this .
2	i too like so many others have placed an order ( for a tv ) that was and still is shown as ' 0 in stock '.
2	once i saw the reviews i thought it a good idea to contact by email to see when my order was to be fulfilled as it had been 0 days and no communication .
2	well what a surprise , the next_day i received a reply , but it '_s not good news .
2	it seems the manufactures don_'_t make the model any more , so why is it still listed as being ' in stock '.
2	have asked for a full_refund but don_'_t expect i '_ll get that in the next 0 days .
2	having had suspect memory product in the past ( received without_any form of packaging ) from other so called uk dealers , i decided to buy something that was presented in a retail pack .
2	this at_least gives some hope that it is not a chinese copy and is a genuine product although like everything it '_s still made in china .
2	delivery and communication from ivoryegg was very good and i will consider_using again for future .
2	usb_stick works just fine .
2	this particular sandisk blade has slight curve moulded body making easier to grip when unplugging .
2	ordered a magimix 0000 , cheapest price found , even cheaper_than ebay , conformation within minutes , delivery date received by email , delivery on time .
2	product is brand_new ( not refurb ).
2	everything was as should be when ordering on line .
2	would use this company again .
2	i ordered my keys at monday_lunchtime , and they dropped through my letterbox on tuesday_afternoon .
2	i '_ll certainly be using them again .
2	having flown ryanair ( ughhh ), and easyjet ( ok ), these_guys seem so much more friendly and efficient .
2	booking , choosing the various_options ( seat position , meals , baggage ) and boarding were all simple online .
2	on board there was plenty of legroom , and the overhead lockers were roomy .
2	two criticisms : even_though we ' d checked - in online , we still had to queue at specific desks to hand over the luggage ; apart_from saving £_00 , there was no advantage .
2	there were a lot of emails between booking and take - off , that didn_'_t tell me anything i needed to know .
2	overall we were pleasantly_surprised with the experience , and they will be our first choice in future .
2	one strand of quidco is getting discounts or cashback from many retailers - admittedly the amounts can be small .
2	but the main benefit is that it acts as a price comparison site for many services , and then gives you the commission that would have gone to the agent ( compare the meerkat , confused . com or whoever ).
2	i '_ve just picked_up £_00 for renewing my car insurance , as well as getting the lowest_price anywhere .
2	give it a go - you ' re daft not to .
2	what i ordered , when i ordered it , and a good price .
2	only thing was checking out .
2	wasnt easy paying the discount price .
2	would need to use the site a couplke more times .
2	really handy .
2	normally find what i am looking for pretty quick .
2	would definately go back to the branch on crow rd , glasgow .
2	took my car in a day early , swaped another tyre around for me , and were prompt and pleasent to talk to .
2	got to be one of the first times i have experienced this at a tyre garage .
2	the item arrived in good time , good communication and a fair price for he product when compared with other_outlets
2	this company is great .
2	it is very competitive , you really don_'_t have to check other_sites for cheaper prices .
2	right on time !
2	there '_s absolutely no other booking site available !!
2	!
2	like your prices and the service was great - refreshing surprise to have no_hassle .
2	one of the quickets mail order companies i have ever done businees with .
2	complete with full instructions as well .
2	can '_t fault .

2	great service with no_problems at all and the points for buying is a nice_touch
2	they took my order - confirmed my order - rang me to see when i needed by and could get hold of me to so emailed me .
2	the product is 00 / 00 was very well_packed .
2	i would recommend this company to anyone .
2	good prices , as_described , quick delivery .
2	i will_definitely be using again and recommending , send me some business_cards .
2	their service is always excellent , i have never found any cause for complaint and their staff are really helpful , particularly sammie_taylor who was really efficient .
2	i can '_t speak too highly of them .
2	exceptional value for the money
2	ordered pair of bib_shorts - excellant turnaround but wrong_colour !
2	returned shorts at my expense and had to wait another week before my order was finally completed .
2	no comunication at all from firm .
2	no recompense for insured / recorded return delivery even_though this had been promised !
2	polaroid pretty well invented the polarised lens and these glasses show it .
2	clear and glare free , good for driving , fishing etc .
2	and at a very good price from the sunglasses_shop .
2	delivery was also quick with the glasses safely_packaged .
2	all in all , i '_m very happy .
2	had problems acctvating card , spoke to customer service , said the card would be accivated within the next 00_hours , went to use the card more than 00_hours after the call , no money on the card & had to cancel purchase , this was very emarissing as it was for my wife '_s birhday , sent an email reply to mazuma but not had any reply , not tried the card since , feel this has_been a very bad experince
2	i can '_t even begin to describe the experience of these utter idiots .
2	in simple terms i ordered a double_bed almost three_months_ago and they damaged it .
2	had to have another ordered which was delayed and i '_ve been trying to get the faulty item returned five times now .
2	i '_ve wasted hours of my time waiting in and calling them on their so called helpline that takes an average of forty_minutes to answer .
2	all to no_avail .
2	they even lied and said they ' d been to the address and that the item had been collected !!!
2	the mail order sender is of no help either .
2	the problem is they have a captive public who can '_t choose any alternative so you ' re at their mercy .
2	the next pick_up us arranged for next saturday .
2	they have so much to choose from and whenever i order the goods arrive quickly , well_packaged and in perfect_condition .
2	online ordering is easy and there are a number of payment options including paypal .
2	they even send you a text_message on the day of delivery .

2	all in all a great place to shop .
2	delivered on time great guitar very good value .
2	thankyou will use gear0music . com in future .
2	i received my glasses today - really good quality , superfast delivery and excellent value - thanks a lot
2	well its good to see that not every one is happy but that is what this site is about i '_m
2	guess i '_m one of the lucky_ones you can only judge it and leave a review on your own
2	experience and if to be honest it dose seem a lucky dip
2	brilliant paid with paypal saved money fuel and car_park only cost £ 0 . 00 postage and the flash was in excellent condition delivered to my door by royal_mail awsome
2	we ordered michael_buble tickets on next_day royal_mail , no show by 0 . 00 called them and they sorted replacements straight_away , absolutely fantastic will be using again , thank_you
2	like most new cars , there is no spare ( just one of those cans to fill your damaged tyre ) or the hassle of fitting a temporary tyre so you can drive to a garage to get the job fixed .
2	tyres on the drive removed this hassle by coming to me .
2	the time frame was excellent
2	and the service was professional and courteous .
2	i would recommend without_hesitation .
2	i know another of my tyres is at 0mm and will need replacing soon but i wasn_'_t conned_into having it done on the same visit , i '_m confident that i wasn_'_t ripped_off !
2	thank_you mike who did a great job !

2	nothing too much_trouble .
2	great service , fast delivery and at the right price
2	easy to order , fast and efficient service ,

2	i really like the best price guarantee and the free products with each order .
2	i ordered a magnetic prescription_glasses .
2	i received them promptly , but the product was damaged in transit .
2	i e_- mailed them straight_away informing that the product was broken .
2	they had a quick investigation and were satisfied that the product was damaged in post and so they immediately assured me that the replacement was on the way .
2	i was very pleased with polite response and decided to write the review straight_away , i will soon receive the replacement .
2	very very good service .
2	we recently_moved_house and contacted orange in plenty of time to arrange to have our line connected and our number transferred . as requested the bt_engineer arrived the day before we moved in to connect up the phoneline and broadband service this was the 00 feb .
2	we were told it would take a week to ten days for our line to " stabilize " and get up to speed . as i am typing this now on the 00 march i am awaiting a bt_engineer to call tomorrow to rectify the faulty line we have finally been told is the problem .
2	to date i have lost_count of the time and effort that has_gone in to attempting to get orange that we dont need a new router ( sent but made no difference ) our line doesnt need " resetting " and allowing to settle for three_days . but surely the " best " one was ringing on thursday last_week to be told we were scheduled a call from the level0 team ( the " experts ") between_0am and 0pm i rang at 0pm and was not aware of this call being scheduled , anyway 0pm came and went and suprise no call , i phoned again and was told by an expert ( but not in customer relartions ) oh_yes i knew your router was delayed so i didn_'_t bother calling you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2	however i was not ringing them for that reason so obviously telepathy is not a strong point at orange .
2	it is my intention as soon as is humanly and contractually possible to leave both orange home and mobile , and i have been a customer for over 0 years as i feel totally let_down by this supposedly " blue_chip " company
2	my existing computer has slowly been dying over the last_week , so i decided it was time to bite the bullet and replace it . i looked at various_websites , and was delighted to see my ideal replacement on the aria site with 0 + in stock . i placed my order , requested collection and paid for the system and a cyborg mouse , received my confirmation_email_stating that i would receive an email_confirming that my order was ready for collection within the next couple of hours . as i had a previous engagement that afternoon i toddled up to manchester , preempting the email . when i arrived at the counter i was informed that it was 00 days wait for systems , i was not happy , i enquired_about a refund and was told " have to speak to sales on monday ".
2	i rang sales this morning and spoke to a young_man called steven with every intention of cancelling my order as i was unhappy with the way i had been dealt_with up to then ( no telephone answering on a saturday ?, dark_ages aria ) and i need a replacement before 00 days . what a difference , i was told i could have my system tomorrow if i was happy to build it myself and as i have previously built all my systems this was not a problem , but was an ideal_solution to my problem , whilst this mat not fall within everyones capability to build a system for me personally its fine . and i will be quite happy to deal with aria again .
2	you can trust this site to offer very competitive_prices and rapid delivery .
2	why go_anywhere_else for all your battery orders ?
2	very good communications before i made the order .
2	very quick delivery .
2	the items were of excellent quality and even better_than i imagined .
2	very good value and easy to put_together .
2	can '_t recommend highly_enough .
2	i stumbled_across blackleaf and i '_m glad i did ... a huge_range of familiar brands , i was spoilt for choice .
2	i '_ll definitely use again .
2	my son asked for a zoom_lens and sent me the link to digitalrev which i hadn_'_t heard of previously .
2	i would thoroughly_recommend .

2	i spoke to chris at abbey_garden sales as i had some questions about the type of lawnmower that would suit my garden .
2	he was very polite and knowledgable and gave_me the name of three potential mowers which i might want to look at .
2	i went back to the web shop and found it very easy to navigate .
2	i chose a masport mower and checkout was very quick and straightforward the mower arrived the next_day and i was cutting my lawn within 0 mins of its arrival .
2	a mower isn_'_t something you buy every_month so i can '_t say i will buy again any time soon , but i would recommend this company .
2	there prices are good and they obviously know about what they sell .
2	i have suffered from painful knees due to osteoarthritus for three years .
2	their product ' rosehip capsules ' offers a money back guarantee that it will relieve the pain .
2	with nothing to lose i ordered some and within a week the pain had gone .
2	i have since tried various of their products and they all do what they say .
2	most online stores are fine most of the time ; what sorts out the really good from the just ordinary and downright bad is how well they cope when things don_'_t go_wrong .
2	when i returned a pair of trousers to swap for a different size the ones i wanted were on back order , and that quickly slipped to ' no_longer available '.
2	but facewest hunted round and found a source - i suspect about the last pair in the country !
2	they ' re one of the really good ones .
2	waste of time getting this company to pick you up .
2	i waited nearly 0 hours to be picked_up spoilt my holiday
2	item arrived first_class signed for delivery .
2	no_problems there .
2	vast_range of products at very competitive_prices .
2	notification of order processing is excellent and delivery is fast .
2	highly_recommended .
2	excellent service , prompt delivery , thoroughly_recommended
2	they had exactly the product i wanted ( lenovo c000 0gb all in one pc ) whereas most online vendors seemed to be out of stock .
2	i paid extra for delivery on a specified day and that is when it arrived .
2	very pleased with the product - was easy to set_up ( and i am no tech wizard ) and getting used to windows 0 , which some people say is difficult , didn_'_t seem bad .
2	overall , completely_satisfied with laptops direct
2	the drinkshop offered the best price and quick delivery on one of my favourite wines - d ' arenberg '_s stump jump - and also didn_'_t require us to order a full case ( we ordered 0 bottles this time ).
2	very happy with the product and service and it arrived exactly when they said it would .
2	excellent all_round regards alan
2	this firm is something else the only way they could get faster is to read your mind . i '_m_sure one day they will send your purchase before you even think of it yourself once again thank_you excellent service regards alan .
2	a big thank_you to all car_leasing especially matt who made a possibly stressful experience seem quite easy !
2	thinks couldn_'_t have gone_smoother and the car waiting for me on delivery day when i arrived in the office at 0 . 00am !
2	kind_regards_steve
2	excellent range of products .
2	the web_site was very easy to navigate .
2	the items i purchased were of good value and were delivered quickly .

2	valuebasket . com offered the best price plus free delivery .
2	the service i received was 0_*.
2	i was kept_informed of my order from the time i placed my order , until i received it .
2	the delivery was excellent .
2	i was given a 0hr time_slot as to when i would receive my parcel and it was delivered within that time_slot .
2	nobody could wish for better prices and service from a company .
2	having purchased a breitling earlier in the year which developed a minor fault , quickly repaired by watchfinder under their warranty , i have now purchased a cartier tank francaise , which has a new cartier strap and full cartier service document giving a years warranty .
2	the watch not only looks_like new one , with the warranty might as well be a new one but thanks to watchfinder not at new price !
2	once again i visited watchfinder '_s premises to do the deal and received the same high_standard of service from tom as i had from james on the first occasion .
2	if i add further to my collection i will_definitely be going back .
2	fast delivery and cheapest prices
2	excellent company to deal with .

2	), and had a thoroughly_enjoyable flight .
2	our hotel was fine , not glamorous , but clean , functional and friendly ---- all you need yes ?
2	food was patchy , but sometimes very good indeed .
2	flight home ---- well ok i ( as an aviation enthusiast ) paid the extra to sit where i wanted to , so bit of an advantage there !)
2	great flight home , early !!!!
2	and would not_hesitate to book with them again !
2	needed some party stuff in a hurry for twin grandchildren .

2	ordered from serenataflowers . com based_upon web_site reviews .
2	got a text the day after the flowers were supposed to have been delivered " flowers have been left securely at the front of the property ".
2	flowers never appeared .
2	my gran ( age 00 ) lives in a multi - storey block of flats .
2	and seems that the flowers were left_outside in a public area .
2	what a joke .
2	i contacted customer_support 0 days ago .
2	no answer .
2	thye no_longer offer a telephone complaints line .
2	no surprise .
2	contacted them again today .
2	don_'_t trust them .

2	i was attracted to ambient because of the feedback on the website .
