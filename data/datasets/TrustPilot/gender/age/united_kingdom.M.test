0	pre_- order prices are great
0	highly_recommended
0	i was going to give 0_stars because every now and again i got a problem with my order .. but then i realize that all the problems i had it was never the website '_s fault , and always due to some problem ( most being lack of drivers ) of the shop that i ordered the food .
0	so hungryhouse has achieve what it was supposed to be .
0	an easy to use website with plenty of associated shops to chose from wherever you are in uk ...
0	and the new feature ( express delivery in 00_minutes or money back ) works_perfectly and the customer service is not bad either !

0	i always use amazon , i also have no problem using any of their third_party sellers because the service is always good .
0	this company is second to none , a caring approach which is lacking is similar companies .
0	i have been using this company for many_years as i care for my elderly_parents , they are always caring , friendly and are willing to go the extra_mile .
0	when im away from home i have used the website to order the stuff i need for my parents and it has always arrived in good time .
0	i am on first name terms with the staff at the branch i visit , and its this personal_touch that keeps me coming_back and i wouldn_'_t ever go_anywhere_else .
0	a genuinely good company , so rare_these days .
0	the service and product are both first_class !
0	my wife_loves_her solitaire engagement_ring which would have been at_least twice the price from a national high_street jeweller .
0	there is no need to worry_about ordering online as everything is 000_% genuine and trustworthy - i did have some intrepidations beforehand .
0	i have had the ring independantly valued at beav ******* ks when we took it in to get cleaned prior to the wedding and they commented how nice the ring was and asked where i got it from .
0	comes with certification .
0	i have recommended it to friends already !
0	!
0	i have been using supplementwarehouse . com for all my strength training needs .
0	their variety of supplements and whats better_than free shipping , free products !.
0	supplementwarehouse . com will_continue to have my business for as long as live .
0	i would recommend their services to anyone for their supplement_needs .
0	not one glitch , great communication and the product is exactly as i spec ' d and paid for !
0	buy from pc_specialist - they get my highest_recommendation !
0	this is the worst company ever !!
0	i want to cut my contract with t - mobile as they don_'_t give you your moneys_worth .
0	i have been with t - mobile for several_years_now i these problem that are occurring seem to becoming more frequent meaning every other day for the last 0 months .
0	normally you would get full network when your in a open space but on the other handy my network_coverage is always being cut_off .
0	sometimes i cant make a phone_call because there '_s something wrong with the server .
0	my phone_calls always being cut mid way through a important to professional people or just general conversations to my friends .
0	and then at the end of the month t - mobile then want to charge me a ridiculous_amount of money for my monthly plan that i haven_'_t even been able to you use to the full extent .
0	t - mobile , you are ripp offs we should compensated for are losses and inconveniences !!
0	there customer service is just as bad with there rude members off staff that don_'_t even seem to bothered to help you when your asking for a little assistants , and most of them cant even speak understandable english with there heavy accents , because it seems like i speaking to someone on the other side of the world .
0	and don_'_t think when it comes to the end of my contract i will hesitate to leave your useless company !
0	!
0	if you can be bother to get back to me ( which i doubt ), email me on ; samanthajs0 @_yahoo ,. com
0	miss samantha .
0	good value , great product and speedy service !
0	sell your laptop offered the best price for the laptop and it was also pleasing to note that profits are treated as charity donations .
0	i would have no_hesitation of using this service again .
0	after booking the services required i tried printing off the labels .
0	i had trouble because my printer died to put it simply lol .
0	after getting home i asked [_name_] ( not me lol ) if he could refund me the full_amount .
0	it was done without_any trouble and we had a little laugh afterwards as well
0	i love playing with my ferrofluid !
0	it '_s so much fun and all my friends are so impressed .

0	thanks gamesbites !
0	i will_definatly be using your service again and i will also recommend to friends !
0	because amazon sell many of their products through third_party sellers , you never know if you ' re actually ordering from amazon themselves or someone_else .
0	when my order arrived poorly_packaged and late from a company i had never_heard of , i wasn_'_t very happy !
0	great service provided , item arrived in as_described condition and on time .
0	had no_problems and would use again to get a good price .
0	i have discussed with 00 + oisc registered immigration consultant , no one was confident on my case , ( i had long absent 000 + days contentious at one stretch due to my father illness ), most of them suggested me to go for extension rather_than ilr .
0	but , when i spoke to ali & vaibhav , they were highly confident and realistic approach ( they have successfully dealt_with many similar case ) .
0	i am_glad i have come_across with imperial , otherwise i would have to wait for 0 more years for my ilr and addition tier_0 renew ( with cost of 0k tax to my pocket ) .
0	i have got my ilr on compassionate ground on someday at croydon peo .
0	thanks to ali who spend all day along with me in croydon peo , and vaibhav highly experienced consultant who advised me and gave confidence at every_stage .
0	i highly_recommend there service , 0_star is very less

0	god pice and quick delivery , all you need this days
0	a good and fast service .
0	the customer service was great , the virtual terminal did the job i was looking for , just found a cheaper service else where .
0	i remember when signing_up to payment sense i was told i could terminate the contract anytime .
0	so emailed to cancel my service to be told i have to pay for the next 0 months , this is very annoying , as i can '_t use the account but still being charged .
0	it may only be £_00 but its a little_harsh to charge me for something , i can no_longer use .
0	i needed a powerboard for my tv ( fix # 0 lasted some months , but a chip blew and that was getting silly ).
0	lg were useless .
0	lg official engineers quoted £_000 for entire internals ( as that is what they could get from lg - i think the tv cost £_000 ).
0	flattvparts . co . uk had the powerboard , dave confirmed it was correct and i received it the next_morning .
0	excellent service !
0	thank_you :)

0	good tender steaks , huge chicken_breasts all delivered on time .
0	saw these fitflop due shoes at full price .
0	i '_m usually 0 . 0 shoe_size but tried them in a shop and they were big .

0	pre_- ordered the last of us from simplygames as it was the cheapest price around and still came with the pre_- order dlc .
0	received notification when the game was shipped and it arrived a day early !
0	received the code for the dlc via_email which was sent out almost_instantly .
0	after pre_- ordering from several different retailers in the past that had a ' guaranteed launch day delivery ' for games only for them to arrive a few_days late .
0	was very pleased when simplygames were the first to actually honour that promise .
0	couldn_'_t ask for an easier transaction and would definitely recommend the company to anyone .
0	bf0 worked in seconds !!
0	!
0	i just wanted to thank_you for the outstanding service i received when purchasing my wedding_ring .
0	having rung up at 0pm , i was very impressed to get straight through to a real_person at this time of evening .
0	furthermore marianne could not have been more helpful answering all my questions with authority and professionalism .
0	once the ring had been ordered , it was posted out the very next_day and i received it the following_day .
0	although the ring was just what i wanted , it was a fraction too small .
0	however , the service provided by marlows was again second to none ; the ring was resized at no extra_cost and was back with me within three_days .
0	i would like to congratulate marlow '_s on their excellent customer service and products .
0	literally the worst customer_care skills in the history of the world .
0	do not use this company for anything , ever .
0	totally abusive , cheeky , sarcastic and offensive .
0	this company have obviously never_heard of customer_care and they dont deserve to be recognised as a supplement selling business .
0	stay_away at all costs !
0	a very good selection and fast efficient service
0	ordered a quantity of film only to realise the breakdown was wrong - i emailed a request to change the breakdown of film type and they immediately responded .
0	i also received my film the very next_day - awesome .
0	needed a new headphone lead , they had it in stock and was delivered to me 00hrs_later .
0	the free sweets was a nice_touch .
0	will buy from again !

0	- det_kunne jeg gøre bedre selv !
0	0 . : der_er åbenbart også forskelsbehandling på servicen om man betaler med kreditkort / kontant mod at man betaler med_et giftvoucher .
0	vinen var dog rigtig_god .
0	bestilte_et sæt sko , overførte penge til deres konto med_min netbank , og_havde skoene 0 hverdage efter .

0	arrived quickly with no_problems .
0	muscle_foods quite literally have the best service going .
0	there isnt a bad_word i can say about the quality of the products , the flexibility of their service , or the customer_care standards .
0	i have sampled a variety of products from top quality chicken to addictive nut_butters , and all surpass my expectations .
0	thanks for the constant premium service you provide , i see no reason to ever buy my meat from a supermarket again :) i recommend to all my clients ( as a pt ), and almost all of them are converts to the gospel of muscle_foods !
0	best price out there for ghd '_s ( bought for my wife for xmas , hope she '_s not reading this .......) and were delivered within a couple of days - thoroughly_recommended , and will_definitely use again !
0	thanks :-)
0	great and fast option
0	excellent print quality , customer service and very well_packaged !
0	after checking several places in and around london and a few online we came_across just poles .
0	we rang them several_times to ask for advice and they were always friendly and helpful .
0	the price was great so we placed an order and awaited the curtains .
0	there was a fair lead time but i guess they ' re pretty busy and we weren_'_t in a rush .
0	when the curtains arrived we were delighted by the quality and how great they look in our living_room .
0	all in all a very good company that we ' d fully recommend !
0	adzuna is a really simple site to use and it gives you accurate search_results for property ( or jobs and cars ) without asking you too many questions first .
0	i think that this is important because often you don_'_t want to spend time with lots of filters before you find the property you want to look at .
0	i really like the friend map feature where you can see where your friends on facebook hang out also , it makes property search a lot more engaging and relevant to you .
0	overall , i would definitely recommend .
0	it '_s easy to use and gives you the information you want very quickly .
0	i '_ve dealt_with aquatics warehouse on a couple of occasions now and can '_t complain_about the service i '_ve received .
0	the customer service is excellent , the response time to email correspondence is very quick and even after some time from first buying something from the company and inquiring_about a new part i needed they remembered me and were able to send the part free of charge .
0	one of the best companies i '_ve dealt_with over the internet .
0	prices are very reasonable and they have a great variety of stock .
0	fully recommend their service , thanks guys !
0	recommend the company to anyone .
0	there '_s always good offers , plenty to choose from and hassle_free ordering with very quick delivery .
0	can '_t complain !
0	i can not believe_how bad the customer service has_been with tap portugal .
0	they lost my luggage on a flight from the uk to brazil , and nobody tried to help , answered the phone or replied to my emails .
0	eventually my case arrived 0 days_later as i was heading home , and still 0_weeks on nobody from tap in brazil , the uk or in portugal will reply to my emails .
0	as for the flight - the plane was fairly old with a ' entertainment ' that was awful for a 00 hour flight , and uncomfortable seats .
0	this will be my one and only experience of flying with tap .
0	i ordered this globe 0 - 0_weeks before fathers_day , as it looked like a really good present that my dad would like .
0	all seemed to be going well , however the passed and the globe didn_'_t arrive .
0	i decided to email globee to find out what was happening with my order .
0	after 0_weeks they still didn_'_t even bother to reply .
0	i have now emailed them to cancel the order , as i '_m not confident whether this is even a genuine retailer .
0	really really disappointed with the service .
0	don_'_t waste your time with globee !
0	i purchased a samsung 00 " led_tv from pixmania as the price was very good .
0	the tv arrived 0 days_later , which was good , however i noticed that the tv had been shipped from france , which seemed odd .
0	i then went to set the tv up - there was no uk mains_lead , just a 0 pin continental_plug - i decided to persevere and set the tv by using a mains_plug i had , only to discover that the tv tuner was made for austria , germany and switzerland .
0	there is no uk tuner facility which means no freeview hd .
0	i '_m sending this tv back , and will not be dealing_with pixmania again , as the goods are not as_described .
0	very misleading and very poor service .
0	really happy with the quality of service offered by g wizz , who sub contract our work out to city_link and ups at amazingly competitive_rates .
0	we have now been using them for a year and are delighted .
0	any_problems with the actual carriers are handled for you , and all claims have been dealt_with , on items for which we have taken out their insurance option , which is unheard of with couriers .
0	great service - keep_up the good work !
0	!
0	i went in to the store after_seeing a tv on their website and phoning the store .
0	the salesman was really helpful and explained about the tv and told me that there was a free 0 year_guarantee if i purchase the item in the store .
0	i went in and had a full demo of what the tv could do and there was even free 0d_glasses as well .
0	well_done and thank_you to paul who helped_me
0	ordered twice_now for in store collection .
0	easy online , stock arrives in store on time , but the service received in the poole store has really put me off .
0	for a company that bleats on about how great their customer service is , disappointing experience both_times i '_ve been in to collect .
0	arrange pick_up for southampton now !
0	!
0	great service when buying from there preferred seller for certain music - indigostarfish . they have delivered cd '_s within 0 days on 0 occasions without having to pay the extra fast delivery charge .
0	ordered a dyson_vacuum on there website at 0pm and it was delivered to me the very next_day before 00am !
0	! what service - and the delivery was completely free . sent me my tracking_number which was deliverd by ups .
0	great to deal with . thanx
0	i went on their website and bought a pair of dj cd players - or so i thought .
0	technical problems their end prevented both of my credit / debit_cards working , it would not connect to the 0 d secure screen and they would not accept my payment , nor would they accept payment over the phone .
0	the items were in my basket whilst i was going back and forth with the store and my card issuers to try and identify the problem ... which of course was their website , but they at first denied this .
0	then the cd players disappeared out of my basket , and into another persons !
0	at that point , after_contacting their levenshulme store again for the umpteenth time and complained as i had been the first person to try and buy these , " riz " confirmed that their technical_team had identified a fault connecting with the 0 d secure payment stage and that this other person couldn_'_t pay for these either .
0	i then said that i was very worried that i had been trying to pay for this item for over an_hour and making numerous phone_calls , helping identify a problem on their website , only for it to then be fixed and someone_else then being_able to buy them from under my feet .
0	there was talk of taking the item off sale or refunding the new buyer if the payment went through .
0	and of course , due to me telling cash_converters of the problem , they got it fixed and this other person was able to pay in the end and they left me high and dry without a care in the world , after spending 0 hours and £_00 on phone_calls to try buy the items myself as i had got there first .
0	i will never see a deal like that again and they couldn_'_t care less despite me being there first and helping them fix their website , which in turn helped someone_else get these over me .
0	thanks a bunch
0	update 00 - 00 - 00 -
0	my issue was never resolved .
0	i was sent a different piece of equipment that i reluctantly_agreed to , at a slightly reduced price - which turned_out to be faulty !!!!
0	i had to wait_until 0pm one day to have this collected for a refund .
0	i then saw the same models of the items , that cash_converters made sure i missed out on due to their mess up , on their website again .
0	i suggested to resolve the issue , i should have those at the same price that i should have been able to buy the original items i wanted , that their website prevented me from doing in the first place , as they were basically the same .
0	this should have been fair_enough , even if it did cost them a bit of money , they created this issue after all - that is if they gave a toss about customer service of course .
0	they refused .
0	they basically on the phone said they had " tried and failed to appease me and resolve the issue ".
0	the most dire customer service i have ever received in my life .
0	my follow_up email to their head_office was totally_ignored too .
0	i am still struggling to believe a huge company , sponsoring a premier_league football_team , can treat people like this when they have cocked_up all along .
0	a score of 0 on this site , scraping acceptable , is pretty bad and it shows that their priority is money money money - not customer service .
0	so my message is , god help you if a purchase goes_wrong !!!
0	oh and they still_haven_'_t explained why they originally couldn_'_t simply take the items off their website until the payment part of their site was fixed .
0	really unhappy with this whole_experience which was completely preventable by cash_converters and has marred previously pretty good experiences of using them .
0	a shame .
0	bought a cd_player on their website , but the cd_player sent was different to the one described on their website , it was a lesser model .
0	i emailed the store to complain and say i would keep the cd_player , as it seemed to work , if i could have a small refund back due to their listing error and sending me a cheaper model .
0	i had nothing back from them .
0	i eventually had to go through paypal just to get the small discount i requested .
0	then a couple of weeks_later the cd_player , that was sent incorrectly , failed on me and no_longer powered on .
0	i emailed the store again - asking what the warranty is on these items , again completely_ignored .
0	i also emailed their head_office - completely_ignored .
0	so i have not only been basically sent the wrong item , it has failed on me within 0 or 0_weeks of barely any use .
0	i have sent numerous_emails to the store and their head_office and i have had not even 0 word back from them ..... shocking .
0	i would ring the store but i am that wound up about it i am worried_about losing my temper over the phone .
0	buying something over the internet really should not be this much hassle and now i have thrown_away my money .
0	thanks very much .
0	ordered some sound magic headphones recently , website was excellent , great detail in the products i was interested in , easy navigation through products and website in general , quick and easy order / payment process and to top it off next_day delivery .
0	thanks very much guys keep_up the good work .
0	will_definatley be purchasing products from here again
0	i had no idea what i was doing , all i wanted was my website set_up in the root directory .

0	once i got through on the live_chat ( that took about 0 minutes , but i am pretty relaxed , i went and had some tea ) bogdan came on and made everything work for me .
0	he even explained why it wasn_'_t working in a way that i could understand !
0	i would recommend 000 to anyone

0	jeg_bestilte_en_pakke med hjælp fra shopusa og_det_hele gik fint , indtil de sendte pakken fra deres terminal .. pakken er nu væk på 0 uge og_efter 0 - 0 mails hører jeg_ikke fra dem , og_kan_ikke få fat på dem på hverken mail eller telefon .
0	kan absolut ikke anbefale shopusa til nogen , for der_er ingen hjælp hvis din pakke bliver væk , så lader de som ingenting .
0	excellent service and an amazing stag_do in krakow .
0	we couldnt have asked for more , top work all_round .
0	the venue and organisation was top_notch , we felt looked after every_step of the way .
0	i will be recommending them in future to everyone !
0	thanks !
0	!
0	i needed 0 new front tyres for my vauxhall meriva .
0	i have gone with blackcircles for my previous tyres but etyres . co . uk had the same ' c ' rated tyres for a much_better price so i went with them .
0	they came to my work and fitted the tyres saving me the bother of taking the car to the garage .
0	would highly_recommend .
0	firstly - it is disgraceful that you can only write comments if you are satisfied .
0	so repairs0 block out comments if they do not like them ?
0	?
0	they kept my phone for 0_weeks when they promise to repair in one day .
0	it then took them another 0_weeks to refund my money .
0	i sent my iphone_0s in for a screen repair which they received on the 0th_november .
0	they told me a week_later they were awaiting a part and the phone would be with me by the end of the week .
0	this came and went , and i called to chase .
0	still no parts , but they are coming in this week .
0	again nothing .
0	i was then told that they had no idea when they would get parts in and i had to wait indefinitely .
0	they finally sent the phone back to me on 00th_november , it took them until the 0th_december to refund my money .
0	they constantly promised that a manager would call me back but never did , and they ignored all of my emails .
0	i would never consider_using or recommending this company .
0	they never once were understanding or apologetic and simply kept telling_me it was not their fault .
0	they will also promise to refund , and then will not investigate for 00 working_days if anything_goes wring .
0	utter , utter ineptitude , they do not deserve to be in business .
0	i look_forward to seeing them on watchdog .
0	i can '_t fault physio_supplies in any way , everything was easy to find , order and pay ; my order arrived on time , all correctly packaged , and the product is of very good quality .
0	would use again , definitely .
0	fastkeys have been fantastic .
0	order placed at 00pm , despatched next_day , arrived the day after .
0	can '_t complain and fantastic helpful service !
0	will_definitely use again and recommend them to our internal buying department and maintenance team !
0	i received my print within 00 from ordering .
0	very easy to use website !
0	i will be back !
0	i ordered my smurfette soft toy on friday and it was delivered by saturday .
0	the customer service lady rebecca was really helpful and i felt that she went out of her way to help me .
0	excellent service , email_updates_regarding the order and fast delivery - definately recommend ...
0	mp0_player as gift - so cheap and its worthless - better not give gifts !
0	utterly disappointed ... my kid was like - what the **** is this ?
0	its useless !
0	cheaper , dispatched earlier and delivered on time !
0	free delivery and easy to return if unwanted .
0	customer service is amazing too .
0	thanks deep_blue outstanding service and pricing as always .
0	i ordered this the day before i was going on a stag_do at 0pm and was worried that the next_day it wouldn_'_t arrive but i was wrong it did .
0	absolutley_amazing couldn_'_t believe my eyes when it arrived .
0	will_definateley order from them again .
0	making the order was so easy i spoke to a scottish guy_who was very friendly and informative , mclachann was his_name i believe .
0	arrived at the airport , very friendly chauffeur collected my vehicle ( considering the time ) and i as lucky_enough on return to have the same chauffeur bring my car back to me .
0	would be more than happy to use again in the future .
0	basically the courier decided to leave my box on my " porch " i live next to a busy pathway and when i got home item was not there .
0	this is not myproteins fault !
0	but
0	i have emailed them twice , in regards to my missing item and have had no response , hermes who delivered my item responded within 00_hours advising me to contact myprotein , as they will not deal with me directly .
0	hopefully me posting this will get me a response , as its a joke .
0	i have been using myprotein for easily around 0 years , and have never had a problem , their customer service is normally excellent .
0	so not quite sure why it is the opposite now !
0	bought a copy of battlefield_0 limited_edition russian_version as i missed out when game was released and wanted the extra perks of the game .
0	after paying received code in less_than 0 minutes if not instant activated and started installing .
0	changed language to english and started_playing no_problems and for those interested the physical warfare pack is included with the russian_version its the same key as the main game unlike_other_places who have to email you a seperate key , will_definitely buy from again .
0	:)
0	great price match option , got what i wanted for cheaper just by copying the url .
0	also had all the sugar free syrup flavors i was looking for in one place .
0	it '_s a real_shame so many companies choose to use yodel .
0	i '_ve had the misfortune of dealing_with them after buying goods from both ' very ' and ' carphone_warehouse '.
0	they really don_'_t do good service , or to think of it , anything at all .
0	it '_s good to see that they are making lots of money and i think this is evident from the massive and no doubt costly company rebrand exercise .
0	it has to be said , the brand itself is pretty_cool , but what good is a catchy brand_name when the service ' delivered ' or in this case not , is nothing but appalling .
0	every_single time i have had a yodel delivery there has_been a multitude of problems .
0	delivery men saying that they knocked when they didn_'_t , leaving expensive goods literally on the door_step , despite the fact the path across the front of our house is used by everyone living on the street , and even deliveries not showing up at all .
0	their customer_services team are rude and unhelpful and i genuinely think that the delivery staff must play_football and other sports activities with the parcels .
0	last time i checked the corners of an iphone box were pointed , that well know corner shape , but after yodel took my brand_new £_000 iphone 0 on board , they seemed intent on reshaping the box into , let '_s say a more rounded design .
0	an_absolute_joke of a business , avoid if you can .
0	the only positive thing is that i '_m clearly not the only one who has felt the need to vent some truly disgraceful issues .
0	ok yodel , so on your website you say :
0	we look different and feel different because at yodel we truly believe there '_s a better way of delivering .
0	a way that gives clients and customers at home or in businesses the service they want and need .
0	and at yodel , we have the scale and capacity to make it happen .
0	and we do so with a smile !
0	you certainly do believe that there '_s a better way of delivering don_'_t you .
0	i ' d probably stick with the old concept of getting a parcel from a to b , in one piece and on time .
0	we want and need our parcels on time .
0	we don_'_t need late or missed deliveries , damaged goods , rude and unhelpful staff etc .
0	you don_'_t make it happen and i '_ve never seen a smile .
0	you might be laughing to yourselves when you see the company profits .
0	most of us have to laugh , else we ' d probably cry .
0	... maybe revise your ' about us section '?
0	oh and this did make me laugh ( also from your website )
0	' at yodel we really give you something to shout about .'
0	- yes yodel , yes you do .
0	so my advice to yodel , stop spraying your vans green and start reinvesting your profits into a good team of people .
0	i might also suggest a quick google of what a delivery company is supposed to do , it seems you ' re struggling with this concept a little .
0	thanks yodel , i hope that i never have to deal with you ever again .
0	i really cannot_praise printing . com enough .
0	they were reccomended to me by a friend who had used them several_times before .
0	as a result of hearing such good things , i used them to print all of my promotional work for a uk tour i was producing .
0	i remember smiling continuously when the print arrived as the quality was absolutely exceptionl on every_single item , from the a0_flyers to the ao posters .
0	the service and professionalism of the company and the wonderful jonathan cobb was second to none , everything was made easy , everything was exceptional value and most_importantly the work was simply brilliant .
0	have always reccomended anyone use these_guys as you can '_t go_wrong !
0	thank_you printing . com !
0	richard from the sales_team kept me in the loop all the way .
0	spoke to the guys in glasgow to check the specs .
0	great price , next delivery , no beef whatsoever !
0	i '_ll be using this site again for stuff in the future .
0	nice one everyone !
0	spink out
0	ok so i browsed a few different websites and came_across a lovely_bunch of flowers on serenata , ordered was happy to pay nearly 00 pounds .
0	wrote a little message for my mum .
0	ladies and gentlemen that was as good as it gets .
0	0 .
0	the flowers arrived in some amazon style fashion just left on my mothers door_step .
0	0 .
0	the flowers look nothing like what i ordered on the website .
0	0 .
0	i got buds , who in there right mind would give somebody buds as a gift ?
0	0 .
0	the buds are discoloured and already brown and worsening .
0	0 .
0	there was no card or message on the flowers .
0	0 .
0	they are small and pathetic
0	i have been in touch via e_- mail sent photos yet your company says the flowers are ok . no they are not i ordered flowers not discoloured dying buds .
0	i expect a full_refund and ill send the buds back and maybe one of you can give them to your mother .
0	the worst service ever , avoid like the plague .
0	i would use them again a +
0	brilliant web_site , easy and encouraging to use .
0	plenty of support available .
0	i was sceptical at first , given the low price but the end product was brilliant .
0	the sizing and the colouring were perfect .
0	if i could suggest an improvement about anything it would be to offer a personal consultation / design service for £_00 - 00 quid .
0	word of warning though make_sure uploaded images are high_quality and not cropped and resized to much otherwise they will come out pixelated .
0	thank_you .
0	i have used the site a couple of times with no issues , but when there is an issue this is where is falls down !
0	no contact with the mods or site owner since saturday - phone has_been missing for over a week !
0	does look like they even have insurance for anything like scams ridiculous !
0	even ebay realizes there are scammers about !
0	i am out £_000 with no way of replacing the item !
0	i made a cash withdrawal for £ 0000 a week_ago and still_haven_'_t been paid it .
0	they say the withdrawal has_been processed and i need to chase it up with my bank .
0	i '_ve done this and they can '_t see any credits pending which i '_ve told betfair and they say it '_s not their problem as they '_ve processed the withdrawal .
0	great , how the hell am i supposed to get my £ 0000 ???
0	?
0	on the 00th_june i bought a golf belt which should have been delivered within 0 - 0 days and now 00 days and still no sign of it .
0	i have contacted dpd who say they have never received anything and all clubhouse golf do is direct you to their pathetic tracking_system .
0	i '_ve now escalated this problem to paypal trying to get my money back but still clubhouse golf are failing to respond .
0	absolutely_shocking service and i warn anyone away from using this website !
0	this company is absolutely_terrible !
0	i purchased a gigantic piano keyboard for £_00 . 00 for my 0 year_old_son to open on christmas day and when we did it was not only damaged but it was broke .
0	i immediately emailed them and was told i would be contacted in 0 working_days .
0	that was nearly 0_weeks_ago now and i have sent another 0 emails to which i still_haven_'_t heard_anything .
0	i have also tried_contacting them 0 times on facebook and twice they have deleted my wall posts and have not responded to my status including them .
0	i am now going to take some type legal_action_against them to stop them getting away with this with other people .
0	couldn_'_t fault the service provided as product arrived on time and it was exactly how described .
0	i ordered the game and paid by bank_transfer which got approve in record time , but unfortunately it was out stock .
0	however by the time i came back the next_day it was back in stock and before the game was released so i still got the pre order bonus very happy customer : d
0	the selection was great .
0	various_sizes and able to order large_quantity as it was in stock .
0	i was amazed at the speed of delivery , within 00_hours .
0	and products were packed nicely .
0	i ordered the lens late on the sunday_night , and received the lens in great condition on the tuesday , can '_t fault the transaction at all !
0	the item was received very quickly and without_any_problems , definitely worth it
0	the shoes fit exactly as the description said , they turned_up on time and there were no issues in the process .
0	very happy customer .
0	as a returning customer , i knew what i was signing_up for and always , thoroughly pleased .
0	bought a wd mybook live duo .
0	price was the best around , tracking_information was supplied promptly and the delivery was quick .
0	the guy almost dropped it at the doorstep , but i can '_t pin that on kikatek .
0	all_round happy customer .
0	went on the website to purchase a parcel , decided to use the live_chat to get some information , and i spoke to katie , who was very helpful and efficient !
0	i would really recommend the website and the live support , and for katie '_s service i '_m_sure she should get an award !
0	she was very polite and responded well to all the queries i had about the website , thank_you katie !
0	i have been returning to as for over two years_now .
0	i have never had anything but top_class service , honest advice and always recommend them to my friends and family .
0	words won_'_t do justice to how happy i am with their service .
0	keep_up the brilliant work .
0	thanks guys
0	naveen
0	mazuma_mobile proved to be a considerably easy and quick process , within a day or two i received the necessary_documentation to post my old phone to them ( free !)
0	i received confirmation of my old_mobile reaching mazuma , and within another day or two , my cheque arrived .
0	simple
0	worked_perfectly and i could activate within_seconds of buying .
0	battlefield really is a excellent game would recommend to any one !
0	everything i '_ve ordered has_been delivered on time , including pre_- orders .
0	if it '_s out of stock , they won_'_t let you buy !
0	everything i '_ve purchased has arrived exactly as expected , when i was told it would be delivered .
0	i '_ve even expressly asked for something that wasn_'_t on their website ( 000ml snake oil ) and this was ordered in specifically as per my request .
0	can '_t fault the service , the guys seem to be around to answer your queries all the time .
0	great job guys !
0	can '_t wait for new e_- liquids .
0	had encountered an issue with the wrong type of quickdraws shipped , the problem was solved promptly and leaved me totally_satisfied .
0	i '_m confident to be their customer in the future .
0	i recently contacted adband regarding a possible donation to our charity_event .
0	since then they have been so helpful .
0	their customer service is fantastic and they are so quick to reply to any questions .
0	also there products , in our case silicone wristbands look amazing .
0	thank_you so much adband !!
0	would 000_% recommend
0	i had the phone and ipad fixed first with a stall in my local market trying to support local traders ...
0	this was no good the screen lifted from the phone and the ipad cracked as it was weak already in my opinion , i then sent both devices to gloopy where i have now had them back for a year and fixed now i am selling both devices for upgrades : d awesome customer_care and very organised as these kind if services are alien to us public it '_s nice to know every_step of your repair .
0	collected and delivered the goods on time .
0	was kept_informed of the progress_throughout .
0	very professional .
0	a ++
0	bought pink tickets at the o0_arena , london for the 00 / 00 /_0000 for my wife last christmas .
0	spent £_000 .
0	tickets were unsuccessfully delivered on 00 / 00 / 00 by royal_mail ( 0 days before the show ) to the wrong_address after i did an address change on their website 0_weeks previous after lots of worry_about not being home .
0	went to collect tickets next_day from royal_mail who stated i had to wait 00_hours before collection .
0	( friday 00 / 00 / 00 ) [ day before gig ]
0	after 0 calls to viagogo , and promised call_backs from a senior_manager ( which did not happen ) i was told just to " sort it out " as there was no other way to get into gig even_though ticketmaster offer a re - print on their website .
0	viagogo had no further details of the ticket to pass to me ( seat number , row , ticket number etc_...)
0	had to cancel train_tickets and hotel stay in london of the friday as travelling from newcastle so i could pick_up tickets the next_day .
0	picked_up tickets saturday_morning from royal_mail to discover the seats advertised as " side view " are actually " rear side view " mis_- sold as far as i am concerned .
0	all at a cost of £_000 for 0 tickets + £_00 cancelled ( non_refundable ) hotel + £_000 train_ticket journey .
0	follow me on twitter_@ danryanskinner to share your experiences of @ viagogo so we can protect others in the future of this awful service .
0	i have brought many items from just golf and i have had no_problems .
0	quick delivery , brand_names and cheap prices what more could you ask for .
0	the website offered exactly the service i was looking for and paid me promptly for my items .
0	excellent .
0	cjs_keys is the best website for cd_keys .
0	the prices for all games are best bar non and the auto_key service means you can get your key straight_away unlike_other_websites .
0	would recommend to any gamers or movie fan .
0	have used these_chaps a couple of times - great range of shades , really helpful staff , amazingly quick delivery and spot on prices .
0	can '_t recommend them enough .
0	after accidentally recieving a car_park ticket at an asda carpark i found their customer service was terrible .
0	i '_m £_00 out of pocket and they don_'_t care about thier customers .
0	store manager mike doidge - rude and not helpful .
0	customer service advisor mary - ann lied to me and couldn_'_t help
0	customer service manager william hayton - didn_'_t even phone back
0	0 days_later after i sent an email_stating i wasn_'_t going to be a customer anymore i recieved a call off someone called rob who wouldn_'_t even tell me his full name and he was as useful as a choclolate tea pot .
0	don_'_t shop at asda !!
0	!
0	ordered a few items from ffx_tools and the delivery was speedy with great quality items .
0	absolutely perfect .
0	i sent the phone on the friday and got paid on the monday .
0	no_reservations_about recommending them to anyone and they paid more than mazuma and envirofone .
0	superb and would trade with them again for sure .
0	this company has recently changed it '_s online pricing so that you can see the actual cost including taxes .
0	before it was very frustrating getting a ' bargain ' only to then have taxes , fees , baggage fees , seat fees etc added at the end , so well_done for the change .
0	i flew from leeds to southampton and back with them and on the journey back , our flight was going to be cancelled , however , they instead let us on a scottish flight and made a stop at leeds for us !
0	fantastic customer service .
0	i would use them again .
0	i have been a customer of the production_room for a very long time and i will always be one .
0	they are the only shop where when i go in , the staff will shake my hand and remember my name ( and even remember me when i phone up ).
0	this is excellent customer service in anyone '_s book .
0	they often do product demonstrations and have an excellent array of equipment to try out in store .
0	it is very important to support local_businesses like these when there are so many competitors and i like shopping there .
0	if i '_ve ever had any_problems with gear purchased , it has_been sorted without an issue .
0	the only_drawback is the lack of extended_warranty ( for what they are worth ) which is not offered here .
0	i '_m so glad i found lexmark .
0	after years of fighting with hp_printers and spending endless money on cartridges i finally found the prestige pro 000 printer with really cheap ink and a decent cost for the printer .
0	everything works , delivery is quick and i am a very happy customer .
0	what a joke - since when does next_day delivery end up not arriving the next_day when you wait in all day for it ?
0	why does the company have phone lines that either get cut_off or never answered ?
0	this company is letting down the businesses that use them to deliver their product
0	i '_ve had a mixed history with studiospares .
0	i would start by saying that the company has_been going for many_years , is an ' industry standard ' key competitor and despite what i will write in this review i would definitely use them again and again .
0	however , they use dpd to transport their parcels and this lets them down a lot .
0	i '_ve had next_day deliveries not arrive next_day , no apology from the delivery company .
0	when phoning to enquire with studiospares , they couldn_'_t get through so gave_me the number to call , which was never answered .....
0	also , they have mis_- advertised sizing of products that i have purchased resulting in too little area of an acoustic tiles product arriving ( by a long margin !)
0	but they did resolve my complaint to my satisfaction .
0	just check the size before placing an order to avoid_disappointment .
0	overall , an excellent company to deal with but the delivery service lets them down in my opinion
0	i cannot_fault this company .
0	they pay very competitive_rates in the comparison_sites , but what drew me to them was that they pay the same day of receiving the phone direct to your bank_account .
0	if you don_'_t want to pay postage , you don_'_t have to but i paid for special delivery .
0	this money then went towards my new phone !
0	thanks mazuma - i ' d use you again
0	quick delivery , recorded post and well_packaged .
0	i '_ve visited the store and called them on the phone in the past and they are always helpful and informative .
0	fast service , quick payment plans , very happy with the site , would recommend to anyone .
0	i have been a customer of affordable_supplements for a few_years_now .
0	i have always found their prices and service to be the best around .
0	the loyalty_points_scheme is great , they really know how to treat returning customers .
0	i am now a vip member which is their way of saying thank_you for my loyalty , well_done as .
0	nice fresh , bright healthy flowers .
0	just as many buds as flowers .
0	was amazed at the amount for the value .
0	next door_neighbour absolutely_loved them as well when mum invited her in to show them , then she was off to tell her mum .
0	i will be a repeat_customer 000_%.
0	i recently made an order with charterhouse for frozen_food .
0	sadly the courier company interlink let them down_badly .
0	they failed to deliver the items next working day .
0	so charterhouse offered to send replacements of what they had in stock .
0	and were assured 000_% the parcel would arrive friday ..
0	no such parcel , and i got an email from interlink informing_me i wont get my parcel until monday 00th .
0	charterhouse have issued a refund , and i believe they will be contacting interlink about there lack of service .
0	lol this company is nothing more than a joke .
0	0 attempts now to deliver time sensitive items , i ordered frozen fish_food during the bank_holiday_weekend , knowing it would not be sent out until the tuesday .
0	it was supposed to arrive wednesday , absolutely nothing and when checking the tracking page i seen it was still in the sortation facility .
0	spoke with the company i bought the food from and they looked into it , and got back to me and offered to send out replacements as they have been assured if they send a parcel out it would get to the customer today ... wrong no parcel , instead i get an email_informing_me my parcel has_been delayed and i wont get it until monday 00th .
0	well interlink after the weekend you will be known as interstink as i have been in touch with the company , they have issued a full_refund to me and they have told me they will be taking this further with your selves .
0	interlink have failed to deliver twice , wont be getting a 0rd chance .
0	well i made an order with a company for mums 00 birthday_present .
0	was sent an email on the 0th telling_me my parcel has_been sent by city_link express which is 00_hours .
0	and not to check the tracking_link until after 0pm .
0	i checked after 0 and it informed me parcel has_been scanned and is on its way to the delivery depot .
0	delivery date is thursday 0th .
0	i checked in the early hours of the morning * 0th * and still showing parcel scanned and on its way to delivery depot delivery date 0th .
0	i checked a few_times through out yesterday and no up date .
0	after 00_hours still no update on progress .
0	i was told else where that city_link only update tracking 0 times , once collected , item arrives morning of delivery and item has_been delivered .
0	pretty pathetic service if you ask me .
0	well it is now delivery day and nearly 00_hours and yep still no new tracking_details , still been scanned and on its way to delivery depot and delivery date 0th .
0	dpd kept me up to date on progress and then sent me an email giving me a 0 hour delivery slot , 0 mins into that delivery slot the door_bell went and it was an other parcel i had ordered .
0	i did not even know dpd did that as i have never had anything delivered by them .
0	i am only complaining_about lack of information / lack of tracking_details .
0	well at the moment that is all i am commenting about , delivery is still for today , but is it going to show up ??
0	?
0	well they are not the quickest in processing orders .
0	but they are more than quick enough to take payments in full long before dealing_with your order .
0	made an other order last thursday money was removed from account 0 hour later then my account on ebuyer updated to items wont be sent until 00th for delivery on 00th .
0	a week to process an order ...
0	made an order for £_00 . 00 with an other company and selected free delivery , got email_telling_me delivery is 0 - 00 days ... then got an email 00_mins later telling_me parcel has_been collected by parcel_force to track item click this link after 00pm .
0	checked tracking after 00pm to find my item was on its way and for delivery next working day ...
0	ebuyer should take notes on speeding things up a bit .
0	quick service .
0	quick payment .
0	will use again 000 %!!
0	!
0	i still have not recieved my star pack after a week and no reply to any of my emails
0	are you looking for an efficient , trustworthy and solid purchase ?
0	unparallable customer service and great prices with a huge updated game collection ?
0	well , then you really don_'_t need to look for any alternatives , as cjs - cdkeys are topping the lists on every_single layer .
0	i '_ve had nothing but the greatest of experiences with this site , and will for sure continue to take_advantage of such a fantastic online key store !
0	i can recommend this site with an honest and clear mind , so please have a visit and i '_ll promise you that you won_'_t be dissapointed !

0	fast delivery .
0	the ipod_touch wasn_'_t in great condition , mainly_because the charging dock was damaged , so the cable wouldn_'_t plug in .
0	phoned the customer service , the person was very helpful .
0	he told me i would either go to apple_store myself or send it back to them .
0	i went to apple_store and switched to a brand_new ipod_touch .
0	i was very pleased .
0	apple staff told me there is about 000 days warrenty left , which is not a year as advertised .
0	overall , i was happy with my purchase .
0	however , as the product was rated as a +, i would expect it to be in a full working condition .

0	i took photos of the damage and sent them to groupon asking for a refund .
0	instead of refunding , they sent me a ‘ pre_- paid label ’ early may .

0	i got a phone_call at 0 : 00 saying my goods will be 00_minutes and lo and behold , they were .
0	very friendly drivers too .
0	everyone is so quick to write complaints about bad deliveries on here it ’_s absolutely_shocking , it seems like a different company is being described from what i have read on here !
0	it ’_s logistics , one of the hardest industries to keep everything satisfactory .
0	as soon as it ’_s bad , complaints get written but when it ’_s good , there is silence ?!
0	very well_organised 0 / 0 .
0	when i was looking for job i was shuffling loads of website .
0	since i found adzuna i save time and i discover connections between friends and job opportunity .

0	to put it quite_simply .
0	they lie through there teeth .
0	i have now been waiting in for my delivery for four days .
0	each day i have called after waiting in and been promised that i would ' certainly receive the phone tomorrow '- complete lies .
0	also if you wish to make an enquiry you will have the privilege of having to wait in a queue on a premium_rate line .
0	without a doubt the worst company i have ever_encountered !
0	do not use , do not use !
0	i am now waiting to chat to customer service again and have been waiting in the queue for over half an_hour .
0	i now prey they go_bankrupt
0	made my second order through this company and for the second time they are not " able to despatch this order in full " even_though their website said ' in stock '.
0	very annoying as one of the items was a birthday_present that is now going to be late !
0	my previous order took them a month to restock , even_though i paid £ 0 for two business day delivery .
0	the product was fine but was very disappointed with the service quality here
0	i had never used cjs_cd_keys before now and i am a very skeptical pessimistic person .
0	however on this occasion i decided to try it , and i have to say i could not be more pleased .
0	the price was excellent and the delivery was instant .
0	after a quick security verification by phone i had my key in seconds .

0	i was told all items were in stock , and the conformation e_- mail to say my delivery was due on the 0st nov . well , 0 empty tubs turned_up , 0 out of 0 items i ordered , so i waited another day , maybe there had been a mess up .
0	end of the 0nd of nov , i ring customer_care , theres still no parcels or any information on whats_happening .
0	they didnt seem to care , but i was told there had been a system error and that my parcel would be here monday0th / tuesday0th .
0	so i waited , and waited , rang up , and i might_add spend 00_minutes on hold to a business number , only to be told the items i ordered are now not in stock , and they didnt know when they would be .
0	alas , on thursday0th , i receive an email_telling_me 0 items are due for delivery the next_day .. well , here i am , still_waiting .
0	only god_knows when ill get the others .
0	and by looking at the other issues people have had recently , im not alone .
0	but to make it worse , this isnt the first time things like this have happened .
0	it gets better , they have taken payment in full !
0	shame i cant give them my money in installments based on their service !
0	so by all means , myprotein products are great .. but order your stuff a month in advance , or roll the dice with their stock / delivery promises

0	they called me after i placed my order to say that some of the laptops they send out are faulty , and without paying a £_00 inspection charge , they would refuse to cover any faults such as pixel loss , which is not deemed as a fault ... on a brand_new laptop ?!?!?
0	!
0	sales and customer_services staff sound like they are being forced to take your call at gunpoint and go out of their way to be combative and rude , and try to make you sound like you ' re stupid ( hey , i '_m not the one working in a call_centre trying to upsell for a scam merchant ).
0	i have now had three follow on calls , even after i cancelled my order trying to upsell some rubbish internet security package without which apparently i will be in grave danger , and it is way better_than norton and mcaffee which they have had a lot of complaints about , apparently .

0	i have been using aria for a while now and each time i do , i remember why .
0	i very rarely have to check elsewhere as nine times out of ten they will win on price but they still don_'_t skimp on customer service .
0	the staff are always friendly and knowledgeable .
0	i '_ve not had a single problem with delivery , especially since they switched to dpd .
0	i '_ve ordered quite late in the day and still ended_up receiving my order the next_day .
0	as well as the customer service , the community forum is pleasant to partake in and the competitions and rewards for loyal participants just top off what is already an excellent online shopping_experience .
0	if i had one criticism , it would be that email support is sometimes a little on the slow side , but pick_up the phone and you will always get a response .
0	i never have any hesitation to suggest them to friends and family .
0	this is the best parts site i have used and best of all its free which is a refreshing_change from being_ripped_off on other_sites .
0	within a few hours i had quotes from a number of parts suppliers and as my part was a bit_awkward to find i was really impressed with the service and the prices .
0	highly_recommend using these_guys
0	after waiting a while for a cheque that didnt arrive due to being ' lost ' in the post and resolving this with a very helpful person , ive decided to change my review as they did as much as they could to resolve the issue . they have given the best price for my phone out of all the companies available . from sending my phone in uptil the payment process i was informed everyway possible .
0	as my phone was a high value one i was recomended to send special delivery which i would have just posted recorded so have to thank them for that too .
0	i use creatine from these_guys which is of high_quality , a great price and very quick delivery .
0	use cyclone exclusively and don_'_t buy it from anywhere_else .
0	big range of specialized products , no tat to be found .
0	my order came through the post so quick it made my head spin !
0	nightgear cover all bases , and are cheaper_than anywhere_else that i can find online .
0	the range of kit that is available is immense , and there are stacks of different brands .
0	everything from nvg '_s to boot polishing kits .
0	the quality of the products and the service from the customer_care team is far beyond what you would expect for such online value .
0	i would highly_recommend nightgear as the first stop when looking for tactical kit .
0	great experiences with them !
0	i have never been disappointed by the company .
0	helpful , great staff .
0	thanks !
0	the company doesn_'_t respect the warranty_period , doesn_'_t answer complaints , lies ...
0	ordered at 0pm and recieved it two_days_later , earlier_than stated which is great .

0	would recommned to anyone :)
0	i looked all over the internet for the very best prices .
0	when it came to one product i was looking anywhere from 00 . 00 - 00 . 00 .
0	i came_across supplementwarehouse and their listen price was 00 . 00 .
0	however !!!!
0	the will match the lowest_price you find and beat it !
0	simply amazing .
0	not to mention ill be receiving a free workout cup .
0	supplementwarehouse is the only way to go !
0	!
0	needed to buy replacement_keys for cupboards and lockers - arrived quickly , keys worked and no_fuss .
0	good communication_throughout , well priced , reccomended .
0	having been severely let_down by yodel , amazon sent out a replacement product via the dpd express service .
0	i received an email_informing_me of an_hour_window ( it arrived bang in the middle ) and was in good order .
0	nice to know there are some delivery companies out there who do their job !
0	the parcel was out for delivery on the 0th .
0	( i purchased my item a long time ago ) the estimated delivery date was the 0th so i waited in all day , no parcel .
0	i phoned the next_morning and was told that it would deffinately be with me that day and if there were any_issues the driver would call me ...... all day went by and no parcel .
0	i phoned again in the evening and they actually gave_me the drivers number and when i spoke to her i was told after a large huff that she had just been in my area and that she had finished work for the day !!
0	she promised to be here just after 0000 this morning and you guessed it ...... still_waiting .
0	its not like i have a life !!

0	the best prices by far for lens hire in the uk - all the lenses you could ever need from a fisheye to 000mm - and above all a fantastic service and very helpful staff at the end of the phone doing everything they can to help ....
0	very highly_recommended , i will never rent from another company again .
0	i wish people would stop rating this complete scam of a company with 0 or 0_stars .
0	the fact is yes they are very good / nice / efficient at taking your money and it is cheaper_than other insurance providers , however do not rate until you have actually made a successful claim .
0	it seems to be impossible to do so .
0	its all good and well saying " great i get my insurance £ 0 cheaper_than the other_places " however as far as i am concerned i may as well have thrown that money away because im never going to get my phone back .
0	also when i add up all the excesses charges and phone bills i have used to try and get hold of protectyourbubble then the cost almost outweighs the near £_000 phone that was " insured "
0	they never phone you back , never reply to emails , you end up on hold for hours .
0	please_please people mark my words and pay the extra few_pounds for a proper insurance_cover as you will be throwing your money away like i did .
0	its either giving away £ 0 a month or paying £ 0 - 0 to get some actual insurance .
0	in 0000 we made the decision to go into the online market and for us this was very daunting as we had very little experience or knowledge of how it all works .
0	after doing a bit of research and talking to people in our trade who had already expanded into the online side of business , one name kept being mentioned as a professional and reliable company for creating our website .
0	that company was visualsoft .
0	from our very 0st talk with them we felt at ease that we had chosen the right people for the job .
0	any questions we had be it serious or silly they were there to answer and every process was explained to us in full detail .
0	we now have a great looking website that is easy to use for both the customer and ourselves .
0	if we have any problem be it big or small our account_manager hester is always just a phone_call away and always ready to help .
0	their aftercare and support are second to none .
0	truly a professional and supportive company that we have and will_continue to recommend to others .
0	0 *
0	another top quality service from p0g - i use these_guys on a regular_basis for sending_parcels abroad and have had nothing but top quality service .
0	even when the website acts a little screwy the instant_chat / help function is there to help .
0	- a big thanks to catherine who helped_me book a parcel to ireland when the website wouldn_'_t ;¬)
0	i would highly_recommend steve and logodepot - i am really pleased with the designs that i got , as well as the stationary designs .
0	i didn_'_t give them a huge_amount of information to start with , but they still managed to come up with some fantastic initial designs , and any changes requested were sent back very quickly ( within a few hours max ).
0	the business card printers that i am using commented on the quality and originality of their design - saying they were some of they best they had seen !
0	the price was extremely competitive , and i am now going to be exploring my website design with them .
0	thanks !
0	until recently play . com was always the fallback website .
0	there if i couldn_'_t find my product anywhere_else .
0	but recently i '_ve been finding myself using it more and more .
0	myself ( and my wife ) now use this site as one of the first calls when a birthday comes along .
0	you can '_t go_wrong for friends and family with a dvd , game , music or one of the other great products play . com offer .
0	fast delivery and varied_selection are what keep this site on the top list ( though their prices can someones not be very competative ).
0	until this week i had never_heard of clickforgames .
0	i thought i ' d give them a try as they were offering the product i wanted cheaper_than anywhere_else on the net .
0	i was shocked when , the next_day , the product was waiting for me when i got home .
0	the game is in mint_condition ( the wrapping isn_'_t even damaged !
0	).
0	as a keen gamer i buy a lot of games and i am pleased to say that not only will i be using them again , but i will be recommending them to everyone .
0	i love using supplement_warehouse !
0	you can '_t find another site with cheaper prices or faster shipping .
0	they have everything you need to supplement propertly and help you obtain your goals .
0	i won_'_t use any other site to order products from .
0	hey , i was totally unsure on which direction to take getting in to computer recording but these_guys helped_me greatly with what software would be best and what instruments to add for somebody like me getting in to producing electronic based music .
0	i '_ve since been back to them and ordered some monitors and had the same great service again .
0	couldn_'_t be_happier .
0	; )
0	they ' re always really happy and nice .
0	compelled to review bananafingers . co . uk having used them 0 times now and have to say i '_m thoroughly impressed .
0	having used other_websites to purchase climbing_gear previously i have found bf to be competitive on price and the guys in the shop offer friendly and helpful advice when i '_ve needed it .
0	highly_recommended .
0	non_existent customer service , i emailed them about a query on my order , that was around the 00th_july , can '_t remember the exact date it was that long ago , today is the 00nd_august and still no reply , don_'_t even try phoning unless you have nothing better to do all day as a long wait is in order .
0	all i wanted was an explanation to a mistake , seems that once you get the curtains its goodbye .
0	would not use again and would definately not recommend to any of my friends , they may be cheap , but cheap is what you get in after sales .
0	in the end rather_than wait for eternity for a response i took the curtains to a seamstress to have them altered , didn_'_t make them so cheap after all by the time i paid for the extra work .
0	update_:
0	received a phone_call from woodyatt apologizing for the non reply , they say that they have no record of my query which was sent through their own ' contact us ' tab on their website , what a surprise , also was never asked which number i rang from so don_'_t know how they checked a call log without the number i rang from .
0	funny how it took a review on trustpilot to trigger a response from them , they got that email ok !
0	they have even admitted their website needs improved to make it easier for customers but yet i am still out of pocket to the value of £_00 with no offer of compensation .
0	careful when trying to use the code they send you for registering for their newsletter , after i purchased a song i seen the deal showing 00_% of your first mp0 purchase and applied 00_mins after my purchase .
0	when i then tried to apply the code it said error , already used , i then complained to their customer service team and was told that it was applied to the song at 00p not the album i was going to buy at £ 0 . 00 . the fact that they hadn_'_t even sent me the code before i tried to purchase didn_'_t even click with them .
0	going back to itunes .
0	terrible company , totally_useless !
0	achica sent me an email with a code to use for my first purchase , a £_00 voucher .
0	when i tried to use the voucher it said invalid , i emailed them and got a response one day later telling_me to try another code , which i tried and surprise_surprise it also said invalid . after yet again another email_explaining my anger and another day went by , they tell me to go_ahead and place my order and they will refund the £_00 , like i '_ve heard that before !
0	they now have given me another code to use but now the items i first wanted have ended .
0	what a complete_waste of time , i wish i had read the reviews about the company first of all and would never have went near them .
0	my advice , pay a bit more and buy from a well established , reputable_company .
0	one of the worst companies i have ever_dealt_with , their so called customer service is more like i couldn_'_t care less attitude .
0	after ordering one of their products they somehow messed_up the delivery address , don_'_t ask me how as the online form was filled in correctly but they say that they used my email address as a postal_address , i mean how daft can you get .
0	after several emails back and forward i am still none the wiser , they say that the delivery company will contact me but still nothing , i have asked them to confirm what details they have given the delivery company to make_sure they have the correct phone number but still nothing .
0	if they can '_t get a simple request like this correct it does not say much for the company .
0	also while all this is going on , not one word of apology from them , hopeless !
0	!
0	a complete_disaster from_start to finish , first ordered two bean_bags through groupon , had to wait months to finally receive them , was given a £_00 coupon as a way of compensation which i thought i would give them one more chance to impress so ordered a light , should have learnt my lesson !
0	every time i get an expected date for delivery it passes by and now going by the recent date it will be one year to receive the light , if it ever arrives !
0	i have requested a refund twice , still_waiting now nearly two months , so like their products will probably wait about a year to receive .
0	take my advice , avoid like the plague , you may pay more from another company but at_least you will get your order and avoid all the hassle .
0	update 00 / 00 / 00
0	after my post on trustpilot i received a phone_call from emilie who_apologised for the inconvenience and said that she would apply for my refund and process as quickly as possible but it could take up to 00 working_days , so my first thought was , i won_'_t hold my breath , we will wait and see and planned to count the days down .
0	i received another phone_call today ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) from emilie to update me and said that the full_refund had been put back on my credit_card , so i checked ..................... and yes , a full_refund was back on my credit_card .
0	so thank_you emilie , you have restored some faith back in infurn !
0	the product was very competitively_priced with free delivery .
0	product arrived with no_fuss , within a day of ordering and was very well_wrapped .
0	lots of mechanisms to communicate with webtogs and whilst i didn_'_t need to as the ordering_process was very smooth i had the confidence that customer service is a priority .
0	i will_definitely be buying more from them !
0	0 year_ago this month i started my diet to lose_weight , with the help of ds staff , their knowledge of products that i should be taking like proteins , vitamins and recovery supplements and the motivation i received from them along with some of the sponsors they had come into the store like optimum nutritions aaron smith i have gone from 00 stone ( 000pounds ) to just under 00 stone ( 000pounds ).
0	i am a happier , healthier and more motivated person and want to thanks ds and their sponsors for their help , knowledge and motivation .
0	they even helped_me out with workout advice and diets .
0	top lads altogether !
0	i included a picture of me before i started my diet and one from the other day .
0	im not great with photo_editing so feel free to laugh !
0	ha !
0	thanks for helping_me change my life !
0	this is innovation at its finest using a webcam make u feel more in the game and seeing some of the live wins is hilariously fun and the chat_hosts are great friendly and a bit crazy which makes it a pleasure to play and users are friendly and helpful
0	i received great advice and was put at ease by clive while purchasing my wedding_ring online from diamondgeezer . com .
0	i would_gladly reccomend anyone_else who is in the market for a great ring at a reasonable price .
0	quick delivery and exactly as_described .
0	no_problems ordering .

0	?
0	posted a job but them removed as job was filled elsewhere , but they refuse to refund my deposit !
0	cheapest site online , delivered on time and great communication when i asked to change delivery date !
0	top_notch !
0	tackle_uk sent me an item that had been taken out of its packaging and there was a piece missing so i could not use the item they sent me .
0	they tehn want me to waste my own personal time and petrol money to go into to town to return the item before i can have a refund .
0	this is not the way how things should be done , you sent me faulty goods so it should be up to tackle_uk to get the item picked_up , not me to send it back to you .
0	its wrong and wont be dealing_with them anymore
0	i have ordered here a few_times and almost always price match .
0	it is a good place to do_business .
0	i like the free_samples to see if i would be interested in purchasing new supplements .
0	i order from this site every_month after being let_down by other supplement sites previously .
0	it has every supplement i '_ve ever needed and at some of the lowest_prices i can find .
0	you ' re rewarded for your loyalty with discounts up to 0 % for repeat buyers which is cool and free_samples !
0	delivery is second to none .
0	their cheap saturday delivery has also been a life_saver for me many_times and has not let_me down yet .
0	i recommend this site to everone !
0	i dont_think i could of asked for much more .
0	they ' re good value and fast .
0	very fast considering it comes from_hong_kong .
0	they also supplied me with a uk_plug adaptor and paid my import_tax .
0	there was no need to contact customer service so i cant_comment on that .
0	i will_definitely be using them again .
0	our bar guide was fantastic she even bought her friend along !!!
0	( both hot ) she kept in contact all weekend as we arranged additional activities upon_arrival .
0	our guide even accompanied us on the second night for drinks .
0	the boat hotel was the best stag accommodation ive_ever stayed in , it was clean and tidy i would use it again .
0	overall well impressed with pissup . com
0	ordered 0 items in past year , 0 have been cancelled by hmv after anything from a day to 0_weeks for various_reasons .
0	( maybe i '_m unlucky )
0	i still order from them , i '_m just not too surprised if they cancel the order .
0	if they truly have the item in stock , you '_ll usually get a " it '_s on its way " email the next_day or so and everything is nice and fast .
0	the letting you know the item is in the post is a good touch .
0	if you find a really good bargain , just don_'_t be too surprised to get a cancel order email a few_days_later .
0	the money is refund quick enough so you can buy elsewhere if needed .
0	finding urbanindustry on a blog i often go on ( thedailystreet . co . uk ), i decided to order my christmas clobber from them and i couldn_'_t be more happier even if santa himself had delivered it .
0	was fast , delivery and packaging of goods perfect , great communication , will_definitely be using again in the future !
0	having used shopto before on multiple_occasions there service never_ceases to amaze .
0	they have by far the best shipping and fastest delivery of any website ive tried and shopto is always my number one choice when im looking to purchase .
0	i had two orders already with musclefood and i am extremely happy with the meat i received .
0	i have recommended them to all my friends and already placed third order .
0	thank_you musclefood !!
0	!
0	my order was process very fast , the barbecue arrived in less_than 00h .
0	product is fantastic and was eay to set_up .
0	would recomend it to all my friends .
0	thanks
0	very satisfied with all products you are selling , genuine products , fast delivery , very competetive_prices and good discount .
0	tacky tat that is overpriced .
0	they hide_behind the fact that they sell online so their photoshopped images hide the shoddy condition of the junk they peddle , and when you try and return it , get ready for the circus .
0	massively disgraceful .
0	avoid
0	after being let_down by idiots claiming how amazing they are and being left needing something to sit on , i came_across this concept of design and build your own sofa .
0	delivered within a couple of days , excellent communication , faultless courier ( pink ), took about 0hr and a half to put_together .
0	very comfortable and very happy with it .
0	especially the price .
0	recommended .
0	ordered a sofa last friday after they claim next_day delivery .
0	stay in all tuesday , the booked and agreed delivery date .
0	no contact to say its not coming .
0	i phone them at 0 . 00pm and they say its not coming .
0	they couldn_'_t be_bothered to get in touch .
0	very poor service .
0	first and last ever order from a third rate outfit .
0	conversation went :
0	me : " so why has nobody bothered to let_me know its not coming today ?"
0	them : " i '_m can only say i '_m sorry "
0	me : " so when is it being delivered ?"
0	them : " just keep checking the tracking_information every day …"
0	me : " just a minute … every day ?
0	you mean you '_ve no idea when it '_s coming at all even_though your website states in stock and available for next_day delivery , and you claim to provide amazing next_day service .
0	are you expecting me to take the next few weeks off work hoping that it might finally arrive one day ?"
0	them : " no the courier will phone or text you "
0	me : " well clearly they haven_'_t bothered to today when it was supposed to arrive .
0	can you give me the telephone_number for xdp as there is none on their website ?"
0	them : " no we don_'_t have one ."
0	me : " just cancel the order then ."
0	they seem to fail to understand that self - employed people cannot_afford to stay at home all day for something not to arrive as they are not able to be out earning .
0	these are a bunch of clowns with no idea about prompt reliable customer service or how to perform internet / mail order retail successfully .
0	avoid and save your time and sanity .
0	loving all the fake 0 * reviews by people who only have ever written this one amazing review .
0	pathetic
0	back in november ordered a sofa from these_clowns .
0	website states delivery 0 - 0_weeks , in - stock , direct from manufacturer .
0	telephoned them the day before delivery to confirm all was well and would go_ahead as we were going to get_rid of old sofa .
0	apparently manufacturer would call us with eta .
0	delivery day comes and no sofa .
0	telephoned studio who say they cannot give us the telephone_number for the manufacturer because they don_'_t know who the manufacturer is , but the manufacturer will telephone us as soon as its ready to deliver .
0	yes you read that correctly - we will be phoned by the manufacturer but they don_'_t know who the manufacturer is !!!
0	so who have you passed our details to ?
0	they don_'_t know .
0	there you have it in a nutshell - studio dont_know who they buy from so they have you waiting in for a delivery but they dont_know who it is delivering it or when its going to come .
0	so now we have nothing to sit on thanks to complete incompetence from a shocking cowboy_outfit .
0	don_'_t even waste your time peeps , you '_ll regret it !
0	i should have read the other reviews on here because clearly studio is not the place to buy a sofa - they seem unable to deliver (_pardon the pun ).
0	perhaps they should concentrate on selling cards because home furnishings is not an area they are capable of dealing in .
0	i have now cancelled the order rather_than have any more poor service , lack of information , and general incompetence .
0	update_: i haven_'_t responded to your reply because as stated i '_ve cancelled the order because you are incompetent .
0	pretending to care by posting a reply after the horse had bolted is clearly pointless and highlighted by many other reviews .
0	these_idiots are the nasty people that get hold of your mobile number illegally and text you at all hours of the night and day pestering you about ppi , but dont reply because firstly it will cost you each time you do , and once you reply ( even stop to try and stop it ), they then know that your number works and they will_continue to bombard you and sell on your number to other rogue illegal outfits
0	from the website it tells you that this guy has_been in business for years on the high_street , and has now started selling online .
0	you can see from the way the online ordering goes , the email confirmation of processing and dispatch that this guy has survived on the high_street by being professional , and has now embraced the internet to keep going and move with the times .
0	and good luck to him , prices are excellent , delivery charges are cheaper_than going into_town , choice and selection is brilliant .
0	ordered yesterday , should have them tomorrow .
0	these are operating a fantastic money making scheme -- for them .
0	the way they calculate interest is unlike any other reputable credit_card , and will leave you paying a fortune .
0	their apr is high , the interest is calulated to leave you paying more interest than your payments unless you pay in full as soon as the bill comes .
0	this is not the card for anyone who doesn_'_t clear in full , and let '_s face it - they advertise and aim at those that don_'_t .
0	on their website it states i have a direct_debit set_up .
0	when i asked for the bank details of this direct_debit they said you don_'_t have one set_up .
0	so if i hadn_'_t queried this and thought , oh they '_ll take the payment and obviously that wouldn_'_t actually happen , i ' d get charged for failing to pay - and they ' d blame me for thinking their website was accurate with them being a financial institution .
0	furthermore , if you try and make a debit_card payment online it rejects every time , ring up and use the same card over the phone and it works .
0	however , if you have tried twice to make payment online and it fails because of their system problems , they refuse to take payment over the phone that day and insist you have to call back another day !
0	as they charge interest daily , by them refusing to take your payment because of their system problems , you '_ll pay more interest as items are charged from the date they appear on your account , so if it takes you longer to get your money onto the account they are raking up even more interest and its not your fault their systems fail .
0	as it clearly_states on your statement : " interest is charged on a daily_basis so interest payments will increase the longer you take to pay , even before the monthly payment date ".
0	what an underhand devious money making scam !
0	very amateur website that doesn_'_t work and gives misleading information that only serves to make them more in charges and interest by cheating the customers .
0	if you ' d avoid the likes of payday_lenders like the plague , you '_ll be well advised to avoid these fagans .
0	when you ask for a quote you '_ll get offers by text and what looks_like a mobile number to ring .
0	they don_'_t warn you in the text that the call is not part of your free mobile minutes but actually a premium_rate mobile number that will cost you a fortune while you ' re sat on hold or going through the menus .
0	there is absolutely no warning on the text about the charges of ringing this number which begins " 00000 " and looks_like an ordinary mobile .
0	if you go on [_external_reference_] com you are given genuine mobile numbers so its easy to think this is the same .
0	it '_s not !
0	don_'_t get_stung by the website claiming " receive no - obligation trade quotes on cheap car parts within minutes via_email , text or telephone absolutely free " because as soon as you reply their premium phone line cash registers are ringing up the profits !
0	if you look them up on companies house , you '_ll see that they change registered address several_times from warwickshire to essex to london , the directors and secretaries are appointed then resign the next_day .
0	make of it what you will but to me i can '_t really give them the benefit of the doubt that there isn_'_t something sinister here .
0	you '_ll be seeing them on watchdog soon !
0	had a telemarketing cold call from 00000000000 .
0	no idea who it was , did a quick google and discovered it was these_people .
0	i '_m on the tps register to stop marketing calls and also ex - directory !
0	further searches revealed this is the same company as yourcalls . net - a shoddy set of scammers also run by the industry named " scumbag " owen bloodworth .
0	do yourself a favour and keep away - they '_ve changed their name but you know what they say about leopards !
0	just had some goods sent to me by this company , smashed beyond use , clearly intentional .
0	couriers like this company deserve to go_bust .
0	sadly they continue to operate as management clearly don_'_t care about the massive negative attitude of their staff , the loathing they have of customers , the immense negative image this company has .
0	i now ask online_retailers which company they use .
0	if its herpes , i ask them to use another courier and if they won_'_t then i tell them i will buy elsewhere because of the courier they have chosen .
0	if others act the same way either they will lose business and be forced to improve or go under .
0	this review is not about buying from these_people , but from working for them .
0	your day will start at 0am and end around 0pm , yet you will only get paid for 0 . 0 hours .
0	the drivers lose about £_000 a month in unpaid work .
0	there is no recognised union and so if you complain you will be summarily dismissed .
0	simply - there is too much to do within the timeframe allowed .
0	the area covered is around 000_miles .
0	on a motorway that would take a car about an_hour and a half .
0	you ' re already now down to six hours paid working time if you could manage that speed !
0	subtract a further two hours at the depot for sorting and scanning the stock , loading the van , printing out the paperwork and completing van checks and daily / weekly / monthly company sheets and you '_ve only four actual hours to deliver or collect at around 00 locations , thats if you can average driving speeds of 00mph of course ( which you can '_t because of the vehicle limiter @ 00mph ).
0	the products are " desktop delivery " which means boxes of paper etc have to be taken to the floor level and actual desk / cupboard where the customer wants the product .
0	which is ok but it takes considerably more time , this isn_'_t just go to the front_desk , " sign here " " there '_s your stuff " and gone in less_than a minute .
0	especially when only a wonky - wheeled sack cart is provided so sometimes one person collecting over 00 boxes from an above ground level could be at a single drop for well over an_hour .
0	factor in the 00mph vehicle limiter , the one way systems and ' pedestrian ' and / or ' no loading after 00am ' zones in city centres , or single drops that are nowhere_near any other drop that take another hour just for one packet ( that cannot possibly be cost_effective and would be cheaper to post ) and with an average of 00 drops per day it soon becomes a mammoth task to complete all drops within an effective 0 hours paid delivery window .
0	the final pettiness of this company though has to be when you take the van to the fuel station .
0	you are given two cards , a bp card to pay for the fuel and a nectar card - yes they get the points and you have to record the number of nectar_points on your manifest .
0	they don_'_t even let you have any little perks !
0	so , in an ethical and moral climate , do you really want to do_business with people who exploit the front line workers ?
0	was about to order a mac_mini from here .
0	now i won_'_t because they clearly an non - uk_based and absolutely awful to deal with .
0	also i note the positive_reviews are by reviewers with only 0 review to their name .
0	always makes me think their own staff write those reviews !
0	just paid an extra £_00 and bought it from [_external link_removed ].
0	it '_s worth_paying a bit more sometimes to go with tried and trusted and have peace of mind rather_than use some scammers .
0	have been with them about 0 months or so , for broadband and line rental , as they were offering a competitive deal .
0	thats the positives dealt_with .
0	the negatives - poor line speeds , regular disconnection , downloads so slow it takes over 0 minutes to load a web_page ( ironically their website support pages at the time !
0	), low monthly restriction ( allowance they call it - which is both upload and download added together ) which soon gets used up having to press refresh on your browser all the time .
0	feels_like i spend more time trying to get it working than using it .
0	found their support useless too , just standard responses and they hide their contact email address so you have to go round in circles through the faq_section which is never relevant to the problem that '_s happening , which meanwhile uses up more of your monthly restriction , oops allowance .
0	it '_s crap , but it '_s cheap .
0	so you pays your money ....
0	if you want good reliable broadband , pay a bit more and go_elsewhere .
0	if you hardly use the internet and just want it for loading very basic webpages with no flash / media content on it then maybe its the one for you .
0	for me , frustratingly slow , poor service so ultimately poor value .
0	after telling them that their broadband is throttled so much and ridiculously slow , and taking up to 0 minutes just to load their own website pages , their answer is that i have to go out and buy another router from the one they supplied or pay for an engineer to visit .
0	this is their award_winning service ?
0	what award is this then ?
0	" biggest cowboy_outfit isp award "?
0	time to refer them to the regulator as every other poor reviewer on here seems to have to do ...
0	have used these for years , the service is absolutely spot on .
0	very good choice for cigar and pipe tobacco , and very keen_prices .
0	delivery charges are very reasonable too compared to other_sites .
0	usually get orders next_day , though its down to postal service if first_class gets to you next_day or day after .
0	found them to be far cheaper_than the likes of comet , currys , john_lewis .
0	goods arrived within the 00 minute promised time_slot .
0	item was damaged , offered 00_%_discount to keep it or replacement could be sent the following_day .
0	delivery guys were friendly and helpful , they called in on their phone to report damaged item .
0	unwrapped it and took away all packaging without_fuss .
0	shame about dent , but these things_happen and they did make a generous offer or prompt replacement so that plus the excellent prices means it has to be 0_stars !
0	bosch " blue " power_tools are for the trade .
0	similar in design to some of the green diy tools , but inside are better components for daily use rather_than occasional .
0	hard_wearing .
0	its good gear right enough , but when things do break down they really excel .
0	the blue stuff has a year_guarantee that if you register your product within 0_weeks of purchase , they upgrade free to 0 years .
0	if anything fails , they send a courier out to wherever you ' re working , collect the faulty item and repair / replace and return it to you within a few_days .
0	all under_warranty .
0	now that is service !
0	haven_'_t had any trouble with transtools over several orders .
0	stuff takes a few_days to arrive , not a next_day outfit so if you do want it quick maybe look_elsewhere .
0	but the prices and range i think are good .
0	latest order was sent in two parcels , one parcel went_astray but that was citylink '_s fault and arrived the next_day [ website showed 0 parcels but they only delivered 0 ].
0	when i emailed transtools , they responded quickly .
0	you only know how good a company is when things go_wrong .
0	haven_'_t had cause to fault transtools yet so until then i '_m happy to keep using them .
0	no_quibbles website which is easy to use .
0	wheels have been throughly tested and run like a dream !
0	thank_you
0	easy to use check out .
0	cant_wait for the items to arrive !

0	trustpilot is playing very unfair .
0	it has banned reviews from a company i work for - canvasdezign .
0	it has left 0 reviews online that are both fake .
0	they are making it very difficult for us to increase or even decrease our profile .
0	either start allowing reviews or remove the fake_reviews that are visible .
0	it is totally unfair .
0	easiest and safest purchase i have made on line .
0	the prices are at_least 00_%_cheaper_than direct or anywhere_else and they are absolutely awesome !
0	will be using many_times in the future !
0	what can i say , easy to use site & great price - what more do you need ?
0	we ' d been looking for ' something ' for a month or so , no idea where to go or where to stay , found a great deal on flights to tenerife from manchester - the price you see is what you pay unlike a few other_sites we ' d been using .
0	clicked through to see a few_hundred available hotels in costa adeje , filtered away to get to the good stuff , 0 * all inclusive , good reviews , good price , clickity click and booked !
0	added insurance and airport_transfers for next to nothing .
0	ive read a few stories_about online companies being quick to take your money and then later on you find out the hotel doesnt exist , cant get in touch with them , extra fees at the hotel / airport etc but ive travelled and am now safely back in the uk .
0	no extra fee '_s , phoned to pay my balance and enquire_about transfer time , was on hold for no more than 0 minutes and had my fairly trivial query resolved .
0	flight went on time no_problems there , taxi waiting at tfs took us straight to the hotel where we spent 0_weeks eating and drinking as much as we liked .
0	i cant_fault the service , price or weather so a big 0 / 0 from me !
0	the service provided from function00 was absolutely fantastic .
0	the staff were extremely_helpful and talked_me through each_step of every process .
0	shipping service was great , so quick !
0	i have already_recommended function00 to all of the golfers in my club .
0	great service , great gear , great site !!
0	!
0	shopto are really good .
0	i '_ve been genuinely impressed ( enough to write a feedback review , which i never do ) by their service .
0	the prices are usually around as cheap as anywhere_else might go , and i don_'_t think i '_ve had one order that arrived later than_expected ( thanks , play . com !).
0	being_able to order before 0pm and get the game the next_morning ( at no extra_charge ) is such a luxury , it '_s spoiled me when ordering from other_places .
0	i know it '_s hyperbolic , but i can only recommend them highly .
0	i ordered some flowers at around 0pm for my mum '_s birthday the next_day and they arrived bang on time and looked fantastic .
0	the website was really easy to use and understand and the prices were very reasonable .
0	i could easily upgrade my order to ' deluxe ' for little extra_cost .
0	i was updated via_email and text at every_stage of the process , thanking and confirming my order , telling_me when the flowers were out for delivery and when they ' d been delivered .
0	the brand voice and experience was great from_start to finish , very easy to use and i ' d definitely use them again .
0	very happy :-)
0	i had a great experience ordering from truffleshuffle .
0	i was given updates on where my order was up to and when to expect it to be delivered .
0	the cost of delivery was considerably_cheaper_than a lot of other_companies , especially_considering how quickly the order arrived ( i ordered on monday_evening and received the order early wednesday_morning ).
0	the products themselves are fantastic and the fact that truffleshuffle threw a sweet in there as well just made my day !
0	i will_definitely be using truffleshuffle again and would wholeheartedly_recommend them to anyone .
0	with myprotein receiving such praise from other people who have ordered from it , i set my hopes quite high for the product .
0	however , i was completely let_down .
0	the protein will not mix properly with water , instead the water turns a horrible yellow colour that looks and tastes disgusting .
0	the protein is completely unusable .
0	great prices
0	great variety of brands
0	tons of high_quality shit
0	easy to order ; speedy delivery ; item exactly as expected - 00 / 00 .
0	i don_'_t normally leave_feedback on anything that i order , but felt_compelled to due to the excellent experience of ordering from woodhouse clothing .
0	i was a little_wary of ordering , as it was my first order with the company and the reviews here are mixed .
0	i ordered a pair of onitsuka tiger trainers on saturday_afternoon , and i have just received delivery of them now ( midday on monday ) - very fast .
0	the shoes are exactly as_described , very comfortable , and they were £_00 cheaper_than the next nearest price i found at a more well - known company .
0	i would not_hesitate t order from this company again .
0	i will not be using cash_generator again .
0	i was sent a faulty ps0 which i later sent back .
0	the shop sent a courier which i though was good and i was happy with that .
0	they also told me that they would get a replacement sourced and sent out to me .
0	i emailed them a week_ago and they guaranteed my new ps0 would be here by monday .
0	it is now tuesday and they have stopped answering my emails and i have the feeling that like many other people , i will not be hearing from them again .
0	thank_you cash_generator for your terrible service and causing my brother to go without a birthday_present .
0	super products , fast delivery and very well_packaged .
0	once again i '_ve unlocked my 0rd iphone 0 locked to korea carrier ... im very satiesfied with this services , its real ... now im waiting again for iphone 0 00gb japan carrier unlock services to be available in this services ... i hope i will get discount for my next unlock ... hehehehe
0	i buy my protein from supplement_warehouse every time .
0	i have never had an issue with shipping and it always ships fast .
0	even_though shipping is expensive , they make up for it with their extremely cheap rates on products .
0	great company !
0	until recently my experience with 000reg had been ok and i never had any_problems with the few domains i '_ve registered with them .
0	however , i logged in to update a domain i own with them to redirect to a blog , but the domain had gone .
0	i paid 000reg to renew the domain , but they failed to pay the registry so the domain was lost .
0	a third_party bought it and wants $ 0000 for it !
0	i am not paying $ 0000 for 000reg '_s mistake , and to make it worse their support staff have been completely dismissive & try to avoid taking responsibility at every opportunity .
0	they even have the audacity to tell me they failed to pay the registry , but the loss of the domain is my fault for not checking with a third_party that they did their job !
0	this example shows serious incompetence and a lack of care for customers when they make a mistake .
0	any domain registrar should know how to renew domains without losing them , and in any case of a renewal failing they should at_least detect this so that action can be taken .
0	000reg failed to do their job here and try to escape responsibility so they don_'_t need to pay for their mistake .
0	i could forgive a mistake if they made up for it , but their attitude is unbelievably bad .
0	atrocious customer service & incompetence .
0	i will try to transfer all of my domains away from this terrible company !
0	great service , quick delivery , very good price
0	i have used this company for well over a year now for all my supplements and theyh are always the best price and delivery very quickly .
0	highly_recommended
0	i booked some tickets to see pat metheny at the hammersmith apollo in june .
0	i booked them in march - a month_ago .
0	as well as paying for the tickets i paid over £_00 in booking and postage fees .
0	rather excessive i thought but at_least it should guarantee good service .
0	oh no it didn_'_t .
0	the tickets were confirmed as shipped a day or so after i bought them , but a week_later i hadn_'_t received them .
0	i got in touch with eventim who said that it i waited_until 0 days before the event they ' d arrange for me to collect them on the night .
0	i pointed_out how foolish it would be to cut it so fine given that things obviously had already gone_wrong once .
0	i asked them to send them out by recorded delivery instead .
0	failing that they could make them available for immediate collection at the venue and refund their fees .
0	i got an email back telling_me what their policy was as if that was a genuine reason_why they couldn_'_t carry out a simple recovery operation for lost tickets as and when circumstances necessitated .
0	so i phoned them up .
0	after_speaking to another policy - parroting zombie i was handed to a manager who first attempted to fob me off with the same nonsense about policy and then tried to suggest that it was there to prevent ticket fraud .
0	the best i could get out of her was a promise to contact the venue and ask what they would allow the ticket agents to do .
0	much later in the day i received an email from her saying the same stuff with which she and her colleagues had tried to fob me off .
0	i wrote back very angrily outlining why this was unacceptable .
0	i should not have to wait months worrying_about whether i would gain admittance after paying over £_00 in fees for a service that should alleviate any such worry .
0	i got a reply a week_later from another customer service manager , stuart james , just repeating the same nonsense again .
0	naturally they will not refund the booking or postage fees , and had the cheek to claim that it was because they are making them available for collection at the last_minute , and that collection fees are the same as postage (£. 000 ).
0	i '_ll be royal_mail are glad that they are providing their services for free .
0	it has occurred to me that the choice not to make tickets available for collection until the very last moment may be to enable them to resell the seats to someone_else at a higher price , and then give me a refund so they can make a profit leaving me none the wiser .
0	i got exactly_what i ordered and on time .
0	so_far i am pleased with it .
0	i '_m hopeful the product will survive continual use .
0	if so it '_ll prove exceptional value .
0	if not i '_ll just have to re - evaluate what to use in future .
0	i have been using sw for years and they take care of me every time .
0	out of the few_times that something went wrong they were quick to resolve the problem .
0	they have got to be one of the worst companies to deal with when it comes to changing or ending a contract , even after 0 hours of trying to get them to cancel my contract and being told that i was making " the wrong decision " by leaving them and that leaving them for a rival carrier was " stupid ", they still didn_'_t even do what i asked them to do in the first place which was end my rolling_contract , which resulted_in me having to phone them again , and of course going through the exact_same stuff and tripe that their staff have to come out with .
0	all in all they are a horrible company to deal with , don_'_t be suckered in by their cheap deals as what you may have saved in money , you pay for in time , effort and stress with having to deal with rude and frankly incompetent staff .
0	do yourselves a favor and go with a different carrier , 0 are a shambles of a company .
0	didn_'_t know what to expect at first after being a shopto customer but very happy with the service that simply_games provides .
0	well recommended
0	i '_ve_used it for the second and i have got to say i am not disappointed .
0	the process went_smoothly and the autokey_system is amazing .
0	i got my key in less_than 00_minutes !

0	it is cool , but have no messenger for windows platform .
0	i can not live with out it !
0	i like to buy books on this website .
0	it is cheaper then buy in bookstore !
0	i had been told i would get £_00 for my 0gs .
0	it failed it '_s test due to a key scratch on the back and they had the cheek to reduce it to £_00 !
0	i wanted it returned but this would cost almost £ 0 , they are based in london so i said i would rather collect it myself and they refused .
0	reluctantly i accepted the offer and 0_weeks_later i '_m still_waiting for the money to be put in to my account .
0	they are an_absolute_disgrace , lure you in with a high price and then knock you down .
0	was renting a ford_focus or similar and ended_up with a skoda_octavia !
0	very very powerful beast and was perfect for the drive from dublin_airport to electric picnic .

0	i bought a hairmax laser comb from peak_nutrition who are the only uk stockists with such a low price .
0	very pleased with the speed and quality of the delivery
0	they have a site that makes it easy to find what you are looking for with great info on each product .
0	they also have great prices and also have a matching guarantee .
0	a fast and speedy service , at a good price .
0	they have pretty_much everything you could need .
0	generally its the cheapest you an find as well , but if it isn_'_t then you can put in the link and they will beat that price by 0 %.
0	pretty good deal .
0	its a 0 stop_shop and ive always received my products within a few_days of ordering .
0	i love the supplements , high_quality and quick results !
0	!
0	oh_dear , it seems as if i '_m not the only one suffering with this retailer '_s poor customer service and deliveries .
0	ordered an item on june 0th , which i '_ve still yet to receive .
0	despite contacting the retailer on june_00th , 00th and 00st , i have received a single reply on the 00th to advise they are investigating .
0	however , i '_ve yet to receive a reply since then , and am now out of pocket as there is no item and they have my money .
0	avoid at all costs - despite their previous positive_reviews , it appears in the last few weeks they are not delivering items .
0	do not order from them .
0	fast postage , excellent item .
0	video helped make decision to purchase , and ankle_brace has really helped ongoing rehab back to sport .
0	i sent back a item for a full_refund under dsr more than a month_ago , i still yet to receive a refund which they keep saying they will process yet don_'_t !
0	they never reply to emails , i have to ring them up to contact them .
0	i was threatened on the phone that i will not receive a refund if i keep calling them about it , and i was also called a idiot on the phone !
0	ever_since the hut_group took over this company customer service is terrible , scam_artists !
0	avoid like the plague
0	an all in one solution to getting your tyres replaced at your convenience .

0	delivery nice and early in the day ready for me to go train and no_problems .
0	perfect .
0	it was a good quality costume , got delivered really quickly , good service but it didn_'_t fit
0	i was with aol from the days of compuserve and had always raved_about them ; their reliability , speeds , customer service .... oh how times have changed !
0	!
0	my complaints began about 00months ago with emails i sent not being received and no bounce backs ( this caused a lot of trouble and i lost business as a result ).
0	aol blamed everything from filters to the router to windows , basically anything_else apart_from them .
0	i '_m quite geeky so when i caught them out at each point they finally , after many calls over 0 months offered to upgrade my service and send a new modem - all i ' d have to do was sign up to a new contract .
0	i argued them down in price instead and eventually got the deal i was happy with and ( stupidly ) accepted .
0	of course the problems were never resolved , the indian based staff are clearly dragged off the street , given no training and are just plonked infront of a 00 '_s era pc with a script to read from .
0	they have no clue what to do , are unwilling to escalate and their two main functions are to :
0	a ) get you to sign up for another contract - preferably with line rental .
0	b ) get you off the phone by telling you any lie they can think of , or as a failsafe that you have come through to the wrong department and they can '_t transfer you .
0	my main issues were with email not being received , but this didn_'_t worry them .
0	i was promised call_backs , escalations , uk_based technical_team visits ..... nothing .
0	what really angered me were the constant_lies , when you have been a loyal_customer for 00 years , you expect better treatment that this .
0	i left in march and have not looked back .
0	one of their original lies told to me 00months ago was that if i left them they would also delete my screen name and i ' d lose my aol . com email address - this is a lie .
0	if , like me , this is a reason to stay , rest_assured , they don_'_t .
0	i went to the extreme of changing everything away from my aol email but when my cancellation was complete , my email and screen name have remained active .
0	basically the lesson_learned is that they are a bunch of clueless liars who want your money and no_longer care about the customer .
0	i '_m now with orange as i also have my mobile contract with them and although others may complain_about them , i '_ve found them good .
0	sky are attractive if you stay on their good side , but my advice would be to go with o0 who seem to have the best customer_support and that is what you need if things go_wrong .
0	very happy with there customer service , they sent me the wrong item but as soon as they were contacted they were straight on it , the correct order was sent out and received with no damage .
0	i have now just ordered a subwoffer from them due to the excellent shipping , prices and customer service .
0	i would highly_recommend hifi - tower to anyone .
0	thanks
0	ordered 0 new tyres on monday_afternoon and they were fitted by andy the technician before 0pm the next_day , excellent service .

0	bt have disconnected me after one week of using the internet from bt_infinity :/ and after apart of taking from by direct_debit 0000 gbp as cancelation charges , offered me reconnection after 0 weeeks !!!!

0	i were calling bt trying to get help on their facebook profile but is already 00 days from my disconnection time and things aren_'_t moving inch forward .

0	initially i was skeptical_about these kinds of sites that offer fast cash for your old_mobile , but i was hoping to sell my iphone 0 to make a few extra quid .
0	i read the overwhelmingly_positive_reviews online about mazuma and thought i ' d give them a try .
0	suffice to say i posted my phone ( registered delivery ) at 0 :_00pm on wednesday and the money was in my account by 0pm on the thursday .
0	less_than a 00 hour turnaround !
0	i was worried that the quoted price may change after the phone had been expected ( the phone was in working order but had very minor surface_scratches and cracks ).
0	but no , the quoted amount was sent directly_into my bank_account with no question .
0	the whole_process of making the order was really smooth and i didn_'_t feel left in the dark at any time .
0	every_step of making the order was highly informative and plenty of options were given as to the method of posting .
0	as well as this , the terms and conditions were really clear and the important stuff was highlighted on the relevant_information .
0	highly_recommended and would definitely use again .
0	after years of struggling with computers which barely managed to run fsx , let_alone run it well , toby and james talked_me through my options and provided a system which runs fsx really well - so_far , not a single_issue with reliability or performance .
0	i '_m finally able to max out graphics settings , and to do a long_haul flight from london to hong_kong with absolute_confidence it won_'_t crash the pc .
0	it was at a good price too - far more affordable than the other systems i looked at .
0	it was a additional bonus that the w0f guys were always available by phone , that i always spoke to the same few people , that they went the extra_mile to build what i was looking for - in all_respects a really great customer experience .
0	the best experience and help bus driver on return .
0	i was worried at first about the car , but the website put at ease .
0	brillaint service this is my second phone with a massive price difference from the first one and i have always got the full_amount .
0	good service , will use them again and suggest to others .
0	good prices , fast delivery - what else do you need !
0	excellent service .
0	by now i have been using transferwise for about a year and a half .
0	throughout this period i have made over 00 transfers - each and every one of those was executed quickly and professionally .
0	i have had experiences with different money transfer companies such as moneygram , regular banks and western_union .
0	transferwise is by far the best company in the aforementioned list .
0	the company is young so currencies are few but i see a prolific future for this promising enterprise .
0	thank_you transferwise , for making transferring_money easy , fast and cheap !
0	palju edu ka tulevikus !
0	i ordered a few bits for my once weekly climbing sessions .
0	it was delivered in a flash , the website made choosing very easy , i will_definitely buy more kit with these_guys as i need it .
0	i don_'_t have much to say , but think of what you ' d expect and it '_s better .
0	sales advice is fantastic , and the item arrived almost before i ' d ordered it .
0	i always use broadbandbuyer , its simple , easy , good website , great advice and reliable .
0	smooth ordering , quick delivery and a great product .
0	thanks !
0	they '_ve an extensive_range of wellies and socks , all at reasonable prices , and really quick delivery .
0	can '_t fault it
0	would definatly_use this service again .
0	often find some great deals on here .
0	delivery was extremely fast and efficient and got my stuff the next_day !
0	never had a problem through just eat - always works_fine .
0	sometimes the orders are incorrect but that '_s the fault of the takeaway itself for being careless and not reading orders properly .
0	if you don_'_t get what you ordered , it '_s the fault of the restaurant and not just eat .
0	just eat is just an online directory .
0	as an analogy ; if you use the yellow_pages to find a plumber and the plumber is rubbish - that '_s not yellow_pages '_s fault .
0	you don_'_t then start slagging off the yellow_pages , you slag of the plumber who did the work .
0	the same_applies to just eat ; if you buy a takeaway through just eat and that takeaway is rubbish , it '_s not just eat '_s fault .
0	they '_ve done their work by relaying your order , which is all that '_s required of them .
0	i '_ve placed 0 orders with them , after about 0_weeks only 0 of them has tracked so have had to lodge claims for the sake of about 00p an item :
0	0 with rubbersoles . co . uk which tracked immediately with no_problems
0	0 with play . com which have not tracked at all
0	0 with tesco which has also not tracked
0	i guess it all depends on the reliability of the merchant to report the sale to top_cashback , which it is not in their best_interests to do .
0	i will keep using them , but if there '_s any more of this i won_'_t bother as it '_s not worth my time to keep chasing amounts of 00p odd .
0	i bought some shoes from here through top_cashback as they were a good price with the cashback .
0	placed the order and within 0 days my shoes had arrived .
0	i was a bit_dubious whether the shoes would turn_up because after i placed the order i suddenly noticed they use hermes as their courier service , which are not the most reliable firm around .
0	however on this occasion the all_round service was top_notch so would definitely use them again .
0	customer service was also good and kept me updated as to the whereabouts of the order .
0	cashback : so_far this is the only company who has actually honored the cashback offer they provide and confirmed the purchase immediately .
0	very pleased with this aspect also .
0	de_bestilte varer er_altid kommet til_tiden .
0	har dog aldrig haft brug for kundeservice så kan_ikke udtale mig og_den .
0	men_det klart et_sted jeg_vil anbefale .

0	i am a short - film maker , and amateur_photographer .
0	i was looking at upgrading my kit , as there were some things that would help me on other cameras , that i didn_'_t have on mine .
0	i started out with the canon_000d , and this wasn_'_t enough for me , so i looked around , and i found that the canon_00d would suit me .
0	the professional look , with the qualities i needed , however the price was a little too high .
0	i then thought about second_hand purchasing , so i looked around , and stumbled_upon mpb_photographic , and i can truly say the service was incredible .
0	it took 0 days to deliver , it came out of the box like it was brand_new and everything seemed to be okay .
0	i had also been talking to one of their employees for a long time about selling my camera with them as well .
0	which , because of their service , i think i will do in the future .
0	so , overall , they are a great company , with great prices , great services and they are very helpful .
0	as title_suggests .
0	great site , with a huge_range .
0	excellent customer service , would happily_recommend this to anyone !
0	very efficient and accomodating service , thanks
0	i bought a pile of gear , namely a vape - only clearomizer from libertyflights a long while back .
0	along with a pile of unmixed liquid , of which i was warned to start with premade instead :
0	but i went_ahead and mixed anyway , with some help from a representative at libertyflights over the phone , and i '_ve steaped it and vaped it , and it '_s brilliant to this day !
0	thanks for that !
0	:)
0	---
0	and both the e_- cig & the liquid ; to this day are my favorite way to start the day , so i bought another set ' just in case '.
0	i received it not long ago and despite my excitement , and love of newer and better gadgets ...
0	i couldn_'_t but help use my old trusty clearomizer , which in other eyes would be long over due a replacement .
0	non the less all of the gear is going_strong and better_than ever .
0	a sign of amazing quality and value .
0	thanks again for your great products ...
0	the pink elephant liquid is also a fantastic creation !

0	- chris booth : 0
0	great service , great communication .
0	took the hassle out of buying and was kept up to date at all_stages .
0	equipment exactly as advertised and well_packaged .
0	top_notch .
0	totally love this company , no delays , no_problems + excellent prices !
0	tottaly recommend it !
0	used these_guys to buy tools and bits and bobs for diy onwards over the years , and have found them to be generally very good .
0	sometimes they don_'_t have the product in store but the deliveries i '_ve had have been good with glitches ironed_out well .
0	always found them to be excellent , and they often set the standard for customer_services .
0	astonighing considering the range of goods they carry , they ' re my go to site ( and most peoples )!
0	only wish they ' re search_functions in sidebar were better but then again no one else carries this range so it '_s probably the best you could expect given the choice !
0	can '_t_argue with the facts people , amazon as it stands today is a safe_bet for buying !
0	me and my partner both order from m & m and they '_ve been good .
0	the difficulty with buying on line ( especially clothes ) is sizing but we '_ve found if we ' re a bit_iffy between sizes and there is the option then buying both sizes and paying up front for returns via the pop in package drop_off centres they use is cheaper and faster_than parking in town !
0	another success and they ' re generally very fast at refunding returned items , usually taking a day or 0 maxumum , just as it should be .
0	will_continue to use , but would be nice if they carried more small / medium clothes or had a slightly bettwe size search_function as we ' re not all built like weebles !
0	make_sure you update your website offers as fara in advance as possible , and possibly ( a la aldi . com . au ) put your grocery prices so even if we can '_t order online we can compare .
0	other than that , brilliant store , occasional problems with goods ( usually incorrectly stored cold items like cheese ) which can be a bit_annoying but accept this and save_money as it '_s on the way home !
0	having had faulty items from another big company ( which they dealt_with well but were unable to supply working items ) i bought from tesco direct .
0	items arrived very quickly ( surprised by yodels ' efficiency in this case as have heard mixed reports ) and the items were exactly as needed .
0	chap on the desk was friendly and not the first time i have used direct , as delivery to the desk is free and can be combined with the shopping !
0	yes they ' re big and they have made mistakes on orders sometimes , but they do seem to rectifiy them well .
0	we get our dog_food from these_guys ( last 0 years ), a very small local operation who deliver in the east_midlands .
0	they do sometimes take a week to deliver but as we order in plenty of time this is never an issue and the value is very good .
0	the deliveries are always by a really friendly delivery woman and the service on email and phone is also great .
0	on the one occasion in the last 0 years when food was delayed , they called us to let us now , which was nice .
0	ordered some panniers and they arrived when they were supposed to , and were exactly as advertised .
0	as good as going into branch and buying them , just as internet_shopping should be !
0	every consumer occasionally has difficulties , the challenge of buying sight_unseen in some cases .
0	in play '_s case , they have typically dealt promptly with any questioons , and have provided information and assistance over a few_years worth of purchases .
0	sometimes delivery is slow , other times fast ( slow being around their estimated delivery , fast being next_day !)
0	but on the whole i have been very impressed .
0	case in point , i purchased a micro_sd_card around a year_ago ( 00 months ), never thought to check it '_s speed .
0	when changin phones , i noticed it was class 0 and i was sure i ' d bought class 0 ( which i had ).
0	despite the purchase being over a year_ago , play apologised , accepted return , and sent the item i should originally have received .
0	i was very impressed , and will be rewarding that with further_purchases , as play are also ( usually ) fairly competitive , and a couple of pounds on larger purchases isn_'_t as much of a deal_breaker as poor service .
0	well_done so_far play . com !
0	original review - i would not purchase from ebuyer again ( after spending c . £ 0 , 000 over the last 0 - 0 years ) based on their response to my recent return under the distance_selling_regulations , where their trained squirrel quoted an oftguidance document and beleived it to take precedence over the actual legislation !
0	' i know about the sale of goods_act ' was her response , which was nice , but tht ' a s a different piece of legislation to the distance_selling_regulations 0000 and the oft document is open to interpretation whereas the legislation is clear on leaving the customer out of pocket for returns under the0 day period of the distance sellings regs !
0	suffice to say ( fortunately i am in the legal profession so my fees will be coming out of ebuyers pocket ) taking them to small_claims court as it is a principal that amazon , play , and other good e_- tailers don_'_t abuse .
0	will shop at amazon or dabs from now on as always had excellent service and well trained_staff .
0	that said , very little has ever been returnred to any of them !
0	updated following the very fast ' response ' from ebuyer '_s nikki .
0	absolute diddly squat !
0	funny how they can instantly respond to such reviews and ' sound ' great and concerned to anyone reading them , but then ... still do nothing !
0	if their service was as good as their responding to poor reviews , then there would probably be no poor reviews !
0	update !
0	should have updated this a while ago !
0	ebuyer did remedy this issue and acknowledged that it was the goods at fault .
0	although they required chasing which should have been needed , they did reimburse my out of pocket expenses in sending back the defective goods .
0	note that they took less_than an_hour to test the items to find them not suitable .
0	as such , i have altered the rating to 0_stars as this is a ' middle of the road ' experience now that resolution has passed rather_than a truly_awful one .
0	hopefully they will have learnt from the customer service experience .
0	i will find out when making future_purchases .
0	called jl and they advised me store had stock and would price match ( never_knowingly undersold my ar $ e !
0	).
0	walked to store to be faced with clueless ' we don_'_t stock that ' response .
0	useless and poor internal comms !
0	very dissapointed with experience , purchased from a different retailer in the end .
0	ordered an item ( garish pink fleece for my better half ).
0	arrived in 0 days .
0	not only that , but online discount on their website didn_'_t track , and when i phoned , they refunded the amount that was supposed to be discounted straight_away , very impressive !
0	would use them again if this is the level of service they offer !
0	after telling_me that my prescription was out of date and not giving me time to get a new one , they charged me £ 0 . 00 admin_fees and £ 0 . 00 bank charges .
0	thieves !
0	avoid at all costs .
0	after comparing a number of different sites , i decided to buy from pc_specialist .
0	they had the best price on the clevo laptop i wanted .
0	perfect !
0	always buy my protein_shakes and supplements from here when i run out .
0	especially their reflex products since they ' re usually the cheapest around and delivery is always prompt and packed well .
0	ordered a pc case from box . co . uk and it arrived pretty quickly .
0	very well_packaged but the best thing about them was how they would update you on your order .
0	as usual with most shops online they send you a confirmation_email and the order dispatch email but box . co . uk also send you a text_message to your phone !
0	just_incase you couldn_'_t get to a computer at_least you ' d be made aware about the status of your item .
0	will hopefully be ordering from box . co . uk again .
0	you need to experience quality - that '_s why dj_deals is the best - you can feel the quality coming to you from the click to the delivery .
0	quick , professional and reliable service i trust when it comes to my gear .
0	bought a redsub bod - 0 bass distortion pedal on a whim to see what it sounded_like .
0	very impressed with build quality ( as this is own_brand stuff ) and sound quality for the price !
0	very fast postage and good communication so would definitely use again !
0	bought pair of makita_drills for £_00 less_than i could_find them anywhere_else hadn_'_t used the site before so some reservations but extremely easy transaction and quick delivery so will_definitely be back !
0	the eyewear_outlet store was fantastic , an amazing range from stock and delivered next_day for a very competitive rate , what i really liked was the confirmation of delivery , i got a txt and an email from them saying when it would be delivered , to the hour !
0	very impressed and will_definitely use them again !
0	best seller online ... safe transaction . great customer service .. most recomended .
0	couldnt be better really if youve_got a flat tyre you dont need to think about getting your car to a garage just get it changed where it is
0	bought a jim root telecaster got e_- mails and texts the next_day letting_me know the hour of the day when it would arrive will_definitely use again
0	i think she should be promoted , or given a large pay_rise as she helped my business out hugely today
0	fantastic service ,
0	i could say a lot about webtogs , but i really want you to go and explore for yourselves .
0	you won_'_t regret it for a second ...
0	great products and advice at every_stage of your online journey .
0	personal service delivered with care and attention .
0	swift delivery and great after - care .
0	the list_goes on ...
0	webtogs has provided one of my best online shopping_experiences , and like many of the other_reviewers here , i will use them again and again .
0	customer service is so important nowadays , but often forgotten by many .
0	webtogs has got it right on the money and is leading the way .
0	ordered bred 00 from the site and they gave_me a box with a huge crease in it like it was on the bottom of a heavy stack
0	driver was very helpful in working around my time in order to deliver the parcel to me that day .
0	i had had to go out in the morning but was able to speak_directly with the driver to adjusted and made sure he got to me when i was back home .
0	great service !
0	great idea and very easy to use .
0	nice to get some cash for something that is otherwise just sitting_around in the drawer .
0	very easy service to use .
0	efficient .
0	arrived within 00_hours with the cheapest of the shipping options .
0	product was really well priced and i would definitely buy from here again .
0	i was so used to paying huge sums of money for the supplements me and my husband would use .
0	i just got so tired of it that we were going to just stop using anything at all .
0	luckily enough i stumbled_upon supplementwarehouse . com .
0	i was more than ecstatic to see that they have a price checker right there next to the item , so that just in case that they aren_'_t the absolute lowest_price they will check and beat it ( can we say " awesome ").
0	plus all the free_samples and gizmos they give you with each purchase will have me coming_back from now on .
0	don_'_t pay high prices for drug store chains with big markups .
0	discovered brown_bear just recently and fell in love with their coffee !
0	excellent site and super_fast delivery !
0	will be back for more and more …. my wife tells_me i '_m addicted lol .
0	not even fully with first_utility yet but after a week of trying to contact them im heading back to my previous_supplier .
0	sent an email to them on monday , got a automated_reply and heard_nothing since .
0	tried to call on monday with no joy .
0	tried again today and again no joy .
0	read the reviews on this site and low and behold they answered first time when i said i wanted to join .
0	i then got transfered both_times and cut_off .
0	customer service is obviously low on their company values .
0	ta ta
0	i ordered some window_lock keys from lockandkey . co . uk as they had the most competitive price i could_find .
0	having ordered and paid by paypal , i received an email a few hours_later to say that the order had been despatched .
0	i received the order the following_day .
0	the items were what i was expecting .
0	excellent experience all_round .
0	i ordered a humax hdr0000s freesat pvr from electricshop .
0	this was my first ever order with them .
0	i chose electricshop as they were the cheapest reputable store i could_find on the web .
0	order communication was good , and the item arrived promptly today .
0	however , when i opened the grey mail bag , i was very disappointed to discover that this item had just been shipped in its retail packaging , and not in a box .
0	this is not ideal for fragile products that contain hdds .
0	i actually ordered a youview_box direct from humax last_week , and that was sent in a strong_cardboard_box and packed with additional airbags to insulate the product from the inevitable rough_handling by couriers .
0	if humax ship their products like this , then so should resellers of their products .
0	i have now placed 0 web orders with tool line in 0000 .
0	i find their prices to be unbeatable and the range of goods they offer is far wider than what can be browsed using the categories on their website - the trick is to use the search box .
0	i have had to make changes to several orders and sending them an email during business hours always generates a helpful response within an_hour .
0	next_day delivery by citylink is free for orders over £_00 which is a lower threshold than many of their competitors .
0	i have recommended tool line to a number of my friends who have also found them to be keenly_priced and efficient .
0	i ordered some pens from cult_pens .
0	their prices were good , especially the p_&_p .
0	the pens arrived quickly and even included a free pen to thank me for my order .
0	i would purchase from cult_pens again .
0	awesome site , easy to use , loads of choice :)
0	i had an issue that resulted_in royal_mail holding back the product i purchased due to unpaid postage .
0	however , a guy from the sales_team got in contact with me asking what had happened .
0	nevertheless , the problem was simply dealt_with and gadget case had refunded me the cost of retrieving the item .
0	the matter was greatly handled and a good customer_satisfaction after the issue .
0	i use iphone for internet ..
0	it took me 00mins to leave a review for a company it only took me 0 mins to book return transfers from airport to hotel not happy .. takes 0 sec delay for what you type to come up on screen ..
0	same del in tryin to navigate site :(
0	just used suntransfers for the first time , having received a really good quote for a return transfer for 00 guys on a stag , from palma_airport to magalluf , and i could not fault the service at all .
0	both drivers were courteous , the vehicles were clean and included the necessary child_seat if needed .
0	the pre_- holiday booking service allowed_me to make changes without_any extra money taken a nice_surprise when most travel companies try to charge more .
0	i will_certainly use suntransfers for all my future transfers .
0	p . s it was easier to book suntransfers . com return booking than it was to submit this review :(
0	preorder went well received with plenty of time for preload .
0	fast at support , plan . io provide a great full featured issue reporting system .
0	always polite and always helpful they even anticipated our request to map a new sub - domain when our company re - branded .
0	in short this has taken the hassle out of many of our project_management hosting issues and allowed_us to concentrate on managing projects instead of managing our project_management !
0	ffx are a fantastic company to deal with - i placed my order over the phone with a very helpful member of staff who was very knowledgeable and a pleasure to deal with .
0	the processing and delivery was very fast and efficient and i will_definitley be using the company again .
0	i will recommend ffx to others .
0	this is a first_class service , i placed my order online and two_days_later my tyres were fitted , during the process black_circles were keeping_me up to date with my order via_email and a call .
0	very highly_recommended !
0	!
0	had an issue all of my own doing and the help livechat assistant , richard_mileham , was so helpful , sorted my issue promptly , politely and with great ease .
0	yet more great service from parcel0go . com
0	quick delivery backed_up with fantastic customer service .
0	you can '_t ask for more from an online_retailer .
0	i ordered replacement headphone tips for my klipsch earphones .
0	as one of only 0 authorised retailers which have online stores i quickly ordered with them .
0	sure_enough 00minutes later i had a email_confirming my order had been dispatched .
0	it arrived the next_day before 0am with a lollipop thrown in too .
0	i liked that touch .
0	would definitely recommend !
0	i ordered a brilliant cheap guitar from this site not only is it great value it looks brilliant but i got it in just one day i was emailed with details of my order going through and i was emailed and texted as soon as the order had been dispatched and i was also given all the tracking_information which came in handy i spoke to them with a query_regarding the order and they answered to the best of their ability they are a brilliant site with some great guitars i really recommend the semi_acoustic_guitars which you can find by typing in semi_acoustic in the search box great value brilliant
0	i had an excellent experience with ritehome and can recommend them highly .
0	at a fraction of the cost of a regular agent they helped_me secure a tenant and were great at staying in contact during the whole_process .
0	i bought two things online both from croydon .
0	both said dispatched emails one arrived promptly the other i waited the 0 days and then mailed .
0	no response - mailed again the next_day copying in info_@ - again no response .
0	raised a complaint with paypal asking again polity where it was - no apology just a tracking_number : it was sent on the day i fist asked where it was - obviously that had prompted them into sending it .
0	why couldn_'_t they just sent a email_saying sorry - its in the post now ?
0	another complaint - sent a email to feedback @ and also got no response - obviously a arrogant company that think they are doing us a favor by allowing us to buy from them .
0	i don_'_t order much from amazon anymore , i find their prices tend to be more_expensive than other_companies and out of the 0 recent orders in which i paid for a timed delivery i have only received 0 on time .
0	however i did receive the money back for the delivery
0	i have used aria for a couple of purchases recently both were cheaper_than anywhere_else and the delivery was next_day .
0	their prices are updated very regular and if your a active_forum member you can get free delivery on some items .
0	top_notch company
0	save a ton of money , and time ordering through supplementwarehouse . com .
0	the best on the web .
0	don_'_t know how you guys do it , but keep it up and you '_ll have my money .
0	god_awful service from dabs
0	god help anyone who_uses this company .
0	il begin with the web_site stating my solid_state drive would be in stock in 0 - 0 days , 0 days_later i got bored of waiting and removed this order since it was a compleate load of rubish that it will be arriving within 0 days
0	so ...... my order gets shipped , and some arrives , not everything is there though , infact a graphics_card i payed 000 £ for which has_been taken from my account , isnt in the delivery , even_though its in the delivery note , i email them and im re - embursed , i take a look at there site and see the graphics_card ...... whilst iv been waiting for the ssd to come in has_gone off offer , so even_though i payed for the item while it was on offer it was taken from my delivery , and then it was me who had to chase them for re - embursment
0	so then my chasis arrives , the pacaging is perfect , the styrofone is perfect and holds its so well it takes 0 grown men to get the chassis out of the box , soooo .... how has the internal parts of the chasis been shattered , its because its a b - grade product , iv been charged for a full product .
0	and im still_waiting for this issue to be resolved even after 0 emails , and over a month .
0	now after 0 days shy of a whole month waiting for my monitor it has arrived , soaking_wet and damaged
0	out of intrest i sent them an email letting them know i wanted to send my soaking_wet monitor back on friday_morning ( 0nd sept ), and still no response , they will want to courier it back which will take 0 days to arange and a day to take place , at best .
0	my job takes me away from my hometown and although im not strugling for money i would have been looking at taking a new contract last_week , yet im still stuck here with no answers , not even replys to my emails
0	i spent an_hour on the phone they never even picked_up , what a joke , no reply to my emails
0	nothing .....
0	all i want is to be able to return the faulty goods iv been delivered , and i should at_least get back half the cash for the chasis
0	thankyou for reading this post , any help or advice would be greatly appreicated , since at the moment im realy restraining myself from emailing them telling them im going to take them to court

0	after making an order online i rang to make a small change ( tariff ) to my pre_- order for a sony_xperia z , the rep i spoke to said they couldnt amend my order , all they could do was cancel and resubmit it but i was more concerned to hear my application had not been accepted and i had not been contacted despite having made this order 00 days earlier !
0	i assumed this was an_oversight as the person mentioned there was only one t in my name on the bank details so i went back online to resubmit the application .
0	i rang back to check if this went through ok only to be told i had been declined by o0 , no explanation was offered as to why .
0	i therefore rang o0 ( as im an existing customer ) only for them to tell me as an existing client i would be an " automatic accept " and they had no record of my application from their end !
0	rang back carphone_warehouse to explain the above , no satisfactory_explanation just told me i had been declined due to adverse credit , this is utter nonsense as i have since seen my equifax credit_report which has no marks or blemishes and scores me as " excellent ", the only offer your staff made was to try another network .
0	i am totally confused as to why i have actually been declined by cpw / o0 and quite_frankly am discusted with the service i have received from them .
0	since i have seen my credit_report ( and its fine ) i have asked them to tell me specifically why my application has_been declined , surprisingly they couldnt tell me .
0	i have since ordered my experian report which already shows my search by orange ( which i arranged through dial a phone ) which was several days after trying cpw but surprisingly no searches showing for cpw / o0 which suggests a credit search was never even carried_out .
0	it all stinks of misinformation and im none the wiser
0	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0	edit_: 00 / 00 / 00 - well its 0 working_days on and no comment from cpw - bad_publicity on trustpilot is one thing but we '_ll see what watchdog have to say about it if cpw cant be_bothered to respond on here .
0	the service just eat provides is fantastic , long gone are the days of trying to phone your local takeaway and getting that annoying line busy tone !
0	yes they charge 00p for the benefit of the service they provide but its worth it !
0	there is also far more choice than other online inferior rivals .
0	i have used the service now for about 0 years , heres to the next 0 !
0	cheers just eat .

0	used this service for the first time to get a motorbike delivered .
0	saved me about three hours of a round_trip and probably saved me money over the petrol cost .
0	will use again if the need pops_up !
0	as always great products at a very good price and super_fast delivery .
0	wouldn_'_t dream of going anywhere_else !
0	very fast and perfect service
0	great great .
0	ordered the key at 00 noon on sunday , and although it said between 00mins - 0 hours i was expecting abit longer due to it being sunday but it was delivered within half an_hour , had a tiny scare when the code didnt work but i realised i had typed it in wrong ( stupid me ) but really easy and quick service , much recommended !

0	we at zoukmobile been working with txtnation for the past 0 years_now and we have nothing but praises for their conduct and service reliability although there were issues here and there we know these were not in their control and they always push on to provide us the best in terms of service !

0	this site has the best deals for any supplements .
0	i brought some new windsurfing sails from boylos . co . uk this month .
0	the guys there were extremely_helpful and really knew there stuff .
0	not only did they give me some good advice but made sure i had the sails in time for the weekend .
0	thanks to the team , will use again for sure .
0	i ordered a custom laptop from pc_specialist because i couldn_'_t find a pre_- built machine that met my specifications .
0	the most difficult part of the whole_process was deciding where to draw the line in terms of the wealth of options_available - with all hardware offered at very reasonable prices .
0	it took a bit of time to get built - i think it took about 0_weeks from order to delivery , but i hadn_'_t opted for an express option so no_complaints there .
0	a couple of my chosen parts where unavailable , but these were upgraded to the next available part at no extra_cost .
0	on delivery , the laptop worked_perfectly , exactly as i expected from the spec .
0	windows was sensibly set_up , with no extra ' bonus ' programs clogging things up .
0	i would heartily_recommend pc_specialist to anyone .
0	cheap , efficient , next_day delivery - can '_t fault shopto . net .
0	will be using them again ...
0	ive bought parts and sold parts to flatout , and they certainly have the customer in mind and consumer satisfaction !
0	in regards to selling on items , i really found it easy and straight_forward you send them details and within_00hours there back with a response so quick and easy and prices are suprisingly really good in most_cases , also with buying used items from them , product condition is always great and serviced were it can be before sold on .
0	certainly recommend .
0	i wish the site was more user_friendly ; being_able to view all supplements related to what a user is searching .
0	i believe this would help in overall sales proffits , and helping the consumer to find the best supplement for them , seeing how supplements are different for every body type .
0	fast delivery and a great item .
0	fantastic .
0	item arrived on time and was quite cheap , but customer_services were very poor indeed when something went wrong
0	they now ship new_releases from the uk , so there is no waiting involved .
0	i '_ve been getting some big releases early recently too .
0	big_fan of their site , best on the web for games imo
0	fantastic idea and absolutely_beautiful when mixed truly epic product !!
0	!
0	quite_simply powerbody are second to none on service .. they are the only company whom offer the following
0	deal of the week - with products voted by customers
0	free_giveaways on fb_page
0	free supplements to useful members of their forums
0	complete stacks free to log on their forums .
0	this combined with a close knit community spirit , helpful videos , fun conversations ( without shameless plugs or spam ) and freindly approachable staff makes them the only company i have used since the summer
0	i received my order quickly and it was the best price around at the time .
0	it only took about a week from the moment i confirmed it on the website until i got the money for the phone and it wasn_'_t too bad a price considering it was a fairly old phone .
0	i started the live_chat as i was unaware of the whereabouts of my parcel regardless of the parcel tracker .
0	emma assisted_me and i was able to determine when my parcel would be delivered to me .
0	thanks emma :) merry_xmas
0	i have been following the blogs on the website for a while now , some good information on he celta course as i am hoping to start that soon .
0	also taken on the grammar challenge ...
0	i didn_'_t do too bad : d
0	learning a lot on the course at the moment , great customer_support as well .
0	overall really pleased .
0	thanks !
0	i have been with vodafone over 0 years ... and not been happy with the bills , customer_services and generally the whole company !!
0	!
0	i had been over charged on each bill for no apparent_reason and took me over 0 years to get my money back for the over charge !!
0	i had to go through my bills each_month an check properly .. just to see where they will charge me extra !
0	not happy at all !
0	if i could have left the stars blank i would have !
0	( unless you can : p ).
0	i have purchased a lot of supplements from these_guys , great prices and fast delivery .

0	0 hours of phone_calls and im now waiting for a manager to call me back , but the way ive been dealt_with so_far im not expecting a call .
0	the " customers service " advisors are the most incompetent patronising and unproffesional i have ever_dealt_with .
0	i have a contract with o0 as well and have been for 00 years which will_definately stop at the and of the contract .
0	phone service and reception is also very poor and mobile internet is poor at best , if i can get a signal .

0	advice ranging_from finances to legal information !
0	the title say it all .
0	i have had my hosting_package for six_years_now and changed my primary domain a couple of times - effortless support with knowledgeable support staff ( how refreshing )!
0	the prices are unbeatable - by far the best hosting company i have ever used !
0	a great review site with a clear and easy to use interface .
0	do not book a collection when it '_s cold - it will not get collected as all their couriers are afraid of snow , ice or even the prospect of snow and ice .
0	it took 00 days for one of my parcels to be delivered !
0	their service is the cheapest door - 0 - door service .
0	all items can be tracked online .
0	customer service is poor - i am still_awaiting a response to a delay claim .
0	great range of shoes for large footed people and reasonable prices too .
0	fast dispatch although p_&_p is pricey at £ 0 . 00 !
0	service is excellent - returned shoes as they were damaged , received the new pair before i even got a chance to return the damaged pair !
0	products are crazy and fun !
0	service is outstanding - i ordered wednesday for friday delivery , dispatched wednesday_evening , thursday_afternoon i was told i had to work so a quick call to firebox and my parcel was re - routed to my work address .
0	totally effortless and so helpful !
0	one word of warning - their prices are quite high .
0	shop around before buying as you may save a packet !
0	all my batteries are bought through battery - force . co . uk now !
0	their batteries are excellent value for money , beating the highstreet prices by at_least 00 %.
0	p_&_p is also cheap too with a variety of options .
0	novelty : they scan your purchases on dispatch and attach the image in an email - plus you get a tasty chocolate too with every purchase !
0	interparcel are the ' middle - men ' agents between couriers and customers .
0	i dispatch all my sales through interparcel - they are cheap and cheerful !

0	delivery status is visible at the click of a button and i can provide my customers with a link too !
0	personal use , again no issues what - so - ever !
0	thoroughly_recommend them for price , service and helpful ' ness !
0	first things first , parcel0go acts as a ' middle - man ' agent between the courier companies and the customer .
0	because they give so much business to the courier companies , they get bulk discounts !
0	unfortunately , parcel0go is giving honest couriers a bad name !
0	i have used parcel0go on two occasions , first time the parcel collection failed , twice .
0	hdnl were apparently instructed to collect on 00th_jan but the delivery driver had paperwork that suggested otherwise .
0	second time i had a time - dependant package to send !
0	the parcel was not collected so i cancelled the order only to find out that the 0 % surcharge on paypal payments is apparently non - refundable .
0	they do not state anywhere that this surcharge is non - refundable - so after arguing with a belligerent customer_support agent ( who i later found out was a senior_manager and owner ...) for twenty_minutes and threatening various actions they finally agreed to refund my money i was rightfully owed !
0	finally , their only form of contact is via_email or on - line chat .
0	the on - line chat takes_forever to get connected to a person ( average 00_mins )!
0	this company is run by a bunch of crooks and hopefully they will go out of business very soon and save a lot of people , a lot of hassle !
0	hilarious and politically incorrect shirts at great value prices !
0	no extortionate shipping fees for international addresses , good customer service , easy to use ordering system and speedy dispatch ( considering items are printed to order ...)!

0	had a look on the official site and tickets were in excess of $_000 a piece , so hunted_around , found ticketloot and bought three tickets , same block for $_000 total !!
0	!
0	ticketloot act as the sales platform between punters and sellers - great service , secure payments and timely status_updates plus satisfaction_guarantee too !
0	cannot wait to see the rangers vs . panthers !
0	every order i place i seem to have to return something because the item is faulty , sized incorrectly or not as advertised .
0	customer service staff are not too clever by the responses i get , they appear to fail at the basics of reading an email .
0	additionally , when i item is exchanged , they automatically add £ 0 . 00 p_&_p again and every time i have to email and ask them to refund it - getting very tiresome !
0	good joe browns range and £ 0 . 00 next_day delivery is great value .
0	a totally unique and unparalleled ' all - in - one ' suit / thing !
0	easy to use website .
0	will buy again !

0	as much as we may look upon these tv_ads and large organisations as rip_off_merchants , i think it is now time for people to become realistic .
0	mazuma have taken my phone , and put cash into my account , simple !.
0	they have given me a better price than any small retailer , and trust me i have been to loads over the last 0_weeks .
0	so .......... get onto mazuma and let the small rip_off shops rott .
0	this company is a success for a reason , they are good .
0	you '_ve heard the saying " if it sounds too good to be true then it probably is ", well with flubit it isn_'_t !
0	!
0	saved good amounts of money on a few items now - that '_s after an exhaustive web search to find the best prices i could .

0	very good delivery time , especially for free delivery .
0	will probably continue using this company because the service is very quick and easy to use .
0	they are okay if you register before days like easter .
0	i ordered my domain on friday ( it '_s now saturday ) and they have said i have to wait for monday !
0	this is fustrating !
0	live_chat not very helpful neither .
0	spoke to erick on the online_chat_facility as i was having problems redeeming my voucher .
0	i gave him the code and he sorted it all for me with little_effort on my behalf
0	a friend who had previously used mazuma_mobile had highly_recommended them .
0	after using them myself , i have found the service extremely fast and excellent value .
0	by using the " print your own pack " option , the money was in my bank_account within 0 days !
0	i will_definitely use them again .
0	great site explains everything a person needs to know , depending on what form you buy your herbs i bought tinctures as they are said to be more potent and easier to consume the site explains how to prepare them etc ..
0	i phoned indigo to ask about certain things to which i was greeted with great service and help , the items arrived on time , packaged well and most of all they work !
0	after the first day i could feel a genuine difference !
0	so when it comes to herbs i don_'_t think i will need to go_elsewhere , very pleased with this company !
0	first of all the e_- hardware website has a great layout for ease of use , everything was well described and informative .
0	in my case i just wanted to purchase a door_handle set so decided to phone them which was late on afternoon time , the call was tended to promptly and the service was friendly , fast and further to that my product arrived next_morning , excellent !
0	the product itself is high_quality and well_packaged , will be using and recommending e_- hardware in the future , top_drawer company !
0	thanks e_- hardware - matt speake
0	fast delivery .
0	good packing .
0	very easy to order , and free next_day delivery is superb !
0	superb website and the delivery is usually always next_day ( even_though it '_s a bit_pricey !
0	)....
0	but the products are the best price you will find anywhere and have helped_me with my training .
0	much_better value than big brand_names who sell the same thing .
0	i regularly use them and will_continue to do so
0	you order things , and days_later after chasing , they finally tell you it '_s out of stock and you '_ll get a refund , ok , that would be fine if , they didn_'_t have multiple companies around the uk that they own , doing the exact_same thing !
0	so you can try by the products elsewhere thinking it '_s in stock , get charged , then the same thing , they finally tell you they own the companies too
0	is it really that hard to keep your stock updated online ?!
0	three_times !
0	glad i found 0quid , could not ask for more .
0	joyetech is already well renowned for making superior vapor products , so i won_'_t wax poetical about them here , except to say that they deliver a quality product at a great price , and with the fastest , most convenient service i '_ve experienced in quite some time .
0	absolutely satisfied with my ego - c .
0	i always have a great experience when i order from supplementwarehouse .
0	their prices are the cheapest i can find and the shipping service is excellent !
0	a new shop in haverfordwest , this is really the only music shop worth dealing_with with if you ' re in pembrokeshire , cardiganshire or carmarthenshire .
0	a great selection of keyboards , stage pianos , drums , electric and acoustic_guitars , as well as pa equipment .
0	even if they don_'_t have what you need there , they ' re happy to get hold of it for you .
0	they '_ve got a great online store , which is really quite unique for a small shop .
0	they also hire out pa equipment and even have a yamaha music school downstairs , perfect if you ' re a beginner pianist , guitarist or drummer .
0	seriously nice people to deal with , who will do whatever they can to help .
0	brilliant customer service , great prices , free delivery .
0	and - get this - ordered nikon_d000 00am , arrived from_hong_kong the next_day in uk .
0	brilliant .
0	don_'_t buy from these , needed to cancel order , tried to charge me 00_% of total order to cancel it - how they still exist is beyond me .
0	efficient , friendly , helpful - everything you want from a bed company .
0	don_'_t be taken in by their cheap prices , or promises of good customer_support - this company , it seems , is a sham .
0	ordering a laptop , i was given a 0 - 0 day delivery window .
0	once ordered , the order status page then gave_me 0 - 00 days .
0	those 00 working_days have passed , and yet the order status is still ' on time '.
0	spending 00_minutes waiting for someone to answer my call , an indian lass answered , citing a ' delay ' in getting it dispatched , as if it were a valid excuse .
0	' next week ' she pulled_out of the air .
0	never going to happen .
0	they don_'_t have the stock , plain and simple .
0	getting a refund , or else my bank is getting involved .
0	do not ; i repeat do not under any circumstance think of dealing_with these jokers .
0	i guarantee you , wae_+ will not exist in 0 months time .
0	paypal takes such a massive cut out of your transactions , it almost isn_'_t worth it .
0	ebay takes such a huge cut , it '_s almost not worth selling on it .
0	item was out of stock , but they made sure to call and ask whether i would like to wait or cancel order ( very cheap too ).
0	0 * for excellent and personal service - very helpful staff really care about you as a customer ; it '_s like dealing_with your local shop in the 0000s - brilliant !
0	after an intensive internet hunt for a set of 0 barum_bravuris 0 tyres i found that national . co . uk had the best value for 0 new ( mid range ) tyres , balanced & fitted !!
0	great .
0	there are other_companies offering generic mid - range tyres for a lot less , however i know barum_bravuris 0 have a good reputation , and with national - at_least i know what brand i '_m getting .
0	i also found a 0 / 0 price wheel_alignment offer on their site which is worth going for !
0	hostelbookers makes traveling that much_easier and less_stressful when you are traveling from city to city !
0	its the best !
0	no_hassle transaction .
0	good as_described and arrived on time as promised .
0	fast dispatch as promised , no_problems , would use again .
0	great value protein , easy to mix and tastes good .
0	i wanted my fiancee to have an input when picking the engagement_ring of her dreams and she found it with ease at marlows .
0	we searched for styles online and had a decent idea of what we wanted before going to birmingham '_s jewellery_quarter .
0	marlow '_s had been recommended to us by friends and they did not let us down .
0	fantastic customer service , as trish explained all our options without_any pressure and with no sense of ' upselling ' to buy something we did not want .
0	the range of settings and diamonds that marlow '_s had available was vast , so we could_find exactly_what we wanted .
0	within 0 hours of selecting our diamond and our setting of choice the ring was made and ready for us to pick_up .
0	marlow '_s offer great after - care of it '_s rings , as they will polish and clean them each year .
0	we will be back to buy the matching wedding_bands and are so glad that we chose marlow '_s to be part of a very special shopping_experience .
0	the site has lots of products for sale at a good price and the free overnight delivery is great as you can order what ever before 0 : 00 pm and it will arrive the next_day , this service is great and i plan on using it more in the future .
0	optical_express has helped_me in so many ways .
0	after getting laser_eye surgury , my whole completly changed ; my confidence grew ; i had less stress of loosing and finding my glasses .
0	in the long_term i believe it was definatly the best financial option , rather that consistently buying new glassses and contactlenses .
0	had a quick query to do with an order i was in the process of making , and had a fully professional and prompt response to the query from the agent i spoke to ( samantha ).
0	highly_recommended
0	very happy with the experience received !
0	website is relatively easy to navigate and order from , picked a fitting_centre and got my confirmation in no time at all .
0	unfortunately the snowy_weather delayed my tyres getting to the fitting_centre but i was called the day before by black_circles to inform_me of this .
0	my fitting was rearranged and the old tyres swapped over to the new in less_than half an_hour for the 0 wheels !
0	great fitting_centre with helpful and friendly staff ( seems very rare on the isle of wight !)
0	i will_certainly be returning when i need more tyres !
0	highly_recommended !
0	i did know what i wanted which may have helped but it was very easy to find on the site and the shipping was incredibly fast .
0	great price too !
0	i ordered my v festival ticket through double0tickets . com and am amazed at how great they really are .

0	dean mendum , east grinstead
0	it is easy to use , cheap , and no booking_fees .
0	the layout is easy on the eye .
0	use these_guys , they rock .
0	seriously .
0	i '_ve been using them for years since the early days of dreamhosting ( their old name ) and i can only say that they are exception .
0	instant_replies on support , solving all kind of queries ( even those relating to my dodgy php !
0	).
0	would recommend them in a heart_beat .
0	they are genuinely one of those companies where you can '_t quite believe they exist , such is the quality of their service for the price the provide .
0	i always get my supplements from supplement_warehouse .
0	i have been a satisfied and loyal_customer for over a year .
0	there is a huge_selection , great prices , and the customer service is second to none .
0	i recommend subscribing to the newsletter .
0	it consists of current specials and discount_coupons toward the entire purchase .
0	supplement_warehouse is responsible for helping_me reach my potential .
0	thanks sw !
0	it took the money from my card very soon , but it haven_'_t dispatched the order for over one month !
0	and no one respond the email and phone_call !
0	!
0	many_thanks for your help with sorting the delivery of our parcel .
0	any_problems we will be contacting sammy taylor at parcels to go
0	amazing first transaction with digirev - i had some pre sales questions , all of which we ' re answered succinctly and quickly .
0	top_notch .
0	i will shop with them again .
0	even_though it was my first time at hostel_bookers , booking a hostel was easy as anything .
0	it took me only a minute to find a good value hostel and another minute to book it .
0	great experience
0	very high_quality products at very competitive_prices .
0	a warm and friendly service , and items dispatched and delivered extremely quickly !
0	i read good reviews for panelbase , it was even at the top of some survey lists .
0	however , my experience with them has_been the opposite .
0	very , very few surveys in comparison with other survey sites like valued opinions or mysurvey .
0	there is a very tedious profiling section to be completed at the beginning and it '_s all for nothing .
0	most of the time i '_m not even eligible for their surveys , yet they give them to me anyway ( at most one per week ).
0	terrible site and an_absolute waste of time .
0	avoid .
0	nothing good to say about it - really hate this site .
0	i know that people are generally opposed to change in all forms , but in facebook '_s case i think that user opposition is justified .
0	layout and feature overhauls aren_'_t uncommon , and after they are introduced it doesn_'_t seem to matter what people think - the changes are permanent .
0	they could do well by listening to feedback .
0	other than that , it is a solid social_networking site .
0	they '_ll probably stay on top for a long time , but the way that they ' re running things is giving plenty of opportunities for better sites to swiftly take away their users .
0	whether you ' re just casually looking for information on an_upcoming movie , or searching back for movies that you want to check out , your needs will be met .
0	as far as user controlled movie ratings go , imdb '_s scores are fairly good representations , though there are still pointless - and unavoidable - rating wars .
0	i '_ve also spent a good deal of time on the forums on the site , especially after watching a movie and looking for fan interpretations .
0	first off , i do purchase my music , but the prices on itunes are just off - putting sometimes .
0	i would go for the occasional album , but they just don_'_t seem to be throwing a lot of offers out there nowadays .
0	it can also be frustrating to search for music on their site and find out that they don_'_t have it .
0	it speaks for itself whenever you no_longer refer to searching on the internet , but " googling ".
0	top_notch search_engine , very popular email service ( which i can '_t comment on further since i don_'_t actively use it ) but they really flopped with their social_networking site .
0	but did they really need that anyway ?
0	their origin service is atrocious , their downloadable content schemes pathetic , and their respect for gamers nowhere to be found .
0	whilst they put out some decent games , gamers have to go against their principles to purchase them .
0	they '_ve taken enough franchises under their wing and prematurely buried them - amongst them some of my favourites .
0	and yet , all they have to do is respond to their criticism and listen to the customers .
0	the customer is always right , and ea should finally open their eyes to see that .
0	by the way , just look_elsewhere online to see the appalling services that ea have provided .
0	rarely you '_ll find an original and interesting article on ign .
0	however , their videos can be decent , ranging_from informative to humourous , and is the strong point of the site .
0	unfortunately , they are given an incentive to review certain games favourably , which really tarnishes ign '_s reputation amongst gamers .
0	for some reviews this is really obvious and distracting , especially compared to other gaming review sites ( but this practice of companies pushing for good reviews doesn_'_t just fall onto ign , don_'_t get me wrong ).
0	you might as well be reading a piece written by the lead developer of a game in some cases .
0	they do have some good writers , but they ' re just not given enough free will .
0	an overhaul is needed of their commenting system , which is poorly implemented and usually just serves the purpose of breeding criticism and arguments between users .
0	i don_'_t know how a company like dell can continue running their business with their current customer_support base .
0	their hardware is okay , far from the best out there , but does the job ... until some hidden self - destruct mechanism goes off after a predetermined time ( that '_s my belief anyway ).
0	i had a laptop for about three years before it kicked the bucket , and , to my surprise , i had forgotten about the warranty that i had with it .
0	it was actually due to run out about a month after the time of the laptop dying .
0	called up support , was redirected to india and was put on the line with totally_unhelpful staff that i couldn_'_t understand , and who probably couldn_'_t understand me .
0	if you think it '_s as simple as saying " my laptop is broken , and the warranty covers it , please come and send assistance " then think again .
0	after hours of multiple calls - each new call starting the whole_process over again - i was getting_nowhere .
0	first off , they don_'_t believe you .
0	they tried to diagnose my near dead laptop over the phone , which was an_absolute_nightmare .
0	i managed to somehow spark some life into it and go through a few bios checks over the phone with dell .
0	the results of that ?
0	inconclusive , but they " suspected " different problems .
0	i had to get a family_member braver than i to shout down the phone at them to send an engineer out .
0	on and on this went , and then they finally did their job , sent an engineer out who didn_'_t have the proper equipment .
0	on the phone again , they send another engineer who actually fixes the laptop .
0	woo !
0	then the laptop dies of the same problem two months later .
0	to summarise : avoid dell if you value your_sanity .
0	haven_'_t had a huge_amount of history with them , but they have a fairly good site and i haven_'_t run into any_problems ( yet ).
0	however , there '_s just something about paypal that i can '_t quite put my finger on ; it really feels_like they ' re lacking a useful presence .
0	i get the feeling that it would be a nightmare to resolve a problem with an exchange .
0	also , adding / changing addresses on the site is stupidly overcomplicated .
0	i '_ve been using amazon for years_now and they '_ve always been my first choice for buying online .
0	great prices , love the super_saver delivery that i usually put on orders , and any concerns that i '_ve had have always been dealt_with promptly by excellent customer service staff .
0	actually , i haven_'_t found as good customer service elsewhere on the net .
0	0 of us went to brighton and it was the dogs !
0	the hostel was everything we needed , the go_karting was really good !
0	chillisauce made the whole booking progess stress_free and a total breeze !
0	could not recommend them enough .
0	this is the worst customer service i have ever received .
0	initially was refunded for items not provided in the shipping .
0	the second time however was when the charger for my lavatube shorted while charging batteries , both malfunctioned .
0	was requested to send back the charger , which i did at my own_expense .
0	e_- mailed the company several_times , 00 days_later and still no response , no_indication of whether i '_ll be getting a refund or replacement for the cheapo charger they provide .
0	avoid !
0	ordered many many_times and they never_fail .
0	the bath looks great and is well appreciated by all the members of the
0	family .
0	got the bath at discounted price and with the facility of next
0	day delivery .
0	lucky me .
0	well the service was equally good and looking
0	forward to buy from you .
0	i won some prize from this site and its really very good to play .
0	no_hesitation and no extra_cost .
0	only pay for the play
0	excellent service , at impossibly short_notice , very professional problem handling and general management !
0	i found the whole_experience very easy and stress_free to use .
0	staff were more than helpful , and really did go the extra_mile where other_companies let_me down , i would and have recommended lenses for hire * to others and i will_certainly be using them again in the future .
0	the lens made my safari trip what it was , without it i would have returned with a very bleak portfolio of landscape images !

0	even paid £ 0 . 00 for the express delivery ( 0 - 0 days ).
0	was given an expected delivery date of 0 - 0 days_later than the 0 days for the express delivery .
0	decided that i would wait for the estimated delivery date .
0	this is the last day but still no sign of the items so i e_- mailed and called the customer_services .
0	i was told that the item was not at their warehouse but that it was expected to arrive today .
0	this however , means that the item will not get sent until monday and i will not receive it until tuesday ( 0 days after the express delivery i paid for and 0 days_later than the estimated delivery dates given !!!)
0	at the time of ordering the parts they were " in stock ".
0	at no point in all this was i informed that the item i ordered in was not in stock and would take longer to get here .
0	had i been informed of this i would have cancelled my order and gone elsewhere .
0	when i called them and spoke to their customer_services i asked for a refund on my express delivery as they had not kept to the time frame .
0	at this point i was told that i could have a store credit but not a refund to my card .
0	as if i would want to use them again after this experience .
0	time will now tell as to whether the parts arrive on tuesday or not but i will_certainly never use wae_+ again and will not be recommending them to anyone_else .
0	if you ' re thinking of buying from shopto then don_'_t hesitate .
0	i '_ve always received any pre_- ordered games on time and never had any_issues with the wrong game arriving or not receiving a game .
0	even better is the fact that they inform you by text when they have dispatched the games !
0	i cannot_fault the service at all .
0	i had to have the frame of my door repaired after i had to break into it once .
0	i called them straight after and i got an appointment the next_day .
0	the carpenter came right on time , took a look at the damage and got to fixing it .
0	he was done in about 00_mins , leaving no mess and i clouldn '_t even spot where the damage was before .
0	i must_say he was great and friendly .
0	ordered my flowers on 00 / 0 / 00 for delivery on 00 / 0 / 00 they have '_t arrived still no email or anything , i have called them 00times no one ever picked_up the phone ... avoid them !!!!
0	!
0	00 / 0 / 00 still no email or flowers what a scammers !!
0	!
0	it '_s hard to find a great company that stands behind their products while offering a reasonable price .
0	i have found both qualities here .
0	their customer service is prompt , courteous and professional , and did i mention timely ?
0	take_note fellow competitor bike parts companies , alwaysriding . co . uk is setting the bar for good service and great prices !
0	ok , so i was sceptical at first never_heard of coolshop !
0	plucked up the courage to make the purchase .
0	how grateful i am that i did .
0	ordered darksiders ii : collectors_edition ( ps0 ) as i stupidly didnt preorder the game beforehand >.<........ 0st good point : the price was a considerable_amount cheaper_than that of ' other ' retailers & they had stock which i couldn_'_t locate anymore from other stores .
0	0nd bonus : ( express 00 hour from when package gets to uk ) order was sent from copenhagen post on 00st_august , in uk by 00rd and * drum roll * received the item today 00th @ 00 . 00am xd - speedy delivery service from abroad !!.
0	0rd good point : item delivered as_described excellent condition .
0	overall : add coolshop to your list of retailers to buy from , speedy delivery , cheap prices , items as_described .
0	can '_t get better .
0	making my next preorder soon if they have resi evil : 0 .
0	coolshop are colossal !
0	from : one happy customer !
0	- dean .
0	great quality products .
0	next_day delivery failed ( order at 0 . 00pm , waited in all next_day , cam day after !!
0	).
0	when arrived wrong hinges in box although invoice said correct , have returned for refund .
0	blurb , is the market_leader by a country_mile !!
0	when sinead o ' connor first sang her hit song she could not have known then that she was singing about blurb !!
0	the quality is off the shelf , bookstore stuff , i love making books and wish i had time to take more photos so i could make more books , it is addicitve .
0	i have tried other_companies in the early days and they are amature to blurb .
0	never going to leave !
0	how anyone does not give them 0 * / or a 00 i do not know .
0	bought 0 products with next_day delivery , both were faulty .
0	no replacement offered just store credit , i complained about having to pay delivery charge again and asked that my original delivery charge be refunded as i did not get a working product next_day .
0	i was fobbed_off and ignored until i was contacted by the customer service manager who told me they had processed a refund of the cost of the parts with no mention of the cost of the delivery charge or the cost to return the 0 parts , now they are ignoring my emails .
0	i have nothing to show for my order and its cost me money .
0	worst customer service ever do not use cos if they mess up your order it will cost you to fix .
0	yodel has no_problems leaving packages in my back garden when no one is at home , which is usually the case .
0	this was very welcome until they left a large item they damaged in transit that way .
0	the damage was * very * visible , and yet they left it instead of taking it back .
0	what '_s worse , they failed to pick it up afterwards , twice !
0	i complained via a form on their website but never_heard back from them .
0	bought several items from them without problems .
0	used collect_+ whenever it was available and found it very convenient .
0	where it '_s not available , very uses_yodel for deliveries .
0	yodel always leaves my packages in my back garden when i am not at home , which was very welcome , until they left a large item they damaged in transit .
0	the item was a set of window blinds plus a metal rail something like 0 . 0 meters long .
0	in transit , the rail bent and its thick_cardboard shell was literally ripped apart at a point of impact .
0	so , the damage was * very * visible , yet they left it in my garden in my absence , instead of taking it back .
0	i explained the situation to very , attaching pictures of the damage , and asked if it '_s possible to send me just a replacement rail , as a rail itself isn_'_t that expensive , according to argos .
0	they replied it '_s not possible and i will have to send the whole_thing back .
0	i arranged a pick_up date and gave the instructions to pick it up from the back garden , as i wasn_'_t going to take a day off work , given a day of my time is more_expensive than the item they damaged .
0	i also had to patch up the packaging , as bits would literally fall through the hole at the impact zone .
0	guess_what ?
0	they failed to pick it up !
0	apparently my back garden is fine to leave a damaged item at , but not fine to pick it up from .
0	i wrote back to very customer service and got a call back from a polite lady_who_apologised for the inconvenience , but the only thing she could offer was to arrange another pick_up .
0	i mentioned i didn_'_t believe yodel would pick it up this time , but agreed .
0	needless to say i was right - they failed to do so again .
0	i wrote back to very customer service , but this time only got a generic " canned " response , suggesting me to arrange another pick_up .
0	at this point i '_ve given up trying to return the item or get a refund .
0	i will buy a replacement rail from argos and avoid both very and yodel like plague .
0	ordered a washing_machine from them , as i really needed it next_day .
0	delivered as promised , so_far so good .
0	however , somewhere between the order and delivery i got a phone_call from them where they started by confirming my delivery details and then_proceeded pushing me for an extended protection scheme with monthly_payments .
0	i don_'_t know why i agreed - i must be slow thinking over the phone .
0	got the papers today , did some calculations , and was shocked by how much of a rip_off it was !
0	by the end of my 0 year normal warranty , i would have already paid a third of the appliance '_s cost !
0	cancelled the policy immediately , without paying anything .
0	but hell , they knew pretty well it was a rip_off when they pushed me for it !
0	therefore , 0_stars .
0	if they try to bug me further , even calling to apologize , an additional star will go for each call ...
0	ordered a pair of wayfarers last summer and got them next_day .
0	even got a text to say they were on the way .
0	too bad i lost them in the sea !
0	i will be ordering again from red_hot sunglasses this year
0	having found a fault with my squash_racket , i was quick to get in touch with pdhsports for help with a repair or replacement .
0	the racket was a gift so i thought it might be difficult to authenticate my request , with no order number to supply or date of purchase .
0	they were quick to reply to emails and arranged a replacement racket to be sent as soon as possible .
0	very thankful for their service and would recommend them to anyone .
0	bought a set of knives .
0	they arrived extremely quickly and are of a high_quality .
0	very happy and will be using the site again .
0	i hear numerous horror_stories_about other_companies where you send off the product for them to rip into it and grade it .
0	the price they display is never what you actually get .
0	however with mazuma as long as the product matches the clear to see requirements the price you are quoted is the price you get .
0	i '_ve sent numerous phones and always get what i '_m quoted .
0	this is a great service from a lender in my opinion , applied for the loan on the monday_evening and money was in the bank the following evening .
0	had the loan over 00 months which makes the interest fairly low considering my credit_file .
0	i tried a different cd_key website which caused me problems due to asking for photo_id and such when i had paid through a verified paypal_account !
0	here i had no such problems , everything was pretty_much immediate and i would definitely buy from here again , no question !
0	ordering is simple , great selection , fast shipping .
0	lots of free_samples as well .
0	i '_ve bought from rcgeeks on a few occasions and can_honestly_say it was the best service i have ever received ..
0	always willing to help , in touch with me via_email throughout the order giving advice with anything i needed .
0	next_day delivery that actually arrived next_day .
0	couldn_'_t rate them highly_enough .
0	have used aria for several bits over the last_year or so and have no_complaints , they usually have good deals on that include free delivery which is handy if you ’ re in no rush to buy parts .
0	have used their rma system to return a steelseries mouse that developed a double click issue after a month of use , system was very smooth and they kept me updated along the way and a replacement mouse was sent out quickly .
0	i have used networking_store on many occasions and every time they have always delivered a great service .
0	always the cheapest prices , next_day shipping and a friendly service they are always my first stop for networking equipment .
0	i was looking for a printer that was economical to run without a high upfront cost .
0	printer lands website enabled_me to view all the units within my budget and their friendly sales staff were able to help me calculate the cost per print so that i knew_exactly how much it would cost to run
0	after the placed the order online i received the unit next_day in less_than 00_hours .
0	i had a good shop around first and could not find anyone selling the same printers cheaper .
0	i would highly_recommend printer land to anyone who_likes a good deal and great service and will_defiantly be using them again in the future .
0	shop_here its way better then everywhere_else
0	my first experience with wimdu was when my family organised a surprise birthday weekend in paris .
0	we stayed in what can only be described as a millionaires apartment for a long weekend , right in the centre of paris , for less_than a hotel .
0	perfect !
0	after this experience , i decided to try it myself and book a private room in london , this worked out equally well .
0	hotels in london can be cheap on friday / saturday , but are a rip - off mid - week to take_advantage of traveling businessmen .
0	wimdu allows me to book a room or apartment for considerably_less_than any hotel in central_london .
0	i '_ll never book another hotel in london again .
0	simple .
0	we used so - called stress_free parking at luton_airport at the end of november_0000 and will never be using it again and would like to warn other_travellers of our experience of having to wait 00_minutes for our car to be returned to us on our return on 0st december_0000 .
0	it was a quiet time to be travelling , the weather was absolutely fine and our plane landed on time at around 00 . 00 .
0	when we phoned to say we were ready to collect the car we were told it would be a 00 to 00 minute wait as a couple of planes had landed at the same time (!!)
0	- hardly a rare event !
0	after 00_minutes we called again to be told we would have to wait another 00_minutes as they had 00 cars to return - again hardly unforeseen as they have the information about when their clients are due to return when the booking is made , and they then said for the first time that a problem with the barrier was delaying them which we found somewhat hard to believe as it had not been mentioned the first time we rang .
0	we eventually got our car back at 00 . 00 , 00_minutes after our first call .
0	it would have been much_quicker to use one of the other airport car_parks with buses that run regularly and frequently .
0	we complained about our experience to stress_free customer_services and asked for compensation .
0	we were offered 00_%_off our next booking but as we shall never use this company again that was useless and they would not give us any other form of compensation and even started to question what we were saying about how long we had waited when i had sent them a screen_shot of the call logs .
0	just be aware that you may have to wait 00_minutes on your return for your car
0	fantastic site , and some of the best value ecigs and mods on the web .
0	check out the news and clearance sections .
0	i found the evic kit price impossible to resist , fantastic product at a price that is very hard to beat !!
0	!
0	excellent value , quick delivery and a vast_range of e_cig products , informative and clear , what more can i say ?
0	great experience shopping with them .
0	rob
0	i probably could have got more money by selling the phones on ebay , but then i would have had to go to post_office to send phones out , plus all the hassle of non paying bidders etc , so in actual fact when you consider the ebay fees and hassle , mazuma was probably a better option .
0	the whole_process was easy , straight_forward and hassle_free .
0	highly_recommended and would definately_use again in the future .
0	before i bought from cyberpower i had read many , many bad_reviews and ratings about them , but i soon learnt that that was for the us company : upon visiting cyberpower uk '_s website ( site in question ) i learnt the truth .
0	awards as soon as you take a look at the index page : testimonials , and quite a lot of them to your right .
0	what could be wrong about this company ?
0	after taking a few fiddles - with the ' configuration ', which i found extremely easy and fun to use , giving a real - time price with every variable .
0	it had everything , from entry - level graphics , to the powerful gtx_000 and ati 0000 , a wide arrange of processors and cases , a varied amount of psu brans , ram , cd drives , hdd ....
0	i think you get my drift .
0	so , after poking around the forums , i engaged in the cyberpower - feel and looked at the customer feedback : which nearly all was good , and if it wasn_'_t , there was a suitable response given and an offer to help that person with their negative situation .
0	and so , after saving about 00 configurations ( no joke ) i placed my order , but not without luke '_s and other moderators on the forums help and assistance .
0	and so , i placed my order , got a 0 %_discount and freebies ( amazing !)
0	and the pc construction was complete !
0	regarding the order , it was built on time : dispatched on time , all with the exception of my zalman monitor , which was put down to weather and transport difficulties in the south : which is perfectly_acceptable given that the snow these past few_days has_been catastrophic globally .
0	and , if you see that as motive not to shop at cyberpower : think again !
0	i was then offered a 00 " viewsonic monitor , a size upgrade to my pre_- ordered 00 " zalman .
0	but nay , i really wanted a 0d - experience , so i '_ll hang out for a couple of days !
0	all in all : i '_ll definitely be using cyberpower for the future , and have already_recommended it to numerous friends : one of which has bought one already : and his experience was also flawless .
0	seriously : if you want good customer service , technical help , fair prices and an enjoyable_experience : cyberpower is the place to go !
0	eagarly awaited the delivery to try this food , unfortunately i found the curry to be very watery & no flavour .
0	very disappointed to be honest , i ordered having heard good reviews but for me it just isn_'_t good enough .
0	got a mobile to sell ?
0	cant recommend mazumba enough , easy process and got paid the day the phones were received .
0	they do what they say , what more do you want ?
0	00 / 00
0	i had almost lost_faith in software that claims to tune up your pc but i can highly_recommend this software , been using for a couple of years and its stable , updates properly and does what it says on the tin .
0	i have just got the new 0000 and it has_improved even more .
0	good work people , please keep_up the good work !!!
0	00 / 00 cheers
0	the course is excellent , well_structured and detailed .
0	the tutors are very supportive .
0	online learning is an excellent way to work towards qualifications , gain knowldege and competencies .
0	i have enrolled on two courses and they are both excellent .
0	i have been an urban_industry customer for over a year now and have never been let_down with the service i have recieved .
0	the product information is always on point and products arrive as_described in good time and well_packaged .
0	always happy to do repeat buisiness .
0	the decision and ordering_process was made really simple !
0	hard to go_wrong really !
0	will_definitely use iflorist again !
0	i '_ve bought web master package and it seems to be quite promising .
0	pretty easy to use .
0	thankfully , i didn_'_t face any problem while buying the course .
0	i compared this deal with many others and found it the most affordable .
0	the package consists of all that is mentioned on their website .
0	brilliant !
0	delivery was on time , the service was great i '_m really happy with my purchase loved the site as it was really easy to navigate il be ordering from wheelspin again .
0	thanks guys .
0	this was only based on a simple mot .
0	i have a friend locally who is a mechanic and does all the work on my car so knew that it would pass without_any_issues .
0	i '_m not sure i would be prepared to have my car serviced through them though based on previous reviews , though this will all come down to the garage doing the work on their behalf and i think on this occasion i got lucky .
0	i don_'_t make a habit of dishing out bad_reviews but thought in this instance , it was required ....
0	ordered with next_day delivery on 0 / 00 and nothing arrived by 0 / 00 .
0	i was informed that it had been dispatched and i ' d receive my item within 0 - 0 days ..... still nothing on the 00th .
0	at this point my protein were no_longer returning my emails and on the 00rd i decided to cancel my order ( having to wait 00mins in a telephone queue ).
0	on the 00th i received a phone_call from one of my protein '_s customer service agents apologising for what had happened and i was offered a discount for my next purchase which would be emailed to me .
0	00 days_later and i '_m still_waiting for my voucher and again after mailing them i have not received a response .
0	absolutely_shocking customer service .
0	at first i put it down to the courier company being at fault , but apparently a change in their systems was to blame .
0	this i could understand , but it is unacceptable to make false_promises , leave customers waiting for long_periods in a telephone queue and not respond to numerous mails .... and then fail to send a discount when offered !!
0	!
0	like many others i will never again order from my protein .
0	do not use this company .
0	they may seem like the cheaper option but they are extremely ruthless when it comes to penalty charges which are ludicrous !
0	i was charged £_000 in one month for using my limit of data and they didn_'_t once think to tell me these charges were taking place .
0	they cut me off and refused to re - connect until i paid them .
0	i refused and now they are trying to claim £_000 through a debt_collection_agency .
0	this all could have been avoided with some good communication .
0	avoid
0	very impressed with the whole_experience .
0	would handle a problem with the delivery , which ensured i received the package .
0	the only issue is that they only use one delivery company ( city - link ) who only use an_automated service for re - delivery and could not specify a more accurate_eta .
0	would definitely shop again .
0	i have been with o0 for a number of years , around about 00 i would say .
0	i am on a very low monthly_tariff which suits my needs perfectly and have a very up to date phone .
0	they offer early upgrades and usually have the latest handsets .
0	when , and usually before the contract_expires , a free upgrade is offered .
0	both the o0 store and o0 online have very good deals with extremely competitive_prices .
0	their latest advantage is offering customers home broadband for a very good price , with the cheapest line installation around .
0	however , one disadvantage is that although they try to keep existing_customers , they no_longer break their backs to do so and will not back down even over a small_amount meaning they are no_longer benefiting their existing_customers , who may now decide to leave .
0	goods ordered on 00th_august_0000 .
0	received on 00th_september , taking a total of 00 days to arrive .
0	on arrival , model did not match picture shown on web_site .
0	customers buying online are entitled to a 0 day cooling_off period , where a full_refund must be provided .
0	on reporting this issue , i was told i had to pay a 00_% charge ( approx_£_00 ) making it a total_waste of money to return .
0	on speaking to the manager i was told i would have to pay £_00 just to return it .
0	do not touch with a bargepole
0	i don_'_t normally leave reviews for anything but this was by far the best massage i '_ve had ..
0	very good , super - fast delivery and a large_selection of stock
0	fantastic company super cheap , just the right nets that i wanted will_deff buy again !
0	there fantastic !
0	buy from them you wont be disappointed !
0	great company , had no_problems easy to order massive_selection of glasses to choose from , sent the next_day via_ups .
0	totally awful company , brought a 00 " hd plasma from them at a cost of £_000 , they promised me delivery between_0am and 00am , after 0pm i got worried so i rung them .... 0 times in total though out the day for it finally be delivered at 00 . 00pm !!!!
0	worst company ever !
0	i will never be buying from this bunch again ....
0	i think it was very easy to use the site and buy things on the website , the delivery was very fast and i was very happy with the items .
0	i would always use this site again .
0	preferect transaction and a god price .
0	purchased and communication was excellent and the item arrived extreamly quickly .
0	they are now saved on my favorite list .
0	ordered tickets for cheryl cole & they came very fast & a lot of other_companies add on extras like commission etc at the end but with double 0 its in the total price so you know what your paying !
0	would def_use again :-)
0	thank_you

0	as i was not able to go through the antifraud process with my phone , the procedure was a bit longer ( photo of id card and credit_card ), and i had to remind the site of this , but i have been answered very quickly .
0	the antifraud process , even contraignant , is a mark of an efficient and serious service , and the prices are very attractive .
0	i would strongly_recommend this website for these reasons ( but be sure that your phone number works if you don_'_t want to lose some time ^^).
0	i am absolutely livid about the delivery practices of yodel .
0	yesterday yodel knocked on my door and i walked downstairs only to find a note already slipped in my door .
0	i don_'_t live in a huge mansion , so it took less_than 00 seconds for me to get downstairs .
0	i was godsmacked .
0	today i was ready for the race and the second the door was knocked on i literally ran down the stairs to catch the delivery .
0	as you probably guessed , the delivery guy was no where in sight and there was another card in my door .
0	seriously it took maybe 00 - 00 seconds , but more realistically probably only about 0 .
0	so i can only_assume the deliver person slipped the card into my door , then knocked , and left .
0	i am amazed_how lazy these_people are .
0	first off i notice they avoid ringing the doorbell .
0	this is most_likely done in hopes they don_'_t alert anyone to the fact they are there .
0	secondly they leave immediately after they knock .
0	they must have the card already filled out prior to coming to the door because it would be impossible to write out the card in the time it took me to run down my stairs .
0	lastly , good luck calling customer service to complain .
0	the only number on the card is to reschedule or pick_up your package .
0	i paid to have my package delivered , not drive across town to pick it up .
0	i will never_knowingly use any company that works with this " delivery " company .
0	this was my first time using the fx_firm , and i can '_t express how pleased i have been with them .
0	the communication from_start to finish has_been phenomenal .
0	i initially was planning to use a larger , more well know fx company , and after countless issues setting_up an account , multiple_times calling only to be placed on hold , being told someone would call me back only to wait and find out it was a lie , i gave up and started to research further .
0	i found the fx_firm , and although they only had a limited number of reviews , they were all positive .
0	not only were the reviews positive , but they also provided the best exchange_rate .
0	i just completed my first transaction with them and will not_hesitate to continue to use them .
0	sam bennett , owain walters , and jane burn were fantastic in answering my questions , and dealing_with my initial concerns .
0	the communication and promptness of this company could not have been better .
0	thank_you .
0	not a chance i would shop anywhere_else !
0	you can '_t match supplementwarehouse '_s prices !
0	i was thoroughly impressed with the service and more specifically the speed of which i recieved my order .
0	i placed the order at 0 . 00pm on the thursday and it was delivered on 00 . 00am the next_day .
0	i '_ve experienced problems before with one particular net based company , so i am always wary .
0	but i wouldn_'_t hesitate to use this place again .
0	a week and 0 days_later my product still never came , i payed for postage and it hasn_'_t arrived !
0	disapointed
0	probably the best uk job search_engine out there .
0	i '_ve had a couple of orders of montana gold paint from graff - city and every_aspect of my transactions were spot on .
0	firstly the site .
0	the look of the site is very sleek whilst managing to have a layout that is clear , simple and very user_friendly .
0	the price of the items that i have ordered is the best i can find online and their " freebies " section allows you to add one free_gift with qualifying orders .
0	i '_ve had two mixed bags of spray caps now for nothing :) the postage_costs are really reasonable which is something that can be a sting in the tail when ordering online .
0	the despatch time is amazing , on both my orders they were despatched within about an_hour of the order being placed .
0	their points reward_system is pretty generous too !
0	for the orders i have placed , ups was the chosen carrier and they provide tracking_info too .
0	as i said at the start , every_step of the transactions was spot on !
0	i can '_t recommend this company highly_enough !
0	i '_ve_used loads of different online bookies over the years and skybet is the only one i '_ve stuck with for a long period of time and used regularly .
0	never had any_problems with anything and any time i '_ve had to get in touch with customer_services i '_ve been sorted_out straight_away .
0	can '_t see me leaving skybet for a rival bookie any time soon .
0	their products are well made , while being of a cost level that anyone from amatur to profession can use , with the feel of a secure , professional product that will not fail you or your expensive equipment
0	i decided to ' bite - the - bullet ' and get a canon_0d , for at_least £_000 cheaper_than a uk version but still with a 0 year_warranty ( albeit via digitalrev rather_than canon ).
0	the alternative was a 000d ... but in my opinion 0d > 000d although based on much older technology .
0	checked out the feedback on the website from other customers and went forward with the purchase .
0	waited for the item to arrive with baited_breath ...
0	delivery was tracked throughout , prompt and arrived on specified day with sms_updates .
0	item was wrapped in maybe 0 - 0ft of bubble_wrap - and nestled safely was the canon_0d box plus a few extras i ordered .
0	so_far i have not had any_problems , i am only just starting in the world of enthusiast photography - i am no expert .
0	my only_gripe , ( and it is a minor one ); all the documentation was in japanese - not a big deal since the english pdf can be downloaded from canon '_s website .
0	but when your just starting and a solid bit of kit arrives with a bible - sized manual that makes no sense to you the reader , it can feel intimidating .
0	to date not had any_issues or problems , so i am unable to comment on digitalrev aftersales / support .
0	i have no_regrets following this purchase and i am very pleased with the product and service from digitalrev .
0	now , photography community what '_s all this rumour nonsense about a 0d mk0 and where can i get one ??
0	?
0	the problem came after i decided i needed to return the jeans on the day i received them , after i posted them back they never refunded me .
0	i paid on paypal and and could not set_up a dispute as i waited too long for promised refunds which never happened ...
0	be careful dealing_with this company
0	i flew for manchester uk to nyc .

0	the price was good and very competitive .
0	let_down at first in regards to having to pay for delivery for a standard game that cost me £_00 .
0	a quick phone_call sorted me out though , after_speaking to a very friendly and helpful representative in the call_centre i was informed this charge was incorrect and reimbursed .
0	the one downside i had to my purchase was gameseek '_s choice of delivery partner .
0	unfortunately gameseek use royal_mail who are notoriously terrible in my area , and took 0 days to deliver the item .
0	but i understand the late delivery is no fault of their own .
0	will use again in the future .
0	i just hope that you will consider a better courier .
0	chemical - records is a great music store with a cheap delivery over the world .

0	saved_myself a total of £_00 . 00 for the same hostel , same dates , same dorm capacity just by using hostelbookers instead of hostelworld ,

0	booked through chilli sause , had a great experience .
0	communication was fantastic .
0	prices very reasonable compared to other_companies .
0	their website is really simple and not cluttered like some others couldnt_fault them at all .
0	exactly_what it says on the tin
0	smart it support was a great partner at my previous company .
0	upon starting elanguage , i looked for a professional software_development partner to work with us on some of our products ; the choice was simple .
0	they have the people and the expertise to consistently deliver a quality product .
0	they show a great commitment to customer_satisfaction and it is a pleasure to work with them

0	i ordered a £_00 flower_arrangement and paid extra to have them delivered on mothers_day .
0	they '_ve taken the money but no flowers have arrived .
0	i called the number from the website which now says they are no_longer taking calls on the number and recently noticed the number has disappeared from the website .
0	what an awful company .
0	they never made it clear that i could not use this without a vpn .
0	as normal you guys just use vpn to download then switch to normal again .
0	fantastic products , great service would deffo_use again !
0	!
0	ordered a longines conquest sport from iconic_watches and very happy with the product , service and discount .
0	will_defiantly use them again .
0	only wish i had found them before i bought my omeag seamaster aqua terra !
0	fast delivery , competitive_prices , and customer reward_scheme to keep loyal_customers going back .
0	after keying all payment details when booking flights got a processing transaction message for two minutes followed_by an error_message .
0	had to ring company ( phone picked_up quickly by staff ) to find out payment not processed .
0	they sent email with a link to sagepay to pay for flights .
0	as other users have mentioned you need to have some confidence in a site especially when paying quite a lot of money for flights and unfortunately this site did not provide that .
0	you need to seriously look at improving the payment process as i '_m_sure its crucial to your customers , as well as your company .
0	also - just realised , after spending some time on the internet and booking through this company , money is taken straight_away , but tickets not issued until 00hrs_later , and there is no guarantee you will get the tickets at prices quoted ( see their terms and conditions ) so there is a chance you dont get tickets at all .
0	if you dont want hassle and peace of mind , book with someone_else and pay that little extra .
0	ordered phone on 00th_august which was in stock on web , out of stock after ordering .
0	spoke to ' steve ' from customer_services told_him to cancel order over phone .

0	great communication as well .
0	just order from heinnie_haynes
0	this site is simply awesome .
0	the games are aost half the price than other_retailers what can go_wrong .

0	i order products of scan . co . uk and dpd is their man courier .

0	around half 00 my parcel arrived what more can i say !
0	perfect_timing !
0	arrived within two_days , despite it being after the christmas last - delivery date .
0	i '_ve bought both big and small items from merlin , ranging_from some inner_tubes to a frameset .
0	each time , the price has_been great and shipping almost unbelievably_fast .
0	when i '_ve had occasion to speak to them on the phone , they '_ve been friendly and efficient .
0	i use orbitremit every_month and have never had a problem getting funds through in good time .
0	the rates are good even with no fees .
0	i have never_experienced any major problems when using the p0g service either nationally or internationally .
0	i had a small blip this morning , when i could not see or access a customers order for the paperwork i needed .
0	after about 0 minutes with a very pleasant operator named ashley t , i had the paperwork emailed to me and the order was ready for dispatch .
0	thank_you ashley for a quick , easy and pleasant resolution to my problem
0	i was in desperate_need of a worktop before_christmas .
0	my problem was time , being available for delivery , not having much money and being a fussy b * stard !
0	- the worktop was the cheapest " proper " one i could_find
0	- the 0 man delivery meant my wife could take delivery ...
0	- after a 00 min notice courtesy_call
0	- the quality of the worktop is spot on
0	- the wide width wasavailable from stock
0	- driver was friendly and helpful
0	if i had to find fault , the order didn_'_t go through correctly online but the lady on the phone sorted this straight_away and advised me on the best delivery option .
0	would recommend !
0	thank_you for helping_me sort our trip to cyprus with this easter !
0	searching for the right place was easy and hassle_free leaving more time to plan what we will be doing whilst there - this will also be easier as our accomodation is in such a good location !
0	top website , will be using again
0	i found the website very intuitive - you can see as much information as you want all on the homepage , without having to click away to other pages ( and wait for them to load ).
0	it has current_trends so you can see straight_away what is popular , and is very simply laid_out , making it clear who their partners are , so it is not hidden away at the bottom of the site map .
0	it is also very easy to save / share a page , which is very useful as most couples looking at holidays will be doing it separately at their respective desks .
0	it also has great social_media integration so you can boast about where you have just booked up for next year !
0	just one of my fav online stores .
0	google now is one of the most_popular_brands in the world .
0	very reliable search_engine ... and also does other thing like the operation system android , google_maps and so on .... but i remember my lecturer said once that if you are not focust in a particular area sooner or later you fail .
0	time will tell ...
0	it is really good experience using easyjet .
0	i am flying with this company 0 - 0 times a year myself and also buying tickets for my family and friends .
0	they are providing reasonable prices and good services .
0	the only disadvantage that comes to my mind now is the long waiting time for the gate number to appear on the information screens and after that before getting into the plane .
0	it always takes more time than it should .
0	in general low - cost carrier that i would recommend .
0	so , the laptop is really great as_described .
0	it arriver for 0 working_days .
0	i received a few confirmation massages for the payment , the day when is going to arrive and also the time which was quite impressive .
0	i am really satisfied with the service and would recommend the website .
0	there is only one disadvantage that on the very far top left corner of the screen there is a death pixel in red colour which is not a dig deal for me .
0	i believe that i received a great value for my money .
0	a friend recommended me to this site & i must_say im impressed with the savings ive made & my house sold quickly great value will use again .
0	when i search for flights through kayak i '_m usually linked to ebookers with the cheapest offers .
0	the site is easy to use and stores all your flights / activity past and present .
0	nothing to complain_about .
0	my glasses were really well_packaged and the free next_day delivery is bonus !
0	thanks
0	i '_ve_used supplement_warehouse for a few_years_now for all my supplemental / nutritional_needs .
0	they offer a wide_variety of brands and products .
0	they even take 0 %_off an item if you find it cheaper on another website !
0	you can '_t beat that , so give it a shot and see if they have the supplements you take .... which they will
0	the information available about my headphones , the updates i received about my order and the speed with which it arrived all mean i ' d be very happy using this company again .
0	in a nutshell i found some ink for my printer on their site , it was very cheap so i took a punt and ordered it .
0	the ink arrived next_day for no extra_cost and it has_been printing flawlessly for the last two week .
0	can '_t get much_better_than that .
0	i have been using ebuyer since july_0000 and have to say they are still my favourite online supplier of technical products .
0	they have a great range of products , quick , easy delivery and good customer service ( although i rarely use it !).
0	as with every company , i have had the odd one or two items that needed returning but in 0 years i can '_t ever remember a time where they have not dealt_with my orders or returns with anything other than quick , professional service .
0	thank_you ebuyer .
0	i have hired various vehicles from kendalls in guildford and they have always been very friendly and welcoming .
0	their prices seem to be the best in the area and unlike many other_companies they include_vat and insurances in the quote so there were no_hidden_costs .
0	would highly_recommend .
0	we accidently found this little cafe on our way down to cornwall and had the most pleasant lunch .
0	beautiful barn , great food and wonderful service - it is now definitely our place to stop by choice whenever we make that journey .
0	highly_recommend .
0	great prices for great products
0	i called to check if they had a nokia_e00 in stock before ordering .
0	i was told yes , and ordered it immediately before 0pm and paid for next_day special delivery .
0	after 0pm the following_day i called to ask why i hadnt received the phone and was told i ordered late , which i know i didnt , and that the phone would be sent out the following_day .
0	the following_day , the phone was not delivered and when i called to enquire why , i was this time informed the batch they had had failed testing and it would be anther couple of days before i would receive the phone .
0	i explained i was travelling hence_why i ordered for next_day delivery .
0	i was offered an accessory_pack and a refund on my special delivery charge and assured i would receive the phone after 0 days and the manager would call to confirm despatch .
0	i did not receive a call .
0	however when i have received the phone 0 days_later than_expected , the phone was in relative good condition , with a very old battery and to make_matters_worse the wrong nokia charger .
0	the big style rather_than thin pin charger was sent making me question the quality of their checks before despatch .
0	also no accessory_pack was sent .
0	i ordered a new battery and charger from ebay for a fiver , delivered without problems .
0	will not be ordering from refurb again .
0	the communication_regarding the despatch and delivery of my parcel was great .
0	i knew where it was at all_stages and i knew when it was going to be delivered .
0	it came next_day as i requested and it was really in - expensive in comparison to most other couriers , especially next_day couriers .
0	i would recommend yodel again and again .
0	good place to shop
0	the best place for ur tikets
0	dont like it it sucks
0	i love dell
0	now i relly love there pizza
0	i love there phones

0	i booked my summer_holiday through away 0 and could not recommend them more !
0	the holiday was for me and my girlfriend and from the start we where unsure of where to go .
0	the staff at away 0 made numerous suggestions of locations specific to our needs and was able to quote us prices on a range of hotels and all where competitive .
0	we changed locations a number of times and away 0 was always understanding and where more than happy to get us another quote and make suggestions of other hotels that may suit as best .
0	booking the package through them has saved me a lot of time and hassle as well .
0	live_chat very helpful and delivered next_day on a saturday for free .
0	nice job
0	customer service is what seperates this place from the rest .
0	got a call immediately after_placing the order to inform_me item was not in stock .
0	if that wasn_'_t enough , they also emailed me just to make_sure !
0	offered a suitable_alternative , which worked out to be slightly more dearer but they gave it to me for the same price as my original order .
0	granted , it was only £ 0 . 00 , but who does that ?!
0	got the tap within 0 days !
0	awesome !
0	food was in poor condition !
0	stick to purchasing in store !
0	big_mistake !
0	travelled first_class , love the amount of room provided and the unlimited food and drinks available throughout the flight .
0	stewardesses and stewards were very attentive and the seat was very extremely comfortable .
0	a really easy was of organising everything and really helped think of events we would never have considered .
0	brilliant help from the staff and def recomend people to use a company like chillisauce to take the stress away
0	really good easy to use fast just what i wanted will_defo_use again a *
0	i '_ve bought thousands of pounds worth of musical_equipment from gak over the past decade or so , and never had a problem with a single item .
0	not only that , but their staff are some of the most helpful , and well informed i '_ve spoken to .
0	as reviews have said before , since using musclefood . com , i will never buy meat from the supermarket again .
0	high_quality , well_packaged foods at low_prices .
0	their service is especially good for any person_who_wants to look after their body and knows what nutrients that requires .
0	i only hope business for this exemplary company goes from strength to strength .
0	great prices for a wide_variety of quality products , and delivery is always prompt .
0	after using one or two other_companies , i ' d wholeheartedly_recommend them in a jiffy .
0	customer service is excellent , and free_gifts are regularly thrown in .
0	superb .
0	the diet_whey blends well , and tastes great ( choc_mint ) it fills you up and works as a great pre / post_workout supplement or meal replacement .
0	i recently_bought a pair of oakley gascan sunglasses and not only is the product fantastic , a snug_fit not tight , perfect_condition etc .

0	normally i '_m unsure_about non - mainstream online shops but there is no need to doubt this company , 000_% genuine .
0	great prices , first_class phone comms .
0	what more can you want ?
0	i '_ll will_definetly be back for more purchases !
0	:)
0	finding myself short of money recently , i decided to sell a pair of old_htc_desire hds that i had lying about .
0	as they were both in full working condition , complete , and devoid of any scratches , i was confident that i ' d receive the full_amount offered - £_00 . 00 each .
0	i wrapped them both thoroughly in bubble_wrap and stuck them in the envelope provided , before sending them via_recorded delivery .
0	a couple of days_later , i was very surprised to receive a message_saying that they ' d tested the phones and discovered that the back cover of one of them was missing , and that i ' d have to accept a £_00 deduction for this .
0	i chose not to accept nor decline the offer at this point , as i ' d already paid £ 0 for delivery and would have been charged a further £ 0 - 00 for the phones to be returned to me , one of which would now be missing its back cover .
0	instead , i sent an email querying the missing cover , explaining that they must have mislaid it whilst unpacking or testing the phone .
0	after several days with no response , i sent the same email again , to which they replied claiming to have " placed an investigation " into what i ' d said , and that they were " getting together " the results of this .
0	two_days_later they debited £_000 . 00 to my bank_account - £_00 less_than the amount i was supposed to receive .
0	i '_ve sent another email asking about this but it '_s been a week and i '_ve still received nothing .
0	=== update ===
0	thanks for the response .
0	there is absolutely no way that i mislaid the cover prior to sending .
0	before packaging the phones , i removed the back covers of both in order to remove the sim and memory_cards and replaced the covers immediately afterwards .
0	i definitely would have noticed if either cover had been missing it when i was wrapping the phones in bubble_wrap .
0	what i suspect must have occurred is that the cover came loose as you removed the phone from its bubble_wrap , and that the cover was then discarded along with the bubble_wrap .
0	my method of wrapping - which i suspect is quite common - was to encase each phone in several_layers of bubble_wrap by passing a strip of it laterally around the phone , taping it up tight , and finally taping the top and bottom ends to form a parcel .
0	given that the back cover of the htc_desire_hd is removed by sliding it downwards , it would be quite easy for it to be pulled off the phone if the top of the bubble_wrap parcel was cut open and the phone pulled_out - rather_than removing all of the tape and unravelling the packaging .
0	i appreciate that data_protection and privacy is an issue when checking cctv_footage , but would it be possible for you to confirm that the cover was not discarded along with the bubble_wrap as in the above scenario ?
0	furthermore , your response does not address why the payment went_ahead without my permission .
0	your email states : " if no response is received within 0 days , bozowi will automatically process payment for the specified downgraded amount ."
0	given that i responded via_email twice within the 0 day period to raise my objection to the downgraded offer , the payment should not have been automatically processed .
0	despite the fact that i sent my phone off a bit late , and that it had some minor_scratches on the screen , mazuma still paid me very promptly in full .
0	you ' d be hard_pressed to find similar service elsewhere .
0	the mazuma website was easy to navigate - explained everything that was going to happen and even showed me how to clear all personal info from my old phone .
0	the transaction was fast , with the pre_- paid post bag supplied making everything trouble_free .
0	money was in the bank fast - couldn_'_t be_happier !
0	i don_'_t order from anywhere_else .
0	with the price matcher and selection of products i can always get what i need without_breaking the bank .
0	my first time ordering i placed my order on a friday_morning and had my order by saturday_afternoon .
0	i would definitely recommend this site to anyone !
0	ordered my first item , a set of ski - poles , from facewest after waiting for them to come_back into stock .
0	my package arrived very quickly and well - packaged .
0	absolutely_faultless and would definitely use again and recommend .
0	i bought a phone and 00qiud credit .
0	i haven_'_t got 00 pound more than 0 months and i haven_'_t got the refund ...
0	came 0 times to the shop , 0 times called but no sort it out ...
0	rubbish provider ..
0	i got this company from the internet and then i just topped_up £_00 .
0	my o0 balance was deducted £_00 but i couldn_'_t receive my balance on topupnow . co . uk .
0	my balance still £ 0
0	i have tried for contacting the customer service but they didnt do any help .
0	i still lost my money .
0	:-( :-( :-(
0	so avoid the company .
0	fast delivery , great customer service .
0	bought a bud ego starter and a month later one of the batteries stopped charging , dropped them an email and within an_hour i got a response telling_me to return it for a new one , cannot_fault them !
0	had an issue with double charged items and the customer_support helped_me quickly and efficiently , a + for that , also pre_- ordered call of duty mw 0 and came day early !!!
0	best online shopping since e_- bay ;)
0	my phone was 0 months old and worked_perfectly .
0	i sent it to mazuma in a bubble_wrapped envelope , inside the normal postal envelope they send .
0	then i get an email_saying it does not charge , then try ripping me off for £_00 less_than the offer they made me .
0	bunch of con_artists i will be reporting to trading_standards .
0	i would have tried to talk to them but there lines are not open .
0	couldn_'_t be_happier with the service that aria has provided over the years , they remain_competitive with their prices and their deals , and offer all_round exceptional service .
0	they use the courier dpd which , in my opinion , is the best courier in the uk , hands_down .
0	item was dispatched very quickly and arrived next working day as due , i '_m happy to pay £ 0 . 00 shipping flat_rate for dpd over citylink ( what they used when i last purchased in 0000 ), any day !
0	well_packaged item and given that it was an external hdd , that was very important .
0	not much more to say really except thanks for the amazing service :-)
0	tpexpress wanted to charge me £_00 for a return ticket to london .
0	thetrainline only charged me £_00 , that '_s a saving of £_00 !
0	couldn_'_t be_happier !
0	amazing prices and very competitive !
0	( friendly on twitter too !)
0	:-)
0	wow , in all honesty , i wasn_'_t expecting too much .
0	i went for their free business card option where you use ' one of 00 templates ' ( there are other options too ) with a little_bit of branding text on the back and only paying £ 0 . 00 for delivery .
0	ordered wednesday_night , was despatched thursday and arrived through the letter_box on friday .
0	you simply can '_t go_wrong for the price !
0	the printing quality is great , the cards feel high_quality and even came in little plastic_boxes to make it easy to carry them round with you without them getting damaged .
0	couldn_'_t be_happier all in all :-)
0	thanks for your service !
0	when i see that a parcel i ordered has_been dispatched with dpd , i '_m almost jumping for joy !
0	every experience i have had with dpd so_far has_been a great one , and they are my preference over any other courier .
0	every time the driver has_been friendly and within the 0 hour time_slot .
0	talking of the 0 hour_timeslot , as well as the driver tracking , dpd is far ahead of competition in the courier business as far as i '_m concerned .
0	:)
0	absolutely great service game , and i couldn_'_t be more thankful !
0	a great company with a great customer_services team that handles situations really well , thanks for your services !
0	highly_recommended :)
0	p . s .
0	no , i do not ' work for them ', my personal overall experience with game has_been great .
0	no network is quite like this , the value is epic , perhaps not as good as some other_networks , but when you factor everything in ( which you will steadily learn when you join giffgaff ) it just cannot be_beaten !
0	!
0	not really much else to say , although i don_'_t agree with some peoples reviews based on my experience , it '_s nice to see a balanced opinion , and this place really works hard to fish out the fake_reviews !
0	very easy to do , looks_like a trust - able company .
0	they have the best prices i could_find for ps + codes , and had no problem in redeeming , or in getting the codes .
0	oh , and instant delivery makes it even better !
0	if you are looking for a place for your digital goods , look no further !
0	the cheapest place that i could_find ps0_games , they keep you up to date , and when you select the 0 - 0 day delivery option ... that includes delivery , which is royal_mail first_class !
0	:)
0	they offer great prices with great service , package their products well and overall the whole_experience purchasing from them ( for the first time ) has_been incredible .
0	certainly will be shopping with you again in the near_future !
0	thanks !
0	:)
0	[ edit ] second experience even better_than the first one !
0	ordered sunday_night , got an email monday 0 :_00am to say it was being dispatched , arrived today , tuesday .
0	i chose the 0 - 0 day free option too .
0	absolutely incredible !
0	:)
0	absolutely great service .
0	got key quickly through autokey , had to get an sms to confirm account to prevent fraud , however that was quick and easy .
0	everything was handled quickly and nicely !
0	:)
0	i '_ve_used ebuyer several_times and now use it for all of my tech or computer_components , prices are always competitive and delivery is top_notch .
0	i '_ve never had any_problems with their service or products .
0	i always recommend to my friends and family .
0	supplementwarehouse . com is all you need to know , everything else just a click away .
0	i always use williamhill for betting on footy games .
0	can '_t go_wrong , easy to use system and takes seconds making deposits through paypal .
0	only_downside is some betting sites give you winnings + what ever was betted , these just give you the winnings .
0	i purchased some website traffic expecting it to take days to start ( couldn_'_t find reviews ) but it came through after 00_hours .
0	very impressed so_far .
0	other online companies could_learn alot from simply_games !
0	the game was £ 0 cheaper_than many online stores .
0	ordered sunday_evening and have just received it through the post ... and free delivery !
0	the game is in mint_condition due to the excellent packaging sent in .
0	have never used your company before but i certainly will again .
0	i normally use play or amazon and wait days / weeksfor delivery , but now after getting such great service from you simply_games will get my custom from now on !
0	will be recommending you to all my friends and family .
0	was well_worth purchasing my 0d mk 0 from digital_rev as they were so much_cheaper_than the alternatives in the uk .
0	the camera came perfectly on time , but unfortunately the battery_grip i ordered was missing part .
0	however digital_rev quickly resolved this via emails and instant_chat , sending me out a replacement straight_away .
0	their customer service staff were very helpful and polite !
0	will_definitely be using them again .
0	they hold your money and final_decision my arse like i sell threw my website and have 000_% customer feedback .
0	but paypal held 0 transactions totaling over 00 , 000_gbp and still 0 years later zero money because they r not uk_based they are not under uk law so customers have protects i have no money to cover it now they keepo charging my business account the paypal business fee and virtual card but its suspended i cant close it yet they let you add funds or cards and accounts yea right this need to be stopped
0	this is an amazing place , its and great for food and drink and every_penny made her goes towards the feufield trust ( feufield animal sanctuary ) the staff here are friendly and will help you and give you a warm_welcome .
0	the cafe is on high_street in biggar and it is worth a stop on your way through even for some amazing coffee or even a superb afternoon tea or superb salmon & creme cheese begal .
0	feufield also have the animal sanctuary just outside symington lanarkshire .
0	highly_recommended place for food and a warm_welcome .
0	help them help the animals .
0	i bought 0 items through theyre ebay page , never recieved any thing they still have my money , dont answer phone , no reply to emails or complaints .
0	i had to involved police and trading_standards for defrauding customers out of money through deseptive means .
0	they know its not in stock but still take your money it takes weeks and weeks for ebay to deal with them and still many other customers each day are negitive them with exact_same problem , beware
0	i loved how much_cheaper the products were at supplementwarehouse .
0	first time purchasing anything here so we will see how everything turns_out .
0	so_far so good .
0	the only thing that i had a slight_issue with was the website .
0	just seems to me that it could be cleaned up and organized a bit better .
0	rather_than scrolling endlessly through products make it able to seperate pills from liquids to capsuls to herbs .. etc .. maybe since i used the search bar for names of products i was using was my problem idk .
0	but other than that great experience so_far .
0	company called offering me £ 0 for 0 months - i did not receive one single enquiry .
0	they automatically_renewed the subscription without an email_advising they would do so !
0	avoid at all costs they are a rip_off and produce no results
0	they obtain money by misleading promotions and then just take your money without authorization
0	luckily for me they took it from a company credit_card which requires a purchase order so i '_ve taken it up with the credit_card company
0	regardless of the specifics ... this is a very misleading ploy which relies on people not reading their emails or remembering to cancel the pending subscription .
0	the larger " proper " companies who advertise holiday_homes don_'_t employ such misleading offers and promotions , why ?
0	because they don_'_t need to .
0	the proof of their pudding is in the eating .
0	pure holiday_homes offer is just a way to tie people into a campaign with them with no success .
0	i would like to note that i ran more than one advert with them and did not receive a single enquiry in 0 months !
0	not a single one !
0	i receive 0 a day from home away holiday rentals .
0	speaking as a consumer i strongly_recommend using one of the more reputable_companies .
0	yes i am going to post on as many forums as i can find as i feel that i have been cheated into paying for a service that not only is not fit for purpose but a service that i simply do not want .
0	as usual hostelbooker was perfect .
0	the hostel we booked in , x hostel , was one of the greatest i have ever stayed in , and i '_m someone_who had 00 holidays in the last 00 months .
0	it was truly_amazing .
0	thanks :)
0	awesome place with great moneyback
0	they lose an item that is paid for on a 00 hour service and the .
0	have no customer service at all to help .
0	ordered 00 days ago and still nothing .
0	wont be using lp again .
0	utter garbage .
0	so slow to post out , delivery can take_forever .
0	and its clear i am not the only one unhappy !
0	i ordered and within 00_hours had my items .
0	all as_described and great quality .
0	viovet let_me know the stage of my order by email at every_stage .
0	i would shop again for sure !
0	cheapest , quickest , easiest and most reliable place around !
0	i will always recommend checking here first !
0	easy to use , price was better_than other_sites i searched for .
0	i would definitely use them again .
0	always receive what i order in good time .
0	had a lovely_lady on the customer service number .
0	will be using this site regularly now .
0	my delivery didn_'_t turn_up on the monday that it was due .
0	although i have asked for proof they turned_up ( they didn_'_t ring the doorbell or leave a card ), i didn_'_t ' receive any after i asked 0 times .
0	their customer service systems seem to freeze or not work a lot so when you call , you can '_t get an answer there and then even_though you have patiently_waited after calling their 0000 number in peak time .
0	apparently i should be grateful to have the delivery refunded as a gesture of goodwill .
0	apologising but having an attitude in your voice doesn_'_t really constitute a satisfactory apology .
0	and the other day , one of the customer service people told me that you had had a few problems that morning with drivers so it is a bit pointless making your customer come away feeling dejected when you know you have a problem with your delivery people anyway .
0	poor service , i would never recommend you and out of all the people i spoke to at your customer service , there was one really nice girl ( on monday_morning unfortunately i didn_'_t catch her name ) and the other people just had attutude .
0	i was slightly put off by the site design i . e .
0	are they legitimate , this only because i have been stung before .
0	very happy with the result .
0	who knew ?
0	with parcels 0 go you can send your packages efficiently and at good value .
0	and more_importantly if you need help with the service ( or anything_else life style wise ) their team is there to help .
0	emma saved the day .
0	placed my order on thursday at about 0am , the effects_pedal was in stock and the shipping was reasonable however it was a very small extra_charge to upgrade so it was be delivered on the friday .
0	woke_up today being friday and the parcel is here as predicted .
0	fantastic prices and fantastice service .
0	what else could you want - the reservations are there in store within_seconds of making them , believe me i '_ve tried it .
0	easy to use site .
0	thanks

0	wtf its there fukin foult !!
0	its un fukin believable what the world has come too ...
0	i have been purchasing supplements from bb . com for quite some time , the prices at sw are way better !
0	but the shipping can be killer .
0	prices were very good , bought them online and had them fitted_locally next_day even_though i live in a very remote_area ..
0	i was surprised they could deliver them so quick !
0	i '_ll definitely use them again and recommend them to anyone thanks to their great service !
0	ordered flowers for mothering_sunday knowing my mother would be in .
0	picked prestige because they claimed to deliver that day .
0	arrived saturday .
0	found in porch in full view of passers_by .
0	wilting and dying by next_morning .
0	cost was £_00 . 00 before delivery .
0	bouquet nothing like advertised its pitiful .
0	absolutely_disgusted .
0	always send flowers .
0	never_experienced anything like this .
0	totally_ruined day for both of us .
0	if only i had read all the reviews from various_sites before .
0	i don_'_t know how they are getting away with it .
0	i had a great time and assistance .
0	found everything i needed for great prices .
0	hope to comeback soon .
0	was very pleased with the service printerland gave_us .
0	we have ordered a printer and some spare toners on separate_occasions and had no troubles .
0	delivery was next_day as promised and when we called them for a general query they were very helpful and we didnt have to wait on hold for long either .
0	all in all a great company , will_definitely go back in the future .
0	recommended for all your printer needs home and office .

0	was totally hyped for it .
0	got it at an amazing price £_000 cheaper_than currys were selling it for on the day .
0	definitely recommend using crampton and moore
0	forsvarligt pakket ind , hurtig_levering , alt som ønsket .
0	hvad kan_man ønske mere ?
0	fik bogen hurtigt , og_den_var pakket forsvarlig ind .
0	havde det drejet sig om en mere skrøbelig bog , havde_jeg nok sat pris_på lidt bedre indpakning , men her var_det fint .
0	var pakket i stor kasse med flamingostjerner som isolation .
0	den ankom et_par dage_efter_bestilling , og indholdet var i perfekt stand .
0	personalet gav grundig , kvalificeret vejledning hele vejen .
0	jeg_er_en ret grundig ( krævende ) køber .
0	i have nothing negative to say .
0	swift delivery , pack was safely sealed and we got exactly_what we asked for .
0	this is easily the best app , if you ' re on the fence and can '_t decide all i can say is give it a shot , you wont_regret it
0	000 . com has_been great for me so_far , and i '_ve got luck on my side too !
0	it '_s easy to use and keeps the fun in the game , i ' d definitely refer my friends here
0	i have played bingo for years and this site is easily my new favourite , so easy to use and focused on fun , i cant_wait to finish work to play again !
0	i bought a ticket for an event which is tomorrow and i have still not gotten my tickets and not even a reply to my emails to viagogo !
0	what '_s the point of putting a phone number on the website if you don_'_t intend to have human_being answering them ?
0	and if you can '_t deliver the tickets , then have the courtesy to tell me early enough so that i can find ticket elsewhere ( and obviously not through your website again !).
0	wonder_why viagogo is still in business ?
0	!
0	excellent all_round service by daniel :)
0	bought a brand_new tissot_watch worth £_000 .
0	the watch became_faulty within 0 days .
0	informed them and they said return for inspection .
0	did that and then told we are sending to manufacturer and it will take 0 - 0_weeks for repair .
0	a brand_new watch being repaired !
0	thats uncalled for and simply unacceptable .
0	they violate distance_selling rules and have now filed a paypal case against them .
0	the haae stopped_replying to my e_- mails .
0	a useless company with absolutely_useless customer_services .
0	if you ' re looking for reviews helping you to determine_whether first_utility are a good company to be with , you '_ll be looking for a while .
0	i switched my energy supply to them nearly two months_ago in order to get a cheaper deal .
0	i wondered_why i ' d never_heard of them before , and why their rates were so cheap , and so i searched for reviews .
0	i really wish i ' d done some_research first , as the feedback was vastly negative , but i went and cancelled my registration on the same day .
0	my suspicions were raised when i didn_'_t receive confirmation that i had cancelled .
0	i sent a message to them via their website asking for them to confirm , which they did within a few_days .
0	eventually , i even received the automated confirmation i thought i would have had when i cancelled it on day one .
0	you see , first_utility mentioned in their e_- mails that with a sudden influx of customers , they are having_difficulty keeping their it systems updated , and that any responses to customer queries were taking up to four business days .
0	this is also the problem that caused me to lose money .
0	over the next few weeks , despite cancellation , i received e_- mails_telling_me about joining first_utility .
0	i responded , telling them i wasn_'_t joining them , and that i was switching to edf instead .
0	i probably sent a couple of messages during this period , making_sure that my registration had been cancelled .
0	they confirmed that it had , and told me again about their problems with it systems , and the influx of new customers .
0	again , despite this , i received a direct_debit confirmation a few weeks_ago , for £_00 .
0	this really agitated me , so i e_- mailed to their customer service department .
0	i was also frustrated as first_utility '_s messing_around was interfering with my switchover to edf energy .
0	this received a quicker response , within a day for some reason .
0	they aplogised again for the e_- mails .
0	it systems .
0	new customers .
0	argh .
0	and lo and behold , last_week they actually took money from me .
0	i was furious .
0	just in time for christmas too !
0	i cancelled the direct_debit with my bank , and i plan to block first_utility from taking any more money .
0	i sent another , more angry e_- mail this time , but i '_m still_waiting for a reply nearly 0 days_later .
0	if you ' re on the fence , don_'_t bother .
0	they are a shambles of a company , and the only reason they can offer such amazing deals is because of the complete_lack of customer service .
0	beware !
0	they organise everything , with you just picking what you want to do and when .
0	probably cheaper to arrange yourself but its easy for them to do it .
0	i ordered off [_link_] who they advertise through .
0	the deal seemed too good to be true but it was all there , took printscreens to prove it .
0	i purchased it , a few_days_later i got an email_saying something along the lines as ' the deal isnt for the 0 games and controller ' instead it was for one crappy game not worth anywhere_near the price , even_though they knew i was ordering the bundle they still sent the game ( surely they would of asked ) few_days_later i recieved it and straight_away returned .
0	poor communication , poor customer service , just poor .
0	ordered a set of 0 pirelli online without an issue , arrived at the garage early to get them fitted and the whole_process was finished within 00_mins .
0	very pleased with the service from the garage ( jet garage in orpington ) and the website for black_circles was easy you use .
0	i will without a doubt use them again .
0	ordered a case from them for a very good price but item took longer then expected to arrive and also case was damaged on arrival , not badly but still damaged , thankfully does not effect the working of it or the aesthetics .
0	i did not contact customer_services to get this replaced as it was fun and games enough trying to find out why it took so long .
0	also ordered a fan controller on a seperate order and this arrived in the given time but on closer_inspection i can see that the courier has manhandled the item and all the knobs were slightly_bent , again no reason to get it replaced as the item works and unless your really looking you wont see it .
0	i wouldn_'_t order from them again , rather pay the extra and order from another company .
0	jeg_havde et forløb hos shark gaming hvor min computer gik i stykker meget kort tid før jeg_skulle udrejse fra danmark .
0	her ydede jasper fra shark gaming en kæmpe indsats , der gik langt ud over hvad der kan forventes af_en timelønnet medarbejder .
0	grundet hans indsats og serviceniveau kan_jeg_ikke andet end at give min fulde anbefaling til virksomheden .
0	fast processing , great products and quick delivery .
0	very happy with bulkpowders products and their prices .
0	very good and very professional !
0	we turned to vts_design for web_hosting and a dedicated_server after continual let_downs by our previous_supplier and i can_honestly_say the service has_been first_class .
0	from day one , the service has_been easy , quick and problem free , from transferring our site and database to their servers to offering assistance with our various integrations and even help solving our own internal website issues .
0	all this , combined with some of the most competitive_pricing available means that we '_ll never have to look around for another web_hosting and design company again .
0	no answer to emails / phone_calls .
0	still showing as order processing after 0_weeks despite offering sameday despatch .
0	even terms say goods will be delivered within 0 working_days .
0	spoke to bank to initiate a chargeback .
0	i '_m very trusting when it comes to buying online , probably too trusting .
0	i will make_sure i read_reviews on here before thinking of buying from companies i '_ve not heard of before - as well as letting everyone i know never to buy from these_clowns
0	i was very impressed with the service i received at power_body .
0	buy all my supplements from here .
0	brilliant .
0	very good value and very quick delivery
0	recently got my new beautiful music man sterling bass from these_guys - despite having one in stock , they were happy to take my custom order to my spec , took care of ordering & dealing_with ernie_ball usa while it was built , and kept me informed_throughout - not only that but they smashed everyone_else on price !
0	on the times i '_ve called these_guys , i '_ve spoken to someone_who is actually out there gigging , using the gear & knows what they ' re_talking_about ( instead of some no - playing sales douchebag ), and the service has_been awesome .
0	add in that the website is mega easy to browse & the delivery is free , and you have a very dangerous combination after a few beers !!
0	!
0	long live rad indie music stores & especially nevada_music - cheers_guys !
0	dispatched same day and arrived next_morning despite harsh weather_conditions via_ups .
0	plenty of emails regarding order progress .
0	product very well_packaged which for me is extremely important , no one wants their expensive gear to arrive in a dented box .
0	headphones ( 000 ) are also brilliant :-) * 0_stars .
0	my wife and i planned our trip using priceline and it was headache free .
0	it was so easy to use i couldn_'_t imagine a better or easier way to do so .
0	0 - they reply to any email inquiry in 0 days although in the automated_reply it is 00_hours .
0	0 - the reply is always implicitly guiding you to call the call_center as they wont answer anything or address any issue by mail .
0	0 - no toll free number you have to pay a lot of money just to hear the waiting tunes mainly coldplay myself everytime i hang up when it turns that i ve been waiting for 00_minutes of international call to listen to music .
0	0 - the information on the itinerary on the website is not always available .
0	this is my first time i book with expedia and my last time for sure .
0	0 days after booking and paying our deposit in the beach rang to say they had over booked our flight so our holiday would have to be shifted a day forward and our return flight would return to a different airport !
0	but oh well .. we received out new paper_work with the new dates for hotel and return flight but the outward flight had not changed so we immediately called onthebeach to query this .
0	they said it '_s just an error and will be fine when we get to the airport .
0	we had rang and confirmed this 0 or 0 times before we flew .
0	low and behold we get to the airport to find onthebeach had not changed the flight and we had to pay on the spot £_000 each to fly that day !
0	after_speaking to the customer service agent for monarch airlines they say this happens often with onthebeach clients !
0	now upon returning to the uk we have contacted onthebeach and they say they are looking into what happened !
0	0_weeks_later and still no reply !
0	so it looks_like we will have to contact trading_standards about it .
0	so in summary onthebeach does_exactly_what it says on the tin book with them and you more than likely will end up sleeping on the beach !
0	ordered a coleman extreme cool box , not only a great price was delivered very quickly .
0	was kept_informed with regular_updates by email on the progress of my order .
0	all_round a good experience would certainly look at taunton_leisure for any of my camping needs .
0	very easy to use website , extremely fast shipping and well_packaged .
0	good job !
0	horrible customer service , alarm_bells rang as soon as i realised they only answer the " sales " line and not the " support " line .
0	00 + emails sent , with no reply , followed_by almost_daily phone_calls and i am still_waiting for a replacement a month down the line from initial purchase .
0	i spoke to the same chap on the phone every_single time i rang and he acted as if it was the first time looking into my issue every time .
0	" i will get it sorted for you right now "
0	yeah_right !
0	stay way , way clear of these_guys , the service is horrific .
0	i recommend chilli_sauce to anyone planning a stag or hen party .
0	they take the effort out of booking your weekend , but keep you in control .
0	everything we had booked was ready for us and all the activities / clubs / restaurant were as if the people at chilli_sauce had experienced them first to give their thumbs_up .
0	thank_you for your help in making our weekend a great one .
0	cheers !
0	item arrived promptly and as_described .
0	will use site again as prices are also competitive compared with other online stores .
0	well - designed website , very quick delivery , lower prices than other similar suppliers .
0	truly great customer service .
0	i honestly have no idea about their proce competitiveness or anything like that but everytime i '_ve called their service people about account things or techy things they have been great .
0	i searched around on the best price for a nikon_d0000 .
0	simply_electronics was cheaper by around £_00 and had 0 in stock .
0	many other_retailers had none in stock .
0	i ordered , they debited and then magically it was out of stock .
0	i gave up after 0_weeks and cancelled the order and now they are stalling on a refund hanging onto the money which they have had for nearly two months and over a month since cancellation .
0	it seems like they put out a low price and hang onto payments .
0	thanks excellent quick servicewith reasonable fees
0	quick and easy will do again when i upgrade :)
0	brought bcaas , thurmopure and there new electric shaker .
0	bcaas are an okay price but you know your getting good quality and no fillers .
0	thurmopure cannot rate as such because taking other fat_burners and cortisol inhibitors .
0	the new electric shaker ( mp hurricane ?)
0	well i '_ll score it 0 / 00 because you can only really mix mp impact_whey_protein and not other brands like weight gainers but you can '_t fault it because its running on 0 aaa .
0	it looks great and a good quality 0 / 00 looks 0 / 00 and for the price 0 / 00 great overall could do with a bit more power but looks cool when mixing .
0	mp then silvered the items on the next_day with free standard delivery great 00 / 00 for mp .
0	i brought 0x weight gainers in chocolate ( low gi carbs and good protein ) and they came very fast and tasted great couldn_'_t find the same weight_gainer any where else .
0	good company and will be using again .
0	shopto from my experience is the best around games are always cheaper_than any other site and mosy of the time arrive before the release_date even when games have been lost in the post the problem has_been sorted straight_away would highly_recommend
0	phoned the store to ask for some advice on supplements as there '_s so many to choose from and wanted to get the right ones for me , once we worked out what ones would be best , i made my purchase and received my goods the next_morning :) thanks !

0	its just easy peezey ( cant spell sorry ) :)
0	i am very frustrated with ebay as recently i went to buy an american_football jersey .
0	i had put in the winning bid and the bid had been accepted and the money was taken out of my account .
0	after not receiving the item we contacted ebay where we were faced with a long back and forth phone conversation with the final_result being ebay could not do anything so i had lost my money and didn_'_t receive my item .
0	>:(
0	facebook is fantastic its easy to use and means u can keep in touch with friends and family .
0	one thing i would like to know or see is recently a friend of mine was at another friends house and his friend used his account as a laugh and blocked me without my mate knowing but know we cant seem to unblock each other .
0	maybe there could be the option if the blocker wants to unblock someone they could do that .
0	apart_from that its a gr0 social_network :)
0	what can i say itunes is gr0 everything you want you can find .
0	prices are resonable .
0	easy to use .
0	:)
0	amazon is fantastic the delivery times are quick , prices are cheap and can find everything i need .
0	good job amazon keep it up :)
0	routeone is where i buy a lot of my clothes .
0	i find it a very easy website to use and the service is brilliant .

0	i ordered a sony hvr - v0e camcorder a few_days before_christmas and with all the mayhem that must be happening with postal deliveries slrhut came through managing to deliver my camera just before_christmas_eve .
0	we received a phone_call from slrhut who where very helpful in giving us information on what we where buying and offering us special deals .
0	the camcorder is brilliant and shoots in fantastic quality .
0	i will be using slrhut for all off my equipment from now on .
0	thank_you slrhut :)
0	very cheap and they match competitors prices if you find it on sale somewhere cheaper .
0	i ordered some bench glasses and i was unsure at first whether online prescriptions would be correct so i only opted for the cheaper lenses .
0	i was very suprised with the quality and look of these glasses and will_definately be buying more !
0	!
0	i '_ve bought quite a few items from sportbikeshop now , and i tend to order 0 item at a time rather_than a bulk order , but each time the item has_been shipped correctly and quickly .
0	overall a great shop and excellent service that i '_ll continue to use .
0	ok , do you like games ?
0	do you want them cheap ?
0	do you want them delivered the very next_day after you have ordered ... for free ?
0	if like me , the answer to all 0 is yes , then quite_simply , use shopto .
0	one more note , you get points just for ordering items , my last purchase was £_00 , but when i got to checkout it asked me if i wanted to use my available points ?
0	i said yes , and suddenly my purchase went down to £_00 !
0	!
0	the best gaming site , simply has no equal !
0	keep it up shopto
0	what a joke company .
0	tried to get phone unlocked , had 00 . 00 , spent 00p by_accident , need 00 . 00
0	in order to get it unlocked .
0	they wouldn_'_t let_me top up £_00 just in case this happened , i now have to top up another £_00 to get it over the 00p limit .
0	what can i do ?
0	nothing but bend_over and take it , will never use them ever .
0	wouldn_'_t let_me cancel my course prior to it '_s beginning , even considering it was a self taught online only only course and it had yet to start .
0	was told different things by different staff_members and my case was handed about like a hot potato .
0	although a lovely user_friendly front end website that makes payment seamless and easy , the back end learning system feels antiquated and muddled .
0	a bizarre experience from beginning to end from a school of " marketing ".

0	what '_s happening to the royal_mail ?
0	in the face of new and upcoming competition they aren_'_t working to be more efficient and a better service , they are just putting up prices and closing branches ??
0	?
0	i had to pay £ 0 for a small light parcel today , a year or two ago that kind of thing would have cost only £ 0 . 00 .
0	how the hell has the cost doubled in that time ?
0	i had to ask the counter lady the cost twice because i was genuinely astounded .
0	i '_m angry that i went_ahead with it anyway but i was in a rush , held to ransom by time and these now crooks .
0	i sent a small letter special delivery the other day , that was £ 0 , up from just £ 0 . 00 a year or two ago , again .
0	basically , i won_'_t be using royal_mail anymore for any parcels and i won_'_t send something special except in the most dire of circumstances .
0	with the ongoing branch closures and spiralling prices this once great and highly reasonable mail service is drawing it '_s last breaths .
0	we used codepack after using their sister company , okidirect , for a qr_code reader for a clients marketing project .
0	they helped_us pick out which was the right product for our needs , were competitive on price and got it delivered fast .
0	great service .
0	i bought a small oki_c000dn from these_guys for general small office use .
0	was a good price , delivered next_day , can '_t complain !
0	i recently_purchased a costume from these_guys and their service was a class !
0	they were nothing but helpful and got my order out same day so i had it in time for a party the very next night .
0	would highly_recommend and would definitely use again .
0	keep_up the good work guys !
0	have used paypal for many_years .
0	very useful service but customer service is generally pretty bad .
0	they can also be a pain if you are a seller on ebay , with holding payments until they are satisfied you aren_'_t fraudulent .
0	innocent until proven guilty anyone ?
0	i '_ve_used amazon for over 0 years .
0	i '_ve never had a problem with them .
0	they are a class outfit and know their business model well .
0	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0	paid for item and next_day delivery .
0	delivery was left " at wrong depot " even_though website said it had been completed .
0	submitted webform .
0	no response .
0	emailed , got a reply next_morning " blah_blah apologies will send out today or tommorow maybe " (?!!)
0	emailed back to confirm date and not for it to be friday_morning .
0	got no repsonse .
0	low and behold friday_morning it arrives .
0	fruit is fresh but the customer service stinks !
0	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0	seemingly my case was a one off and hopefully the holes in there customer service are being addressed .
0	i can '_t fault a business that is prepared to offer a full_refund when it feels it has not measured up to it '_s own standards .
0	a decent basket for the price .
0	i have had a few orders from the watersports_warehouse and every time the entire service has_been incredibly good .
0	the lady_who dealt_with my orders over the phone was very friendly and helpful and went out of her way to have my order with me by the next_day at short_notice .
0	all in all a very well run business with great customer relationship , a pleasure to do_business with .
0	highly_recommended !
0	spot on !
0	bargain , gd for business and recommended
0	bought several keys from this store in the past year or so , all the minor_problem i had were solved faster then on other online stores .
0	prices are low but sometimes not the lowest , still it '_s worth pay a bit more and get a good support some times .
0	overal a real good store and a good costumer service .
0	keep the good work .
0	i found this website today after looking for a place that does cheap and instant ms_points and at first i was a bit_sceptical but after_seeing the reviews i gave it a go and i '_m glad i did as it was cheap and fast .
0	i will defently come_back here when i need more ms_points or to renew my xbox membership .
0	don_'_t trust argos at all , all you will get is poor customer service and a complete_lack of information .
0	i bought a hoover from them 0 years_ago , plus the additional 0 - year in - store warranty .
0	all was fine till the hoover stopped_working , i brought it back , no problem getting another one .
0	the only problem is that i accepted to have the money refunded on a gift_card instead of the cash given back to me , so i got my new hoover through the gift_card .
0	when the new hoover stopped_working_properly after only 0 months , i brought it back asking for the same one but no more in stock anywhere_near my area .
0	i then asked for a full_refund but they would only do it on my gift_card , not on my bank_account .
0	so i had no choice but to get something from argos again .
0	i asked how long to wait for the same hoover , i was told 0_weeks , left my name and number and they said they would let_me know .
0	after 0_weeks still nothing , so i went back to the same store to speak to the same man , just to be told that the item had been_discontinued !
0	no information whatsoever given before i went in myself , i probably could have waited for a year , clearly no one bothered to find out what was going on .
0	and i will still have to buy at argos , because of that stupid gift_card which is nothing but a nasty trick designed to keep you buying from them .
0	this is obviously the last time i will give them any of my money , and anyone reading this review is strongly advised to stay_away form argos .
0	you have been_warned .
0	the properties they have on offer look fantastic but unfortunately for at_least another 0 / 0 years i will not be stay if any over their properties as the party i go on holiday with ( which is mostly family ) are all under 00 .
0	i was extremely disappointed that after finding the penthouse , pearl 0 in newquay on their site paying the deposit ( twice ) to be told that as the majority of the party was under 00 , the management of the property had stated they would not accept our booking , when i queried why i was told it was because previous parties at their properties that were of our age_group had caused a " substantial " amount of damage .
0	i understand they need to protect the property owners but with all due respect the security_deposit they were asking for was in excess of £ 0000 . 00 which we were happy to pay and following reading their t &_cs it also states they can take up to £_000 . 00 extra off your card for damage .
0	if this isn_'_t a big enough security_deposit for the owner to accept a wider market of customers then surely they need to make the security_deposit even higher or increase the amount it costs to stay there !
0	i mean last_year we stayed in the ritz new_york , no deposit required but a much higher nightly rate at no point did they ask for our ages .
0	from a service point as well how take they take the deposit from us before confirming the booking then tell me they have cancelled it when i can quite clearly see they haven_'_t cancelled the payment fully as i work at the bank where the payment was intended to come from .
0	also to say it is in our t &_cs about group bookings for under 00s , which i do not dispute it is but it is at the very bottom and states that they only decline bookings where all party member on under 00 , not majority of the party as when i asked if we are accompanied_by one our parents ( baring in mind the majority of us over 00 anyway !)
0	would they accept the party they again stated they wouldn_'_t .
0	i am truly gutted we couldn_'_t go the property we wanted as it would have been my sister in laws dream birthday , i would not advise you use this company when looking at bookings for more 0 adults if you any of you are under 00 .
0	a fantastic website , good communications and speedy delivery .
0	what more could you ask for ?
0	same product at a better price .
0	that being said ; they should offer free shipping on orders over $_000 or more not the $_000 or so it is now .
0	0nd time using epcc guys and we are absolutely_thrilled with our new tees .
0	the placing / size was spot on and the turnaround time was excellent .
0	we have taken our clothing to various stores and now are set to be stocked in various_places in the south_west of england .
0	great pricing / great communication / ordering again very soon .
0	i always buy from here .
0	it '_s way more affordable than anything you can find in a physical_store .
0	i ' d recommend to anyone interested in supplements .
0	they sent me an email_saying they had missed me , they wanted me to order something else so i did .
0	they also sent me a unique code for a 0000 alpine stars hat .
0	the delivery time was fast , can '_t complain .
0	i had no issues what so ever .
0	i ' d highly_recommend these_people .
0	thanks !
0	very impressed with the whole service and especially the quality of the tags
0	best price i could_find ... including several top online_retailers !
0	great delivery too .
0	thanks
0	having booked and paid for a reservation through them , the agent refused to rent me the car because i did not comply with their policy .
0	the agent said no money had been transferred to them and rentalcars . com was responsible to refund me .
0	rentalcars . com has refused to give me a refund on the grounds that the supposed ' cancellation ' had been done after the pick_up time !
0	even_though i had not cancelled and was refused the car !
0	this is a scam and they should be held_accountable for it !
0	really informative website .
0	the company '_s product review rated the item ( soundmagic_pl00 ) very highly , yet the headphones still turned_out to be even better_than_expected .
0	significantly better_than the denon '_s , originally costing twice as much , that they replaced .
0	good price .
0	faultless communication_throughout .
0	delivery via_royal_mail within_00hrs .
0	and yes , finding a lollipop at the bottom of the parcel did make me smile !
0	bought a nintendo ds lite for my daughter when i received the item the box was damaged and the packaging fell_apart .
0	the touchscreen was very unresponsive there where finger_prints all over the screen within_0hours of my daughter playing this system the screen froze and went a bright purple colour .
0	i sent the item back because it was faulty stating that i want a refund but they refused because they said the packaging was damaged .
0	so i would have to buy new packaging to send to this company in order for me to get a refund on a faulty product or i would have to pay them to send me this faulty product back to me .
0	the manager was rude and unhelpful he basically just wanted me to get off the phone .
0	my advice is to avoid this company at all costs they will say anything not to give your money back !
0	!
0	ordered nearly 0_weeks_ago and was told that there was a stock_shortage two_weeks_later after i contacted them to find out what had happened .
0	nearly 0_weeks_later , still no order , no refund , and they '_ve stopped_replying to my emails .
0	stay well away !
0	the service was absolutely great , it was very easy to find what i was looking for and order it and then the delivery was very fast and the product i bought was exactly_what i wanted and in perfect_condition !
0	great service , surprisingly quick delivery time !
0	i was skeptical ordering flat_pack furniture , but i had no reason to be , delivered within days assembly quite easy ( when you read the instructions that is , assembled it the wrong way first time round thinking i didn_'_t need it )
0	all the peices just lock in place , no tools required , sofa can be taken apart back to flatpack if you move , very comfortable too .
0	we bought a sofa from them just over 0 months_ago now , and still very happy , many people have commented on the quality of it , often surprised when we said it was a self_assembly item .
0	will be looking to buying more with them in the future :)
0	this company is the only company i could_find online that will sell topupvouchers for your pay as you go phone without charging extra , they have a bit of an annoying security system , the first order you make you have to confirm its you with your land line , they phone you , give you a 0 digit_code , that confirms who you are then you can order as much as you like from them , once thats confirmed ordering is very fast , quick email codes for your phone too , they also give you a 00_%_discount for your second order :)
0	ordered from chilled pc , i only live around 0 miles_away and they let_me pick_up the goods same day , always excellent prices , very friendly support .
0	they have a community built forum , members are always happy to help you out , and its not as childlike as many other web forums of shops i '_ve been to ..
0	have a look at some of the case mods in the forum too , some truely excellent work ;)
0	bought a tv for my nan for chirstmas , after a few_months the tv was acting up , at first i thought itwas my nan going crazy as i had a look at it and it was fine , then for no reason tv wouldn_'_t turned on , after a bit of playing around it was the powerpack that failed .
0	no problem , thought i ' d returned it , packed it all up ready to go back , filled in the online rma request , strangly after about 00_minutes had a phonecall from ebuyer , they told me no need to send the entire tv back , and they '_ll ship out a new powerpack for the tv , 0 days_later recieved new powerpack free of charge , was quite impressed with how quick it was , i '_ve had some returns take months to get back !
0	used dabs quite a few_times over the years , and figured i should start rating companies i '_ve only had good experiances with !
0	generally buy clearance or used stock from dabs to save_money , well if the option is there , and everytime has_been excellent , so_far i '_ve had one motherboard fail on me under_warranty and had no issues returning the item , obviously its not there fault it failed , but it was quick and easy to replace it , so no_complains , always one of my first choices when buying new hardare
0	i bought an alternator for my volvo_s00 , ok it was a very good price £_00 delivered , but i still expected it to work , upon fitting it sounding like metal grinding against metal , not like the bearings had gone , as if the insides were properly grinding against itself , anyways i thought no_worries got a 0 month_warranty , contacted ' new city parts ' as thats who 00 / 0 directed me to , the phone number was always busy and after 0 minutes i would get a message_telling_me to try calling back later and would hang up , for 0 months i tried to contact them , so in frustration i turned to 00 / 0 spares , emailed , tried to find a phonenumber but couldn_'_t find one ...
0	incidently after double_checking the part numbers , the part did fit my car , but it was from the pre facelift model , i '_m_sure its the same part but they insisted it was from a facelift model car .
0	will avoid in future , and have learnt to just buy new instead of trying to save , at_least , buy new if your local scrappy doesn_'_t have it ;)
0	used the website to ask what was happening , was told someone would get back to me , that was a week_ago , using paypal to try and get a refund , would stay_away from , i knew there hsould of been a reason their site was so cheap
0	i placed the order on tuesday , the postage bag arrived on wednesday and i posted the phone that afternoon , email to say it had arrived on thursday 0pm , £_00 im my bank at 0 . 00pm on thursday_night .
0	sweet .
0	this is our 0th time of doing_business .
0	gamola are always helpful , fast and with a great selection of quality products .
0	i particularly like the fast website and the fact that gamola take paypal , so no_messing_about with credit_cards over the phone .
0	i plan to keep_coming_back .
0	had never_heard of go - electrical until they appeared in a google shopper search .
0	they were the cheapest for what i was looking for so i ordered from them crossing fingers that all would be well .
0	great priced product (~£ 00 cheaper_than everyone_else ) and no rip_off postage fee either .
0	order was picked_up by them on wednesday_morning , had it delivered to us on the friday .
0	00 / 00
0	would definitely use again .
0	thanks !
0	the laptop description was accurate , the purchase process fast and the delivery efficient .
0	nothing to add , excellent .
0	a great website , great products and good communication .
0	dispatch and delivery was quick too .
0	will_definitely use again
0	ordered at 0pm , received the next_day while still being cheapest for that particular product online .
0	cannot_fault !
0	the product arrived really quickly and was awesome , great value for money also !
0	:-)
0	i am one of the first adapters with parcelbright and i was previously with parcel0go and parcelmonkey .
0	i have to say that i am very happy with their services since they have good rates for dhl next_day as well as customer_services .
0	daniel , who i believe is my account_manager always deal with my query in a timely_manner and update me throughout the process .
0	i haven_'_t lost or damaged a single parcel yet with them and hopefully they will keep their services at this level :)
0	read the other review and therefore made up my mind to go with company_formations 000 instead of the one my friend recommended me .
0	a bit disappointed to be honest .
0	check out was quick and easy , they first take money out therefore you have no way back .
0	afterward they will tell you what add - on you can purchase however you have already made the payment .
0	i first thought the " gold package " includes " registered office service " therefore they will forward the important document to me free of charge , but apparently when i fill in the details they ask if i want to use their redirect services otherwise my residential address will be shown as the services address .
0	i would like to point out that the intention for " registered office service " is to protect the director ( buyer ) home address however if the services address is made public and you have to pay extra to protect it .
0	it makes no sense to have a registered office address where the public can just find out where you live from the services address .
0	and this should be explained_clearly in the package page and also they should not take the payment until the final step .
0	other then that everything was smooth and solid hence the 0_star_review .
0	if you need to transfer money overseas , this is the easiest and most cost efficient method out there that i '_ve found .
0	give it a go .
0	it '_s simple , it '_s quick and you only have to pay a 00_% deposit .
0	works for me !
0	i placed 0 orders in tailor0less :
0	0st order : one shirt .
0	it arrived in less_than 00 days , both fabric and measurement were above expectations
0	0n order : one jacket .
0	it had small problems in the sleeves length measurement .
0	i brought it to a local tailor , he fixed it and then tailor0less returned the cost of adjustment .
0	great service !
0	we visited nottingham on a stag_do in april_0000 that was run by chilli_sauce , first time with this company but have been on many other stag dos .
0	great hotel , clean , great breakfast .
0	all restaurants and night clubs we visited on our list were super , got straight in on the guest lists even_though there was a large group of us lads .
0	also the go carting was one of the best tracks and experiences we had .
0	they have everything i could_possibly want at a fraction of the price .
0	for years i went to the big chain_stores ( gnc , complete nutrition , vitamin world , etc_.).
0	one day a friend of mine mentioned this website to me .
0	i went home and scoped it out that night .
0	once i saw the prices and great variety , i was sold !
0	i no_longer have to burn extra cash on my supps .
0	and they always have free_samples to try new things .
0	i could not be_happier !
0	i recommend them to everyone , whether a bodybuilder , athlete , or just looking for everyday vitamins .
0	you can '_t go_wrong !
0	!
0	brilliant place .
0	genuinely cheap_smells compared to other_sites .
0	cracking delivery too , told me to expect 0 - 0 days , it arrived in 0 !
0	brilliant website , i '_m just disappointed it '_s taken me so long to find it .
0	they have it all and it '_s all very competitively_priced , ease of ordering and customer service is second to none .
0	my order arrived on time , in perfect_condition all very discreetly_packaged away from prying eyes , not to mention the free_gift that was included unexpectedly .
0	will_definately be using twisted miss again in the future .
0	great price , communications and delivery from the firm .
0	would have no_hesitation using again .
0	no_hesitation in recommending - the clothes i ordered are of excellent quality , fit and look really good !
0	delivery was also fantastic - ordered yesterday morning and here today !
0	used the site to purchase a 0 different items at once .
0	site was easy to navigate and find out the information needed to make my choices .
0	delivery came exactly at the time promised - contents were well_packaged and all intact .

0	called inga 0am yesterday , said delivery guy would call 0_hr prior to delivery , they arrived 0 . 00am , left polystyrene mess both outside my flat and inside and not taken packaging !
0	!
0	would not recommend electricshop . com to anyone .
0	will be buying from curry '_s next time even at higher price but at_least they provide a better delivery service and adjust levelling feet on fridges for you ...
0	ordered tickets to see beyonce at the o0 ... was scared as i ' v never used a site like this before but the reviews sold it to me and they werent wrong i emailed customer_services a few_times panicked they assured me everything was confirmed tickets arrived proptly and required a signature the seats were amazing directly infront of the stage .
0	if you ever need last_minute tickets dont hesitate to book through these_guys .
0	highly_recomended a +++++++
0	supplement_warehouse offers the best prices , selection , and they are hands_down the best seller of supplements !
0	i ordered flowers for my wifes_birthday but they did not arive when i contacted the company i was assured they would come the next_day ( the day after my wifes_birthday ).
0	this again did not happen .
0	the live_chat is terrible with advisors who obviously have no clue about customer service .
0	i would stay well clear of this company , i will apparently recieve a refund in 0 - 0 working_days however i am left with a dissapointed wife and no flowers !!
0	!
0	item appeared to be in stock until i ordered it .
0	does not reply to emails .
0	not sent until a month after ordering ( ordered on 00 jan , sent on 00 feb ).

0	and they are all of superior quality .
0	i recently_purchased the fuji_finepix hs00exr and it is by far the best bridge_camera out there .
0	play is the next best thing to amazon , in fact in someways they are better as they always have free shipping .
0	a great online seller , with a broad_selection of products and fast shipping .
0	great prices for working and non working phones , fast delivery of sales pack and cheques .
0	can not fault them in any way .
0	highly_recommend !
0	i have been a customer since july_0000 .
0	just recently i needed help with porting a number across to soho00 .
0	andy in the support_team has_been fantastic - his prompt , helpful and patient replies to a long email thread helped_us complete the process swiftly .
0	this really sets the bar for customer service .
0	i have been wearing knox armour now for 0 years , i ride in british superbike , i use their gloves which are the best protection gloves i '_ve ever wore , so much comfort and protection in one .
0	i also use there under suits " cool and dry " which do exactly_what they are called ..
0	i use they ' re in leather armour , chest and back armour , and i have to say it is second to none as i have tested it to its full potential and it '_s never left me with broken bones ..
0	if i can keep using armour for the remainder of my career , i would certainly like to do so as it is top stuff .
0	i purchased xbox_live_subscription , and i am really pleased with how fast cost_effective and painless the process was .
0	i will be recommending this to all my friends and family and plan to be coming_back again in the near_future .
0	great service .
0	thanks
0	they had a great selection of laptops , and the customization was the best part .
0	i don_'_t need windows , and they were the only seller willing to give me an windows free pc .
0	what '_s more , i needed the item delivered in the uk , but the payment would be made from my dad in south_africa .
0	they were really friendly and helpful with sorting_out the shipping , and invoice info -- catering to every whim of our bank .
0	the laptop arrived well ahead of the estimated delivery date , and it worked_perfectly with gnu / linux .
0	even all of the fn - key functions worked right out of the box -- a rare_occurrence for a linux user .
0	best .
0	store .
0	ever .
0	this was a great experience .
0	the product was way cheaper_than the closest alternative and arrived real fast .
0	i used it to clean a dishwasher in a volunteer run bar that smelled like a cat died in there .
0	after two washes it smells like fairy farts and roses .
0	i would definitely use this company again .
0	a very wide_selection of products , with a promotion every week .
0	i got an £ 0 shaker for free with my order .
0	it arrived within two_days , even with the slowest shipping option .
0	no payment hassles and the delivery instruction were followed to the letter .
0	i am impressed
0	they kept me informed of my order , and i even had a delivery time to the exact hour given to me on the day my guitar arrived .
0	will buy from them again in the future .
0	ofrece todo lo_que otros antivirus ofrecen , pero la diferencia con los otros es_que no consume muchos recursos , no se vuelve lenta la computadora , aparte detecta los virus al instante
0	i would recommend these_guys any day !
0	they pay the price quoted online , and paid me the same day they received my phone ( one day after_posting it !)
0	they offered me a better price than most of their competitors , too - only one company beat them , but i needed the cash fast , so mazuma was my choice .
0	highly_recommended , will_definitely use again at the end of my contract .
0	great place for a stag night !
0	i recently_bought 0 sofa '_s from the isme website .
0	i say recently , but i actually ordered them in early september and was told they ' d be delivered 0_weeks_later .
0	not ideal , but at_least they were honest about it from the start .
0	when i called closer to the delivery date to confirm it was still arriving on the date mentioned 0_weeks prior , isme customer_services had no info for me and told me to call the delivery company .
0	this is where it got messy so i '_ll sum_up in bullet_points ...
0	* finally got a text_telling_me my delivery date ( times were ' between_0am and 0pm ) and was told i ' d get a call 00_mins before delivery , so i booked a day off of work to be home for it .
0	* at 00 : 00 i get a text saying they tried to deliver and left a card .
0	this was a flat out lie and i suspect as it was already late in the day , the driver coun '_t be_bothered to do another drop_off .
0	i received no phonecall , and to leave a card , they ' d have had to ring the flat buzzer to get into the block and then drop it through my door ... of course there was no card .
0	* called the delivery place and got fobbed_off and told to rearrange the delivery ... so i requested it be delivered on a saturday this time .
0	* again , i recieved no call 00_mins before delivery but knowing it was unlikely i would , i awoke at 0am on my saturday and waited_till the early_afternoon for the delivery .
0	* when they did finally arrive i went down to find them as they couldn_'_t find my flat .
0	there they took one sofa off the truck .
0	as soon as i mentioned there should be 0 the driver seemed to take an attitude with me and just kept saying " there '_s only one , call the company if that '_s wrong " ( despite the fact that the packaging clearly said item 0 of 0 on it ) in a tone that left no doubt he was a moody ... moving on ...
0	* called up the company who said ' whoops ' and said the other sofa would be with me on tuesday and that i ' d get a call 00_mins before they arrived .
0	* i reluctantly booked another day of annual_leave from work .
0	got up at 0am and waited all day .
0	again ... no phone_call .
0	sofa finally arrived in the afternoon .
0	the items were fine and a good price , the service left me wanting to make someone suffer .
0	i '_ll never use this company ( or any of it '_s associated retailers ) again and next time will pay the extra to get it else where ... most places would have delivered the next_day ... not 0_weeks after paying for the item .
0	it '_s just not worth the hassle and stress of having to deal with these_people .
0	i sent an email to them complaining directly but that was weeks_ago and as they didn_'_t respond , i figured i ' d share my experience with you and let you decide if it '_s worth the risk and headache .
0	website was a pleasure to use , simple and saves configurations so u can build various set ups before_deciding .
0	wide_variety and prices are clearly_stated and updated .
0	prices were the best i could_find whilst_researching a place to get the pc and reviews dating back a few_years were all good ( wish i ' d known about them last time i bought a pc ).
0	recieved the item just over a week from the day i ordered and was kept_informed_throughout by one guy_who was quick to respond to queries and knew his stuff .
0	machine runs perfectly and when i need a new one cyberpower will be where i go .
0	i ordered my sign last thursday and got standard delivery as i did not need the item until today , however sat at work the following_day it turned_up .
0	outstanding service and a very easy site to use also .
0	would recommend and use again .
0	rob
0	thanks banana_fingers !
0	!
0	rapid , awesome service as always !
0	ordered a rope , came the next_day with free_postage !
0	cheers :)
0	they went out of their way to get hold of the products in my order and sent sent them very fast .
0	great service , thanks ellis_brigham !
0	posted phone thursday , full_amount_quoted in my bank_account by saturday .
0	fifty notes for an old phone with minimum hassle !
0	[_name removed_] took over £_000 of my money and has given us nothing !
0	website looked good so ordered some engraved glasses .
0	comunication was great up until i sent money , then ignored my emails and never answers the phone , when he did answere gave_me excuse after excuse for delays but still nothing ..
0	i had ordered engraved glasses with another company who turned_out to be a fraud , so i contacted promo gifts .
0	i '_m so please to have discovered this company .
0	their comunication , transactions and products where excellent .
0	the glasses arrived in time for our event , even_though i hadn_'_t given them much notice , and they looked great !
0	had an issue with parcel being collected on wrong day courier went to collect !
0	thought i would have to pay again but ( emma ) sorted it at no cost !
0	brilliant thank_you
0	and very good value as well .
0	i have used these_guys a few_times now and every time perfect service even next_day delivery 0 days before_christmas which surprised me massively , top_notch work here
0	easy to use site and very prompt payment .
0	i paid for an origin_key , this is what was advertised on the website and what it shows on the paypal confirmation page , what you actually get however is not an origin_key , it is an amd ' promotions ' code which may or may not work .
0	the link they give sends you to an amd page to ' redeem the code ', once you click this , you are told to make an account , giving amd all of your personal information , then it comes to a screen to enter the code ... but wait !
0	it also asks for ' manufacturer ' and ' reseller ' as the code is not an origin code , it is some kind of amd video card promotions code .
0	i have tried to contact support and get an actual real origin code but they keep telling_me to go to the amd site and it will give me a code .... i have even had to take screenshots of the page which pops_up and still no code i paid for , i am going to be forced to contact paypal and say i did not receive the goods i paid for .
0	terrible_terrible support from cjs .
0	i ordered a sofa which arrived broken in august ; i was assured it would be fixed within a week !
0	a called , emailed contacted head_office about 00 times and im not even exaggerating .
0	i was promised it would be fixed everytime .
0	eventually in the end of november i had them collect the sofa and refund my money - surely it would have been easier to just fix the sofa or even sent me a new one in that amount of time !
0	no one ever apologised and i felt_like it was a complete_joke !
0	do not order from furniture_village ( honestly don_'_t ) - so much stress and time wasted for nothing ( just got our new sofa from dfs delivered in 0_weeks and the service is much_better just check out their review !)
0	i sent my phines in on monday and the money was in my account tuesday_afternoon !
0	wow that was quick !
0	also the prices are the best vie found online .
0	took_advantage of alfred sargent free shoe tree offer , ordered 0 pairs over a couple of weeks , all arrived within 0 working_days .
0	mike small and his_team are a pleasure to deal with , and sure to purchase more pairs down the track .
0	ordered 00 quid worth of flowers for v day yesterday , ordered them a week before hand .
0	not delivered , says order was cancelled on website login on the day .
0	not email , not phone_call and the number they give is a dead line .
0	taken the money out of my visa , no sign of a refund and i am angry !
0	not to metion the gf who was upset !
0	someone report these scamming twats and take them to court !
0	the online service i experienced with pleasance_& harper was second to none .
0	the website was clear and easy to use , the prices were more or less the best i could_find and the free next_day delivery was unbelievable in that it actually was free and actually was next_day - unlike_some other_sites who make these bold claims but fail to deliver .
0	the item was well_packaged and arrived_safely in mint_condition .
0	i have already_recommended this company to several friends and will_certainly return to pleasance_& harper when i next need a new timepiece .
0	very impressive all_round .
0	thanks would buy from u agin very good time on delivery and a grate price thanks ones agin
0	about four years_ago i bought a golf_trolley from pro_rider because they were the cheapest quality trolley of the time .
0	it still goes strong and i recently sold it second_hand so that i could upgrade .
0	i looked around again and they are still the cheapest , it '_s amazing .
0	i then ordered the lithium_battery one and its arrived today .
0	i '_m not playing til thursday but if this one is anything like the last one its going to be great .
0	i couldn_'_t get over how small and light the battery is too .
0	i can '_t wait to use it now .
0	overall good , customer service lacking though
0	xile_clothing have a good selection of clothing but beware .
0	i bought a jacket last month with the intention of wearing it this weekend for an event .
0	upon_receiving this i emailed a query through to customer_services advising that the product arrived with no tags but i received no response .
0	yesterday i tried the jacket on again and when i tried to tighten the jacket using the drawstring this has a hole in it !
0	xile_clothing have clearly sent me a product that has already been used in my opinion .
0	no tags , hold inside the jacket and the collar smells of aftershave .
0	not a pleasant_experience at all and i certainly wont be using xile again .
0	dude this place is great for scrapping any unwanted computor .
0	and they give you a quote .
0	no strings_attached .
0	guitar_fx direct has a nice selection of great pedals to affordable prices .
0	they provide good services and replies quickly whatever questions you might have !
0	if i can '_t find what i '_m looking for , then it '_s because i haven_'_t checked guitar_fx direct !
0	i most certainly recommend you to go check out their website !
0	received key for crysis_0 00_minutes post - payment .
0	have good faith battlefield_0 will arrive on time at release .
0	solid service , would recommend to friends .
0	previously purchased battlefield_0 from them and again they were flawless in delivery .
0	great prices , delivered both_times within time frame - no reason not to use them .
0	so let_me start by saying that my product did arrive and it was in good condition .
0	however , the company took my payment as soon as i ordered and did not ship the product for 0 days !
0	after 0 days i was extremely concerned and had the same customer service rep telling_me " your product will arrive by friday ."
0	i didn_'_t see this possible .. on friday i checked again and to no surprise my product had not been shipped ..
0	i contacted them again and this time i finally received a different service rep !
0	he guaranteed my product will be there by monday , and it did arrive on monday .
0	i did not enjoy my experience with this company and will not be using them again .
0	i do not recommend this company .
0	definitely would recommend to a friend , nothing to complain_about .
0	i found everything i was after for cheaper_than i was expecting to pay and had the products safely delivered within days of placing the order .
0	only_concern that they may have been to careful with the packaging to make_sure none of it got damaged ;)
0	what more can i say to elaborate the heading !
0	my first experience with this company was quiete shocking .
0	when i arrived to their office i realiyed that i could get the car for the same price only if i want it without insurance .
0	seriously who would hire a car without insurance ?
0	so , of course i needed to pay than i booked the car .
0	except this everything was fine but is not a good attitude for a big company !
0	due to my job i use search_engines quiet a lot and google is by far the best i have ever used .
0	it is so simple and give the accurate information in only seconds .
0	great service i ordered on a friday and it came the next_day , when it said it wouldn_'_t arrive until the 00rd so thank_you for being so quick :)
0	considering everything is online i have no_complaints .
0	the process of building my laptop was transparent , they managed my expectation with regards to how long it would take to build my laptop .
0	i have no_complaints .
0	i was initially a little_dubious_about using cjs_cd_keys .
0	i then read a couple of reviews and decided to take the plunge and was pleasantly_surprised by how quick the service was .
0	most of all i was encouraged by the sms / text_message authentication service they use which added to my impression that i was dealing_with a legit company .
0	i have now purchased my cd_key which works great .
0	five_stars .
0	i have now subsequent to the first review also bought battlefield_0 and again no_problems .
0	they are quick to reply to my service requests so i am very happy all_round .
0	like i said above , sells what i want and delivers fast .
0	also they appear to have a wide_variety so there is a lot to choose from .
0	never had problems with delivery .
0	i spent a lot of time researching online companies from which to purchase my canon_eos 0d and ef 00 - 000mm_l usm_lens .
0	considering the large financial outlay i wanted to make_sure i was buying from a reputable_company .
0	i found other_companies with marginally_cheaper prices but they all looked dodgy and suspicious ( online reviews of them were not convincing and many people expressed concern ).
0	eventually i found hdew_cameras and after a little online research discovered there were many other satisfied customers so i took the plunge .
0	i was very impressed with the service .
0	i was able to call into their_offices in surrey and the service and help was exceptional .
0	i even got a callback from shaun once my items were dispatched .
0	i would highly_recommend hdew_cameras and will_certainly be purchasing more camera_equipment from them in the future .
0	price wise they are exceptionally competitive but the excellent customer service and the fact that there is a number i can call and a human i can speak to tipped the scales for me .
0	there '_s not much to say when ordering a compact_flash card , it arrived quickly and in good order , and of course it works as expected .
0	the best online customer_support for any pc manufacturer ive never found an easier site to get on with , easy to find driver updates and easier still for downloads
0	probably one of the worst search_engines ever its constantly getting problems like " dns doesnt exist " or " couldnt find webpage / could_possibly be expired " honestly its crap
0	obviously im going to be a little_bit biased about o0 as im an o0 customer but they are still one of the better network_providers
0	the best search_engine ever
0	busuu is great for meeting and getting to speak with natives of the language you are trying to learn .
0	i like the idea of natives and speakers of the language marking your exercises as you can get fast feedback but it '_s not always trustworthy .
0	i '_ve seen plenty of cases where someone has tried to correct an english exercise but the correction was riddled with errors .
0	this is not good for someone trying to learn the language .
0	they need to see almost perfect english / german / italian / whatever the language may be , if not it can be very easy to get confused .
0	everyone seems to correct exercises differently and a guideline for those marking exercises would be useful .
0	busuu lacks in one major area which is grammar lessons .
0	there are few explanations on the grammar and structure of sentences which is one of the main crucial areas of learning a language .
0	this is why i think busuu should only be used as an additional tool coincide with a language course or book and not a single learning resource .
0	it would be beneficial for busuu and it '_s users to concentrate on tackling the grammar issues to improve it '_s service .
0	i believe a lot of small improvements can be made but the it team ( if they use the site ) should be able to recognise most of these .
0	a new feature i would love to see is classrooms .
0	this is where users from the same native_language could enrol into a class that has a trusted community member ( s ) or a paid busuu staff_member that will help teach the class members .
0	this would be much more beneficial than trying to speak to another member to help with your chosen language that doesn_'_t know your own language .
0	people in the class can speak to one another and help one another progress .
0	you can proceed to the more advanced classes when the tutor believes you know enough to proceed and are consistent with using correct grammar and vocabulary within the unit .
0	this will help force more repetition and more learning rather_than writing a few poor sentences that get badly marked and then proceeding to the next unit without actually learning anything .
0	in summary_:
0	i believe busuu is a great place to make contacts with natives in the language you are wanting to learn which makes it a valuable resources .
0	without grammar lessons , as it stands busuu isn_'_t comprehensive enough to actually learn a language from using it alone .
0	there should be trusted community members or paid tutors to go over corrections to make_sure the student of the language is not being mislead by a correction .
0	i believe more support needs to be added for members to learn together and stay motivated .
0	used workwear_express 0 times now and i honestly don_'_t know what made me use them again ( apart_from them being at the top of google and the actual ordering is a relatively easy process , providing their website is working correctly !)
0	my first service was very slow to say the least , didn_'_t get our items when promised but wasn_'_t kept_informed , i only knew how long the delay was going to be because i kept calling to check .
0	then i needed a couple more shirts the same but had to order over phone as their website would not add the logo '_s correctly .
0	this time they arrived only a day late or so but with one of the logo '_s missing !
0	so i had to get them sent back and wait again !
0	not only was the inconvenient for us but when i called about a week_later to check when we would get the shirts back with the second logo on ... they had actually not even started as they ' forgot ' they had received them back from us !
0	now on nov 0st i placed a new order for work wear for an open day event , the other day i called up to check on my order ( as their website says 0 day turn_around ) turns_out they are not even going to be dispatched until the 00th !!!
0	as they don_'_t have stock !
0	if you are happy to wait more than 0_weeks then great but if you ' re looking for the express service you think you ' d get or the ' 0 day turnaround ' they advertise and promise do not use workwear_express .
0	customer service is actually appalling , couldn_'_t care less either time , no %_off offered or anything , i hardly even got an_apology !
0	my company wouldn_'_t be in business if we provided customer service as bad as theirs !
0	i don_'_t know how they are still in business when all 0 of my orders was an awful experience !
0	learnt my lesson now .
0	will not be back !
0	we bought 0 pcs from this birmingham based company and when they came the internal parts like motherboards , ram and power units were not as_described .
0	we were sent £_00 motherboards instead of £_000 ones and the ram was not even paired .
0	do not buy from them !
0	they may be competitively_priced but you will not get what you think you are buying inside your pc !!
0	of course they did not want to know at all and ignored all contact .
0	avoid
0	i used gak twice , and both_times the order was fulfilled and delivered the next_day .
0	packaging of the goods is very professional and the items arrived in perfect_condition .
0	highly_recommended !
0	ordered a guitar case and all went perfectly fine .
0	i really liked the option to fast checkout without registration , paying with paypal .
0	great supplements great pricing and no headaches .
0	awesome job !
0	i love the speed in which you provide the unlock .
0	it '_s unbelievable compared to other services i '_ve_used , and i '_m very satisfied with the results .
0	i hope this service stays running for years to come !
0	very very very fast shipping , great prices that on one can beat .
0	i love them !
0	i will come_back again and again !
0	excellent - only thing was delivery but it was easter so i understand .
0	this is the first time i '_ve_used printing . com and the guys in cheadle , the design the guys produced and the quality of the leaflets were excellent and i am very happy with the job .
0	i will_definitely use printing . com again and would recommend them to all .
0	due to the cash injection i can now grow the business as required , thank_you funding_circle
0	ordered extra large bouquet of gerberas with chocolates to be delivered for the wife from the kids on mothers_day , no chocolates delivered , wrong flowers , what i got was disgusting , no value for money and when i spoke to customer_services i was told they ran_out of flowers and substituted the gerberas for thistles and it was their right to do that , my wife was horrified at what i ' d bought !
0	done not use , get a £ 0 bunch from tesco '_s garage its a better value for money !!!!
0	!
0	i '_m always very sceptical of reviews .
0	were they written by the company ?
0	will it be ok for me ?
0	well , i had no_problems_whatsoever with mazuma .
0	i looked at several sites , some of which offered a fair bit more money .
0	but since mazuma has_been well advertised and seemed more ' legit ', i went with them .
0	valuation was easy .
0	the bag came the next_day .
0	i popped my phone in and sent it off .
0	the next_day i had the money in my account !
0	bosh !
0	easy_peasy .
0	i ' d have no_qualms about using them again .
0	product was delivered straight_away by email and was as advertised .
0	very quick and easy .
0	recommended !
0	i '_ve placed many orders with tredz over the past few_years , and every time their service and delivery times have been second to none .
0	almost every time they have been at_least equal to the cheapest cost of products compared to elsewhere , and delivery is free .
0	i '_m at the stage now where even if they aren_'_t the cheapest , i ' d prefer to pay a little_bit extra and get it from tredz as i know what i '_m getting .
0	i only order from companies based on their reviews so it '_s only fair i play my part .
0	prices for the items i ordered were the best online , and the delivery was reasonable still meant they were cheapest .
0	quick delivery so it has to be a five_star_rating from me .
0	i '_m not usually one for leaving reviews , however since i usually rely so heavily on using reviews others have left i thought in this instance i should make a contribution .
0	pvgc0 are yet to have a review showing through google_shopping , but such was the service i have just had they deserve my time to write this review which i hope will convince others to purchase .
0	instead i found myself reviewing this website and looking for other evidence of them being a reputable_company ( new facebook_page ).
0	no need i received top service at a good price , could not be more happy with the transaction .
0	i '_ve only ordered the one item . it was delivered very swiftly .
0	the site was so easy to use .
0	a first_class service
0	very easy to process , got the key within 00_minutes and with no_problems what so ever
0	was looking to buy civ 0 to play over the summer_holiday and i was shocked to see how much steam ask you to pay for it .
0	then i found this site , cheap and i reviewed the code within 0 minutes .
0	i ordered a book , through amazon_prime , to arrive today .
0	however after waiting in all day , no parcel .
0	amazon are moaning_about dpd , i will never use you again .
0	royal_mail
0	i was a bit_skeptical_about cjs at first , so before buying anything i carefully read the description and comments and then finally bought battlefield_0 in a split second i got my key , and to my surprise the site was actually legit .
0	just a couple days ago i bought two copies of saint row 0 and i literally wasted the whole day playing that awesome game with my brother .
0	cjs seriously offer great prices and fast services overall , i recommend .
0	i made an order 0nd_july on some shoes .
0	they werent in stock but were supposed to be shipped to golfstoreeurope within 0 - 0 days .
0	it has_gone 0 working_days and my order havent been shipped or taken_care of .
0	i ´_m waiting ...
0	i '_ve sold a couple of phones to mazuma and have had brilliant service both_times .
0	the reply package arrived within a couple of days of placing the orders and the money was in my bank_account within a day of them receiving it in their office .
0	seriously , i have have never bought a game and 0 seconds later been able to play ot , you always have to wait for hours and / or days to finally get it but cjs_cd_keys are amazing .
0	i ordered my game today and literally 0 seconds later the key is there and ready to use .
0	it is so easy to setup an order and no waiting is required !
0	!
0	from now on , i am buying most , if not all of my games here !
0	thank_you cjs_cd_keys !
0	i was a little_concerned when i read the small_print , that when they receive your phone they may not pay the full price if they find any_issues with it .
0	however , i needn_'_t have worried as i received the full quoted amount .
0	the whole_transaction was so easy !
0	they sent me an envelope , i popped the phone into it and posted it to them .
0	they emailed me to tell me it had arrived .
0	they emailed me again to say that they had processed it and would pay me the full_amount on a specifed date via my chosen payment_method , paypal .... and they did !
0	perfect !
0	i would definitely recommend to anyone .
0	we are an online_retailer .
0	we send over 0 , 000 parcels a week a large_proportion of which are sent via interlink_express .
0	others are sent via_tnt and royal_mail .
0	over the years we '_ve trialled pretty_much every_single next_day small parcel national courier company operating in the uk ( ukmail , city_link , dhl etc ) so i feel that what follows is a qualified review .
0	perhaps moreso than the ( understandably ) aggrieved recipients of parcels delivered by interlink who '_ve been unlucky_enough to experience poor service on the sole occasion that they '_ve come into contact with interlink .
0	for starters , no one is perfect .
0	interlink lose parcels too , but — from a retailer '_s point of view — they really work hard to resolve the issue and have retained a personal_approach despite growing significantly over the last few_years .
0	for example , if we have a missing parcel case that can '_t be resolved by tracking online then we make a call to our local_depot who are able to contact the delivery driver directly to get further information , regardless of location .
0	this has frequently enabled_us to resolve missing parcel cases in a matter of minutes .
0	just to put this into perspective , if we have a missing parcel sent via_tnt then we have to contact a national call_centre and speak to a customer service rep who opens an investigation and promises ( on a good day ) a call back within 0 hours .
0	if we ' re lucky_enough to receive a call back within 0 hours , it '_s usually only to tell us that they ' re still investigating .
0	tnt are slow and impersonal by comparison and it leaves us twiddling our thumbs while our customer gets more and more angry .
0	i know interlink is francised so i '_m not sure how our local_depot service differs from other areas but i trust that interlink are established enough to ensure that standards remain high amongst all their francises .
0	on the rare_occasion that interlink has completely lost one of our parcels ( just once in the last 00 months ) we are able to make claims for the loss quickly and easily .
0	by comparison , we also send a large_volume of parcels via_royal_mail tracked which , despite_being a tracked service , results in a much larger number of missing items .
0	we currently have 00 outstanding claims with royal_mail dating from november ' 00 to january ' 00 and the claims process for royal_mail is unbelievably complicated and undoubtedly designed to put most people off from claiming for missing items .
0	the number of things required to make a successful claim from royal_mail is utterly mind_boggling ; we ' re_talking supplier invoices to prove product purchase prices as well as copies of all scanned collection manifests and evidence of posting .
0	royal_mail then send a letter to our customer asking them to confirm that an item they ordered has not been delivered .
0	the customer needs to respond in writing to confirm this .
0	of course , in the mean time we '_ve sent out a replacement item to ensure that the customer is happy and , as such , the customer will likely disregard the royal_mail letter .
0	if royal_mail don_'_t receive a response from the customer , they don_'_t pay compensation to us .
0	it '_s an utterly_ridiculous situation .
0	the best thing about interlink however is their technology .
0	next_day parcel delivery is a competitive business and all the big_players are constantly raising the bar by introducing new parcel tracking features that make it easier for our customers to know when to expect their parcel .
0	interlink are top of the pile in terms of this technology though .
0	our customers get emails and text_messages with estimated delivery times to within 0 hour .
0	customers are able to rearrange delivery for another day or ask the driver to leave with a neighbour all via their phone or computer without having to contact us .
0	customers can even track the delivery van online to see exactly when their delivery is due .
0	whilst the majority of the big courier companies are aiming towards this level of service , i don_'_t believe that any have so_far achieved what interlink have done both in terms of features and implementation .
0	all our customers receive nicely_designed responsive html delivery notification emails from interlink that contain our company logo and details of tracking_number and delivery time .
0	i '_ve seen what ukmail and city_link are doing by comparison and it '_s nowhere_near as smooth .
0	in summary , i would strongly encourage retailers to trial interlink .
0	been with sagepay since january_0000 .
0	more and more often the service is going down which leads to failed transaction after failed transaction .
0	incredibly damaging to our business , not because we lose the immediate sale but because we lose the confidence of the customer altogether .
0	the service failed in early march , it '_s now failed again ( mid march ).
0	as i '_m writing this i '_ve watched over 00 failed transactions rack up via our admin panel .
0	take mine and everyone_else '_s advice here .
0	don_'_t use sagepay .
0	we ' re moving to a more reliable payment provider as soon as possible .

0	was as_described and of a very high_standard quality .
0	i did next_day delivery and had my cummerbund and tie in less_than 00_hours after ordering .
0	... with a quicker_than_expected turnaround .
0	the amount in which these_guys have moved forward in the last 0 years ; from the time i ordered my desktop from pcspecialist to almost a month_ago now , if i find myself needing more machines , i '_ll come here .
0	i have on my lap a balanced , powerful machine for a particularly affordable price .
0	easy site to find all the latest mobile_phone deals on .
0	wouldn_'_t recommend this lot to deliver anything ever again .
0	reason being we ordered 0 days before the selected delivery date to an international address for a birthday_present .
0	to my horror , the flowers did not arrive .
0	looking on the order tracking from dpd , the order was picked_up in the evening before the selected date and arrived into the country being delivered to at 0pm that day .
0	the flowers then sat in the warehouse all weekend .
0	the customer service response refused to accept anything of their wrongdoing and blamed it solely on dpd with the message attached being , ' we don_'_t guarantee international_deliveries '.
0	having looked into the order tracking more closely .
0	the flowers were sent on the most basic option dpd offer , which on the dpd website specifically state that all deliveries will be made within 0 - 0 working_days .
0	considering the flowers departed the point of origin late_afternoon the day before , there wasn_'_t a hope in hell the flowers arriving on the date selected .
0	when trying to explain that point to prestige_flowers , the person_who responded couldn_'_t quite grasp the obvious and still refused to accept any liability .
0	i asked for a manager to call me to discuss my complaint and i '_m still_waiting for that response .... 0 days and counting .
0	the matter has now been raised to trading_standards and raised a dispute on the payment via my credit_card company .
0	lesson to be learnt - prestige_flowers can '_t be trusted and with the standard of customer service received , don_'_t deserve to be in business .
0	love this matress , very comfortable , nice and thick , love the zipped cover , and now i get great nights_sleep , also good value for money
0	great quality , massive detail difference on my seperates hifi , more powerful bass , mid and treble , would recomend to anyone .

0	i recently_purchased a preowned omega_seamaster planet_ocean 0000 . 00 . 00 from watchfinder . co . uk .
0	it took me a lot of time to commit to an online company to buy such and expensive item but after looking through loads of forum sites i decided on watchfinder .
0	all i can say is from_start to finish the service was brilliant from my initial_enquiry to the dispatch of the watch .
0	the watch came as good as new with a replacement bezel and glass fitted and all the things included that you would expect .
0	i dealt_with jade mainly and she made the whole_experience very easy .
0	all in all a reputable_company that i for one will_definitely be dealing_with again .
0	all items were delivered very quickly , even_though i had a problem with one of the amps hifi - towers were really apologetic and gave_me a small refund as a gesture of good will and delivered my replacement amp in the same week !
0	amazing !
0	there customer service is top_class and will_defiantly use them again !
0	thanks so much !
0	went well .
0	no_dramas .
0	i don_'_t want to start on a bad note , as the product quality and fitment of what we bought from hillarys was very good , but during the installation unfilortunately there was accidental danae caused_by their engineer .
0	mistake was that he moved the bed without really checking it , which resulted_in one of the support beams breaking .
0	we promptly contacted hillarys to let them know that this unintentional mistake was made by one of their employees , and that it where it all went_downhill ...
0	after 0 phone_calls explain that there was no way that this damage was there prior to their visit ( the bed was 0_weeks old , brand_new & hand assembled by myself !!!)
0	and 0 emails , they were denying to the absolute that they were not responsible .
0	so the products that hillarys sell are not why they got 0_star , it is the awful way they dealt_with a situation caused_by them , and in that on it '_s own is why we would never use , recommend ... or even deal in any way shape or form with hillarys and encourage anyone who_reads this to do the same !
0	!
0	ordered quite a few products from oakfurnitaureland over the last few_months , and have to say that the quality and promptness of their service was first_class !
0	when our bed developed a fault a few weeks after receiving it ( not the company '_s fault , but a defect with a knot in the wood , but defects with handmade products aren '' t a massive surprise !
0	), but the way that oakfurnitureland dealt_with the matter was great .
0	we were offered either a fairly sizeable compensation package , or a replacement , which we opted for the latter .
0	so all in all , oakfurnitureland , you '_ve done a great job , and keep it up , because it '_s so hard to get good service from these large businesses nowadays !
0	i ordered 0 items from shopto . net on 00th_july and i found it very unreliable i received 0 item and when i tried to query 0 missing items after 0_weeks i found it very difficult to contact them .
0	i had to submit a query under the wrong subject to get a response from an advisor .
0	i don_'_t think the advisors were very understand because i explained 0 item was received in 0 days and you claim they all got dispatched at the same time / place so why wont you investigate this as lost items .
0	then they had the cheeky to advise me to buy an instant code from them instead in the mean time ( so buying the item twice in effect until they refunded me )
0	i would recommend shopping through amazon because they have competitive_prices and are always reliable .
0	hostelbookers is very easy to use and a little cheaper_than hostelworld .
0	will be using for booking all our hostels .
0	quick and safe transaction .

0	ordered the pump on friday_morning and it arrived monday .
0	it arrived in the actually pump box which was mis shaped , when i opened up the pump had been rolling around in the box due to cardboard holder in side being lose .
0	probably wouldn_'_t of happening if the box was packaged in another with bubble_wrap or something .
0	in this case the pump was ok but why risk it !
0	being in the heating industry and wanting to find a new supplier , i tried plumb_nation , ordering was simple , products came on time .
0	since then i have placed a further two orders , both orders again on time .
0	brilliant service keep it up .

0	had an issue with the first cable i ordered but gemma had a replacement sent out which i received the next_day .

0	i recently went to spain and managed to tot up £_000 of roaming_charges ( unknown to me , some how ).
0	when i got back and found this out i explained the situation and they let_me off ( thank_god ).
0	they aslo told me next time i go abroad i should get texts letting_me know when i hit certain spends on data .
0	great service 00 !
0	first time i have ever felt the need to review a company - i ordered at 00 : 00 on friday so just missed the cut_off for next_day delievery ( which as i paid £_00 . 00 for my bracket im not to worried_about next_day ) bracket arrived in perfect order and fits my tv perfectly .
0	yes its wednesday so 0 full working_days since my order but as tilting brackets for 00 " tv '_s usually go for around £_000 ... who_cares ?
0	not exeptional service but by no means aweful .
0	maybe if i were a more anal person i would be concerned_about my tv bracket being a couple of days late .
0	it '_s cheap , it works , who_cares ?
0	we ( kpp search ) recently engaged with pd to re - desgin our website .
0	their level of service throughout was excellent .
0	specifically , we always had the comfort that pd '_s design team were available for feedback and a quick_turnaround on our requests .
0	i wish the team at pd continued_success .
0	i ordered a skin for my ipod_touch ( 0th_gen ), xbox 000s and controller .
0	very quick service .

0	i '_m not very good at applying these sort of things but theres no bubbles in these .
0	very happy !
0	i ordered a rare pair of ray_bans for my girlfriend which i couldn_'_t find anywhere instore and i even called ray - ban direct .
0	i searched the internet and found them at blaze !
0	such a result !!
0	the customer service and prompt delivery were an unexpected_surprise too , browny_points for me and big browny_points for blaze - so shopping here again !
0	awesome recommend shiply to everyone , just make_sure you read peoples feedback , use the shiplys payment system and you cant go_wrong !!!!
0	!
0	they talk you through each_step of your order from when payment is taken to the time they post it out .
0	with a huge_range of quality clothing and other accoutrement i can '_t hesitate to recommend military_0st to anyone looking for the sort of items they sell !
0	cheapest place i could_find who were stocking the winter_tyres i was after .
0	however the price is in no way reflected in the quality of service which is top_notch !
0	an easy to use website , simple ordering system and good communication_throughout !
0	will_definitely be using again and would recommend to anyone looking for parts for their bikes !
0	was a bit_wary of this place as i hadn_'_t heard of it before but after_seeing all the postive views and the excellent price for arma_0 compared to steam i decided to go for it .
0	sure_enough got my steam_key for the game within just a few minutes of ordering .
0	excellent stuff !
0	i chose viagogo over seatwave ( because a friend of mine was at the company ).
0	i purchased tickets for a concert .
0	royal_mail did not deliver the tickets due to " incomplete_address " but would not tell me what address was entered .
0	viagogo promised to call me back to resolve 0 times over a month long period .
0	eventually , viagogo refused to provide a refund even_though the seller entered an incomplete_address .
0	this is a scam .
0	people who do not have tickets simply claim to have a ticket and then send an empty envelope to an incomplete_address .
0	they get their money and the buyer is held_responsible with no refund .
0	never again .
0	waited 0 days at home for my package and everytime tracking shows " no one to receive card left ( loughborough service centre )"
0	no card left at all .
0	i called the customer service and i was told they will try again tmoorow for last time !!
0	are you kidding you can '_t even fine my home
0	delivered a replacement parcel to wrong_address then asking me to collect it from the wrong_address myself .
0	imagine knocking on some strangers door and ask them for your parcel !!
0	!
0	this site is very simple to use , everything i wanted happened .
0	same day money_transfered , good communication to summarise it up excelent site highly_recommended .
0	after having just completed another order with echo_supplements , i decided it was time to leave my opinion on their service .
0	my experience of dealing_with echo_supplements has_been outstanding .
0	they have a wide_range of products to choose from at prices that are very competitive .
0	delivery is very quick and the e_- mail / sms_updates of my delivery status , takes all the frustration of guessing what time the delivery man might appear out of the equation .
0	as i am a frequent buyer of online goods , this is a welcome_change ( i wish every company i bought goods online from did this ).
0	not to mention the next_day delivery is included free of charge when you spend more than £_00 , which i usually do anyway .
0	the hand_written compliment and free_sample is always a nice little touch .
0	many_thanks to the people at echo_supplements , keep_up the good work .
0	every time i have needed to contact thetrainline . com , i have not been left_feeling disappointed .
0	booking tickets is easy , and booking a bicycle space was just as easy !
0	ordered some trousers yesterday , delivered today !
0	just awesome service , couldn_'_t ask for anything better , thank_you guys :)
0	the suplements i get here at supplement_warehouse are 00 to 00_%_cheaper_than gnc .
0	i was just there to see if there prices droped , yea im surprized that gnc isnt out of bisness yet .
0	had the best price on the market for the reel i wanted , and delivery was very quick .
0	will be using again !
0	felt i had to comment as i was that impressed with in particular how fast i got my product .
0	i ordered mid day and first thing the next_morning it was delivered , also it was nearly the cheapest i had found the product aswel , not quite , but with the incredibly fast postage i was more than happy with my decision .
0	will be using them again no doubt in the near_future .
0	such a good way to keep_up with friends and family .
0	just opened in gillingham and the deals are incredible .
0	fifa_00 rrp 00 quid and in asda its 00 :) big store with many products
0	it took 0 days for a custom strung racket to arrive , incredible delivery time .
0	the product itself is one of the nicest rackets i have ever hit with .
0	ordering off tennis_nuts all the time , its just an incredibley good website : d
0	great prices + free p_&_p on most items .
0	one of the best on - line bike_shops they are .
0	use them all the time .
0	superb service , everything is explained in detail .
0	very nice site .
0	recommend it to all .
0	my parcel was very fast to be delivered ordered on tuesday and came on thursday no_complaints .
0	this is on of the most efficient companies i have had the pleasure of dealing_with on the internet , in my opinion the service is vastly_superior that of amazons and the prices are very competitive to boot
0	after having trouble with other larger internet companies services and pricing , i came_across this great company .
0	they offered a great price and had excellent reviews and i am very pleased that i purchased from videogamebox .
0	great price , fast delivery , in addition they kept me up to date on the status of my order .
0	what more can i say ?
0	i bought a hp nc0000 laptop a + refurbished machine , and it is exactly in the condition stated on the web_site - it '_s in a superb condition .
0	the delivery was excellent , too .
0	one fact sometimes can describe the overall condition of the machine .
0	in my case it '_s the following : when i connect a usb device , it clicks in the usb slot .
0	that '_s like new .
0	and all parts are in the same condition except for the battery , but that was stated on the website , so i was expecting this .
0	i can get a replacement battery for around £_00 , so that '_s not a big deal .
0	i '_m a heavy laptop user , but still don_'_t want to spend a lot of money on a machine .
0	i achieve good performance on these machines by using linux on them .
0	sometimes it can be a good trick to install the latest ubuntu for instance on an older machine .
0	it '_ll feel like a contemporary machine with the latest windows , for the fifth of the price .
0	-- at_least this is what i '_m doing .
0	this company is an excellent place to get the right machine for this purpose .
0	i would recommend them to anyone .
0	we now buy all of our consumables from printerland as they arrive the next_day everytime we place an order .
0	we have bought 0 printers over the last month as they are the best price at printerland .

0	received damaged item and the returns_procedure was hell !
0	calling the returns line cost me around £_00 in calls .
0	they answer straight_away on the new order line but will quickly forward you onto the returns line to rinse you entirely .
0	disgusting .
0	they use collect_plus who seem to ' lose ' the majority of their assignments .. so that didn_'_t go well .
0	eventually got refund about a month after this order .
0	wouldn_'_t recommend to my worst_enemy !
0	- get_rid of premium_rate number
0	- get_rid of collect_+
0	- actually employ some humans for the returns line
0	thieves .
0	cheap prices , easy to find what you want and you get it fast !
0	i was in the market for a pair of shoes and found a combo deal of almost_half price and free delivery on a great option .
0	following the suggestion to go up half a size i ordered a size i would not normally go for and would not have known had rock_+ run not mentioned it in the information .
0	the shoes are great and fit_perfectly !
0	in short : an unquestionably disappointing online store , with poor management , inefficient team and misleading_advertising .
0	i placed my order more than 0_weeks_ago and should have received my glasses by now ( as they have stated it takes 0 - 00 days ).
0	i emailed them on so many occasions , expressing the urgency because i ’_m leaving the country , yet i did not get any email from their customer service nor the management_team ( as they have stated it takes maximum 00_hours to reply ).
0	it is absolutely frustrating when dealing_with this store as they don_’_t have a contact number on the website nor they are efficient in replying to emails whatsoever .
0	i don_’_t even know whether this company exists or not .
0	they give you their words but they fail to deliver their promise .
0	there is nothing wrong with the whole purchasing process taking more than 00 days , but they should not advertise themselves as capable of delivering the goods to the customer ’_s door within 00 days when they clearly cant .
0	saying its peak_season or what ever reason is not a good enough reason because they should have taken that into account .
0	consider i ordered 0 pair of glasses last_year from 0 different websites , this is absolutely by far the worst experience i ’ ve had so_far .
0	since they are not replying to any of my email , i am giving them this review to give them 0 days to reply and update me on my purchase / giving me proper arrangement .
0	if not , i will consider further actions .
0	i broke my iphone and ipad in 0 week , they collected it on the monday and i had both back to me by the thursday .
0	i was incredibly happy with what i received back and would recommend them to anyone i know .
0	craig
0	it seems as if the vast_majority of people have the same experience with first_utility .
0	i can not stress enough that you should not use them .
0	we had to use them when we moved in to a new build flat in march_0000 , and i can_honestly_say that since then we have to phone them about twice a month , which costs money every time as they do not have a freephone_number and the minimum time on hold every call is about 00minutes .
0	nothing which they have done since they started supplying us has_been correct .
0	and do not fall in to the trap of thinking that because you have spoken to someone on the phone and agreed something that this will be acted on or recorded in any way .
0	and do not worry_about emailing - they will not reply .
0	i can not begin to list all of the issues we have had as there has_been so many - it has caused endless stress over the last 00 months .
0	there '_s always little problems with energy_suppliers but this has_been nothing but constant problems since we have been using them .
0	you have been_warned .
0	well , what can i say .
0	the branded version of fluconazole , canesten , retails at around £_00 for one capsule , and the un - branded version around £ 0 .
0	i got three for £ 0 . 00 including delivery from pharmacy first - amazing !
0	we had already decided to replace the flooring throughout our new home when we purchased as it was a mix of colours and textures , some of which was 00 years old and threadbare in places .
0	although my partner and i are thrifty , upcycling and doing work ourselves , we would never recommend scrimping on carpet and underlay as it is not something one would like to be replacing on a regular_basis .
0	we read_reviews of various underlays and decided to go with the ' cirrus ' by cloud 0 .
0	when we spoke to the store that was supplying our carpet , they told us they could supply cloud 0 ... great , we thought , until they told us the price was £_00 sqm !
0	we knew carpet underlay shop was able to supply it in complete rolls and cut lengths which worked out to under £ 0 sqm , a rather large saving i '_m_sure you '_ll agree .
0	they even had a promotion running which included a small pack of gripperods ... fantastic as we found the rear of the lounge was missing them for some reason .
0	the whole_process from ordering to delivery was smooth and we would certainly do custom with carpet underlay shop again as and when we require .
0	we '_ve already_recommended them to family and friends , and we highly_recommend them to the public as well !

0	i '_ve been using american sweets (_aka the stateside candy co .) for quite some time now and i '_m sorry to say my general feelings towards the company have become rather negative .
0	the major_issue i have with the company is that almost every time i place an order i find that when i open my parcel there are multiple items missing as they , according to the company , have become out - of - stock ( or in some circumstances were found broken in the warehouse ) since placing the order .
0	they seriously need to look in to how they can improve their ordering system as it '_s quite disgusting paying £ 0 . 00 for delivery of a parcel with at_least 00_% of it '_s expected contents missing .
0	next in line is that the price of clearance items can drop quite sudden and dramatically , and i have contacted them about this before after i placed an order only to find that three items had been reduced in price by 00_% overnight .
0	their response was simply " your parcel has_been dispatched and therefore we can amend any prices ".
0	finally their customer service skills are lacking somewhat .
0	i '_ve contacted them several_times over the year and the tone of the e_- mails ( usually responded to by emma baker ) are rather abrupt , that is if they ' re not ignored completely .
0	from reading the reviews of this company by other customers , it seems that all have complaints of a similar nature , and i would highly advise the director to take these issues onboard if they wish to keep customers .
0	before i finish , i just remembered that on my last order which had items ' out - of - stock ', the items were refunded ( as i requested ) but the refund was issued by cash enclosed inside an envelope - which i think speaks_volumes about their professionalism , or lack of .
0	i came_across the evaq0 website whilst looking for ' hot cans '.
0	i must_say i '_m suitably_impressed by their range and highly competitive_prices ( they were at_least £ 0 cheaper ), not to mention their delivery prices were reasonable too and weren_'_t inflated to recoupe any difference in product prices .
0	at the time they were offering free delivery and their customer_services were second - to - none when i couldn_'_t get the code to work .
0	i would highly_recommend taking a look at this company !
0	youtube offers a wealth video_clips that range from informative , funny , helpful , all the way to down - right weird !
0	i personally love the informative side of youtube .
0	if there '_s anything you '_ve ever wanted to know more about out , or how to do , you can find it here .
0	for example , we ' re currently renovating our home and found multiple videos which explained how to plaster - skim walls , which appeared simplier in video that it read in text .
0	my partner and i booked a diy holiday for may this year , and after much internet trawling we booked the flights and car_hire via ebookers despite reading mixed_reviews .
0	everything_went well at first until we received our itinerary via e_- mail .
0	upon_inspection we noticed that the ' special meal ' that had been ordered for one of our travellers had been assigned to another traveller .
0	this , we thought , would be no problem to amend , and with the details provided by ebookers we should be able to login to our flight booking through the airlines website and make the changes there .
0	we were able to login to the airlines website , but soon realised that the ' special meal ' was not the only error .
0	they , ebookers , had jumbled up the passport details for each traveller and so we had to go through and amend all the details .
0	we thought that was the end of this , however , soon after we received an e_- mail from ebookers stating that we needed to provide them with passport details .
0	we responded to their e_- mail_stating that this had been done following the booking and that we have had to also amend them via the airlines website .
0	ebookers responded stating that we must give the details as per their policy , of which we did , but ... a month later after a routine check or the airlines website , we found that ebookers had jumbled the passports details and ' special meal ' again !
0	this happend three_times before we travelled , and in addition to this , the airlines scheduled departure times changed and ebookers failed to update us with this information .
0	it was only due to checking with the airline that we were informed of these changes .
0	the hassle that ebookers caused was certainly not worth the £_00 per passenger that we saved .
0	therefore we can_honestly_say that we will not be using ebookers in the near_future , sorry .
0	there is nothing more to say other than i love google .
0	it has remained my preferred search_engine ( and default homepage ) since i first discovered it .
0	the reason_why i love google is because of its minamilistic homepage and the innovative use of the ' google ' logo at times , speed of search_results , and integration with various applications i use .
0	ebay is a fantastic way of selling your unwanted items , and has a treasure_trove of items that you may just want to spend your new income on .
0	the process is easy and there are numerous ways of which you can send / receive payments for items ( the most common being paypal ).
0	ebay , of course , do request a percentage of your items revenue for using their services and there are add - ons to enchance your listings at an additional_charge .
0	having recently sold items on ebay ( after a few_years abscence ) i must comment that the charges seems to have been increased_significantly ( around 00_% of final auction price ) and this did come as a bit of a shock .
0	i '_ve collected a fair_amount of ex - contract mobiles over the years , and having seen the catchy mazuma_mobile advertistment on tv i thought i ' d give the service a try .
0	i must comment on how extremely easy the whole_process was from_start to finish , and how mazuma_mobile send you regular e_- mail updates as to where you order currently stands .
0	i would definately_use their services again .
0	this website was very easy to navigate and had every thing i need .
0	i really appreciated the information that came along with the products and the coupons that they make available to us !
0	great overall !
0	first time customer of ray_grahams , i bought a milwaukee m00 fuel compact cordless percussion drill 00 volt m00cpd - 000c , great service 0 days to deliver from ireland for free .
0	very competitively_priced and exellent quality drill .
0	fast service
0	my laptop hard_drive had died on me and i was in need of a replacement fast , as usual i checked aria and all it '_s competitors for the best replacement product and found quite a few of aria '_s competitors had the drive i wanted , all priced similarly .
0	however , i choose to go with aria as they offer free next_day delivery with dpd for loyal_customers , this was the first time i had used aria '_s new carrier and they did not let_me down .
0	i got the replacement on time , undamaged and it worked a treat .
0	to add the price was one of the cheapest out there .
0	i would definitely recommend aria again as i '_ve been shopping with them for over 0 years_now and they have not let_me down to date , infact they get better each time :).
0	has all of the major_brands at great prices and if you shop around and find a lower price they will easily adjust theirs to keep you happy by just entering in the website and price .
0	will_continue to shop_here as this is my third order .
0	sunce that scumbag american_football player died of dehydration after taking a crapload of ephedrine and didn_'_t drink enough water , this lively supplement has_been banned or terribly hard to find in the states .
0	they have it here .
0	i '_m ecstatic .
0	my job depends on my weight and athletic ability and you just can '_t top ephedra supplements .
0	i ordered a rabbit run at 0 :_00pm and it arrived the next_morning at 0am !
0	absolutely outstanding service and item was cheap compared to other_sites .
0	i will_definitely use again .
0	thanks !
0	this website is the best if you want cheap games and if you dont want to wait for them long
0	after_searching the web for any possible way to unlock my iphone i came up to this site .
0	i wasn_'_t sure if it was the real deal or just another fake .
0	i gave it a try and the result was an unlocked at & t iphone_0s the next_day .
0	the only_downside is the cost of their service in for some carriers .
0	i will surely be using their service again . 0000 % positive .
0	it is really , unlocked my iphone 0 that was locked to swisscom version 0 . 0 . 0 . very good job thank_you recommend to everyone .
0	brilliant service and products
0	super_fast dispatch
0	cant find fault with the website ..
0	secure and did the job what it is build for .
0	ebookers is an awsome website .. and is so easy to use and completely user_friendly ..
0	ordered a rhodia notebook as an_alternative to moleskine .
0	the paper is more prone to ink smears but better quality , so i have just changed pen and for the price is really a good deal .
0	always is also good to support competitor brands
0	i had talk_talk and when moving in to a new flat i was enticed by my landlord to have virgin_media , " as a reconnection with talktalk would be to expensive ".
0	later i found out the the jerk got a 00 £ credit on his virginmedia connection so he could sat all day masturbating .
0	when setting_up the contract i haven_'_t read anywhere that by asking for a phoneline service , i would also need to buy a phone .
0	i bought a regular one , that didn_'_t work , and customer service tell me it should be a virgin phone , i didn_'_t bought it .
0	oh_yea , and if you don_'_t have a virgin phone service (+ virgin phone ) you will be burning parts of your brain and wallet , frustrating with customer service , since the thing looks set_up to make it really difficult : the machine asks for area code , some 0 or 0 passwords , and some more shit , " to make the service faster ".
0	true to be said , i have wasted more that 00 £ trying to cancel the phone service , which i couldn_'_t so i had to stick with it for 0 months .
0	now , let_me tell about the broadband in one word - its shit .
0	i mean , i never had a service who blocked so many websites , i had to learn how to counter act this with proxys and other it technicalities so i could download what i wanted ( yes i know that copyright infringement is though for the companies to accept that has its own benefits ).
0	the connection was good and reached the speeds that they sell lets say .. 0 times in one year .
0	on prime time , i couldn_'_t even watch youtube .
0	also i had 0 periods of 0 hours straight with no connection .
0	yes i could spent other 00 £ phoning them to fix it but i chose to wait , you can guess why .
0	oh , and the letters they send , so funny .
0	" we noticed that you like to download , specially in the evening ".
0	is that really a good marketing move on your clients ?
0	first , its really great to feel being spied on .
0	second , i can '_t even watch a 0min video on evenings , not to talk about downloads that i can '_t even reach the websites to make them ...
0	and last but not least ...
0	i changed house again , and wanted to bring virgin along with me since i had 0 months left in the contract ... and i find out that if i wanted to bring them with me ( yea , romantic i know ) i would had to re - contract for more 00 months , and pay some fees ..
0	i chose to disconnect , and i was also asked to pay for a disconnection fee .. lol .
0	today i find out that they are charging me for paper handling_fees , when i signed_up for a direct_debit to prevent them for sucking more money out of me 0_0 it has reached a point that is incomprehensible to me .
0	by the way virgin_media ...
0	i '_m using your service that i payed to write this .
0	and i will also prevent everyone close to me to spend 0 cent with you .
0	this is actually a thing that i can do with your connection , type text .
0	wow .
0	im going back to talktalk again , not sure if its the best but at_least i had nothing to bother when i had it .
0	and fuck you virgin , honestly .
0	found all the information i needed from the website to make a decision on what product was best for me .
0	rang the technical_department to check i ' d made the right choice !
0	all staff i spoke to were helpful and when i placed the order delivery came quickly and well_packed .

0	when i have to order supplements online , i always go to supplement_warehouse .
0	they have pretty_much every supplement on the market and the best part about it is that they let you price match their competitors !
0	aside from that awesomeness ....
0	they ship right away and the service is excellent !

0	myprotein now no_longer responds to emails , and if you '_ve tried getting through via the telephone - good luck , it '_s a full time job in itself .
0	used to be an ace company but no_longer .
0	real_shame .

0	great product and very good customer service ; unlike myprotein they deliver , answer the phone and respond promptly to emails .
0	great stuff .
0	tried to deliver twice , then inexplicably decided to return to depot - thirty miles_away - rather_than drop_off at local post_office - 00 metres away .
0	i then completed the form asking for the parcel to be re - delivered to my local post_office .
0	didn_'_t arrive .
0	this was my first order from aria since they changed delivery company to dpd .
0	the service is so much_better now and lets you know when the delivery will be arriving .

0	i purchased couple of cricket equipments from barrington_sports recently and the service received was brilliant and hassel_free .
0	i had to return 0 item and then i noticed that it was free to do so via click and collect .
0	this is an amazing service and takes care of all that additinal expense of returning your product if it is not suitable which happens when it comes to internet purchases .
0	delivery of the product and refund of the item returned was done promptly so no_complaints there .
0	overall a great shopping_experience .
0	people have started making money out of everything .
0	even if it means by selling your personal details .
0	this is one of such sites .
0	i have faxed them to remove my details ( it is very hard to get through to the fax line ) and still they haven_'_t removed my details off the website .
0	i was informed that if you don_'_t opt_out while updating the electoral register these companies buy your details and sell it to whoever pays the money .
0	they provide your
0	name
0	address
0	other occupants
0	electoral roll
0	length of occupancy
0	neighbours
0	property price
0	of course for a fee .
0	don_'_t even bother buying this product manufactured by this company as it is such a waste of money .
0	i purchased this 0 years back and registered for warranty .
0	first 0 months went well then the problems started .
0	console was changed 0 times as it kept on blowing up .
0	first they told me it is the adaptor i am using and when i informed them i purchased the adaptor from them they didn_'_t have much to say .
0	after the third blow out they finally decided that there is a problem and send out an engineer .
0	i had to wait for 0 months for engineer_visit as the parts were not available due to a warehouse move .
0	after the engineer_visit i noticed that the right pedal cracked .
0	i reported this fault to the company and a very rude lady from their customer_support ( icon health and fitness ) informed me it is my fault .
0	i called back after couple of days to complain and one nice gentleman was kind enough to send me a replacement free of charge when the other staff_member i spoke to was ready to charge me £_00 for the same .
0	i tried to fix the pedal when i realised the welding connecting the leg of the machine has come off and at this point i gave up .
0	dismantled the product and dumped it in a " ecofit " way .
0	£_000 down the drain .
0	please don_'_t waste your money join a gym or buy a better equipment which works .
0	please_note that you need to register for extended free warrenty else you will miss out plus end up paying more for repairs which will happen for sure .
0	emirates is an airline which stands_out from others .
0	their long_haul and short haul flights have excellent facilities , entertainment and service .
0	i have travelled with them many_times and each time had a great experience .
0	competition is tightening up in the industry and they have to start keeping up with qatar_airways .
0	a000 is an amazing flight with two decks .
0	first_class and business class facilities are amazing and the economy is not bad at all .
0	extra_legroom and better entertainment_system ( ice ) serves you well .
0	first change ( unless you are travelling on a specially discounted ticket ) is free and chargable after that .
0	this has come in handy couple of times but i should mention that airline is very accomadating .
0	wish most of the airlines provided similar service .
0	i was really happy with the service i received from currys .
0	i went into stevenage branch of currys to buy a cheap windows 0 laptop but walked out with and apple_imac .
0	sales_person was really good .
0	credit where it is due .
0	he had good product knowledge and he did convince me to try out imac .
0	i was completely new to snow lepord and i have never used it before as i was a big_fan of microsoft ( till the day i started_using imac ).
0	imac was pricey but you get what you pay for .
0	coming_back to the point of service it was excellent .
0	since then i have visited currys for other purchases and also recommended couple of friends .
0	it is nice to see that service provided by this supermarket is great .
0	staff is friendly and helpful .
0	they also have a price match and voucher scheme which works out great .
0	strong contender when it comes to fuel prices as well .
0	i have two holidays with this company and the first one was a breeze .
0	las_vegas trip worked out cheap compared to the deals i was getting during the time .
0	recently i booked two_days break for dublin and that experience was interesting .
0	i checked the details online and was about to book online .
0	as we were a party of six i decided to call up the call_centre .
0	i got through to an overseas call_centre and managed to find the deal i was looking for .
0	i explained to the agent that we were a party of 0 and the money will be paid on two cards .
0	i admit that agent was very accommodating and explained the first card payment will be 00_% of the total and the second will be 00 %.
0	i informed her that i am not happy with this and she agreed that it will be fine to pay for 0 people on one card and 0 on the other .
0	all prices and flight times were agreed and booking continued .
0	when it came to processing payment whatever i explained about paying for 0 people on one card went out of the window .
0	she quoted 00_% of the charge .
0	as we were back to square one i explained what i wanted again .
0	agent informed me that it should be done as 0 booking .
0	once the second booking was created we carried on with the payment .
0	before processing the payment the agent informed me the amount she will be deducting of the card and asked my permission .
0	i agreed as everything was correct .
0	i was waiting for the first payment to be processed she came back on the phone and informed me that the prices have gone up .
0	i was a bit_confused and questioned it .
0	the agent informed me that she works on a live system and prices can change .
0	i informed her that i am not happy about this as you were just about to take payment for a agreed_amount .
0	she informed me that there is nothing she can do and even a manager cant help .
0	i informed her that i was disappointed with the service but " i cant do anything was the reply ".
0	i was not happy about this so i decided to book it via expedia website .
0	i found that the rates were the same as before and nothing different .
0	while entering the details of the passenger i noticed that the agent had spelt one of the passengers name wrong which i was not happy about as this would have coasted us more if it needed to be changed later .
0	i entered correct information and continued with the booking .
0	once the booking was at payment page .
0	the price changed and came to the amount agent mentioned on the phone .
0	i noticed that the difference in price was only £ 0 per person which the agent failed to mention .
0	on the positive_side we didn_'_t end up paying extra to change passenger spelling .
0	personally i feel that they should have adjusted the fluxuating rate after the price was agreed which would have been the real expedia experience ( they would have gained that additional 0_stars )
0	positive
0	easy to use website , good deals , no credit_card charge .
0	negative
0	overseas call_centre was a let_down both on quality and service .
0	rates can fluxuate so until last_minute you wont know how much you are paying .
0	we booked a hawaii cruise and las_vegas stay with this company and to start with everything was fine .
0	we got a reasonable deal and the agent was helpful .
0	i requested a call back over the weekend to put down the deposit but agent asked me to call back .
0	i was surprised that agent didn_'_t try and secure the deal like other travel_agents i spoke to on the same day but took it as a positive of no pressure_sales_tactics .
0	i called them back after the weekend and put down £_000 deposit .
0	all details were taken down and booking went through fine .
0	as mentioned earlier agent provided all the necessary details and his experience reflected in his answers to my questions .
0	please_note that agent and the company did make it clear that if i decide to cancel my holiday i will loose the deposit so they have done this by the book .
0	after couple of months i had a family problem and couldn_'_t travel on the dates .
0	i called the agent up and he informed me that he can possibly try and rearrange the cruise if i choose the same liner or can work out some deals for another cruise if i choose a different liner .
0	again i was asked to find a deal instead of the agent looking one for me .
0	i didn_'_t think much of it and couldn_'_t find anything great .
0	i called the agent back and informed that i cant find any other cruise itenary with the liner and checked about a new booking which a cruise and stay deal from hawaii .
0	agents response was " it has_been ages since i looked into a flight to hawaii but leave it with me and i will get back to you within couple of days ".
0	he asked me to email him holiday cancellation letter which i did on the same day .
0	the impression i got from the conversation was he couldn_'_t be_bothered to look around for another deal but i was happy to give him benefit of doubt .
0	i waited for a week and heard_nothing from the agent or the company .
0	after two_weeks i had one of the accounts staff call me from the company asking about rest of my holiday payment .
0	i explained that i have cancelled my holiday and emailed the agent about it .
0	i also informed the staff_member that the agent promised me a call back but i haven_'_t heard_anything .
0	the staff_member informed me that she will speak to the agent and he will call me back .
0	till this day i haven_'_t heard_anything from the agent or the company .
0	low_prices could be a result of many things ( special deals , off season etc ....) so before you jump in please check whether the weather and tourist season for the month you want to cruise .

0	transfer etc ... included
0	tips on board ( this is something you may be able to pay in advance or have to pay on board )

0	we ordered very late on a tuesday and received our order early on wednesday monring , very fast delivery .
0	on every occasion the staff have been very helpful and the product we have received is of very high_quality .
0	never had bad quality food in my life , chicken quarter pounder look like all the cheap cuts have been put in a blender to make it in to a paste then moulded in to a burger shape .
0	it was tastless and taste resembled pork .
0	tried the bbq ribs that was like chewing plastic .

0	prices beat all and shipping is fast !
0	the service was quick and the game ordered delivered in excellent condition .
0	ordered new filter media and it arrived when stated and in a good condition .
0	the compan also keeps you updated on dispatch , progress of order etc .
0	the delivery is always fast , and the online help knowledgeable and helpful .
0	my 0kg of protein came packaged in a different bag , and they quickly explained why ..
0	inside was the right stuff .
0	great shop with superb customer service .
0	responded to my every email within a few hours and the sunglasses were delivered within_00hrs with fedex .
0	check out their facebook_page for a discount and to see how active and approachable they are .
0	will shop again .
0	why is amazon using these clows is beyond my comprehension .
0	one of the delivery horrors went like this : i was told that my item would be delivered on monday , and it wasn_'_t .
0	on tuesday i call the office of hdnl and ordered for my item to be delivered on wednesday , when my gf had a day of and would be in .
0	they agreed , but the item wasn_'_t delivered !
0	my gf wasted a whole day waiting .
0	so i called on thursday asking why , and they said that the item was actually taken from the base today , a day later than agreed !
0	they phone operator couldn_'_t tell why but it was .
0	so i gave them another chance - please deliver tomorrow , on friday .
0	they said yes , and again they didn_'_t even take from the warehouse on friday .
0	absolutely_shocking , almost farcical and bordering on intentional .
0	i called the office again , and surprise_surprise - the operator again couldn_'_t explain_why the driver would not take the item out on the correct day .
0	please amazon , stop using these bunch of incompetent scamsters .
0	being initially comprehensive about a new shop for contact_lenses i rung them up and had a very informative and pleasant chat .
0	i bought my lenses immediately after and they were delivered soon .
0	will be using again .
0	i picked the cheapest delivery option and my item was delivered in 0 days , brilliant .
0	great price too .
0	recommended shop .
0	i thought they were fantastic , best price online for both items ( washing_machine and tumble_dryer ) and on top of that we got a further discount for buying multiple items .
0	a good delivery window rather_than having to wait in all day .
0	also deliver on sundays which is great !
0	highly_recommended !
0	0 pairs of pull - in underwear ordered and arrived the very next_day !
0	awesome underwear and an amazing service .
0	will be back for more when these are dirty !
0	after debating which company to chose to fit my windows , front_door and french_doors i decide to get a quote and chat with safe style , i booked in an appointment for 0pm on a thursday_afternoon , 0pm on the dot that thursday and charming salesman came round and went through everything , and i mean everything , there was no question he could not answer and was not only informative but understanding and helpful .
0	i decided to chose safe style and after locking in my final price , i had booked my fitting date that day .
0	i was kept up to date with everything that was happening and even managed to bring the installation day forward by 0_weeks .
0	on the day of fitting i was told 0 - 0 men would arrive between 0 - 00am , at 0 . 00am they turned_up and went straight to work .
0	all 0 men were friendly and polite and have a very professional work_ethic , they went about with the fitting with minimal disturbance and a friendly smile .
0	once all the windows , front_door and french windows were fitted i was given a check over them all before signing off on the job .
0	the finish was stunning !
0	an easy 00 out of 00 , i could not be_happier with them , straight_away on the first night i could feel the difference , my house looks 000x better felt 000x warmer and not only am i very proud to have them fitted but i feel so much more secure and safer at home .
0	i would jump at the chance to recommend safe style to anyone who '_s looking to replace any windows or doors , you would not be_happier with the overall job .
0	total pleasure !
0	to be honest if you get 00 / 00 vision from laser_eye_surgery than brilliant but sadly i did not , though i still have to keep paying for another 0 years on a service that was not completed !
0	i was told that it might not be perfect and its not .
0	all the staff were amazing and very friendly , sadly though once it was all over and the surgeon said no to a touch up laser i was left in the dark , no options given or offered .
0	i just did not get out of it what i wanted - great 00 / 00 vision .
0	if you have a so - so prescription or lower_than go for it , if your eye_sight is relatively bad than give it a miss .
0	in my opinion the best best uk game shipper out there .
0	always deliver on time if not earlier .
0	cheap , reliable and trustworthy .
0	over took shop . net in my opinion
0	i don_'_t see what everyone '_s problem is .
0	for me they we ' re fantastic .
0	they do exactly_what they say .
0	no_hiccups for me .
0	cheap reliable ahd happy overall .
0	seeing as they decreased the cost of the product by over £_00 i am very happy :) it did take a little while for them to respond , but i '_ll put that down to the fact it '_s an australian company ( i '_m british and ordered in what would be the early morning down under ).
0	the site was easy to use , once ordered the company kept me informed of my oder status and the product was fantastic
0	i had no_problems to fing required ferry till i '_ve to the point of cancellation of my booking .
0	for cancellation they charged me £_00 instantly plus lost processing fee and period for refund nearly 0_weeks .
0	direct ferried ok to use it as search_engine but still cheaper to go direct to companies , at_least you are not paying processing fee and sometimes you can find good promotion deals .
0	i ordered a nice bottle of wine to be delivered to a friend as a surprise gift , in baltimore .
0	despite requesting ( as per their delivery instructions ) to send my friend an email with delivery details , i received an email_stating that the ordered had been delivered ( 0_weeks after the order ).
0	however , upon_checking the tracking_details , it was signed for by someone completely_different .
0	my friend confirmed that they had not received the wine after i reluctantly asked .
0	so as well as the surprise being ruined , my friend then had to get involved with the dispute with wine . com , who promised to investigate and ring us back .
0	after one week they hadn_'_t phoned or emailed either myself or my friend , so i had to chase , where no record was found of the missing item .
0	this has now gone on for over a month ... wine . com are insisting that they need to speak to my friend to verify the address , despite her having_spoken to them twice .
0	on top of all of this , they had the audacity to charge me over $_00 subscription fee !!
0	now i can '_t get hold of anyone in customer_services .
0	absolutely_shocking service , the worse i have ever_experienced with any company .
0	avoid them .
0	the best of the best , forget the rest ....
0	we had been struggling with our magento stores for several weeks , with site performance struggling and our server crashing two or three_times a day .
0	it affected our business locally as well as widely online .
0	we were originally with simple servers , who couldn_'_t get to the bottom of the issue and kept suspending our service , then switched to heart servers with similar results ... all very frustrating .
0	until my brother ( after much research ) found tsohost .
0	after_speaking to their team he was tentatively convinced ( after_hearing it all before ) that they could not only get to the bottom of the issue , but optimise the server to ensure optimum performance for our magento stores .
0	their ethos : " part of this customer - focused attitude involves listening to customer comments , suggestions and concerns and acting on these wherever_possible "... needless to say , they have stuck to their word and not only delivered , but gone well beyond the call of duty , answering phone_calls up until 00pm and working into the depths of the early hours to not only resolve_issues , but implement changes to improve our sites performance .
0	it has without_doubt been the best customer service i have ever_experienced .
0	i am extremely anal in my own business about delivering the best customer service possible and must_say the tsohost team have gone well beyond my own expectations .
0	i worked for john_lewis customer service for six_years and can say that these_guys even top jl for service .
0	don_'_t hesitate to use them .
0	thank_you seb , adam , darren , dom and craig ( and the rest of the team ) for your outstanding service .
0	if_carlsberg made managed servers ....
0	supplementwarehouse . com is my favorite site to order from .
0	i would recommend this to anyone looking for supplements .

0	item arrived in a timely_manner .
0	opted for basic delivery and it arrived within 0 days
0	booked a long weekend with this company , the price was the cheapest around , the website was simple to navigate , and customer servis was on the ball .
0	just booking my second trip fantastic .
0	you dont expect big company '_s to give such a personal servis but this one does allways happy to help and very reliable .
0	called bt to talk about my bill , all i got was a woman that could speak hardly_any english and didnt understand what information i was asking for
0	could not fault them in any way , they wher easy to use , quick on delivery and good with payment .
0	00 out of 00
0	the prices are great compared to stores .
0	i used to shop certain stores for all my products and now i know what i need i shop 000_% exclusively with supplementwarehouse . com .
0	great job guys !
0	got me the bench designer_glasses offer and they are fantastic value i couldnt even get bog_standard glasses from the opticians anywhere_near the price i paid for these .
0	plus quick delivery and all in perfect order .
0	0 * service .
0	i have ordered some networking tools and was surprised that even the order was placed late in the afternoon they still delivered next_day .
0	can '_t recommend zopa enough .
0	great site .
0	simple to use .
0	great rates .
0	good guys and useful ' my account '.
0	happy days .
0	great idea .
0	saving money for little_effort .
0	always happy to help with questions or problems .
0	no_brainer .
0	sign up .
0	bought some golf_shoes for an amazing price and they ' re perfect , have recommended this site to may people as prices are cheap and its legit
0	very helpful and well knowledge about the products they sell .
0	please dont buy from them
0	so many things were wrong with my order it was a joke .
0	firstly , their turn_around time of 0_weeks means nothing i waited 0_weeks for my computer before contacting them - just to be told it would take another week and they hadn_'_t even started to build it yet .
0	now 0_weeks had past , i called again ( having to be on hold for about 00_mins at my expense ) just to be told they were still working on it .
0	0_weeks_later i called up and was finally told my pc would be here within 0 days .
0	and sure_enough 0 days past with no pc .. 0 days_later however the pc finally arrived .
0	the pc was well_packaged , but that '_s the only positive comment i can make about the whole_experience .
0	the hdd wasn_'_t properly connected
0	the ram wasn_'_t installed .
0	was given the wrong cooling_system
0	who ever installed the water_cooling had no clue what they were doing , which meant i had to take it apart and put it back in properly .
0	their technical_support was useless and made me feel like i was wasting his time .
0	i gave up calling their technical_support because of having to wait on hold for 00_mins just to get no help .
0	i am never going to use this company again , and i urge you to find another company !
0	you can_rely_on xupes any day , the communication is prompt and clear , they are customer_oriented .
0	i recommend xupes as an a +++ seller .
0	i bought a new orange ' sidney ' from argos - one problem after another and very poor support - hours on the phone which at one point i was being charged for .
0	basically , the phone number on the message it sent me as the mobile number started with 00 not the uk 00 and somehow this has caused a glitch on their system - they acknowledged it was their fault but it has taken an_enormous amount of time to sort this out - and still actually not !
0	passed from one call_centre staff_member to another listening to lengthy ' option ' lists at the end of which you sometimes get cut_off or told to dial another number .
0	frustrating beyond_words , i also have a tesco mobile and when i had a problem with that it was one phone_call to an english call_centre where they immediately understood what i was talking_about and sorted it at no cost to me .
0	the indian_call_centre staff are polite but it is huge mistake to think any money is being saved when simple queries take multiple calls to sort_out because of difficulties with the finer_points of language and rather strong accents .
0	i will be sticking to using my tesco mobile as my main phone in future and really could not recommend orange at all .
0	hostelbookers made it easy for us to see exactly where we wanted to go and find places within out budget .
0	excellent
0	i don_'_t know the technicalities of why it is so , but three is the worst network when compared to ee ( 0g ), t - mobile ( 0g ) and and vodafone ( 0g ).
0	there is a mast within a mile of our office ( which is a portacabin so hardly some lead - lined fariday cage ) yet i step indoors and lose all connectivity to the outside world - often receiving texts and voicemail notifications several hours_later .
0	it '_s a shame i opted for the 00 month rather_than monthly offering as i ' d be off like a shot .
0	as many people have said , they are great on price , but their service offering leaves a lot to be desired .
0	buying our new bed hasn_'_t been the best experience , but the staff at mattressman have done what they can to help .
0	i placed an order for a super_king bed_frame and mattress and thought nothing more of it .
0	i received notification that the delivery would be made within a couple of days of placing the order and again thought nothing more .
0	when the order arrived , the driver had a helluva time getting it in the house - to be fair , i think a two man delivery would have struggled with the beast i ' d ordered .
0	as well as the challenge of getting the order in to the property - it turned_out the frame had been damaged in transit .
0	i now had two problems , a damaged order , and after getting home and evaluating the size of the mattress for myself , a mattress that was too big for the house .
0	i called up mattressman to discuss - the issue of the damaged bed was handled swiftly and a courier arranged for the following_day to deliver the spare_parts for the damaged bed_frame .
0	the lady i spoke to ( and i '_m annoyed with myself for forgetting her name ) then set about solving the problem of the massive mattress .
0	she suggested i swap the super_king for a " zip and link " mattress but the ones they had on their website were 0 - 0 times the cost of the one i had ( and that wasn_'_t cheap ).
0	she offered to speak to the manufacturer ( the british bed company ) to see if they would manufacturer a zip and link mattress for me ( as they didn_'_t do them as standard at that time ).
0	i was overjoyed to hear that the british bed company had agreed to make a zip and link mattress for us , and the premium was only an extra £_000 .
0	the courier turned_up today with the new mattress ( es ) and i managed to get them upstairs with no issues - i '_m still_waiting for the courier to return to collect the behemoth sat in my lounge then this stressful ( nothing to do with mattressman ) event will be over .
0	i want to thank the staff at mattressman who went above and beyond to sort_out my problem , and also to the british bed company for effectively creating us a custom mattress .
0	edit_: i '_ll write a product review as soon as i get my head down .
0	we bought a leather - style dog bed off amazon in 0000 and only when i needed to replace it did i research the manufacturer .
0	it turns_out that zippyuk are a british manufacturer of products for your pooch and sell direct to the public as well as via other channels such as amazon .
0	one of our dogs recently developed a nervous incontinence condition so ended_up spoiling the bed we ' d originally bought so having found the name of the manufacturer i put in an order for a new bed .
0	i emailed the company for an order update and was told they were in the process of making my order and that it would be despatched soon .
0	to my delight , the order turned_up the very next_day .
0	the contact i '_ve had with zippyuk has_been courteous and helpful and the two products i '_ve had from them have been of the highest_quality - all the better knowing they are a british company too .
0	this bed will probably see our dogs out but if not , i wouldn_'_t hesitate in using zippyuk again .
0	not much to be said here , ordered some new trainers online and they arrived very within a couple of days .
0	the best companies are the ones who just get your stuff to your door with no_fuss - nike are one such company .
0	many_thanks .
0	i '_m really surprised to read such negative_press about a company and it compelled me to post something positive as that '_s our experiece of mothercare .
0	we ordered a load of stuff back in may and opted for " collect at store " delivery .
0	the order was despatched and arrived at the store in about 0 days , collection was easy and that should have been the end of our dealings with mothercare .
0	fast forward two months , mum - to - be unpacks the crib we '_ve bought only to find the leg was snapped .
0	at this point , you start to doubt if the company you bought from would be that bothered seeing as we '_ve had the product for two months ( albeit being in storage ).
0	a quick call to mothercare customer_services ( not sure what all the noise is about finding their telephone_number , it '_s hardly hidden !)
0	and within 0 minutes we ' d been offered a replacement ( a more_expensive one at that as the same model was out of stock ) and had a courier booked to collect the damaged item .
0	the courier turned_up next_day to collect the broken item and a day later the replacement crib arrived .
0	although many may view this as the least they could have done , it was the speed , efficiency and courtesy with which they dealt_with me that left me feeling they had gone above and beyond .
0	it '_s a shame to admit that had i read the reviews before ordering , i might have thought twice , but my experience of mothercare has_been a positive one and i wouldn_'_t hesitate to use them again .
0	edit_: got home tonight to find my wife had built the crib ... only to find the mattress didn_'_t fit ( despite asking and being told it would ).
0	shame but another quick call and the right mattress will be with us on monday .
0	very helpful once more .
0	i looked at many sites when it came to choosing my blinds but based_upon on fast they delivered my samples ( within 00_hours of ordering them ) i decided to place my order with made to measure_blinds .
0	the site makes it very easy to get the measurements for your blinds correct , and guides you through each_step with ease .
0	there were a vast_array of colours available which i believe can all be ordered as samples for free ( a limit to the number of samples ordered applies which is fair_enough ).
0	we paid about £_00 delivered which was around £_00 cheaper_than most of the other_sites we looked at .
0	the blinds were delivered by city_link within about 0 days of ordering ( i say " about " as they were left with my neighbor who didn_'_t come round with them straight_away ).
0	the blinds were well_packaged in a reinforced cardboard_container , and packaging material was used where required to protect the blinds during_transit .
0	fitting was extremely easy and everything required was placed in a little plastic_bag .
0	a very pleasurable_experience and one which much larger retailers could do with taking note of .
0	thanks for the great service !
0	i have been with netcetera for around 0 years_now i find there services second to none , their professionalism is unquestionable
0	their staff are friendly helpful and polite , i have had no_problems with there service or their staff in the entire time i have been with them , no_complains at all , in my opinion i rank them no 0 for their services and staff i would say experts in their field , i would hightly reccomend them to anyone with first_class service and staff available 00 / 0 you cant go_wrong
0	i order my flowers for both my gf and mum weeks_ago .
0	nothing has arrived , no email apart_from order confirmation .
0	have been trying , unsuccessfully to get in touch with them since this morning via live_chat , they have no phone number ... completely in the dark !
0	!
0	i just want to know the tracking_numbers to reassure_myself that the flowers will be delivered !
0	never ever again !
0	p . s .
0	it seems their livehelp site has just crashed ...
0	lowest_prices i '_ve ever_seen .
0	even with their shipping and tax you ' re still getting the lowest deal around .
0	plus they have lots of cool free stuff to go along with your order .
0	can '_t get any better_than that .
0	just a happy customer !
0	after missing the 00_%_off sale for titanfall on origin , i began to look around the interweb for origin_keys to purchase this at a discount and soon finding this nifty little website .
0	i purchased the game happily and now_proudly own a copy of titanfall for a slice of what the price now is on origin .
0	thanks for providing this great service !
0	!
0	not had an issues in any of the orders i '_ve placed and always prompt despatch .
0	no_hesitation in recommending .
0	i can '_t explain how refreshing it is to be able to ask for advice and get solid no_nonsense answers .
0	i spend a fair_amount on supplements every_month but i don_'_t want to be fleeced .
0	i feel so comfy using echo that it gets my highest_praise and a full quota of stars !
0	i also spoke to andrea on the chat service whilst going through the process as i was using them for the first time , she was very helpful and guided_me through the whole_process .
0	the total_cost was an astonishing £ 0 . 00 cheaper then what royal_mail wanted to charge for a package worth only £_00 . 00 !!!
0	!
0	will_defo let friends and family no about this site cheers :)
0	i was redirected to the hipay site to make the payment for £_00 worth of goods .
0	i have a paypal card ( mastercard ), which i used for completing the order .
0	upon submission it showed me a message_stating that the transaction had been declined .
0	i was then redirected back to the merchant '_s website .
0	i thought i may have entered the wrong details so i tried it again but to no_avail .
0	the same thing happened , i . e .
0	declined transaction -> redirected back to merchant '_s site .
0	i therefore gave up and used my hsbc visa_debit_card instead .
0	this went through without a hitch .
0	i then checked my email to confirm that the order had gone_through correctly .
0	waiting for me in my inbox were 0 emails from paypal confirming that i had sent 0 payments of £_00 each .
0	therefore i '_ve now made 0 payments of £_00 ( 0 from paypal , 0 from hsbc ).
0	i find it completely_unacceptable that a payment solution such as hipay can '_t even implement a system which correctly identifies when a payment has_gone_through .
0	i will now have to waste time reversing the 0 additional payments .
0	i will not be using hipay again .
0	we '_ve been with pipeten for a while now and they have never_let us down .
0	server uptime is great but where i personally feel they shine is their outstanding support .
0	each and every time we '_ve had a query they '_ve responded very quickly with helpful answers .
0	would definitely recommend pipeten to anyone looking for hosting !
0	i needed to order some costumes for my friends stag_do .
0	i left it a little late so was worried there maybe a risk of not receiving the package on time .
0	luckily i found escapade .
0	their prices were competitive and they shipped the item very fast !
0	thank_you escapade !
0	riga was a great place for a stag .

0	i ordered a wing_collar_shirt with next_day delivery - duly_arrived the next_day in good time for the bash .
0	very nice comfortable shirt it is too .
0	from placing the order to receiving the goods , it was really slick and very easy .
0	customer service : rang up 0 times on separate_occasions and each time had a different employee on the other and but always they were very rude , blunt and uninformative of any information i was asking
0	pricing , the prices i found were ridiculous , i went to other_sources and found higher specification parts with a cheaper price tag
0	smoothness , i thought to my self , i may as well give the order a go so i ordered some components for a friend , they took 0_weeks to get here , it said 00 in stock , get an email 0 days_later saying it is not in stock and they said they would issue a refund , i accepted the refund but it never showed up , lone behold 0_weeks , 0 days_later the components arrived , but not only very late , they were faulty !
0	very upset with service and would not go near this website
0	where to begin , order went through very smoothly , got an email the next_day around 0am ( basically starting time ) saying my order is on its way to the courier , so postage was insanely fast considering i didn_'_t pay a penny .
0	customer communication is fabulous , they work very well within the customer service department and have such a friendly service .
0	great unbeatable prices , everything i wanted i could get on here but around 00 - 00 gbp cheaper .
0	so to sum it all up , the company is amazing and do not listen to other reviews !
0	no issues .
0	good , easy online system .
0	helpful email_updates about dispatch and delivery .
0	according to recipient the flowers were well_packaged and " really beautifull ".
0	would recommend to all .

0	hotel was even better_than expectations for the price with a lovely breakfast , quadding was amazing , night life had good choice of venues , never laughed so much in my life !
0	this was for my mates_stag , i would definately consider chillisauce in the future !

0	we arrived in las palmas airport about 00_minutes earlier_than_expected , so i rang the central number and they rang the driver to arrive earlier for us .
0	we had the same driver both_ways , he was very friendly and helpful and the car was immaculate .
0	this took a lot of hassle out of our journeys and was good that we had paid in advance .
0	i would recommend the service to anyone , it was quick and easy and i liked the updates to my phone and email of the flowers progress .
0	i couldn_'_t believe_how easy this service was to use , fully working iphone_0s couldn_'_t ask for anything better , put new sim in and automatically unlocked , thanks guys !
0	supplement_warehouse is the one stop_shop i love it .

0	office_furniture online do not like sending you the goods you have bought and paid for so_far sent to two wrong addresses , still not received and wont refund .. disgusting company with the most apalling customer service when something_goes_wrong .

0	with price matching and fast shipping this supplier can '_t be beat !
0	you can match the price so you don_'_t have to order from 0 different places to get the deals you are looking for .
0	the shipping price isn_'_t bad once you add up all of the shipping prices you would have spent ordering from multiple suppliers .
0	easy ordering_process , no apparent hitches with the payment process and fast delivery of the correct items .

0	excellent service .
0	i have used the book_depository for several_years_now and have been constantly and happily impressed by their response time , book range and service .
0	the range is truly_outstanding , covering almost every book i have ever considered buying ( the only exception i have found is a rather old , quite obscure academic book that is out of print ).
0	the service is swift and precise and i have always received my books in a timely_fashion .
0	especially good given the free delivery .
0	excellent service , good site .
0	no cons from my perspective .
0	i must mimic the notes of all the previous reviewers on here - the money was taken from my account and two_weeks_later no item has_been delivered .
0	i must_say i wish i had checked for reviews such as these before confirming the order .
0	complete cowboys who have simply taken the money with no apparent intention to deliver .
0	order from a reputable retailer .
0	i haven_'_t ordered anything from gear0music before and was a little_bit_dubious_about ordering due to normally only ordering from sites which friends recommend .

0	i ordered a korg pitchblack tuner for a fairly reasonable price .
0	the minimum delivery charge was £ 0 . 00 which isn_'_t so cheap but it arrived two_days_later ( one day after dispatch ) so it was money well spent i guess .
0	i was very happy with the service , i would_gladly_recommend them .
0	i need to remember to write_reviews for good companies as well as bad , and this is one company i would definitely use again .
0	postage was uncannily fast , and the prices are always competitive .
0	great store for your music purchases .
0	can only recommend with 0_stars .
0	i am sure if you have no_problems with this company , a good cheap holiday can be found .
0	but if you ever have to deal with their customer service , you will regret it beyond_belief .
0	due to the country our holiday was being booked in being declared unsafe we called expedia to find out what would happen to our holiday .
0	we were told we could cancel it outright but only in 0_weeks .
0	- 0_weeks_later we called , and they said we had to call back again in 0_weeks .
0	- 0_weeks_later we called back again , and we said we need a refund urgently as we can not go to our holiday destination as it is not allowed by government , can not get insurance and there are no planes flying there .
0	we were than lied to .
0	expedia told us that the planes were flying there from our airport , and that we can get insurance through allianz ( which is funnily_enough our insurance company , so i knew it was a lie ).
0	they asked my wife to pay €_000 there and then for complete insurance inc cancellation .
0	i had my doubts so advised her to wait_until we spoke with our insurance man .
0	he confirmed our fears that we wouldn_'_t be insured for medical in the country we would be going to .
0	we contacted the plane company to find that they were not flying to the country of our destination .
0	the only way their was by indirect flights through other_countries ( which we had paid for a direct flights )
0	we called back again to point this out and ask for a full_refund .
0	we were told that we would be getting a full_refund on the phone .
0	an email 00_minutes later was sent to us , confirming that we would have a full_refund , but would have to call them to confirm this .
0	we called the same day , and it was agreed that we would be getting a full_refund , and that all the details would be in the post .
0	0_weeks_later we still had received nothing , so we called expedia .
0	they advised us that our holiday was not cancelled and was still valid and that a system error must have occurred .
0	we were assured that it would be cancelled and a full_refund given .
0	we asked to be given an email to confirm that within 00_hours .
0	they agreed to do that .
0	0 week_later , no email or contact .
0	we contact expedia again ( after waiting 00_minutes on the phone !!!)
0	to be told that flights should be re - opened for august and so that there is no refund available .
0	the plane company is still showing no flights to the destination , and i have confirmed with the airport that there is none .
0	this company is the biggest bunch of liars and you are ever likely to find , and if i had the time or energy i would take them to court for their contempt for law and in trading practices .
0	you have been_warned by many other people on trustpilot ( check out expedia . com or expedia . co . uk reviews as well ).
0	this company is a scam company that hopefully will not be around for much longer .
0	this company accepts credit_card ( and charges a small surcharge for the pleasure ) but breaks every credit_cards rule in dealing_with them .
0	i paid for the product , and it was shipped very quickly ( at first this was going to be a 0 * review , despite the item being faulty ).
0	the item sent was faulty , but also the quality of the product was below expectation so i decided to get a refund rather_than a replacement .
0	the company agreed with the fault of the product ( it had a manufacturing_defect ) but would not refund my credit_card i had paid to use .
0	instead they would only refund to my english account ( despite then picking_up transnational charges , exchange charges meaning i got less money ).
0	such a method is against mastercard ( how i paid ) rules , as well as all other major credit_card companies .
0	i was advised strongly by my bank not to hand my details over to this company , and they insisted this company was acting either negligently or fraudulently .
0	i emailed get . digitial multiple_times with my bank '_s response , and each time they said ' reversing credit_card transactions is impossible ' which is 000_% a lie as made clear by my bank .
0	in the end my credit_card company reversed the credit_card transaction which was a hassle that wasn_'_t needed .
0	not worth your time , buy from amazon or another similar company with infinitely_better customer service .
0	said the item would take 0 - 0_weeks on website and phone , arrived in just 0 .
0	best price for said item ... what more can i say !
0	after messing_around with a lot of other charlatans in germany , this company proved to be refreshing .
0	danke shoen
0	fast postage , great service , bought a few items already from the . de site , and as usual , everything is perfect .
0	an asset to the online community .
0	prices aren_'_t the cheapest ( although much_cheaper then high - street prices ) but the service and aftersales is worth it in my opinion !
0	bought a kenwood fp000 blender , 0 - 0 days delivery .
0	00_hours after purchasing the item i looked online ( as i had not received a delivery message ) and the item was showing as 00 weeks till delivery for new purchases .
0	i tried_calling this site ( but the phone line directs you to email contact only !!!)
0	i emailed besserepreise saying will it be 00 weeks ?
0	if so please cancel my order and refund immediately .
0	the email was answered over 00_hours_later , stating that the item would not be available to me on time and that i would be refunded immediately .
0	payment was made via_paypal as company had no credit_card or debit_card system ( bank_transfers only or paypal ) paypal refunds are instant , and no refund was made today .
0	this company '_s invoice did not show :
0	delivery time originally stated
0	delivery time expected etc
0	also the company made no attempt to contact me with a problem with this delivery .
0	will never use again , and will advise strongly against to anyone looking to buy from this place .
0	i '_m_sure the money will be refunded , if not i will add to this review and inform paypal of a fraudulent sale .
0	took my new watch to them to have a couple of links taken out .
0	came back later and took the watch .
0	on my way home i noticed they had scratched it in a couple of places ( nothing to bad , but it was an expensive and new watch !)
0	when i put it on at home i realised they had only taken the links of one side of the watch so it was unbalanced .
0	i called up , and the guy said on the phone that he had taken them off equally on each side ...... even_though i was holding the watch right there in my hand !
0	i said to him i have the proof right here that you didnt , but he wouldnt accept it .
0	after a little argument he said he would look at it again .
0	i shouldnt have given it back to them , after the scratces etc , but it was more out of principle to be honest as id paid £ 0 to have a quick and easy service to be done , and they had completly ballsed it up !
0	in the end the watch was sorted but at the cost of another small scuff on the face of the watch !!!
0	!
0	would never use again , and if i had the time and energy would have taken them to small_claims court for damage of property while under their care !
0	you have been_warned , dont give them your watch !
0	maybe their shoe repairs and key_cutting service is better ..... i dont_know .
0	lufthansa always offer a slection of papers for free ( every flight ) unlike_other_airlines , and ive always found the staff curtious and the flights trouble_free .
0	the prices are very reasonable .
0	quick dispatch , no_probs !
0	this is the company that actually may havemade me midly xenophobic against indian_call workers !
0	after calling up about a problem with one of my bills , i ended_up talking to an indian who was telling_me lies and not listening to my problem .
0	even after telling him 00 times , he kept on reading from a script or repeating the same thing .
0	in the end i was passed to another person .
0	this person was either taking the mic with me , or had the strongest accent ive eveer heard .
0	i didnt understand a word he was saying ( sounded_like facejacker ).
0	i lived in thailand for 0 years , im used to strong accents , which makes me think he was just fooling me .
0	after 0 minutes of saying " pardon ?
0	i dont understand you " i hung_up , and recalled to speak to someone_else .
0	the person_who answerd was again indian , in an indian_call_centre .
0	he was clearly watching_tv , and every 0 seconds there was either canned laughter blurting down the phone ( or maybe genuine laughter from the office workers watching a tbv program ??.)
0	the guy was not interested or following anything i was saying , so i assume he was watching_tv ( it was very very loud , so must have been on his desk or bery close ).
0	i hung_up after 00_minutes ( after waiting 00_mins to be put through in the first place .
0	i then called customer complaints to complain_about the lack of english , understanding , the tv , etc_etc .
0	guess where the complaints line goes too ?
0	india ......
0	the person i spoke to sounded exactly like one of the people i was speaking to earlier .
0	after 0 minutes of strong accent i gave up .
0	i have asian friends , from all over the continent , so im not complaining becuase of racial issus , i couldnt care who anwers my call as long as its done professionally .
0	but to have people who cant be understood , people watching_tv instead of listening to you , monkeys with scripts rather then intelligent autonomous people is just a joke .
0	but the icing really is your complaints ... complaints should be english people ... complaints should not be some poor muppet in india with a script that can barely speak the language , it should be a well_versed uk person_who_understands the situation and can deal with each case on an indivual basis .
0	bt is the worst support ever , period , and i was almost in a rage by the time i had finished with this waste of around 0 hours of phone_calls .
0	if what i experianced is normal for the company there really should be an inquest !
0	not being_able to speak to someone_who i can understand , who speaks my own language to deal with my problems for a telecoms monopoly would be illegal no doubt .
0	can '_t wait_until this company changes or bites the dust as it slowly looses its monopoly grip on our telecoms .
0	shame on you bt !!!!
0	!
0	got my summer wheels sorted_out , great service ;-)
0	stuff arrived bang on time , great item , great communication by the people working there , very satisfied in deed
0	firstly , i am lactose intollerent so brought their muscle_milk which was advertisedsquire clearly as lactose_free , affter waiting in all day it arrived and there was no mention on the packaging of it being lactose_free like there was on the picture so to be sure i called them and they said ' oh that flavour isn_'_t lactose_free but some others are !'
0	when i questioned_why it was advertised so they didn_'_t explain just said sorry and they would send me a new one that was and some " samples " of other lactose_free products and i would recieve them the next_day .
0	i waited in the following_day againtwo days_later the protein arrived .... on its own !!
0	i just ignored it and put it down to a bad company .
0	then whilst away i asked my fiancé to order me some protein , unaware of the company i had problems with she ordered from dolphin_fitness .
0	paid extra for next_day delivery and waitied in for it to be delivered .
0	she then called them to see if there was a rough time it would be in as it was the afternoon and nothing had come , the woman on the phone said ' oh_yeah there '_s non of that flavour left , would u like something else and we can get it to you tomorrow ?'
0	they couldn_'_t give a crap about you , they just care about the money they are making , if you question anything they don_'_t have the answers and if you complain they couldn_'_t give a hoot !
0	i would never use this company again !
0	thank_you very much for the fast factory_unlock ( o0 uk premium ) keep_up the good work !
0	i ordered two items for christmas on the 00th of december and they arrived within plenty of time .
0	really couldn_'_t ask for more .
0	:-)
0	i like shopping
0	this is now more than 0 years i '_m using amazon , and i must_admit i never had anything to complain_about : to me , they are the more trustfull online company i know .
0	if you havent tried it yet : do not_hesitate !
0	i ordered a tent from them with two other small items , and received shortly_after a confirmation saying that : " in the unlikely_event that any item you have ordered is temporarily_out of stock we will ship the available items to you and the outstanding items asap ."
0	after 0_weeks i hadn_'_t received the tent yet .
0	i had to call them and someone told me that " the tent was out of stock and they forget to tell me about it ".
0	they added i could chose an other tent from their site as a replacement .
0	the thing is : the tent i was in the first place interested , in was apparently available on their site again , but at a different price : higher_than the one i agreed for on my order .
0	i explained the situation through the phone to someone_who after not beeing very comprehensive , told me she will call me later in the day to tell me what to do : i never get this call back !
0	i had to call them again 0 days_later , and they couldn_'_t yet give me an answer by phone !
0	finally , i got a mail saying i will not get my tent for the price i was suppose to pay , and if i really want it , ( because they had it !)
0	i will have to pay something like 00 £ more !
0	so in the end : i '_ve wasted much time with this people who are unable to comminicate quickly and whose way to sell thing is just disrespectful of any commitment .
0	be really carefull with this company !
0	i was a little_sceptical_about buying contact online but i needn_'_t have been , i simply chose the lenses i wanted , for my prescription and it was as simple as that .
0	their prices were cheaper_than my local_optician and they came 0 days after i ordered , will be using again !
0	great website , awesome product , very fast delivery , and a lollipop thrown in too !
0	i would recommend to all my friends
0	fantastic website !

0	ziip gaming store has_been one of the my biggest guilty secrets in gaming ever_since they started .
0	whenever i have wanted a game but not liked it '_s price tag by the original retailer .
0	i just pop down to ziip . co . uk and check if it '_s in stock and if it '_s cheaper .
0	i always find out that it is cheaper and making the purchase is as easy as just buying the game on steam .
0	thank_you ziip games store for being in us gamers ' lives .
0	all the prices are already low , but if you do find it cheaper they match the price and take 0 %_off no questions_asked .
0	what an amazing company !
0	i ordered flowers to be delivered on valentines_day for my partner .
0	when i initially purchased them i recieved confirmation stating the flowers would be with her on the 00th feburary .
0	this was not the case at all !!!
0	the flowers came today ( 00th ) at around 0 . 00pm , when she had already left !
0	after waiting till_0pm on valentines evening i then had to go to a local_supermarket and purchase a bunch of flowers which i should not have had to do at all .
0	plus , considering the time i had to go , as you can_imagine these were the left_overs that nobody_else wanted .
0	the payment of £_00 . 00 was already taken from iflorist and the time and date that their payment was agreed for was not met .
0	this is an_absolute let_down for both my partner and myself .
0	especially with her travelling back to university today .
0	she did not and will not even get to see the flowers .
0	i have sent an email to support stating my issue and have still had no response as of yet .
0	i have also logged an online ticket and i am still_waiting to hear back .
0	i expect a full_refund .
0	my key was with me instantly and worked hassle_free , this is one of just many_times i '_ve_used the site now and it never lets me down , i '_ll be back once again for anymore keys i need in the future =]
0	i love this place .
0	they always have the latest products at the cheapest prices .
0	most of the time even before they price match .
0	true shipping can get pricy , but i will pay for good service and great products .
0	booked a room through olotels for a stay in london ( reservation number 0000000 ).
0	the booking was non_refundable .
0	at the time of travel , i feel ill . understanding the hotel was non_refundable - i contacted the hotel directly to ask if they would be willing to allow the agency ( olotels ) to move the reservation without_penalty .
0	the hotel were fair , and agreed they would allow olotels to move the reservation to a future date free of charge .
0	i was delighted .
0	i sent olotels an email on 00th_november , immediately after_speaking with the hotel , to advise .
0	the hotel wanted olotels to formally request the change in an email , and they would agree to it .
0	i sent 0 emails chasing this up , each time i got an email_saying ' we will update you shortly '.
0	one time i even called and the agent said she would call back in 00_minutes - and didnt !
0	finally , 00 days_later , olotels send me an email_saying ' i checked into the hotel , and as a result , i will be charged in full '.
0	what a fiasco !
0	when will it end ?
0	i done all the hard work , the hotel were happy to move the booking no problem .
0	now olotels have left it 00 days when this could have been sorted in 0 phone_call .
0	so angry .
0	i would avoid them .
0	****_update 00th_december_0000 ****
0	the supplier offered a 0 night refund which was ok .
0	if they acted_upon what the hotel offered ( to move the full reservation ) i would not have lost out on one night .
0	i feel olotels were too slow to act and this is why i lost out .
0	i feel as though the frontline customer_care let olotels down .
0	shame you have to shout about your bad_experience on here before they take things seriously .
0	ana from the customer_satisfaction team was very helpful .
0	booked twice with alpha_rooms , both_times the hotel has_become unavailable after a day or so .
0	the most_recent booking the hotel showed ' immediate availability ' and turns_out this is not the case .
0	they operate a premium_rate customer_care line and do not have adequate resource to handle the calls .
0	this is an inappropriate way to generate revenue .
0	there is always a wait when you call .
0	their agent '[ private_data_removed ]' was monotone and dry .
0	he showed no basic customer_care skills
0	alpharooms website showed immediate availability .
0	when the booking confirmed it simply said ' your booking is not confirmed until your bank approve payment '.
0	no warning to say the reservation was on a request only basis .
0	this is the second time alpharooms has done this to me
0	alpharooms agent [_private_data_removed_], and business process , expect a customer to send various emails to get a fair price for alternative_accommodation .
0	alpharooms do not empower an agent to resolve this there and then ( the alternative_accommodation offered was offered at the same price - even_though it was a cheaper property !)
0	[_private_data_removed_] tried to pass me to a manager and couldn_'_t , he asked me to ' keep calling to try to catch one '.
0	this is such a shady business practice expecting me to call a premium number repeatedly when trying to give them over £_000 + revenue
0	[_private_data_removed_] promised to refund the payment and didn_'_t
0	i had to call again to chase a refund that was never processed
0	i have to send this email to request a refund .
0	if this was the case , why was i not told in the first place .
0	i used to love alpharooms - always managed to get amazing prices .
0	after this i strongly doubt i will use them again .
0	shame - because they seem to have good reviews on here .
0	update - just called them today to see where my refund was ( after sending the lengthy email to them as instructed ) and guess_what - it wasn_'_t processed .
0	shocking service from a shocking company ***
0	reference efxrrkr
0	*** sorry but not , everything is not sorted now .
0	your complaints team have not even acknowledged my email let_alone replied .

0	much_better_than insuring with the network direct ( similar policy for around half the price ).
0	easy to buy .
0	perfect !
0	very good choice of products at very competitive_prices .
0	delivery was fast and free !
0	also got a free_sample of usn whey which i wasnt_expecting so that was nice_surprise !
0	highly_recommend .
0	i am so glad i chose to order some supplements from echo !
0	for a start the deal they were offering on the product i wanted was excellent , i couldn_'_t find a better price online .
0	there was a slight_problem with the delivery but this was my fault for putting in a bad address when ordering .
0	a guy from echo phoned me up to explain the problem and was very helpful and made sure everything was sorted .
0	my order then arrived the next_day !
0	also received a sample packet of biox whey for free which i wasn_'_t expecting !
0	cant recommend them enough !
0	i phoned up to get advice for a new treadmill i wanted to buy for my home .
0	the staff were really helpful and gave_me great advice .
0	the payment process was quick and easy and i '_ve started burning calories on my brand_new treadmill .
0	thanks new level !

0	thanks asda .
0	thanks jones & son for your great bird_spikes product .
0	birds were nesting on my roof for months and the steel spikes have stopped them nesting or trying to return to my roof .
0	the strips are great value for money - would highly_recommend to friends or businesses that need the bird_spikes solution !
0	many_thanks !
0	very professional , so happy to have switched supplement providers .
0	prompt and reliable with competitive price .
0	i would love to give this company 0_stars .
0	however their choice of delivery partner is dismal .
0	0 orders and 0 problems with yodel and myprotein customers services seem be happy to brush this off as not there problem once order has left them .
0	it seems customer service and valuing business needs to be improved
0	great selection of parts and i found exactly_what i was after within_seconds at a great price !
0	great service until you don_'_t meet the minimum_spend criteria as an account_holder .
0	we were penalised around £_000 in one invoice .
0	great service for receiving and sending_parcels but avoid_avoid_avoid setting_up a business account unless you are absolutely certain you will meet the minimum_spend criteria !
0	if you ' re looking to get your glasses in a timely_manner , and actually have contact with the customer service department when you call , the speckyfoureyes is definitely not worth looking at .
0	i placed my order over 0 and a half weeks_ago , and still i am waiting .
0	also , i have contacted the number of their website , which seems to be directed to a satellite office where you ' re told that someone will call you back , which is a joke .
0	i contacted them around 0 times , and they only managed to contact me once , via_text_message , talk about a personal_touch !
0	!
0	next time i order glasses , i '_ll be sure never to consider them again .
0	great service .
0	have used regularly for 0 years .
0	very convenient , friendly and well priced .
0	definitely recommend .
0	we were fed_up with using some of the aggregators out there and so we entered into a working relationship with txtnation .
0	it was the best decision i made to use txtnation .
0	they are very helpful when dealing_with issues or setting_up new connections .
0	they will_continue to get my business going forward and i will not have any problem referring them to anyone .
0	after a long time of using my iphone as an ipod now it is ringing again really thank_you and i recommend it for all .
0	have used these_guys many_times , and have had absolutely nothing but praise for them .
0	i have recently ordered t - shirts in the wrong_size , and also got a mug with a hairline_crack along the bottom , causing it to leak droplets of water , but within_00mins of emailing , i received a response .
0	they even sent out a replacement mug and told me to the keep the old one , and also the same for one of the t - shirts i had bought - that '_s £_00 they saved me , and for absolutely no need , i would have happily returned it .
0	amazing , will recommend !
0	great prices , with the debit_card reduction it '_s a good overall price .
0	delivery was only 0 or 0 working_days , best i could ask for seeing as i went for free delivery !
0	i '_m_sure the ' very good ' reviews on here are fake , half of them cant type in english but they claim they are from newcastle etc !

0	last_year ( june_0000 ) i bought a diamond platinum engagement_ring for my fiancée .
0	diamond_geezer made sure everything was perfect from_start to finish .
0	i hate buying anything online - tian smith ensured that he accommodated for me every way possible .
0	i must '_ve phoned him at_least 00 times before buying the ring - and by the time i placed the order - i was very short of time !
0	they made sure the ring was with me before my special_occasion .
0	i promised diamond_geezer that i will be back to buy our_wedding_rings .
0	last month i bought 0 wedding_rings - clive & luke were sooo helpful is was unbelieveable - there was never any pressure to buy anything .
0	my finacee '_s engagement_ring was a difficult one to match with the wedding_ring - within no time diamond_geezer provided me with a cad image of how they could make the rings fit together !
0	delivery was also very fast !!
0	defo would recommend to anyone anytime !

0	i placed an order with sunglasses_shop for some fairly expensive custom oakley_sunglasses , something which this website informed me would take on average 0 days before being dispatched and would have a trackable delivery .
0	weeks_later i had received nothing and heard_nothing .
0	i asked and was grudgingly told that it was taking longer_than normal .
0	as such i did not have the glasses for the trip_abroad i had bought them for .
0	on my return , they still had not been delivered and i was due to move away from my property for an extended_period .
0	i asked the shop to give me an eta .
0	they said check the ups site but gave_me no tracking_number , so i had to ask for this separately .
0	i realised that the order ( now unapologetically about a month late ) was not going to be delivered in time before i left so i requested a change of delivery address .
0	sunglasses_shop processed this so slowly that it was too late .
0	i had moved away for two months .
0	when i returned i found no sunglasses waiting for me .
0	examination showed that they had been delivered , and allegdly signed for , by some complete_stranger , not even someone_who_lives in my building .
0	obviously this defeats the point of a signed for delivery .
0	however , by the time i had confirmed that this was the case the window for complaints had closed .
0	i was shunted between equally incompetent members of customer service , each one apparently too_lazy to read the previous emails in the thread .
0	the upshot of this is that apparently it is considered ok by this shop to fail to deliver their products to the customer , regardless of circumstances ; that keeping the customer informed of what is happening to their order is distinctly optional ; and that requests by the customer will be dealt_with lazily .
0	i am now £_000 the poorer for having dealt_with this store and they are apparently guilt - free for never having fulfilled the most basic requirement of selling something .
0	placed an order , made a slight_error on my account creation , on my email address , which was my fault , submitted a ticket on which i was advised what the problem was and then it was all sorted .
0	i would suggest that you add an additional box for confirming your email address on account creation , this would help stop people from making typos and reduce support traffic for you .
0	delivered promptly and the order was correct .
0	also much_cheaper_than other_sites .
0	yesterday , after browsing the net for a while , i found your cnm catering equipment uk .
0	it was easy to navigate , clear and understandable .
0	everything was organized in a logical fashion .
0	i am absolutely_delighted with the site and also with your excellent service .
0	well_done to all your staff who are involved in that process !
0	have bought multiple items from wineware .
0	they have a great range ( albeit site could be more navigable ).
0	the after sales service is great .
0	delivery is prompt ( and free over £_00 ).
0	packaging is high_quality to prevent breakages .
0	handled one instance where stock was not available in the uk extremely well - highly_recommended .
0	sportspursuits had some great deals on camping_gear ; with a good range of products from top_brands .
0	service and price were great , although the wait for delivery means it doesn_'_t work so well if you need something instantly !
0	overall a great place to upgrade your kit and get a bargain in the process
0	i found ziip in the past , well over a year_ago , and have used them since .

0	thank_you ziip , you have a very happy customer : d
0	i '_ve been a customer with zfast since_0000 , and have always experienced the best support possible , the reps dan & lee will do everything to make_sure your problem is solved .
0	my most_recent problem was effecting my business and this was solved in less_than a few hours .
0	highly_recommended uk web host for your website .
0	yodel delivered my package on time and the delivery driver was very friendly when delivering my package .
0	they should be_congratulated on such a superb service .
0	will be definitely using again !
0	i ordered from wrappz . com a few_times now and every time i have , the service has just been brilliant !
0	the skins i have ordered are of the highest_quality and the website is so easy to use .
0	wrappz is the best company out there to provide your phone case or skin .
0	i ordered what i wanted and it delivered as per the website .
0	they '_ve got a really good selection and prices too .
0	i originally used drive dynamics to find an instructor for another area of edinburgh when i lived there .
0	the first 0 lessons for £_00 ( with 0 lessons added to when you take the test ) seemed like a good offer , and the first instructor was called scott and was great .
0	he was extremely skilled , calm and never cancelled a lesson .
0	he was adaptable and even ended_up giving me the rest of the lessons without leaving any at the end .
0	he was the best instructor i ever had , but also the last good one .
0	when i moved back to london , i was put with an instructor who kept cancelling and reshuffling lessons , although taught well .
0	things were fine until he decided to stop returning my calls or refund my 0 lessons ( not including the introductory lessons ).
0	drive dynamics did nothing to chase him up and took_ages to match me up to another driver .
0	they had passed me back and forth_between customer representatives and all of them made me false yet convincing promises to phone back or deal with the problem , but it only ended_up prolonging my matching me up with another instructor .
0	they had lost contact with this instructor and did not have any way to chase him up for money .
0	they did not even bother to tell me this when he left the agency to warn any customers of their inability to deal with the problem .
0	this instructor '_s name is steve benjamin .
0	then desmond , the next driver , cancelled the 0nd lesson on the day after i had been waiting 00_minutes with no word and after texting and calling him .
0	then he moved the lesson to the weekend and was 0 hours late on the day again when i told_him to call it off .
0	he has still not refunded the other two lessons + three lessons ( for when you take your test ) despite my asking him .
0	i doubt if drive dynamics have chased him up or did anything useful , even_though the customer representative promised to do so .
0	they matched me , took their fee and did their minimum to help me out and passed me from one representative to another .
0	finally , they were trying their best to make me not phone them again because chasing up an instructor doesn_'_t make them money , at_least that '_s what it seems .
0	i have only a few_months until my theory will run out , but now i am so put off from learning to drive , i don_'_t think i '_ll bother until the next time i feel like being messed_around by driving instructors .
0	all i can say is that i ordered two dvds and i got them in their estimated timeframe .
0	no_hassle .
0	also , fairly competitive_prices , especially as i didn_'_t have to pay for postage and packaging .
0	great service and range of products from the guys at function 00 !
0	a one stop_shop for golfing and skiing gear .
0	will_definately be using them again !
0	i '_m a very hard hard guy to please , and i '_m extremely quick to complain - not needed with mpb .
0	okay so the prices on some things may not be as much as you get selling it privately but when you take into account free_postage ( they send a courier next_day ), lack of commission / any other fees and waiting for a buyer to be happy etc ... quite reaosnable .
0	staff are all polite , knowledgeable and very quick to respond to emails .
0	top_notch service .
0	everytime i have booked a room through travelodge they have wanted in excess of £_00 . 00 .
0	lets get this straight first of all - they are a cheap motel , nothing else .
0	they have no public facilities , lounges , bar , restaurant etc , just a reception and very basic rooms .
0	so why am i paying prices that a 0_star hotel charge ?
0	then there are their 0 websites running side by side .
0	use the one that starts www0 as the other is woefully slow and doesn_'_t work correctly with firefox or google_chrome .
0	the customer service over the phone is reasonable although they are limited on the information they can give and also remedial methods should the website break mid transaction and mess up your booking .
0	after much coverage in the media about cheap airlines hidden_charges , ryan_air still insist on adding the charges only after you '_ve decided which destination / time / date to fly .
0	pyut them up at the start them we can compare easily as the flights i went for were cheaper at ba , klm and air france .
0	it is staggering that this company still allows anonymous reviews by anyone and everyone regardless whether they have eaten at x restaurant or stayed at y hotel .
0	the vast_majority of negative the reviews are unqualified and written by people with a grudge and the vast_majority of the superb reviews are written by people who are either related to or actually by the owners of the businesses .
0	even trip advisors own ceo says that the reviews posted should be taken with a lightly at best .
0	then there are trip advisors staff who are under so much pressure to ensure negative_reviews are posted and stay on , in the words of their own marketing manager , nothing sells quite like negative stories - hence their ' horror hotels ' emails to all their users .
0	if you want actual reviews by genuine people who stayed at hotels , then visit laterooms - they can only leave a review there if they have actually stayed at the hotel .
0	i have used envirofone several_times now and have never been disappointed .
0	great service !
0	the windows are excellent , however , the whole_process was arduous and frustrating .
0	on arrival of the installation engineer it became_clear that most of what we had asked for over the phone 0 months previously had not been updated on the records so we had a desperate morning liasing between the engineer and their customer service to make_sure everything was as we wanted .
0	this also included unexpected extra costs as we had received new invoices but they were so unclear that we weren_'_t able to follow the changes in the charges .
0	we ' re happy with the windows but when we replace the future ones i '_m not sure we will use ventrolla as the experience was not a pleasant one .
0	i '_ve been shopping with amazon for many and i '_ve never had any_issues with them .
0	yes they may not be the cheapest but they sure do make up for it with fast delivery times and excellent customer service .
0	i '_ve bought items in the past where the price has dropped a few_days after , only to be sent an email with the price difference back .
0	likewise when an item went missing there was no_hesitation and they sent out a replacement straight_away .
0	i ' d recommend this site to anyone - i was able to find the fossil_watch i wanted with pretty_much the lowest_price online .
0	the watch was delivered within a couple of days well_packaged and with the official fossil presentation tin .
0	brilliant .
0	i '_ll be back .
0	i just purchased a new onkyo - dali system from exceptional_av and i can '_t rate them highly_enough .
0	they really know their stuff and the guy i was on the phone to was able to recommend a slight_adjustment to my order based on newly_released products .
0	i live in northern_ireland , yet the system still arrived the next_day - that '_s pretty_cool .
0	i noticed a minor item had been missed off the order , but a quick email to them and it arrived , yet again , the next_day .
0	they don_'_t sell rubbish - only quality systems and i couldn_'_t beat their prices anywhere .
0	my advice - do your research and then get on the phone to speak to them directly .
0	i found them really friendly and extremely well informed .
0	once i new what i wanted the ordering_process was quick and easy .
0	seriously impressed and i ' d recommend them to anyone looking for a serious audio system .
0	if you ' re looking for a good quality accessory for your mobile_phone ( especially current , top - end models ) then do have a look at mobilefun . com .
0	they '_ve got a great range of products , most of which are good brand_names and good quality products .
0	their website contains lots of details and nice pictures of the products and it '_s easy to browse .
0	on ordering they provided lots of detail about delivery estimates and the product arrived well within the advised dates .
0	this is a very professional , quality service and i have no problem in recommending them to you .
0	the towel_radiator arrived within a couple of days and exactly as_described .
0	it looks_stunning and the values that were recommended on the website are a perfect match and were packed neatly inside the main box .
0	to top it off , it was a decent price even once delivery to northern_ireland was included .
0	i ' d absolutely recommend a look .
0	bought a jacket , ladies trousers and child carrier .
0	prices online were as good as anywhere_else .
0	delivery was efficient , and when the trousers went back because they didn_'_t fit , their returns_policy and refund was very prompt .
0	phoned the order through , rather_than using online to get advice and talk to the salesman .
0	advice was good , and friendly .
0	would use again .
0	i have used my protein . com numerous_times over the past few_months .
0	their product is always top quality and at a price that few other_websites can compete with .
0	all produce is always delivered in a timely_manner with no_fuss or problems .
0	can '_t recommend them highly_enough .
0	stumbled on across simplygames through an app on my iphone and i '_m always quite dubois when ordering online through a provider i '_ve not heard of .
0	so i took the plunge and ordered and to my amazement and happiness the ordered was processed at great speed and delivered at an even faster speed .
0	simplygames is now one of my go - to websites when ordering video_games .
0	i ordered bow_tie , cummerbund and handkerchief : only chose standard delivery but the goods turned_up next_day !
0	great value , well_done .
0	stumbled_across this website by chance tonight , fantastic online help team , willing to tell you anything you need - purchase was hassle_free and very convenient , highly_recommended !
0	purchase - fifa_00 serial_number
0	anyone looking for an_alternative to the rip - off prices that high_street_opticians charge for your contact_lenses , look no further !
0	lenstore . co . uk has everything you need , at amazing prices !
0	!
0	i got my 0 months worth of contacts for under £_00 including delivery and it was here the next working day ,
0	i would definitely recommend this site to all of my friends and family !
0	it really doesn_'_t get any better then this .
0	every product you can think of , easy search options and will beat any internet price you can find .
0	not to mention free stuff !
0	i will being doing all my business from now on right here at supplement_warehouse !
0	this company organised our recent stag_do and did an exemplary job .
0	from the very initial_enquiry they were efficient and keen to help and they dealt_with all our changing requests without_any hassle .
0	thier website and payment system is ideal so one person doesn_'_t have to foot the bill and claim it back off friends .
0	would not hesitiate in telling people to use them as they were brilliant and i will take my business back to them with any future events like this i organse .
0	funny how this review site has over 00 , 000 reviews for a website with 000 twitter followers while a massive company like amazon has a little over 0 , 000 .
0	maybe if they spent less time setting_up fake accounts and giving glowing praise to their rubbish service and more time actuallly sending the orders people have been waiting over a month for .
0	they are thieves , they are liars and they don_'_t deserve your custom .
0	first time user and there were very helpful with my inquires .
0	loving my new trousers too .
0	have had virgin now for 0 month , recieving promised internet speeds + more at all times ( alough they do limit torrent ports through peek times ).
0	phone is spot on and so is tivo_box .
0	was a customer of orange broadband and was recieving speeds of between 0 . 0meg and 0meg when all my neighbours were getting 0 - 0meg .
0	when ever i called it was an offshore call_center and they make you go through a massive list of things to check which are the same no matter what you problem is ( strange ).
0	in the end i have changed to virgin who up to now ( 0 month ) have been awesome !
0	!
0	they make there prices look like a good deal with free p_&_p then drop you into a amazon checkout with one of there new ( and probably soon to be deleted ) accounts where you have to look really close to see that there charging £ 0 standard ( 0 - 0 working_days ) delivery for a sd_card !!
0	!
0	adjusrt the quantitys and the delivery charge almost doubles ( funny that ).
0	stay_away from them in my opinian .
0	i did some_research for some light_weight sun_glasses as my last pair finally gave up on me so i though i would splash_out .
0	i went for a pair of the carbon_fibre frame less ray_bans .
0	fashion_eyewear had the cheapest i could_find at the time + i got myself some cashback via topcashback . co . uk .
0	delivery time was a little_longer_than_expected but i wasn_'_t in a hurry ( we have snow and no signs of sun ).
0	ordered a sofa set online monday and was contacted by phone on tuesday with delivery date .
0	i had a call from the driver about 0 hour before he was due to arrive which gave_me plenty of time to get back home to accept the delivery .
0	the quality was exceptional was very dubious_about buying a large furniture item online but featuredeco was brilliant .
0	i also found out that they had a showroom so i have had a look at some of the beautiful sets they have to offer .
0	i have already_recommended to my friends and family .
0	thanks to a brilliant team effort .
0	easy booking process and well managed service - will use again
0	all i wanted to do was cancel my mobile_broadband .
0	i don_'_t use it .
0	it was a great price , but if i don_'_t use it , its still expensive !
0	!
0	the cs person talked over me consistently , claiming she had regulatory information to tell me which was nonsense - she was just saying i '_ll not get the discount back if i come_back and ask for it .
0	i don_'_t want the discount - i just want to cancel the bloody thing !
0	!
0	given how hard it was to actually do that , i would seriously doubt i '_ll ever go back , but if i do it will be based on a decision in the future , not her trying to convince me not to cancel !
0	so .. waste my time on the phone , get a bad review on trustpilot .
0	seems a fair trade .
0	visited the showroom and looked and touched at the watches before ordering over the internet .
0	stunning watch arrived quickly and well_packaged , all handled with the professionalism that is lacking in most places these days .
0	item was as in the despription and shipment was very fast .
0	a +++
0	i highly_recommend them .
0	quick delivery and excepional service
0	only company i know that offers 00 day no_fuss swap on games .. soo annoying when you shell out 00 quid and the game turns_out to be rubbish
0	best service ever .
0	gave_me a great price for my old phone .
0	posted phone back on friday and money was in my account on monday_morning
0	this was the first time we used printerland . co . uk however won_'_t be the last .
0	we ordered a brother_mfc - 0000dn multi - function printer which is of great quality .
0	the price printerland . co . uk sold the unit for was much_cheaper_than our usual hardware / it reseller could get and free delivery to boot .
0	what more could you ask for ?
0	gav hughes
0	my technician chris was a top lad .
0	service was excellent and turned_up a few minutes early .
0	will_definitely use this company again !
0	not only where theflightcasecompany . com the cheapest company for my ac00 flight case they also delivered on time .
0	the case is self is a exactly_what i need , soft on the inside and hard ( as nails ) on the outside !
0	no more worries_about that my combo is going to look like when i pull it out of the back of the van !
0	i paid a bit extra for next_day delivery so i can '_t say what the normal free delivery would have been like but for me the service was stellar !
0	they texted and emailed me when the item was at each_stage to confirm to me that it would get there and even gave_me a delivery window which was accurate , really impressed !
0	i like the website and way you can search for what you want by specifying manufacturer , price , screen size and especially features !
0	i would certainly buy from these_guys again !
0	in fact i am telling everyone about the good deal i got and sending them here . i bought a dell adamo onyx laptop for £_000 and am just endlessly impressed with it .
0	i just cannot_believe that a machine like this could be so cheap !
0	00 second boot time , full metal 00mm design is the best i have ever_seen .
0	doesn_'_t get too hot from surfing and decent battery_life ... oh and a backlit keyboard ... it '_s insanely good !
0	!
0	in fact the only thing that could be improved about the website is the ability to review individual products like this to help others make purchasing decisions but i wont remove a star for that .
0	after several bad_experiences with other cheshire based bike_shops .
0	i gave global_bike a try and have never looked back .
0	they are efficient , well stocked , knowledgable and very competitive on price ( often cheaper_than wiggle and crc ) and are a top bunch to boot !
0	the team there have a great mix of experience and race competitively in all cycle walks of life i . e .
0	xc mtg , dh , freeride , road , time trial etc .
0	i now buy all my gear from global and have any repairs i cant do / haven_'_t got the time to do carried_out by their excellent mechanics .
0	i would have no_reservations in recommending global_bike to anyone , beginner or pro , in any cycling genre .
0	i like chain_reaction cycles and have used them for years but will not be using them anymore .
0	i ordered several products that say " in stock " on the website on several different occassions only to find after calling coustomer service that they do not have them and / or have discontinued items .
0	crc need to increase proactive communication .
0	sorry crc but i '_ll be going elseware from now on .
0	never had a bad_experience using this service , have placed four tenants so_far .
0	traditional letting_agents ' days are numbered !
0	exactly as requested , delivers fast , lowest_price .
0	can '_t fault .
0	very quick delivery as always pleasure_doing_business
0	thanks for a great service : efficient communication , quick delivery .
0	very happy with my purchase .
0	ordered the audio_technica ws00i headphones .
0	we had to change change pick_up to delivery - no problem , different day for delivery then pick_up - no problem .
0	everything_went smooth and people on the phone were polite and efficient .
0	used for a long time , always bitcoins within an_hour , ( mainly_due to blockchain but that can '_t be helped ) once the transaction didn_'_t go through in 0 hours but they sorted it out for me without_any input and i had my bitcoins a assume as soon as the account_holder woke_up
0	was able to have no os so i could put my own on , very well priced base_unit , all the bits i wanted to put in it , delivery was excellent , all_round great service .
0	cjs is a fantastic company that offers competitive_prices on games and associated products .
0	the prices are unbeatable , and so is the service .
0	fast payment , fast delivery , fast satisfaction .
0	highly_recommended !
0	i ordered a 0ds game ( professor layton and the azran legacy ) to be delivered on release day .
0	not only did i receive my order on the correct day ( unlike past experience with other_websites ) but the order was well_packaged and the price was the cheapest around .
0	will_certainly order again in the future .
0	i am so furious with paypal words cannot describe it !!
0	i run a very reputable_company which requires me having paypal , so every now and then i need to pay for services / goods to my suppliers .
0	anyway cutting the story_short - i opened a business account with paypal , which i then linked my business account to it , only to find out after 0 days that my account has_been refused - with no explanation why !!
0	now , my money that i initially transferred is blocked for 000 days !
0	!
0	absolutely nonsense !
0	!
0	brought a old skool nokia_0000 for my dad as that is the only phone he could use .
0	searched through ebay an amazon trying to locate a good possible deal .
0	saw a few offers on amazon but whilst on there came_across refurb phone .
0	fortunately they had a number i could call them on .
0	they picked_up almost straight_away ( very impressed ) .
0	i asked them all the relevant question .
0	the lady on the phone was very pleasant .
0	taken in by her charm i ordered the phone .
0	some how she managed to persuaded me to take additional items .
0	anyway received the phone the next working day an i must_say i am surprised .
0	the phone was boxed with all accessories an looked absolutely emmaculate .
0	my dad is going to be very pleased indeed .
0	will_defo recommend
0	nothing special and then found thing i brought was cheaper when we arrived !
0	got a three year_old dyson but a couple of small parts broken by wife !
0	managed to replace just the parts for £_00 - thought i was going to have to buy a new one for considerably more - perhaps that is what she wanted .
0	part arrived two_days_later so she could finish hoovering :)
0	despite popular opinion that pimlico_plumbers can be more_expensive than many outfits , i booked an appointment anyway finally having had enough of the useless excuses for ' tradesmen ' that had darkened my door up until now trying to fix an ongoing plumbing problem .
0	steven osbourne arrived bang on time at 0am , despite me only having called their london office 00_hours before .
0	he was professional , friendly and efficient .
0	identified the problem immediately , picked_up the parts and completed the work within 00_minutes .
0	the whole_experience was a complete breath of fresh_air and well_worth the hourly_rate .
0	the piece of mind and sense of relief i felt from finally having the issues fixed by someone whose judgement i immediately trusted was most welcome .
0	well_worth every_penny , and having discovered a company with a service head and shoulders_above the rest , i would not_hesitate to book them again for future jobs .
0	i '_ve_used tyre_shopper a few_times , always one of the cheapest and i can then choose a local_fitter .
0	to give you an idea of price i purchased 0 goodyear efficient grip tyres for my 0000 honda_civic .
0	i checked reviews and the tyres were highly_rated .
0	i got a code for tyre_shopper for 0 %_off and paid £_000 for the 0 inc fitting , disposal of old tyres etc .
0	they were fitted at national_tyres .
0	national '_s price for one of these tyres was £_000 .
0	same product and fitted at the same location .
0	tyre_shopper are superb .
0	i love this site .
0	they basically have every supplement you would want , then some .
0	i hate how the more commercial websites like gnc and bodybuilding always seems to stop carrying my favorite supplement because it was " discontinued " and supplement_warehouse always seems to have it .
0	everything was already well priced and an online discount_code made my new oakleys a fantastic price !
0	they came well_packed and arrived very prompt :)
0	i had a slight_issue with a parcel not being collected on monday , which was the fault of the courier company , not p0g ( remember that these_guys are facilitators and not courier '_s themselves ).
0	however , i used their online_chat tool to speak with george in customer_services and i have to say that i was thoroughly pleased with the service i have received .
0	george was extremely_helpful and rearranged collection immediately , reissued collection notes and uprated the delivery service to ensure my parcel still arrived on time .
0	parcel was collected today .
0	great service and will_definitely be using again - especially with their facebook discount_code !
0	definitely the best way to unlock your iphone , mine is a 0gs at & t and it takes only 0 day .
0	now i '_m really happy with my cellphone and i can use it with any carrier .
0	thanks !
0	!
0	a company that , over time , has_become_complacent in relation to not only the service that they claim to offer but customer service also .
0	forever sending out sim '_s that don_'_t work , taking money from you for payment but not adding it to the account for some time ( can be up to a day at times if not longer )
0	numerous outages , misleading marketing strategies , where do i begin ?
0	i shall be leaving them at the end of this month for sure .
0	parcel0go save a fortune posting anything over 0kg - and they collect from your door
0	have good xmas
0	i ordered branded_usb pens and when they arrived they were much_better quality than_expected .
0	will_definitely choose to use them again in the future .
0	vast_choice of hostels to choose from , well - laid_out website , and no booking_fee !
0	i '_ve_used hostel_bookers before , and i '_m_sure i will again .
0	i was amazed at the speed at which i was able to sell my phone to mazuma .
0	they sent me the bag and documentation within a day .
0	i then sent my phone the following_day .
0	i was kept_updated at every_stage , via e_- mail , about the progression of my order .
0	before i knew it , the money was in my account .
0	would definitely recommend to everyone .
0	great stuff .
0	having used northern_parrots for almost 0 years i have always been very pleased with the quality that the items arrive in and the speed that they arrive ( normally the next_day after i receive my dispatch email ).
0	having had to return an item due to damage in transit i got to see how well the returns team handled my request and i think they did a fantastic job , my replacement arrived within only a few_days of me emailing to say i had to send the other one back .
0	keep_up the good work and i will be using you for many more years =)
0	what happened there ?
0	!
0	i chose lovefilm to watch viking .
0	season 0 was released , but there '_s only 0 episode .
0	it is completely rebranded , i feel like like i '_m on amazon supposed to shop some shit where i only want to be in the good old love_film planet .
0	but it '_s gone now ...
0	i was very happy with the service that i got .
0	000_%
0	the order arrived when they said it would .
0	all good !
0	going to shop there again
0	i read a lot of reviews , mainly negative , of cyberpower before placing an order with them .
0	from_start to finish i have had very much pleasure and confidence in them as delivering what i asked for .
0	i was even a pest after_placing my order and requested a few upgrades , which was not an issue to them .
0	the ship date was stated in the website for the 00th_dec 00 , i didn_'_t receive the rig until 00rd_dec 00 .
0	although i wanted the pc the day after i had ordered it , i knew i would have to wait a little unless i wanted to pay for fast track .
0	because i '_m tight there was no chance in that .
0	one thing i did pay for was saturday delivery , due on 00st_dec 00 .
0	this didn_'_t happen , although it was dpd '_s error not cyberpower '_s .
0	they are a very unprofessional outfit after numerous_calls to them , i even offered to collect from the depot - all of my solutions to my failed delivery was declined .
0	a reason of ' no keys for access ' was given - i say bollocks , it '_s all down to the depot manager not taking responsibility for his personnel '_s mistake and rectifying it to a suitable compromise .
0	would definitely not recommend this courier due to the unprofessionalism of the depot and poor complex handling of the manager .
0	cyberpower has since apologized on their behalf and refunded the extra fee paid for this failed saturday delivery , a refund that was processed very quickly .
0	another good point on cyberpower '_s part !
0	my rig ( no overclocking );
0	corsair 000r case
0	gigabyte sata iii motherboard
0	amd 0000 six core 0 . 0gig
0	amd radeon r0 000 0gb gpu
0	kingston 000gb_ssd
0	kingston 0x_0gb blu hyper ram
0	corsair 000w_psu
0	certain reviews complained of the case being too ' open ' and ' fans sounding like an aircraft taking off '.
0	i prefer my components being cool rather_than an uber expensive fan or cooling_system that i need to worry_about working .
0	i use my pc for gaming and use a headset so i can '_t see the noise problem ever bothering me !
0	overall the machine works_perfectly , my brother in law is very jealous of my machine .
0	it shows very good value for money .
0	i will do_business again with cyberpower and will_definitely recommend to anyone looking to buy !
0	thanks and compliments go out to all involved in my purchase .
0	you have made a nearly bald man a very happy one .
0	hope you all had a good christmas and enjoy your new year !
0	kind_regards

0	i paid for my new pc to be delivered on a saturday , at a cost of £_00 . 00 .
0	i kept logging_onto their website to check on the progress of delivery .
0	from first light on the day of delivery the status was advertised as ' enroute to local_depot ' ' delivery will be before 00pm .
0	i waited in all morning and logged in on a number of occasions to see if there was an update to no_avail .
0	i had the upmost faith and trust in the company to deliver as i had paid a very good price to receive the parcel 0 days early from the normal routine .
0	around 0000am i started to feel a bit_concerned as to the no show .
0	i then logged in only to find that the system had been updated to say that there was a problem with my parcel and they would be unable to deliver it until monday .
0	i did not receive a phone_call nor even an email to appraise me of the ' problem ' my parcel had encountered .
0	i called the customer service centre and spoke with some lovely people , in particular patricia , who showed the upmost sympathy and seemed to attempt to resolve my issue .
0	after she liaised with the local_depot ' manager ', i personally wouldn_'_t describe him as a manager as he did nothing to compromise or negotiate to get my parcel to me .
0	instead informing_me through patricia that he was unable to access the ' trailer ' it had been incorrectly stowed within and secured .
0	he didn_'_t even give me the respect to call me and discuss himself !
0	unacceptable behavior towards a customer in my books .
0	as i was due away for the next few weeks for operational reasons , i offered to attend the depot for pickup , that was refused .
0	i offered to look through the trailer myself for my individual parcel - apparently ' thousands of parcels ' are secured on it , that was refused .
0	i asked how he would get access in case of a fire or other emergency if there were ' no keys for the trailer available ', no excuse received !
0	i understand mistakes_happen , but it '_s how you rectify them to make it up to the customer that counts - on this one dpd has failed massively .
0	after_reading other people '_s reviews here i now understand that delivery problems with this company is a normal thing joint on to this is bad excuses !
0	i will not be using this company again , if i need to pay more to buy items from other_companies then so be it .
0	it '_s not worth the hassle trusting these !
0	i have recently_bought a new rolex_explorer 0 from iconic_watches for my dad .
0	i must_say that they are my jewellers for every watch i bought in the past and will also be in the near_future .
0	the sales and customer service team is awesome and so helpful .
0	once again thanks team iconic_watches .
0	regards

0	i '_ve been using juno for a decade or so , in which time i dread to think how much money i have spent !
0	my sagging bank_balance is testament to juno and their excellent service !
0	if it says it is in stock it is .
0	orders placed by mid - afternoon ( nearly ) always arrive next_day .
0	when i have had a handful of problems they have been sorted painlessly , juno covering any return postage_costs .
0	the back in stock , artist and label alerts are great and ensure you never miss anything from your favourite labels and artists .
0	the focus had widened from the original " dance_music resource " tag , reflecting increasingly eclectic tastes .
0	this broader remit hasn_'_t affected quality in terms of service or stock carried .
0	i would ( and do ) recommend juno widely !
0	cheers !
0	received my order quickly .
0	everything was packaged carefully and the sweet with the order was a great little touch !
0	i '_ve been in the customer_care game for 00 years and i am impressed .
0	you '_ve gained another customer here !
0	many_thanks !
0	used chilli for a stag_party of 00 in chester .
0	lots of options when booking , tailored to our needs .
0	venue was excellent , chester is awesome !
0	well_organised , well set_up , ran very smoothly , no_problems , no_hitches , everything in place as we asked for , perfect for a stag_do .
0	would use again no problem .
0	i '_ve been using shopto for over a year .
0	i can_honestly_say i '_ve not had one problem , just discounts and fantastic delivery and general service .
0	so i say why shop anywhere_else when you can shopto . net ?
0	this site is good
0	i was " unlucky " to get the item of the wrong_colour from this online store , but the way they responed to my problem was most pleasing .
0	not only was the item replaced with a correct one , but i also got a refund for the return shipping .
0	responses to my messages were fast , accurate and polite .
0	overall - the best online shopping_experience i '_ve had .
0	it '_s that kind of situations when you can see if the store is worth returning to .
0	this one - definitely is .
0	have been with this company for too damn long and have had a wide_array of problems over the years .
0	my connection used to drop completely on a regular_basis requiring a manual reset of the router .
0	this problem continued for a while but seemed to get better in the last_year ... until about one month_ago .
0	speeds have been dropping since .
0	they gave_me a replacement router which has_been performing worse than the one which was at_least 0 years old .
0	i regularly have to deal with speeds which are 000 times worse than what is being paid for .
0	that is not an exaggeration either , literally 000 times worse .
0	ping is often incredibly high meaning going near an on - line video_game is something that i cannot even consider any more , and streaming youtube_videos has_become a chore rather_than a form of entertainment .
0	on top of all this , their customer_support_team have been fairly useless : they take_forever to respond to emails , they respond to tweets quickly ... but there tweets consist of " fill out this form so we can email you ", they are very blunt and rude over the phone , and they leave you praying that odin rides down to earth on his eight legged horse to batter you in the face with his spear .
0	( not a euphemism ).
0	would love to leave the service but can '_t as they force you to pay a large fee for every_month left on the contract .
0	recently switched to fibre_broadband and had an issue with the connection .
0	was transferred to 0 different people and spoke to them for 0 hours - useless !
0	ee management are absolutely incompetent - there seems to be very little proper training .
0	oh and not to mention the fact that they completely forgot to connect me to the landline service , but expected me to pay !
0	ha !
0	jokes .
0	a little_sceptical at first , mostly due to the many unprofessional looking promotional links floating about !
0	... but after dealing_with cosmeparadise , i can say that they are a truly reputable_company who offer competitive_prices and quick delivery ( although longer_than usual due to coming from_hk ).
0	i ' d definitely use them again ; a very quick and easy service .
0	prices competitive and lots of clubcard_points to be had !
0	i ordered gta 0 about a week before release day and paid for it straight_away though paypal , then i saw online that rockstar had said no online_retailer is to dispatch the game till the 00th of september lucky i picked dpd to delver and got it on release day .
0	now i will use shop to all the time
0	great customer service a ++++++++++++++ company
0	having_shopped with myprotein and bodybuilding . com in the past , i feel bodybuilding_warehouse offers a fantastic range of their own supplements and foodstuffs as well as stocking some of my favourite_brands such as gaspari and bsn .
0	the service and delivery has_been faultless every time and this , coupled_with very competitive_pricing , makes for a company that i would recommend to anyone and will be using time and again .
0	fantastic !
0	the service was very quick and straight to the facts .
0	i compared the price offered to other comparitable websites and mazuma_mobile was by far the best .
0	personally i used the bank_transfer method of payment and only had to wait a couple of days .
0	i would absolutely recommend mazuma to anyone .
0	steve jobs made this company the business that it is today and it shows throughout everything they make and sale .
0	love this company to bits and wish that every business would look to what this company stands for - true innovation =)
0	sorry , i '_ve been an ebay buyer but also a big seller and the fees are crazy .
0	on ebay , i first pay insertion , then final value fees of over 00_% and then paypal_fees of 0 %.
0	it '_s complete madness but since they have such a grip on this sector , we have no - one to choose .
0	great for buyers , horrible_horrible place for sellers !
0	!
0	very slow when processing orders , i know you are a big company but make it faster so i can be a happier customers !!!!
0	!
0	got a compatible ps0_controller for £_00 . 00 delivered to my door , excellent price and excellent service .
0	would highly_recommended , good chaps to deal with and answered all my queries .
0	thank_you again guys , very happy customer =)
0	light / smoke machine was exactly as_described .
0	delivery was quick and i was able to track the progress of the delivery .
0	would recommend this seller as service was a0 .
0	great service , fast and smooth delivery , excellent product , really good price , cheaper_than ebay .
0	thanks

0	a huge thanks to oak_furniture_land for their fantastic products and flawless customer service .
0	we ' re absolutely_delighted with our new dining_table and chairs - which wonderfully match the solid_oak_sideboard we bought from them earlier in the year .
0	the quality is excellent for such a low price tag and free delivery was a bonus .
0	we spent_ages researching furniture companies before_deciding to buy from oak_furniture_land back in feb .
0	it was our first time purchasing furniture from an online company and naturally we were rather cautious - however after_reading nearly every_single review available , we decided we were in safe_hands - and evidently so , since spending over £ 0 , 000 with oak_furniture_land , i haven_'_t got a bad_word to say against them .
0	we received emails and text_messages to confirm our order and booking details ... we were given a 0 hour time_slot and the drivers even phoned me 00_mins before they arrived to let_me know they were near .
0	they were both extremely polite and helpful - nothing seemed to be too much_trouble for them !
0	so thanks again , oak_furniture_land - i expect we '_ll be dealing_with you again soon !
0	i '_ve bought several books now from the book_depository and have been impressed with their customer service each time .
0	they are quick to respond to emails and delivery was tip_top - v . quick .
0	i highly_recommend this company .
0	mary at catered ski chalet was amazing .
0	she answered all our awkward_questions always got back to me straight_away , was always patient with me getting in touch with all my group and did not hound me about getting back to her straight_away .
0	we had an awkward number of 0 and she was excellent at giving us the best prices for empty bed supplements and basically did all she could to ensure that we got the best for our money .
0	then finally when we did book she emailed me to say that she had managed to get the options we wanted even cheaper_than we had agreed by adding some offers .
0	cant_wait to go on our holiday , if it is as good as the service mary gave_us then we are in for a perfect week .
0	a free game every day plus exciting prizes and free chat games to be won .
0	what more do you want , think im addicted .
0	the hosts are wonderful and brilliant .
0	if you gamble sensibly youll love virgin_games .......
0	its been a month since my flight was cancelled and expedia will still not refund my money .... circa_£ 0000 !
0	they never called back when promised and they now tell me that they can '_t help and to contact the airline directly .
0	i thought it was supposed to be customer service ?
0	feel like expedia will use any excuse to never give me back my money and this was compounded when i read in the guardian an article about how they stall on refunds , google it .
0	will never book through expedia .
0	ordering was easy and was contacted very quickly to confirm order .
0	was advised of eta but watch came before that via a pre 0pm saturday delivery which was great .
0	am absolutely over the moon with my new watch and would definitely use swd again .
0	i did have reservations_about ordering a high value item online but saw previous reviews and read up on this company and very pleased with the end_result .
0	tried others and was not impressed but mazuma was a no_nonsense effecient way of going about selling my old phone .
0	will recommend and use again and again .
0	worst . company . ever !
0	no joke i would never use these_guys , no help in a dispute from a buyer point of view and even worse for holding_onto your money as a seller .
0	i know they work close with ebay but they should not be legally allowed to handle money !
0	every experience makes me more and more certain they don_'_t give two hoots about its user '_s , and i thought the uk banks were bad ... paypal take the biscuit , im taking a case to the financial_ombudsman as we speak , after that i am closing my account and will never use or have anything to do with paypal again .
0	avoid at all costs .
0	i have always received my orders in a timely_fashion , plus they have an instant compare pricing tool that instantly saves you 0 % and you can always google and find a $ 0 off coupon .
0	now we get to the closeouts and samples portion , wow .
0	from free_shakers to pill dispensers , not to mention tons of $ 0 -$ 0 items great to try out things you '_ve been thinking_about , and sometimes , full serving sizes ( yes thats 00 - 00 multivitamins , libido enhancers , etc ).
0	i have zero_complaints , and don_'_t forget to visit their facebook_page often , they are constantly doing free_giveaways featuring incredible supplement packages .
0	even_though i '_ve never won , i will always support them !
0	sw for life !
0	they already have the lowest_prices you '_ll find on high_quality supplements , plus they '_ll drop it even lower_than websites matching that price .
0	extremely fast free shipping , free_giveaways , free_shaker_cups w_/ every order -- can '_t be beat !
0	cut a long_story_short : needed to send a package to the us .
0	went to the local post_office and they asked for silly money .
0	decided to go to parcel0go and spoke to a very lovely assistant called catherine who managed to get me a good price .
0	really made my day :)
0	thank_you
0	a cracking stag_weekend and katie our organiser was fantastic throughout the booking process .
0	several options we offered and when we selected our weekend we were able to customise it to individual needs across our group .
0	the activity centre chosen for shooting , assault course and bo - carts ( go - karts in mud ) was fantastic too .
0	well_done and i would not_hesitate to recommend chillisauce for anyone_wishing to book a stag_weekend .
0	after spending millions on a redesign , the new beeb site is top - of - the pops in terms of usability .
0	design and layout imho
0	i '_m caught in a search filter bubble , seeing different resutls from everyone_else due to my ip_address , despite disabling personalization .
0	not a happy_camper .
0	the site is updated every 00 seconds with results from all of the major and minor soccer leagues worldwide .
0	the site gives good detailed_information on each match , including goal / card / times , who scored or was sent off and so on .
0	always use feel good for my contact_lense solution , their prices are always the best on the net & their delivery is always really quick !
0	will_continue to use again & again .
0	my order arrived super quick , i chose my protein as when compared to other_websites their vitamins were of superior quality and cheaper , what more could you want .
0	will_def be re - ordering .
0	thanks so much !
0	at less_than £_00 for 0 people for a years cover inc winter sports look no further .
0	the winter sports package inc damage and loss to equipment .
0	mega .
0	just bought a jet boil from them .
0	cheapest price out there .
0	had it in less_than 0 days .
0	emails from_start to finish .
0	will buy again from this store .
0	great service right from the start .
0	kept_informed all the way by email .
0	i '_ve_used parcel0go now several_times and will_continue to use them in the future , it '_s a fantastic service and the prices are extremely reasonable .
0	you get to pick the courier you wish to deliver the parcel and some can just be taken to local drop_off points so it saves waiting it all day for someone come collect it .
0	i '_ve also now used the live_chat as i made a mistake with the post_code , [_name_] sorted this instantly and new labels were emailed to me within 0 minutes !!!
0	faultless service with a very polite attitude .
0	i hope i get [_name_] again if i ever have to use live_chat :)
0	we booked chillisauce based on their glossy website .
0	firstly , the activities ( quad_biking , hovercraft and rage karts ) were a total_rip_off - less_than 0mins driving for £_000 !!
0	it was a joke and people were really disappointed , many having travelled from abroad .
0	their representative jamie was extremely rude and did not want to know as soon as we ' d paid the deposits .
0	between the group of us we must have tried to phone him over 00 times and he '_s never available and never returns calls .
0	he was rude to the stag '_s aunt who phoned from abroad trying to pay for her_husband and hung_up the phone on her .
0	when we tried to add extra people a few_days before the event he said " this event has_been too much hassle , i '_m not letting anyone extra come ".
0	he made mistakes on the names and said it was too confusing that they shared the same surnames ( cousins / brothers ) and he couldn_'_t figure_out who had / hadn_'_t paid .
0	on the day we had to take bank_statements to prove that we ' d paid since jamie would not recognise that people had paid and their names should have been on the list .
0	we tried to complain afterwards but chilli_sauce have no_complaints process and we suffered verbal abuse from jamie accusing us of being disorganised (!?
0	).
0	in addition he organised a hen night for my wife who was lead bridesmaid for her friend .
0	this was a shambles too with them repeatedly trying to call him and confusion when they arrived at their hotel .
0	again their activities were a rip_off , only a few minutes on each thing despite paying alot .
0	avoid chilli_sauce .
0	in particular avoid jamie - its a disgrace .
0	fantastic customer service .
0	after royal_mail losing my parcel , jokers_masquerade displayed an unprecedented level of customer service to help me sort_out the problem and i cannot thank them enough , in particular jessica for her help and understanding .
0	thumbs_up !
0	and thank_you so much .
0	very happy with purchase .
0	a wide_range of glasses and excellent service .
0	would recommend to everyone .
0	definitely use them again .
0	thanks
0	i buy from these_guys everytime i need supplements .
0	i only online shop @ amazon . com " except my supplements " only supplement_warehouse has the bang for the buk ... thx
0	very professional company and would definitely come_back
0	i '_ve had cause to ask lcn a number of queries and every time had fast and excellent responses .
0	very high_level of customer service .
0	good product selection and fast delivery
0	00 enquiries in 0 days .
0	very impressed .
0	i '_ve ordered lots of things from amazon over the years from a few_quid to hundreds of pounds .
0	i never had an issue , the 0st time ever i had a faulty item a few weeks_ago and i '_ve sent it back to get a refund , they even paid the postage for it !
0	i also have to add that the item has_been purchased on the website but not actually sold by amazon and i trully believe it was a genuinely faulty item .
0	so much so , that i might order the same thing again , when i get my money back .
0	newlaters can be a bit of a hassle , but if you don_'_t want to read it , you just delete it .
0	i built my computer recently and ordered parts from a few different websites .
0	box had the best communication ( text_messages , etc .
0	), fast and free delivery without minimum spending .
0	and the best price for the item in question .
0	i would surely recommend to anyone .
0	i needed to re - book a collection a number of times and sam at parcel0go couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
0	i contacted parcel0go via their facebook_page and the issue was resolved v quickly .
0	i got a highly professional service so would definitely recommend !!
0	!
0	cheap get aways ... thanks
0	i was shopping around for creatine .
0	i '_ve_used supplement_warehouse in the past and it has always been a site i checked when shopping and checking prices .
0	i ordered con - cret caps and it was a buy one get on free deal .. and the one i had to pay for was still cheaper_than any other site '_s .
0	i really recommend shopping with them .
0	was very easy to order and set a delivery date .
0	thanks
0	would recommend .
0	... and they were very quick to delivery tv , two_days window appointment .
0	but decided to cancel and it just took one simple phone_call and it was done .
0	didn_'_t even ask why i wanted to cancel but seemed strange !
0	!
0	.. from my order .
0	ordered a pc_components to build my own pc .
0	took delivery and started to build my pc that day i took delivery .
0	everything was going fine until i came to installing the drives and noticed that the dvd - rom is missing from the order ???
0	?
0	i lived alone then , and contacted them and i was told that i might have misplaced it shown where ???
0	?
0	anyway , they finally agreed to meet me half way and i was told that they are willing to send me a dvd - rom drive if i was happy to pay half it '_s price plus postage which seemed really unfair .
0	if you get an order from scan , make_sure you check everything or they will scam you !
0	you ahve been_warned !
0	faz
0	.. network_provider , love them .
0	thanks for the excellent customer_services you ' re providing .
0	faz
0	... money collected and validated , then suddenly , they ' re out of stock .
0	completely_unacceptable .
0	i placed my order on the 00th_dec 00 as tv was shown in stock , my order was processed and validated and money requested from cc company and when i was tracing the progress of my order , they were out of stock and have received an e_- mail to say that the manufacture will send them more on the 0nd_jan 00 and if not happy then i can cancel my order .
0	this shows how much they really appreciate your business .
0	it ’_s like they ’ re saying “ either wait_till when ever and get lost ” this is not a way to do_business .
0	i placed my order based on your stock_availability according to your website , if your website is not shown the true stock count then fix it and get a decent website up .
0	so i cancelled my order and cancellation was processed as it was confirmed by e_- mail .
0	shortly_after , the tv was shown in stock again !!!!
0	a minute later , it was out of stock again !!!
0	properly when i cancelled , they ’ ve updated their website so another customer orders , they take their cc_details down and then e_- mail them that the tv is out of stock .
0	seriously , you need to get a decent website and try and keep your customers rather then push them away and lower your delivery charges , £_00 for delivery is a daylight rubbery .
0	thanks
0	faz
0	found this site 0_weeks_ago , book marked it to keep tabs on a specific item i wanted that appeared to be out of stock like everwhere else ( asus infinty 000 tablet , with english dock !!)
0	i emailed gogodigital and was assured re - stockig was quite regular , and with a better price than any other uk retailer i was happy to wait , 00hours later , item in stock , following a simple hassle_free online purchase and with next working day delivery , well_packaged , this item works_perfectly with all the promised upgrades and warranty ( i '_m super happy and using it right now ).
0	with the autumn approaching and my old coat no_longer up to the task i thought it was time for a change .
0	i contacted 0 shops for advice , the 0st one got back to me with a recommendation of a £_000 jacket , that on checking was absolutely no good for me at all , as it was just a thin pro shell , probably better for their sales than me .
0	white and bishop however hit the nail on the head with the north_face atlas tri - climate jacket - quickly delivered the jacket is amazing , warm , dry , 0 - 0 love it to bits .
0	my wife who_hates spending money loved the coat so much i had to order her one in gravity purple along with 0 sets of north_face etip gloves , pair for me and pair for her .
0	super service throughout with a team who put your needs 0st , you would be crazy to go_elsewhere .
0	now looking at a pair of hiking_shoes also !
0	took roughly a week to dispatch a ' in stock ' item ..... then had to wait 0 - 0 days for product to arrive .
0	tried to contact through website ..... no one bothered to reply .... although conveniently a day after i sent message product was despatched .
0	product was stated as new but missing xbox seal and was poorly shrink_wrapped .... looked like a bodge job .
0	disc was loose_inside case ... rattling_around in there .. wasn_'_t seated properly .
0	was actually really dissatisfied .. but i do not know why i bothered writing this review as simply_games won_'_t actually do anything about it .
0	bought many things from ebuyer over the years , never had a problem with delivery and always found some cracking_deals .
0	really easy to use service , very quick delivery and cheapest online around for a limited time only .
0	would use again !
0	overclockers uk have amazing customer service , quick delivery and a very decent forum website should you need after care .
0	never had a problem ordering from them and they are one of my best trusted retailers for online shopping .
0	i bought guild_wars 0 ( cheapest anywhere online !)
0	key was with me in 0 mins , worked_perfectly !.
0	the site is very easy to use could not recommend higher .
0	i found the website to be very easy to use , and greatly_appreciated the 000 free business_cards offer .
0	delivery was very quick . the cards are of great quality and are just what i was looking for .
0	i will_definitely be using easyprint again !
0	greatcompany .
0	fast delivery
0	great company with great deals and quality shipping times !
0	excellent service , excellent communication .
0	sent immediately and arrived next_day .
0	had a change of address and they gave excellent communication and had it redelivered .
0	the dinner_jacket and trousers were great quality too .
0	watchshop delivered the wrong item .
0	watchshop delayed sending the correct item until receipt back of the wrong item , therefore missing my christmas deadline .
0	slow reply to emails .
0	no answer by phone .
0	terrible !
0	neanderthal royal_mail postman couldn_'_t fit the lenses package through our standard sized letterbox , even_though i somehow could .
0	easily .
0	three re - delivery attempts later with the same incompetent result i had to go and collect from a delivery office in the middle of nowhere at expense to myself .
0	great service .
0	in future i will buy lenses from my local_optician , where i can pick them up easily and not be forced to be at the mercy of criminal stupidity .
0	absolutely amazingservice .
0	i received an e_- mail at every_step and there we no_problems_whatsoever .
0	really good next_day shipping .
0	the delivery tracking thing was really useful and easy to use .
0	i received texts to confirm when my package would be arriving .
0	well_packaged and wrapped .
0	product arrived in perfect_condition .
0	definitely one of the best online shopping_experiences .
0	stress - free and faultless !
0	köpte en soffa portugal för en tid sedan .
0	soffan kom snabbt dock tappar den formen och så fattades det skruvar .
0	men jag antar att man_får vad man betalar för :-_d
0	i ordered the incorrect remote , emailed a total of 0 times to all 0 email_addresses shown on their site , 0 email_addresses bounced_back .
0	called their phone number several_times , but kept giving message only open between_0am to 00 . 00am and 0pm to 0pm despite me ringing during their so called opening times .
0	i also contacted via the message box on the order details page .
0	they then shipped the order out despite my many emails that seemed to go through .
0	won_'_t be using again
0	i did not receive my items and terence_paul was not interested in helping in any way luckily i got my money back through my card i would never use them again
0	even when several people complain to sage_pay that a company is taking money for products that they have no_intention of providing , sage_pay are happy to keep providing that company with the means to continue its dodgy business_practices .
0	good service good signal not all the call_centres are in asia and you can actually understand the people you talk to
0	excerlant company defonatly sell more phones with you
0	do not use this company .
0	we bought 0 club level ( executive ) tickets for the arsenal v man u game on the 00nd_jan . we paid £ 0 , 000_pounds for the five tickets .
0	tickets were only delivered on the friday_afternoon before the match and when they arrived they were not even club level tickets , they were regular tickets priced at £_00 each and were located in the away side .
0	onlineticketexpress promised to refund the difference but after several emails and phone_calls we have still had no response or any type of refund .
0	cheaters & criminals
0	no special_offers , no loyalty_points , no tokens > they don_'_t need it everything is already at the right price , tryit !
0	a weekly_shop in aldi is about a third of the cost in the major_supermarkets .
0	i then go to marks for my " bits " .
0	best of both_worlds
0	bunch of bandits !
0	try and buy one yoghurt or one pizza , bacon , sausage etc - there '_s always offers to make you buy more than you could ever eat before it goes off .
0	all they do is try increase the amount you buy .
0	why not just make the price for a single item cheap so we can choose how many we want to buy and not you .
0	what a great web_site !
0	evrything in stock , everything delivered packed well .
0	you get your stuff next_day and when i phoned up there were actually people on the phone who packed my order !
0	terrific !
0	they knew all about homebrew as well as could answer my questions !
0	even th eemail replies were quick and helpful .
0	i have no_worries_about them and you won_'_t either !
0	its service is not really bad .. but some times it delays the delivery too much .
0	but in the end my product reaches safe to me ..
0	oh man .
0	what an awsome site .
0	look at all the products .
0	its really amaizing .. good work people .
0	keep it up .
0	this is an average site .
0	there is not much latest material .
0	the privacy_settings are really awkward now as its harder not to share everything with everyone ... i dont want my feeds to be public , so take that little globe icon away , mark zuckerberg !
0	just cos you like to share everything doesnt mean that we do .
0	facebook should be for sharing with who you want .
0	the fact that usernames cant be changed more than once means that people can look me up by my username if they cant find me in public searches !
0	p . a . n . t . s
0	the online customer service provided instant and helpful advice !
0	!
0	no_problems whenever i use this company .
0	good communication , quick enough delivery and reasonable prices .
0	i never have any issue with ordering or the products from my protein .
0	they are not always the cheapest but thye have agood range , are no_frills and keep a tight delivery and communication schedule .
0	i will use again .
0	i ordered protein from firstchoicesuppliments as it offered the best price for a bulk purchase that i could_find anywhere on the internet .
0	it arrived very quickly but unfortunately the contents had suffered some damage .
0	i contacted firstchoice and they remedied the situation with replacement products the very next_day .
0	i am very happy to see this level of service which is definitely not the standard offered by lots of other_companies .
0	definitely recommend their services and would use them again .
0	i can '_t recommend fd plumbing enough - they turn_up when they say they will , do the job quickly and efficiently , leave no mess behind and charge very reasonable rates which are quoted before the work takes place .
0	it shouldn_'_t be remarkable to find a company who keep their promises and get the job_done properly , along with being friendly , easy to deal with and honest ; but it is !
0	i '_m very happy with all of the work completed so_far , and will_definitely be using them again in future .
0	contact earlier in the week to return my glasses require a rma_number .
0	automated emailed received then nothing .
0	emailed again still nothing .
0	they say their customer_support_team aims to respond to your query within 00_hours , monday to friday .
0	the website says
0	" we provide a high_level of after sales service , which includes a guaranteed return_policy ."
0	service received has_been very poor and still no contact from anyone regarding the rma_number which is needed to make the return .
0	this company seems to be one of the cheapest on the web , however once you place your order it will remain as processed for many days .
0	when you call their customer service ( which you cant call from a mobile ) it will state that your in a que and approx wait is 00min .
0	i still havnt received my order ( a digital_camera ), and it seems impossible to get in touch with them .
0	never use this site , pay a bit more for piece of mind .
0	this , from_start to delivery was perfect ,
0	the web_interface is intuitive , easy to use and provides all the alignment tool you could want .
0	especially like the fact it will warn you if the uploaded picture is a low resolution and not suitable for printing .
0	from submitting my print i was kept_informed of the dispatch and delivery and was amazed that it was with me in less_than a week
0	if you want a canvas_print , these are the guys ( and girls ) to do it
0	although it took a couple hours more than the 0hours stated b / c of issues with the carrier , i was happy that the company kept me informed of the progress .
0	they promptly unlocked it and notified me accordingly once possible .
0	very happy customer .
0	jolly good service - very impressed with the speed and no_fuss service / delivery - if only every supplier would be the same
0	dont_waste your money with any other provider as the platform and service will not be as good as feedoptimise .
0	if you know how to turn on a pc , launch the internet and create an account with these sites ... then don_’_t waste your money .
0	the social_media blue print is definitely not for companies who want to attract new business , all the tutorials tell you is what each social_networking site does , it has no depth what so ever .
0	made a reservation a week before needing the vehicle , phoned 0 times during the week to confirm booking as i needed it for house_move .
0	each time they confirmed the booking but they did not fill me with confidence that the van would arrive .
0	on the day of moving_house it came to 00 :_00am when the van should have arrived at 00am so i phoned and they said the vehicle had engine problems and won_’_t be delivered .
0	unbelievable not even a phone_call to say the vehicle wouldn ’_t be arriving !
0	also they refunded the money less £ 0 !
0	avoid this company !
0	thanks guys that was really easy to do

0	sent my phone off last_week on wednesday , didn_'_t hear nothing , sent them a message today , never replied , absolutly disappointed .
0	shame on you .

0	fast and informational .

0	i have come_back now multiple_times and i really love this website .
0	highly_recommended !
0	i needed a convertible to drive from vegas to san_francisco via los_angeles , most companies gave_me ridiculous quotes as the drop_off location was different from the pick - up but these_guys came up with the goods .
0	i was told about this site from a friend of mine and when i got to it , i was amazed .
0	the closeouts , cheap prices , selection ... definitely beat the big_name stores .
0	i '_ll be using this site from now on , might as well throw_away my gnc card !
0	!
0	excellent service my phone actually took longer to arrive and my sale date was over by a few_days even_though my phone had dropped in price by this time i still got the full_amount offered originally !
0	ordered my pc using the 0 day fast track service ended_up having some slight delays which lead to my pc been dispatched in 0 days rather_than 0 , got a full_refund for the fast track but still got my pc super quick !
0	:)
0	overall the service throughout the process was excellent and the end product is amazing not a single_complaint .
0	finally a london cleaning company that delivers perfect results every time .
0	housekeep has exceeded_expectation in every_respect and in particular in relation to the high_quality / reliability of the cleaners and the exceptional levels of customer service .
0	i have personally recommended housekeep to all my family , friends and colleagues .
0	i had the chance to us 00days . com and it was a great experience .
0	it is a completely hassle_free service that helped_me to get_rid off my grandmother potteries and rise some money .
0	just great !
0	i '_ve been using hostelbookers for a long time now , and prefer it to hostelworld because of the lack of booking_fee .
0	there has never been any_problems with any of the bookings i '_ve made .
0	incredible !
0	less_than 0 hours and my iphone was unlocked !
0	i strongly_recommend it !
0	thanks
0	i had a delivery arranged for valentines_day to deliver to my partners work address .
0	i had her wait there until 0pm but unfortunately the flowers didn_'_t arrived until after this time ( this was a friday_night and so they were not picked_up until the monday ).
0	not only were they delivered outside of the agreed delivery time but office security told my partner they were thrown inside the door without_any care by the courier .
0	needless to say i was very disappointed .
0	i tried_contacting them via the ticketing_system and weeks_later no reply except for them to close the ticket as resolved .
0	the delivery issue is something they need to look at with the courier but the lack of customer service is unacceptable especially_considering the cost of the flowers .
0	myprotein offers a wide_range of products in different_flavours and sizes .
0	the prices are very competitive and in particular the protein is comparitavley cheap .
0	there is a good level of information and atricles to provide much needed knowledge and the customer reviews help balance opinion .
0	finally there is a wide_range of delivey options that generally arrive very quickly .
0	i have made 0 orders from here so_far and both have arrived very quickly with no issue at all .
0	first order was for a 000 chrome angled drip tip adaptor as after buying 0 boxmods i needed an angled tip but i '_m not fond of the knucklehead type ones .
0	second order was for 0 batteries after i purchased the itazte vtr from another vendor ( batteries much_cheaper here ) i purchased 0 batteries here for the same price as 0 cost on another site so definitely got it right .
0	look_forward to further use in the future .
0	very easy to use site and has quite a good selection of mods available from beginner to more experienced vaper .
0	i have ordered 0 times from here .
0	my 0 orders are as follows
0	0

0	0
0	vtr by innokin
0	blue crush 00ml
0	battery case by xtar
0	i used the next_day recorded delivery for this order as i wanted the vtr to arrive asap and also it covered me for £_000 of goods , it arrived with no issue , the blue crush 00ml was purchased after trying the flavour in the test pack .

0	aluminium drip tips coloured 000 / ego by uk ecig store blue
0	victory bcc 0ml tank by vision blue
0	victory bcc 0ml tank by vision black
0	000 - to - ego adaptor by uk ecig store
0	unitank by kangertech blue
0	decided that i wanted some new tanks so purchased the above ones and also purchased a new drip tip as i haven_'_t bought a new one for a while .
0	used the 0nd_class signed for delivery option for this as i was in no rush , still arrive in the same time as usual 00 / 00hrs after i ordered .
0	i have also had a discount_code i have used for each order saving me a few_quid each time and better still , with every order i have made i have received a 0ml bottle of eliquid to trial ( different flavour each time ) free of charge of course .
0	i will_continue to use this company as i have had no issue and i know many people that use them with no issue also .
0	sorry to read the bad_reviews on here from other people tho as it is never nice having a bad_experience .
0	i '_ve bought many different eliquids from here and always had a quality product arrive , packaged well and always comes on time .
0	i '_ve gone back several_times for more as the prices are tidy as is the service .
0	from buying to refunding and general technical help , overclockers . co . uk are exceptional , i '_ve been shopping with them for 0 years_now and since caseking . de took them over their service has gotten even better .
0	if your in the market for anything related to computers then ocuk should be your first step .
0	my first order from powerbody was my usual supps list , animal pack and kre - alkalyn but cheaper which i was happy about , delivery was very fast , early next_day , the staff are very helpful as they themselves are passionate_about training and bodybuilding and their forums are a great place to share and get knowledge with the community :)
0	first time user of printerland , i '_m an it consultant and a customer asked me to look into reducing their printing costs , i started researching it myself an called printerland for a quote , i was surprised to find that the sales_rep was very knowledgeable and willingly gave a lot of advice and recommended the same printer that i had singled out .
0	service was brilliant and product arrived within_00h .
0	couldn_'_t ask for more
0	i found this site and thought it was sketch at first with the low_prices of a whiteline roll kit priced 00 - 00 bucks below everyone_else .
0	i then did some_research and found this site is legit and tried them out .
0	i got my tracking_number quick and fast .
0	then got my products in the mail in just under a week .
0	vr is my new site for parts !!
0	highly_recommended !
0	!
0	order number : 0000
0	realy good service and good postal service
0	i have previously purchased products in the superdry store , but this was my first online purchase .
0	the product arrived within 0 days of ordering and the product was exactly_what i expected .
0	really pleased with the service .
0	i recently_purchased " hitman : absolution " from one of the bargains as it was the cheapest price at the time of purchase by almost 0 £ which to me is a bargain for such a good game .
0	i ordered the product on the 00th_june after the usual dispatch time so i didn_'_t receive my dispatch confirmation until the 00th_june , but it arrived on the 00th_june .
0	this is a next_day delivery and i am happy with the service provided , this was also a first time purchase .
0	i '_ll be glad to order from them again !
0	great service , great deals and fast delivery .
0	i bought a twin_pack of " army of two : the devil '_s cartel " arrived exactly when i expected and nothing was wrong with the packaging .
0	i couldn_'_t believe_how cheap it turned_out to be with first_class delivery .
0	getting both games at a modest price of 00 . 00 £ it worked out so much_cheaper for me and my friend .
0	i ordered a chair but what i got was two rods due to some misslabeling but tackleuk fixed this promptly and sent me a new chair and allowed_me to keep the two rods for free !
0	great and fast service !
0	one of the best for eliquid
0	i believe they have bogus bidders that get you to pay a deposit by paypal that can never be returned as paypal always settle a dispute in there favour as it is an electronic none tangible service !!
0	!
0	use them at your_peril .
0	ordered a jacket they had in stock on the saturday for next_day delivery ( arriving tuesday ) now over a week has passed and no jacket no reply to my 0 emails and no reply to my 0 voice_mail messages .
0	they make out on there web_site that there is a sales desk between 00am and 0pm mon - sat straight to voice - mail all week !!
0	!
0	there are definatly more trusted and reliable sites !!
0	!
0	they made a special effort to get my package to me on a saturday next_day delivery , i wasn_’_t expecting that and was very happy .

0	i booked a hotel_room the day before my stay using the ebookers website and received confirmation .
0	i arrived at the hotel to be told they were fully booked with no rooms available .
0	as i '_m_sure you '_ll agree this is very very poor service .
0	how impersonal can you get with serenata_flowers .
0	0 / flowers arrive delivered in a box .
0	0 / left with reception and just left without passing them to my wife .
0	i could have dumped them on reception for that matter .
0	0 / i paid an extra 00 for grandissimo option , expecting beautiful white blossoms to break up the dozen_red_roses .
0	nothing , just a bunch or roses , shoved together .
0	definitely not grandissimo .
0	0 / the flowers were wrapped in the most basic of wrapping papers , very disappointed .
0	ive spent far less at flower shops and got a lot more .
0	will never buy from here again or off the internet come to that matter .
0	service doesn_'_t exist .
0	just good at confirming your order taken and delivery thats all you get .
0	delivered my parcel to the wrong place , had it signed by someone in the wrong name who promptly stole it and i never got to see it again .
0	no customer service available at all .
0	this company is literally the worst .
0	never never use them .
0	honestly shopto is my favourite place to buy games .
0	prices are always reasonable but the service is just fantastic .
0	everything i pre order always arrives in time for release day , everything else arrives the next_day always in great condition .
0	whenever i contact customer service with any kind of questions i always get a prompt , friendly and helpful reply .
0	you usually get a photograph of your parcel within minutes of ordering and their 0 minute dispatch promise actually works .
0	couldn_'_t recommend them to anyone enough .
0	great value for money ; a fast , efficient and friendly service ; very good customer loyalty and satisfaction ; brilliant weekly_deals and most_importantly of all , it is great , tasty , healthy_food .
0	you ' d be mad not to try it if you like healthy , tasty_food !
0	really good range of smells for guys and all at very good discounts for the brands that they offer .
0	the delivery came within a few_days of ordering in the original wrapping and packaging which one always has to question when you ' re not buying a product from its original source - absolutely nothing wrong with this one though .
0	in terms of the scent , i bought acqua di gio for the summer and i ' d very much recommend that for a guy_who doesn_'_t know what he wants but wants something fresh and that will turn heads !
0	love onnit .
0	aubrey has smart people doing a great job and his open mindedness will keep this company prevalent until the big volcano blows .
0	times are tight right now for me .
0	i have been trying to get the most nutrients out of food to avoid buying supplements .
0	but with an_upcoming competition , i have to suck it up and go to the place i trust .
0	they are very transparent .
0	they give free stuff every time i order .
0	low_prices on little extra things .
0	people complain that they charge for shipping but i don_'_t expect a free hand job after a complimentary massage .
0	sorry , that '_s the only analogy i had .
0	i wouldn_'_t pay for one either .
0	they are competitive in business and i am competitive in life .
0	respect .
0	applied for a free water saving bag to go inside toilet_cistern .
0	was delivered on time and in perfect_condition .

0	i have made a couple of purchases from facewest . co . uk and i just wanted to tell that facewest will always be my favorite shop when buying my outdoor_gear .
0	muy conforme con_el_servicio , fue practico , simple y eficiente .
0	saludos !
0	everything arrived on time , with minimal_effort on my part .
0	the money was in my account with a week !!
0	great service that i would recommend to anyone .
0	etyres offer a fantastic service and have great prices too .
0	so much easy as they come to you .
0	i have nothing good to say about bt as a customer for the last 00 years .
0	rip_off_merchants plain and simple .
0	signed_up with hma and was constantly disconnected , contacted customer_support who through some correspondence was unable to rectify the issues with this very buggy software , then told no refund offered as under the term and conditions i exceeded the 000 connections ?
0	while being encouraged to do so by customer_support as a diagnostic procedure , a very cunning piece of advice , opened paypal case and got a refund as case went in my favor .... please read the terms and conditions before_committing , my experience is just avoid this company as there are much_better and cheaper out there ..... on the whole a very bad_experience .
0	cheers paypal
0	i used music magpies app on my iphone which was quick and easy to use !
0	( so_far so good ) after accepting a poor offer on what was a outstanding collection of dvds ( in top nick ).
0	i then boxed up my dvds incl .
0	0 game which was worth £_00 .
0	the courier picked_up my boxes ( yeah a random bloke in a normal car ) who gave_me a slip to say he had collected them .
0	00 days_later they showed up at the warehouse as ' under quality checking '.
0	then i got an offer of under £_00 .
0	this was because apparently the two most expensive dvds / game on the list were either ' damaged ' or ' not sent '.
0	i know for a fact all items were send and all in top nick !
0	i have still not heard_anything by day 00 and they have not replied to either of my 0 emails sent 0_weeks_ago which they say response time is 00hrs .
0	in fact the second email i sent stated i would review they ' re company on every website if i don_'_t get a response ( obviously not a big deal for them then ).
0	this company does not hold the customer at the center of its values and will rob you of higher priced dvds !
0	i recon that the people below that have rated this company as 0 * are not actual people but the company itself !
0	it has to be !
0	my friend at work has also had this same problem as me and we done it the same time .
0	i urge you all do not use this company !
0	i would recommend ebay .
0	i know it '_s a pain but you will make 000x more money .
0	take my advice people , thanks :)
0	sign up process was super easy to follow .
0	got all my things in the cart and shipped out to my door is less_than 0 days !
0	= o i '_m shocked at how fast this transaction was .
0	and how low the prices are !
0	i can '_t believe this guys make money at all from selling so cheap !
0	kudos on the fast delivery .
0	nice job on the excellent service .
0	great team you '_ve got there .
0	authentic items , carefully_packed by a worker named frank .
0	thanks for the free toffee candy as well .
0	the customer service and quick_turnaround of product for towelsrus was superb .
0	i purchased excellent quality towels & bathrobes and have been very happy with them ever_since .
0	thank_you .
0	i have had two experiences with cjs_cd_keys and both_times i have been felt cheated one way or another .
0	first was with bf0 , ordered form them as their site said it was in stock , it was not .
0	a week_later i had not received my key so asked for a refund which was an uphill struggle in itself .
0	second was ordering a 00 day game time card for starcraft 0 , thought heck £ 0 . 00 for 00 day trial is decent i will go for that , ordered it and turns_out its 0 hours of game time in a 00 day period .
0	a small detail which is nowhere on the products page , unless you read the one review at the bottom which i noticed only after i went scouring the page to see if it said anything about this but it does not .
0	( except for the review )
0	so year , some may say its a harsh rating but not in my book .
0	had a great departure flight great holiday .
0	then the return flight set off 00_mins before departure with no name call outs and left me and my girlfriend stranded .
0	the manager didn_'_t care and had a really poor attitude .
0	apart_from this , jet0 . com was really good , but the return was awful , awful service !
0	not likely to use them again !
0	i was slightly_dubious as fonehub were offering by far the highest price for the phone , ( nearly_£_00 more ) which rang alarm_bells for me .
0	i read some reviews though , and they seemed fine .
0	so i sent the phone off , via special delivery , and requested the payment by cheque , rather_than bacs .
0	the phone was in brand_new condition ; i had won it in a competition earlier in the week .
0	fonehub emailed to say they had received the phone as soon as it arrived , and then sent a cheque out to me the next_day .
0	they paid the full_amount , as promised .
0	in summary ; by far the best price , and paid quickly .
0	great prices .
0	kept up to date with delivery times .
0	quick delivery .
0	perfect .
0	i would recommend to anyone .
0	nice easy to use website with a good product range .
0	the trainers i ordered came in just a couple of days .
0	will use again .
0	i '_ve been hosting my websites with tso for over 0 years_now and have never looked back after skipping around a load of other " cheap " hosts .
0	tso have managed to provide a £££ service for a £ price , not only that but their personal support is second to none and puts a lot of bigger / well_known hosts to shame .
0	when the company i work for ( a web development agency ) were looking to change hosts i didn_'_t hesitate to recommend tso - we '_ve now been using them for a year and haven_'_t had any_issues ( apart_from some network downtime , which affected everyone and wasn_'_t tsos fault )
0	i ordered a 00x00 photobook with super gloss_finish and lay - flat pages .
0	the software was a breeze to use and it took be about 00_hours to layout around 000 photos over 00 - odd pages including selecting the photos from my computer .
0	unlike most places you order from they keep you fully_informed whilst they are creating your book , with an order progress page showing you when its been printed , bound etc
0	my first book arrived and unfortunately the first few dozen pages had stuck together on the edge where it seems the glue used to stick the gloss on hadn_'_t quite dried when it packed up .
0	even with this defect i was simply stunned by the book - it was amazing !
0	the quality of the materials used , the colours in the photos was superb .
0	i contacted albelli customer_support about the sticking pages , they asked for a few pictures as evidence which i provided and they came back - no problem , we will re - print you a new one straight_away .
0	it arrived today without_any_problems and like the first it is simply_stunning quality .
0	i would definitely recommend albelli to friends .
0	we had a great choice of packages and , having picked one , the day went very smoothly .
0	we had a great time , and didn_'_t have any_problems with being a " big group of lads ", which i have experienced on other stags .
0	great experience , i '_ll certainly use them again .
0	i '_ve ordered from these_guys a few_times now , and each time they have been fantastic .
0	great selection of gear and great prices , and fast and efficent postage .
0	they often beat wiggle prices if not they at_least match wiggles prices , i would rather order from these_guys than wiggle , beacuse if anything were to go_wrong , at_least you can get in touch with probikekit ,
0	great website , great service ,
0	thank_you
0	great service , has a wide_range of lenses to choose from , very good prices and quick delivery .
0	a * service , thank_you
0	found tyre_shopper somehow on google , have usually used competitors of theirs .
0	however when they came up in the search_results , i found them very easy to use , all the infomation that is needed is displayed and are the best prices i have found , very easy payment and booking process .
0	and the tyre shop is more than happy to deal with you after .
0	great website .
0	thank_you
0	great service , great price , quick and efficent .
0	would reccomend .
0	thank_you
0	been ordering from this site for a few_years , never had an issue .
0	i '_ve ordered from cjs_cd_keys three_times now and each time has_been absolutely fantastic .
0	it '_s fast and the keys work flawlessly .
0	great prices and great service .
0	i brought a costume for a fancy_dress party and won best outfit .
0	but not only was the costume great but it arrived very quickly letting_me know where it was through text , without having to look or track my items down .
0	also all items are at affordable prices and have everything you need to stand out .
0	i would recommend this site to anyone without_any second_thoughts about it
0	joop homme is my favorite and the price on fragrancedirect is the cheapest i found online : d
0	this is my 0rd phone i '_ve sold to mazumamobile , for this time and given it was a bank_holiday when i submitted my request , anyway bag came wednesday phone returned same day , received email thursday advising payment auth ' d and payment was in my bank same day now thats service , you can '_t go_wrong dose what it says on the tin .
0	forget the great customer service , site usability and low_prices , my favourite thing about stand - out is the diversity of their range in modern styles , ranging_from high_street prices up to premium_brands .
0	just purchased a tweed_jacket and some brogues , great selection and price , no need to scour the net when it '_s all in one place .
0	easy to navigate site that gave_me a wide_choice of options , which obviously led to me picking the cheapest ( that is clean ) place that is available !
0	thanks hostelbookers . com !
0	friendly and well_mannered staff eager to get that claim completed !
0	fast shipping and awesome free_samples every time .
0	only place i shop for all my supplement_needs .
0	gr0 communication & fast payment .. easiest £_00 i '_ve made in my life !!!!
0	!
0	i have ordered many many items from amazon .
0	i am in the army and they offer some of the best support by companies for service people deployed on operations using bfpo_addresses .
0	every purchase has arrived on time and any drop in price in the short_term is refunded .
0	excellent !
0	the website was easy to use , the envelopes arrived on time and the money was transfered straight into my account .
0	easy , fast and reliable !
0	a lot of fun , and some good prizes on offer .
0	assuming my prizes come through i would recommend this site to anyone .
0	check it out .
0	very knowledgeable , polite and friendly staff .
0	as someone that is a novice to rc_cars i was treated well , and i am_delighted with service and product i have recently brought .
0	the staff listened to what i wanted and gave great advice and recommendations .
0	i would recommend modelsport without_hesitation .
0	i '_m so pleased with the way this company dealt_with me .
0	i made a few errors when i was ordering and they were most accommodating when i contacted them .
0	their delivery was on time and when projected .
0	i would be more than happy to use them again !
0	i would reccommend this company to you .
0	after perusing steve '_s website , i went on a date last night armed with what i had learned and had the most amazing first date ever , it was incredible .
0	i didn_'_t sleep with her but i kept in mind the things i ' d seen on steve '_s blogs and videos of him chasing girls .
0	specifically the way he didn_'_t try to do anything special but just stayed centered and did what he wanted .
0	as a result , i didn_'_t have an_ounce of anxiety ; my mouth wasn_'_t dry and my hands weren_'_t shaking .
0	at first , holding eye contact didn_'_t feel natural but after 0 minutes i thought ' f_*** it ' and would just look at her and enjoy looking at her .
0	there were no awkward silences .
0	one of us always thought of something to say and it was often her that did which suited me just fine .
0	we spoke for three hours before i had to leave ( for the last train of the night ) with both of us saying we wish i could have stayed longer .
0	i did say if i missed the train i would have to catch one in the morning and she said ( in a relaxed way ) that she wouldn_'_t have sex on the first date but i swear that wouldn_'_t have been true .
0	we got on so well ; when we left the pub , i kissed her , again and again .
0	it felt so natural , the way i always imagined a first kiss should feel .
0	she was so into it that my hands started to wander and i gave her bum a little squeeze .
0	if i had the opportunity to stay longer , i think she would have been too worked up by the end to say no .
0	i have , however , arranged a second date with her .
0	next time , i '_ll arrange it so no train timetable cuts our time short .
0	of course it helped that she was very attracted to me to begin with .
0	this wasn_'_t exactly a cold approach and she asked me out but in the past i would have still mucked it up by being too terrified to believe i was worthy of her .
0	i can see such simple value in what steve teaches .
0	i didn_'_t know it could be this easy or natural .
0	i especially loved part 0 of the first date article that said just ' treat her like your girlfriend .'
0	it '_s amazing how we only become open to ideas when someone_else says they can be true .
0	i ' d love to go see steve but can '_t afford it right now .
0	i believe he plans to publish a book , when he does i will_definitely buy it .
0	i can wholeheartedly_recommend steve '_s teachings .
0	very quick and professional service .
0	postage pack came straight_away .
0	money was received within 0 days , even faster_than_expected .
0	very effective and prompt communication via_email .
0	can 000_% recommend .
0	wickedly fast service .
0	digital content codes are recieved instantly and physical items are delivered rapidly .
0	no_hassle what so ever .
0	highly_recommended company
0	i '_m very happy .
0	post bag arrived after 0 days .
0	service was quick and efficient .
0	just wanted to drop a quick note to thank_you for the service and particularly for the sfe - 0000 frame , which i hope will be brought back into stock even if at a higher price .
0	it isn_'_t always easy to find frames with such a small depth ( which i '_ve found suits my prescription ) or retailers that bother to list this as a measurement .
0	i booked through lastminute for a single nights stay with no breakfast for my partners 00st in a secret london hotel .
0	i found out the next_day that the hotel would have been cheaper had it been booked through the hotels website and would have included breakfast in the price !
0	i rang lastminute and they stated they would not offer a price match past 00_hours of booking !
0	( it was less_than 00_hours that i rang )
0	after numerous e_- mails back and forth to different managers and supervisors i came to no resolution .
0	however the hotel staff made every effort upon our arrival to correct this error .
0	last_minute offered no such resolution !
0	i will not be booking with them again !
0	i have only ordered twice from these_guys and i have to say they have been great .
0	had to call once to chase up an order which was my fault i have to say not theirs and they .
0	even refunded the delivery costs !
0	lovely guys and i wish them all the best .
0	0 thing i will say but they still get 0_stars is they have quite a low stock of things which is a shame as few things i wanted was not available .
0	recommend these 0000 %

0	i placed an order on - line and got it delivered in two_days . i choose 0 - 0 days shipping from there website . they emailed when they shipped the order .. i never had a need to phone them so cant say how good they are on the phone .
0	poor reception , avoid !
0	a good company !
0	i '_ll never use them again !
0	such a bad company !
0	i have used them for many many_years !
0	just brilliant , highly_recommend
0	they are disgraceful to sellers !
0	support fraudulent_activity !
0	great web_designers !
0	do really good job !
0	you won_'_t believe_how bat their commercial support is !
0	and you just cannot avoid it sometimes , as they own the lines !
0	:(

0	tesco is crap !
0	i '_ve bought a storage compartment another day .
0	highly_recommend
0	i do not like monopolies !
0	i just like ba , used it a lot ove the years
0	i ordered flowers for international delivery almost a week before the delivery date .
0	they failed to arrive on time .
0	when i contacted online help all i got told was " well , we '_ve put the order through to the local_florist " and " perhaps if you leave it a couple more hours " the last one was at 0pm local time !
0	i waiting feed_back ...
0	i '_ve had great service now , for over 00 parcels .
0	nothing has_gone_wrong , and now 0 of them have arrived the day after sending .
0	one even on a saturday .
0	to get that sort of service i would have had to pay just under £_00 from another courier .
0	it '_s a nice easy way to send a parcel , especially without the hassle of the long_queue at the post_office .
0	excellent service and super_fast delivery
0	i used to use inkshop printing for my leaflets , but upon the referral of a friend i tried printing . com .
0	johnny and the boys done a top job .
0	an all_round better product .
0	i first started_using knox at the beginning of last season and now i ' d never look back !
0	the design of all products are ao highly developed that it allows me to focus on my riding - ( the important bit ) and feel_confident and comfortable with the safety gear im using !
0	would highly_recommend to anyone .
0	i have been on many sites for supplements , but i have used bodybuilding_warehouse for a while .
0	an this is now the only website i do use to get my supplements from .
0	there is honestly nothing bad to say about bodybuilding_warehouse , they make customer service come first .
0	i would highly_recommend this to everyone who is in the training or gym environment .
0	they get a 00 / 00 from me .
0	i was very pleased with the service i received from servicing_stop again .
0	collection and delivery were punctual and cheerfully carried_out ; contact with the personnel carrying out the service was helpful and informative and the costs were all very reasonable .
0	will be back next year !
0	once again i been left_feeling extremely happy with the service i received .
0	i found exactly_what i was looking for with other alternatives available too .
0	delivery was swift and fast .
0	very pleased with service and items received
0	bad customer service .
0	they sent the wrong coloured item that i ordered .
0	instead of e_- mailing me and asking me if a different_colour would be o . k they just sent me it .
0	they will not answer my e_- mails , i have sent 0 to them .
0	i would consider defiantly not using them .
0	equipyourtrip . com if your reading this i '_m order number [ removed_] and a very unhappy customer .
0	i ordered sim_city and after ordering was told the 0th then the 0th .
0	i have contacted cj keys so many_times regarding this and all i get is the same auto response .
0	i have seen other people paying extra for the key ( game gone up to £_00 . 00 ) and people are getting instant delivery however if you order the game before you do not get it .
0	do not use these for keys if you ask for a refund they will not give it you and when you order a game if someone pays more they get the keys .
0	discovered the website completely by surprise and so glad i did .
0	so_far , i '_ve bought 0 games and all codes arrived with minutes and all worked_fine .
0	excellent polite service , very helpful and met all my needs .
0	product was as_described .
0	will_def_use service again for my companies 00 year anniversary .
0	they pay more than anyone_else and payment is fast
0	very good service fast deliver and friendly drivers :) number 0
0	orders come through quickly and are priced exceptionally well compared to peers .
0	will happily do_business with again .
0	huge choice for great price ...... always use them ...
0	i have ordered many_times from bbw and have always found the service very reliable .
0	i have also asked questions before via social_media and they are prompt to answer .
0	overall i rate them highly and have stopped using my previous_supplier
0	the guitar i ordered was dispached and delivered very quickly , it was an effortless experience .
0	this is what internet_shopping it meant to be about !
0	i '_ve had cd_keys from these_guys twice_now , and both_times the experience has_been quick and painless .
0	they are by far the cheapest on the market when it comes to standalone keys , their checkout and authentication process is fast , effective , and makes you feel secure in your purchase .
0	they may look slightly sketchy to most , but i believe this to be a case of ' if it '_s too good to be true , it likely isn_'_t '.
0	these_guys are the exception to that rule .
0	i will_definitely be using them again .
0	hello , its ambar price .
0	imperial_visa is fantastic needed a indefinite leave visa for my wife tried the border agency website there was no appointments at all !
0	tried other_firms but choose imperial_visa and turned_out fantastic they treated us well and also done all the job for us with no_hassle or problems at all .
0	i strongly_recommend using them as i will be using them again in a year ;-)
0	the prices are the cheapest i can find .
0	the only_downfall is the shipping price is high .
0	it cuts most of the savings on the items themselves but still saved some money .
0	i would only wish for a constant shipping cost instead of variable cost .
0	my service didn_'_t come on the dates it was due , i decided to get onto the team at parcel0go and spoke to an extremely_helpful member of the team ' ashley ' in about 0 minutes my service was rebooked free of charge quickly and easily .
0	im extremely happy with this service and ill continue to use over and over , also thank_you ashley , fantastic member of the team .
0	0 *!!
0	!
0	with this site , it was extremely easy to find exactly_what i was looking for .
0	always the best price and accommodations .
0	the booking process is very transparent and straight through .
0	congratulations .
0	i recommend .
0	overall good but wasn_'_t very happy about the part getting phone there by a certain time as it may reduce the amount .
0	but part from that it been a ok experience
0	really chuffed to pieces with the speed and efficiency of the service provided by urban_industry .
0	the clothes are awesome too , just an all_round happy customer .
0	big up my yard clothing too , just purchased a tee and i '_m well happy with it !
0	took my car for a simple oil_change ( i think even my 0 years old daughter could have done it better_than their " engineer ") and the next_day when i was in the inside lane on the motorway the oil_filter what was not installed properly got untighten and just let all the oil splashed on the road and my engine got seized .
0	it all happened within few_seconds so i had to react quickly and try to pull over into the hard shoulder while i put my and my passengers life in danger .
0	i have managed to pull over and i immediately called them where they were happy to do an inspection straight_away .
0	at the garage they admitted they made an error and their organized a hire car .
0	at this point i was still happy even i knew i will never see my car again because they handled my problem quickly they understood me and they tried to help .
0	but than the nightmare started , they forwarded my case to their insurance company .
0	their insurance company never called me proactively , i was the one who was chasing them all the time .
0	first they said they will fix my car , than they said they can not , than they said again they will fix it .
0	it took a month when i got a final_decision that they will do a write off and they will offer some money .
0	they came up first with a ridiculous value what i refused , than they came up with a value what was more realistic compared to the market value however i have highlighted them my concern that i had other expenses as well on the damaged car ( tires only bought in december , still got tax on it , had a full_tank of petrol , etc_.)
0	but i was told they will only give money for the value of the car and the money will not cover anything_else so i have to investigate this further with national_tyres .
0	fair_enough i said , why would they pay for it so i emailed national `_s head_office where i managed to meet with the worst customer service experience i have ever had .
0	i have rang them at_least 00 times , emailed them at_least 0 times but they never came back to me with a straight answer .
0	i think they have hired a parrot who can only repeat a very standard response : it is with the regional_manager .
0	now they want the hire car back even we are not sorted and they recon i will not get an compensation because the insurance company paid for all of my expenses what is a lie because i have recorded phone_call where they clearly_state , they will not pay other expenses .
0	i am really not expecting too much money and this is not the way how i want to be rich but i think i have the right expecting compensation after they just killed my beloved car .
0	i am shocked that a company offering such poor service can still be trading .
0	when i first bought the camera from valuebasket , i did so from a company that at_least appeared legitimate ; a smart website and reasonable prices .
0	my first phone_call to the company , having realised my order was taking a while longer_than it probably should , left me feeling reassured rather_than concerned ; my order was apparently upgraded to ' priority ' which , having read all the forums on valuebasket , appears to be the case with everyone ; as it says in disney '_s the incredibles ' if everyone is special , no one is '.
0	i quickly realised all my calls and emails , each answered with a few copy and paste paragraphs from ' how to be good at customer service ', were not helping and , when not of my questions could be answered , i gave up .
0	they could not say when my camera was likely to arrive or tell the cause of the delay .
0	i cancelled my order .
0	then the problems have really started .
0	despite emailing and calling every day , i have been told - by different agents - that my refund will take 0 / 0 / 0 days to be ' initiated '.
0	i understand that the process to send the money back may take some time when their company is in hong_kong , but pressed them as to why it would take that long to press a button to ' initiate ' it .
0	again , all replies read ' we are very sorry for you inconvenience we understand times like this can be frustrating etc_etc_etc '.
0	all i want is my money to be returned but there is still no sign .
0	fortunately , rbs will be assisting because of the dispute and hopefully it can then be resolved .
0	i was really pleased with the purchase and particularly with the customer service i received .
0	as usual a straight_forward service from print what team and our key account_manager miia .
0	we ordered 0000 compliment_slips
0	required urgently for our client , after_placing the order our artwork was checked and the process from checkout to delivery was
0	seamless , the product arrived on time with no errors .
0	we have noticed a number of improvements to the way that print what are
0	operating and many of the tedious delivery delays that occurred last_year have been sorted , plus we now have a dedicated account
0	manager as a key customer .
0	also the new way they package printing into bundles with bank note style bands is great for ensuring the
0	product doesn_'_t get damaged in transit and makes it easier to store !
0	great job .
0	i have just leased my third car through nvc .
0	the first two personal leases and the latest one though my business .
0	as usual i am staggered at how ridiculously straight_forward and efficient the process is .
0	you find the car you want ( they will sometime match if you find cheaper ), they send you a quote , you click on a link and complete the simple form , they take £_000 processing fee , do a credit check and within a week send you all your paperwork by email along with very clear_instructions , delivery date etc .
0	couldn_'_t be easier !
0	when it comes to delivery the cars are sourced from main_dealers around the country and delivered by a member of staff from that dealership - the handover is done at your home or office ( i always drop them back to the station to say thanks ), and that '_s it the car is yours to enjoy - until the renewal .
0	highly highly_recommended nvc and cass tann who is very helpful and always available to talk .
0	well_done .
0	i '_ve been using their ebay store to buy guitar_strings for a while now and cannot_fault them .
0	items are delivered quickly .
0	never had a problem when contacting the staff with any questions , they always get back to you quickly and seem happy to help .
0	i called for my toner later on in the day and the representative was really helpful as out toner was really low .
0	it was guaranteed still for next_day and was there first thing in the morning .
0	as from now i have an email address to use so the toners from now on can be ordered from there which is far more efficient for me .
0	all in all a great service and the toner is fine and there were no probems with the product at all .
0	this site is incredibly easy to navigate and the deals make it so cheap !
0	the price adjusting makes sure you get the cheapest prices for sure .
0	worth it and recommendable !
0	the high shipping cost is definitely worth it with all the free bonuses they offer with they ' re already extremely competitive_prices .
0	i '_ve started_using this website around a year_ago and now get all my supplements from supplementwarehouse . com .
0	although i don_'_t get to utilize it as much as i ' d like ; i still enjoy their deals .
0	its so easy to get the best price with the price beater option .
0	just put in competitors price and web url and bam , better price :) i love this
0	prices are being constantly raised for a constantly diminishing service .
0	this seems to be their business goal at the moment , put prices as high as we can , while lowering service as much as we can .
0	it '_s all about margins with these_people .
0	they aren_'_t going to be around in 00 years unless they change drastically .
0	i know so many people moving away .
0	i once went 0_weeks without internet access because a mast was down in my city_centre , i was told to just " wait it out " over the phone by customer_services .
0	very fast delivery , great price .
0	will use again .
0	basically the place we rent from gave edf the wrong meter serial and reading when we moved in , so when it came time to enter our real readings the system was like ' we can '_t let you do that dave '.
0	easy fix , i '_ll just phone edf let them know the issue get it resolved in a matter of seconds , afterall it '_s what a couple of strings / integers in a database right ?
0	oh how i was so so wrong .
0	five months down the line , contacted numerous complaints departments , have a phone bill of £_00 from contacting them altogether over the months , sent numerous_emails and website contact forms .
0	nothing resolved , every time it '_s " we ' re looking into this ".
0	sure you are .
0	in the meantime i can '_t submit readings so i '_m being charged over the odds for gas !
0	which is likely why they aren_'_t bothered , after all their making decent money from me .
0	nothing but a massive scam and i wont ever use them again for the rest of my life .
0	wouldn_'_t recommend these to an enemy never mind a friend .
0	a shame you can '_t rate lower_than one star , doesn_'_t even deserve that .
0	after having some problems getting my mattress supplied and delivered i was left without the one i wanted particularly due to supply issues , the director has since phoned and apologised personally about this .
0	it was obvious he cared a great deal about customer_satisfaction and his companies reputation ( which is a rare_thing these days ).
0	he '_s now arranged for me to get the mattress i was originally after ( with no extra_charge ), as well as keeping the old one so i couldn_'_t be_happier .
0	after being reassured my issues were a one off , and that they take customer_satisfaction seriously , i genuinely believe them as they didn_'_t have to call me to sort anything out , that was their decision .
0	would order from here in future my faith in them has_been restored as a customer .
0	to sum_up i '_ve come away quite happy and reassured that there are companies out there that still care about their reputations and customers !
0	was extremely impressed with the promotional discounts .
0	i would recommend this site to anyone , it has no server issues and is very easy to use
0	i recieved the serial in seconds , and there was no fussing_around !
0	0 / 0 !
0	i took my fender jaguar in for a set_up and it came back in perfect working order with no_problems , until after a couple of times of playing it i realised something was wrong and the guitar was unplayable .
0	i took it back to the shop and they spotted the problem straight_away and sorted it out for free - turns_out the bridge had fallen down and they soon corrected it by raising it back up again and gave_me a free allen_key so i could do it myself if it ever happened again .
0	all the staff are friendly and very helpful and i ' d recommend them to anyone .
0	emailed you back because your product did not work .
0	advised i would send you faulty goods back and requested them to be replaced .
0	sent goods .
0	nothing .
0	nada .
0	emailed you to ask what was happening .
0	no response .
0	nothing at all .
0	you have debited my card for my money and i have nothing to show for it .
0	your company is an_absolute_disgrace and i shall be sharing this on facebook and asking it to be shared if i do not get some recompense .
0	very very disappointed and out of pocket
0	badly treated customer
0	the service arbico offered me was excellent and very professional , from my first queries right up until now .
0	i was informed every other day with information about the status of the delivery , and any useful updates were recommended to me .
0	the pc arrived on the day specified on day 0 , and was packaged securely .
0	the actual pc was excellent value for money and i love it , any minor technical_queries i did have were answered_promptly and concisely , and they were quickly resolved .
0	excellent service , i would recommend them to anyone looking to buy a pc .
0	a satisfied customer .
0	a sales_guy at a nutrition and wellness store actually recommended that i check out supplementwarehouse . com to find good quality protein_powder for very cheap .
0	he said that he doesn_'_t buy any protein from his store but rather from this website .
0	i was also able to find another product that he recommended to me on this website .
0	supplementwarehouse . com price matched that item for me and actually lowered the price a little_bit from a competitor '_s website .
0	i think that was a very good example of the great customer service i received and i was able to buy both of the items for cheaper_than just the protein_powder in the store .
0	very cool !
0	i had a list of products to order and founf them easily and processed an order .
0	delivery was as stated on the site with the brushes well_packed .
0	envelope sent out quickly with easy to follow_instructions .
0	even when my phone was delayed on the way back to them as a result if the snow they emailed me to say they would honour the full_amount even if it arrived there after the expiry_date .
0	would definitely recommend to others .
0	quality product , fast service , unfortunately too potent for my liking d - aa gave_me a panic attack .
0	ive been dissappointed with play recently , these_guys did it cheaper , faster and the product was working as it should .
0	my friends game was from play , arrived late and when he tried to play the disk it failed , so a return on the cards !
0	ok , ea '_s fault but just added to the misery .
0	mine arrived on release day and worked great .
0	will use again int_he future
0	the price matching makes it one of the best .
0	it has easy navigation throughout the website and makes me want to buy more supplements because of the great deals !
0	first time customer here ... will_definitely be back !
0	way cheaper_than any store you can drive to and they have everything you need .
0	great descriptions of all of their products and it all makes_sense even for someone just starting out in the world of supplements .
0	thanks for a good experience ..... you have a new customer !
0	placed an order for some hardware on a wednesday and i was gigging with it on a friday .
0	great service .
0	very quick despatch / delivery and good prices !
0	the service that they provided was excellent , ewan was so helpful and easy to deal with i will_definatly be booking with them again .
0	i work full time and do not have time to look for movers , as well as pay the prices for some of them .
0	shiply was easy convenient and i have already_recommended it to all of my friends that are moving .
0	i typed in my phones model number , it gave_me a price and instructions how to complete .
0	within 0 days i had the cash in my bank !
0	parcels are hardly_ever collected when they should be .
0	way too often i get replies saying ' we apologise for the inconvenience ' with no explanation whatsoever .
0	and then to be informed that the parcel will be collected not the following_day , but up to 0 days_later ?!
0	shocking customer service .
0	probably one of the worst companies i '_ve ever_dealt_with in my life .
0	brilliant information .
0	sensational .
0	use it everyday !
0	didn_'_t think to inform_me once when my bill hit an unusually high amount !
0	a courtesy text would have been nice .
0	orange , you are the worst mobile operator in existence .
0	bought a laptop off them .
0	£ 0000 .... money most definately not well spent .
0	professional con - men run this company , and if you believe otherwise , you ' re most definately a conman .
0	legends .
0	full stop
0	used them once and low and behold , the courier driver didn_'_t even turn_up for his collection !
0	nor did the company call to let_me know the driver wasn_'_t going to be able to collect !
0	had to contact them myself and they told me due to ' operational reasons ', the parcel would be collected the following_day !
0	was told i will be contacted in the following few_days for a slight discount but its been 0_weeks and have heard_nothing !
0	worst courier company in the world !
0	please make the world happy and go_bankrupt !
0	kind_regards ...
0	how can a bad review possibly be left for this company ?
0	carry on doing what your doing !
0	wish i invented the site !
0	:)
0	flew with ryannair for the first time in my life and actually can '_t report back with any_problems ?!
0	can '_t say i '_ll choose them again !
0	ha !
0	quick and hassle_free .
0	never have had a problem with them .
0	great for everything !
0	pre_- ordered the new dewalt kit ( not realising it was a pre_- order ) phoned ffx , who were very polite and helpful in explaining things to me .
0	product was delivered on the day that they told me and within the one hour_window .
0	i am absolutely_thrilled with their service , communication and products and would have no_hesitation in using / recommending them in the future .
0	in this day and age it is hard to find a company that ticks_all the boxes , but my word - ffx do !
0	i was sceptical_about phone_recycling_companies but this was really hassle_free .
0	completed the form online - pouch received in 00hrs - posted back same day - money in my account the next_day .
0	this was the easiest transaction i have every completed .
0	i am must_say that the protein_powder i bought here iss easily one of if not the best i have used .
0	it mixes almost_instantly and tastes fantastic ( cherry_bakewell ) i will be happy to recommend and will_definitely use this company again and again .
0	o and excellent prices to
0	excellent range of stock , gr0 prices and loads of good offers .
0	have used a few_times and will keep in using .

0	i have been with 000 reg for about 0 years_now .
0	throughout this time i have had no downtime that i know of or any customer has informed me of .
0	i had to call customer service once since i have been with them and whilst i cannot_speak for others it was a pleasure .
0	i now have 0 domains registered with them and looking to add more .
0	000gifts . co . uk and pure000 . co .
0	i would not look anywhere_else for my domain_names .
0	i cannot be_happier with this company .
0	i moved here from another_provider some time ago and to be honest i cannot_fault the staff or the product .
0	first things first , if you have a problem a phone_call will resolve it .
0	i have not had an issue yet that was not resolved in a 0 minute phone_call .
0	( most of these problems were me not reading the help files properly ) then there are always answers on the forum as well .
0	the software works_perfectly straight_away and keeps on working .
0	it all works exactly as it says on the website .
0	they are more than happy to allow third_party companies to work on your sites for you .
0	you will not be sorry choosing this company
0	to be honest i cannot rate them high enough .
0	00 / 00
0	i used ekm powershop for about 0 months and have to say in my entire time with ekm i was insulted by the staff .
0	frequently lied to over problems with my website .
0	they would tell me the problem was only on my computer yet i would have customers ringing me up .
0	you cannot access their forum until you join .
0	the reason for this is because you will see a lot of dusgruntled customers on there .
0	not all as most have been banned from the forum because ekm dont want to deal with them .
0	beware of what you read .
0	i would check out some online retail forums or online business forums and find the general view on ekm before you ever sign up .
0	on the whole i would not even send my worst_enemy to ekm at all .
0	don_'_t even get me started on the fact that nothing actually works as it should on there .
0	mike was absolutely cracking .
0	arrived promptly and did the job carefully and smoothly .
0	i was enthusiastic about hearing about brakes on the drive , considering mine will need replacing in the near_future .
0	great customer service , would recommend mike to anyone
0	thanks for the brilliant service
0	it gave_me my unlock_code immediately , and i am now using my htc one s on any network i fancy !

0	highly_recommended , try now !
0	cannot recommend these_guys enough .
0	i bought a very expensive guitar from them , and some other equipment , and they were really friendly and helpful the whole way through .
0	i finally ordered the guitar and it was delivered on time the next_day .
0	couldn_'_t be_happier !
0	now that i '_ve bought something big from them , they '_ve upgraded my account to vip , which means i get a discount applied to everything .
0	never_experienced customer treatment like this in my life !
0	so stoked .
0	buy from these_people .
0	i '_ve bought quite a few things from guitarguitar - mostly guitar accessories and the like .
0	whenever i '_ve had a question or , when i once had to return something , they were always a huge pleasure to deal with .
0	when i was considering buying a guitar from them , they were extremely_helpful , didn_'_t pressure me for a second to make a sale , and gave_me honest and impartial_advice .
0	i eventually bought a different guitar , but if guitarguitar had had it in stock at the time i would have bought it from them , even if it had been a bit more_expensive , just cos they '_ve been so cool every time i '_ve ever had dealings with them .
0	definitely the first place i look if i want to buy anything for my guitars .
0	or maybe add to my collection ...
0	bluepark is a superb system and the support provided by the entire bluepark team is exceptional .
0	the system has an_abundance of useful features and tools .
0	i have been with bluepark for over four years_now and i would highly_recommend this stable and well supported platform to anyone .
0	a stumbled_across this company and couldn_'_t be more thankful .
0	what a brilliant company with a even better service .
0	keep_up the good work and i will be sure to recommend you to my fellow gamers !.
0	after taking £_00 from my account without purchase , i decided to call paypal .
0	biggest mistake of my life .
0	their call_centre was operated by constant questions from a machine .
0	at the end of the day , my problem was not solved .
0	had to pay £_00 for a service that did not solve my problem , even more than the amount that was taken out of my account .
0	this is a scam .
0	avoid calling them at all cost , literally ..
0	i must_admit , this was the first time something of such had happened in my years of using the service .
0	nevertheless , their call_centre is a massive con
0	i really appreciate the service from this site .
0	my pc is fantastic and was well_worth the price .
0	also i '_m happy to say it arrived fairly quickly .
0	i look_forward to future_purchases here .
0	i always appreciate the low_prices and great deals i find on amazon
0	this company is great , it has everything that a professional or amateur bodybuilder or workout enthusiast could ever need !
0	the service is excellent and the website is easy to maneuver through and find just the right product you are looking for !
0	two thumbs_up from this guy !!
0	!
0	honestly , when it comes to fitness , supplementwarehouse carries more than even amazon .
0	i use amazon for a ton of stuff in every_aspect of my life , but that giant retailer still could not compete with supplement_warehouse '_s supply and prices .
0	to be honest , i know there are some reviews floating_around the internet about the security of the site .
0	that is old news .
0	supplementwarehouse never wanted that stuff to happen , and when the site was breached , they upped their security , and it '_s top_notch now .
0	with those issues out of the way , it '_s definitely the place to go for your supplement_needs .
0	good service , quick dispatch of tickets , would recommend
0	i ordered flowers for my gf and have countless_times tried to contact iflorist to find out information_regarding its delivery time , and to track it a service i paid extra for !
0	i have not received any reply apart_from a pathetic automated_response and there online_chat doesn_'_t work .
0	there is no way of calling them as there is no phone number , if the flowers do not get delivered today i will be furious !
0	communication is disgraceful !
0	i was kept up to date on the status of the order , and item arrived only a couple of days after it got back in stock .
0	the website is well_designed , there is a universe of supplements to choose from , but all the info you ' re looking for is available .
0	shipping is fast and secure , never had any_issues , and am definitiely glad to be a repeat buyer .
0	i bought an_epiphone bass , my first bass actually , its just awesome , it play '_s like a beast , sounds_like a beast , the tone and sound that comes from it is just awesome !
0	its a good thing i bought it , its a good price and great guitar , having lots of fun with it , and especially when i crank the distortion up to extreme metal , its just insane , the sound is just pure metal with a sprincle of head bangers !

0	they matched prices from other_websites that had slightly_cheaper pricing on two products .
0	they gave a 0 % lower price when matching !

0	brilliant service , delivered on the day advised and very very competitive_prices i will be using dolphin_fitness again and again !
0	i ordered off myprotein after_reviewing the ingredients and comparing them to many top_brands and they seem to be more or less the same .
0	lots of people moan_about taste but i dont use supplements as a treat i use them to achieve my goals alongside training hard .
0	but in all honesty it doesnt taste any worse then any other shake i have tried .
0	i will be switching over permantley to using myprotein from now on !
0	excellent range of products , far better_than available in high_street chains .
0	staff were incredibly attentive and helpful , all in all a very enjoyable_experience .
0	i have been a regular_user of chemical for almost a year and a half now .
0	i primarily buy my vinyl_records here but also have done some clothes shopping .
0	service is great for both .
0	vinyl is always very well_packaged and ships fairly fast .
0	i '_ve never had a warped or broke vinyl yet !
0	the clothes are always well_packed too but they usually come with records anyways !
0	can '_t comment on their customer_support as i '_ve never had to use it .
0	:) will_continue using chemical in the future .
0	great prices , free mechandise , and fast shipping
0	fast and brilliant service highly_recommend

0	delivery was prompt , over all a great service and great experience .
0	they match all prices , fast shipping , and website was a breeze to use .
0	i switched over from bodybuilding . com and i am not going back
0	convenient and cheaper_than anyone_else .
0	brandsumo have literally from the ground up built us a ecommerce_platform that can not only deal with sales in a efficient well thought out way , but can also handle our finance_options we offer to our customers .
0	every_aspect of the website does_exactly_what we need it to do .
0	on top of the great look and feel of the website they have built us and the second to none functionality allowing us to do exactly_what we need on a daily_basis with ease - the customer focus is 000_%.
0	whatever we have needed to be customised , edited , or re - build brandsumo have done for us no questions_asked .
0	the prices are great and these_guys are well_worth the money - the work_ethic these_guys have is exactly_what you need when running a business and exactly_what we look for when hiring professionals to do a job .
0	fantastic work !
0	well first time with bairstow eves and will be the last time also .
0	the contractors they use are useless , their attitudes are - it '_s always someone_else '_s fault .
0	you need to speak to this person that person .
0	no sense of responsibility nor customer_satisfaction .
0	took them weeks to even return a phone_call .
0	took them months to get things fixed with the house when requested .
0	really bad , liers and con_artists .
0	if you want half a job or the job to never be finished then look no further .
0	if you want to wait months for them to even contact you , then lie that they have the wrong number , then lie that they have contacted your partner , then lie some more - then use trent maintenance .
0	useless !
0	at first it seems like a great offer , cash_back for something you would perhaps buy anyway .
0	however , do not be_fooled_by the high cash_back amounts - if you are willing to wait up to a year for cash_back , then it to come_back lower_than stated , then it to take another 0 months , constant emails back and forth , messages , getting annoyed and posting on the facebook fan page , being told to be patient again .
0	it '_s a shame this could be a really good site and a really good business but they are either useless themselves or the companies affiliate team they use are useless .
0	how can it take over 0 months for them to just look at the fact that someone has purchased a product with the same name , address , date of birth etc_etc ??!
0	!
0	very impressed with smart play zone and smart way imports .
0	they provide a top quality service and hassle_free returns .
0	even more_importantly their customer service is second to none .
0	never had a problem with these_guys and i have purchased from them a number of times for our business .
0	really really bad .
0	ordered a bed which came faulty .
0	sent the pictures and was agreed that it was a manufacturing_fault and that the item needed to be returned .
0	charged us £_00 for collection , didn_'_t inform us how the bed needed to be packaged so when the bed wasn_'_t taken charged another £_00 on top .
0	really bad customer service and poor quality items !!!
0	avoid at all costs .
0	they also operate under the trade name crazypricebeds .
0	really really bad .
0	ordered a bed which came faulty .

0	avoid at all costs .
0	used them twice .
0	once they delivered on the wrong day .
0	0nd time they didnt even collect the item after i waited in all day .
0	please do not use this company and amazon get_rid of them , they are useless .
0	yes i would like to inform yodel of my review .
0	so yodel ........ you can not run a business this way .
0	0000 + reviews and you have 0_star out of 00 .
0	does that not say anything ?
0	you will need a miracle to save your reputation and a miracle to keep any big contracts you have with amazon , boots etc .
0	after thousands of complaints do you not think it is time to sort your company out once and for all .
0	i feel sorry for any shareholder , customer or anyone who has the bad_luck of dealing_with you guys .
0	also put a customer service number on your website , and employ some decent staff !
0	using the online customer service was far_greater than i expected , katie was really helpful and quick to respond .
0	great friendly service :-)
0	[_name_] from parcel to go did an amazing job fixing a problem i had .
0	she should win a prize !
0	i contacted parcel0go with some concerns and got a very friendly operator called emma who answered all my questions straight_away in a clear and understandable manner resolving all my concerns straight_away if only all people could be this helpful .
0	thanks
0	i '_ve ordered from modelbits twice_now and both_times i received the orders within 00_hours ( perfect when you ' re missing those last few bits to complete a conversion ).
0	i '_ve generally found the prices of bits to be very competitive when compared to other bits sites , and the site is easy to navigate .
0	my one criticism is with the range of bits available at present , a little limited compared to the more established sites .
0	modelbits will_definetly be my first choice for bits from now on .
0	supplementwarehouse . com is the best place to buy supplements bar_none !
0	i don_'_t shop anywhere_else for my supplements .
0	if you are serious about your health and wellness and are looking for the highest_quality products for the lowest_prices , then go to supplementwarehouse . com !
0	they '_ll even hook you up with free stuff and tons of other great deals with your purchase !
0	supplementwarehouse . com is truly_amazing !
0	i would recommend supplementwarehouse . com to anyone and everyone !
0	i can '_t tell you how many_times i '_ve recommended supplement_warehouse to my friends , family and just people that come to me about vitamin / supplement advice .
0	they already have the lowest_prices , but in the chance you do find a lower price , they will match plus take 0 %_off !
0	that '_s the best deal on the internet !
0	plus the biggest selection you can think of , what more could you ask ?
0	oh_yeah , the thrill of checking out and getting even more free_samples , shirts , shakers , and tons more !
0	i get so excited ordering my new monthly supplements , almost more than using them to work out them self !
0	i appreciate all the hard work and the great service !
0	- justin w
0	ordered heating mats from them at a very reasonable price , they arrived within 0 days even to what some companies class as " scottish_highlands postcode ".
0	product was well_packaged along with very clear_instructions on installation and all extras to aid installation ( floor primer etc ) which are extras from some other_companies .
0	on installation , i had one query to whether or not the temperature sensor cables were polar biased in the controller so called the freephone_number online and was immediately put through to someone_who was friendly and helpful and clearly knew a lot about the product he was selling .
0	i would happily use this company again and could not recommend them enough to anyone .
0	i spoke to sammie_taylor she helped_me out with an account credit that i did wrong ( my mistake ) she was really friendly and helped_me out by doing all the things i asked and everything she could do to help , thanks :)
0	pharmacy0u is the easiest and quickest site for ordering your healthcare needs .
0	the service is quick and you often receive helpful product suggestions via_email .
0	to top it off , the prices are low !
0	fantastic service pick your shades go to checkout pay the next_day they arrive and got a right bargin to !
0	looks_like i had a brucey bonus !
0	i ordered some stuff a while ago it took nearly 00 days to arrive and needed the stuff for a gig so put me in a compromising position !
0	i would use again if delivery times improved
0	i have only one experience with g0m , and it has_been a complete nightmare .
0	i ordered the ‘ focal cms 00 active studio monitor_speakers ( pair ) with free stands ’ bundle on sunday 0th_december with delivery expected on the 00th_december .
0	on the monday and tuesday i had automated emails_telling_me my order was delayed and then the delivery was being brought forward , and then delayed again ...
0	on the thursday , i called g0m at which point i was told definitively that my order would be with me the following_day .
0	later that night ...
0	i receive an email_saying my order was delayed .
0	friday_morning i call up and speak to [_name_] who tells_me that in fact , i should have been contacted to be asked whether an ex - display speaker in the bundle would have been ok and that they could discount £_00 .
0	to me this wasn_’_t really acceptable and for the sake of £_00 wanted a brand_new speaker .
0	i asked to cancel the order , at which point i was put on hold for several minutes and then told they did in fact have 0 brand_new speakers they could send me .
0	i said this was fine and decided to proceed with the order as long as they would be delivered by the following_monday .
0	after spending £ 0 in phone_calls i might_add ...
0	00_minutes after this call , i receive an email from [_name_] telling_me there had been a mistake and that they couldn ’_t send me 0 brand_new speakers .
0	so i replied and requested my order be cancelled and my money refunded .
0	i then received a fairly prompt reply confirming my order cancellation and refund .
0	later that night , i receive an email_saying my order had been dispatched , i emailed [_name_] saturday_morning for confirmation this was not the case , to which he replied - confirming this was not the case .
0	monday_evening ...
0	i receive my cancelled order .
0	i check in the outer_packaging and one of the speakers is clearly the ex - display one .
0	i send an email to michael saying if they discount £_000 i ’ d consider keeping it , otherwise could he please arrange_collection of these erroneously delivered items .
0	collection has_been organised , but they cannot guarantee a time , and are holding on to my money until the items are back in their possession .
0	i would not have a problem with this if i was returning some goods etc , but i received these because of a fault on g0m ’_s part – whether it ’_s their automated_system , or a deliberate_attempt to get me to accept ex - display goods .
0	i don_’_t usually_write_reviews for anything , but this whole_experience has_been calamitous and is extremely annoying as i cannot order the speakers i want from a more reliable supplier until i get my money back .
0	i will say there customer service is prompt , but not really all that helpful .
0	won_’_t be using g0m ever again .
0	i was able to find what i was looking for and thanks to your lowest_price guarantee i was able to come away with an even better price than listed .
0	booked up very quickly through the internet with plenty if info .

0	have used the likes of dell before and decided it was time for an upgrade .
0	was pleased with the amount of options offered by the website only_downside is it can be a little_daunting knowing where to start .
0	initially was told it would take 0 working_days to build but in the end took 00 though i had expected this as had put a fair bit of money into it .
0	if anything would rather them take there time than rush through and miss potential errors .
0	when the product came to be delivered there was some_confusion with the couriers but the blame was in there court .
0	alan from cyberpower still managed to get me my pc on the same day .
0	have had the system for a week now and am very impressed with the build quality and chews through anything i throw at it .
0	overall the experience was good and hoping that technical_support will be good if i ever have to use them .
0	out of all the custom_build sites this will be the one i stick with .
0	i booked last_minute and had no issues .
0	amazing website .
0	aaron mclean
0	item arrived on time and was signed for recorded , also i called to ask whether or not they had stock of my item and the guy when and checked manually and said yes .. so overall great service
0	i just spent two_days trying to renew a services that i got an email confirmation over 0 months_ago that they were renewed .
0	i felt_like i was begging them to take my money .
0	i spent like 0 hours on the phone , explaining to different people that i wuld like to renew several services for my company .
0	especially helpful was an indian fellow called " martin " that i explained 0 times that i would like those and those services renewed , but he just didn_'_t seem to uderstand me .
0	finally i was transfered to an accounting department where operater informed me that the " the numer you have dailed does not exist ".
0	after that i gave up .
0	if i know of anoter company that offered the same services at the same price as formationshouse to which i could transfer my business i would transfer my business in a blink of an eye .
0	really what i experienced in these 0 days was like taken from some comedy movie .
0	:)
0	as an arborist for the last nine years in the uk mainly as well as some work in australia , stihl just work .

0	quick and reasonable .
0	i have ordered multiple_times from supplement_warehouse .
0	there was the initial worry , that i always get with any online purchase , but they came through the first time , and they continue to follow through 000_%.
0	i will always buy my supplements from here , because it is so easy to use , they don_'_t cram in little fees , and they have such great deals on anything you want .
0	if anyone wants deals on good supplements , even the best of my friends , i point them here , to the greatest supplement vendor i have come_across .
0	thanks supplement_warehouse !
0	bought my daughter a barbour_coat .
0	found at here cheaper_than john_lewis ' and also got to use quidco for a further discount .
0	delivery was excellent as well .
0	just the way shopping online should be .
0	thank_you .
0	did a little search after i needed new wheels .
0	went to a few of the big shops got quotes of £_000 for the pair .
0	merlin '_s had a special deal for the same ones but for £_00 .
0	bargain !!
0	next_day delivery as well .
0	terrible experience .
0	no collection for two_days , parcel couldnt be delivered before the required date .
0	useless .
0	then to top it all off there isnt a telephone_number to call , just a typing service !
0	arghh !
0	!
0	ordered two lamps on the 0th of nov , it is now the 00th of dec and still no lamps , every week i call and the delivery is coming in but it never does , avoid at all cost !
0	i picked this company because they offered me what i wanted .
0	customer service team was great to deal with and really listened to what i needed .
0	fast turn_around and always kept me upto_date with information .
0	stay_away they will take the phone and take ages to pay .
0	no phone number to call the company lack of emails from them .
0	i have to admit when i saw the prices , i thought i might be scammed here , looked at a few forums , seemed like mostly positive stuff and thought , why not , i got myself the new dark_souls game and some dlc for civ 0 and i '_m over the moon , i '_ll 000_% be shopping here again in the future , the discounted prices are just too cheap to pass up .
0	i ordered 0 x_0gb patriot memory ordered friday shipped it the same day and it arrived tuesday !
0	customer service was excellent id like to thank jacob who is an asset to memoryc . com who helped_me alot via the online support chat whilst placing my order . this company sets the standard for excellent customer service others can only dream of beating !
0	so hurry and place your order you certainly wont be dissappointed !
0	00 / 00 thank_you memoryc !
0	i was impressed with the speed of delivery .
0	i ordered shoes on saturday and they were delivered on monday_afternoon .
0	i could track the order online although the stated time_slot for delivery was very wide ( 00 : 00 gmt - 00 : 00 ).
0	what did surprise was that the shoes , worth £_000 , were left on the front_doorstep following a knock on the door .
0	i happened to be in and heard the knock but had i not been the shoes would have remained there in full view ; it is a terraced_house with the front_door close the pavement .
0	the driver did not wait to see if the door was answered , leave with a neighbour or hide it behind an available large rose tub .
0	there was no requirement to sign .
0	a comprehensive_range of replacement drill rechargeable_batteries were available .
0	i was able to get a branded item for which i was prepared to pay more .
0	cheaper batteries are available but i have limited confidence in generic brands .
0	quick and efficient service with prompt acknowledgement and progress_reports .
0	i was very pleased with the speed and efficiency of the service i received when ordering a down jacket from webtogs ; their stated returns_policy , which i did not have to use , is reassuringly comprehensive , something that ’_s essential when ordering clothes online and not being certain about fit or quality .
0	the website was readily navigable and informative and i found the range of products and brands to be very comprehensive .
0	i have used a number of outdoor_clothing websites but this site is one i will check out each time in future and would certainly recommend to friends .
0	prise en main et retour rapides !
0	véhicule état neuf , propre et_très récent ( b - max ).
0	equipe très sympa :)
0	as the title_suggests , no_hassle , key received within 00minutes of payment .
0	signfirm are the only company i will trust with our printing_needs !
0	we '_ve had 0 banners and 0 foamex sign so_far with another 0 foamex signs being delivered today .
0	kevin is a true professional and obviously commited to excellent customer service where nothing is too much_trouble , he even emailed me to let_me know i ' d sent the artwork sized in pixels not mm and gave_me the time to adjust and re send !
0	most companies would have used the low quality image and costed us more time and money having it re - printed .
0	i can strongly_recommend signfirm !
0	( and i do quite_frequently !)
0	recently used point 000 for canvas_prints to display in a gallery .
0	the colours are so vibrant and other photographers commented and asked where i got them done .
0	will_definately_use them again !
0	i got more for my money than i did from any other supplement retailer i '_ve ever shopped from
0	a little_bit of fuss needed on my end with verification through my bank , but otherwise everything after that was smooth and quick .
0	my first time using ginger0 , and i will_certainly use them again .
0	great prices , fast delivery and great customer service .
0	will have no_hesitations about recommending them to friends and family .
0	the item was delivered on time , was perfectly packaged and have had no issues at all !
0	really easy site to navigate and always up to date .
0	thanks !
0	i belong to a group called hampshire little drifters in portsmouth and i think i speak for all of them when i say rc_geeks provide a really good service and quick delivery times when ever i need something .
0	we would recommend these_guys to any one .
0	amazing .
0	used mendmyi '_s colour_lab and i '_m extremely impressed by it .
0	phone was sent off using a courier and had it back home less then 00_hours_later .
0	fantastic customer service and great product .
0	i have recommended them to all my friends and i can '_t wait to show off the finished product .
0	for me , getting away from the terrible rates of my service provider was a must .
0	the provider refused to unlock my phone at all , even_though the contract had been completed and they were supposed to offer it for a small fee , they denied the existence of the service and shot me down .
0	as such , mostly to spite them , i decided to try this .
0	it was a bit of a hard bit of cash to drop on something i wasn_'_t completely sure of , but my risk paid off .
0	these_guys did their best to get me unlocked without_any hassles and in as short a time as they could .
0	although it did take them almost 0 days past the original estimated_date to get it done , time is not important to me , the simple fact that they have the connections to get this done is more than enough for me .
0	i truly recommend that anyone who_wants their iphone_unlocked , and is currently running a baseband that cannot otherwise be unlocked with software hacks , turn to these_guys , they '_ll get the job_done .
0	most goods are good quality and reasonably_priced .
0	have noticed that veg are expensive compared to local green grocers
0	have ordered several things from amazon on the run up to christmas , everything arrived promptly and in good condition .
0	prices where also very good
0	thats right i ordered it and it arrived from_hong_kong to the uk within 00_hours which is absolutely astonishing , it came in plenty of packaging and works like a charm :)
0	after it arrived i realised that all the awesome videos i ' d been watching and the channel i subscribed to on youtube were actually by digitalrev . com :)
0	thank_you so much digitalrev . com
0	i am one very unhappy customer , zavi cancelled my order , i bought a bluray collection in good faith as it was a " one day special " at a great price .
0	instead of getting a great offer i get fobbed_off with a 00_%_discount_code , if they can '_t get there prices right then they should hire someone to double_check prices , there mess up has let_me down as i wanted some for myself and a set as a present , most companies would honor most orders like this instead zavvi give us long_standing customers a kick in the teeth with a 00_%_discount :(
0	zavi as a company has lost my respect and i will do my best to avoid buying anything from both there websites and your stores ( and sister stores ) in the future .
0	this is media suicide and i am not happy .
0	for the past two years i have used skiddle to buy tickets for sankeys , the warehouse project , creamfields and more .
0	sometimes the tickets come by email , sometimes in the post .
0	once they went missing .
0	every time i use this company the communication is excellent , the staff are helpful and i get what i need when i need it .
0	it '_s nice not to have to talk too a company , but when you do they listen , and they resolve .
0	i really cannot_fault this company .
0	everything was booked correctly and the weekend was great fun .
0	i would use chillisauce again and reccomend them to others .
0	many_thanks .
0	i searched around before buying some extra memory for my pc .
0	all the uk suppliers , mr_memory included , charged roughly the same for the particular piece of hardware i needed - give or take a few_pence .
0	so , i ' d rate the pricing as average .
0	the delivery , however , was brilliant .
0	i chose free first_class delivery when placing my order and it arrived the next_day .
0	can '_t_argue with that .
0	overall , definitely a trusted site to buy components from .
0	i ordered a bag on monday and they sent me a text_message on tuesday to ask if i wanted it on wed or thurs .
0	i said thurs and on thurs they said it would come between 0 : 00 and 0 : 00 .
0	0 : 00 on the dot , the door_bell rang :-)
0	yesterday my xbox_gold ran_out and i started looking around for the cheapest 00 month code .
0	i came_across simplycdkeys / simplygames and they were selling it at £_00 which i was very happy with .
0	that '_s 0 pounds_cheaper_than amazon !
0	i will_def buy from this website again in the future :)
0	the best site for aussie babe videos .
0	would definitely recommend and use again
0	fantastic company to deal with .
0	prompt service and no_hassles .
0	couldn_'_t be simpler or quicker .
0	wish i knew about these_guys sooner .
0	ordered 0 items of oakley clothing at good prices , fast delivery however : one item sent was wrong_colour and wrong_size , the packaging , altho damaged , was clearly_marked with product size & colour and also a sticker stating that they would accept returns on this item ( which under these circumstances would be a breach of uk consumer_law incidentally ), the despatch note had been ticked beside each item in biro giving me the impression that this company will send anything rather_than provide decent customer service and communicate with the customer and offer a refund or alternative product .
0	decided it wasn_'_t worth my time , money & energy to arrange return postage & refund potentially having to argue the legal position versus their returns_policy , instead will pass on wrong item as gift to somebody who it fits and vent my spleen via an honest review ergo good products at decent price , incompetent order processing & despatch , poor customer focus & service , thanks for reading .
0	after being sent the wrong items on 0 occaisions i was contacted by a man (?)
0	named [_name removed_] whom i later discovered to be a senior partner of the company who acted as tho it was my fault that they were unable to send the advertised product as well as informing_me that some people " just have an orgasm out of making a complaint ", accused me ( wrongly ) of being a member of the competition and informed me that they didn_'_t want me as a customer anyway and that i could go to watchdog or trading_standards if i wanted .
0	having looked into the sale of goods_act_0000 , and despite [_name removed_] quoting the company '_s returns_policy , which does not supercede consumer_law , i know that i am not required to pay for return postage on these goods and can require them to arrange_collection at their expense , which i will choose to do following the arrogant , rude and unprofessional behaviour of this senior_member of the company .
0	i will not comtemplate using their services again and would strongly_advise others to similarly avoid this firm if this is their idea of customer service , the value they have of their customers and the example which the management are setting for their staff .
0	i haven_'_t been using the website very long ( since about august ) and it has_been exceptional !
0	being a bit of an online shopaholic i '_ve spent quite a bit online , especially with the run up to christmas and i have already had cash_back verified and paid back into my bank_account .
0	some payments are slower_than others , but a bit of patience certainly pays off .
0	only ever had one item not track properly which was probably my fault but the customer_care crew jumped on it and it was resolved in no time .
0	bargain price , pre order game turned_up a day earlier_than release_date !
0	what more could i ask for
0	i '_ve recently built a new high - end computer from parts , and after_researching a lot online , i ordered most of my parts from aria .
0	let_me detail the experience :
0	price
0	aria . co . uk has some of the lowest_prices in the market .
0	their offers are actually offers ( not just random price - matches and fake advertising ), but the real deal and a great bargain .
0	offering
0	the large variety of items on aria '_s website make it easy to shop .
0	they have a ton of products , and while other_retailers might have more , you ' d still find many of the items you might want .
0	shipping
0	at first , i was put off by the fact that aria doesn_'_t offer an amazon - esque free shipping scheme for larger orders , but instead ask you to pay for their designated courier ( dpd ).
0	but you know what ?
0	that is possibly one of their biggest positive elements : the service they use is flawless !
0	dpd has an amazing service standard , being the only service that you can actually track on a map , with a 0 hour interval of delivery .
0	everything arrived flawlessly packaged , and without_any damage .
0	amazing !
0	customer service
0	i '_ll admit to not using their customer service so_far .
0	everything worked just fine , and dispatch was very fast .
0	however , when you receive an e_- mail , a few_days after your order , from an account_manager telling you that any time you '_ll want to order ( something large i ' d assume ) in the future , you are eligible for bespoke prices and suggestions ... you can '_t help but feel like a treasured client .
0	all in all : mind blown !
0	aria is clearly my favourite it shop now .
0	i would recomend this company to anyone selling a mobile_phone .
0	i '_ve tried other_companys in the past and always had problems .
0	requested a free post bag to send my mobile , this came through the post within a day !
0	sent my mobile off same day and the cash was in my bank the following_morning !!
0	!
0	0_stars , well_done mazumamobile
0	they have everything here and at a great price .
0	i was already going to checkout at another website when my friend texts me this website ( he knew i was looking to save ) .
0	so i checked it out and got the same things and saved like thirty bucks .
0	i will never go_anywhere_else .
0	always best prices - and you can price match instantly to any website .
0	always free stuff offered - and very easy to get free shipping .
0	best supplement store to purchase from online .
0	des_prix moins chers serais bien venu ...
0	le service et_la rapidité_de_livraison rien_à dire !
0	super !
0	merci
0	toute l ' opperation s ' est_bien derroulé !
0	on peut leur faire confiance car j ' ai testé et ca marche !!!
0	!
0	merci encore
0	i ' d never shopped at chemical_records before and was really surprised at how great their customer service .
0	i ordered something just after xmas and the next_day i had 0 emails waiting for me saying my order had been processed and then shipped , and it arrived in the post the day after that .
0	it arrived well_packaged and even got a free poster / calendar !
0	i ' d definitely shop there again and would reccomend
0	super service , pre_- order arrived on time and money wasn_'_t taken until dispatch , would purchase from simplygames again !
0	purchased an acoustic_guitar from dv000 an_hour before the next_day delviery deadline .
0	the guitar didnt arrive next_day .
0	when i called customer_services they explained that there had been a warehouse issue but it would be shipped and i would receive the following_day .
0	guitar arrived the following_day and is great , just wish they had let_me know that it hadnt shipped originally so that i didnt sit around waiting for delivery !
0	i ordered my fender_strat from guitarguitar and specified a saturday delivery , order was easy and processed quickly .
0	i checked that the real time stock was updated on the website and was pleased to see that it was !
0	i really loved the personal_touch i got when rich from the sales_team called me to let_me know that my guitar had been dispatched .
0	the guitar arrived first thing on saturday_morning , i even received a text_message_informing_me of the time frame .
0	great service , i have had no issues with the guitar , love playing it and would definately purchase from guitar_guitar again !
0	the trophy was poorly made .
0	you can tell that they put hardly_any effort into the work , for example , the box was completely ripped on the side .
0	the star piece on the trophy can be told that you simply just glued it on , this made it look like you didn_'_t even make the glass part of the model .
0	when they actually glued on the star , it was badly glued because their was a lot of glue coming out of the side .
0	it seems really good on the website but in reality , it didn_'_t really feel like a trophy .
0	superb service and very helpful staff ( samantha )
0	xbl code didn_'_t work , double_checked it several_times at still no luck .
0	ripped_off
0	what can i say these_guys are great , easy to use website made it very painless to consign my box , and also offered the best price to new_zealand to suit my needs .
0	i would use them again in the future without_hesitation .
0	well_done to everyone at courierpoint and many_thanks for the great service you offer .
0	i was looking for prestone bugwash windscreen wash which is spot on in the warmer months for getting_rid of that fly splat on the windscreen !
0	normally retails for over £ 0 . 00 in a well_known car parts store in the uk but concord were selling it for a lot less and next_day delivery too , so i saved a packet on this product , thanks for a easy transaction and a speedy turnaround on my order .
0	tyre_shopper is really straight_forward to use , with a vast_choice of tyre manufacturers to choose from .
0	i have used black_circles in the past and must_say that i prefered tyre_shopper for choice and price
0	would happily purchase more tyres through this website in the future , top job to all concerned .
0	i have bought all my goods in store but thought_id try buying online .
0	it was great items arrived on time and i didnt even have to go out .
0	will buy online again .
0	i needed some money that day so couldn_'_t go to the back for a loan .
0	i '_ve not used a payday_loan site before but thought i ' d give it a go .
0	i got the see how much i would have to pay back so there was no_hidden_costs .
0	the money was sent to my account that day which was great .
0	i made sure i paid the full_amount back at the end of the month and that was that .
0	the site was easy to use and if i needed a quick loan again i would use them again .
0	thanks .
0	only place i could_find that had the parts i needed .
0	very helpful will use again .
0	000000000
0	commande expédiée rapidement .

0	no issues , flowers were great , no_problems with delivery
0	have used them a number of times and never had an issue .
0	i have used ebuyer for many_years an have never encountered any issue .
0	fast and reliable delivery with great prices gets my vote every time .
0	keep_up the great service .
0	i am not normally one for writing_reviews but bulkpowders have never once let_me down in product or service .
0	if you wanted a good model of " how to " run a online order website these_guys have nailed it .
0	keep_up the good work and them prices low guys !

0	thanks ...++++
0	brilliant service no_complaints
0	i could easily check out any city to see prices , reviews and locations .
0	the map_view was helpful to visually see where they were .
0	i like how prices were real time .
0	no booking_fees made it nice as well .
0	my stag_do booked thru chillisauce was great , top quality locations and events .
0	no_complaints !
0	thanks .
0	i done a hpi_check on my car just_incase there was any_issues with the car and to put my mind at ease before folking out £_00 , 000 .
0	yes it does the job yes the car was clear with nothing to report but at a cost of £_00 for nothing to report i think is expensive .
0	could at_least give you 00_% back if nothing to report on car .
0	they state 0 mobiles in stock , they take payment within 0 days -- 00 days_later im still_waiting for my phone !
0	i look on the website for an update my phone is now being advertised £_00 cheaper , and i still dont have my phone with 0 showing in stock !
0	do not trust this company and do not purchase anything - you have been_warned !
0	im now contacting my credit_card company to sort this mess out and refund me !
0	there customer service is non_existent !
0	this company should be closed_down .
0	shame on you !
0	et utroligt højt kortgebyr ( mastercard ) på 00 kr !
0	som_jeg_ikke føler at der bliver gjort ordenligt opmærksom på ( og selv fakturaen nævner det kun indirekte ved at lægge gebyret til buketprisen ... så ser det jo nok lidt mindre farligt ud ?).
0	desuden er hjemmesiden sådan indrettet at det_er_meget svært at hoppe frem og tilbage i bestillingsprocessen , så_jeg 0 . måtte starte forfra et_par gange ved fejlvalg 0 . på betalingsskærmen ikke kunne gå tilbage for at se hvorfor at prisen med_et var 00 kr højere end jeg_havde regnet med , og derfor blev nød til bare at betale for ikke at skulle starte helt forfra igen .
0	desuden er_der 00 prisintervaller fra 000 - 000_kr på div .
0	buketter .
0	på billedet ser man buketten til ca 000 - 000_kr , så hvis_man vælger en buket til under eller over dette beløb ved man jo reelt ikke hvor meget eller hvad_man_får for pengene .
0	utrolig nem bestilling_og_hurtig_levering .
0	jeg_er_meget_tilfreds og mega glad for mine nye bukser :-)
0	købte en_vare for over 000_kr og_fik_den tilsendt portofrit langt hurtigere end jeg_havde forventet .
0	godt produkt og_hurtig_levering .
0	not much to say , they are simply the best .
0	i really like the concept off the " inn '_s "!
0	diveinn trekkin swimminn and so on .
0	it is such a good place to find your gear , and the service is outstanding !
0	indian_call_centre .
0	who told me what i wanted to hear but never noted account told me i would get call back as soon as sorted issue .
0	no call back .
0	called them back to explain again to be hung_up on .
0	never dealing_with them again .
0	all the info you need on livingston and great forums .
0	0rd time using the service which only seems to get better each time .
0	within 0 days of deciding to sell , day 0 i received my postage pack , day 0 it was received and day 0 i received my money .
0	cannot_praise the company enough .
0	same as above .
0	the camera lumix ft0 what i ordered on wednesday has arrived next_day before 0am with free delivery and the best price on market .
0	customer service was helpful , they promised me camera will be to friday and they have kept this promise .
0	i can recommend this company with pleasure .
0	will_definitely use them again .
0	i was looking to get some perfumes for xmas gifts and i came_across this website .
0	they have good range of products and at great discounted prices .
0	i think its because its xmas_period but if they were to give discount to returning customers ... i will_definitely make more purchases .
0	im very happy with my products ... all brand_new and sealed in the original packagine .
0	also fast delivery service .
0	i initially contacted them for replacement parts for an old strimmer , but ended_up buying a new one from them anyway .
0	i would definitely use them again for their quick_turnaround and good price .
0	great price , great availability but awful service .
0	i have just sold my watch to watchfinder .
0	customer service is second to none , sent my watch and within 00_hours had a call back with a great offer .
0	quick and professional service with excellent results .
0	would definitely use again .
0	they managed to get product that was out of stock everywhere_else .
0	minor_niggle is that i only placed the order because the website said it was in stock .
0	very frustrating when website says in stock only for an email to come later saying the product is actually on order .
0	however they came through and managed to secure the product which was then delivered quickly .
0	goods come next_day with no charge to delivery charge , good condition well_packed a * will use again .
0	ordered the samsung_galaxy on friday , was told to expect delivery on monday .
0	here it is .
0	everything is connected and activated .
0	lovely !
0	thanks cpw !
0	ordered multiple_times , always correct items and delivered next_day .
0	very competent communication_throughout the ordering_process .
0	great great great company , got turned on to them by a friend and they are my go to place when it comes to buying supplements !!
0	!
0	i ordered a set of speakers and they didn_'_t arrive .
0	these things_happen with postal services and i don_'_t blame pixamania for this .
0	what i did find , however was a poor uncaring customer service department .
0	i '_ve asked for a refund , but really , based on the experiences i '_ve had thus_far , i '_m not holding out much hope .
0	was looking for months at a 00_inch samsung plasma_tv on the currys / comet websites as the price had been dropped by £_000 to £ 0000 .
0	i decided to wait for the price to drop a little more before i would order it as the newer_model had just been released and i thought that as it was at the end of its line they would knock a bit more off .
0	after weeks of waiting it finally dropped by another £_000 , so i rounded all the cash up to pay for it , but i had pushed my luck too far and missed out .
0	all the time i was waiting for the price to drop i regularly googled the product number of the tv and come_across a website that was advertising this tv at £ 0000 , i searched its address on googlemaps and came_across the shop on the street in blackpool , it looked good so i gave them a ring , turned_out that they are a family business .
0	a lad named simon took my call , he was a cool fella who knew his stuff about audio / visual products , he was a great help .
0	the bad_news was that they no_longer had the tv in store , but simon offered the newer_model at a similar price , i asked_him to give me a day or two to raise the cash which he was cool about , he put no preasure on me to buy there and then .
0	i gave him a call the followng day to confirm , he talked_me through signing in on the website and purchasing the tv , gave_me a delivery date and promised me two free hdmi_cables .
0	i had a phonecall from the delivery driver the night before asking if i wanted delivery of my tv a day earlier , i was over the moon , although i didn_'_t need help i was given the impression he would help to start my tv up with me .
0	steve the delivery driver was a smashing chap too .
0	i can_honestly_say that i am extremely happy with the customer service of reliant_direct , couldn_'_t have had better service .
0	thankyou simon and steve for your help .
0	if you ' re looking at the big_name stores for visual / audio products do yourselves a favour , at the same time take a look at reliantdirect . co . uk - you will not be disappointed , you will get a better deal and excellent customer service !
0	!
0	alright dave , how are things ?
0	yeah , not bad , just got back from amsterdam , it was really good .
0	a company called chilli_sauce organised everything and it all went very smoothly , did some cool shit that we would never of done if they hadn_'_t been involved .
0	you should use them for that lads trip you were planning .
0	have made a couple of big orders from this site , and both_times i have received extremely good service .
0	there were a couple of little problems with a cymbal_bag in this order , but the team at the shop always contacted me with new updates , and were very quick and professional with getting everything sorted .
0	will_definitely be spending more money here soon !
0	: d
0	great service , stock and equipment i would order frequently from this shop if i wasn_'_t so poor !.
0	i have only had one issue where i could not understand the man on the phone but hey gotta laugh about stuff like that .
0	keep_up the good work msuk .
0	stocks almost everything with great deals .
0	i am really happy with the postage as its always on time or before time with no trouble .
0	it also is really easy to sell on and accepts all payment types .
0	all the stores are generally entertaining and fun with a wide_range of media and gadgets .
0	the prices are very much average with little deals .
0	what puts me off about hmv is the postage sucks always late !
0	and the staff rarely help out .
0	but over all not to bad .
0	simplyscuba has always provided me with outstanding service , even in the case where i needed to return faulty goods .
0	the most basic of delivery options still gets you your goods fast , and they always come nicely_packaged .
0	i '_ve yet to buy anything reletively expensive in the way of dive_gear , but i '_ll definately be purchasing it from simplyscuba .
0	ordered online , quick and easy ...
0	delivery on the morning of the second day .
0	brilliant product .
0	this place has saved our company a considerable_amount on inks and allows me to order quick with relative_ease .
0	unlocked quick
0	having just bought a nintendo_0ds , i needed a good quality case to protect it whilst travelling , out of all the places i searched hitari had the official branded nintendo case at the lowest_price , so overall it was a no_brainer .
0	the case arrived really quickly and i was pleased with the communication and overall order process with hitari .
0	definitely hope to deal with them again in the future .
0	after deciding to finally get myself a gaming_pc , i decided that it would be best to go to a custom builder rather_than try it myself and it actually turned_out cheaper to get it built professionally .
0	i was unsure_about a lot of specialist builders are reading endless reviews of bad practise , but a friend recommended cyberpower_systems to me and after_searching for alternatives and pricing up my build , it seemed the cheapest to do with cyberpower_systems .
0	the customer_support was brilliant , i contacted them via facebook and they responded quickly and kept me updated with the progress of my order , they even changed out the motherboard and wifi adapter ( due to size ) for no extra_cost .
0	even after my order had been delivered the support remains prompt and very useful , a great choice and excellent build quality and cable_management .
0	only_downside is that due to the protection put inside my case one of the fans isn_'_t connected and i haven_'_t yet connected it up .
0	i would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a custom_build pc , whether it be for gaming or just a specific pc built to the specifications you want .
0	having been a customer of toolkit_websites now for many_years , the service is still outstanding , arguably it '_s getting better and better .
0	often when a prospect becomes a customer the level of service can dwindle ; this is not the case here .
0	our telephone_calls are always answered quickly and if our problems can '_t be resolved straight_away they are dealt_with usually within minutes .
0	a very good example of a company which practices what it preaches .
0	ok , so my first formal sales training and my billing increased by 000_% after just a few sessions .
0	i bought myself a new car with the commission .
0	i would recommend mindcell to anyone looking to increase their sales .
0	two websites that i couldn_'_t have done without in planning my prague to paris cycle trip in april ....
0	i used hostelbookers to make two hostel bookings one in paris and other in pilsen in czech ... both_times booking was as easy as searching on google ....
0	kudos to hostelbookers team and add some loyalty element
0	easily the most user_friendly booking service available on the internet .
0	a frequent_traveller '_s best friend !
0	very easy to transact with and fast shipment .
0	received the parcel only within the week .
0	great quality authentic sunglasses but at a cheaper price !
0	will_definitely recommend this company to my friends .
0	more power !
0	itsjustcricket offer a superb service , paul even went out of his way to help me out .
0	i received a limited_edition quality bat .
0	it had knots on the face of the bat but even worse was the fact that stickers had been removed and new ones placed on the bat .
0	there had been some attempt to sand away the marks left by the old stickers .
0	was i really buying a limited_edition £_000 bat .... i '_m not sure ................. so i sent it back .
0	i have used gamexchange . co . uk for over four months now and i '_ve never had a problem !
0	the trade - in prices are very good and that '_s the main_reason_why i use them .
0	other_retailers just rip you off with trade - in prices but gamexchange are fair .
0	and transactions take place very quickly .
0	every time i have posted my games first_class i '_ve been paid the very next_day !
0	all of the new games i have bought are new and sealed so no problem there .
0	and the customer service is excellent .
0	always very helpful and quick to reply .
0	overall , i highly_recommend gamexchange . co . uk .
0	if you ' re into video_games you won_'_t be disappointed !
0	i '_ve_used simplygames a few_times and never had a problem !
0	delivery is free and only takes a day to deliver after despatch .
0	their prices for newly - released games or pre_- orders are normally very reasonable and this is why i use them .
0	and the quick delivery is an added_bonus .
0	my only complaint would be the choice of games and the prices of games that have been out for a while .
0	there needs to be a bigger selection of games but , apart_from this , simplygames are highly_recommended !
0	i have used pc_specialist before and they never_disappoint .
0	it is built professionally and works like a dream .
0	it '_s the best way to buy a pc , the parts i wanted but put_together by someone_who_knows what they are doing .
0	have been using maximuscle products for a while now and they are always great .
0	their service is also brilliant with quick dispatch and delivery .
0	pre_- ordered mass_effect 0 it came a day early so nothing to complain_about a great site to buy from .
0	i '_ve_used ebuyer a few_times now , always has exactly_what i '_m looking for at a pretty good price , postage is quite expensive on certain items , but apart_from that , never had any_problems
0	very quick responses i . e .
0	the envelope to send off , and sending the cheque back ... good prices paid also !
0	i buyed lots of keys from oks and all keys war working and was really fast , 00 stars !
0	it '_s difficult to praise diamondgeezer . com enough - in my experience both luke and tian were great throughout the entire_process of buying my wife '_s engagement_ring .
0	buying an_engagement or wedding_ring should be a fun and happy experience , and the guys at diamondgeezer made sure it was .
0	so much so that we bought both our_wedding_rings from them as well ; and on recommendation to my friends , they too have bought their wedding_rings from them !
0	i '_ll be in touch in a few anniversaries ' time when i need to upgrade my wife '_s rock !
0	i had a slight_issue with the delivery address but how swift they fixed it , i don_'_t understand , because of that , i was expecting my guitar to arrive in perhaps 0 days , i was socked to receive it the next_morning , and i love my sleep but i couldn_'_t sleep any more because of how excited and impressed i was .
0	all am trying to say is , the item was delivered as expected and in perfect_condition .
0	i don_'_t think services get any better_than that .
0	thank_you gear0 , and keep_up the good work , you just might sock someone_else like you did me .
0	great service all_round !
0	received my game instantly and with added dlc !!
0	autokey_system is great , site is easy to navigate and understand !
0	thanks to cjs : d
0	could not be_happier with the service i received , ordered one afternoon and received the next_morning !
0	would recommend to anyone looking for great prices and quick reliable service !
0	i have to say i was lost on the website and i couldn_'_t find the page i was looking for .
0	i saw the chat option and figured i haven_'_t tried anything_else .
0	within 0 minutes i was on the right page and ready to get back to work .
0	i want to personally thank millie for being concise , to the point , understanding and all around nice .
0	she is superb at customer service .
0	another great transaction from simply cd_keys !
0	i have the code emailed within minutes and it worked_perfectly again , giving me another awesome game to play on origin for £_00 cheaper then ea / origin are selling exactly the same thing for !!
0	!
0	i ordered a new flow boiler from the electrical counter and its arrived in great order !
0	plus the price offered me a great saving , so i will_certainly be back again to see how much i can save on any other electricals :)
0	in fact , i am going to be getting some new carpets for my new house soon , so i will be ordering some new switches and sockets from these_guys to go with the new modern look i want in my house :)
0	i got those new sockets and they look great !
0	a bit thumbs_up for price , speed of delivery and the high_quality of the nexus plug sockets !
0	i just wanted to do a short review on these_guys because i got a couple of door_handles from them and found them to be of high_quality and for a very competitive price from what i could_find on other_sites like this .
0	thanks for saving me some money and i almost_forgot to mention , the delivery was rather fast too which is something i always look for when ordering products online :)
0	hi ,
0	just submitting a review for a friend who has used the laundry repair services from laundry 000 .
0	she asked me to say ...
0	laundry 000 have supplied me with some top quality laundry machines and a repair service which has_proven to be the best choice for my commercial laundry shop .
0	not only did i get provided with the best washing_machines i have used , but i have also signed_up to the repair services offered which i have found to be priceless due to the speed in which my machines are bought back to top work order so not to loss any business .
0	thank_you so much for providing one of the best services i have ever had from_start to finish and beyond !
0	i don_'_t know why people below have given bad_reviews , i have had nothing but good with bathroom c &_c .
0	i order some new taps mid last_week as we had to replace the taps in our bath due to them being old , and they where at my door 0 days_later !
0	i think either the reviews below can '_t be true or bathroom c &_c have had a major improvement because i can tell you now , i would recommend the great customer service and low_prices to all my friends and will be back to order a new shower at the end of the week !
0	a +++++ thanks so much :)
0	thanks so much for the help with my order after_placing it on the new website ( which looks amazing by the way !
0	), once i had placed my order i phoned the door store to find out how long my order would take as i need it for this weekend coming and was told it would be with me before the weekend :)
0	along with the fast delivery , i have managed to save a good amount of money on a large tin of sadolin wood_stain to stain my new back door ready to go up over the weekend .
0	thanks so much for a easy to use service which has saved me money !
0	a ++
0	hi , just wanted to add a quick review to say thanks for the help with finding the correct fixings i was after for around my house over the weekend :)
0	fix0 was very helpful and had everything i needed at very competitive_prices , along with great delivery !
0	this meant i was able to do most of the diy work around the house over the weekend .
0	i ordered a new swimming_pool from splash and relax mid last_week , and finally got around to setting it up over the weekend :)
0	i had a couple of friends over for some drinks and we decided it would be fun to have a play in the pool ( i know the weather was not great , but we was drinking so that didn_'_t matter lol ), anyway , the pool was great fun and the perfect size for having some friends over for a small pool party , just like we asked for and was advised this pool would be ideal for .
0	so all in all , a great pool and some top advice from the guys at splash and relax .
0	thanks soooooo much for making our weekend so much fun :) a +++++
0	i have used ryanair twice in the last two years to go to spain and back ( so that four flights with them in total ) and each and everyone of those flights with them where great !
0	the staff where friendly and funny , which to me is very important if i '_m going to be stuck on a plan for x hours going on holiday ( or back from ).
0	also they where always sure to ask if i wanted a drink when passing and asked if i was comfortable .
0	and to finish it off , when i feel asleep i was not pestered during or after the flight , i was only woken_up just before landing so i know we where about to land .
0	and to finish it off , when leaving the plan ( on every flight there and back ) all the cabin staff said thank_you and good bye with a smile !
0	over all from_start to finish i have always had great flights with ryanair and so i will_continue to use them time after time !
0	a +++++++
0	we hired a minibus for a works do last_week and the service from our drive was top_notch !
0	he was so professional and polite and was just like having one of our own driving once he got joking around with us :)
0	i would most defo recommend britannia to anyone that asks me because it was just such a great trip for all of us and the coach or rather minibus , was so luxurious .
0	you couldn_'_t have had more comfort with a limo lol
0	i ordered a small custom lcd monitor from kme to use on my bike ( off road baby !)
0	and its perfect :) the screen is well_designed and very protected of damage from bits flying up and the odd smash .
0	over all very pleased with the product , sales and customer_support .
0	a + highly_recommend for anyone thats looking for a custom lcd monitor , rugged display or even a lcd monitor in general .
0	from_start to finish chillisauce ' customer service has_been attentive and knowledgeable , i will not_hesitate to recommend them to a friend !
0	our stag_weekend was hassle_free and knowing that one of their operators was at the end of the telephone in case of incident was comforting ...
0	will most definitely be back !
0	sold my galaxy_s0 for argos_vouchers , safe and securely with a free special delivery service .
0	received confirmation e_- mail and passed test e_- mail next_day .
0	received my gift_card in 0 working_days .
0	the whole_transaction took less_than a week .
0	after receiving my welcome_pack through the post on saturday i then posted my phone back to mazuma on monday_morning .
0	payment was made to me tuesday .
0	could not believe_how quick the process was .
0	i '_ve found my new supplement store .
0	i '_ve been buying from retail locations for years .
0	i started shopping from supplement_warehouse and only go into a store now to ask what they think about a product i plan on buying from these_guys .
0	great service , fast shipping , cheap process .
0	what more can you ask for ?
0	this is one of the best websites in my opinion .
0	it '_s easy to use search and sort functions bring you so much comfort .
0	making your time spent searching and reviewing a place to stay so much shorter .
0	the honest open concept of comparing hostels and its ' easy booking makes it hassle_free .
0	the best part is that they allow you to cancel your bookings at no extra_charge so long as its 0 days before arrival .
0	i '_ve ordered from ebuyer now several_times and have been extremely happy with communication from ebuyer updating me as to the progress of my orders .
0	excellent value to or most items .
0	never had any_issues with any items received from ebuyer .
0	certainly recommend .
0	my phone was in perfect working order when it left - however , mazuma claimed it was damaged and not working on arrival to them .
0	on top of this , i opted for argos_vouchers .
0	i did not receive vouchers , but a card which needs a 0000 number to be called to activate it .
0	i am profoundly deaf and unable to use a telephone .
0	i merely use my mobile for texting instead of using a conventional phone .
0	they now have my mobile and i am unable to activate my cards - so i have lost out .
0	i won_'_t use again .
0	had a great time at the stagg do that was arranged my chillisauce .
0	the hotel that they picked was comfy and the activities were fun .
0	easiest_way to find accommodation anywhere in the world
0	i '_ve been dealing_with companies like virgin and bt for years .
0	the guys at sermores far_exceeded the levels of customer service i usually get and all for a cheaper price than wholesale prices i usually pay .
0	sermores provided my new offices with voip and internet connectivity with none of missed deadlines and issues i '_ve come to expect from larger companies . they '_ve even offered to do me a good deal when my mobile_phone contracts expire soon , i can '_t wait to deal with them again as it '_s been an_absolute_pleasure so_far .
0	this websites customer_support and live help is the most easiest iv seen online .
0	things which take_forever with other huge organization are done within_seconds via the online_chat .
0	things like full refunds due to bookings made by mistake , or re bookings of existing collections .
0	i feel absolute trust with this company , they have always resolved the countless issues that occur in the shipping business we operate in .
0	will_continue to be my first choice for shipping .
0	had a guy take my car from guildford up to a garage in essex for repair , very good delivery and nice friendly guy .
0	took me and the car , even stopped for coffee on the way !
0	this company has_been problems since day 0 .
0	wish i ' d read_reviews before using them ...
0	they set_up payment on 00th of each_month after taking the £_000 deposit ...
0	i told them this payment date was unnaceptable , as i got paid on the 0th .
0	they have kept trying to take payment on the wrong date , which has made my bank cancel and refuse further direct_debits .
0	now they have cancelled my policy , charging me £_00 !
0	i '_ve asked them if they ' d set_up a new policy on the correct date .
0	and they said yes , for £_000 more than it was 0 months_ago , and a £_000 increase on the deposit !
0	i am now just going to a proper insurance company .
0	thanks for nothing auto direct , i will spend all day if i have to posting this review all over the internet .
0	shambles .
0	used first time for flight booking ...... offered the cheapest ticket good website and good customer service .
0	where to start !
0	a wonderful way to spend that free time ... winning money !
0	i started with £_00 and soon built it up !
0	always get what you pay hence_why i use these_guys .
0	comprehensive site found a lot more hostels than other services and also prices seems to be slightly_cheaper_than other_sites .
0	they could try to reduce the price of their products .
0	the same products , with same quality and same standard , i '_ve seen else where sold for even low_prices , e . g .
0	such as india and even some european_countries .
0	i guess they are okay for british market ( as they appear to have lower prices then their rivals ).
0	its not so bad , when you , think britain , is known as rip_off , capital of europe .
0	may take the opportunity to thank_you , for your kind and generous reminder , to my review .
0	i was asked by trustpilot to express my honest_opinions and not to bestow appraisal on anyone in particular .
0	i simply expressed general opinion of the state of uk market .
0	i would like assure you , that you were not target .
0	i would like to thank_you again for time and custom .
0	thank_you , best luck with the future .
0	levering inden for en_dag .
0	venlig telefon betjening .
0	fik pakken efter 0_dage og_det_var postens skyld .
0	god service blev ringede op og_fik et bedre produkt for samme pris fordi de_ikke havde det_jeg_havde_bestilt
0	i '_ve been emailing despatch bay for over four months now , but they haven_'_t even responded let_alone provided me with the vat_invoice required by uk legislation when you charge vat on goods or services !
0	basically , they ' re not interested once they '_ve got your money .
0	will never use them again and would recommend everyone to steer_well clear .
0	ccs leeds have a reliable , well connected network and have always been an utter pleasure to deal with .
0	they '_ve always gone above and beyond the call of duty for me and have helped_me out of tough spots .
0	rackspace are happy to engage in misleading billing practises and if you dare to question them about it , then they will keep stating the same , irrelevant point over and again before eventually just ignoring you .
0	utterly disgusting behaviour .
0	parcel0go are a terrible company to deal with that clearly have no regard for their customers or the service that they provide .
0	they failed to collect the parcel on the scheduled date , then when i took it to the depot the member of staff that i spoke to said that they were closed and they couldn_'_t let_me drop_off the parcel despite it already being paid for ...
0	when i took the parcel back and the depot finally accepted it , i was surprised to find that it didn_'_t even show up as having been received at the depot and scanned on the tracking for 0 whole days , which was particularly disappointing given that i had paid for a 00 hour delivery service !
0	the parcel was eventually delivered to the recipient 0 days_later .
0	when i complained to parcel0go about their unacceptable performance , i was told that the terms and conditions_state that this service was not guaranteed and so they didn_'_t care .
0	i challenged that i was looking at the terms and conditions and that was simply not the case , however the representative simply kept stating that they do not offer a guaranteed service and that this is in their terms and conditions .
0	after such appalling service , i would never use parcel0go again .
0	i have previously had similarly poor experience with them deliberately delaying sending forms for an insurance claim in order to prevent a claim being made before the time limit .
0	with parcel0go , poor customer service seems to come as standard .
0	unreliable service , always late , often lost and / or damaged .
0	unhelpful staff and incorrect depot opening_hours on their web - site .
0	they don_'_t even bother_replying to e_- mails when you complain , your parcel just mysteriously turns_up two_weeks late ...
0	i can '_t think of a company that i would trust less .
0	securacert make use of aggressive cold_calling and spam e_- mailing to try and win sales by misleading customers into thinking that they are renewing their ssl_certificates with the existing company rather_than purchasing a new certificate through securacert .
0	on multiple_occasions i have contacted quietpc . com '_s pre_- sales and have been astonished by the effort they have put into helping_me choose the most appropriate components for a particular requirement even when just selling me an £ 0 fan - they bend_over_backwards to make you feel_confident that you are purchasing the best products for you need and even recommend cheaper products than the ones you have picked out if they feel you ' re wasting your money .
0	i can '_t recommend them highly_enough !
0	very good value for money and delivery as promptly .
0	all items as_described .
0	one of the safest and most reliable places to get cheap cd_keys - very fast too and fast responses to any_queries .
0	it completely beats other_websites when it comes to book an stay .
0	everything is so simple and easy .
0	i '_m waiting for an android_app to make my bookings !
0	excellent games for an amazing price !
0	quick and easy to order and keys are delivered almost_instantly .
0	great site , will use again in future .
0	as any other online shopper we always look for the best deals .
0	supplement_warehouse by far has the best deals and makes it 00 times better by having a do it yourself price matcher .
0	i only had one issue where i messed_up on a price match and was never informed , so a suggestion would be if my order is not processed within a couple days i should get an email or a text , any type of notification .
0	another cool idea , being a monthly buyer , i think it would be cool if you guys did a rewards_program thing .
0	but overall despite some reviews of credit fraud i have not had an issue and a very satisfied customer .
0	thank_you suppelment warhouse .
0	they hands_down have the best prices around .
0	although their shipping may prove to tally up a bit with larger orders , it still doesn_'_t matter .
0	their prices are still cheap enough to save .
0	just lined everything in my cart and compared prices to two other main sites that i have also purchased at before , and even with the shipping factored in i still saved over twenty bucks ordering with supplementwharehouse .
0	unlike a couple of sites i had visited where they claimed the product was in stock , then to find out that it was ' nt .
0	( once the transaction had taken place ) echo sent emails to provide information on the successful transaction and also the dispatch and delivery date .
0	also one of the cheapest supplement websites out there .
0	will be ordering from them again .
0	i received a product on a day i would normally expect from a fast service , meaning next_day after sending , which was day after i bought it ( late shopping ;)) no shipping confirmation but with that speed its not an issue for me at all .
0	product came well_packed , or should i say amazingly well top_notch :)
0	recommended !!
0	!

0	here are the highlights :
0	item purchased not as_described on the website .
0	( bike should have included stabilisers )
0	' customer service ' advisor unable to advise me if the item should even include stabilisers , despite the fact that he website states that it does !
0	offers me an exchange , but cannot guarantee if the stabilisers will be included .
0	in the light of the above we therefore arrange for a collection and refund .
0	courier arrives on the day of the collection during the two hour_window they agreed
0	to avoid .
0	courier fails to turn_up the next_day as agreed .
0	argos refuse to accept any blame , refuses to refund the item until they have collected it and refuse to compensate for the fact that my wife has taken an additional day holiday from work .
0	e_- mail sent to argos asking for an immediate_response .
0	argos then send another courier on the wrong day to the wrong_address .
0	' customer service ' agent then advises that she cannot arrange a response to my e_- mail as she does not work for that department and cannot possibly speak to that department , i will just have to wait !
0	still no refund , still not collection and still no response from argos over the catalogue of errors they have caused !
0	i have now e_- mailed the ceo directly in the hope of receiving some form of resolution ; here '_s hoping !
0	i will never , ever purchase another item from argos ever again and i would strongly_recommend that you do the same !
0	if you ever feel like purchasing an item online , do yourself a favour and try amazon !
0	love using supplement_warehouse .
0	you will not find a cheaper place online for supplements .
0	they also let you pack your shopping_cart with freebies before you check out !
0	great place , i don_'_t shop anywhere_else .
0	i would strongly_recommend temptations_direct .
0	i have brought several items from them and would highly_reccommend them to others .
0	i have had no_hassle with any product or service from them and the speed from transaction to delivery are very quick ( excluding postage system ).
0	a fantastic company to buy from .
0	i am very pleased with my server & the pc i have had from them in the past .
0	even_though i had many issuses with the technical side , all the issuses have been resolved with great communication and to a high_standard .
0	i have used lots of companies before , but card team are the best .
0	i phoned 0 times and was made to feel_welcome , adrian ( the boss ) is the best in the business .
0	i can '_t fault this company , my first order arrived very quickly .
0	i previously ordered with chaoscards but they won_'_t be used again , i highly_recommend card team .
0	came_across this site randomly on google .
0	and glad i did , a no agg service .
0	couriers come to you , bid on the job , and you choose who you want to use .
0	simple
0	i have recently just purchased my v festival ticket from double0tickets and was very pleased with the price of the ticket ( cheaper_than face value !)
0	considering they are sold out pretty_much every where else and other_websites / people are selling for a lot of money .
0	next_day delivery and great service , couldn_'_t be more satisfied !
0	always check this site out if you cant find tickets for any event anywhere_else , as you can almost guarantee they will be for sale here , and you don_'_t have the worry that the tickets may be fake or not be sent at all .
0	double0tickets is a highly trusted website !
0	i have bought tickets from here for a few gigs and have always been very very happy with everything !
0	thanks doubl0tickets , i will be purchasing more tickets soon !
0	tom jewell
0	most trust_worthy site i have bought anything off and codes are emailed to you within 00_mins giving you instant service .

0	im having a ' superheroes & villians ' fancy_dress themed 00st_birthday_party very soon & being the party host i wanted to stand out from the crowd , i have been looking around for a ' mr incredible ' costume & allfancydress . com was the cheapest place around for the same costume advertised on the internet , the pictures however do it no justice at all !, the costume is awesome !
0	!, very comfortable , great quality & once tried on looks amazing !, the service was fantastic , so helpful & the delivery is really quick , even if your in a hurry they ' re always prepared to get your order to you asap !, i honestly cannot wait for the party now as it really will be incredible !, thanks allfancydress . com !
0	had all the products i needed in stock , made a very small error that would easily be done .
0	i ordered some trumpers saddle wood shaving_soap and they sent me shaving_cream by_accident , the packaging and everything is exactly the same on these two products and would easily be done if you had lots of orders to pick .
0	i called them when i received my order , the sent me the correct product straight_away by express delivery and when asking where to return the first product bearing in mind it '_s value is around £_00 they said don_'_t worry keep it .
0	this was unexpected and very kind .
0	thanks again and i will be sure to always get my man stuff from you guys .
0	cheers ,

0	ive bought two systems from wired0fire one being the very top end hellfire extreme which we up specced a little and has given a few_years of absolute fault free use and inside is absolutely immaculate in the way its built .
0	we also bought a mid range gaming system for my brother which he_loves .
0	we had an issue with our monitor minimising and freezing things ( wired0fire did not supply the monitor )
0	the guys down there were always on the phone and even took our system back to try and help us from their end as we don_'_t really know what were doing .
0	in the end they sorted everything for us , and it was all good will on their part .
0	top blokes all_round would certainly recommend .
0	we will be buying from them again .
0	i always go there for my fish , they have experienced staff there , if one of them isnt too sure he '_ll go get the ' fish expert ' always gives good advice of which fish can go with what .
0	they have ordered me fish in when they dont stock them .
0	guisley chain
0	traxxas is the best manufacture of rc_cars by far !
0	waterproof electronics .. no other company offers that !
0	good rang of items .. was about to purchase some speakers for my car when the staff recommend a differnet brand the same spec but cheaper .. can '_t complain .
0	this was the guisley chain .
0	well as per_title .. its good but for the extra money i don_'_t see the difference really .
0	rather save_money for the same product .

0	when the man came to my door he was very polite and well manored .
0	couldn_'_t ask for any more really .
0	excellent !
0	well where to start ..?
0	rang up modelsport and spoke to a very polite young_man who helped_me place my order on monday for a hpi trophy as this was my first nirto car i wanted to ask a few questions , after_speaking a other model shops i was a little hesitent to ask as questions as they seem to just try get you off the phone , but eith ms they took the time to explain the in '_s and outs of the hobby !
0	they gave_me alot of confidence and tips and tricks for propper use and maintenance .
0	never had this much care and attention from any where !
0	not to mention the delivery times .. next_day !
0	i got a email from them with all tracking_information , tracked my parcel on line ( link in the email ) it gave_me a hour time window which worked_fine for me as i had to pop out !
0	astonishing service !
0	very simple , fast and easy ... no_messing_around when it came to the payment , just pure gold .
0	would recommend to everyone .
0	after_searching sites for days i found supplementwarehouse . com and it was the best deal all across the board .
0	plus the free_samples , shakers , and pill containers are an added_bonus !
0	highly_recommended !
0	cmpo are very good at what they do they supply fantastic items of a high_quality i ordered my throttle cable from them for my ajs no_problems_whatsoever apart_from the courier service who have done nothing but mess both me and cmpo around i emailed cmpo due to the fact my cable never arrived as promised from ukmail on the saturday which cost me extra and i must_say matthew squire who emailed me back has_been fantastic he refunded the delivery charge and has_been monitoring where my parcel is the service and the company as a whole are second to none and matthew squire is a ledgend of a man so i would like to say a big thank_you to them , but i would advise to stay_away from ukmail
0	i ordered a throttle cable from a site for my motorbike that i needed so i could get into work and paid £_00 for a saturday delivery because it was desperate .
0	i then received a text at 00 . 00 saturday_morning saying it had been resheduled for monday delivery so i phoned uk mail and explained my situation they told me it had been diverted and the girl on the phone really coudnt care , when i askdd about compensation or a partial_refund i was basically told go away .
0	this company is an_absolute_joke i will never be using there services again and i recommend no one elese ever does
0	all in all the whole day was fantastic , they made the day very easy to pay for and keep track of where everyone was up to .
0	the day out was brilliant , quality and we had very few problems .
0	would recommend to anyone in the future planning something like a stag_do .
0	heres my story ...!
0	ordered 0 big_boys via_groupon 0 / 00 / 00 ... got fed_up of waiting and cancelled 0 / 0 / 00 .
0	got money back off groupon no_probs but still_waiting for carriage refund from infurn .
0	was supposed to be refunded automatically 0 / 0 / 00 ... nothing .
0	chased sonya 00 / 0 / 00 and was told it would be done within the week ... nothing ... chasing again now , no response to emails and calls going straight to answer phone !
0	the saga_continues ...
0	ordered saturday and received tues_morning .
0	excellent communication_throughout , very pleasant_transaction .
0	and the lolly was a nice_touch :)
0	unfortunately upon_arrival at the airport it was almost 0 hours before our shared shuttle took off .
0	this resulted_in a significant delay over the quoted arrival time and the villa owners we were meeting had to wait_until the middle of the night to meet us with the keys .
0	further stress was seen when we found we couldn_'_t be dropped_off anywhere close to the place we booked the travel to ( i had to get a taxi at additional_cost ), there was plenty time for resorthoppa to get in touch with us on this .
0	finally finding out our pickup time proved almost_impossible as it never got put up on the website and after me finally phoning them ( at significant cost to me ) i got it sorted_out with them , however the representative was rather snippy .
0	next time i would be booking a private shuttle , however i would still use resorthoppa .
0	i recently_purchased a bluetooth_headset from this company .
0	not only they offered the cheapest price , but i also received the item the next working day , though i chose the slowest delivery option .
0	i cannot_praise thomas_cook holidays enough !
0	their direct flights to antalya are so very convenient and you always get a good deal , with no_hidden_charges on their website .
0	the staff is always friendly and helpful .
0	i flew to turkey with ba before_christmas .
0	the plane took off on time and my journey was a pleasant_experience in overall .
0	excellent reception everywhere in uk , great prices on pay as you go .
0	i ordered a laptop with this company and received a confirmation of my order .
0	i paid for next_day delivery and waited all day at home .
0	it didn_'_t arrive .
0	i e_- mailed the customer service next_day to enquire and they told me that they have cancelled my order .
0	my bank informs_me that the transaction has_been made and not reversed .
0	so i paid for a computer , never received it and they did not even care to let_me know about the situation .
0	i hope to get my bank to sort this out .
0	i would not recommend this company to anyone and i started to believe that some of the the 0_star reviews are not genuine .
0	how can a company get either completely terrible or absolutely fantastic reviews ?
0	well tesco home delivery shopping .
0	i can '_t complain i use it every week .
0	its quick very easy to use and best of all you can even change your order up untill a set time which can be on the day of delivery .

0	excellent service and great website :)
0	simple shopping_experience from a reliable_source .

0	i '_ve been with quidco 0 years_now and had about £ 0000 in cleared_funds_transferred_into my bank_account based on various purchases , such as car insurance (£_00 ), window blinds (£ 0 . 00 ), luggage bags (£ 0 . 00 ), phone contracts (£_00 ), sim only contracts (£_000 ), airport_parking (£ 0 ), car tyres (£_00 ), plus net internet (£_000 )
0	it '_s always worth_checking with literally any internet purchase .
0	most of these purchases i would have made anyway so it really is just extra cash .
0	some people don_'_t get why companies would pay you this extra cash , i usually just compare it to the advertising money google would get if you clicked a link after_googling something and making a purchase after clicking a google link , or for the really un - initiated compare it to the aa breakdown_cover man that stands in the street selling you cover for £_000 ( he would get £_00 commission ).
0	this is the money you too are entitled to ( through_quidco )!
0	service , products & delivery are always great .
0	no unpleasant_surprises , generous offer , speedy payment
0	i have been preparing to start a game development project for some time and needed a high_spec laptop that would keep me happy for a few_years .
0	i would have gone for a desktop but that is simply not viable with my current living arrangements .
0	i literally spent months weighing things up before_settling on pc_specialist .
0	i went with them because they offered the best price , best build quality and best service , which i deduced from many , many online reviews of all categories as well as word of mouth .
0	my place of work had ordered an optimus for me in recent months and that is still serving me very well .
0	i wanted something that would be comfortable to use , not too flashy or juvenile looking and that i could spec quite highly , so i settled on the vortex .
0	the service was incredibly fast and very professional .
0	i called them to make queries about delivery and part availability and was given prompt and accurate responses .
0	i have seen friends get burned through dell , msi and asus and wanted to avoid that kind of experience at all costs .
0	with pc_specialist , i got my wish .
0	the machine is amazing - super quick and very powerful , nothing has made it protest or struggle yet .
0	it has a top end i0 , a 0gb 000m and a 000gb_ssd and 00gb_ram , so it shouldn_'_t .
0	i am installing a whole bunch of 0d modelling and animation software tonight and i expect them to run very well indeed .
0	honestly , my brother in law , an architect , has just ordered a vortex for himself after_seeing what i got .
0	i would insist that anyone i knew should buy from pc_specialist because i am happy to stake my reputation on theirs .
0	for top end laptops , i recommend them without_hesitation or reservation .
0	ordered a few games from cjs now and every time is has_been brilliant .
0	extremely competitive_prices even compared to going direct to places like steam .
0	purchasing is so quick from clicking the one you want to buying it is just a few_clicks and the keys are delivered immediately .
0	even at 0 :_00pm !
0	cjs is very quickly becoming my go to for digitally buying games .
0	if your considering buying a fancy outfit for a party or just for fun use the same place i got mine from escapade , real brill service and quality_merchandise , i won_'_t be using anybody_else now i '_ve found these_guys
0	i recently ordered a giant talon 0 from the cycle centre , what can i say , delivery rapid , customer service unbelievable , very helpful , couldn_'_t of felt more at home , i will always recommend them to any body wanting a bike whether it be road , mtb or any other bike out there !
0	0st_class company couldn_'_t have asked for more ordering on line was so easy and paypal accepted answell and i loved how i kept getting funny updates on there progress . 00 / 00 on every_aspect of the transaction 00 / 00 would recommend to anyone
0	these are the most reliable company on the web for supplements on the web but also keeping the lowest_prices on the market .
0	excellent service and super_fast delivery , highly_recommended !!
0	a ++++++++++
0	i placed my order on wednesday_evening and by friday_morning i was walking around with my very own personalized hoodie !
0	great service and i will_definitely use them again !
0	the website was really easy and helpful .
0	it took literally minutes to sell my old phone and 0 day after a weekend to receive the return pack .
0	will_definately_use this service again in the future and will recommend this site to anyone who is selling an old_mobile_phone .
0	really impressed with their service since we started_using them initially on a trial basis 00 months_ago .
0	since that time we have taken on their services on a long_term basis and also seamlessly expanded the services we had set_up with them initially .
0	full of knowledgeable people who provide a helpful courteous service , particularly our account_manager who has_been integral in all discussions since initial_contact .
0	irfan ( conrad uk )
0	very good initial sales support over the phone and the operator knew his stuff and didn_'_t try to upsell to a more_expensive model of iem given these were a present for my sister .
0	ordered using royal_mail 0st_class delivery and it came 0 working day later .
0	this was especially impressive considering all the disruption caused_by the heavy_snow , but most_importantly well_done for hifiheadphones getting the order out within a few hours on the same day .
0	website is also aesthetically_pleasing and joy to use .
0	will use again when i undoubteldy upgrade any of my cans or buy others presents .
0	i was really impressed , this was my first time using supplementwarehouse . com and they instantly beat a competitors lower price by 0 %!!
0	i saved over twenty dollars on one item alone .
0	plus loads of free_samples and a free_shaker which is always a plus !
0	thanks guys , be back soon !!
0	!
0	there truly are no words to describe what and awful and misleading company simply_electronics is .
0	i ordered a camera from them due to their advertising of having two in stock as well as free shipping for 0 - 0 business days .
0	needless to say the camera did not get shipped out until 0 days after the camera was purchased and it was being shipped from_hong_kong !!
0	the camera didn_'_t even arrive at my home address until 0_weeks after it was originally ordered , and i had already left the country to go traveling .
0	so , i then had to have it shipped to where i was traveling to for another fifty dollars for which i have not been reimbursed .
0	customer service was absolutely_useless as all of their employees are outsourced and speak very poor english .
0	when trying to email them i got very vague responses from random first name only " customer service executives ".
0	none of which had any sort of tracking_number .
0	i must of emailed them about 0 times , each time getting a reply from a random " customer service executive ".
0	how many executives can one company have ?
0	overall it was a terrible experience and i would not recommend simply_electronics to anyone .
0	that is of course , if you want to be lied to and wait around for your purchased goods .
0	amazing customer_services who went beyond the call of duty to ensure that my christmas_gifts arrived today .
0	really thrilled and they have save christmas
0	many_thanks julesb
0	friendly professional technician , brilliant service and value .
0	was shown exactly_what was done to my car and had test_drive with technican .
0	this unlocked the true potential on my 00 focus st . higher boost , 00 hp & 000 nm .
0	more responsive enjoyable drive .
0	have already_recommended to friends .
0	top job quantum
0	so we booked a stag through chilli_sauce who organised what we wanted .
0	we arrived at brighton mid_morning and the hotel wasn_'_t far from the station which was ideal .
0	from dropping our bags off at the hotel ( check in not unitll 0 ) we caught a taxi to go - karting .
0	it was indoor go - karting and i would highly_recommend this .
0	was a great time and competitive amongst us competitive alpha males .
0	the hotel was very nice overall and pleasant place to stay .
0	just few minor_hiccups .
0	the bar service was very slow , sat there for a bout 0 - 00mins till we got served , just fancied quick pint before we went out .
0	secondly breakfast , 0 of us out of 0 weren_'_t actually served or asked what we wanted to eat unlike every other guest around us and the 0 other people in our party .
0	apart_from that all good on this front .
0	the nightlife of brighton is amazing .
0	the best i have been to by far , friends who have previously been raved_about it , now i see why .
0	we had vip for several clubs which was cool .
0	went to most and had a really good time .
0	overall the weekend was really good and really enjoyed it .
0	would recommend especially as chillisauce sorted it for us so you didn_'_t have to be worrying the whole time , you get to enjoy the weekend .
0	thanks chilli_sauce and olivia !
0	i wanted a tank bag for when i go touring to hold the essentials which i will need quickly .
0	however with my bike it was a task to find a bag which suited my bike due to the mix of materials on the tank .
0	i exchanged an email with the customer serivces and they assured me that the bag can be exchanged or refunded if it didn_'_t fit my bike .
0	this reassured me so i went_ahead with the purchase .
0	fortunately the bag fits_perfectly .
0	overall really quick response to my email and the product was delivery in exceptional time too .
0	definetly recommend to others , big_thumbs_up !
0	after moving to our new house and saving for over a year to purchase a dining_table that we intend to be a major part of our home for the next 00 - 00 years i must_say i am utterly_disgusted with the service your company has given us !
0	we visited your immaculate store on numerous_occasions and were given a great service ( obviously because you want the sale ) and decided to eventually order through your website .
0	when the payment failed online we gave your customer service team a call where they were extremely_helpful and all so happy to help solve our issue ( again to get our sale ).
0	we parted with over £ 0000 and decided to go for the express delivery at the extra_cost of £_00 to speed the process up .
0	so it seems we have had great service , does it not ?
0	?
0	well let ’_s fast forward a week_later when we received our brand_new table …..
0	upon_opening and assembling the table we noticed a knock on the corner of the table so we thought “ ok it ’_s not a problem i ’ ll ring them and i ’_m_sure they will be able to solve the problem ”.
0	after providing pictures of the damage and calling your support_team a number of times ( i think the extra_charges on my bill are now around the £_00 mark ) i get a call back from one of your customer_support managers and i ’_m told don_’_t worry we will send out a company to repair the damage , now correct me if i ’_m wrong but when you buy a new table you don_’_t expect to be told that it will be repaired , so when i told the guy that ’_s not good enough and i want the new table i paid for he says “ this isn_'_t company policy ” so i tell him i want a refund and he replies with these exact words “ you can have a refund but you are not welcome to order with us again ” ( oak_furniture_land , if you don_’_t believe this please check your recordings ).
0	as you can_imagine i ’_m a little annoyed at this stage and tell him il ring back .
0	after some deliberation and to cut an extremely long_story_short we thought we would see what the repair looked like and take it from there .
0	oak_furniture_land employ a company called homeserve to assess and “ repair ” the damage and the joiner touches it up , doesn_'_t varnish the “ repair ” the same colour as the rest and we are still left with the worry that if the corner was to take a knock it could easily fall away .
0	the homeserve joiner also made the comment that it ’_s not perfect .
0	at this point i ’_m thinking that the homeserve joiners report and pictures will prove the point and we will be provided with a new table .
0	after three_days i ’_m finally contacted to be told that the repair looks fine , they won_’_t be offering a replacement or compensation and that if i want i can have a refund .
0	to be honest i don_’_t want a refund i want this table that we paid £ 0000 for and spent countless hours researching and deciding to buy .
0	i can ’_t believe that such a big company like this would have this sort of attitude_towards customers who are willing to hand over their money .
0	i may expect it from an ebay_seller …. oh wait you were once an ebay_seller and because director [_name_] has worked so hard , has built up an empire that allows him to treat people like this and because he is bringing in such large_amounts of money doesn_'_t care that some customer will be unhappy and they can shop somewhere_else !
0	as with any service i ’_m_sure there are 0000 '_s of happy customers and i can see why they would be happy as you do offer great pieces of furniture .
0	but the level of service we have since received has made us extremely unhappy and i will be making_sure i can tell as many people as possible never to shop at oak_furniture_land .
0	i ’_m not one to make complaints in public and would much rather deal with a company to resolve any_problems i have , but i feel this is completely_unacceptable when you want the item you have paid for but are being told you can ’_t have it .
0	****_update *****
0	sorry this has taken so long to reply to but after a number of calls and a lengthy rant on facebook followed_by loads of friends jumping on the band wagon oak_furniture_land finally offered me a compensation deal on my damaged table .
0	i guess it helps and the customer service i have since been offered was great but i wont be updating my score rating or above review as i really wouldn_'_t have expected the initial after service they offered .
0	****_update *****
0	great website and super_fast delivery , will_definitely be ordering again with them and will be recommending to friends !
0	!
0	first of all , i would like to say , don_'_t count on that if you buy one of their t - shirts with customized logo / design / wording , that it will be a high_quality t - shirt .
0	the one you are going to get is the fruit of the loom t - shirt , currently costs £ 0 . 00 on amazon .
0	these are the cheapest of the cheapest you can get , and yet , they will charge you £_00 if you want customized logo on this .
0	this and the fact that the t - shirt they sent us was far too small , and did not match the size they mention on the size_charts on their websites , influenced my decision to return it and use their guarantee to get the money back if you are not fully_satisfied .
0	it was 0_weeks_ago when we called them numerous_times asking for a refund .
0	no money was returned and when we called them back again , they told us we need to wait further 0 days !
0	stay_away from these incompetent people , they will send you the cheapest product that is available on the market and if you are not happy , you will wait weeks and weeks for them to fulfill their customer_satisfaction_guarantee .
0	we have not got our money back after 0_weeks and i don_'_t know if we ever will .
0	generally a good experience , the items all arrived and i paid much less_than if i had bought things at a supermarket .
0	the delivery wasn_'_t up to scratch however : i ordered on a thursday_evening and expected everything to arrive on the monday as next_day delivery is advertised , however when i called on monday it turned_out that it hadn_'_t been sent , i got an_apology but no explanation .
0	i got the order on tuesday but had to wait in all day for it , another company i order from uses_dpd and is able to give me a one hour delivery slot , dpd offers this service to their customers for free so it would make_sense for sushisushi to make use of it and keep their customers happier .
0	i was also given no tracking_number with my delivery confirmation_email , simple things can mean the difference_between repeat_custom and looking for better service elsewhere .
0	i initially placed an order with 0gon but as i wanted to ship to my business address i held back after their security policy flagged my order would need to be shipped to my billing_address .
0	after a short email exchange with their support_team they informed me if i placed my order they would happily ship it to my works address , result 0 .
0	i then completed the order and was informed it would arrive in 0 working_days ( this would just be in time for me ) as i was too late for that days shipment , result 0 .
0	however i then got another email back saying they managed to get the unit shipped and the delivery was now in 0 working day , result 0 !
0	so for not so much time i went from not placing an order to having it placed and the item being shipped for the next_day delivery .
0	fantastic !
0	i '_ve_used blackcircles many_times now and i '_ve never had an issue .
0	again blackcircles were cheaper_than anyone_else for the tyres i had in mind .
0	i also bought tyres which were mercedes approved ( i don_'_t own a mercedes ) which prompted a call from the support_team to let_me know this was not an issue and the tyres marking may indicate mo for mercedes .
0	i also had to contact blackcircles to change my appointment time , again no_fuss and a confirmation_email was received within a short_space of time .
0	what else could you ask for ?
0	great prices , super_fast despatch and next_day delivery .
0	simply put if you want computer games this is the only site you need .
0	first time i have used this service and my key was with me in less_than 0 minute from when my purchase was made .
0	very very impressive !
0	theres not many companies around at the moment that make such an effort , great comuncations everystep of the way , items were well_packed and in good condition ( this is becoming less and less with other couriers ! )
0	will certainley be using again , ffx keep_up this standard and you will have many loyal_customers .
0	ordered standard delivery , c my first order hope other orders are the same .
0	i have looked in every store varying from gnc to complete nutrition to the local_stores ex health nuts .
0	i have also looked online and my results are the same .
0	every place i look places are charging more than supplementwarehouse . com
0	thanks again guys !
0	some issues with royal_mail , but you got these here fast !
0	i spent £_00 , but looking at everything i got you would have thought i ' d spent well over £_000 !
0	see you soon ;)
0	0 months in to my 0 contract , i find myself with the same problem every_month .
0	i keep trying to change my bill cycle to coincide with payday , and every_month i '_m told it '_s done , i still get cut_off mid - month .
0	this month , they refuse to acknowledge this has even happened and won_'_t reconnect me even_though i use the phone for work , and checking on my heavily pregnant_girlfriend .
0	the manager " hannand ?"
0	is incredibly_rude and unsympathetic , see you in court .
0	i am very pleased with the service that i received from dino_pc .
0	i was able to send a few email questions about my purchase of a gallant amd 0000 , and got instant responses every time .
0	the pc itself is perfect for gaming , i was able to customize to my liking for a reasonably cheap price compared to elsewhere .
0	i would recommend to anyone looking for custom made pc '_s and will be coming_back if i ever need a new pc .
0	yodel deserves a minus star_ratings
0	i live in london and i ordered a laptop through this courier service using a special diamond care package ( mon - fri pre_- 00am ).
0	i followed their service progress through their website and waited for my package to arrive from 0am .
0	to my annoyance , i rang them up to check on the delivery .
0	and the customer advisor was adamant that the delivery would be made in time and if not they will leave a " we just missed you " card .
0	i got none of them .
0	what really annoyed me was the fact that they made no attempt to deliver my parcel and that there clearly was no communication between the yodel depot center and their drivers .
0	the lack of awareness and the lack of care shown by the yodel customer advisors are the least problematic in their rogue delivery system .
0	the whole_procedure was so inefficient .
0	i went to the yodel depot center to collect the parcel myself on the same day .
0	although the people who work at the depot can not be blamed for the inconvenience , they didn_'_t exactly help the situation get any better either .
0	i tried_phoning the depot earlier to check on the whereabouts of my parcel , but no - one answered my calls .
0	and when i arrived at the depot , i understood why .
0	the people who work their seems nice and friendly .
0	however when their phones rang , they all turned a blind eye to a customer '_s call .
0	and they even joked about it afterwards , branding them " silly people ".
0	i was made to wait for an_hour in front of the reception .
0	when they then told me i had to come_back the next_day , because their driver would not return after 0pm and that their depot center closes at 0pm .
0	i am still angry to this day when someone mentions the delivery courier , yodel .
0	the lack of care shown by their entire company is mind - boggling .
0	how could a delivery company who say they are one of the best in the business be so wrong , inefficient and ignorant .
0	if yodel were to do a review of their own service , they really should check on their depots / drivers .
0	the communication between drivers and their headquarters .
0	possibly re - educating the customer advisors that they should be working for their customers to their upmost ability and also be happy and proud to be working for their company .
0	i ordered a hosting_package that didn_'_t fully support the . net framework , some of the features were blocked and this wasn_'_t explained on the website .
0	customer_services refused to void the contract saying that i had signed_up through a special_offer on their website so there was no way to void it .
0	the only way to sign up was through the offer !!
0	!
0	please don_'_t make the mistake of using them .
0	tagadab . com have been brilliant , try them out .
0	can '_t fault the service , they have never_let_me down !
0	product always arrives before or on the release_date .
0	good prices as well , what '_s not to like ?
0	!
0	really bad_experience .
0	i bought a laptop off them 00 days ago and they sent me the wrong product .
0	i phoned them and they told me i was in a queue and my return would be processed in order of the queue .
0	0 days_later they reply and say they will pickup the product , by this time the birthday i bought the present for has_been and gone .
0	day of waiting and the courier doesn_'_t come so i have to phone again and reorganise .
0	they claim they didn_'_t get the email even_though i replied and sent it to their customer_services .
0	the wrong laptop finally returned they call me to say the listing was a mistake on their website and i would have to pay extra to get the product i ordered !
0	!
0	birthday missed , can '_t return the accessories i bought from another company as its passed the return period and the company will only offer me a refund .
0	oh by that way that takes three_days .
0	avoid like the plague !
0	jstyla was very professional in his approach to both the design and implementation of our new website .
0	he took time to make_sure everything was fitting to the company image , looked at our goals for the future and designed accordingly .
0	there were a lot of meetings in which we could pass around ideas and feedback was taken on board for every small detail making_sure we were satisfied the whole way through .
0	good communication and quick to resolve any_issues that arise .
0	would use jstyla every time and would recommend to anyone who needs a new site , who needs graphic_design work or a company re - branding .
0	a pleasure to deal with this company .
0	i was given sound_advice on what to purchase , informed on pro '_s and con '_s of each system i was looking at .
0	ordered over the phone on tuesday , received a call on tuesday_afternoon to say my goods had been dispatched and goods arrived wednesday !
0	i even got a call a couple of days_later to check i had set everything up correctly and to see if i needed any further help !
0	i cannot recommend this retailer enough .
0	look_forward to my next purchase with you guys .
0	so digitalrev have given me a canon_00d at £_000 cheaper_than the uk price and around £_000 cheaper_than the newer 00d which is not hugely different .
0	cant thank them enough .
0	dhl messed_around with the delivery but still received item less_than a week after purchase ( and would have been 0 days quicker had it not been for dhl in the uk ).
0	love the fact that the item came with an adaptor to charge the battery in the uk and the only_negative is an instruction back in chinese .
0	however love the touch of adding the website to download one in english .
0	havent properly used the item yet but from first appearances and a few photos taken very happy so_far .
0	complete_joke
0	i have read through other reviews and was not surprised to see loads of issues
0	upon attempting to purchase an item for £_00 . 00 a prompt was displayed
0	' there was a problem with your payment and your order has not yet been placed .
0	please check your details and try again '.
0	they still took £_000 . 00 from the 0 failed_attempts
0	after the fifth attempt customer_services were contacted , they said that the previous attempts had not gone_through , i was told to try using paypal , so ordered again using the paypal and the order was confirmed .
0	this software issue put my bank_account into arrears with the possibility of incurring charges , but for the time had left me with no money from friday 00nd_march – wednesday 00th_march , 0days including a pre_- arranged trip away over the weekend meaning no access to spending money and also not being_able to access money needed for travelling to work on the monday following the weekend .
0	was offered a ' good will gesture ' credit to the account of £_00 . 00 which meant i would have to purchase from them again to redeem the credit .
0	but due to all of this stress , even more so now , i do not see how this can be used and be confident that this will not happen again without resulting in the same situation .
0	the money final went back in today but i believe this to be there automated service taking care of this , not by the personel i had asked to help
0	i had made countless calls , 00 + were everytime i had asked for the manager to contact me , was told that my messages where being put through to the managers but i never got a reply .
0	( sorry i recieved 0 from umar but did not help at all ).
0	what was happening to my messages ??
0	why do they not reply to there customers ?
0	umar and aidan both customer_services manager provided very very poor service , i cannot_believe they can treat their customers this way .
0	i have thought about taking this further and glad to see my issues can be backed_up multiple_times by unsatisfied customers .
0	i hope this info is of use .
0	ordered 00 red_roses it is now 0000 still no delivery , i have emailed them no reply
0	i was sent a email with a link to tracking and when i went on it the number i was given didnt match any order , well thanks iflorest you take my money but dont deliver surely they carnt get away with this the least you can do is refund all of us please beware and dont use iflorist .

0	no delays , no faff , they always seem to have everything in stock , they '_ll match prices and it '_s despatched as soon as you order .
0	really good .
0	if you know your size in stuff , there '_s no need to buy anywhere_else .
0	the kit is such good quality and the service is amazing .
0	real people , interested in the stuff you do with it , it '_s more than just a shop .
0	incredible for an online_retailer .
0	we try and order rabbit litter in bulk , and so many sellers claim free delivery then add a charge over a certain weight and then adjust it by weight .
0	it '_s fair_enough , but no - one publishes the weight of the litter !
0	petshopbowl just had a flat delivery fee , which is terrific as you can quickly work out the cost per bag rather_than faffing with lots of maths .
0	i '_ll definitely use them again .
0	really nice_touch to ask for your_pets ' names for your registration , after all it '_s them we buy things for !
0	nice for a pet company to recognise the fact .
0	well , it was really perfect .
0	being a commodore amiga , a very delicade item , cash did a very good job when it comes to packaging .
0	thank_you
0	bought x : rebirth , price cheaper_than other_sites .
0	as it was first order i assume delivery speed was slowed slightly .
0	cdkey came after about 00_minutes activated fine on steam .
0	will try again in future
0	wow !
0	had my package in less_than 00_hours of ordering .
0	very impressive .
0	will_definitely be back for anything_else i want .
0	i would just like to say how happy i am with your level of service .
0	it is so nice to know that prompt service is not dead .
0	if i used phone insurance i would have been looking at a 0 week turnaround at_least and for less_than double the amount of money i get a fully refurbished phone in 0 days !
0	i will be recommending youselves to my friends .
0	never had any_problems , and they '_ve always been cheaper_than the usual_sources .
0	no issues at all , delivered as promised .
0	ordered from here during my entire deployment , everything got over_seas on time and is only of the only online places that ship to the military over_seas
0	as a huge football / soccer fan , being_able to watch games all weekend is my " thing ".
0	it '_s what i do , so when my tv continued to act up i decided that enough was enough - i won_'_t miss another steven gerrard penalty again .
0	i phoned some of the local companies to find a cost - effective strategy - hey , moneys tight - and chose to use aerialforce because they offered a fair price , and had available slots before the southampton match .
0	the high_winds are driving me to distraction so it was nice to be able to just get in and watch the match without constant freezing .
0	the guys at aerialforce were here 0 minutes before they said they would be and were away not long after .
0	i '_ve yet to suffer from a " buffering " sensation on the tv since .
0	quality work , cheers_lads .
0	the amount of excellent offers on display made me come to actually view the site properly .
0	i ' d heard of winner through a friend but wanted to visit it myself and see what i made of it .
0	i instantly got a few brilliant startup offers , and this was a nice little bonus .
0	these additions are well_worth having on your end , for sure , they make your gambling much_cheaper , right ?
0	the entire site is simple to manage , though .
0	no_problems here on my part - it '_s quick , it '_s easy and it '_s got a hell of a lot different features and styles of gambling available .
0	i '_ll be back to use winner in the future !
0	having spent pretty_much all of my time in recent years trying to create my own income it '_s been very frustrating .
0	however , i decided to fire off my cv / resume onto jobs0careers and it '_s been one of the smartest decisions i '_ve made in some time .
0	i have used the engine a few_times now when looking for jobs and it '_s not the usual commission or sales based junk you usually get - i actually got myself some service contracts through the search_engine .
0	i recommended it to a few friends and one of them found a full - time job with a local warehouse company in glasgow , the other two found temporary solutions which is all they were after , so i think it '_s fair to say jobs0careers has given me and my friends all of the help we needed in terms of finding new employment and making some money !
0	i ' d_happily_recommend this website to just about anybody who needs a job , whether they are unemployed or are looking for a new direction .
0	the list is huge , the site is so easy to navigate and the companies are reliable and trustworthy firms rather_than your fly by night call_centres .
0	today i was making some work enquirers to parcel0go via the web chat .
0	i was chatting to [_name_]
0	[_name_] was great and helpful .
0	i think she may be the one !
0	i '_m in love with her ....

0	then all my stuff went active was very happy every thing was cool 0_weeks latta in november all my services went off with a fault on the line since then my internet and tv has not worked correctly this is now march_0000 , iv called customer service up 00 times every time they hanged up on me and then il have to call up .. they sent out tv engineers who all they did was a factory_reset on the box wast of time 0 new reuters still net don_'_t work correctly .
0	then n the 00th of march_0000 i called up as my enginer arived and then refused to fix my fualt and went home i called up was todl i can cancel for free as my serice as not worked fro a wile agnet on phone was so rude he said how about i shut up and listen to him hes the talktalk agent and i have to do as he says so i hung_up called bk spoke with manger old them what happened was tald to call bk on the 0th i did they refused to put me on to cancellations department i prosted til i was put on to a manger from cancellations who so happened to be english and from uk at last she understood and no questions let_me leave my contract for free at last .
0	iv now said to my wife and my friends im now and forever will be avoiding talktalk car - phone were house company '_s all seem to rip you off so avoid them all as much as you can .. so really all i can say is avoid them unless u want stress and pay for stuff that you don_'_t get

0	having read_reviews on which socks offered the best protection_against blisters when playing basketball , thorlo running socks came up as a good option .
0	sock shop had a great range of styles and colours available , i order wednesday_afternoon and had them first thing thursday_morning .

0	we inherited an adt alarm_system when we took over a retail business , in the past 0 years we '_ve had no end of trouble with the cheap alarm_system they installed , a total_lack of customer service and engineers that contradict each other and blame anything but the shoddy alarm_system they use .
0	despite_numerous engineers being called out over the years our alarm regularly displays error messages and signals false alarms .
0	adt have a habit of over billing , for instance our last call out was due to a technical fault , it took the engineer 0 minutes to identify the problems and 00_minutes to ' fix '.
0	the invoice came through stating that he ' d been here 0 . 00_hours and that it was due to an intruder alert so the work was chargeable .
0	adt = scam !
0	do not use .
0	avoid .
0	000_% rip_off .
0	used william_hill for years for betting on horses and football , lost more than i '_ve won ( obviously ) but the site is really easy and simple to use .
0	tried other services but just come_back to will hill .
0	good service and platform .
0	easy to use and would use again .
0	very poor response to advert i placed from the platform , however i think has to do with the market for renting in my area rather_than rentify .
0	easiest , most efficient site out there .
0	end of story .
0	great selection .
0	fast service .
0	unbeatable prices .
0	you cant go_wrong with supplement_warehouse .
0	they have a good range of sweets , communications , delivery etc were all first_rate , my only complaint would be that the delivery charges are perhaps a little high , but not excessively so .
0	grey house furniture ltd . has_been setup on behalf of owen arthur mackrell , by his pa ben atkins .
0	owen has owned numerous companies that have been closed_down and cost many people £ 0 , 000 '_s .
0	most noticeably he was the director of mac & mac interiors ( lcc contract furniture ltd .) that was put into_liquidation and they still robbed customers of their money knowing they couldn_'_t deliver the furniture .
0	google ' mac & mac interiors ' or ' owen mackrell ' to see all of the negative_reviews , he is behind this company too but has had his pa ben atikins set the company up because he has such a bad_reputation and can no_longer do_business under his own name !
0	!
0	if you don_'_t want to lost your money i suggest you avoid this company at all costs !!
0	a leapoard never changes its spots and owen has already scammed people under at_least 0 different companies i am aware of so don_'_t expect this to be any different .
0	i have had over £_00k worth of work come from pph and had a dispute with 0 buyer who was being unreasonable .
0	as i never responded to the buyer within 00_hours they closed my account down .
0	i have tried_contacting their support regarding this for almost 0_weeks now with no reply .
0	they expected me to respond to a dispute within 00_hours , yet havn '_t responded to my own dispute with them in almost 0 weerks - avoid !!
0	!
0	two whole months after ordering my glasses , they still_haven_'_t arrived .

0	the time i got through the person i spoke to said he ' d go over to the warehouse / lab and find out why my glasses haven_'_t been dispatched and then phone me back .
0	he never phoned me back , his_name was michael
0	to put my experience into context , i have never felt the need to leave a review for a website before and i '_ve had some pretty poor experiences in the past .
0	.
0	worst company ever , they have not delivered my item for 00 days now .
0	it may be cheap but most definitely the delivery is awful .
0	i think the delivery men left it in front of my house and legged it .
0	absolutely_terrible .
0	as internet user , i usually have doubt against online shop that aren_'_t well know for what they do .
0	i tried cartridgeshop . co . uk and bought a brother ink catridge just because they support payment via_paypal .
0	i was not disappointed .
0	thanks .
0	order arrived within 00_hours .
0	very happy !

0	the " live_chat " service has never been online when i have attempted to us it .
0	i have not had a single response to any of the ten emails i have written .
0	all in all the worst service from any company i have ever received .

0	had no trouble to get the keys and the rest of instructions .
0	i '_ll be back again soon !
0	fast and reliable keep it up

0	excellent advice , brilliant delivery and service .
0	great offers and rewards_scheme plus huge choices .
0	never had a bad_experience and the staff are always helpful .
0	have no_hesitation in recommending affordable_supplements to everyone .
0	hassle - free , speedy delivery of product .
0	would recommend to anyone .
0	great service , and great prices all_round .
0	a friend recommended me to the site and the first thing i found was a pleasant layout , very user_friendly .
0	i have never spent so much money on one thing in my pc but my friend recommended that the money i had i should buy a gainward gtx_000 ti gold sample .
0	luckily they were on sale .
0	i put down the order using paypal which as anyone who_uses paypal knows is quick and very painless .
0	i paid the extra postage for guaranteed next_day delivery .
0	a lovely city_link man arrived and with parcel in hand assured i was happy before leaving .
0	i must_admit i will be recommending aria to all my other friends .
0	i love this company , the prices are almost always superior to all other offers , and the fact that they give express delivery at a very low price is fantastic , i have had no_complaints
0	i found hostelbookers to be the simplest of the several online reservation sites to use .
0	the distance from city_centre feature was incredibly useful as was the many options to filter search_results .
0	also many reviews of all hostels i looked at so i could choose where to stay based on what others had recommended .
0	i have shopped at plenty of places on and offline .
0	most brick and mortars don_'_t have the selection or variety .
0	in addition , the prices are often jacked up because of the overhead cost , and commision to the sale associates that work in these places .
0	furthermore , you often need a paid membership to see any sort of discount .
0	the online arena is a bit better , but most online merchants don_'_t have a direct source to get the best prices .
0	therefore , you still end up paying for a product that probably been sold 0 - 0 times before it reaches your hand .
0	also , the shipping rates for a lot of these products are outrageous .
0	this is why you should shop at supplementwarehouse . com .
0	they have best pricing that i have seen online and offline , and you can '_t beat the limited time 0 . 00 flat shipping .
0	i have been ordering from the site for the past couple of years and i haven_'_t been disappointed yet .
0	went online to check it out one day ..... 0 days_later i received a cheque .... top stuff !
0	hostelbookers was extremely user firendly .
0	it listed all the hostels available as well as provided comprehensive info and reviews there are also no charges for booking , which you get with other_sites .
0	i will_definitly be using hostelbookers again !
0	have tried other_companies and always come_back to top_dollar , unlike_other_companies they are fast , honest and reliable .
0	would highly_recommend
0	sent them phones which they said were faulty and offered me next to nothing for , then charged me £_00 to return them to me .
0	i have used [_external_reference_removed_] and [_external_reference_removed_] and never had this problem before , will never use bozowi again !!!
0	avoid at all costs !!!
0	!
0	00th_feb - have just received a letter from bozowi threatening to take me to court over my false feedback .
0	everything i said is true and i will now be taking this further !
0	reporting them to trading_standards !
0	how can people like this be allowed to trade ?
0	most unprofessional and nasty company ever !!!!!
0	!
0	so , one week now and i '_m still very very very happy with my car , really nice , fast , funny .
0	i '_ve got friends with got their cars from e_- bay new or second_hand and the are very disappointed .
0	so i do recommend nitrotek if you going to get you model , fast delivery , safe , and cheap price , you can save maybe 00 or 00 pounds at different places , but when you buy a product from a reliable place such as nitrotek you safe a lot of more money avoiding problems .
0	i recommend .
0	fast delivery , quality products , great customer service .
0	cant_ask for any more .
0	arrived in good time , well_packaged .
0	couldn_'_t fault them
0	delivered quickly with appropriate packaging .
0	checkout on website was quick and easy .
0	will use again .
0	great for little gifts for birthdays and christmas .
0	i went on event_tyres website whilst i was browsing for the cost of tyres and found that event_tyres were the cheapest for the particular tyre i wanted .
0	i booked it all online very easily to come to my work address ( which isn_'_t the easiest place to change a tyre due to parking attendants ) on 00 / 00 /_0000 and the booking was confirmed for the following_day ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) between 00am - 0pm .
0	i had a call around 00am to say they would be with me at around 00 :_00am and sure_enough they were .
0	it took just half an_hour to change both of my front tyres .
0	all i can say is that i will be using this company again in the future as they saved me messing_around trying to get out of work to get to a garage .
0	thank_you !

0	plus i bumped_into a couple of guys in there last summer who were champions in some form of surf cup and they were coming to boylo '_s for their gear , so it must be a good place to head to !
0	everything perfect !
0	deal , attention & results .
0	i have only been ordering from bbw for a couple of months now .
0	its a great and helpful website if you want to start body_building .
0	the main things when your buying bodybuilding_supplements and sports_supplements is the price and bbw prices cant be beat .
0	the other thing that is great is the free delivery .
0	end is the first place that i have found who embrace classic cult brands and new up and coming designers from all over the world , and combine this offering with superb service i only wish i could_afford more of their stuff
0	just moved_into a new build home with velux_windows but no blinds , so searched online and found loftblinds . co . uk - their website is very easy to use and i became slightly addicted to clicking_through the various blind colours so watch the animations !
0	i ordered my blinds in the morning and they were with me next_day , in under 00_hours .
0	i couldn_'_t fault the customer service , and the blinds were much_cheaper_than velux prices .
0	so much so i thought they might be cheap copies , but to my delight they were genuine items .
0	all three blinds i ordered arrived in good condition and came with fitting_instructions , their website also had a fitting video - fitting took 00_mins and they fitted the windows perfectly .
0	they look like they will last a few_years , but i '_m already thinking_about experimenting with other colours !
0	this is my favorite site to buy bulk order from since they have competitive price and they price match any other competitor online .
0	highly_recommend it !
0	the payment process was easy , the item was good quality for the price and it came 00_hours after the order was placed on standard delivery !
0	the max events day of activities was great although they decided on the day to not provide any lunch ( a bbq was described on chillisauce .)
0	we were told " no bbq today " without_any reason_why and with that we spent the rest of the day hungry .
0	people who suffer from hypoglycemia need food at regular_intervals and a venue that puts people through physical activity for a day with no proper food is irresponsible and asking for trouble .
0	we were miles_away from any shops so out of desperation i managed to get a pizza delivered but had to miss some activities to go meet the guy .
0	not a fun experience on a hangover !
0	great company , super_fast postage , amazing prices .
0	couldn_'_t ask for better service !
0	to be honest i was a little_worried_about spending £ 0000 online via hong_kong but i have to say i will_definitely use digital_rev for future orders .
0	they kept me up to date via_text and email and i was especially suprised at how fast it got here from_hong_kong .

0	site is easy to navigate , prices are brilliant and delivery times are excellent .
0	bravo !
0	when buying a none running car i didnt tjink getting it shipped to me would be this easy or affordable .
0	love the way people bid for your requirements .
0	then choose the best one , pay a deposit and the balance goes to the courier on arrival
0	they offered top brass and paid promptly .
0	omg , i thought it was a scam , mailed and complained because was an_hour late , got a response in minutes , now officially_unlocked .

0	cjs provide some of the cheapest prices found on the web for games - on that front they get 0_stars .
0	the problem is that i pre_- ordered cod : ghosts for pc and got some rather mixed messages .
0	the game description says instant delivery of the key - not true .
0	when i try to get my key it says it will be delivered 00_hours before release - not true .
0	support say it will be released in time to preload - not true ( unless you have insane (> 00mbps ) broadbnad ).
0	facebook says keys will come out at_0000hrs on 0th_nov - not true
0	key is finally available at_0000hrs
0	the game was cheap but the communication was rubbish - if they had just said upfront that i would get it a few hours before release i would be happy and have ordered , instead they give the impression before you order you will get it ' instantly ' in reality it was 0 days_later .
0	be honest guys and you will have a customer for a long time ( if you keep the prices this great !
0	).

0	i '_ve_used ebuyer . com for over 0 years and would recommend them to anyone .
0	they have a great range of items , from pc_components to printers at very reasonable prices .
0	i '_ve only once had an issue with an item i ordered ( which wasn_'_t ebuyer '_s fault ) and they were more than happy to replace it with no_quibbles - exactly_what you want when ordering online .
0	the website is clear and easy to use and has detailed technical specs for most items meaning you know what you are going to get .
0	even if what you want to know isn_'_t listed in the description you can ask them !
0	a great site and my first ( and often last ) port of call for all my tech needs .
0	nothing else to say that it was simple and fast , everything is very clear with a really intuitive site .
0	you can '_t go_wrong here , recommended 000_%

0	customer service is great and always responds promtly .
0	i also own an amazon kindle and it is my favourite gadget that i own backed_up by amazon '_s kindle bookstore all available from the device itself .
0	really good products delivered promptly .
0	any time that i have needed to contact customer service they have dealt_with my concerns quickly and completely to my satisfaction .

0	ordered an item two months_ago , which was cancelled by zavvi . com .
0	i was told my card had not been charged however came back from holiday and money had been taken out of my account .
0	0 phone_calls and 0 emails over two months and i still have not had the money refunded back to me .
0	the network itself has decent coverage , although the 0g_signal is not as good in certain_areas as other_networks .
0	i found customer_services were quite unhelpful when experiencing problems tethering on my iphone
0	myprotein offers good quality protein at a hugely competitive price - it is a pity that their free delivery catered for by yodel is absolutely_appalling .
0	my last four orders have been delivered by this company and even_though the instructions were to leave the box at the reception to my flat complex if i am not in , every_single time the delivery company has just left the boxes outside .
0	if it were not for this , myprotein would be getting 0_stars !
0	i was weighing up buying a monitor from dabs , as it had been featured as a hot offer on hotukdeals and after looking around it was by far the best price on the market .
0	i decided to sleep on it .
0	the next_day it appears as a daily deal on ebuyer .
0	it works out 00_%_cheaper and i get free next_day delivery .
0	you can '_t ask for much more than that and i look_forward to getting it tomorrow !
0	thanks ebuyer !
0	great service .
0	delivery was faster_than_expected and packaging was very secure .
0	i have used double0tickets a few_times now , and i dont even try any other_sites now .
0	i know i will get great service , fast service and the best seats .
0	i dont mind_paying a little extra because its always that extra bit special . when you go .
0	i have just purchased mumford and sons tickets , my husband thought they were sold out and really gutted he would have missed them , but as always double0tickets had tickets available , he is going to be so chuffed its his christmas_present .
0	partner ordered a chair for me for my bday 0_weeks in advance , got told was guna b 0 days then had a phone_call saying it was out of stock and b no_longer_than a week ( no_problems , plenty of time to get here for my bday ) actually ended_up being 0_weeks !
0	this was after various calls to 0000 numbers which has cost me god_knows in phone_calls .
0	next_day delivery and the cheapest tyres around .
0	every year i get my tyres from these_guys and every year they don_'_t let_me down : d
0	camera and accessories were priced lower_than most .
0	delivered in 0 days and any reservations_about hong_kong location were_unfounded .
0	ideal service with great communication and decent warranty and aftercare prospects .
0	i ' d use them again in a heartbeat .
0	i '_ve been ordering my supplements from bodybuilding - supplements . co . uk for the last_year , and the company is great .
0	quick delivery and really competitive_prices , treats existing_customers well with promotional_codes .
0	good experience ordering from them , i have ordered from them on two_separate_occasions and both_times my items were delivered quickly .
0	so i bought some items from asos around £_000 it was all delivered fine .
0	i went to return some things and the was all fine i used collect_+.
0	0 day passed and they never contacted me or said a word so i emailed and they said they hadn_'_t received it .
0	little do they know i have tracking_number so i show them and they say okay what did you send ?
0	they have no clue as to what it was in the refund .
0	they processed it and well after over 000 emails and 0 . 0 months of waiting the refund hasn_'_t gone into my bank_account and i '_m just doing the same thing over and over again .
0	its a joke and never ever ever use them !
0	this place is top_notch , i needed a game was not prepared to pay full wack for digital copy and i didn_'_t a game for 00 . 00 i got for 00 . 00 .
0	this is what i like to see good price and good delivery .
0	god_og_hurtig_levering :)
0	ordre nummer :_000000
0	if you manage to find something cheaper , they price match .
0	this site is incredible ... and you can get a free_shaker_cup with every order ... whats not to beat ?
0	!
0	i ordered my item from their web store on friday before new years_eve , the lead arrived the next_day , recorded first_class delivery .... not even amazon best these_guys service .... many other internet companies could_learn a thing about customer service from hifix ... will_def be back for more !
0	!
0	... for truly stunning beauties dressed head - to - toe in sexy latex attire .
0	what i like about this site is the quality of the models - they ' re all beautiful enough to feature on the pages of vogue !
0	- and the quality of the latex outfits .
0	there are some super sexy dresses with details that i '_ve never seen elsewhere .
0	what '_s also great about latexotica is that the girls keep their clothes on !
0	that '_s why i join sites like this , to see girls actually wearing latex .
0	if i want nudity i can find it for free everywhere .
0	overall i highly_recommend latexotica to fans of both latex and beautiful girls .
0	i don_'_t have much to say other than it was my first flight with any airline .
0	it was very easy to do the online checking in and even easier at the airport ..
0	the flight was comfortable and i had an all_round pleasant_experience ..
0	excellent , never had any_issues and i have sent loads of parcels .
0	prices are great and you get full tracking_information included as well as better compensation offered over a royal_mail .
0	would recommend to anyone .
0	never had such a simple process of having faulty handsets replaced on contract plans , even when out of gaurantee .
0	next_day delivery by courier at a time_slot of your choice .
0	brilliant !!
0	no taking phone to be repaired like o0 !
0	an immediate next_day solution !
0	rude scruffy drivers with zero manners and the ability of speaking fluent english has passed them by .
0	a shambles of a company that operates in chaos !
0	trust me i '_ve seen their_offices in sunderland and they are shocking !
0	great service and customer_care .
0	i had an issue with my order due to an it problem and they called me back within a few hours with a great solution .
0	they really do go the extra_mile when you have a problem .
0	as for the food , it '_s excellent .
0	the steaks are delicious and the chicken_breasts are enormous !
0	no loss of size once cooked either .
0	all_round excellent company , just wished i ' d ordered earlier !
0	!
0	speedy process for peace of mind .
0	order was wrong and the items were split , this was clearly_visible before packing as the outer_packaging was perfect so was nothing to do with the courier .
0	i have been trying to contact myprotein for 0 week with no definitive response on what they are going to do to help me .
0	very bad start to my dealings with myprotein hope they resolve this soon !
0	our holiday to budapest was excellent the deal we got on the hotel was brilliant as the soho boutique hotel was very nice .
0	the rooms were not huge but there was enough space and the finish was very good .
0	the staff were excellent and lowcostholidays recommended it as one of the best deals .
0	low_cost are up front with all costs and don_'_t hide any fees .
0	the website is easy to use and they give you all your info in one handy booklet !
0	ordered a samsung_galaxy_tab 0 . 0 00 gb white on a deal that was posted on a daily deal website for 000 . 00 , while it could have been a mistake on their part , that is what was advertised , many people ordered but they couldnt fulfill the order and they blamed their stock system , surely if you tell the system that there are say 0000 items , when 0000 sales are done , the item becomes out of stock and unavailable for further purchase .
0	instead they chose to go_ahead and take the card_details and then a couple of days_later sent a bulk email_saying they had to cancel it , they probably didnt want to sell it on the cheap , offered no apology , no commercial gesture ( ie a voucher or something ) and then cancelled the order .
0	even after they tweeted the deal they still didnt do anything but were quite happy to get the free advertising from the deal .
0	that was my first and last order from their website and i wouldnt go into their stores or recommend them .
0	have bought gifts for parents and friends , various mugs for work and they are reasonably_priced and i love the novelty items .
0	no issues with customer service and delivery on 0 orders so_far
0	i live two miles_away and i can usually collect on my way to and from work , plenty of parking in the reading store and usually no other customers than me whenever i go .
0	staff are friendly and seem knowledgeable enough ( but i never need sales assistance anyway as i buy parts ).
0	have bought all parts for my new computer from there and collected when it was ready .
0	they are usually a couple of quid more_expensive than amazon or dabs but the fact i dont pay postage and can get the item the same day by collecting is a trade - off i am willing to make .
0	can even get quidco_cashback so that makes up a little_bit .
0	any_issues i just go back in there and they test the component there and then , had a doa ram and they replaced it on the spot with a new one .
0	have been recommending this to my local friends and colleagues .
0	amazon is simply great
0	great prices
0	great customer service
0	no issues with deliveries , always very quick and they dont use parcelforce !
0	puts most of the other_retailers to shame
0	delivery from two retailers , email and text advises me it has arrived onto the depot and will be delivered next_day , option to choose the delivery date if the proposed one is not suitable .
0	on the morning of the delivery you get a timeslot .
0	drivers are friendly and polite and respect the supplied timeslot .
0	i highly recomment their service .
0	complete liars .
0	never ring the door_bell with about a dozen deliveries in two years , yet the postman is able to ring the bell ok .
0	constantly having to drive and park in town to go and pick_up from the post_office .
0	if i wanted to go to the shops i wouldnt have bought the items online .
0	their customer service is useless its handled by people who have never seen a parcel or a doorbell and probably not even in the uk .
0	when you ring the 00xx number it sends you to another depot , only to be told my local_depot have switched their phones off .
0	why people still use them i dont_know ?
0	!!!!!!
0	avoid like the plague !!!!
0	!
0	i have been buying goods from ebuyer since_0000 and ebuyer used to be really good and have recommended it to many friends and work_colleagues .
0	delivery was brilliant when they were using citylink .
0	prices were right and quality of the items was really good .
0	had one bad_experience with a faulty item collected from my place and returned to my old adress , one of their agents was plain rude and in the wrong ( got this confirmed by trading_standards ) which was only sorted when another agent picked_up the enote 0 months later , leaving me with without my mp0_player and my money ... not great customer service .
0	decided to stop ordering from them for almost 0yrs .
0	then wanted to give them a second chance hoping they had sorted their issues but i got bitten twice , this time by the crap delivery company they use ( parcelforce ) who never ring the house despite the fact that i am in but seem to be quite happy to put a card in the letterbox and making me collect it from the post_office for a delivery which i paid , rearranging a delivery takes over a week .
0	complained to ebuyer to complain got an answer 0_weeks_later ..
0	this has appened again on my latest delivery .
0	unfortunately the delivery company is the only contact between ebuyer and its customer and on top of that the poor customer experience i had with ebuyer means i will now stop using and recommending ebuyer altogheter .
0	i have to admit that i was a little_sceptical at first given all the scammers out there , but i '_m now overjoyed that i can now use my iphone on any network !
0	!
0	since my iphone was locked to o0 uk , i did have to wait for 00 days till the unlock arrived , but at_least the website allowed_me to check the status of my order any time i wanted .
0	also , it may be good to note that once you effect payment , the company will ask you to verify the order by sending a photo_id or at_least the frontside of the credit_card used to pay ( card number covered ) - it seems its just the company '_s way to ensure that they are not deaing with a scammer !
0	!
0	truly a wonderful service at a reasonable price !
0	!
0	will_definitely recommend !

0	blackcircles sent email confirmation on thursday that the tyres i ordered had arrived at the garage ready for my fitting_appointment .
0	when we arrived at the garage on saturday_morning there was no tyres !
0	disgraceful !
0	turns_out blackcircles hadn_'_t even ordered them from their supplier .
0	shocking !
0	result , i '_ve taken my business elsewhere , event mobile tyres sorted me out with new tyres_fitted by monday_lunchtime .
0	they had the cheek to offer a 00_%_discount off my next order as compensation .
0	no chance of that ever being used ... then i suppose they knew that already .
0	pathetic service .
0	we strive towards great customer service , and as a uk_based company , we are here to listen to your comments and improve wherever necessary
0	this is the same company as iflorist , please read their reviews first before buying
0	i ordered a bouquet of flowers on the 00th of december in order to receive them on the 00th of december as a gift to my wife .
0	on the 00th we made sure that someone was in the house at all times and also mentioned to my neighbors to watch out in case we didn_'_t see them being delivered .
0	the bouquet never arrived , they were supposed to be delivered via yodel , and i received an email_stating that they had been delivered , it also stated they had been left safe ( strange as i was at home ), so i ran around my house looking for them but found nothing , i then spent about an_hour knocking on neighbours doors trying to find if they had been delivered to the wrong_address , but noone had received the delivery .
0	as they were closed on the 00th and 00th i proceeded to contact yodel to follow my delivery who stated that they had been left in the front_porch .......
0	i do not have a front_porch ?
0	i then contacted iflorist who can only be contacted via live_chat on their website and they take about 0 mins to answer any 0 line of questioning or response , very slow .... all i was told is that they will investigate .
0	so now i have a very unhappy wife who thinks i forgot about her flowers for christmas and no response as to when or if they will be delivered
0	update 00 . 00 . 00 - i emailed iflorist and chatted to them online on the 00th and still have no response after 00hrs
0	update 00 . 00 . 00 - i have chatted to iflorist , they have told me to check with neighbours , which i had already done on the 00th and now the flowers were dead , they then gave_me a phone number to call : 00000000000
0	update 00 . 00 . 00 - i have called iflorist , they have told me they will be getting the flowers redelivered on the friday 0th of january so they will be delayed by a total of 00 days late , i also asked if they were going to do anything_else , and the answer was a simple : " no , company policy states that all we can do is have the flowers redlivered "
0	the weekend was organised exactly to my specification and executed flawlessly .
0	the guide was very friendly , well_organised and kept us all on the straight and narrow road to a drink fuelled weekend .
0	use this service for a stress_free weekend where all you need to do is pay and the rest is done for you .
0	purchased a product and wished to return it , however the return process was awful , and is still ongoing !
0	had to wait 00 days to get a response from the returns people , and when i go a response they wanted to charge me 00_% of the cost of the item as a ' handling charge ' to return the item .
0	unacceptable !!
0	never buy a product from here if you think you might need to return it at any point .
0	very disappointed .
0	i was searching the internet for a pc which was affordable , good quality , and ready for gaming components .
0	i found arbico and they seemed to be a very trust_worthy company just from the quality of their site , but anyway i bought a pc with , what seemed to be average parts / specification ( amd athlon dual_core 0hz , 0gb_ram , asus m0a00l - mlx motherboard , and a 000gb_hdd ).
0	so i ordered the pc for around £_000 all together i think and i received it within 0 days , which is what i expected as a minimum .
0	the pc was amazing without tweaks and new parts , but as i wanted a computer which was amazing at handling games and video .
0	i bought an asus geforce gtx_000 ti video card for £_000 and the computer is amazing .
0	i am so happy with the product and the customer service i received .
0	hi , my name is simon newman .
0	i use hostelbookers all the time as they have a good variety of places to choose from and since it is a well established site it has many reviews that help me make an informed_decision .
0	i recently placed my first order after using lush for so many_years !
0	i mainly ordered for myself , bath bombs and soap , but also purchased a gift pack for an_upcoming birthday as the packs were exceptional value !
0	paid for standard delivery but received it next_day and a free_sample was also included !
0	bonus .
0	highly_recommended based on my recent_purchase .
0	ive been a customer of virgin_media services for a while , no major problems with the service and the price i pay is rather reasonable .
0	one problem , which was rather sneaky - i phoned up as the one time my service wasn_'_t working they offered me a discount !
0	the chap on the phone said i wouldn_'_t be tied in to another 00 month_contract but several days_later i received a new contract !!!
0	nothing like deception
0	popped in to a local_store today as need a part for pc fast - first of all , ridiculous prices - i cant_believe people pay their over_inflated_prices !!!
0	!
0	sales people so pushy its unbelievable !!
0	!
0	wouldn_'_t ever shop there again !
0	order from mp several_times .... always good service , quick delivery and great products !
0	call plans are ok if your a home customer , choice of phones is average but worst of all is customer_services - it '_s ridiculous trying to sort a problem , get answers etc .
0	recently went in to comet to purchase a new washing_machine .
0	the experience had it '_s good points and it '_s bad points !!!
0	!
0	the washer was good value , delivery was free and they took my old one away .
0	the sales_rep was ridiculously pushy , constantly trying to push us to a more_expensive washer despite telling them our budget .
0	at the checkout he tried for 00_minutes to get us to take out extended_warranty - in the end i said i would think about it so we could leave !
0	0 hour later i received a phone_call asking if i was ready to take out the extended_warranty and he wasn_'_t best pleased when i said no .
0	overall : good value , shame about the pushy_sales .
0	i was sceptic at first , didn_'_t really believe that they would smell exactly the same , but then i decided to order a bottle and give it a try .
0	i purchased millionaire ( inspired by 0 million paco_rabanne ), received it today and it '_s spot on !
0	applied early this morning and still smells great several hours_later !
0	it came neatly_packaged in a carton ( as if id bought a product from the shop ).
0	delivery was quick and cost £ 0 . 00 ( free for orders over £_00 . 00 ), ok it '_s not free but it still works out cheaper_than high_street shopping .
0	will be going back for more as have lots to choose from and it cost a fraction of the price .
0	got my iphone_0s locked to orange uk unlocked within_00hrs .

0	my iphone_0gs was locked to at & t , officialiphoneunlock . co . uk got it unlocked within a day !

0	just had 0 new tyres_fitted and i cannot recommend etyres highly_enough .
0	i got 0 goodyears that are just about the highest_rated tyre you can get for economy and grip and i paid as much as some garages charge you for the budget option .
0	they came to my house , fitted them on the drive and the customer service was spot on .
0	money well spent .
0	i would strongly_recommend buying from cjs as it is simple to buy a product and fast ( normally instantly ) to receive your key .
0	also this comes at a much_cheaper price and good customer_support , something bigger companies need to learn about these days !
0	0_stars cjs !

0	whatever i am looking for , i can usually find it or an_alternative at ebuyer .
0	with great choices at great prices , i try not to shop anywhere_else for both domestic and business purchases .
0	even on cheap saver delivery selection i usually get my items the next_day !
0	i just haven_'_t found better anywhere_else !
0	great work ebuyer , keep it up .
0	easy to navigate and easy to install .
0	cons_: installation seemed to take_forever but it got there in the end . never had issues with free directions map and they '_ve been my go - to for directions for quite some time now .
0	this site is the best comparison site i have used in a very long time .
0	when i first went_onto the site it was extremely easy to use and you had thousands of rooms to compare in a matter of seconds .
0	booking the room was flexible aswell and i would reccomend to absolutely anyone who_wants something which is cheap easy to use and flexible .
0	fantastic !!!!!
0	no concerns at all .
0	this site is absolutely fantastic .
0	would reccomend to absolutely anyone .
0	used it many many_times which is unusual for me as i am not even that frequent of an internet user .
0	would use this service any day of the week and if your pocket is tight i would definetely use this service to help yourself !!!
0	!
0	i would reccomend this company anytime to get a great deal on the internet . hardly_any sites like this which compare destinations and hotels as good as this .
0	if your departing on a holiday in the next 0_weeks i would definetely reccomend this service
0	as always my protein was great on price and product , however false statements on product descriptions and refusal to refund 0 products i ordered and did not need as a result of their mistake , let them down completely and i was left very frustrated .
0	they really didn_'_t seem to care that i was annoyed with their service either .
0	also beware of their points system , it '_s very poorly ran , my account had gone into minus figures , and i had saved numerous points whicheck theh wiped at the end of the year without warning ( it does say in the t &_c '_s but a warning would have been nice ...) if ordering from these just make_sure you are 000_% certain with your order before you place it as you can '_t edit an order after paying .
0	you have to cancel , get a refund and order again !!
0	very annoying company but great products and price .
0	no_hidden_fees and a very easy interface .
0	loved it !
0	will be using it more often .
0	i never usually_write_reviews but i feel i need to as i am so happy with the service i recieved and the watch i purchased .
0	i had been serching for the tw_steel watch for awhile now and found it on this site .
0	i had never spent so much over the internet without seeing the item first so was very nervous_about purchasing from the site .
0	i called first and spoke to a guy called keiron , all my worrys went out the window , he said that its completely safe and that they were a reputable_company and i would recieve the watch the next_day and if i wasnt happy i could have a refund with no_fuss .
0	i ordered the watch and like he said it arrived the next_day ..... and ..... wow what a stunning watch and well_packed , im extremely happy with the services and most of all the watch .
0	many_thanks watchfinder for a professional experience and an amazing watch , i will be sure to save you in my favourites .
0	i needed a flighcase for my laptop very urgent , i found them on google the case was it very good price , and the sales_person was very helpful to me , the case was orded on a friday and it turned_up saturday_morning , the laptop fits in the case very snugg and it doesn_'_t move around while in side , the case is of very good quality very strong , well made and it will last years to come on the road , i need many cases for the future and i will be returning to get more soon !
0	thanks guys !

0	found the cosutme i wanted , and they were the cheapest online .
0	it arrived in 0 - 0 days , despite using the slowest free delivery option .
0	item was in perfect_condition , brand_new etc .
0	i would definitely use them again ( maybe even if they weren_'_t the cheapest ).
0	could not fault the service , flowers looke fine , however when i arrived home to see them , i asked my fiance where she had put the rest of them , but there were no more .
0	cant_fault the company .
0	reliable fast service .
0	good pricing .
0	after a month of hassle from myprotein , i had to look else where for my supplements .
0	i had heard of bulkpowders but hadn_'_t known any one that had used them .
0	the company reminded_me of myprotein of old .
0	first order placed , website was easy to use , received my order on time , and prices very good .
0	still don_'_t know my way around the products but i have no_complaints about the protein_blend .
0	after being offered 00_%_off to regain my custom , i decided to make an order .
0	now i remember why i stopped using this company .
0	i ordered on the 0th_november with 0 day delivery , on the 0th i received an email_saying that my order would be a few_days late .
0	a week_later i sent and email asking when it might be with me , well 0 emails later and no human response , i have a look on facebook and see ' i '_m not the only one .
0	after numerous failed_attempts at contact via phone and email , i finally get promised a refund , that didn_'_t happen until the intervention of paypay on the 0th_december .
0	i had my reservation about sending off a phone with the promise of money ( good money ) being paid to me , i needn_'_t have worried .
0	the whole proses was easy and efficient , less_than 00hours from looking at the website to receiving funds .
0	one piece of advice though , post the phone special delivery , it will cost £ 0 . 00 but in my opinion worth is .
0	i had a friend send his standard royal_mail and it got lost in the post , and was left out of pocket .
0	special delivery is insured for up to £_000 and guaranteed next_day with a receipt .
0	brought a lot of scuba_gear recently , equipment information was vast , prices were very competitive , and the service was fantastic .
0	would definitely recommend !
0	will_definately_use feedem again !
0	i too ordered my bean_bags in november_0000 off groupon with the small_print of ' please allow up to 0_weeks delivery ' it is now mon 00 february_0000 and i still_haven_'_t recieved any of them .
0	after months of frustrating phone_calls and emails , to which i had no reply , the only correspondance i have had is off groupon .
0	this company is an embarrassment .
0	they have taken the money out of my account , including the £_00 . 00 for delivery ( of what ?
0	you might ask ).
0	i have written numerous_emails asking for them to at_least pay me the delivery charge back as they have been so useless .
0	yet up to this date i have not received anything , not even a reply back off them .
0	what a proffessional company !!
0	!
0	bike sure is a trading broker associated to adrain flux .
0	i recently had the mis_- fortune of dealing_with this company .
0	all i can describe them is that they are a bunch of thugs .
0	basically i tried to insure my trike and having had a quote which was £_000_quid more over the telephone .
0	i decided to go with a quote online which was way cheaper .
0	as soon as i was about to pay they immediately found out that i had already had a quote over the phone and were unwilling to honour the online quote even after being given quote online .
0	they operate on very dodgy grounds and seem to think that if you get into a contract with them online then it is acceptable to withdraw that contract at anytime if they find that the premium was too low .
0	however if you had done the same as a customer they would charge you hefty cancellation_fees etc .
0	in my view this company operates on dodgy grounds and adrian_flux which is the parent_company are aware of the policies and practices .
0	in my view i would stay well away from bike sure and adrian_flux who i have had a bad_experience with .
0	i have reported this company to the ombudsman and fsa .
0	i used e_- outdoors for the first time , items were in stock !
0	. order confirmed , despatched and arrived within a few_days . brilliant , many_thanks .
0	i '_ve bought from gak a few_times and every experience has_been positive .
0	i will be buying again .
0	very quick despatch , easy buying process .
0	how it should be !
0	come on itv a big company like you , and you online player doesnt even work i have super_fast internet and your player keeps hanging whats up with that
0	sort it out
0	great customer service sales_team is very helpful and have many top products on offer , prices are a bit higher but you poy for what you get top_class service
0	everyone_knows gooles is just the best i what ever it does
0	easy to use website very informed order status and updates items arrive in good time and great customer_support if you do have any troubles a ++++++
0	the best company to order from if your based in the uk they are by far the best when it comes to delivery speed everytime i have ordered my item has arrived next_day you cant get better_than that , very helpful sales_team who are happy to help with any questions you may have , all in all a top website 0 +++++
0	wan to get a cheap price and awesome services ?

0	bought bosch top of range washing_machine .
0	also paid for delivery , fit and remove old machine .
0	they arrived , said they don_'_t disconnect existing machines , that '_s up to the customer , and left the new machine in the middle the kitchen_floor .
0	they said ring this number and we '_ll come_back once your old machines disconnected .
0	we rang and they have so_far failed to turn three_times in three_days .
0	some useless person_who claimed to be customer service called tony lowbridge responded to an email from me asking for help .
0	he promised to come_back to me and did nothing .
0	after being let_down three_days in a row , i have arranged to take the old machine to the kettering branch of currys where i was sold the bosch and service package .
0	i plan to place the old scrapper in the middle of their store and tell the manager what dreadful service they give .
0	looking_forward to revenge on saturday_morning ..
0	never buy white good from currys .
0	absolutely_appalling company .
0	pay a little extra and go to a reliable supplier like john_lewis .
0	i '_m about to send the email correspondence with this tony lowbridge to dixons group plc ceo sebastian james ... if he doesn_'_t already know , he needs to be told that his knowhow customer service team is uncaring , ineffective and more interested in avoiding ownership of customer problems .
0	they just don_'_t know how .
0	i ordered a silver tuxedo for a cruise .
0	it said delivery in three working_days .
0	when i rang to chase it up i was informed that it was not kept in stock and the supplier was on holiday until the 0th_jan .
0	my cruise leaves on the 0th .
0	however they accepted the cancellation and refunded the money quickly .
0	order was quick and easy .
0	best price i found .
0	delivered quickly .
0	can '_t ask for more .
0	ordered an item on day 0 , got notification via_email and text about status of order , and it arrived within 0 days .
0	very pleased .
0	if you dont use supplementwarehouse then fuck you
0	got a great price for my nokia mobile .
0	mazuma were extremely quick in paying me - was very impressed .
0	would use them again .
0	great website , they reply fast and they deliver for free and yet very fast .
0	i am always looking for places to buy my supplements and i came_across this store today and wow !!!
0	the inventory is great , not to mention the prices !!
0	almost 00_%_cheaper then the big retail names and you can '_t beat the automatic 0 %_discount if you find the item cheaper on another website .
0	great store , i will_continue to come_back to this store for my supplement_needs .
0	easy selection , great options , good prices , tone of freebies .
0	the only thing that could be better is the shipping prices .
0	great range , amazing service form start to finish and the end_result is stunning .

0	i needed an_urgent diagnostic of our electric_shower and boiler issue .
0	drew came over within a few hours , evaluated all my options and explained in layman ’_s terms what the problems were .
0	i can now make an informed_decision of what i want to do and when i ’ ve decided i ’ ll certainly use pimlico_plumbers for the work .
0	mid - level from a cost perspective however i ’ ve gone for the cheaper option in the past and its come_back to haunt me .
0	thanks pimlico and thanks drew .
0	first time ordering from this site .
0	i saved_myself 000 $ instead of going somewhere_else to buy my supplements .
0	fairly cheap shipping , but really really cheap supplements .
0	dont_waste your time looking for a cheaper site , listen to me and order from here !
0	i virtually always find books , games or whatever i am looking for at amazon .
0	needless to say , i buy here somewhat frequently .
0	the shipping is flexible and prices are decent .
0	i once didn_'_t receive my order , and amazon swiftly sent a new item which arrived right away .
0	recommended !
0	despite the title , the customer service people are polite and seem to be doing what they can .
0	still this doesn_'_t change the appalling fact that both our order three years back , and now an order almost a year back were both massively delayed .
0	there has_been lots of mails going back and forth , and the delivery date has_been postponed over and over .
0	in the end we got our order , but only after nearly a year (!)
0	of waiting .
0	of course the customer service offers vouchers you can use on your next purchase .
0	given these two depressing experiences , i consider the vouchers worthless as i will never ever deal with this company again .
0	stay_away from infurn !
0	you have been_warned .
0	decided to use parcel0go and what an excellent service .
0	had a slight_problem with the address and the customer service rep william ... sorted it out double quick .
0	incredible next_day delivery and worked_perfectly
0	very happy , good delivery and the handles just what we hoped for
0	thank_you for an excellent speedy service
0	amazing communications & speedy service .
0	having signed_up for trustpilot for my website , i decided not to continue with the paid for service (£_000 per_month ).
0	all was running well and was getting some good reviews of our service , as would be expected as we offer a great product .
0	however , having received a couple of negative_reviews about our service ( which were totally untrue and looked as though they were written by a competitor ) i decided to try and comment on them as a company .
0	no such luck as trustpilot told me my username + password were incorrect .
0	i thought i must have forgotten my password , but it turns_out the email address i signed_up with wasn_'_t recognised .
0	after about a week of contacting trustpilot support and trying to convince them that i own the company that i own , finally they told me that the email address i signed_up with was " donotallowaccess @ xxxxx " - well obviously i would never have signed_up with such an email address !!
0	now because this email address doesn_'_t " go_anywhere " , i can '_t use the " forgot password " link either .
0	clearly because i have refused to pay the £_000 per_month fee , they have prevented me access to the site , and i am now unable to defend my company against some blatantly untrue reviews .
0	be warned - if you don_'_t pay trustpilot a ridiculous_amount of money , they were bar access to your company and leave you totally unable to defend yourself against false reviews .
0	this is nothing short of being a total_scam .
0	had i have known this , i would never have signed_up with trust_pilot in the first place , i just wanted my customers the freedom to express themselves , turns_out it was the worst decision i ever made .
0	do not sign up with trustpilot .
0	my handset was locked to orange uk which i bought 0nd_hand from ebay , i called up orange and they said they couldn_'_t unlock it .
0	i contacted this company who unlocked it in 00_hours as they promised .
0	what more could i ask ?
0	i ordered the unlock online , and within 00_hours it was ready .
0	then all you have to do is plug the phone into itunes with a new sim_card in , and it unlocks !
0	laughably simple .
0	definitely worth doing , now i can use my phone in new_zealand and then swap the sim back to the old one when i go home .
0	highly_recommended
0	bought a game late one night and 0 days_later it was at my door .
0	can '_t get much_better_than that !
0	highly_recommended .
0	great service and very good customer_care .
0	keep it up
0	products are okay but then service needs to be more professional .
0	quality of product was exceptional at the price paid had bought and returned furniture from other_places because of shoddy workmanship at the same price and more really pleased
0	i used hostelbookers a lot when i was travelling a few_years_ago .
0	today was the first time since then .
0	the website is really well_designed and allows for a quick and easy way to find hostels and book them .
0	as i expect most people do i also checked the hostels own website , and another well_known hostel booking website .
0	hostelbookers was cheaper_than both .
0	especially the other website , and there was no booking_fee !
0	perfect !
0	this website carries great brands at great prices !
0	he site is very easy to use and it is quick and simple to find your product here .
0	im definitely coming_back
0	great service , for the best price by a mile .
0	every question i asked was met with a good answer , the people i spoke too were polite and enthusiastic which seems to have disappeared from a lot of places but is as important as anything_else in my opinion .
0	great shop .
0	cant_complain at all
0	i have ordered a few items from shopto now and have always been impressed with their cheap prices and fast delivery .
0	every item i have ordered has turned_up the next working day .
0	highly_recommended
0	i tried to review another company and was unable to do so last_week .
0	i spoke to a member of staff who advised that after a week of waiting i should have been contacted .
0	i was advised to leave a review as this would be a quicker process then an internal email .
0	i was advised on the sales call to me that the reason that i could not place a review was due to an influx of people reviewing .
0	doesn_'_t fill me with confidence from the start until now of this process .
0	the ultimate betting site .
0	i use this site every day i like the banner .
0	hope i win today
0	what an amazing company !
0	shipping is so fast and the despatch time is very quick .
0	ive switched all my pre orders to simply_games due to the fantastic service and price !

0	paris 0000 august .
0	we went to paris for our_honeymoon , the city is amazing .
0	the transfer from the airport to the hotel was fine , driver did not speak_english but we were taking in the atmosphere so did ' nt mind .
0	the return transfer was the problem .
0	i called to reconfirm our transfer 00_hours before and followed all the steps that were set out to us .
0	the driver was to arrive at 0 . 00 am .
0	0 . 00 am and no driver , i called the resorthoppa emergency_number and was told our driver was on his way .
0	our flight was at 0 . 00am .
0	00_mins later and our hotel recieved a call from our driver to say ' i '_ve had a problem with my car , i '_m not coming , sorry '.
0	at this point we were panicking as we had little to no money ( paris is expensive ) and were told a taxi would cost around 00 euro '_s .
0	luckily our hotel receptionist managed to get us a taxi down to 00 euro '_s .
0	i called the resorthoppa emergency_number time and time again at this point and the phone would put us on hold and then hang up everytime !
0	after a long run to the cash point ( i literally sprinted ) i luckily had 00 euro '_s in the bank and ran back to the hotel .
0	we managed to get our flight on time but not without the upset and stress with resorthoppa .
0	especially to finish off our_honeymoon !
0	to top it off due to the rush i forgot to get a reciept from the taxi so will not be refunded for the inconvenience .
0	as the return transfer was pre_paid i will be claiming for that back .
0	do not use resorthoppa in paris for a return transfer .
0	once you have arrived at your hotel they will not be interested in getting you home again .
0	disgusting .
0	i usually buy my games from tesco ( staff discount ), gameseek were the cheapest place to buy infamous , and then to make things even better , the game arrived the day before release !
0	ive made quite a few orders over the years , not a single order has had a problem .
0	delivery is always earlier_than_expected .
0	ive_used a few other suppliment sites , but still come_back to mp , their price and service cant be_beaten online .
0	i made an order with blueunplugged on boxing_day .
0	when i ordered , they had one item listed as out of stock , due in 0 - 0 days .
0	i knew it would be a little delayed being the christmas_period , and the 0 - 0 days weren_'_t a problem .
0	as of yesterday , it still says on the site , due in 0 - 0 days , and my order still " not shipped ", 00 days after my order , its still telling people 0 - 0 days !
0	i emailed them twice , at two different emails they have listed , and didn_'_t get a reply , i then had to phone them and demand a refund as they could not provide the goods .
0	today , a day after phoning and getting a refund , i get an email from them saying they thought this had been dealt_with yesterday .
0	they obviously don_'_t check dates of emails sent .
0	this was my first order with blueunplugged , and it will_definitely be my last !
0	the only reason i ordered from them was because they were a little_bit cheaper_than everywhere_else .
0	after i got the refund yesterday i made an order with mobilefun , dispatched within 00_minutes , delivered in less_than 00 , and only £ 0 more_expensive than blueunplugged .
0	lesson_learnt .
0	i was looking for a way to get me goods from one side of the country to the other .
0	stumbling_across shiply helped_me get my goods at a really cheap price .
0	i would use them again for any collections i need .
0	after_searching many sites i found that skyparksecure offered the best prices for airport_parking , and even_though i had to change my booking 0 times the service was fantastic .
0	wouldnt_hesitate to book with them again .
0	i bought a pair of bench glasses , at a bargain price .
0	buying glasses online is something i had been unsure of doing , but 00 / 00 for speckyfoureyes .
0	the measurements and picture were spot on and the glasses arrived very quickly in the post .
0	i can '_t think of any negatives , and will never again be paying over_inflated_prices for glasses in the high_street , i '_ll be using speckyfoureyes again , have already ordered my partner a pair !
0	didn_'_t even have to enter a different price because they were already the lowest .
0	awseome buy 0 get one free sale on the creatine i love which i cant find at any local_stores .
0	also got a bunch of free and dicounted stuff with my order which greatly off set the shipping .
0	deffinetly will be a repeat_customer !
0	i have made a couple of orders now , both of which were at the cheapest price on the web .
0	the items were dispatched the very same day , and the communication from the company is excellent , firstly with a delivery estimate day , then later with an_hour_slot so there '_s no waiting in all day or coming home to find the annoying card telling you your item is in a warehouse open between 00 and 00am !
0	after a couple of orders i have even been sent a discount_code for my next order .
0	overall , based on my experience i could not recommend this company enough , impeccable service and no_hassle !
0	i always order all my stuff off this website never had a problem or issue they are the cheapest and they have great products .. i always recevie my items fast !
0	item has_been " pending " since i bought it on the 00th of december .
0	according to their delivery schedule it should have arrived on the 00st but did not .
0	great weekend .
0	all organisation taken_care of .
0	great value
0	best price on the net and delivered next_day ( saturday ) superb !

0	thanks !
0	my package was just delivered by a cycle courier who was very professional .
0	this is my only experience with apc , and i am most impressed .
0	thank_you very much .
0	i spoke to someone in the office called steve and he was extremely rude and unhelpful .
0	do not recommend !
0	i get stuff nearly every week from amazon .
0	i love the site !
0	always arrives on time and only ever had one thing i had to return because it was damaged , however to be fair it was easily breakable .
0	i received a refund straight_away .
0	love argos , cheap good , great service !
0	as i have been buying products for years from other_sites , i have found the one i will be sticking with .
0	the prices are great and the selection is huge .
0	if you are looking for either or both of those , this is the place to shop .
0	thanks
0	sent my watch for some rather needed tlc after 0 years , for full service and polish .

0	i recently had my ford_focus serviced at stoneacre thirsk which i had no_problems with at all , the receptionist was very polite and professional they even came and picked the car up and dropped it back off .
0	i carnt comment on any other stoneacre as ive only dealt_with thirsk .
0	they rang before commencing any additional work and explained everything as im not good with cars .
0	hope this helps .
0	today , 00 : 00 : 00 – flag – like – reply – delete – edit – moderate
0	incredible customer service .
0	they rang me twice ; once when my order was shipped to glasgow instead of nottingham , ( not their fault at all , yet the courtesy to ring is amazing ), and once when my order had been delivered .
0	will be using again for sure .
0	> clean and simple
0	> easy to use
0	> search_results are more specific , and usually find what i am searching for immediately .
0	which is not always the case with other search_engines .
0	secure and easy to use .
0	never had any_issues in the years since i have been using paypal .
0	one of the best payment solutions around .
0	delivery was super_fast , and the description was exact .
0	i would reccomend to do_business with !
0	the first things that might strike you about winner . com , and its casino page in particular , are the bonuses and they are top quality bonuses .
0	usual procedure applies but my luck seemed in with this site as i actually managed to accumulate some substantial winnings from the bonus which was a surprise given my luck with other casino_sites !
0	there are a truly extensive_range of top quality games on here .
0	they do bingo and poker superbly and any fans of those games will have a lot of fun on this support with great support , a live casino version of a number of games and the bonuses i mentioned .
0	i ’ ve been reliably informed that the poker is particularly good by other friends who play it more frequently than i !
0	as far as gaming sites go casino ’_s always seem to be more accessible and friendly .
0	you won_’_t find much_better customer service and the layout of the site is so user_friendly that anyone can get involved and have fun doing so .
0	i play for the slots and have found the absolute best games from all my other favourite sites here in one location with good graphics , smooth gameplay , quick transactions and decent payouts .
0	overall i ’ d say winner . com is in my top 0 online casino_sites and gets a definite thumbs_up from me .
0	absolutely spot on .
0	seamless service and presentation , smooth operations and an easy to navigate process .
0	would reccomend again and again , never once had a problem that was the fault of just eat .
0	found a corner of the market and blew it up .
0	kudos .
0	i booked a pair of return tickets to houston with opodo for 0_weeks time .
0	everything seemed fine .
0	money was debited from my account like normal and didn_'_t think anything of it .
0	received booking confirmation , everything seemed completely normal .
0	around four days_later , the money came back into my account which i thought was strange , so i decided to do a little research .
0	to my horror , i found hundreds of bad_reviews .
0	one after the other .
0	i immediately pulled all my money from my bank_account .
0	i used the money that they didn_'_t take to book direct with the airline for £_00 more .
0	today - 0 days_later .
0	they have decided to take the money , leaving me overdrawn as i am a student .
0	ive tried for days to ring them .
0	and like many , many others .
0	nothing but stupid music on the phone .
0	the whole ' my opodo " thing doesn_'_t work , it claims to not even recognise my email address .
0	luckily my bank have been most helpful and have sent me a fraud form to fill in , they will re - credit my account for me , and take on the fight with opodo by my side .
0	dont be_fooled_by such a bad company .
0	i wish i read_reviews first !
0	lesson_learnt .
0	it '_s always better paying that tiny_bit extra and going direct with the airline .
0	supplement_warehouse gives out lots of free_samples and has great prices overall .
0	i think the layout of the website could still be improved to rival the user_friendly interface of bodybuilding . com , but due to the affordability , and exposure to smaller brands who need the support of new buyers i love coming_back to this website .
0	just used supplement_warehouse for the first time and love it .
0	was recomended by a friend and i '_m very impressed .
0	prices were great and all_kinds of deals !
0	will_definitely be my first choice from now on .
0	i bought a copa del rey final ticket 0 months before the event .
0	i was supposed to get it mailed and they told me they had a problem but they will find me a ticket .
0	i fly to madrid from la book an over price hotel because of the event and they cancel my ticket 0 hours before kick off tell me this not depressing .
0	to be outside of a stadium and not be able to go in .
0	that was so easy and qiuck and free to unlock your carrier .
0	i gotta_say for a once in a lifetime stag_party , chillisauce made it extra special .
0	from day one with the price to the excellent organiser we were treated to a greay experiance in newcastle .
0	hotel was great , karting and painballing awesome and casino was out of this world !!
0	!
0	treated well by everyone and everything just exceeded_expectation .
0	you gotta get to newcastle and experiance the thrill of the karting and the friendly warm_welcome the george hotel welcomes you with !!
0	!
0	thanks chillisauce !!

0	my first order took a couple of days to arrive .
0	when it arrived it was completely the wrong product ( the box had already been opened ).
0	i retunred this and i was sent the correct product .
0	this had been sealed but appeared to have been opened previously .
0	i set the product up and it turned_out to be faulty .
0	thoroughly annoyed by the whole_experience .
0	most companies only sell name brand products . supplement_warehouse allows you to try different products that actually produce results .
0	i '_ve been using them since i deploy to afghanistan and never had any complaints .
0	awesome awesome company
0	i was connected within a minute .
0	my issue was that i had ordered a duplicate parcel , and needed to cancel one .
0	the service i received ( from sammie_taylor ) was very quick and polite .
0	very impressed with the whole service ... prices are excellent , delivery is really fast and the sales_team are quick and helpful with any_queries you may have .
0	0_star company , i will be using them for all my stationary needs from now
0	very nice handling of the client , constant feedbacking of the order , fast shipping .
0	ordered at 00am the flowers were delivered by midday - fantastic !
0	delivered with great quality and on time :)
0	we have ordered underfloor_heating from this company for many_years_now .
0	they have always provided excellent service , quality goods and fast delivery .
0	using iphone and 0 g to write his as day six of no phone service or internet without_any reason from talk_talk - called numerous_times and nothing but prescripted responses - appalling service .
0	just a quick note of caution when booking - dont make any errors as you cannot change these .
0	clicked on wrong date and was made to pay full_amount for the reservation .
0	didnt want to cancel just put in correct date !
0	very inflexible system and more than useless customer_support .
0	needless to say i wont be using late rooms again
0	i called them after_seeing an advert on tv , you found their service to be really good .
0	they were helpful and managed to get you compensation .
0	i '_ve_used amazon for buying many things that i find necessary .
0	never had any_problems with receiving my goods .
0	definitely a good shopping_experience and recommended to other users .
0	the guy i dealt_with was exceptionally knowledgeable about the destination i was looking at and even highlighted points of interest from his own trip there – a real personal_touch !
0	customer service was flawless and he deal with my 0000 questions patiently and effectively .
0	i will_definitely be booking through you guys again !
0	thanks !
0	excellent customer service .
0	the product arrived very fast , on time and in perfect_condition , there prices are fantastic , i have not found a better service anywhere , i have and will recommend them to everyone i know who_likes quality goods and service .
0	highly recommed .
0	found this company through google by chance after being appalled at the prices on the high_st . bought a pair of ray_ban fames and got friendly instant advice over the phone from dragon specs regarding the lenses i needed .
0	they did not instantly advise the most expensive which was refreshing !
0	!
0	vision_express wanted £_000 for the same frame with anti_glare lenses .
0	dragon specs sold the same frames with better lenses for £_00 .
0	saving £_000 .
0	arrived in 00 days .
0	absolutely awesome .
0	would use again , a colleague has already ordered from them and my father is getting his next pair from dragon specs also .
0	you cannot go_wrong with this company .
0	five well_deserved stars !!!!
0	!
0	horror who is fault .
0	i breakdown back in september call the rac .
0	patrol arrived asked me what is the problem after that checking the car identify is my alternator cable loose .
0	he explain that he can fixed no time . after 0_weeks breakdown again call the rac patrol arrived check the battery and told me i need new battery , i explain to him i had same issue 0_weeks_ago and first patrol told me loose connection he was certain it was the battery i did want to purchase battery he did not have the right one .
0	i bought new battery from eurocar parts same is what the rac is using .
0	i had a another breakdown in april call the rac they told me possible alternator he say i need to go garage to get it sorted .
0	i choose a garage .
0	when the garage diagnose the problem guess_what ?
0	my alternator is burned and the cable due loose connection overload .
0	contact the rac customer_care they asked diagnose from garage , battery invoice .
0	i got all the information with in few_days .
0	i received an email requesting those information week after i send them .
0	i called customer_care executive and told_him they got those information over a week after find the emails blame the admin .
0	any way who is fault mine or rac ?
0	they not taking any responsibility they believe they diagnose correct even first patrol put on the report battery good .
0	by the way i forget the mention alternator was only 00 months old .
0	you make your own judgment .
0	once my contract is finish i am out from this company and will not be back been a member 0 years which means nothing for them .
0	i order an item on saturday and delivery is on is way monday .
0	i asked question on sunday regarding to pruduct and answered monday_morning 0 :_00am .
0	i believe very efficient at the moment no issues at all .
0	would i make a purchase from this company ?
0	answer is definitely .
0	thanks again for quick response and delivery .
0	great vendor with an added personal_touch
0	great prices , great support and great products .
0	would definitely use again !
0	used this company many of times never had a problem with them 0_star_rating all day long
0	without_any doubt , i recommend this to everyone out there
0	i ordered numerous items at 00pm .
0	i received an email by 0pm to say it had been sent then received it the next_day all correct and packaged great .
0	nice little touch with the surprise after opening the box .
0	i will be ordering again from them soon to complete the great beginners shaving set they put_together .
0	i could not of possible received the item any faster .
0	i received it in perfect_condition and at a great price .
0	i will use them as my first_port of call for my technology needs .
0	keep_up the great work guys !
0	i decided to order from you after_reading about your history and customer orientation .
0	my order was correct and came quickly .
0	the descriptions of the products was accurate and i am already_planning on making a second purchase in the near_future .
0	the only improvement i can think of is to allow payments with paypal .
0	if all goes well speckyfoureyes may be fine , but you ' re in trouble if you complain or want a refund .
0	ordered frames and lenses from them , but found order status_updates to be inconsistent .
0	the lenses also took well over the supposed 0 - 00 days .
0	so , when i got my glasses and found a mark on the frames i returned them requesting a refund rather_than a replacement .
0	four weeks after speckyfoureyes had received my returned glasses a replacement pair was delivered to me .
0	in the intervening weeks i ' d sent a number of e_- mails to speckyfoureyes asking about the status of my refund .
0	most went_unanswered , some got a reply promising to looking into the matter .
0	i was never told a replacement pair was being sent .
0	since then i '_ve tried numerous e_- mails and phone_calls to ask why my refund request was ignored .
0	mostly i '_ve been ignored again , although i was offered a 00_%_off code in compensation for the original faulty frames - absolutely_useless and misses the point of my complaint entirely .
0	i have never_experienced such poor customer service before .
0	that says it all really .
0	the original sign arrived in a damaged condition .
0	after_contacting them they immediately organised a replacement which has just arrived in perfect_condition .
0	thanks .
0	living in the highlands always means waiting extra days for deliveries .
0	but i ordered my netbook and recieved it in less_than 00_hours !
0	product and service has_been faultless .
0	will order from gogodigital again
0	i made an order for 0gb of ddr0 for my dell_dimension_0000 to be delivered to my girlfriends address ( different from card_holder address ).
0	they phoned up later on in the day to check if it was myself that placed the order for security_reasons .
0	very friendly chap on the phone and incredibly fast delivery for christmas time .
0	thank_you mrmemory i will be buying all my ram from you guys in the future
0	very impressed with the service from cjs_cd_keys .
0	got a bargain on xbox_live_gold_membership and received the code instantly .
0	will be using them again in future .
0	for several_years i started mak bookin online .
0	i have used other_sites before , but since i found out hostelbookers . com i realized that this site is the best .
0	the reservation is easy and fast , i have no_problems then .
0	definitely a site to trust without_hesitation !
0	i don_'_t write_reviews very often but just felt i had to on this occasion .
0	i have only been using tpw for a couple of weeks now but have already put in two orders in that time .
0	in my first order i picked_up 0 sample protein bottles all different_flavours and a 000g bag of whey .
0	one week_later i was ordering more with one problem i loved all 0 flavours , l have tried many brands over the years and its easy to get board with the bland flavour , but tpw is different , gr0 tast , verry easy to mix , and extremely fast delivery .
0	i will be recommending them to friend s and family and will be a happy returning customer .
0	cheers michael bianco
0	i am fascinated by the great help they have been in getting an appointment and processing my marriage visa application .
0	i have been impressed at the speed they work at and mr tanwar was a fabulous solicitor and he knew every_aspect of the application so everything_went well with ease and had felt_comfortable in working with them .
0	had a wonderful experience with them and their company .
0	hope to see them soon and best of luck for their future .
0	this is the best site for supplements , they have what i need in stock .
0	i also love the price match that is amazing .
0	recommend to friends and family .
0	checked out on paypal and received my key swiftly via_autokey .
0	would recommend
0	un sitio con_una interfaz amigable , forma de pago eficiente y una gran cantidad de lugares por elegir ..... que mas se_puede pedir ?
0	glasses are a fraction of the cost of high_street retailers , would recommend this company to anyone looking to buy glasses online .
0	fast delivery at xmas time , for an office quality ups .
0	no doubt is one of the best and cheapest places to get brand_name high_quality supplements .
0	i '_ve ordered many_times from supplement_warehouse and have never been disappointed .
0	after recently going on a fishing holiday and falling in , i desperately_needed to get my iphone fixed that was in my pocket when i got wet !
0	i went on my repair_centre and booked my iphone in for a repair adding the message of it being an_urgent matter .
0	to my disbelief , i received the phone back 0 days after i posted it , fixed and fully working !
0	i was astonished at the turn_around time and even more happy with the customer service i received when i called them the day after_posting it .
0	a big_thumbs_up to this company , much more efficient and friendly than others i have dealt_with in the past .
0	cheers ,
0	ethan p
0	stumbled_across cjs_cd_keys by_accident when the code site i normally use was out of stock and i was very happy that i did .
0	account took a minute or so to set_up and the text verification helps to put your mind at ease , plus the code was delivered within about 00 seconds of verification .
0	i was so happy with the service i recommended cjs to a friend the same day .
0	as an untrusting , paranoid cynic , i ' d read_reviews and looked at the small_print .
0	other_websites quoted various percentage deductions based on the phones condition .
0	mine was in reasonable condition , but had its fair_share of scratches .
0	mazuma_mobile was straight_forward , honest with price and fast with the payment .
0	faultless .
0	this is literally the best i was a skeptic thinking this is not true i searched for my products far and wide .
0	found this baby out and will never trust other stores anymore .
0	this is a must and must recommend to all my friends cause this is it the one i '_ve been searching for supplement_ware_house oh how i love you .
0	very good service and for a reasonable price .
0	better_than sending to apple for a repair and much_better_than having insurance .
0	the prices are the best - even cheaper_than amazon !
0	very pleased with the service provided - the key came through in minutes and i was playing the game soon after .
0	definitely recommended !
0	have had my eyes set on a pair of ray_bans for a while now .
0	the price on sunglasses_shop was a lot lower_than the high_street , so it made sense to go online .
0	i placed the order at 00 : 00 on a monday and the ups man rang my bell at 00 : 00 on tuesday - this is what i call service !
0	i posted my phone on saturday_afternoon and got the money for it on monday_morning .
0	they also offered the highest amount for it , so couldn_'_t have chosen a better company !
0	i '_ve been buying contact_lenses from feel good contact_lenses for a number of years_now and have always had excellent service .
0	i wish all internet shops were like them !
0	ordered flowers online from iflorist nothing showed up , they offered another redelivery and voucher but still dissapointed
0	typed in handset details and got an instant_quote , bag came a couple of days_later - in it goes and bye_bye .
0	money in my account almost the next working day .
0	easy , reliable - able to track throughout .
0	do not use dpd !
0	dpd are hands_down , the most unreliable delivery company in the uk .
0	i have lost two_days work waiting for deliveries that never arrived .
0	on their online parcel - tracker , it claims i ' refused ' the delivery and therefore the package has_been returned to the sender .
0	this is obviously complete nonsense .
0	i have read similar reports all over the internet and find it baffling that so many retailers still use this terrible company for their deliveries .
0	avoid at all costs .

0	i didn_'_t realize how far in advance you had to book a hostel or hotel_room in germany .
0	i thought for sure that 0_weeks was enough .
0	but i didn_'_t have any luck until i stumbled_across hostelbookers and found a hostel that had 0 beds left so i snagged them .
0	it was quick and easy and i would recommend it to anyone .
0	this is quality and i love it .
0	quick , cheap and great product !
0	item arrived within 00_hours of order and i was kept_informed at all times .
0	that '_s basically what you want as a consumer .
0	great fresh flowers every time !
0	plus the delivery has never_let_me down after using these twice_now !
0	would definately recommend .
0	brightest light i have seen yet !
0	i now have this on my bars and mj - 000 on my helmet .
0	everyone can see me coming !
0	bought from these_guys received it within 00_hours .
0	brilliant
0	an easy - to - use system that involved no_hassle .
0	good prices and good concept - would use again .
0	i looked through endless websites trying to find a cheap deal to france which was really stressful .
0	ferrysavers had all available fares in one place making the process a lot_easier .
0	i ended_up choosing myferrylink who i had never_heard of before , but the journey was good enough for me given the good price .
0	hello .
0	i used these before when buying my fifa_00 key however when it came to buying from them again via recommendation from my best friend i waited a total of 00_hrs .
0	i submitted a support_ticket and also posted on their facebook after 0_hr of waiting .
0	i then looked at their latest orders and noticed loads of fifa00 keys being instantly delivered .
0	they were not sold out , so why did my key take nearly 0 whole days to arrive ?
0	i got a reply to my ticket some 00_hrs later simply saying , provide proof .
0	so i did i provided all my paypal info .
0	then a whole day later another reply which said " order approved ".
0	now i want to know were the hell is your customer service skills ?
0	you say a total of 0 words in a 0 day period , not even an attempt at providing an excuse or genuine explanation as to what went wrong .
0	this is what happens when companies get trusted too much , they take liberties and their passion for customer_services goes down the tube !
0	i will never be using this company again !
0	gtxgaming has_been easily the most helpful gsp i ’ ve ever had !
0	they truly are on the same page as the gamers , they tackle any_issues so fast and easily , these_guys at gtx are the real deal .
0	easily the one gsp that deserves to explode onto the scene , they are the hidden_gem .
0	if you ’ re looking for a great gsp , look no furthur .
0	the site always has great deals and some more options once you get to your cart .
0	always have handy things given out for free or for extremely cheap .
0	the competitor feature is also really nice , i '_ve saved several dollars here and there in a matter of seconds .
0	they missed the collection date , then when i rang up to find out why , they had no answers , by the looks of the tracking the order had not even gone_through to the courier .
0	all they could offer was to collect the item another 0 days_later , which was 0 days after i placed the order - even then could not guarantee it was going to be picked_up .
0	i asked for a refund and the phone operator took on an attitude .
0	total_disgrace !
0	bought some armani glasses on 0 / 00 / 00 .
0	finally recieved an email on the 00 / 00 / 00 saying they have been dispatched - from_hong_kong !
0	!
0	customs added £_00 in charges for my glasses to be released and delivered .
0	beware as they mention eu distribution centres and have a uk number , but no one answers the phone and after sales service is terrible .
0	after paying the customs_charges , the price worked out about the same as buying from a uk company - plus all the inconvenience and delay in getting my glasses .
0	i decided not to pay the charges and filed a dispute with paypal for a full_refund .
0	beware they do not state vat on their website when making an order , so they are covered if you complain .
0	this is our second website to be built by visualsoft , they have incredible sysyems in place to ensure everything runs like_clockwork including very competent staff who clearly have love and a passion for what they do .
0	i would recommend visualsoft for anyone looking to break into the e_- commerce market or a complete_overhaul of an existing website .
0	* edit to add ...* far too many 0_star / 0 review for this company .
0	trust_pilot should investigate .
0	if they spent as much time woking on their service as they do bombing social_media sites ,, they might have a good company .
0	also , either they ' re incredibly racist employers , or they do not give their staff the dignity to enable them to use their real name .
0	has anyone spoken with someone on live_chat that didn_'_t have a biblical ' white ' name ?!
0	all hints at what a sneaky , deceitful company this really is .
0	following a number of bookings for supposed ' next_day ' service , with such a low collection rate ( from collections in central_london - hardly the outer_hebrides !)
0	it is clear this company easily maintains it '_s ' low ' rates by simply only managing to complete x % of the collections .
0	it '_s clear when you phone to complain ( after_realising that the obvious move of allocating your failed collection to the following days service isn_'_t automatically done !)
0	they clearly know and expect such a regular_occurrence to be part of their business .
0	their review %' s are disingenuous ( almost laughable ) and simply an example of the fraudulent practices of this company .
0	i shall be reporting them to trading_standards as they are deliberately overstating their abilities .
0	do not use !
0	absolute_joke of a company , there customer service is none_existant , rediculous live_chat system allows them to disconnect the chat whenever they dont like what you have to say .
0	i asked 0 times to actually speak to a manager and was told they could not give me their numbers out , so i asked for the email address of the md and i was told he did not have one .
0	asked for a refund .......... got no response , asked for tracking_details ........ no response .
0	i really do hate this company and i will be so glad when i read that they have gone to the wall .
0	surely not long away now
0	i made an error on my parcel and p0g '_s sarah_hayes helped_me very quickly , best service i have had from anybody at p0g so_far , she is great :)
0	always a first_class service from klm .
0	i have used them over the last 00 years and they have always gone above and beyond .
0	last flight to sa had a disaster with the entertainment_system on my monitor but the crew were attentive and done all they could do .
0	even_though the issue could not be fixed , the crew kept me entertained throughout the flight .
0	gives me the perfect chance to keep_up to date with all my friends all over the world
0	will use again for any gadgets i need .
0	they were extremely_helpful when it came to helping_me choose the telly i needed , and they packaged it up with the leads i needed .
0	very happy :)
0	thank_you mmoga have such a great online support .
0	the web_site is quality every thing are all prices i love this website .
0	i am new to this web and you devlives are top quality .
0	i rate this site 000 out of 000
0	my laptop was stolen from my flat .
0	i had insured it and my phone together a while ago .
0	advisor on the phone was sympathetic and useful .
0	overall im really happy with how it went , they replaced my laptop .
0	if i didnt have the insurance i wouldn_'_t have been able to afford a new one on top of rent and bills so it really saved a huge headache .
0	everything_went very smoothly and they were always there and in contact with me .
0	it does what it '_s supposed to do and does it well .
0	i '_m very pleased and will keep using them .
0	i found jack0d at a great price so i ordered from supplementwarehouse . com !
0	i needed a makita_combi_drill / impact_driver set for work , so i used google_shopping to find the best price on the latest_model available which was the dlx0000m .
0	needless to say i was directed to powertool_world .
0	i ordered the set late one evening and it arrived within one working day , i cannot_fault the service that i have received so well_done to powertool_world !!
0	!
0	came at 00 00 without notice
0	really pleased with my new dslr and lenses .
0	arrived really quickly , cheaper_than anywhere_else and whole_process has_been professional and easy .
0	i will_definatley_use them again .
0	months
0	up to 0 months
0	great cheap prices .
0	delivered instantly and cd_key worked great .
0	probably one of only a handful of safe steam cd_key sellers out there !
0	very quick in delivering the keys after ordering , cheap and very good service
0	when i found out about this website , prices seemed way too good to be true ; having been burned before ( screw you [_external_reference ]), was a bit afraid to buy something ; after_reading all the sites and reviews of it , bought dark_souls 0 as pre order , and was not disappointed ; already received my key and the game is already pre loaded .
0	also bought some other games from them ; awesome site and very good customer_support .
0	very good seller .
0	had some problems with some acessories i ordered , but were prontly resolved with contacting the seller .
0	will buy from them again
0	production_room is a great store full of awesome but competitively_priced gear .
0	the customer service from their staff is second to none .
0	i always make the trip from doncaster to production_room ( leeds ) instead of seeking out audio_equipment locally .
0	00 / 00 will use every time .
0	s . d
0	e_- careers regularly offer " discounted " courses with a limited time remaining to purchase at the lower price .
0	they do this to rush you into purchasing a course which appears to be good value without reading the small_print .
0	however at no point during the multiple_occasions i spoke to them on the phone was i informed that my mcsa server 0000 course did not include the exam ( therefore not being_able to get microsoft certified without having to pay hundreds of pounds extra for the actual exam ).
0	while i realise this is partially my fault for not asking , i have never undertaken an online course and would not expect an online course you pay hundreds of pounds for to have these hidden_costs .
0	upon requesting a refund i was refused because their terms and conditions_state that once a course has_been activated to an account , refunds are not available .
0	fair_enough , but why ?
0	no physical product has_been dispatched to me that would be returned as b - stock that would be understandable .
0	but i do not see why a course cannot be cancelled and removed from an account .
0	their system clearly_states i have been logged in for no more than 0 minutes , definitely not enough time to steal course material .
0	the bottom_line is i am out of work and now out of pocket with the last bit of money i was saving for a course to help me into employment .
0	if the exam was included as they make out all would be well but the fact is i cannot_afford the extra £_000 it will cost me to take the exam to get me back in to work .
0	i am not the first person to leave a negative_review of this company but it seems they respond faster to removing these reviews than they reply to your emails when you have an issue .
0	also a lot of these 0_star reviews look engineered .
0	so please read all small_print in respect to your course before using this company .
0	ensure that the course meets your exact purposes because gaining a refund after the 0 days after your purchase ( in_accordance with the distance trading regulations ) is extremely unlikely .
0	i have used amazon . co . uk for many_years_now and i always find it is the cheapest place to buy things from .
0	there is a good range of delivery options and they have never been late before .
0	no products have never been shipped to me in a bad condition either .
0	i bought a bonfire volt jacket and the product i received has_been in perfect_condition and is of good quality , pretty_much exactly as_described on the website .
0	i would recommend both the jacket and the seller .
0	bought a gaming_pc from here recently , i ordered it on monday and it got to me on thursday .
0	the pc was the cheapest i could_find on the internet and the delivery was cheap and good .
0	the pc arrived in awesome packaging and nothing was damaged .
0	i set my pc up and there was a slight_problem with the fan ( it was making a loud noise ) so i rang customer_support and someone talked_me through the process of fixing it and it is now fixed .
0	excellent service , i would recommend dinopc to anyone and will be definitely buying from here again .
0	amazing !
0	i heard of these_guys from a friend , and he said they ' d be the best .
0	he was not mistaken .
0	i have now dealt_with them for a long time and i love everything about them .
0	from the samples , to the fast shipping - they will not let you down .
0	i '_m a customer for life !
0	ordered a new mic and stand and some cables and all got to my door working 00hrs and the shipping only cost me a fiver .
0	you can '_t ask for more .
0	plus it '_s the cheapest place i '_ve found for the akg d0 vocal mic ( which as far as i '_m concerned is gonna take over from the sm00 as the mic ) at £_00 it '_s over £_00 cheaper_than ne nearest_rival and even ebay !!
0	i will and have recommended this company to others and will be using them for all my live sound needs from now on
0	i bought the amplifier at a great price , and although i found myself with a technical difficulty on arrival , that was due to my lack of inexperience .
0	hifi - tower emailed me back within a day or so and i was sorted !
0	0 / 0 for price / quality and speed of delivery !
0	dealing_with sammie is always so easy as she knows what shes doing and susses the problems out instantly very good service thank_you craig
0	i just wanted to say a big thank_you to aerial_installation direct for their great service .
0	we recently decided that we wanted to upgrade from freeview tv to sky digital .
0	we were going to call sky themselves until a friend of ours told us about a family run business they had used in the past when they wanted a new digital aerial .
0	we called aerial_installation direct and the guy on the phone was very friendly .
0	he asked which of the systems we wanted , we didn_'_t even know there was such a choice .
0	he explained that the sky_hd plus system would let us record and watch channels in hd and that '_s just what we wanted .
0	we arranged for someone to come and install the system and i was surprised that we didn_'_t have to wait for weeks , just a couple of days on the installation date the guys were very friendly but professional , which put us at ease .
0	he asked us where we wanted the satellite_dish installed .
0	we hadn_'_t thought about this , we just assumed that he would put it where he wanted .
0	our neighbors have sky and they had to have their dishes on the front of their homes , which looks horrible .
0	we asked if we could have our dish at the back of the house and he said , no problem .
0	our satellite was installed very quickly on a pole and bracket , out of sight at the back , to the envy of our neighbours .
0	the guys from aerial_installation direct installed the set top box in the living_room and then went out of their way to explain how the system worked after setting it up for us and testing it .
0	me and my husband are not really into technical things , we are both in our 00s , but we found it easy to use thanks to his explanations , which he went over more than once .
0	if you are considering having a system installed i would recommend aerial_installation direct to anyone .
0	as a small plumber ’_s business in bristol we didn_’_t think we needed a website , but i couldn ’_t have been more wrong !
0	we ’ ve only got a 0 page website , but it ’_s now giving us lots of enquiries and business !
0	if you think you don_’_t need a website then think again .
0	our customers are finding us on their mobile_phones and on their computers as well as the traditional methods .
0	really pleased and will_continue to use sean and his_team !
0	i get my mattress next_day after order .
0	very pleased with good and service i received .
0	these are the gurus very very satisfied . they deliver
0	i found the person ( cormac ) i dealt_with very help , especially as i did not have a clue , as to what i was talking_about , having never purchased alloy_wheel before , he also telephone back to make_sure that i have found the right size and fitment for my peugeot .

0	00 days to deliver tyres .
0	no word from customer_services unless i harassed them .
0	they had to order them in twice and then refused to deliver them any sooner_than 0 days_later .
0	i hate wasting my time , unhelpful customer service !
0	i received my items within a day , exactly_what they said they were and i '_m overall extremely happy
0	ordered and turned_up in no time .
0	cannot not rate high .
0	happy to add my stamp of approval .
0	we love this site .
0	it '_s user - friendly with the exact reviews we hope to find in searching out hostels .
0	we appreciate the good and bad_reviews , ratings , the pictures and quick - read room descriptions .
0	comparing each hostel was so easy .
0	we quickly navigated the site with its awesome prompts and found the hostels that looked most attractive to our situation .
0	i really liked the simple , straightforward formatting of travel itinerary followed_by the variety of hostel options accompanied_by short description blurbs , obvious pricing , pictures and availability .
0	overall , we ' re just grateful we searched with hostelbookers .
0	we ' re excited for our trip .
0	bon_voyage to others too !
0	after waiting 0 months for delivery of my pc from another supplier pc_specialist were a breath of fresh_air .
0	good sales advice , excellent communication and a pc that is bang on spec .
0	well_done .
0	well i ordered gta comlete pack for steam that was supposed to be all the games released for pc , used the code and it was only gta iv and liberty city stories not what it said in the listing and now the listing has_been corrected but still has the same picture , i have taken out 0 tickets one just got closed for no reason at all and the second was marked as solved after i asked them what i was to take a screenshot of , use this company at your own_risk !!!!!
0	!
0	i love this company and stand by them 000_%.
0	i have made many purchases and only once had an issue but the staff rectified it immediately
0	i have ordered many outdoor items from many different stores online before and have to say webtog is one of the top stores .
0	i ordered a jetboil 0 . 0ltr pan and the price was very very competitive .
0	may i also say i ordered this on wednesday_night 00 / 00 / 00 and it was delivered new years_eve ( even with postal delays !!)
0	delivery was free so you tend to think a week would be fair but 0 days is very swift .
0	the product was well_packaged and protected as well .
0	many_thanks to webtog
0	i ordered my watch a few_days before_christmas , it arrived earlier_than_expected in chamonix , france .
0	great service , i ' d use them again without_hestitation .
0	ben mason .
0	there are many choices of quality baubles available at good prices .
0	purchased the silver and red 00mm packs of 00 .
0	comes well_packaged , would use again .
0	great prices and easy website to use .
0	would use again
0	this is without_doubt the worst provider i have ever had the displeasure of dealing_with , they are incompetent beyond imagination , so much of my time and money wasted on them , do not get lured by their bundle_deals , the amount of time you will have to waste on them will not repay you of any minor savings you may make
0	good prices and good selection of supplements
0	i bought a defective tag_heuer carrera gmt caliber 0 automatic watch from swiss_watch direct on october_0000 .
0	the reference_number of the watch is war0000 . fc0000 .
0	but there are two obvious blemishes under the glass .
0	and they admitted the blemishes .
0	so i required a full_refund because this is within 0 working_days and all the problems are caused_by the seller .
0	but they donnot want to give me a full_refund , they asked me to afford a new strap which is used only seversl days .
0	they even let_me afford 000_pounds but ascually the strap is only worth about 000_pounds .
0	after a dicker , they finally let_me afford 000_pounds and keep the former strap in their shop .
0	by the way , i also paid 00 pouns for the return postage .
0	because this is a defective watch and it is within 0 working_days , i think i should get a full_refund .
0	but they actually let_me loss 000_pounds totally .
0	i cannot_believe this unreliable shop anymore .
0	now they list the return watch in stock with 0000 pounds within only one day after they received it .
0	i think maybe they are not going to replace the former strap .
0	so the seller just reduce 000_pounds and also keep a 00 . 00_% new strap ( worth 000_pounds ) and detain my 000_pounds .
0	so finally the seller earned extra 000_pounds from this return even the return is caused_by the problems themselves .
0	everyone who_wants to buy expensive luxury watches from swiss_watch direct should consider carsfully before you deciding to pay for them .
0	this is my sincerely advise after this painful experience from the swiss_watch direct .
0	one star_rating is the highest rating i can give them as i really want to give them zero_star_rating because of this very very painful experience !!!!!!!!!
0	!
0	the service of iconic_watches is very good and they are all very patient .
0	my experience of this purchase is excellent .
0	recommand it !
0	!
0	brought a ritchey wcs carbon one bolt seat post £_00 with postage bargin no where else is it this cheap and to top that it was sent recorded and arrived the next_morning i only ordered at 0pm the day before woow thank_you cycle_store im well and trully happy and wish all other_retailers were this good .
0	nightgear has a full range of kit from many different companies , offering the buyer a wide_selection and at a competitive price .
0	customer service are very friendly , reply promptly to questions and do everything they can to help .
0	deliveries are always well_packaged and on time .
0	would recommend to anyone in military , law enforcement or emergency services , or civilians who just want decent kit that is made to last , for whatever your needs .
0	first time buying from this company and all i can say is the prices are competitive ( for what i was after atleast ) and their standard delivery was ridiculously quick !
0	ordered roughly 00am on thursday , items arrived around 0pm - ish friday ....
0	no issues , no_hassle .
0	absolutely perfect , would have no issue ordering from them again !
0	have used heinnie across roughly the last 0 years and the service has_been continually great .

0	overall very happy and would recommend them .
0	first time using this company and can_honestly_say im extremely impressed !
0	great range of stock , highly competitive_prices and speedy delivery !
0	definitely would not_hesitate to buy from outdoorgb again !
0	recommended to anyone looking for a good price , quick turn_around and allround quality service .
0	thanks outdoorgb
0	great company , couldn_'_t fault them in any way .
0	this was my first purchase with them and it was an extremely pleasant_experience so i am sure to be returning !
0	thanks to all the other positives reviews i was pointed towards this great store !
0	i can consider myself lucky to have found this website .
0	ordered items on monday and on the following_day i was using my computers with the upgraded memory !
0	excellent is the least i can say !
0	well_done !
0	the team were very quick to answer any questions i had and the pc itself was built and tested very quick just a shame i ordered it just before_christmas as i didnt get it till after new year , but that was my fault .
0	it is an_absolute machine !
0	it plays all the games i want it to play ie skyrim and cod perfectly doesnt even flinch !!
0	does not get hot stays at around 00_degrees celsius , overall am very happy with the pc
0	astonishingly quick purchase , yet again !
0	ordered payday 0 and a few moment later my key was downloading in steam .
0	brilliant !
0	will_definitely use them again !
0	after using other software and tethered jailbreaks / unlocks , i went to gevey to use my at & t iphone 0 on a t - mobile plan ... it was fine , i suppose , but so tedious !
0	i was always afraid of updating my iphone for fear of updating the baseband .
0	finally , i have a real solution .
0	i used holiday_autos after_reading a review in moneysavingexpert .
0	the site was very easy to navigate , got a great deal on a hire car for a week and there excess_insurance saved me a pretty penny too .
0	follow the instructions and make_sure to print your rental voucher out before you go .
0	i will_definitely use them again .
0	best keys site ive came_across very fast and efficient yet secure
0	living local to box '_s birmingham shop / warehouse means i often visit the store to purchase and collect items .
0	the staff are friendly & courteous , the prices competetive and availability good .
0	my only_gripe is that the website often contains a lot of items that are not available for immediate collection / dispatch .
0	not serious enough to knock off a * but worthy of note nonetheless .
0	interparcel offers a fantastic service and is a worthy alternative to the usual royal_mail services for anything from small_packet size upwards .
0	the site is easy to use and takes the hassle out of having an account with one of the couriers directly .
0	highly_recommended if you post anything .
0	sammie was great at helping_me and done everything i expected an advisor to do :)
0	nothing more to say ...
0	so i love to travel , to eat , and to share experiences with people .
0	hosstel bookers makes that possible for me .
0	they give me a full list of everything i need to know for a ton of places to stay in the city i am going .
0	i love that they have a lot of reviews of the hostels and hotels , so i can figure_out if the walls are too thin to sleep , if the breakfast is good , and what others think of the hostel .
0	its a really great site and the only one i use .
0	on top of that , there is no booking_fee , so unlike_other_sites there is no 00_% extra .
0	use it .
0	i have now ordered a few sold out tickets from double0_tickets and have never failed to be impressed with their service .
0	i would thoroughly_recommend using this company to anyone who is looking to buy tickets to sold out events .
0	at first , hostelbookers struck me as any other booking website , but after being given a varied_selection on quite a remote_location i was happy to say that i ' d probably be booking all my other hostels on my 00 week holiday with this company .
0	after choosing an accomodation , i was subject to finding out i didn_'_t even have to pay the full_amount which allowed the flexibility of cancelling and not having to squabble over getting a full_refund on the total price .
0	the actually booking process was very quick and efficient and i would definitely be recommending this company to others and using it for future holidays .
0	great service .
0	problem_solved in less_than 0 minutes would recommend this company to anyone .
0	delivered on time and does the job
0	thanks for good service and stuffs ;)
0	good service and same i can told about items . many_thanks .
0	i thought they used an excellent courier service , because it specified which hour the boots were going to arrive .
0	thanks !
0	sounds similar to previous poster ...
0	i booked a transfer from lanzarote arrecife .
0	i arrived and was told that there was no record of booking .
0	told me that if i took a taxi then it would be refunded by central office .
0	paid 00_euros for a taxi now they say they will only refund cost of my booking ie 0 euros .
0	so annoyed as i would have booked another shuttle_bus if they had not been able to do it .
0	wasted 00_euros because they didn_'_t communicate my booking to the local agent .
0	avoid .
0	bit_dubious beforehand about using a stag company but chillisauce were the business .
0	tailored a trip to hamburg to our needs and provided some great advice .
0	nothing_worse than hanging_around for airport_transfers and they were bang on time if not early .
0	accommodation was even better_than_expected - really excellent value .
0	and the nighttime destinations were ideal .
0	best thing about chillisauce was the flexibility to have a couple of dropouts , which is more or less inevitable when organising a bunch of reprobates .
0	great service from sarah_h and the team .
0	would definitely recommend and use again !
0	cheers chillisauce
0	great service !
0	- speedy delivery
0	i understand not everyone has had the same experience but for my holiday to turkey with the girlfriend everything was done very well .
0	flights were on time and had no issues with anything in the airport , was as relaxing as possibly could be .
0	arrived at hotel and it was the best on the strip by far .
0	would use them again and defiantly recommend them to my friends and family !
0	booked a hotel for london for arctic monkeys and was all smooth when arrived with confirmation and their website is easy to use .
0	purchased a box of mini cakes as a corporate gift for a large client of ours and they delivered on time and the feedback was positive .
0	would definitely consider_using them for our other 000 large accounts who we regularly send gifts out to if their pricing was slightly_cheaper .
0	overall a very positive buying experience with clean user_friendly website and a faultless process .
0	i purchased 00 items in total from barrington and there was a couple of issues , one being there fault and one being my fault but both were resolved to an excellent standard and putting the customer first .
0	everything they said they would do they did !
0	will be using them again .
0	cannot argue with their service and professionalism - a0
0	dreadful company do not buy from them !!!!!!
0	arrogant customer service team who do not help you in any way !
0	purchased 0 items from them on saturday and got an email_saying 0 item was out of stock and would be cancelled automatically !
0	i then contacted them to let them know that i could live with that and that they could dispatch the rest of the order which i was they would .
0	i then log on the day after to find the whole order has_been cancelled and the goods were out of stock !
0	i then asked regarding when the refund would be processed i was told 0 - 00 days terrible service !
0	terrible customer_services rep claire and director eric would not even comment on the matter !
0	do not buy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	!
0	it '_s an easy to use website with tons of hostels and great reviews of each and everyone one of them from people like you and me .
0	it makes it easy to weed out the not so good hostel , from the great ones , and ones at great prices .
0	i would highly_recommend this sight to anyone staying in hostels around the world .
0	in the past year i '_ve been screwed twice by play . com .
0	firstly i pre_- ordered a game which promised a " play . com exclusive pre_- order bonus ".
0	as it turned_out , this " bonus " was a cheat code to unlock a character in the game who was already unlockable anyway .
0	game '_s pre_- order bonus was legitimate , in that it provided a code to redeem an otherwise inaccessible character online .
0	there was no means for me to complain_about this .
0	a year later , and i ordered something else for father '_s day .
0	i ordered over a week in advance , and when the package finally arrived two_days after father '_s day , it was a completely_different item .
0	i contacted them and was assured that my actual item would be posted immediately .
0	three_weeks_later , and it still_hasn_'_t even been posted , they refuse to acknowledge me returning the other item ( which is worth less_than what i ordered ), they haven_'_t issued me a refund and their email service is fobbing_me off with automated_responses .
0	do not use this site .
0	i '_ve dealt_with plenty of online stores , and no other provides a service that can compete with shopto .
0	i '_ve made six orders with them over the past few_years because their products are consistently priced lower_than other_sites , and despite the delivery simply being free royal_mail first_class , my package has always arrived the day after_posting , and my order was always posted the same or the next working day .
0	their free_postage is comparable to the high - priced premium postage of places like play . com .
0	you can '_t go_wrong with shopto .
0	flowers speak volumes , for once she was lost for words !
0	blackcircles has a great price range of tyres to suit all pockets .
0	its easy and convenient and you can always pick a date and time to suit your own needs
0	excellent service all_round
0	i bought a blackberry phone through mcdonald '_s employee discount site but i din '_t received my cash_back .
0	wicked site just had a good moan_about minicredit and praised argos .
0	will be passing on this site to everyone i know .
0	if only i ' d came_across this site sooner .
0	hoping there will there be a product review section later ?
0	if a product is faulty or just not want you hoped it was , it ’_s so easy to return and either replace or refund , and there prices are very good to and even better if you catch a half price sale :-) love shopping here .
0	please don_'_t touch this company no matter_how desperate you are !
0	!
0	£_000 loan has now gone up to nearly_£_000 making it impossible to pay .
0	there penalty charges are ridiculously_high and by day 0 of late payment you will not be able to pay the debt !!
0	!
0	they are just legal loan sharks !!
0	!
0	the run up to the stag_do was very good .
0	lots of communication with chillisauce , they facilitated the payments etc which saved me , the best man , a lot of hassle .
0	broadly speaking , the whole stag_do was a success with one exception .
0	we paid for guest_list entry on the friday_night and found that we weren_'_t on the list in some places which frustrated us and had an affect on the fun we were having that night .
0	we complained on the saturday and were told we ' d be added to a club guest_list for saturday_night .
0	again , on arriving at the club , we weren_'_t on the guest_list !!!
0	very frustrating and hence the poor review .
0	firstly i can confirm the company is genuine and trustworthy , so don_'_t have any concerns there .
0	the watch supplied was exactly as ordered with all necessary breitling international warranties .
0	its condition was perfect .
0	i was disappointed that my watch was delayed beyond the maximum stated delivery and i had to chase updates a couple of times .
0	i believe swiss_watches did what they could to chase the order though , delivery to the authorised_dealer appeared to be beyond their control .
0	my other disappointment was that the website states under the watch i ordered that the watch came with a 0 day refund policy , offering me peace of mind if i needed it .
0	when i placed my order i was told my watch was a special order though and therefore wasn_'_t eligible .
0	my watch wasn_'_t anything special , it was a standard breitling aerospace evo .
0	i think the website is misleading and told swiss_watches this but they state the full terms of the refund policy are available online .
0	it wouldn_'_t take them long to update the site so the watches that aren_'_t eligible are listed as such though , so read what you what into the way they present their refund policy .
0	the final price was better_than anywhere on the high_street but maybe not by the margins you ' d expect .
0	don_'_t write off your local official dealer before getting their best quote .
0	i was offered a quote within £_000 of the final price i paid swiss_watches , the watch was in stock and the fitting would have been free .
0	in short it was an acceptable experience and i ' d consider_using them again .
0	i get the impression most people have a better experience than i did from their reviews .
0	just the worst shopping_experience on the high_street .
0	the staff literally couldn_'_t care less in any sports_direct i '_ve been in .
0	the corporate attitude must be contagious .
0	i honestly don_'_t know how this store survives .
0	we went in for trail_running_shoes and no one gave a damn about helping_us .
0	across the road to schuh and the experience couldn_'_t have been more different .
0	i decided once and for all yesterday i will never return to sports_direct .
0	website is always quick and simple to use .
0	search_functions works brilliant and returns relevant results .
0	range of stock and stock_levels were good .
0	prices aren_'_t the cheapest but i '_m happy to pay a bit more for a good service , which is what barrington_sports provide .
0	free courier delivery is excellent ( although linked to a minimum order size i believe ).
0	used these for the 0st time and i cannot_fault the services or the price of the tyres .
0	spotted low tyre pressure on the weds_evening and verified it thursday_morning .
0	i rang round and checked prices online and tyres on the drive where by far the cheapest .

0	hi ,
0	you need to audit who you allow to list through trivago , specifically amoma . com
0	i went_onto trivago several weeks_ago and booked the premier_inn , haymarket through an agency amoma . com paid the balance in full upfront and left it till the weekend to make use of it .
0	however , when i arrived at the hotel at circa 0 :_00pm , there was no reservation made for me that weekend , and they had no rooms free , which prompted panic stations as i hadn_'_t made a back up plan .
0	after much discussion with the reception_desk they were able to find a room for the first night , but i would have to pay for it and they definitely didn_'_t have a room for the second night .
0	after wasting over 00_minutes on hold to get through to amoma . com i finally got speaking to customer ( service ) who informed me that their supplier had let them down and it wasn_'_t their fault ..
0	i handed the phone with their customer service agent to the hotel manager and they had a discussion , much to my alarm i was not the only individual that weekend who had attempted to use but two other groups of people had used amoma . com for this stay in the premier_inn haymarket and were in the same predicament .
0	i was promised a call back to resolve the situation , which i never received .
0	i spent the next hour ringing hotels in edinburgh trying to find a hotel for the weekend , but had no joy as the edinburgh marathon was taking place on the sunday and they were all booked up .
0	on the saturday_morning i checked in with the reception_desk and to my joy , a room had become_available through cancellation and i could have it however i would need to pay £_000 to secure it .
0	again i called amoma . com and spoke with another customer service representative who again promised to call me back , as per previous experience i received no call back .
0	the very least i am expecting is a full_refund to compensate me for the inconvenience and stress suffered by their incompetence , so_far they have offered me a £_00 refund for inconvenience , which as you can guess i have not accepted .
0	randomly ended_up on blaze from a google_search , and it turned_out to be the best value for money , and best of all , right here in the uk !

0	i have used printerland twice_now and have been pleased both_times with their level of service .
0	items are always delivered the very next_day and the prices are extremely competitive .
0	the website is extremely easy to use and gave all the exact information i needed when comparing possible printers and the staff are always helpful when required .
0	i will be recommending printerland to anyone who needs a printer or consumables .
0	i '_ll definately be back myself !
0	i chose 000 - reg because they are simple , fast and affordable .
0	i was originally a godaddy customer using there standard vps package costing over £_00 \ month for a basic single - tier 0gb_ram 0x core , 0tb bandwidth , 000gb server .
0	having several problems with godaddy , with server downtimes , firewall blocking issues .
0	i decided it was time to see what the rest of the market had to offer , where i stumbled_upon 000 - reg .
0	i have used 000 - reg in the past for simple cheap domain_registration , and what they offered for a basic vps was simply outstanding :
0	- 0gb_ram
0	- unlimited bandwidth
0	- 0 cpu cores
0	- plesk addon included in the price
0	- included static_ip_address
0	all for £_00 . 00
0	i couldn_'_t resist and instantly ordered it .
0	within 0 hours the vps was available and ready to use .
0	despite minor connection and server issues , i have never had as many problems using 000 - reg compared to godaddy .
0	there help and support has always been mostly helpful and within a decent response time .
0	unlike go daddy , was impossible to get hold of , i would have to wait 0 / 0 of a day to talk to someone about a simple problem .
0	really pleased with my supra sofa_bed , excellent service and really quick delivery .
0	thank_you !
0	shoes arrived promptly and as_described .
0	would recommend the site !
0	i have had problem after problem with scottish_power ....
0	my electric meter broke so i called them in september asking them to fix it .
0	they said they would send someone out the following week to replace the meter .
0	that person didn_'_t turn_up .
0	i got back in touch and arranged for another callout to replace the meter .
0	again , i had to book time off work but this time , someone did attend .
0	sadly , he simply looked at the meter and agreed that it was broken and then left .
0	he admitted that it was ridiculous and said that most customers were unhappy with this process but that the decision was obviously made above him .
0	he said the metering team would be back in touch .
0	i was also given an email address for them as to call , i ' d have to go through various_departments first ....
0	when they didn_'_t get back in touch ( surprise_surprise !
0	), i emailed them and they agreed an appointment for which no - one arrived .
0	since then , i have emailed 0 times ( all of which were automatically acknowledged saying they would respond within 0 working_days ) and i have had no response to any of them .
0	they have now increased my bill , have given me a higher estimated usage than normal and have sent a threatening_letter demanding payment but still will not respond to any questions_regarding my meter !
0	i chose scottish_power because they were the cheapest on a comparison site .
0	a few_months on and they are now one of the most expensive .
0	never go with scottish_power !
0	learn from my mistakes !
0	i used this company for a while although i was never thrilled with the service .
0	the sales_team are quite pushy and say there is a minimum of 0 hours for a two bed flat which is more than i wanted , but went with it .
0	i recently received an email offering a one of 0 hour service for £_00 but when i called they said my post_code wasn_'_t eligible .
0	the cleaning was generally ok but never great value and the first cleaner broke part of my shower and didn_'_t mention it .
0	edit_: i '_ve since been contacted by fantastic cleaners who have apologised and insisted they will amend the marketing and not repeat this mistake .
0	after using parcels to go for some time , we have changed business premises , we were unable to book collections at our new address due to something that happened back a few_years_ago before we moved in , i have been in contact with the company before this time and was advised that they could not collect from out area , i have chatted today with emma , and she has managed to arrange our new address to be able to have collections again , which will now save us money on collection charges !!..
0	she went above and beyond her duty to help me and was also very helpful ..
0	thanks you emma , you have made my day !
0	the guy i spoke with cormac , was really helpful , i ' d spent the day ringing companies always to find they had no stock or it would take 0_weeks to get what i wanted , but time was against me , cormac went and checked everything they had in that would be the right fit for my car gave_me a list of them straight to my email and made it much_easier to choose .
0	in the end i went for the fox racing fx000 .
0	ordered on the wednesday arrived on friday .
0	would recommend to any of my friends .
0	thanks performance_alloys .
0	used this service on new years_eve .
0	was skeptical at first about the whole service and the 0 hour activation time .
0	but it worked like a charm .
0	highly_recommended !
0	gave_us a honest review of the current condition of the car , and great talking with jason .
0	will do_business with them again .
0	go there , buy the service , boom , you have you iphone_unlocked .
0	i '_ve ordered 0 bikes from them in the last 0 months .
0	the first goes like a dream , but has now left my care for that of my father .
0	i ordered a second , bigger , bike which was to be delivered by yodel ( who are the worst yet most widespread carrier ).
0	yodel , being incompetent have ( unsurprisingly ) badly fumbled the delivery .
0	i contacted bikes0u to enquire_about a resolution to allow us to bypass yodel .
0	within 00_minutes , they phoned me , explained the situation and we worked out a resolution .
0	top_notch service all_round .
0	on the one hand , they have all the bike parts i '_ll ever need and the staff are always helpful and willing to part with a little advice on bike maintenance .
0	on the other , trying to get them to do work on the bike themselves is an_absolute chore .
0	long waiting times despite nearly empty schedules and the work is too often of questionable quality .
0	one particular example is when i took my bike in for a yearly once - over ( i do regular maintenance myself ) and they replaced my chain .
0	that night , cycling home from work , the chain snapped in the middle of a busy junction .
0	i always used to love going into game .
0	they always had what i wanted and the staff knew their stuff .
0	of late , however , they '_ve been slipping badly , with poor availability and damaged stock .
0	this was best highlighted when the cancelled all mass_effect pre_- orders shortly before release .
0	even worse , they deposit was refunded only as store credit .
0	the staff are always friendly , helpful and smiling .
0	and the food , while a little dearer , beats other supermarkets hands_down .
0	especially the bread .
0	having paid for next_day delivery , i was unimpressed when they failed to deliver the next_day , or the day after , or the day after ....
0	when i phone to track it , the call_centre in manchester has none of the numbers needed to actually put you through to people who might help , and the website is no help either .
0	out of 00 deliveries they '_ve handled , only 0 showed up on time .
0	they also lost one and broke another .
0	in my opinion , stick to <_external link_removed_> services .
0	i ordered some whey_protein off of this website for the first time .
0	it was exactly_what i ordered and not only was i satisfied with my product , but i got other free things for only the price of shipping .
0	supplement_warehouse is a great site
0	yet another bad review of this astonishingly incompetent company ( formally hdnl for anyone who_sees a pattern emerging ).
0	i have had the unfortunate experience of having 0 parcels delivered by yodel and only one has_been delivered the first time .
0	two more have been missed once and had to be redelivered and the latest has_been missed twice .
0	i have deliveries for work ( self_employed ) 0 - 0 times a week from other_companies and i never miss a single one .
0	the reason for this is that yodel for some reason seem to think it is acceptable to deliver at 0000 everytime when usually nobody can be there .
0	some common_sense would flag that up as needing to be delivered at a different time .
0	speaking of times , their possible delivery hours are 0000 to 0000 . who can be in for that period of time ?
0	it '_s ... ridiculous .
0	they don_'_t even do you the courtesy of telling you whether it will be morning , afternoon or evening .
0	the cards they leave ( if they bother to leave one at all ) are always virtually blank with perhaps a cross in the boxed marked " we tried to deliver " ( no , really ?
0	i couldn_'_t work that out from the card you left and the fact i was expecting a delivery ).
0	there was a telephone_number left on the latest card which i have tried to ring to no_avail because it '_s either off or flips to voicemail .
0	after_reading about other people '_s experience with yodel i '_m very hesitant to ring the call_centre as i '_m afraid what might happen to my parcel if i do !
0	after ditching my old web developers who couldn_'_t give a crap about your site , or any particular deadline i was recommended to gocreations by one of my friends .
0	i have to say i haven_'_t looked back since .
0	they are always friendly , understanding and have always been able to complete projects on time and never over the inital cost that is agreed upon .
0	their web_hosting has_been very reliable so_far and extremely cost_effective when compared with some others .
0	if you ' re looking for a company to trust with your developent then you '_ve found it .
0	after running my website for a couple of years and finding trustpilot for my own business i think i should leave a review about the company who made my website ( well , half of it anyway ).
0	i contacted them about a site , sent over some pretty specific layout information and graphics and told them in no uncertain_terms what my budget for the project was and that it was basically an_absolute figure .
0	the person i initially contacted was nice enough , fairly professional , and told me " we can make the site for you in two_weeks ."
0	two_weeks after they started they sent me a link to the store on their server and it looked like maybe an afternoon '_s work had been put into it .
0	very few things were where they were supposed to be and a few things that i had been told looked fine on the design were now " added_extras " which would incur extra_charges to fix .
0	what could i do but pay them the extra money ?
0	i needed my site up and running so i could make some money .
0	after over 000 emails between me and them the director of holbi shows up and tries to mediate ( to his credit he '_s quite a friendly bloke ).
0	so finally , after an exasperating 0 months my project was delivered still quite unfinished , overbudget and buggy .
0	modules are also insanely over costed .
0	i enquired_about a few changes i needed to be made and i think i managed to get them down to about £_000 in the end .
0	i decided to shop around and managed to get the same thing ( plus a couple of other tweaks ) for £_000 from a stellar developer whom i trust implicitly and has not let_me down .
0	none of the people who work for holbi ( at_least that i spoke to ) seem to speak_english as a first language .
0	there were frequent misunderstandings and terribly written emails which were sometimes very difficult to decipher .
0	considering they put themselves forward as a leading company in the uk you would think they would put the time in to learn the language properly so they could more effectively communicate with their customers .
0	i initially went with holbi to save me having to code the site myself .
0	i could have done it myself if i wanted to but i thought i ' d let them take care of it so i could focus more of my time on other areas of the business but without constant reminders they seem to forget about your project .
0	i ' d say if you have very deep pockets , go to them and say " i need a website , i don_'_t care how much it costs " or " i need a website , i don_'_t care what it looks_like " then they would probably provide a decent service because they seem to be technically proficient ( there wasn_'_t anything i was told " couldn_'_t be done ") but if you have an existing design and functionality in mind then please , shop elsewhere .
0	lastly , i am still finding numerous bugs in the site and with the payment gateways that cost me yet more money to put right .
0	i '_ve had the whole paypal gateway replaced with a better module because of frequent problems with it and the nochex gateway gives me major issues like processing orders twice and " double restocking " products when duplicate orders are deleted .
0	very helpful , attentive and thorough service .
0	my rep , emma , answered all my queries and helped_me solve my problem .
0	i definitely recommend their services to one and all .
0	thanks emma .
0	everything_went_smoothly .
0	spoke to someone on chat straight after to confirm reservations and they were very helpful too , even changing one of the reservations for me to take into account a late arrival .
0	would recommend to anyone .
0	i '_ve ordered twice from bedsonlegs now and they '_ve been perfect both_times .
0	good products , excellent communication , prompt delivery and low_prices .
0	really can '_t fault them .
0	they already have the cheapest supplements , but if you find a website with it cheaper you can get 0 %_off the cheaper price !
0	extremely great deal , has all the supplements you can think of .
0	don_'_t waste your time with gnc or any other stores , this is where you want to go for any supplements .
0	thanks supplement_warehouse !
0	i move around quite a bit , but never between countries with more than a suitcase , so i didn_'_t know how it would go moving a ton of furniture , clothes , etc ... with a removals firm .
0	i had used lopa '_s services in the past , but for very small things .
0	i am so glad i used them for my big move back to the uk from france .
0	all email_exchanges were smooth and timely .
0	cost was very reasonable for the service i wanted .
0	and , the most_important_thing - the move went smoother than i thought possible .
0	not even 0 glass broken .
0	the guys on both_ends were amazing .
0	i would happily_recommend this company to anyone and i would use them again !
0	really the title of this review says it all .
0	i have bought numerous items from aria online over the years and often recommend them to friends and family .
0	aria offer fantasic service and value for money on all products i have ever investigated with them .
0	i do feel that the shipping can get a bit on the expensive side when either ordering a number of items or high value items which do not include free shipping .
0	all in all - a great company to purchase from though !
0	i was so so dubious_about ordering from here , the bad_reviews were worrying and the price seemed too good to be true .
0	i decided to risk it and order anyway and was so glad that i did , item arrived super_fast , was well_packaged and i got it for a great price .
0	i was even able to get cashback from top_cashback .
0	would definitely order from here again .
0	i sold my broken phone to mazuma as they buy these off you , i requested a pack to be sent to me and this arrived next_day , i packed my phone and sent it and had the money by the end of the week .
0	the service was quick , easy and simple .
0	i '_ve always order off of the same supplement site , and decided to give it a change because supplement_warehouse '_s prices are unbeatable , and if they are beat ... well , supplement_warehouse beat '_s the price again with it '_s awesome 0 % less price adjuster .
0	they also hand out boat loads of free_gifts !
0	i '_ve had free_gifts from other_sites , but with this there are so many !
0	definitely sticking to the supplement_warehouse from now on !
0	first time using instant gaming ; i was extremely impressed at the speed in which i recieved the key and very impressed with their pricing .
0	great site !
0	simple website to use and even using the free delivery the parcel was at my door ( fully_tracked by text_message along the way ) in less_than 00hrs .
0	would definitely recommend ( and actually already have !)
0	i ' d definitely use mazuma again .
0	i posted my phone special delivery and then between 00am and 0pm the following_day had four emails , two confirming the receiving and processing of my phone then the other two about the payment .
0	there were no_quibbles at any point about the amount i was to be paid it was just put straight into my account .
0	all in all from posting to receiving the money i would say it took about 00_hours and it '_s fair to say i was extremely impressed !
0	was referred to this site as one of the best places to get product keys quick , easy and at an affordable price !
0	after taking a look and placing and order i was not let_down !!
0	will most definitely be coming_back here in the future !
0	the service was brilliant !!!!
0	easy to place an order and they were quick to organise a delivery date .
0	the delivery company gave_us a delivery time_slot to which they kept by it and were very helpful in bringing the product inside the property .
0	the staffs was very friendly and polite and will go out of their way to make_sure you are happy with the products you have brought and find other products that are similar if the one you are after is no_longer available .
0	i will use this again .
0	ordered various office supplies at 0pm and they arrived first thing the following_morning - brilliant , just what we needed
0	printer land did an amazing job quickly sent out my ink for my printer first thing the next_day .
0	also purchased my printer from them over 0 years_ago and we use it on a daily_basis amazing quality they sell
0	thank_you
0	not only was simply_games the cheapest for a pre order , my game was also delivered 0 days early !
0	highly_recommended .
0	this was my first time ordering from digitalrev and it will not be the last , the price of the item was £_000 cheaper_than the uk and it was delivered in a couple of days .............. from bloody hong_kong how is that possible when companies in the uk can take a couple weeks sending something couple hundred_miles_away .
0	have my eye on a canon 00 - 000_f0 or 0 . 0 now : d
0	i '_ve only ever used them for ds cards but they always arrive on time and their prices are fantastic ( i always go for the ship from jersey option so avoiding vat - they say 0 - 0 day delivery but usually 0 - 0 days ).
0	ordered a card at christmas - never arrived .
0	they said they ' d send a replacement in january - never arrived .
0	had to do a charge back with my credit_card company .
0	then got an email_saying they had sent me my order and the post_office had returned it as i had not been available for delivery ( had to sign for it ).
0	asked for proof of this and they failed to give me the rd number - bunch of idiots !
0	got my money back thanks to visa .
0	ordered my card ( dstt 0gb ) on monday about 00am and got it the following_morning by recorded delivery .
0	the card is the bees_knees - and no had any_problems since ( no need to contact them so cannot_comment on their customer service ).
0	will be using them again !
0	ordered a key and received within 0 minutes of payment , great service !
0	picked_up a deuter race exp air from snow & rock for £_00 delivered .
0	included was the £_00 deuter streamer that is usually sold separately .
0	srp on the bag alone is £_00 , overall excellent value plus a one day delivery .
0	this was my first time buying from thegamecollection and i '_m very impressed .
0	taking up their daily " flash sale " gave an unbeatable price ( with free shipping ) and the game was delivered within two_days , well_packaged .
0	i '_ll certainly be looking to use the site again in future and give my full recommendation !
0	al_round excellent service , many_thanks !
0	ordered a play mat for godless shrine always wanted one they had a sale ordered and got it in 0 days no_problems well_packed and safe a good reliable company a +++
0	i have just spoken with jenny via live_chat and it was a pleasant_experience , veto professional and polite .
0	would happily use this service again .
0	this is one of a number if occasions i have used mega_fancy_dress .
0	their ebay shop is very easy to navigate and when i have requested info on costumes my query has_been dealt_with very quickly and answered the required detail .
0	the despatch is always confirmed and the delivery speedy .
0	the products are very reasonably_priced and of high_quality and ebay purchases are covered by a very generous returns_policy .
0	very highly_recommended - thank_you very much !
0	this company has messed_up everything their interbroand and phone have the slowest speeds possible and they dont respond to customer feedback well or send any kind of replacements when you tell them you cant use their internet , i had a cotnract with them and they charged through the teeth for a service i wasnt getting and when i tried to cancel they slapped a £_000 bill on top of that .
0	they dont even deserve the one star
0	i '_ve_used these for a while now to buy food for my labrador as they offer free next_day delivery .
0	i recently change my dogs food which didn_'_t agree with her , so emailed for a bit of advice .
0	i received a really well thought out and clear response with advice the same day .
0	they are usually the cheapest around or within a few_quid , but i value there service at worth more than the negligible difference .
0	i ' d highly_recommend them .
0	i booked 0 tickets for the v festival 0000 in chelmsford for me and my friends .
0	we were all worried_about booking the tickets as there was only 0_weeks to go before the event when we booked them , and we had never ordered tickets from double0 in the past .
0	on the day prior to receiving the tickets i had a phone_call from double0 telling_me the tickets would arrive in the morning and they did .
0	all wristbands were in perfect_condition and we all had a great time , will never be worried_about using double0tickets again .
0	i ordered the original source item ( which has_been_discontinued ) and i found it here at a great price .
0	i ordered from them for the first time and the item was delivered promptly and was exactly as_described .
0	very happy about t his !
0	good online service .
0	everything good , thanks !
0	i signed_up for a 000 - reg vps in december_0000 .
0	one fine day in january_0000 i woke to discover that my server was down .
0	no matter , i thought i would login and get it back up .
0	the control_panel showed that the vps was " suspended ".
0	there had been no attempt to email me or phone me the impending suspension of my account , and no failed payment attempts were logged on my account activity .
0	all i found was that the control_panel did not allow me to restore the vps , and there was no option to renew .
0	i contacted customer service by chat at 0am , who proceeded to open a ticket .
0	but customer service repeatedly failed to understand my issue , that the vps had no restore option .
0	furthermore , no 000 - reg engineers attempted to restart the vps .
0	so here we are , 00_hours , with critical business data sitting on a vps i cannot access , with no attempt by 000 - reg to contact me , and no serious attempt by 000 - reg engineers having taken place to restart my vps .
0	conclusion , dear readers , do not use 000 - reg vps service .
0	they appear to operate a high_volume low_cost business , with low_cost meaning woefully_inadequate support to recover a vps .
0	not only that , but it takes real contempt for customers to suspend a vps without warning by email or phone , and then to make no attempt during a whole business day to restart the vps .
0	not too mention total_failure by 000 - reg to reassure me that data had not been lost .
0	anyone affiliated with ' we can help you claim for your accident ' spam text_messages - as this company are - should be avoided like the plague .
0	i took a punt on tsohost on the recommendation of a trusted friend and i '_ve never looked back since .
0	their support is second to none , and that '_s coming from someone_who is used to the level of support offered by rackspace .
0	amazing service , amazing price .
0	i particularly recommend their clustered hosting_packages .
0	i can '_t recommend tsohost highly_enough .
0	mazuma were great , fast , easy and hassle_free .
0	would recommend to anyone .
0	i have to admit , i '_m very wary and sceptical of some of these cd_key websites and i did mull over it for a few_days before_deciding to do it and it was well_worth it .
0	i '_ve never seen such a secure payment system in place that actually looks out for the customer and when they say instant delivery they mean it , the key is waiting for you once you verify your email ( because i '_m a first time buyer ) and the whole_process was just simple .
0	i '_m always getting my pc games from here from now on , many_thanks guys !
0	great selection of products and the best prices i '_ve been able to find for muscle_milk .
0	order was processed very quickly and money was transferred to bank same day as phone received !
0	top quality service !
0	i recently got bf0 !
0	the transaction was smooth , amazingly simple , and a pleasure .
0	i got the cd_key sent via_email in next to no time , and already have friends who i have recommended the website too .
0	the best cd_key site i have ever used !
0	could not give you guys , anymore praise as words are not enough .
0	thanks very much happy customer : d
0	i purchased a nikon_d0000 from digitalrev . com , and it was an easy pleasant_transaction .
0	i received my item within a few_days from ordering .
0	as it was being shipped from_hk , i expected more of a wait to be honest , but was pleasantly_surprised to receive it so quickly .
0	it was well_packaged and secure for the post .
0	the communication was top stuff , i received all emails and tracking_information asap .
0	not to mention that they have the best prices on the market for this piece of kit .
0	:)
0	the only_niggle was that the instruction_manuals were all in japanese , however a sticker on the front of the manual directed me to a nikon web_page where i could download and print an english copy off .
0	so not a real problem at all .
0	cant_wait to purchase my next gear for this camera from these_guys .

0	i have pre_- ordered my xbox one day one edition console 0_weeks before lounch as simplygames were the only one that still could guarantee delivery for 00nd nov .
0	the most importanc for me anyways was that they were comunicating to me at all times what is going on with my order and they did take the payment only after they have been 000_% sure that they will fulfill all their promises .
0	my new console arrived on 00nd at 0000 which made me a very happy guy !
0	thank_you to simplygames team for working hard on this !
0	recommended !!
0	!
0	order placed online late_afternoon and delivered by 00am next_day .
0	very happy with the product and i will_continue to shop with printerland in the future .
0	if i have to write about comet repair service ( which is now closed ) i can easily write a book .
0	in short i went to clean the vents on my hp_laptop .
0	it took 0 hours 0 people !
0	they broke the cables for audio , they even broke one of the built in speakers .
0	hard_drive and battery_charger lights don_'_t work anymore !
0	this review btw is for the hemel_hempstead store .
0	debenhams in my opinion is best for quality and sales offers .
0	i also own a debenhams card so i get exclusive offers and vouchers .
0	we absolutely love to shop in debenhams be it for clothing , kitchenwares , furnitures or cosmetics / toiletries
0	staff are always helpful !
0	we went to find out info about hiring a rug doctor .
0	it took us 00_mins to get hold of someone_who can guide us .
0	spoke with one staff , they pointed us to another , and this went on for a while and finally we were asked to wait at the tiling desk where we spent about 00_mins and then again we started to chase staff .
0	finally someone came in who didn_'_t even bother to say sorry that you had to wait .
0	i kept_repeating we have been waiting here for 00mins and he never said sorry !
0	always there to help , checkouts are quick and they try and help whatever they can during the busy hours .
0	when offers are on , its probably the cheapest even cheaper_than asda .
0	love the products , quality and the variety .
0	the downside is its way to expensive .
0	the same accessories are much much_cheaper_elsewhere .
0	saw a mass amount of great deals and decided to shop at supplement_warehouse and was even more pleased to see i get free_samples / gifts with my purchase on top of these unbeatable deals .
0	the shipping cost is well_worth it and i still saved a lot of cash .
0	i follow their youtube_channel which has some amazing reviews and videos .
0	it was here that i discovered their store .
0	i ordered a blackstar ht - 0r from them on the wednesday and it was delivered to me friday_morning .
0	its a fantastic amp and i received a great service from andertons .
0	i will_definitely buy from them again .
0	they were very quick to dispatch and were very well priced
0	i ordered a stethoscope at half 0ish and it had been engraved and dispatched by 00 .
0	superb service .
0	i '_m building my own pc and was recommended aria by a friend .
0	all i have received is great customer service , excellent delivery service and a fantastic forum option .
0	i couldn_'_t have asked for more .
0	thank_you aria !
0	where do i start ?
0	i ordered a talking ted toy for £_00 from gameseek , only to be told after 0_weeks of waiting for delivery that it was out of stock ( even_though it was stated as in stock when i ordered it ).
0	i said i would wait , so and waited ....
0	decided to email and ask what was going on , and they said they were having trouble getting stock .
0	so i asked for a refund ... no problem they said .
0	i am still_waiting , over 0 months !!!!
0	!
0	constant emails back and forth with them claiming they have sent a refund , yet me never receiving a penny and no record of the transaction_id in paypal .
0	coincidentally , after i ask for a refund the item miraculously becomes_available again , so i ask if they can send me the product instead of my refund ... no problem , we '_ll chargeback the ' refund ' and have it delivered ... do you think i have recieved it ?
0	haha
0	they then claim they never said they could chargeback the ' refund ' even_though i have it in an email , which they have been sent a copy of .
0	then when i ask them to contact paypal and sort the matter out seeing as they have apparently sent a refund , they stop replying to emails .
0	0 emails in total asking what was happening but not one reply !
0	!
0	have to say i would never buy from them again , they haven_'_t even offered me an_apology and have accused me of lying , i have contacted consumer watchdog and am taking_legal_advice on the matter at the moment
0	i didn_'_t have to wait at all and the rep was great !
0	i have been with tso now for a couple of years and the level of knowledge and support they provide is simply the best .
0	when i submit a support_ticket , its answered within minutes , regardless of the time of day .
0	the prices are also very reasonable and i look_forward to continue using tso for the future :)
0	i got recommend to mr_memory , by a friend but i was not sure what i needed , so i contacted mr_memory a while back and they told me what i needed .
0	recieved my order this week and installed it with no problem .
0	i would highly_recommend mr_memory !
0	clean site , that keeps things simple !
0	bought a hoover robot and it arrived on time , and was well_packaged !
0	what more could you want ?
0	: d
0	i cannot express my thanks enough for the remarkable job this company does by keeping their prices low and their costumers happy .
0	thank_you !
0	easy to use website , found what i was looking for in mins then paid via_paypal , fast and secure .
0	would shop again .
0	ordered my bass and was received on the day when i received the dispatched email !
0	well_protected in the box and incredibly fast delivery , thanks !
0	service was fast and reliable .
0	i bought my iphone_0s in uk and brought to brazil .
0	in the beginning was detected that my unit was used in brazil and for some reason it was locked .
0	suddenly to use another carrier with gevey .
0	but after paying for release ... after 00hrs my iphone was fully unlocked .
0	and working with any carrier .
0	now my fear to update the phone is gone : d
0	orderid = 000000
0	thanks officialiphoneunlock
0	i made an order on behalf of a friend on a friday_afternoon , i selected the saturday delivery , i contacted there team using a social_networking site and they got back to me with in minutes , confirming that the item would be dispatched that day and would arrive with me next_day .
0	true to there word it did and i have been informed that the " sizing was perfect and the dress hung well " as a man i have no idea what this means but it sounds positive lol ....
0	i found there team extremely polite and well informed and i would defiantly recommend to anyone .
0	if a man like me who has no fashion sense what so ever can be guided_through the process they really can hep anyone .
0	defiantly worth a 0 start rating
0	our company has_been using payapl for around 0 - 0 months without_any_issues then payapl decided they would wanted documentation from us .
0	we promptly sent this off to them and received a confirmation_email , stating your account is now active .
0	then less_than 00_hours_later another email from them stating our account is permanently limited .
0	when we called there limitation department we spoke to the first person_who proceeded to be very aggressive towards us and when we asked to speak to manager she refused and stated if you want to speak to some one else call back in we explained that we had been on hold for 00_minutes before we got threw to her she then said tough and ended the call .
0	so we called again and spoke to the most unhelpful person i have ever_dealt his_name was patrick .
0	he decided to scream at us that he would not escalate the call any high than him and that we where wasting our time and his by calling him .
0	this is not the attitude to have when working in support .
0	we where simply asking for information on why this had happened and to see if there was anything we could do to resolve this as we had all of our captial tied up in paypal .
0	he then stated he didnt care and ended the call .
0	paypal have basically bank rupted us today with there ridiculous policy .
0	they have no idea of how to help a customer or of what internal escalation is .
0	they have decided to keep our funds for 0 months and given no reason .
0	we recommend any new business not to use them and stay as far away as possible for t his disgusting company .
0	this is the worse company i have ever_dealt_with .
0	they seem to use every method possible to avoid you been able to withdraw your winnings .
0	i would a relatively_small_amount £_00 over a month_ago and still have not been able to withdraw this .
0	they requested i send in a copy of my passport which is ridiculous .
0	i have sent this is in then they came back with can you please resend this .
0	they should get zero_stars they are attempting to steal my winnings .
0	i would warn everyone not to use them use one of the more well established sites such as bet fair or williamhill who dont try and use the tactics to steel your money .
0	i use this service a lot , and it works well .
0	quick access to a wide_range of takeaways in the area and their menu , means it is very easy to cruise and get just what you are looking for .
0	ordering is simple and paying is very easy if you save your card_details .
0	the one time ( out of maybe 00 - 00 orders ) a takeaway has failed to deliver hungryhouse customer_support were very helpful , swiftly censuring the takeaway and refunding my money .
0	the customer service was very good .
0	my only reservation on the whole service is that it is too easy !
0	some nights you can have ordered a takeaway in moments on a whim .
0	not so good for the waistline .
0	i ordered a product code for a product i had picked_up secondhand and which had already been registered on steam .
0	within about 0 minutes of reaching the simplycdkeys . com website i had my code and was playing the game .
0	optical_express gave_me the chance to go without glasses .
0	they offered a good service with plenty of support .
0	they explained things to me well and i felt i understood everything which was going on .
0	if i had any concerns they talked them through and reassured me .
0	now my recovery period is complete it feels_like i have always been this way and it is strange to see pictures of myself wearing_glasses .
0	after being with orange for more than 0 years they have been brilliant , great value for money , great talk plans and excellent service .
0	after using envirophone and having an exptremly bad service - i decided to send my handset to mazuma , i sent them my handset on monday and they confirmed_receipt of it on tuesday and money was in my bank_account on the same day by 0pm .... will_def_use again and highly_recomend .
0	thanks mazuma
0	i bought a game on macstop - i was slightly_worried ' cos they are new but the whole_thing was great .
0	much_better_than buying from a big faceless company - very easy experience , great product , and at really low_prices .
0	nothing to complain_about - will_def_use again
0	i used sell your laptop purely_because it was the top trusted link on google , and offered a nice price for my old hp compaq .
0	the courier collected the item on the day of asking , early morning , which i ' d put it an old cardboard_box .
0	no real problems with the service , other than i had to wait a few_days longer for my money , due to the courier taking the laptop to the wrong depot .
0	even so , i phoned and asked , and was told the problem virtually straight_away , and said they ' d resolve it as soon as possible .
0	the problem was solved the next_day , and then i received the money .
0	overall , a great service and brilliant company .
0	i would highly_recommend sell your laptop to anyone .
0	it is the second purchase from this website . very well_packed and really quick delivery . i am really pleased and i will_definitely buy again from them .
0	great experience , the game i ordered arrived quicker_than stated in the delivery estimate , in great order and with some nice packaging and letter containing details .
0	vast product range , thorough and thoughtful customer service both before and after purchasing the products which was very handy considering my inexperience with this level of camera hardware and software and highly competitive_pricing .
0	will be recommending to any colleague , friend or family in the future and have found my one stop_shop for all things camera .
0	this company is awesome .
0	they had everything i needed , plus things i now want .
0	i will_definitely , guaranteed 000_%, be shopping here again !
0	i would recommend this company for either experienced or novice online shoppers ...
0	it '_s great !
0	!
0	i put full reg in and got quotes from older cars that the engine would not work with waste of time wasted half my day !!!
0	avoid
0	fast delivery and amazing products thankyou
0	the network lost all service on friday the 00th and promised to make it up to its customers then next thing they say there donating to charity not helping the people that make it grow . this is a complete pr stunt by the company ! "
0	network run buy us " its a joke its a way of saving money after all people that are on the network have to pay for a months goodbag .
0	we lost a day no one said anything about donating to charity they just did it .
0	i know they have more than 00 , 000 people on there network so if they give them all £ 0 each that would be £_00k so a £_00k donation is a huge_saving plus they can claim the vat back this company is a joke !!
0	and i am leaving as soon as i can !
0	we found the whole long weekend very enjoyable and well planned form the start .
0	our guide , naomi , was incredible throughout , even with 00 drunken lads .
0	i would definitely recommend pissup to anyone looking to do a stag_weekend or similar .
0	after_contacting a lot of similar companies , they were the only ones not to hassle me with almost hourly phone_calls .
0	thanks pissup !
0	!
0	hostelbookers . com has a great range of hostels for booking .
0	i found a great deal in a very cool part of sydney that i otherwise would have missed .
0	the website was very easy and the prices were great !
0	i plan to keep using s . w .
0	!
0	thanks !
0	:) you ' re great
0	i ' d been looking for an ssd at an affordable price for a while , so when aria was suggested to me and i instantly found a suitable product on sale ( and there are plenty of these ) i was very pleased .
0	plenty of technical details on the site , plus the ability to ask for feedback on pretty_much an question at the bottom of the page made the experience of choosing a product very easy .
0	ordering was as expected of any site today , and delivery was swift and cost efficient .
0	overall a very good experience .
0	i was about to order from this company using their lovely looking website but was thankfully told otherwise by a colleague .
0	they had ordered items weeks_ago and have never arrived !
0	on top of all this , i have their ugly banners following me around wherever i go !
0	a classic case of not judging a book by its cover !
0	very helpful staff that helped_me with all my queries .
0	always a pleasure to deal with the guys at the old dairy !
0	i needed a dj for my asian wedding and these_guys were professional and very talented .
0	an experienced bunch with a great sense of humour , exactly_what i was looking for .
0	will use again !
0	ordered some play and charge kits for my xbox one controller and they turned_up the very next_day .
0	very happy with the service .
0	their prices are very good as well !
0	i '_ve moved all my game pre_- orders to simplygames just because they ' re cheaper and i know their delivery is top_notch .
0	i was sketchy at first before buying but i took the plunge and i '_m glad i did .
0	very reliable service , got my key_instantly .
0	the best online_retailer for games .
0	cheap and usually delivered before release_date , if pre_- ordering or next_day if the game is already out .
0	very recommended !
0	the website is extremely easy to use and navigate through .
0	i really like the fact that hostelbookers tells you the most_popular cities in each country you select .
0	registration and booking process and quick and painless .
0	couldn_'_t be_happier with my experience .
0	organised courier for a ebay transaction , deliveree was out when supposed to be in .
0	parcel0go tried several_times to re - deliver , then came up on the tracking screen as awaiting instruction .
0	went_onto the live_chat , spoke rose who was very helpful and had sorted re - delivery out within 0 minutes .
0	many_thanks
0	this is the best , the only site to shop for when looking for anything supplement related !
0	more than reasonable prices and shipping is beyond fast !
0	well , getting the point of putting a quote out there was dead simple and very easy , after that things got a little hairy , for instance_:
0	- changing details an asking for re - quotes was a pain , shouldn_'_t this be automatic ?
0	- having to hunt through the faq to find how to pay the courier an_hour before they arrived .
0	shiply make it easy to pay for they deposit ( their fee ) but after that you are on your own .
0	i assumed i would pay the rest via the site also , and had to quickly run out for the final cash , a bit_annoying that this wasn_'_t pointed_out in the ' how it works ' ( makes me think keeping it to three steps was more important than the usefulness , more marketing than anything ).
0	there are other oddities , but i would use the site again , for it does that first bit of the process very well and know i know some of the quirks ( there are more i can '_t remember ) i feel_comfortable using the service again .
0	if you want the newest games but dont wonna pay premium prices then look no thurther .
0	its not only games though , theres also xbox_points , internet security and wow time .
0	they respond srtaight away and send your keys instantly .
0	a must for any nerd :-)
0	very fast and reliable
0	very fast delivery and really good price .
0	absolute_pleasure to make a purchase as usual .
0	not my first and definitely not last .
0	totally recommended :)
0	thank_you team digitalrev !
0	great modern addition to anyones underwear draw , great fit , comfortable and fun designs
0	i use hotesone frequently for business trip accommodation .
0	i find the website very reliable , secure and good value !
0	i got an excellent deal on my regular hotel in london .
0	was cheaper_than going direct with the hotel itself .
0	unlike most bingo rooms , they have new and fun promotions every week .
0	they don_'_t just look after the vip '_s either .
0	i only spend about £_00 per week but their promotions offer me a chance to get something back .
0	they also do casino and poker with the same range of promotions .
0	hesitant to order as to be honest i thought the website looked a little sketchy .
0	ive been using computers for as long as i can remember and know to be careful when shopping around online .
0	i read other_peoples review before i ordered and was happy with what i saw .
0	having the code sent through text i was hesitant as my mobile provider isnt always the best but it took longer for me to remember my paypal password than it did for my key to arrive .
0	would definitely recommend and i will be using again as i got guild_wars cheaper here than it is on the actual gw website
0	i have never had a problem with anything i have ordered online with tesco .
0	every thing has_been delivered_ontime and also by very polite staff .
0	great website and quick prompt service .
0	very well priced too , not many places will allow you to buy single boards but theunderfloorheatingstore will .
0	top_marks , many_thanks
0	received our order safe and sound today and felt_compelled to post our feedback on the whole_experience .
0	firstly , the advisors in the cheltenham showroom were excellent and were full of knowledge and expertise and managed to avoid the “ pushy ” hard_sell which is so off - putting .
0	secondly , to receive a phone_call to confirm a delivery date and time_slot in advance is such a good service to offer , particularly for those of us who work full - time .
0	even_though i was unable to accept the first date they offered they were very accommodating and went away then came back later on with a new date that was more convenient .
0	lastly but by no means least , the quality of the furniture is outstanding and we are over the moon with it .
0	would not_hesitate to recommend your company to all our friends and family so well_done .
0	great service and items with quick delivery . will_definitely be shopping with again ,
0	quick delivery , great price and good quality item
0	ordered on 0 . 0 . 0000 and the wrong items sent . it '_s now 00 . 00 . 0000 and i still_haven_'_t received my order . i went and bought it from another company as still don_'_t know when i will reveive it
0	it arrived in a couple days , and the quality of the product is spot on .
0	i '_ve found no issues with it at all .
0	of course i can '_t expect amazing quality for an £_00 guitar , but for the money i paid , it '_s pretty chuckin ' good .
0	londonmagicstore handled my purchase in a very professional way .
0	they were fast both on communication and delivery .
0	definately worths buying from them again !
0	usually had no_problems spent $ 0000s over the years with supplement_warehouse but lately it seems products are getting sent in damaged condition , as my preworkout came in like a rock and had to send back and reorder .
0	just a hassle but return_policy is legit .
0	great company fast shipping great discounts on all the good products !
0	this company offers a wide_range of flavours , excellent prices for both e_- juice and equipment costs as well as having a very quick order turnaround .
0	i '_ve ordered a few_times now , and on every occasion my order has_been sent within 00_hrs .
0	i have nothing but praise for this company !
0	liberty_flights have an excellent range at very low_prices , very quick shipping times , and an extremely generous loyalty_scheme .
0	i '_m going to be using this company every_month , and i thoroughly_recommend them .
0	ecigwizard has a very clear and easy to use site , and my item was shipped within 00_hours .
0	i will_definately be ordering from this site again in the future .
0	we booked online , confirmation came through quick , text confirmations came through quickly even when abroad .
0	driver was very friendly and always in time .
0	great service
0	00th / 00 -
0	they are cheap to buy from , they deliver fast and are willing to sort_out what very few insignificant issues you may get for example , my pokemon elite trainer box , with was sealed so not card teams fault , was missing 0 booster_packs , they are sending me 0 and claiming them back from pokemon company , fantastic people , bought from here more then once , and will_continue to buy from here , in fact come october / november im buying £_000 worth of pokemon goodies for me ; d
0	spend 000 for free delivery , + i have an account for 0 %_off !
0	perfect : p
0	00th / 00 -
0	once again a brilliant company , hey help with anything they can , there the ideal shop / online_retailer , if all shops was like these_guys they wouldn_'_t go out of business xd
0	i have used merlin_cycles ( amongst other online_retailers ) for many_years and have always found them to provide a reliable and professional service and to offer good value for money .
0	i have even spoken to their sales_team for advice when trying to decide which product to buy and they were helpful and honest .
0	more then happy to recommend them .
0	stag_do in cardiff .
0	accomodation in ideal_location and all activities / venue entries booked with ease allowing everyone to enjoy the weekend
0	all these bad_reviews of trustpilot are pathetic .
0	trustpilot allows the general_public to have a voice on what they think about other_companies and their trading .
0	i have wrote reviews about mobiles . co . uk and yodel , both not great companys if i may say .
0	the reason for the negative_reviews is because companies that are s ** t are getting s ** t press on this site and they can '_t be_bothered to book their ideas up .
0	if your company gives negative_reviews from customers , sort it out and deal with it , don_'_t complain because trustpilot is telling the truth .
0	what trustpilot is doing is moral practise .
0	they ' re stopping potential_customers getting scammed / ripped_off and helping companys improve their customer service
0	i '_m happy with this company , i used them to book a hotel in blackpool for friday 00th_july until saturday 00st_july .
0	was very easy to book and very quick as well .
0	the site is professional and compares the best prices of hotels , would definitely recommend
0	the best site !
0	!
0	ordered my items on the mon , received them on the wed , hassle_free & got what i had asked for .
0	thanks , satisfied customer .
0	i bought a new pair of trainers from sd a couple of weeks_ago , i took them back yesterday to change them .
0	i came_across the manager ( i think he was the manager on the floor ).
0	anyway i asked_him a couple of questions about style & comfort and before i knew it i was being looked after by no less_than two of them , the floor manager & his assistant , who went out their way to accommodate my footwear needs .
0	by the time i had left i had tried on at_least 00 pairs of trainers .
0	( i was encouraged to make_sure the trainer i ended_up buying was perfect for my feet )... even_though i had already bought & they already had my money , they were so incredibly informative & helpful .
0	i left some 00min later with my choice of trainer & i know a hell alot more about insoles , low & high arches , gel support , cushioning .
0	the crash course in trainers , i received in sd by this guy , means never again will i enter a sports shop & be spun a yarn by illinformed , money hungry assistants .
0	so i would just like to say a million thanks to these_guys .
0	i didn_'_t get the boys names - but as i said i think one of them was the floor manager & his smaller , slimmer , younger assistant were both excellent .
0	thanks guys .
0	this company are pathetic , the most unrespectful , incompotent , conning , chancers you will come_across online .
0	they take your money , then ignore you for weeks on end , then when they eventually respond they make up nonsense stories , as explanation for your item having not been delivered .
0	they simply don_'_t care one jot .
0	i still have not received my order & they have decided to ignore me again .
0	i am now writting to the sale of goods_act , to make a complaint as should you : it is your right to make a complaint to the sale of goods_act , stating : the seller is legally bound to deal with the item , regardless of whether they are acting as a third_party , as they are your point of contact - & as such they are resonsible for the items , as you have proof of purchase , which will be shown on your confirmation receipt mail or your bank_statement .
0	i am claiming £_000 from them as they delayed my film shoot , as my items did not arrive on time .
0	i would advise anyone who feels agrieved to do the same , as it '_s the only way to get ecrater & other dodgy online sellers off - line .
0	& so protect ourselves in the future .
0	i will be repeating this email in as many review strands as i can find - one honest review for each day that my order does not arrive .
0	i don_'_t mind doing this everyday .
0	it makes me feel a little less angry at the way they have treated me .
0	do not trust this company !
0	this company is simply a disgrace .
0	their customer service is a non - starter and they lie about items being delivered .
0	a next_day delivery i ordered , still didn_'_t arrive after two_weeks and still_hasn_'_t arrived .
0	i received one response saying that they had tried to deliver - not true - we have orders coming in from all over europe on a daily_basis - and always have someone on hand to receive deliveries .
0	avoid at all costs - they are cowboys
0	shopto is an amazing site , the service they provide is excellent , super_fast dispatch , friendly and helpful staff and amazing prices , better then most other_retailers out there .
0	supplement_warehouse is the best !
0	i '_ve been shopping there for my supplement_needs for two years and havent been disappointed with one aspect of it .
0	it ships fast and when you buy in bulk you will save_money on shipping and on the total_cost .
0	and if you do some reserch of your own and find a better price , just type it in and they will match it and then take 00 percent off of the new price .
0	very quick delivery with no_problems ordering at all .
0	plus a free_shaker and a welcome letter .
0	what more could you want .
0	i would def recommend especially if you can '_t make it down to the store !
0	very quick delivery , would def recommend .
0	also replied to my query very quickly and helped with my request !
0	received my order quickly and having been using it for a little while now i am totally surprised at how well it tastes and mixes .
0	the nutritionals are as good , and sometimes better , than the shakes i normally buy .
0	will keep using bulkpowders and see if it '_s a good as it seems so_far .
0	would recommend without_hesitation .
0	a great range of products and the prices are great .
0	have used them for about 0 months and no_problems .
0	it was easy to make an order and had what i wanted , the only problem was that i ordered a size too small but that was my own fault !
0	but i sent it back and that was easy enough to get a bigger_size !
0	i '_ve just received my first order from hifiheadphones and they haven_'_t put a foot wrong : the product is great , the price was good , the dispatch was very prompt , and they kept me updated with the order status via_email .
0	what more can you ask for ?
0	i ordered it yesterday , it arrive today ?
0	was it dropped_off by plane ?
0	possibly the quickest delivery i '_ve ever_witnessed .
0	also the rams amazing and cheap !
0	i saw stock of the item i wanted in a branch across the country , so i phoned them to ask about its condition and price and the stock they had left , and they were very helpful .
0	i completed the purchase online and it arrived the next_day .
0	great store !
0	ebuyer is always my go - to site for checking deals on hardware i need .
0	it always compares_favourably to physical stores , and the lack of clutter on the website makes it both a breeze and a pleasure to navigate .
0	i have used p0g many_times and have always had great experiences .
0	the odd_occasion i did have a little issues it was resolved by sam very quickly so once again big_shout out to sammy .

0	simply_games is awesome , quick delivery times ( quickest i '_ve had from anywhere ) great customer service , and nothing '_s ever went wrong with an order yet .
0	i switched to simply_games because whenever a site messes up my order , i usually don_'_t place orders with them again . but since i '_ve started_using simplygames , i '_ve never looked back .
0	great services , great job !
0	i '_ve_used interparcel maybe 00 times before - and about 00_% of the time there has_been an issue .
0	the latest issue is that they have re - arranged_collection 0 times now as the courier didn_'_t bother coming to collect the parcel .
0	the email responses from the heads of customer ' service ' were bordering on obnoxious , and quite_frankly , i '_m seriously disgusted with the service and the manner in which i '_ve been treated .
0	i ' d rather take a cheese grater to my eyeballs than have to deal with interparcel again .
0	i ordered am isp decimator g - string from toneworld , as nowhere_else seemed to stock it .
0	i ordered it about 0pm , and it arrived the next_day !
0	excellent service and the guys there are very helpful .
0	no_complaints at all !
0	as a young guy that is dedicated to making muscles in the mirror im always looking for good supplements to support them its hard to find good prices on these especially when there are shops like gnc , complete nutrition , or vitamin_shoppe they like to take_advantage of people that are uneducated to the true prices that things should be i catch people who are very out fo shape walking into gnc all the time and i ask why are you going in there the usual response is i want good supplements and advice i tell them get a book and get on supplement_warehouse you don_'_t want to pay almost 000 . 00 for 0 lbs of protein its ridiculous i became_aware of your site when i was 00 and since i haven_'_t looked back thank_you for providing such a great service and great haste to get the supplements i order to my house asap
0	went for a stag_weekend in krakow .
0	chillisauce sorted us out with an excellent hotel , party bus , and a guide to take us around various pubs and clubs .
0	well_worth the money and i would heartily_recommend them .
0	if you like music - you '_ll like this store .
0	all you need in one place with friendly customer service )) lovely )
0	p . s .
0	hi from russia )
0	i couldn_'_t be_happier with the site .
0	my unlock went perfectly .
0	i checked and double_checked my unlock status and it '_s completely good .
0	i highly_recommend these_dudes !
0	i had some sites with godaddy and some with lcn , but i found the godaddy site extremely difficult to navigate and support difficult to contact .
0	lcn , on the other hand , has a very - easy - to - use site , and support requests are answered extremely quickly and well .
0	i asked a question on sunday_night , not strictly related to their site , and they came back to me with very helpful advice before 00am on monday_morning .
0	nice flowers delivered very fast .
0	unfortunately no email was sent to confirm the order had been received , and the invoice is sent as a pdf attachment , which is much less convenient than just having the details written in the email .
0	i am writing this while on hold to yodel .
0	they put a card through my door saying they had tried to deliver when i was out .
0	i rearranged delivery for today but they never turned_up .
0	their web_site provides no useful_information so now i am on hold on the phone to them .
0	ten_minutes so_far .
0	i buy from my protein because it is the cheapest i have found , and the protein is as good as any other .
0	my last order was delivered really quickly .
0	the laptops i have had from dell have been good , but customer service is awful .
0	the last time i called customer service they gave_me a quote for support , then tried to increase it during the call .
0	they took_ages to attempt to resolve the problem but were ultimately unsuccessful .
0	it took hours .
0	i am surprised they were not more familiar with their own products .
0	on another occasion they quoted me £_00 to replace the cds i got when i first bought the laptop .
0	i took it to a shop where they reinstalled everything for £_00 , saving me £_00 .
0	i bought a rucksack from gear - zone .
0	it was cheaper_than any other web_site and i had several questions after receiving it .
0	every question was answered within 00_hours by jo in customer_services , even including images and additional useful_information at times .
0	i will_definitely go back to gear - zone the next time i need walking or camping_gear .
0	iphone_app !
0	been using for 0 years_now and its absolutely fantastic !
0	saved me so much money that i check it everytime i shop online now !
0	so pleased with this company .
0	i got an email from them and was looking to buy something .
0	had a look and not only where they the cheapest they also gave_me free delivery and i had it by the end of the week !
0	the least i could do was to leave a review !
0	i have been using supplement_warehouse for a few_years_now and i can_honestly_say i dont go_anywhere_else when its time to get my supps .
0	i grew tired of the over priced stores i used to get my supplements from and the other online stores that say they are the best prices but then when you compare them they usually equal what you pay in stores anyway .
0	supplement_warehouse delivers their products not only fast but shipped also with care and free goodies !
0	this isnt anyone from their site making this review but a real_person_who just appreciates the service of a great company and will_continue to be a supporting customer for years to come !
0	never has booking a cab been so easy !
0	i '_ve ordered more than a few products for myself and others at fd , and they '_ve always come on time and in perfect delivery condition .
0	can '_t fault this company , especially for the prices !
0	bought a leather bed and milton dining_set from furniture choice .
0	the items were delivered full , intact and without damage at exactly the time they said it would be ( rare to happen these days !).
0	started by putting the dining_set together , the table was so easy to assemble ( 0 mins ) as most of it was already put_together !
0	the chairs are a slightly_different_story , as the alan key needed to bolt the seat and legs on was nigh on useless ( no torque , kept slipping ) but luckily i have steady hands so i managed to get it together and solidly !
0	the set is really nice , sturdy and you can tell it is well built with quality materials , not some crappy , just - as - expensive flat_pack furniture made of chipboard ( are you listening smpf - swedish mass - produced furniture ?!).
0	very happy with that and for such a good price .
0	the bed i bought was even easier to put_together , it looks amazing in my room with the other furniture and now i have a proper grown up bed !
0	another bargain and a quality , well made bed ( it '_s been thoroughly tested already !).
0	can '_t really fault fc , my biggest problem was getting_rid of all the packaging !
0	;) nice one fc , i am a fan and will no doubt be buying from you again soon !
0	viagogo was a good experience , emailed me before the event with clear_instructions , however on entering the event my ticket wasn_'_t valid so i '_m not sure i would use again .
0	edited * can '_t reply_below but my transaction_id_0000000
0	just wanted to post here that within an_hour of posting this viagogo had contacted me and refunded the full_amount and offered compensation , really happy with them , thank_you !
0	great all_round just wish you or they could get tje 0000 chevey belair shell back in stock .

0	so many review sites are badly monitored and allow customers without good enough reason to harm companies reputations with false comments .
0	trustpilot . co . uk in my opinion break this mold and offer a fair system with great customer service of their own to back up a very valuable service .
0	we had the idea of where we wanted to stay , however the knowledge of our agent at low_cost was excellent of the area , hotel and surrounding hotels .
0	in the end we experienced a perfect break of everything we required , thank_you diane
0	rob dowding
0	great selection , prompt delivery , well_packed too
0	very pleased with the service over the past two years , rarely_beaten on price , and deliveries are fast and very well_packed , a necessity when ordering £_000 + whiskeys & other spirits
0	i want to say what an absoulute pleasure_dealing_with audio_visual online , especially steve !
0	!
0	steve gave_me a fantastic deal on the yamaha_rx - v000 & monitor_audio mass system .
0	i look_forward to receiving my delivery and getting everything setup .
0	i will do a follow_up review once i have it all set_up and tested .
0	many_thanks again steve and i look_forward to dealing_with you again in the future !
0	richard .
0	bought a pair of climbing_shoes , they even have an accurate sizing_chart , you put in what you currently wear and it gives you an idea of what size you should get .
0	super quick postage , great service all over .
0	thanks
0	found what i was looking for at the lowest_prices .
0	right , to set the scene - i had this date lined_up with an absolutely_stunning girl and thought flowers were the perfect present .
0	sadly this was not the case .
0	now i '_m no connoisseur of bouquets , so i had no idea of the quality .
0	sadly the girl was a bit more educated in floristry than i .
0	she took one look at these flowers and cried , and proceeded to throw them back in my face before legging it .
0	her final words ?
0	' not even a bee would go near those '.
0	and that was it ...
0	i believe this awful bouquet i received cost me my first choice wife .
0	no but seriously , they were not the bouquet i was expecting by any stretch of the imagination , and i '_ll be using another florist in the future .
0	ive ordered from supplementwarehouse . com over a dozen_times now with no_problems_whatsoever .
0	the only thing i could see them improving on would be getting more pre_workout stuff like n . o .
0	xplode and 0 . 0 .
0	just stuff like that so i dont have to go my shop_here in town .
0	( much more_expensive ).
0	ive also ordered jack0d and with this websites great prices an fast shipping i get a great product fast !
0	i bought my guitar and the guitar bag from gear0music recently .. both items are really great .. reasonable price .. great company to deal with ..
0	was ordering atty , and contacted customer_support through contact form to make_sure of some issues - reply was after like 0 min or so and staff was extremely_helpful .
0	after_placing an order , it was processed and sent out for delivery within 00_hours .
0	order was received within the same week .
0	couldn_'_t ask more for an international order / delivery .
0	ordered on the 00th , got them on the 00th .
0	fast and amazing delivery rates .
0	i am a student and really wanted to upgrade to copics .
0	will_definitely be using again and recommend to anyone .
0	i '_ve bought second_hand equiptment from a variety of places but you do often end up with second rate gear , with this company so_far any computer ( desktop or laptop ) has arrived looking and functioning as new .
0	responsive to email enquiries and a very quick delivery service place this company on the top of the pile .
0	im not sure what all the complaints are about , maybe talktalk is terrible in england and great in scotland ?
0	i '_ve been with talktalk for over 0 years and ive never had any technical problems .
0	phone line and broadband have never been interrupted or slowed_down .
0	ive been with bt before which i wouldnt touch with a barge poll again and been with sky which i thought their service was so slow it was a joke .
0	i would only stay with talktalk and everytime i have called them with questions they have been nothing but polite and very helpful .
0	great company in my opinion .
0	great price and a great service
0	ordered a lumia_000 on orange and chose a free xbox_000 000gb and both were delivered to me the day after i received both dispatch emails and was able to track both to my door .
0	i honestly couldn_'_t say a bad_word about buymobilephones . net
0	i have used them twice and had no_problems .
0	would recommend .
0	i received my item quickly with no_problems .
0	amarieze , the member of staff , was polite and helpful .
0	my shirts were properly tailored to my measurements , made from good quality cloth , with double stitching .
0	the price was competitive .
0	overall , highly_recommended .
0	ordered a book from mann '_s .
0	it was cheaper_than everywhere_else and arrived the next .
0	could not ask for better service !
0	the flight attendents wer really snotty an just plain old rude
0	me an my husband an all my family went on 0 so we can all keep intouch for free yay xxxx
0	i sent the phone on the tuesday , money was in my account on the wednesday_afternoon ..... cant get much more instant than that xx
0	had a few questions about the app , answered immediately via online_chat .
0	they always have products i need in stock , at good prices and ship with minimal_fuss or delay .
0	they even throw in freebies and samples as if that wasn_'_t enough !
0	having never_heard of the company before i was skeptical_about using them for such an important occasion as my wedding .
0	however i found them absolutely_brilliant in every way .
0	on their website you can follow the process of your order in minute detail .
0	they even tell you at what process in their factory your order is currently at .
0	when you place your order they give you a date your item will be ready for .
0	for me they beat the due date by 0 full weeks .
0	their customer service is first_class .
0	a couple of days after_placing my order i realised that i ' d measured my finger wrong .
0	i used the live_chat_function on their website to give them the correct_size .
0	no_fuss_whatsoever , the same guy from the live_chat even rang me to confirm he ' d got the details right .
0	the quality of the ring is a0 , and the price i thought was very reasonable .
0	i really can '_t recommend this company strongly enough and i fully_intend to use them again in the future .
0	great website and products at a good value .
0	it has_been a great experience doing_business with supplement_warehouse . com
0	i enrolled onto the sage 00 course to give myself a better knowledge on how to use the programme as it is something that i have to use at work .
0	the course was very easy to understand , and very clear with what needed to be done .
0	it was very easy and instant to get help when needed ( which wasn_'_t very often ) and the team answered all my questions .
0	i would definately recommend the course to others , expecially for the price !

0	i purchased a game as a download only and within 00_minutes i had my codes which worked_perfectly in origin .
0	if you don_'_t like having just the code , you can also purchase the box on it '_s own or you can purchase the box but ziip will send you the code over email so you can start playing straight_away !
0	i get curious when using service '_s i have never_heard of before but this has_been brilliant .
0	i started a subscription four months_ago and they '_ve never been able to correctly deliver the magazine good housekeeping .
0	at first they were delivering it to an incorrect_address , for the first 0 months i contacted them each time to change the address they had on file .
0	they assured me it had changed but then sent it to the wrong_address each time .
0	the forth issue wasn_'_t sent at all !
0	they assured me they ' d send me out a replacement issue as a priority .
0	it never arrived and when i followed it up they said they ' d ran_out .
0	they '_ve refused to refund or cancel my subscription and said it not their policy to refund and quoted the contract to me , despite them not delivering the magazine correctly on any occasion .
0	terrible service , couldn_'_t possibly be any worse , it '_s a magazine_subscription and they ' re not delivering it .
0	how hard can it be ?
0	their customer service are friendly , but offer empty words as the things they promise they '_ve fixed remain broken .
0	they '_ve took my money , failed to provide the service , and refuse to refund .
0	i '_ve finally cancelled with talktalk after 0 years of poor , unreliable service .
0	on their ' upto 0mb ' broadband package they kept telling_me they were providing 0mb to my property , but i experienced typically 0 - 0mb with this dropping to 0mb around peak_times 0 - 00pm .
0	i got all the usual excuses about wifi is slower_than a direct connection , but even wired in my speeds were the same .
0	i can set my mobile_phone up as a 0g wireless hotspot and achieve much_better results .
0	when it came time to cancel i received the worst customer service i '_ve ever_experienced .
0	i called in , spoke to someone and told them i wanted to close my account , they put me on hold for 00mins then cut me off .
0	i tweeted this at which @ talktalkcare picked it up and scheduled a call from a customer_services manager for 0pm .
0	they never called .
0	i called again , got passed to different_departments 0 times , put on hold for another 00mins and then cut_off .
0	they passed me back and forth_between the cancellations team and the home - movers team , it seems neither team wanted my cancellation on their record .
0	both departments felt_like outsourced call_centres where i struggled to communicate with the operators in english , they could only read scripts off the screen not help nor relate to my issues .
0	i called back and had a very difficult conversation with someone in the home - movers team who finally agreed to cancel my account , his english was poor and he didn_'_t understand the questions i asked_him , often contradicting himself .
0	i got my request in to cancel my account .
0	someone tried to call me at 0am sunday morning and left me an answer phone message .
0	i would class this as un - sociable hours .
0	a customer_services ' manager ' called me today to resolve my complaint , again he was out of the country and reading a script in a monotone voice without pausing .
0	he confirmed my account was scheduled to be cancelled and didn_'_t want to listen to my experience at all , he said " i just needed to call you so i can close the ticket on the system ".
0	so yes they may be the cheapest provider in the uk , but they '_ve provided me with a patchy , slow , un - reliable internet_connection and terrible customer service .
0	i recently ordered a new xbox game tomb_raider as they were cheaper_than other_retailers by £ 0 , but it turns_out ordering with zavvi was a mistake .
0	over 00hrs_later i logged in to find my order still ' processing ' and not dispatched .
0	this is incredibly frustrating , when you order a new game waiting for the post is bad enough but adding on extra days because of a slow retailer is unacceptable .
0	fearful the game wouldn_'_t arrive in time for the weekend i clicked ' cancel order ' and gave them my reason , but still i got no response .
0	so i tweeted them to confirm the cancellation so i could go and buy the game from a local retailer instead .
0	over 00hrs_later i got a tweet back saying they hadn_'_t cancelled the order and ignoring my request they ' d charged me and dispatched it regardless .
0	now its the weekend and my game hasn_'_t arrived .
0	i regret ordering with zavvi and which i ' d gone to tesco and paid the extra £ 0 .
0	i suppose if you just want the cheapest option , don_'_t need your item in a timely_fashion and don_'_t require customer service , then zavvi might be ok .
0	but in today '_s competitive market i find this level of service unacceptable .
0	by ignoring my cancel request and dispatching the game late , they may have secured their sale , but they '_ve lost all future business from me .
0	good stuff for low_prices
0	fantastic deals and will_continue to shop with supplement_warehouse .
0	i have been ordering with them for some time now and they always come thru .
0	fast shipment overseas and stateside ... thanks guys for the great products and service .
0	have been using ebuyer since forever i can remember and they '_ve always been great with everything .
0	recommended
0	very trustfull
0	my flights were rescheduled , meaning that i would have to take two more days off work and be stuck in shanghai airport for over 00_hours on both the outward and return journeys .
0	as i wasn_'_t given any alternative , i had to cancel my flights with budgetair .
0	i then asked for the full_refund i was entitled to .
0	initially , budgetair said that it would take 00 - 00 weeks to refund me the ticket amount , but they wouldn_'_t refund the flight booking_fee , credit_card costs or airline failure service .
0	after making an official_complaint to the airline and writing about this experience on trust_pilot , i was given a full_refund within a few_days .
0	my partner and i moved_into a new house with an induction_hob and went to procook to purchase new pans , knowing nothing about induction the sales_assistant explained how it worked , what would work , and then worked out the best vale way to purchase our pans .
0	the whole team where friendly and helpful and the products are fantastic .
0	well_done procook !!
0	( will be going back )
0	i '_ve been really impressed so_far , the prices are really low ( and i shopped_around a lot !)
0	and the delivery looks to be really fast too .
0	i would shop with aria above amazon for pc parts
0	fast delivery and very reasonable price , i ' d use them again with no problem
0	very pleased .
0	great quality at great prices and very fast delivery
0	recommend to everyone
0	yo udo not have enough info about your products on the site ...
0	i had no_problems here .
0	paid on day 0 , delivered on day 0 .
0	i was kept_informed of delivery status by email with dpd tracking .
0	it saved me a few_pennies so i would purchase from them again if the price was as good .
0	bought the dock last xmas for my daughter and it arrived on 0th_dec .
0	i wrapped it and gave it to her on xmas day .
0	on boxing_day the clock stopped_working , so i called pixmania customer_services on 0th_january on my return to work .
0	i was told by email that i wasn_'_t eligable for return as it was too late .
0	i called back them to complain and i was advised i would only get a repair done to the unit & i would have to send it back at my own cost to france !
0	i spoke to a rep for ihome here in england who advised they have refused to deal with pixmania directly , but they buy through other channels so they can '_t stop it !
0	he also advised me that pixmania would have claimed for a new unit , not a repair , so who '_s unit i would have had returned ( if any ) is anyones guess .
0	luckily for me he sent me a unit direct , however i feel that pixmania have got what they wanted and turned me away !
0	pixmania hides the fact that they are in france .
0	there is no mention of it anywhere on there site , indeed even the phone number is an 0000 number !
0	beware of these , they may seem cheap , but if it goes_wrong you will regret ever buying from these_crooks !
0	ordered friday_afternoon , and recieved the packet monday_morning , cant get any better - this combined with good prices , makes this my no 0 netshop for my kayaking gear
0	although the prices seem too good to be true and the website name doesn_'_t sound like one of a textbook shop , my order ( quantum mechanics by bh bransden ) was delivered within 0 week .
0	it '_s the indian version ( still 000_% written in english though )
0	there didn_'_t seem to be any other reviews of this site , so i just thought i ' d let people know it works , and is safe and secure :)
0	ordered a game and mistyped my address .
0	quickly informed by them , and once i had told them the correct address , the item was with me in under 00_hours .

0	i have bought two watches from watch_finder in the last 00 months .
0	both deals were professional , quick and as_described .

0	highly_recommended .

0	i ordered a canon 00 - 000_mm lens from mpb_photographic on the saturday .
0	the order was despatched on the monday and arrived by lunchtime on tuesday .

0	i love this website
0	when i have booked my trip to north cyprus pacific was the right place to for the car_rental , they have brought my car straight_away and helped_me to find out every place i wanted to go .
0	it is a very helpful and valuable company and i would definitely recommend a +++
0	this is really a joke of a company i dont_think one employee knows what the other is doing here . as im wrinting this , they were supposed to be doing a wet installation of a washing_machine that was supposed to be done last_week ... needless to say they have not showed up nor have they caledl the 00_mins ahead of arrival .
0	its 0 . 00 pm and accoring to their website they have installtion time 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 .
0	i was ok with sitting in waiting for them to come all day and they dont have the decensy to even call and inform that they are late .
0	i will never againg buy anything that requiers the " services " of this so called company .
0	pay that extra money and have professionals do it .
0	another weekend ruined by knowhow , ironic name by the way , they dont have any knowhow what so ever .
0	should change name to dontknowhow
0	delivery was great and swift , ordering was easy and i was kept_informed during the whole_process from order confirmation to receiving .
0	will_definitely use again .

0	i had a message came up with my last order to speak with a member of staff over live_chat .
0	i spoke with a lady_called emma and she was very helpful and polite and . manually entered a few details for me .
0	can '_t say a bad_word , item was with me within a couple of days and will_defo be ordering again .
0	pleasure to deal with and quick delivery , 000_% be buying my protein from these guy '_s . a +++++
0	top trumps , great service , helpful staff , great value for products bought and not forgetting delivery , 0 day !!!
0	a ++++++
0	will be using you guy '_s again !
0	fonebank gave_me a higher quote than any other mobile trade - in site .
0	the day after i sent my mobile off , they gave_me a confirmation_email and 0 days_later the payment appeared straight in my bank_account .
0	i couldn_'_t be_happier .
0	the glasses i wanted to purchase were extremely cheap and the exact pair / design i was looking for .
0	the postage fees were also fair so an overall bargain !
0	i expected to receive the items late , as they were making their way all the way from_hong_kong !
0	however , i was delightfully surprised when i came home just 0 and a half weeks after i placed the order , to find my new pair of glasses waiting for me .
0	the glasses were of an exceptional quality and i literally cannot_fault them .
0	i cannot_fault the company , their customer service and general services and i cannot_fault the products they have for sale .
0	i will_definitely be making another purchase from them in the near_future .
0	ordered an office desk from these_guys a month_ago now which has just arrived .
0	when i ordered i didn_'_t clock the delivery estimate of 00 - 00 days but when i realised i thought that must just mean the maximum_amount of time it will take them to deliver an in - stock item .
0	what i now realise is the desk was made to order , but still didn_'_t arrive within 00 working_days , it was more like 00 .
0	if they would just be honest and put made to order on their site it would have saved me a lot of annoyance .
0	customer service is good , they get back to you quite quickly , although they offered no apology for the lateness of the delivery even when i said i wasn_'_t exactly happy .
0	the desk itself looks very robust , the main top part is very heavy and is the only bit i have removed from it '_s packaging so_far .
0	it all seems well_packaged , so i '_m happy there .
0	all in all i '_m fairly happy but next time i make a purchase for office_furniture i will keep a closer eye on what they have in - stock and what '_s made to order as a month is a long time to wait .
0	i have ordered form them for years , any warranty problems are sorted quickly , items are dispatched in a reasonable time frame with the free delivery option and when your stuff gets to you its so well_packaged that even royal_mail can '_t damage it (.... mostly ).
0	prices are great too , not the cheapest but you do get a good service for your money .
0	you can '_t fault them .
0	i made an order on the 0th_march for a new graphics_card , it was about £_00 cheaper_than amazon so ever the skinflint i bought it from dealforu . co . uk .
0	their website stated 0 days for delivery on the product page and the info page stated most items are sent within 0 - 0 days .
0	i waited_until wednesday and decided to send an email to see when it will be dispatched .
0	no reply for two_days ( their website says they will reply within 0 day ) so i decided to check their reviews on google only to find out what i should have checked myself before ordering , that they are not the best company to buy from .
0	i also found that his trading ltd name , asm retail solutions_ltd , is registered to a residential street which likely means that it '_s a one man band ordering directly from the manufacturer .
0	and that they also used to trade on amazon , but no more which just helped heap my suspicion .
0	i decided to open a paypal_dispute , the dispute process did not allow meditation and went straight to the claim process which apparently means their account is frozen .
0	less_than 00_hours_later the claim was settled in my favour i assume by them giving me a refund or paypal forcing them to .
0	but i '_ll never know because paypal never tell you .
0	i also got a lovely email from the company stating my order has_been rejected .
0	what really annoyed me was that if they refunded me straight_away or paypal forced him to then the order was never even dispatched .
0	if i would have waited_patiently i wonder_how many weeks it would have taken to get it to me .
0	so all in all one totally wasted week , i should have just ordered from amazon .
0	next time i '_ll check a few reviews first .
0	easy , reliable , affordable
0	i was searching how to unlock my iphone for a year , i saw many scum websites , but yesterday i read one review about this site , i read and was surprised , so many reviews .
0	and i tried , i sent money via_paypal ( if this will be scum then i will got my money back ) so i sent money via_paypal , and after 00h i received email from them that my iphone are unlocked .
0	when i insert my sim_card i was stunned , my ibrick turned back to iphone , i instantly updated my phone to 0 . 0 . 0 ( from 0 . 0 . 0 for test ) and still working :) i forgot to say that they have very kind support .
0	thank_you so much iphone_unlocking team :) latvian !
0	hired a car for 0 days in germany , at the pick_up point they asked for eur 000 additional as i arrived 00_minutes earlier !!
0	just had a coffee to spare the minutes and finally got the keys .
0	looked easy at the drop_off as they just asked for the keys and no signature , no paperwork .
0	0_weeks after my return , i received an invoice for additional eur 000_,- with no details explaining the charge .
0	contacting the rental_cars by phone & email for over 0_weeks and finally they replied that i have used the car for 0 days ..::: 000 forwarding boarding_passes and airport stamps proving the 0 days stay and they are not replying to my emails any more !
0	!
0	anyway , a car advertised for eur 00 ,- ended_up eur 000_,- with no one to help ..!
0	!
0	will never trust this booking agencies and they are just bunch of formal thefts .
0	honestly i had my doubts_about mazuma , but , i have to say they are great .
0	whole_process from_start to finish is seamless .
0	customer_support is great !
0	always some one willing to help .
0	recommended to any doubters that are thinking of using any other similar company .
0	having dealt_with parcel0go for sometime i can_honestly_say that they have helped open doors for my business .
0	p_&_p premier plumbing is a local , independent company , the majority of our revenue is generated from footfall in the store .
0	having recently entered the world of ecommerce but not generating enough revenue quite yet to compete with the ' big guys ' parcel0go offer everything we need .
0	we started out sending 0 or 0 parcels on the odd_occasion , now we send out 0 or 0 a day and hopefully this will only grow and grow .
0	parcel0go are quick , easy and a pleasure to deal with .
0	martin , our regular delivery driver is a top guy and samantha in the office always goes the extra_mile to help us .
0	even today , one slight_error on my part was quickly and effortlessly resolved and that '_s very rare to find these days .
0	samantha answered my query within minutes and i was back on track !
0	parcel0go come highly_recommended and are an_absolute_delight to deal with , whether you are a one off or returning customer , choose parcel0go .
0	it started off well with good communication to say when it was going to be delivered .
0	it wasn_'_t convenient so i used the online tools to arrange_collection ( a bit of a drive away , but at_least i wouldn_'_t have to worry_about it ) - i received confirmation that it would be held at the depot for me to collect .
0	i then received an email_saying it was being delivered , so i contacted customer_care who sent me an email_saying they were definitely going to hold it at the depot .
0	000_%.
0	it '_s definitely being held for collection ...
0	you can probably guess it wasn_'_t at the depot when i arrived ( a 00 mile_round_trip out of my way ).
0	the depot staff told me it had been delivered " across the road , to the people with the golf ".
0	i arrived home and the only house across the road ( who incidentally don_'_t have a golf , and sadly , no - body on the street owns a golf ...) hadn_'_t received the parcel .
0	expecting a calling_card telling_me where it was , i went home but was again disappointed to find no calling_card .
0	so there i was , no calling_card , no parcel and no idea where it was .
0	cue another email to customer_care ( the phone lines were closed by now as it was 0000 ) but the form wouldn_'_t allow me to send 000 characters ( checked by two different word processor programmes ) as the error_message came up saying i could only use 0000 .
0	even adding the characters from my email , consignment_number and name , the total came nowhere_near 0000 ( 000 i think ) so why it wouldn_'_t let_me send it is yet another mystery .
0	i got an email back the following_day :
0	" good morning .
0	this item has now been delivered and was received by barker .
0	if this is not correct please contact uk mail and this can be investigated further ."
0	no mention of not doing as requested , no mention of my journey to the depot , no mention of the calling_card and no hint of an_apology .
0	it '_s a good job i know " barker " as they are the only people on the street who '_s surname i do know .
0	overall , this is not good enough at all and i hope they read this and take_note .
0	i shall also be calling them as , although you may have guessed , i am not overly happy with them .
0	most unusually i can '_t actually fault my experience with appliances_online .
0	ordered on a bank_holiday monday and paid for next_day delivery .
0	was kept_fully up to date as to when it would arrive on the tuesday and was contacted at exactly the time they said they would .
0	had a phone_call 00_minutes before they arrived , they dropped_off our new fridge , picked_up our old one and had left within 0 minutes - really impressed with their communication and the fact they did everything they said they would .
0	only took a couple of days to send the phone in and get the cheque back , jolly good !
0	i ordered my tyres on a thursday , during the snowy times when all uk garages couldn_'_t find any to fit my wheels , and they arrived on the following_tuesday .
0	very competitive_prices , couldn_'_t find them cheaper anywhere_else , and superb service , excellent !
0	i have used wheelspin on many of occasions for parts for my nitro truck .
0	but this time i called for help on purchasing a electric truck for myself an 0 yr_old upon a recommendation was made .
0	yet to run the truck but am always pleased and happy with help i recieve .
0	used them twice buying items from amazon , kindle get stuck at their delivery hub for 0_weeks ( replacement by amazon delivered by dpd no problem ) then next order couple days ago sent by amazon to their delivery hub at gatwick and disappeared .
0	customer service talking bullshit like " yes , yes we will send delivery tomorrow next_day nothing , next phone_call same thing tomorrow " order cancelled and replaced by amazon ( delivered by dpd on time messages about delivery time , online tracking extra service )
0	please for your own good do not use collect_+ >>>> ever
0	just have a look on other reviews this service is total trash
0	super_fast way to book a stay , look at location and see the reviews .
0	id recommend it if you dont want to waste time and get a nice place to stay easy , fast and reliably
0	my order was made on monday and arrived on the thursday .
0	very pleased with the items , nice price and still sealed .
0	will_definitely use juno for physical releases again very soon .
0	i was nervous to start as i had no t heard of this company , however they were friendly and reassuring .
0	the tickets arrived very fast and i had absolutely no_complaints .
0	the seats were great and i have already used this service again .
0	i '_ve come_across gamesbite before and after checking a few prices else where i was happy to go_ahead and purchase .
0	having used various so called instant delivery sites before i was more than impressed with the speed of delivery of my code .
0	took about 0 seconds :-).... very happy .. well_done !
0	being new to supplements and having tried a few products from various_places , bulk_powders have been nothing but first_class .... the sales guys are helpful and my order was delivered on time with no_hassle ... very pleased with the taste of the whey too :-) thumbs_up !
0	ebay clearly dont have the time nor the resources to deals with issues when they really hit the fan .
0	i am now out of pocket by nearly_£_00 . 00 due to a sale that went wrong and a lying buyer .
0	closing account asap .
0	****** s !
0	this is the 0th or 0th time i have used mazuma and yet again they deliver a hassle_free , easy to use service .
0	i always recommend to friends and family !
0	i would highly_recommend supplementwarehouse . com to you .
0	the price match_feature is awesome and allows you to get the best possible deal out there .
0	they were ok on price and stellar with delivery .
0	the lenses arrived the next working day & were packaged neatly with no_nonsense and unnecessary packaging etc .
0	i recommend them !
0	vetuk has all the products you might need for your_pets at competitive_prices .
0	we like to look after our cat_flea_treatment needs , and are able to get the proper treatments here without having compromising on less effective treatments from the supermarkets .
0	delivery is always fast and well_packaged .
0	they had the best price on our tv by a long way .
0	their web_site was easy to navigate and purchase from , and the free delivery was very fast .
0	i ' d easily recommend hills_sound & vision .
0	so bought an item paying next_day delivery on this .
0	sat there waiting all day for this and thought ok i will check how its going online and to my astonishment my parcel had been delivered .
0	from having a look round the front_door and checking with the neighbors i could confirm it clear had not !
0	after_speaking with customer_services they gave_me the drivers telephone_number and after calling him he clearly_stated he does not deliver to my area and an area 000 + miles_away from where i was .
0	called customer_services back and they confirmed the fact that some how my parcel with my address on had ended_up 000 + miles_away in the wrong depot , loaded on the van and given to some random member of the public .
0	now i have to sit and wait whilst a full yodel investigation takes place , leaving me £_000 out of pocket whilst they work out how to deliver parcels .... absolute_joke
0	love the shop , had a couple of issues on checking via_paypal , but soon resolved .
0	much_cheaper_than other online shops , would defiantly shop again !
0	!
0	found this a really quick and easy process and to top it off managed to get the game cheaper_than what steam was offering !
0	!
0	so after doing a cople of searches on google_shopping found this useless company selling the headphones cheaper_than any where else , now i know why !!!
0	!
0	placed my order on the 0th_dec and like many other comments on this thread took my money but order status was ' awaiting payment , after_contacting them via emailg got an email back from someone called michael saying sorry and the order will be dispatched right now .
0	that was on the 0th .
0	so gave them the benefit of the doubt and got to 00th and nothing so dropped them another email and got one back just saying ' sorry you should have it by tuesday , and now its tuesday and guess_what ..... still nothing , so off goes another email with more excuses to come my way .
0	looking at all the reviews on here apart_from nicecans putting fake_reviews on here surely this can be reported to trading_standards !
0	!
0	get no response then will be in contact with my bank and hopefully they can help and also southampton trading_standards !
0	!
0	it was easy to use , fast , and effective .
0	for a first time user the step - by - step process was quick and concise .
0	i found a cycling / running backpack from merlin_cycles via_google_shopping , as it was on sale .
0	i had previously never used them , but the backpack came extremely quickly with the free delivery !
0	needless to say , i '_ve had an excellent experience with them and will be using them in future over wiggle and chain_reaction .
0	i bought 0 microphones , and a zoom r00 desk .
0	i called gak and spoke to mike , a really friendly guy_who helped_me out with a student_discount over the phone .
0	i got all the products on the exact day that he said , and everything was absolutely perfect !
0	i will undoubtedly buy from these_guys in the future ( the near_future !)
0	and will suggest them to all of my audio - head friends ( a full uni course full of them to be precise !
0	).
0	thanks a lot guys !
0	i simply typed in my details and a pack arrived in 0 days at my door with a pre_- paid bag to send my phone back in as well as clear_instructions as to how to pack my phone .
0	the phone itself was , for lack of another word , fucked and they still paid a fair_amount for it !
0	thank_you very much mazuma
0	i had a few questions about sizes and materials and they answered very quickly combined with very quick delivery .
0	top_notch
0	don_'_t rent from this car
0	company .
0	the customer service that this company says is amazing is actually horrible .
0	they wouldn_'_t refund my money after i have booked a car and went to go pick it up on time only because i had a us license .
0	they were quick to taking my money but when the issue was explained and that is was a innocent mistake they gladly denied me .
0	when i called to explain the situation they were rude and condescending to me .
0	dont rent from them !
0	i '_m so impressed that i found gk0 there cheap , and very quick response time and cheap so i '_ll be deffenty getting more soon
0	so if you havent been to gk0 why not take a look for yourself and see what you can save
0	thanks guys , the service was great .
0	yodel let_me and you down , but phoned at 0am the next_day and you sent via your new better courier ups .
0	food was lean , plentyfull , fresh and tasty .
0	cant get enough !
0	great service , and really pleased it came in an unmarked box ... saving cost and not screaming out ...
0	i take protein to the neighbours .
0	not embarrassed but when have a huge box or two delivered people start talking when u have 00 " guns !
0	products good , service great ... use a good dpd courier compared to main rival , who_uses yodal who are more than useless ..
0	came complete with text tracking for free , so you dont have to wait about as they text you first thing with a 0 hour delivery window .
0	bought a graphics_card , arrived 0 days_later fully working .
0	what more could i ask for ?
0	cant_ask for better service !
0	ordered 0 new heatsinks and fans for my server , opted for the free shipping , and they sent the order next_day by dpd .
0	very happy
0	this site is the cheapest place i have found to buy digital games online .
0	they have a lot of weekly / weekend / daily / franchise / etc .
0	sales where you can get some of the best games around for very little money .
0	on top of this , they also often release discount_codes to get a further 00_% or 00_%_off most games , and 00_%_off pre_- order titles .
0	a lot of their games come as steam codes , which i do prefer as it helps you keep track of your game library easier and there is the added convenience of being_able to uninstall a game and reinstall it later without_worrying_about losing it .
0	some games , ( most_recent ea titles ), require origin .
0	a lot of games that aren_'_t on steam or origin require gmg '_s capsule_client to download and verify the games .
0	i have only used the capsule_client once , but i have no_complaints about it .
0	you can also trade in most games you download through the capsule_client - when you get bored of the game , gmg will give you some money back and remove the game from your library , which is a good feature .
0	there are some games i '_ve bought on steam in the past that i either don_'_t like or got bored with , but i '_m stuck with them .
0	gmg gives you the option to get a little money back for the things you don_'_t want to play any more .
0	i have bought a stupid amount of games on gmg since i discovered them and i have saved immense amounts of money by doing so .
0	as far as i can tell , this is the cheapest and best way to buy your digital games .
0	a lot of their prices rival the deals on steam .
0	i have been using shopto for some time now , and have received nothing bu consistently excellent service .
0	their prices are much_cheaper_than the high_street and 00 . 0 % of the time cheaper_than other online_retailers too .
0	pre_- orders often get delivered a day or two before store release_date , other purchases are usually dispatched same day and received the next .
0	they send you a little photograph of your order in the envelope with the delivery label on so you are confident in the knowledge that your order has_been processed and is on the way .
0	i have nothing but positive things to say about this company and have recommended it to many people .
0	if you ' re looking for excellent value , customer service , convenience and the opportunity to play pre_- orders a day or two early , then my opinion is that you should buy all your physical games from shopto .
0	we ordered with crampton and moore after_seeing the good price and reading good reviews .
0	we ordered 0 products ( fridge_/_freezer & freezer ) we were told after purchasing that the stated 0 - 0 days delivery would not be applicable to the fridge_/_freezer as it was from the manufacturer direct and it would be 0 days maximum , but that the freezer would be delivered within 0 - 0 days .
0	so here i am 0_weeks_later currently having my fridge_/_freezer installed with no freezer which was meant to be here over 0_weeks_ago .
0	now i '_m having to throw_away half a freezer full of food as it won_'_t fit in the new 00 / 00 split fridge_/_freezer .
0	won_'_t be purchasing from crampton_& moore again , nor recommending them to anyone .
0	this may be an_isolated case , as they have had good reviews prior but i am obviously left frustrated with ther service .
0	supplement_warehouse is a great site .
0	anything you need they have at wonderful prices .
0	customer comes first .
0	online staff is excellent .
0	nothing more to say , best site out there hands_down .......
0	cyclesense have been my go - to bicycle shop since i can remember .
0	they haven_'_t let_me down once , sourcing products , parts and clothing quickly .
0	know their stuff and are chatty , helpful and always looking to go that extra_mile .
0	definitely the best bike shop in the area by far .
0	made an order almost a month_ago for some bike chain cleaning spray .
0	i chased it up ten days_later and got a half - arsed email back saying they would look into it and let_me know what was going on .
0	heard_nothing .
0	chased them up again , having to go through social_media to make_sure someone was actually dealing_with my order .
0	got another half - arsed email back saying they were hoping the product would come in stock in a couple of days .
0	over the weeks it has taken for them to source this product , i have had a replacement bank card , so when they have finally tried to charge me , it hasn_'_t worked anyway .
0	if they had the product in stock in the first place , it wouldn_'_t have been an issue .
0	communication and their stocking system has_been seriously disappointing .
0	it '_s a shame because i had previously enjoyed shopping with them .
0	the site was easy to navigate and had all the products we needed
0	found the laptop i wanted here £_00 cheaper_than elsewhere .
0	decided not to bother with the 0 day delivery and went for the free 0 day .
0	ordered friday_morning , took delivery monday_afternoon !
0	would definitely buy from them again , and recommend to friends .. or anyone for that matter
0	absolutely despicable , paid £_00 to have a discussion about the meaning of the word loss and when it applies from .
0	apparently you have to tell the police and your insurance company within 00_hours of the last time you saw an item , whether you think you '_ve lost it or not ... if that '_s to be the case , then the police will be getting a lot more calls from now on .
0	this insurance company on the other hand won_'_t be getting any more calls , at_least not from me .
0	i feel let_down , it really seems like they ' re happy to take your money then run .
0	to anybody reading these reviews , please , please make_sure you pay attention to the fact that almost every review on here is from people who have only just opened a policy with them .
0	it '_s very easy to like the company when they provide such a hassle - free and cheap way of starting a policy , but as with everything , you get what you pay for ... in this case you don_'_t get very much , not even the cover you think you '_ve bought .
0	fantastic service , great price .
0	particularly_appreciated the phone_call to let_me know when my product would be delivered .
0	will_definitely use again .
0	had an old laptop and was checking out sites to see if i could make a few_quid , stumbled on this web_site .. and im very glad i did .. !
0	the whole_process was very quick and efficient and i was told what was happening at each_stage , payment was made just as quickly , i will not_hesitate to reccommend sell your - laptop to family and friends and in time will be using them again myself .
0	after going through our requirements with wiredworx we decided to utilise an ' open source ' website design which meant that as_opposed to starting from scratch all we needed to do was to customise our design .
0	after that was done the website which was created allowed for us to enter all our products and manage orders in a very easy to use way .
0	basically in less_than a month we went from no site at all to receiving multiple_orders a day !
0	ahhh yes , that '_s one other thing we can really vouch for - whatever they have done meant that we are listed very highly in google etc for loads of our products !
0	thanks guys !
0	no problem at all
0	i have never had any trouble with shipping or quality of products .
0	this site offers pretty_much any supplement you could need and makes sure you are happy with their service .
0	you cant expect to spend less_than 00 bucks , but if that was your plan , how good a quality of product do you think you would get .
0	very happy with the service and site , looks nice , acts nice , easy to use .
0	as a college_student , this site is perfect and the deals make it easier to get the products i want .
0	i would never recommend talk_talk ever , rude customer service told my wife to shove it over the phone and there just complete idiots , yes you might save_money but pay for what you get .
0	lowest_prices .
0	make_sure you take full advantage of their price match .
0	very good service .
0	one that undercuts the local retailers on the renowned ' backstreet stalls ' which also charge £_00 + and demand to take your iphone off you for 0 days .
0	very easy to pay and very quick and efficient service with an email_notifying you straight_away once the unlock is complete .
0	i highly_recommend this service not only for its ease , efficiency but also it '_s quality being an official apple unlock which stays permanently unlocked for the future .
0	0 / 00
0	i phoned these_guys monday lunch time .
0	was given good honest advise in understandable english .
0	placed order 0 :_00pm monday_afternoon online
0	received full vaillant boiler kit 0 :_00am wednesday_morning as agreed
0	boiler engineers who fitted boiler also impressed with service & highly impressed with price .
0	as i work on a service desk that has won lots of awards for providing quality service .
0	i am more then happy to recommend the service provided by the tdlonline guys
0	spoke to dianne via live help today .
0	to clear up some queries on a tracking_number that didnt work .
0	within 0mins i knew what was going on !
0	she was very polite and i cant_fault her !
0	promote this woman !
0	i tried this pre_- workout powder yesterday , and it '_s an_absolute beast !
0	in the first place , finding what i wanted was just a breeze because their website is so user_friendly .
0	i had a small problem with deliveries at my end , so i contacted the website and that same day they replied with an ideal_solution .
0	having taken it , you just feel totally pumped , focused and totally full of energy ; the ideal state for an intense workout .
0	afterwards i was buzzing from the feeling of having pushed myself to the very edge and willing to do the same next time .
0	i will be buying this again , and would recommend it to anyone_else .
0	the welcome to the website is second - to - none .
0	the design is immediately attractive with bright_colours and an incredibly intuitive layout .
0	there are easy to follow guidelines and information that got me up and running with online bingo in minutes .
0	searching for my ideal site was also a piece of cake as i was able to filter results by virtually any means i wanted .
0	one problem with many other comparison_sites , is that to get the best offers i have to register an account .
0	with this site , there is none of that trouble !
0	no_hidden_fees and no hassling registration requirement .
0	what a breath of fresh_air !
0	never have i seen such a large and varied collection of top bingo sites in one place .
0	it was really comforting to know that i was getting results from all of the corners and depths of the internet .
0	i was especially chuffed to see that along with the fantastic sites listed , i could get exclusive offers with the bingo sites through using this website .
0	overall i had a very enjoyable_experience , and also find myself with a much more enjoyable bingo website after my visit .
0	would highly_recommend to anyone .
0	i '_ve ordered several_times since i found this store .
0	there '_s was a shipping error once and they immediately fixed the problem and made sure i was happy with the result .
0	they also included free extras with some of the orders , which is always nice .
0	will_definitely recommend to anyone who '_s interested ...
0	brilliant customer service .
0	i ordered ram on a friday and i actually made a mistake on my order .
0	i emailed customer_support straight_away and they replied on monday_morning ( i wouldn_'_t expect a reply over the weekend ) corrected my order and also answered several questions i had .
0	the ram was with me by wednesday .
0	the ram was good quality kingston modules and worked_perfectly !
0	i '_ve tried every food delivery company in the area and ocado have simply been awesome .
0	ability to pick an_hour_slot = awesome , they ' re iphone apps = awesome , freshness promise = awesome , next to no substitutions in 0 years as a customer = awesome , no_quibble refund for occasional damaged item = awesome .
0	love them , would never change , you pay for the service and quality you receive !
0	over the years i have had a number of items from them and have never had any_problems .
0	customer service is great , prices are competitive and delivery is quick .
0	they have a great selection of items , i '_m always able to find what i want .
0	this is my go to store for any tactical_gear .
0	i was advised by yodel via_email on the 00sep that the delivery would be made ' within the next two_days '.
0	therefore having previously experienced issues with yodel i checked the parcel tracker , which advised the parcel was ' out for delivery '.
0	as both myself and my housemate were in , i was pleasantly_surprised that i wouldn_'_t have to reschedule anything in order to accept the parcel .
0	however , at 00 : 00 i receive and email_advising ' sorry we '_ve missed you '
0	despite_being in all day , with no attempt made to deliver the parcel and being advised that a ' missed call card ' had been left in our letterbox ( which once again was not the case ), i '_m still without the parcel .
0	i '_ve rescheduled for thurs and no doubt once again i '_ll be posting the same comments then .
0	this is not the first , or even second time that we have been in all day and yodel have advised they '_ve tried to deliver , left a missed call card etc ...
0	when they havent !
0	we live in a small flat with a door_bell loud enough to rival big ben .
0	this company is simply useless , with drivers advising they '_ve attempted to deliver when then haven_'_t .
0	i will not be using online companies who use their ' services ' in the future .
0	to start i had reservations_about sending my mobile off , but these were to be short_lived .
0	mazuma mobiles customer service was simply outstanding .
0	and the most_important_thing ...
0	the full_amount originally_quoted for my phone was in my account the same day i received confirmation from the post_office that they had received the handset !
0	if you want a customer to post a review now , and dont pay for trust_pilot , then that customer must pre_- register or be prepared to use their facebook account .
0	many of my customers are not happy to do this , so may have to look at dropping trust_pilot as a preferred review site .
0	its not that it is expensive , but i dont like being held to ransom .
0	to make it hard for customers to place a review really goes against what i feel a review site should be doing .
0	please make it easier for customers to post reviews and then maybe i would be happy to sign up for additonal services .
0	service was ok . couldn_'_t advise delivery time .
0	only deliver once a week on a saturday .
0	not the best tbh .
0	didn_'_t install it as website advised .
0	brilliant service , brilliant communication / work effort .
0	would recommend to anyone
0	not cheap but it is convenient .
0	i '_ve just pg0 a few_times in the past and never had issues ( i '_ve even recommended them to friends and family , but it '_s often said that you don_'_t know how good or bad a company is until you hit a problem .
0	here is a overview of a issue i have just had with p0g ( this is a extract from the live_chat on there site , although i '_ve lost their responses )
0	hi there ,
0	this is in regard to order number p0g - xxxxxxx , which i have had an issue with
0	i '_ll give you a full history of what has happened so that you can see where i '_m coming from .
0	i placed the order on the 00 / 00 /_0000 with a collection date of 00 / 00 /_0000 .
0	on the 00 / 00 /_0000 at around 00 : 00 the tnt driver refused to accept the package as it was not in a cardboard_box ( it was securely bagged and taped however ).
0	i contact you via your live help system within an_hour of the driver refusing the collection to see what my options were .
0	i was advised that unless the item was correctly boxed , then the package would not be accepted .
0	on this basis , i was told the best thing would be to cancel the collection , accept a refund ( i was even offered an extra £ 0 credit if i took an p0g account credit ) and re - arrange the collection with someone_else .
0	so , this is the course of action i took and i had an email confirmation that the refund had been requested by 00 : 00 ( less_than an_hour after the refused collection ).
0	i then arranged for an_alternative collection via another courier ( actually a man with a van service )
0	it then seems that the following_day ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) that the same tnt driver came back to collect the item again and this time accepted it ( without_any changes being made to the packaging from the previous day ),
0	this is despite the fact that i had cancelled the collection with yourselves the previous day .
0	the item was the delivered to my workplace on the 00 / 00 /_0000
0	today is my first day back in the office and the package was waiting for me as expected , however i '_ve now got another company wanting to charge me for wasting their time for attempting to collect a package that has already been collected .
0	so a situation has_been caused_by p0g not cancelling the collection as agreed .
0	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0	the customer_services were just not interested , they seem to think that it '_s acceptable for their driver to pick_up an item 00hours after the order had been cancelled and don_'_t care that i '_m now looking at charges from the alternative courier i booked .
0	i '_ll make_sure that i , or anyone that i know , never use this company again .
0	paul mccaffrey
0	yes some of their prices are great but my god their customer_services are shocking !
0	i paid for 00hr delivery my item turned_up a week_later !
0	i then contacted the head_office to complain and all i was told is because it '_s a franchise operation it '_s not their responsibility and nobody can be held_accountable talk about a fob off .
0	if you can try to avoid shopping with them online !
0	they lied to me about shipping my item by a whole week .
0	in the end i rang there head_office up to complain as there staff in the store on the phone where so rude .
0	this was one of the worst online shopping_experiences i have had to date !
0	i ordered a single cutaway electro_acoustic + accessory_pack on the 00th_december and as promised it arrived on the 00th_december well_packaged and in perfect_condition .
0	this was my 0st order and i was slightly_sceptical_about the quality of the product given the price tag of just over £_00 , however i am pleasantly_surprised , the finish and build quality is far better_than i expected and it sounds pretty good to .
0	all in all i don_'_t think i could have asked for more and this certainly won_'_t be my last order
0	best price i could_find , quick delivery of post pack and transferred the money to me quickly too .
0	absolutely satisfied with the communication , the product quality and value for this price .
0	the shipment took a bit longer and was not initially indicated when the order was made but received notification from customer_support in time .
0	in overall i recommend for everyone .
0	this was the first time i used servicing_stop , and i am absolutely satisfied with the service received .
0	the pickup of car is extremely convenient , and its delivered quickly .
0	the service price is also much more cheaper .
0	customer service is helpful , and quickly responding .
0	only had the invoice a bit delayed , however fully_satisfied .
0	thanks a lot .
0	easy layout and navigation , clearly_displayed items so no confusion as to what you ' re getting .
0	incredibly speedy delivery , and items in pristine_condition with flash removed from sprue .
0	highly_recommended for any purchases .
0	just ashame there '_s often not what you want in stock !
0	no one can beat supplement_warehouse '_s prices and if the do just let them know at the time of purchase and they will beat them !
0	wasn_'_t sure if this was a good idea at first , but since several friends suggested it , gave it a try .
0	overall , couldn_'_t be more pleased !
0	:) quick response , and the support for russian titles is spot on , will be using again ( as a matter of fact , just used them again today : p )
0	people should use this service , it '_s cheaper_than retail and is completely reliable .
0	the fact i constantly receive e_- mails to remind me of what florist company i will never use again is annoying , the one time i attempted to use iflorist the delivery failed at first - basically it wasn_'_t delivered at the desired date and time , so i contacted the company , not by phone to speak to a person , but by email , which is also ridiculous , surely the company has an office where someone can answer a phone ?
0	the second_attempt to deliver my flowers to my girlfriend also was forgotten about , so naturally i contacted the company once again .
0	by this time the flowers were going to be a week_later than the desired date ( which wouldn_'_t really have impressed my girlfriend , being one week after her_birthday ) therefore i demanded a refund , the only thing the company successfully achieved during this order .
0	i used this company on more than one occasion wether it was to get my iphone mended or to have the colour changed and everytime they were professional , quick and very well priced .
0	i wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else .
0	can '_t beat this website on price and speed !
0	can '_t beat the prices .
0	i shed 00_% bodyfat and placed 0th place in the natural mr . universe contest open men '_s medium height division because of the great prices and supplements from this site !
0	i paid travelup £ 0000 for tickets to phuket ( from london ) and received an email_saying that the payment hasn_'_t gone_through .
0	i then followed the instructions and attempted a second payment .
0	i received confirmation of payment from sagepay and travelup .
0	the next_day , i received an email_saying that payment hadn_'_t gone_through .
0	i forwarded my confirmation and they said ' oh_yeah it has_gone_through you '_ll received an e_- ticket in 00_hours .
0	0 week_later they call to say that they can '_t sell me the ticket for that price because they took too long to process the booking and they '_ll refund the money to me .
0	my flight is in less_than a month and tickets are now more than £_000 extra .
0	the man on the phone wouldn_'_t even apologise and said it wasn_'_t his fault .
0	always go to f0 for my tyres .
0	great service .
0	never trouble to fit me in on the day i call .
0	never an argument on price ; just match the same as before without_question .
0	friendly staff .
0	clean building and waiting area .
0	no_complaints .
0	where do i start ... 0 terrible customer_services .
0	0 , 0g service non_existent almost since 0g launch .
0	robotic uncaring a damn right rude agents in the filipino call_centre ( hardly tmobile uk )
0	at the end of my contract after being over charged i was promised the overcharge refund between 00 - 00 days ... 00 days no refund , call to ask where it is then to told minimum 00 business days .
0	00 business pass .
0	still no refund .
0	customer service couldn_'_t care less .
0	avoid at all costs !
0	we '_ve been looking for a new place recently and found it easy to navigate all the houses available in our area without having to go to multiple websites .
0	really useful !
0	my girlfriend and i were reluctant to try and book our own taylor made holiday incorporating all of thailand by ourselves until we stumbled_across this website .
0	agoda have virtually every approved hotel in thaland on their books and payments are secure and safe using their hotel vouchers as proof of payment .
0	obvioulsy having thais facility at out fingertips made booking simple easy and well within our budget .
0	i would have no_hesitation in recommending their services to anyone .
0	i even changed dates on one of the hotels and as the excahnge rate was better on the day i booked i was then given a rebate .
0	can '_t wait to go on holiday now and write_reviews on all of the places we stay !
0	have been purchasing threadless now for a few_years .
0	i live in the uk and it always has great service as well as amazing desings .
0	i have found the best thing is in summer when you spot someone_else with a threadless t - shirt - you know they know what you know !!!
0	!
0	defintely recommend :-)
0	i have now used getmein four times - twice to buy and twice to sell .
0	the site is easy to use and if you price the tickets right you can make a little money as a little bonus .
0	i have also found that on the two occasions i have purchased tickets , they have been very last_minute and i have found tickets under face value .
0	- once for take that - ( not for me but for my girlfriend and browney points !!!!)
0	and the other time for maverick sabre - tickets were half price - he '_s brilliant live !
0	i was initally sceptical , but found that they are part of ticketmaster which pretty_much gave_me the reassurance i was looking for , i don_'_t think any other company i looked at where you can buy and sell tickets was associated with a reputable online ticket shop .
0	would definitely recommend :-)
0	unlike_some travel companies - james_villa_holidays went the extra_mile to ensure our holiday was the perfect one .
0	the booking process was simple and easy .
0	the arrival and condition of the villa was immaculate and the holiday was perfect .
0	thanks to everyone_involved .
0	we will_definitely be using them for our next holiday and would highly_recommend to anyone .
0	always a little_cautious when ordering meat off websites but a few pt '_s recommend musclefood .
0	orders 0kg of chicken_breasts and all i can say is wow !!
0	they are huge , minimal fat and the price is much_lower_than any supermarket even with an offer on !
0	packaging was excellent .
0	will_defiantly recommend !
0	cheers musclefood !
0	i have been using a competitor for ages and decided after browsing this website i would give it a go as they look professional , unfortunately not !
0	i placed an order thursday_morning at 00am which qualifies for next_day delivery however it is tuesday and it still_hasn_’_t turned_up !
0	sent countless_emails to customer service to ask what is going on with my order but i am yet to hear from them not to mention spending 00 - 00mins everyday trying to get through to them !
0	for my first order i can safely i will avoid this company like the plague !
0	worst customer service i have experienced and if this is how they treat a new customer then they don_’_t deserve mine or my companies business !
0	i booked a car for pickup from cape_town airport earlier this april ( 0000 ).
0	when i arrived at the desk i was told , even_though i had already prepaid for the car , that i could not place a deposit on the bank cards i had available .
0	i offered to pay the deposit in cash or on an embossed debit_card , as i have done numerous_times before .
0	all of these payments were refused and i was told i could claim a refund from rentalcars . com .
0	i wrote an email_explaining the situation and only received a reply 0 days_later stating that i had been charged a cancellation_fee of £_00 . 00 !
0	the price of the initial hire .
0	i aim to further escalate this complaint and would advise consumers to use the numerous other car_hire websites available .
0	absolute_rubbish customer service ,
0	- they tell_lies to customers regarding their products
0	- they hide information_regarding after sales ( things like returns or exchange policy ) from customers .
0	- staff is abusive and even misbehaved with even female customers
0	be vey very very carefull before you buy a product from them
0	i bought 0 laptops ; one in 0000 and one in jan - 0000 .
0	orders were smooth .
0	arrived ontime ; products were great .
0	even aftersales service was fantastic .
0	i had to claim money back from toshiba .
0	unfortunately i lost my invoice .
0	i rang the after sales and they send me the invoice through e_- mail even when i was on the phone .
0	very good and fast .
0	and these_guys are cheaper as well .
0	goooodinternet ...
0	perfect supps ..
0	every time i '_m in the mall or another vitamin shop and come close to buying something i look at my phone and check the prices here ... its always cheaper !
0	i '_ve never had it not be !
0	it '_s really amazing and i recommend this place to anyone who is going to spend money on supplements !
0	and i always get a free_shaker !
0	best place ever !
0	i have been buying my entire bsn stack from supplement_warehouse for over 0 years_now .
0	i have gone with nitrix , syntha - 0 , no xplode , cellmass , and atro - phex .
0	they have saved me over $_000 consistently each order , and the products are my edge in the weight room !
0	everytime i purchase i will go with one of their free_samples , shaker_bottles , or pill containers .
0	such a great deal .
0	great technical_support over the phone & tester arrived on time and well_packaged .
0	i would recommend to anyone .
0	just completed my first order and the prices are great .
0	and i got a ton of free stuff .
0	i '_ll be waiting for a big box to come to my door !
0	can '_t speak highly_enough of these_guys .
0	great products , great knowledge , great offers and free_samples of protein .
0	amazing
0	this company can '_t seem to read sizes or be able to tell the difference_between white and black .
0	very very disappointing , and the customer service is no better .
0	all done over email , all i wanted to do is speak to someone , but no .
0	first issue was that i paid for next_day delivery as i needed a tie to go to wedding abroad .
0	got an email on the next_morning saying that my order wouldn_'_t arrive , it would the day after .
0	unbelievable .
0	when it did arrive , the white shoes i ordered were the wrong_size .
0	i contacted them and they said send them back for a refund .
0	i didn_'_t want a refund , i wanted what i ordered .
0	so they dispatched more .
0	this time they were the rifght size , but instead of being white , they were black !
0	no remorse really , they just told me to send them back for a refund and gave_me 00_%_off my next order .... my next order ...... yeah_right .
0	never again will boohoo see a penny off me .
0	avoid at all costs
0	great price , got my specs in 0 days .
0	can '_t go_wrong
0	stumbled_across eyewear_outlet when i was looking for some now oakley_shades for my holidays .
0	all i can say isthank you .
0	cheap as chips , bset value i '_ve seen anywhere and arrived next_day and foc postage .
0	only problem is that it '_s too cheap not to buy stuff .
0	i was so impressed that i '_ve ordered more items ( boardies , cap , backpack ) perfect for a month in australia .
0	i '_ll look uber cool without having spent a kings ransom .
0	highly highly_recommended
0	item came quickly and was well_packaged .
0	will buy from again .
0	skiddle is a great site for tickets they have tickets for allsorts of events
0	a good site . to get all . your idevices fixxed , even coloured : d highly recommendes
0	thanks emma , was in a right muddle !
0	great service !
0	great site .
0	easy to interpret
0	i '_m so glad i stumbled_across this site !
0	with a friendly , helpful hotline - they were more than happy to answer my questions .
0	that , coupled_with the really fast delivery .
0	i would recommend this site to anyone !
0	my parcel went missing so contacted live help spoke to richard_mileham who give me all the information i needed on an email to progress further with my missing parcel and only took a few_seconds to sort_out .
0	can '_t recommend the teste more for what it is it '_s like going to mc ' d and getting a milkshake with just water !
0	having not heard of money for your phone my wife was apprehensive_about using them .
0	however they were offering the best price so i went for it .
0	got the free_postage envelope quite quickly and sent my phone away .
0	i would recommend using recorded delivery for security although i myself did not use this .
0	i received an email to say they had my phone and quickly received another to say it had been tested .
0	i was given a date fro payment which wasn_'_t too long a wait and it went in as they said with no issues .
0	tune up is one of the finest product ... no it '_s the one and the only one i might use and trust to tuneup my pc and that unquestionable fact for me .
0	unfortunattly moment '_s after purchasing the product with a general offer in the website ( 00 . 00 $), two new offers in row appear to me first through the uninstall with ( 00 . 00 $) which was oky for me not that far from what i '_ve paid but then after i installing the new version i had another offer for ( 00 . 00 $).
0	that was totally unaccepted .
0	t shirt arrived very quickly , was replaced with a smaller_size and sent to another address equally quickly .
0	will use again for all my climbing needs !
0	legends !
0	i '_ve only been into the supplement game for about a year now , but i '_ve been shopping around and no other retailer has as comprehensive a selection or prices anywhere_near as cheap .
0	always has good service .
0	use chemical and juno for my 00 '_s
0	i have used juno since_0000 when my local hmv stopped_selling records .
0	since then i have had excellent service from juno .
0	they have not messed_up a single order and vinyl always arrives in excellent condition .
0	i have also returned at item with no_hassle .
0	the online music player to listen to new records on the website is also excellent , you can listen to the weeks releases quickly and easily .
0	all in all i think the best online shop for buying tunes .
0	i ordered two_pairs of glasses which took directsight over a month to process .
0	when i received the first pair the arm on the left was too loose and the right arm too_tight causing the nose_pad to press against my nose causing me a headache .
0	i returned these and ordered a new frame .
0	while waiting on these my 0nd pair arrived and these were flaw free .
0	i got the 0st pair replacement soon after .
0	i could not see through these and the right arm was loose .
0	after a large number of emails with the company owner who refused to replace the 0nd pair and never even acknowledged these were the wrong prescription , i got these back in the post , arm repaired but still could not see through them .
0	steer_well clear and if you don_'_t when you do get your glasses and there are faults return them only for full_refund .
0	i can '_t do that because i binned my old glasses after i got the 0nd pair and i need them to see when working and driving .
0	the customer service was virtually non_existent after it became_clear i wasn_'_t backing down over manufacturing_defects and all they kept saying was i had to pay more money if i wanted a replacement .
0	they give good prices even if your laptops missing bits .
0	they are always communicating on the progress of the deal and inform you if the price is changing ( and that '_s if they are increasing it not just decreasing it ).
0	all in all can '_t complain .
0	it '_s a nice , friendly and efficent service .
0	the title_says it all .
0	for me they made so , etching that could be very complex very simple indeed .
0	from the user_interface to the communication it couldn_'_t have been easier .
0	0_star service .
0	well_worth the money .
0	thanks guys .
0	always a quick dispatch and excellent products for competitive_prices .
0	been using them for years and have never had a problem .
0	to keep it simple - i made an order on the tenth of april .
0	it was out of stock but wasn_'_t listed on the website ( like any competent company would do these days .)
0	i sit there waiting for ten days and ring up to get told this information and that it has_been dispatched .
0	it has now been three_weeks and i have not received a thing .
0	never , ever again .
0	instant delivery , no_problems with product , all in all a recommended seller .
0	dude you have to order from supplement_warehouse they have the cheapest supps and and will beat any price if you find a lower one .
0	get bigg !!
0	!
0	its just quick and simple
0	delivery was fast and the products were brilliant

0	my delivery arrived promptly and i had no_problems with any of the parts supplied .
0	i cannot give an opinion about customer service as i had no need to use it .

0	haven_'_t been dissapointed with any purchase and love the company :).
0	i '_m using giffgaff for almost 0 years .
0	to be honest the first year was good but since_0000 problems and problems ...
0	i '_m looking to get my pac_code now and transfer my number .
0	my advice to you avoid
0	i ordered underfloor_heating less_than 00_hours ago and it arrived this morning which is especially impressive as i live on an island .
0	delivery was free as well !
0	we called to check this and a really lovely person called us back to confirm .
0	information on what was suitable to buy was excellent .
0	i '_m doing my bathroom up at the moment and delivery for items have been a nightmare and very costly (£_000 in some cases ).
0	will use them again for sure and will recommend them to anyone i know looking to install under_floor heating .
0	well_done !
0	would use again .
0	good prices and spend of delivery .
0	great experience overall and i would recommend chillisauce 000_% to anyone_else wanting to organise an event with minimum headache .
0	it will be my go to website for this sort of thing in future and i will_definately recommend it to friends .
0	thank_you !

0	i have been paying £_00 . 00 for just broadband and calls with nothing extra .
0	i called them up and they told me i can get the same exact package for £_00 . 00 .
0	funnily i have been paying this higher price for more than a year and they never informed me about this .
0	i ordered some parts for my car a few_days ago and they arrived yesterday .
0	i was a little_worried as i couldn_'_t really find any detailed reviews online regarding the company but i had a positive_experience myself with no_problems .
0	emails were send to me when the items were posted and the correct sealed parts arrived without_any damage .
0	i needed a stylus for my 00s national panasonic unit which was very hard to find .
0	i found it on this website for £_00 + £ 0 pnp .
0	i ordered it on thursday and it came on saturday so very quick service .
0	it was well_packaged and i am happy with the stylus .

0	i would recommend hifi - tower to anyone who loves quality product , excellent service and perfect communication .
0	amazing product with best recent technology .
0	thanks for the services i received from you .
0	not only is the website excellent , but the pricing of items is very very competitive across the web .
0	normally i would not go for the cheapest place i can find an item online , but purekit ( webtogs ) are such a strong brand i do not think i could shop elsewhere in the future without checking their site first .
0	in the event , the rab_jacket i ordered was too small , but the returns process was very efficient and very simple .
0	unfortunately , due to the christmas_rush , they were sold out of the next size up and instead of a refund or alternative item , they went straight to rab and sourced a single jacket for me - tremendous service !
0	bought the latest ipad & iphone cases for my wife , got them on " free economy delivery " which said they ' d be there in 0 days - was expecting them on friday but they arrived tuesday
0	i was very please when i started_using my laptop , and with the speed of service , it arrived a day earlier_than i expected .
0	the quality of the laptop and it '_s componentry is second to none .
0	i was amazed when i researched laptops of similar specs , to discover that pc_specialist were a good £_000 cheaper .
0	i will be planning on using pc_specialist again , when i need a laptop or pc in future .
0	bought a bannerstand from these , great value for money , brilliant print quality and outstanding customer service .
0	will_definitely recommend these to anyone !
0	!
0	excellent service best prices good money and they pay quick
0	i was being a pain by asking to collect the gear from them directly as i was in a rush .
0	they said as a one off they ' d do it .
0	they bent_over_backwards making_sure all the bits would be ready for me to collect .
0	i am very grateful , especially to jade .
0	a service like that will_definitely make use them again .
0	thanks again , giles .
0	i was only after dome lampost keys .
0	had them in stock and where delivered within 00_hours .
0	well priced and you get a free keyring !!!!
0	would highly_recommend .
0	heinnie is a place you actually can trust .
0	i have never had any_issues with them and always had prompt delivery .
0	friendly people and great prices they are my first stop when looking for a new blade .
0	this site is great .
0	all the supplements you will ever want in one place and for super cheap too !
0	my son is a huge wwe and undertaker fan , and loved wearing his undertaker costume on halloween .
0	i was a little_nervous making an order 0 days before halloween , but it came back the next_day , and was pleasantly_surprised .
0	thanks for great and fast service .
0	i love myprotein , everytime i order from them its always fast delivery of top quality suppliments .
0	i hope these_guys stay around for a long time , and keep the prices lower_than where i used to buy my protein .
0	so thanks to myprotein , keeping_me topped_up with good products and not breaking the tight seal on my wallet , matt .
0	i applied for my phone to be sold on sunday , and unbeliveably the money was in my bank wednesday
0	clear and easy to use website , fast delivery and the best price around .
0	very impressed , highly_recommended .
0	i '_ve been an orange customer for years - i '_ve had all_sorts of problems from niggles with rude customer service to being_overcharged by £_000 .
0	they make it as difficult as possible to complain and when you do , it '_s unlikely you '_ll receive a response .
0	yet i get a reasonably good deal and when someone calls me , my phone rings - which is what i want from a mobile provider .
0	it '_s a sad state of affairs that i fear orange are amongst the better networks for customer service , so i '_m happy enough where i am .
0	we use waitrose online weekly and our shopping always arrives on time - there are hardly_any substitutions and the delivery drivers are always friendly and courteous .
0	we ' re winemaking novices and found the wineworks website to be about the most helpful one out there .
0	plenty of simple advice and videos and a quick response to an emailed question .
0	the kits have everything we need so there '_s no additional_expense , and delivery was next_day ( free of charge ) - really impressed and will be back for more .
0	just one suggestion : a new video_showing the making of the premium wine kit in the superior kit ( the two items which are promoted on your page when you click " wine making kit ") - even_though the written instructions are really clear , it '_s good reassurance to see the process on video and be able to check what you ' re doing is right .
0	i hear a lot of talk of people buying things from gnc ( the worst place to buy from , so expensive ), or bodybuilding . com .
0	it never_fails , every time i mention free items , my buddies say bb . com offers free stuff too , but they don_'_t say how you have to spend over a $_000 before you can receive a " free " gift that you can get from supplement_warehouse by only buying one item .
0	plus , they have the lowest_price guarantee of which they will deduct even 0 % more from the price if they don_'_t have the lowest_price .
0	and don_'_t worry_about your order , they have always processed my order the same day and received my order within 0 days ( if not sooner ).
0	if you are like me , i will spend hours searching for the best prices and comparisons .
0	even after the shipping_costs , you will still save_money , and then to include the free_gifts .
0	hands_down the best place to shop !!

0	my first order from argos home delivery was last june when my partner and i moved_into our own home together .
0	we did this knowing that we would need to save to buy a lot of the furniture whilst we were there .
0	so we bought our bed from another company which we had within the first week and had enough left over to order our couch .
0	after_scouring the internet , we found the desired couch on argos ' website .
0	we promptly ordered it and had a waiting time of three_weeks , which we had expected and were fine with .
0	my father in law surprised us with a last_minute trip to barcelona and agreed to sit in on delivery day and receive the couch .
0	so there he sat , 0am to 0pm ( as the delivery notes stated ) but no couch came .
0	when we came back from our holiday we called argos .
0	apparently the couch had been out of stock the whole time and even prior to my payment being made to a human on the phone .
0	long_story_short , after_speaking to an abrupt , rude woman on the telephone , i received a full_refund and found the couch on gumtree from new at £_000 less and received it the next_day .
0	move forward over a year .
0	i am_currently sat waiting for a set of weights ( which i ordered tuesday and paid an additional £ 0 . 00 for saturday delivery between_0am and 0pm ) which does not seem to be arriving .
0	i tried to use the order tracker , but that isn_'_t working at the moment .
0	so i '_m out of pocket just shy of £_00 , no sign of my purchase arriving and they '_ve had the utter nerve to ask for £ 0 . 00 saturday delivery ( the exact words on the website ).
0	i am absolutely fuming .
0	argos , what are you playing at ?
0	very , very & very excellent deals with .
0	faster searching & great result .
0	very informated to us
0	instant , easily but not so completed collection
0	bought star_wars : the old republic .
0	as i had never_heard about this site , i was a bit scared to buy from them .
0	but i went_ahead with it and received my star_wars £_00 cheaper then it should be and it came instantly !
0	i would recommend to anyone !
0	i am really impressed with this website and the quality of products they supply .
0	we recently ordered a set of bathroom mixer_taps from this website and they arrived the very next_day .
0	they were just as_described on the website and fitted easily into the place of the old one .
0	always competitive and fast easy service .
0	guy arrived in mobile kwikfit mobile van .
0	he was friendly and obviously knew what he was doing .
0	he provided an excellent and fast service .
0	00 / 00 in every way possible .
0	the first windcheater i bought needed replaced in december_0000 ( about 0_weeks after it was bought ) as the pocket lining has come_undone .
0	now barely 0 months later , the exact_same thing has happened to this second windcheater .
0	i will have to look out my receipt and hope the store replaces it as i need pockets in my jacket ; however i can ’_t help but think the same thing will happen again .
0	the pockets are extremely poor quality !
0	i '_ve seen quite a few bad_reviews here lately not sure if all are true .

0	surfdome is a great company .
0	being from south_africa where i was used to buying surf branded clothing any time i pleased , made living in england very difficult - not to mention the change in climate and the lack of waves at beaches !!!
0	when i discovered surfdome , it came as such a relief and i struggled to keep back the tears !!!
0	thank_you for providing such a variety of surf brands , all in one place ; where my need for surf branded clothing will always be catered for !

0	i ordered a parcel from drinksdirect consisting of several dessert wines to be delivered to my girlfriend at her address slightly more than a month_ago .
0	however , after 0_weeks without_any delivery , i realised that something was remiss , and checked the parcel tracking_link .
0	to my astonishment , it said that the parcel had already been delivered at a time and date when my girlfriend and her friends were still at home .
0	i immediately contacted drinksdirect via_email to inform them that delivery had not been made , and also checked with the neighbours if they had taken delivery of the parcel ( which they hadn_'_t ).
0	i was informed by drinksdirect that delivery had been taken by a male , despite the fact that the only male tenant at the address was not present at the time of delivery .
0	additionally , it was clear that the delivery man had not made the effort to ensure that the parcel was delivered and signed for by the correct person .
0	funnily_enough , drinksdirect responded that " the delivery driver is adamant that the delivery of the order was made to the correct delivery address .
0	they have also checked the gps details logged when the order was delivered and they have advised that the gps records confirm delivery at the address specified with the order " despite evidence to the contrary ( delivery was supposedly taken by a male who could not have been present ).
0	additionally , there were 0 female tenants in the house who can stand witness that no doorbell was rung and no delivery was made .
0	there were repeated_attempts to convey the message that we had not taken any delivery , and repeated refusals by drinksdirect to take any responsibility for the failed delivery ( by insisting that the delivery had been made despite the lack of a proper signature or any concrete proof that the delivery had been made to the correct address and that " we require any losses or damages to be reported within 0 days after delivery ").
0	during this time , there was a noted delay in responding to my emails ( 0 in 0_weeks without even an acknowledgement of receipt ), almost as though drinksdirect hoped that i would forget about this issue .
0	after a full month of increasingly frustrating communication , i have sent drinksdirect a formal letter of complaint ( dated 00th_march ) asking for either the delivery of the parcel or a refund .
0	it is at this point where there is a clear demonstration of drinksdirect '_s standard of customer service , or rather , lack_thereof ; there has_been no response to my letter , no acknowledgement of receipt and no communication from them for 0_weeks now .
0	i am now out of pocket for over 00 pounds and was not able to enjoy the wines which i had ordered for a very special event .
0	drinksdirect has blatantly ignored my claim and has not dealt_with this failed delivery satisfactorily .
0	for these reasons and those stated above , i have made this complaint a matter of public record .
0	buyer_beware ; it is all well and fine if the couriers made the delivery to the correct address , and if someone from your household takes the delivery for you .
0	but if there is a failed delivery , drinksdirect will take you for a ride and will ignore your claim .
0	surprised by the level of poor reviews of ebuyer on here ... certainly does not match my experiences .
0	as the old_adage goes , you '_ll only hear from the unsatisfied customers !
0	have been ordering with them since_0000 , a few major items a year , like laptops , tvs , etc .
0	most recently placed an order for a samsung 00 " tv and xenta soundbar with next_day delivery .
0	order was placed at 00pm and i had the goods in hand at 0pm the next_day as promised .
0	in this case the price beat the high_street even with the most expensive p_&_p added !
0	i have experienced many couriers being used by them from citylink , to yodel most recently , all of which have been on - time .
0	would be nice if they could give the tracking_details in the despatch email , rather_than having to log - in to retrieve them .
0	i used mk diagnostics for my last 0 mot '_s and service , i always recommend them to anyone looking for a reputable , honest and reliable garage .
0	i '_ve_used a number of garages in my 00 years of driving and they are by far the best .
0	my car is due a service soon so i '_ll be popping in again in the near_future .
0	my girlfriend really wanted tickets to the beach_boys 00th_anniversary show at wembley arena on 00th_september .
0	tickets were sold out everywhere and places that did have them sold them for almost double the price !
0	so i found this website and they had two tickets for a very reasonably price .
0	i had never_heard of this company and wasn_'_t sure if i wanted to take the risk , but i went for it and tickets arrived after 0 days of ordering !
0	very happy with the service and the pricing .
0	0_stars !
0	00 / 00 !
0	despite going for the free super_saver delivery , my order arrived within 0 days .
0	more_importantly , as the order was to be delivered to my work address , the packaging was discreet .
0	the prices compared_favourably to other internet pharmacy options ( e . g .
0	boots online ).
0	i will most certainly use pharmacy0u again .
0	like all the other ( genuine ) reviews on here , i sent my iphone_0gs 0gb off to cash 0 phones , which was in fairly good condition .
0	on receipt , they reduced their offer by over 00_%, and charged £ 0 to return my phone to me when , unsurprisingly , i rejected their offer .
0	it remains to be seen whether or not i ever receive my phone back , and i will be reporting them to the relevant agencies .
0	please never use this company .
0	had no_problems with that company .
0	received a passport the next_day after embassy despatched it .
0	courier came at 0 : 00 am .
0	i even wasn_'_t at home and he left the parcel to my neighbour ( i share a flat ).
0	i think you need to track you item regularly and be sure that somebody will be in you flat , or you can put you work address .
0	very good shop .
0	simply amazing service .
0	ordered at 0 . 00pm on 00 / 00 and picked_up from home at 0 . 00pm same day .
0	this is simply amazing service .
0	will use again and promote to all my friends !
0	i can '_t fault the savings and service i had from blackcircles . com .
0	you ' d be an_idiot not to go with them for your own tyres .
0	i was quoted £_000 for each one of mine and had them supplied and fitted from blackcircles . com for just over £_00 each .
0	brilliant !

0	wow it '_s perfect to get your iphone_unlock :)) i really thank_you team officialiphoneunlock . co . uk for unlocking my iphone 0 that '_s locked into orange uk :)))) its great job :)) and it was for a very short time , only 0 days :)) i really thank_you
0	have used chillisauce for 0 stag dos now ( newcastle , bournemouth and nottingham ) and they been brilliant everytime .

0	can '_t complain at all .
0	yodel was supposed to be delivering my phone from carphone_warehouse .
0	after being told via_txt of a delay with the delivery it wasn_'_t the best start .
0	i received a txt the next_day with my tracking_details and then just a few minutes later another txt with a different tracking_number .
0	i tried both on the yodel tracking page and of course neither worked !
0	tried both contact_numbers and as expected just an instruction to tell me to use the website ... which doesn_'_t work .
0	like previous reviews i too am wondering when or if it will arrive at all !
0	wish companies as big as carphone_warehouse were not using yodel as they are clearly a cheap option and judging_by carphone_warehouse trust_pilot score this is effecting their customer service as well !

0	company does not reply to any emails !
0	i wish i could give 0 - 0 !
0	e & l cycle insurance , eta cycle insurance and cycle cover were all extremely_helpful and i would advise any of them !
0	i sent an email enquiry to info_@ argos on the 00 - 00 - 00 regarding a weights bench and its compatibility with a certain set of weights .
0	i received an automatic reply from them with an enquiry number telling_me to allow 0 working_days for a response ... i did not receive a response so sent the email again ..... i actually received 0 enquiry numbers ( catid000 , arg0000000x , arg0000000x and then 00000000 ).
0	i was told on two occasions that a member of a different department would be able to answer my question ....... by the time they got back to me ( 00 days and four enquiry days_later ) i had the answer from a different company so purchased through them instead .
0	i wanted to apply for an argos_card as i was after a new bed , some drawers and i thought whilst i was there i would look into getting some new gym_equipment .
0	i have never had trouble in store .. but that maybe due to the fact that i have never needed to ask any questions about the products i was looking to purchase .... please do not use their online service !
0	i was using play . com for over 0 years and i purchased 000 items over that time until they lost 0 items needed for christmas despite ordering in early september !
0	i had to call customer service multiple_times as i had been charged and after 0 months of going back and forth i was told i had to wait three_weeks to report it lost from the day of despatch which was in december !... i was only refunded after multiple emails and calls in which i received terrible customer service speaking to people who clearly has no idea what was going on !!
0	i have since been using amazon with no_problems at all and i would recommend their services above play any day !
0	a pain and stress_free process of transferring from contract to pay as you go .
0	they refunded me £ 0 straight_away for a mistake that i had made with not switching off mobile data on my phone , occurring £ 0 .
0	i have never really had any_problems , only minor which have been sorted_out quickly .
0	the website is clear and the online_chat is quick and so much_easier than speaking on the phone .
0	they have a good selection of phones to choose from .
0	you were informed at each_stage of the process .
0	they gave_me a decent price for my netbook .
0	payment was very quick after the item was processed and checked .
0	i was very pleased with the service and would definitely use again .
0	never had any incidents while avast has had my back and as a web developer , i spend a lot of time on the interwebz :)

0	code recieved within 00_hrs , there was a couple of steps missing on the instructions , but as there was a link to a video_tutorial that sorted the issue i had .
2	i contacted them and was given excellent advice with no sales_pitch and i felt i could trust the company .
2	the price was very competitive and much_cheaper_than some better known_brands .
2	the kit arrived very quickly with a complimentary continuity checker .
2	there were instructions included but i found some even more comprehensive detail on the website .
2	i fitted a 0 msq 000_watt mat version which was my first and everything_went as planned .
2	i did take extra care in positioning the thermostat probe because i have heard of them failing and want to be able to retrieve and replace if necessary especially as they are reasonably_priced .
2	we put mapei self levelling compound over the matting which made the tilers job much_easier .
2	all test results are correct and a short live test shows the tiles are becoming aired which is all i require .
2	all_round excellent experience thus_far .
2	thank_you .
2	i have dealt_with this company on many occasions they are not only knowledgeable , but always try to help you and succeed every time , now on my 0th purchase and would recommend them to anyone , 0 **** a +++, well_done .

2	i called aspect . co . uk to check and repair my boiler which the pressure kept falling .
2	the engineer attended and visual checked the boiler for half an_hour .
2	he left , then i received an email that i need to remove boxing to give access to vpr which seems faulty .
2	next_day they charged my card for £_000 !
2	it mentions £_00 for one hour plus £_00 for material plus_vat .
2	i called the accounting department several_times to clarify why they charged me for material whilst the engineer just had a visual check and they promised to come_back to me which never happened .
2	i still have the same problem with the boiler and lost £_000 just to receive an email that my boiler has a fault !
2	it is just a ripp off .
2	they get the details of your card at the first place and then charge you whatever they want !
2	one of our pa_speakers packed up on saturday .

2	thank_you , whybuynew !

2	been with orange for over 0 years and compaired to other mobile companies i have found them easy to deal with ,
2	not often but if i do have a problem they are there to sort it out .
2	tyre checker were by far the cheapest provider for the tyres i wanted .
2	most garages were quoting £_000 - £_000 per_tyre and i paid just £_000 for the same tyre .
2	will use again !
2	ordered cooker , hob , extractor_fan , sink and taps .
2	all arrived ok .
2	very pleased with the brand_names at the price we paid .
2	free delivery a bonus too .
2	although we have yet to fit the items as the new kitchen is being fitted next week , at the moment i am very pleased with the service .
2	fingeres crossed they will work when fitted .
2	i have ordered many things from zavvi , and mostly everything has_gone_smoothly .
2	i ordered 0 items at the same time , 0 of these items i waited weeks for to be despatched but they said they couldn_'_t take the money from my card , so i went online and hit resolve , entered my security details and all went through ok .
2	reconciling my bank_account a week or so later highlighted that they had charged me twice for the item once on the 00th_november_0000 , once on the 0rd_december_0000 .
2	i phoned customer_services ( 00_minutes of which 00 were on hold ) and the customer service rep was fairly useless .
2	they started telling_me that i needed to photocopy bank_statements to prove it .
2	i bank online i said , they told me to ask my bank to send me a statement .
2	i was told a manager would call me back in 00_minutes after his lunch , nearly 0 hours_later i am still_waiting .
2	poor customer service negates discounted prices especially at £ 0 . 00 plus per phone_call to them stick to amazon , play or hmv all who have very good service , deal with you correctly ( and respectfully ) and have good prices too .
2	poor customer service is a sure way to go out of business ...
2	again !
2	!
2	so often these days customers are seen as expendable and many companies overlook the importance of good customer service , not so with speckyfoureyes .
2	it is extremely heartening to find a company who values the customer above and beyond the money they spend .
2	my high_street_optician gave_me an incorrect prescription which resulted_in varifocals being made that didn_'_t work .
2	despite this being the fault of the optician , i was advised by speckyfoureyes to have another eye_test and , at their expense , they remade glasses for me that were correct .
2	i think it extremely unlikely that many other_companies would have done the same .
2	the staff are knowledgeable , helpful and friendly and i will_definitely be buying from them again .
2	i would highly_recommend speckyfoureyes to everybody looking for glasses online , so if you have any_doubts or concerns about buying from them , don_'_t have , because they don_'_t come any better_than this .
2	i have shopped online with merlin for a few_years_now and can_honestly_say that i have never had a problem .
2	great value .
2	great sales and an excellent range of bikes and components .
2	i would unreservedly_recommend merlin to all cyclists
2	john
2	absolutely the best on line bike shop there is , i have bought everything from here , from wheels , crank sets to bar_tape , great bargains , excellent gear and just 00 euro to ship from germany to ireland ... and very quickly , friendly customer service and above all cycling friendly , this is more than just a bike shop , it is a cyclists shop , whether you are building a bike from scratch or upgrading bike 00 has it all .
2	great site , easy to use , plenty of choice and great bargains , i have been using this site a long time and cannot recommend it enough .
2	i live in ireland where everything is twice the price it is on the continent .
2	i buy from probike shop because they are professionals and are so user_friendly
2	the site is very well built and easy to navigate .
2	they sell everything including the small bits and pieces you need to customize_your ride .
2	i have been with probikeshop two years_now and never had a problem with an order
2	i would recommend this site to all riders road , mtb and bmx
2	i ordered a nz short_sleeve jersey and after 0 days the order was still processing , i tried three_times to e_mail bikeinn but to no_avail , i tried_calling by landline and mobile but ... you guessed it no luck , i submitted a complaint to paypal and lo and behold an email from bikeinn telling_me i had successfully canceled my order ?
2	i did not cancel any order , however they told me my money was put back into my account , it would take 0 to 0 days ?
2	after 0 days i again tried to contact bikeinn , suffice to say no reply and no money , paypal had to refund my money in the end ... do not buy from bikeinn , i tracked the order , they source on other_sites and sell to you at a profit .
2	i think that on a scale of ten i would rate my pharmacy at 0 and possibly the full ten , it is user_friendly , customer aware and very well stocked , there is no interrogation as to what you need over the counter meds for , as there is in our new drive to stop medication use by private users in order to force people to go to a doctor and pay possibly 00 or 00 euro to get 0 euro worth of medication
2	i had an issue with one of my domain_names i have registered with 000 - reg , i couldn_'_t find my login_details anywhere .
2	i contacted them via their " ticket " system and they couldn_'_t have been more helpful !.
2	we found the account , but the login was from a really old email address that i used to join 000 - reg .
2	i '_m up and running again !
2	a big thank_you to customer_support :)
2	would certainly recommend this company on phone keeping you up to date with proceedings , excellent service would recommend to all .
2	j a clark .
2	this company is brilliant , driver waiting in foyer with name , very friendly , helpfull , also return_journey , pickup on time , great conversasion with driver on way to airport , excellent english .
2	this website is a scam designed to separate you from your money .
2	whatever you are thinking_about how good the price or the website looks forget it , it '_s all just a scam .
2	they have no stock and will only give you the run around , avoid at all costs .
2	i bought a black and decker rt000 ka wizard toolkit rotary tool .
2	i was attracted_by the promise of 00 fittings which i thought would mean i ' d be set_up to do lots of different jobs but in fact that means you get a pack of 00 sanding_discs , a pack of 00 grinding discs and a few odds and ends .
2	the tool itself looks and feels quite useful and sturdy , i haven_'_t had the chance to use it in anger_yet though .
2	0 iphones , 0 ipad and 0 ipod all skinned .
2	love the choice of designs too .
2	fantastic reliable service .
2	order mon - thu for next working day and you will be .
2	free delivery over £_00 .
2	this is my fourth order and won_'_t be my last .
2	can '_t rate them highly_enough .
2	i have purchased a lexmark 000 series printer for my office .
2	it is an excellent machine , just what i needed and it was competitively_priced .
2	it arrived the day after it was ordered as promised .
2	very impressed !
2	provided a replacement mains_power_lead and transformer for my macbook_pro .
2	the price was £_00 less_than oem from apple and appears to be better quality - apples own_brand cables wear through too easily .
2	i have signed_up to topcashback , the idea is good but i can not find any offers worth taking part in .
2	the cashback_rates are generally low and full of terms and conditions , and i can not find anything worth purchasing from the traders taking part in the scheme .
2	if there is a special_offer on with one the traders your cashback is severally reduced or eliminated altogether .
2	i would like to purchase an ipad_mini from a retailer which will cost me £_000 . 00 and the best cashback deals works out at just £ 0 . 00 !!
2	!
2	none of the people i recommended to sign up thinks it is worth it .
2	would someone explain how you can get even £_00 . 00 back without spending £ 0000 '_s
2	mark bowles
2	ultra_fast service , best price , great product !
2	what more ?
2	?
2	best price for my item anywhere . free_postage and delivered less_than 00_hrs after ordering . outstanding .
2	superb service all along the way ; online booking went like a dream and the documents arrived within minutes - and the holiday was fantastic .
2	great price and arrived next_day - and way cheaper_than buying from the vet too .
2	what more can you ask for
2	could not have asked for better service .
2	accepted the quote , received the free post envelope , posted the mobiles and received the money - all within one week .
2	i have no_reservations in recommending mazumamobile to anyone .
2	dave .
2	bury_st edmunds .
2	product came on time works well
2	next_day delivery impressive no_problems noted
2	good communications good price fast delivery
2	nothing much to say other than its a great place to shop online , i live on a small island 0 hours from scottish mainland and the guitar i ordered arrived earlier_than i thought , was really well_packed for what can be a perilous journey for any parcel .
2	the guitar itself was set_up beautifully , just the way i wanted it , if i ever need another guitar or anything musical iwould try merchnat city music first .
2	i was after one of these epiphone short scale basses second_hand for some time , but guitarguitar had one brand_new at a price that was a real_bargain .
2	ordering was a doddle , and the guitar came securely_packed exactly when they said it would .
2	i would definitely recommend this shop and service to anyone .
2	ordered my new epiphone eb0 bass on friday and it arrived , post free , on the following_monday as promised .
2	what a great company to deal with .
2	very highly_recommended .
2	thanks guys ,
2	david
2	derbyshire .
2	the prices for the oakley_goggles i bought were fantastic and the service was excellent .
2	i needed the goggles the next_day and they arrived in the morning .
2	this company can be highly_recommended .
2	by far the best value for the product we bought - with free p_&_p and speedy delivery , i would recommend this company without_reservation .
2	first_class !
2	chauffeur waiting for us as we arrived and a minimal wait on our return .
2	very friendly and at a price that was extremely competitive .
2	if you want fast efficient service at an affordable price you won_'_t do better_than petmeds .
2	when i first came_across this company online i phoned them for information_regarding thier large dog kibble & whether it would be suitable for my two german shepherds .
2	i spoke to a very nice young_lady on the phone who was very helpful & she confirmed that it would be suitable .
2	i then placed an order & i recieved my order very quickly .
2	my two dogs love the kibble & i would highly_recommend this company to anyone_else with dogs .
2	i regularly shop at aldi because the quality is excellent & the price is good .
2	i ordered flea_treatments for my dog & cats from viovet & the price was good , the delivery was fast .
2	i would recommend viovet to anyone .
2	i like many people always check on line - low and behold it '_s normally amazon who comes up with the correct price for you to pay ... and whats even better is that postage is normally included in the price ... so you win all_round cause they guarantee it will arrive and any dealer within the amazon group is bound by the same practices ... so you cant lose ... i recommend it the house ..
2	dear gerard ,, thanx so much for the plant which arrived this morning , and so many_thanks that the message i put to be sent with the plant was done to the letter ... moreover it was done in gold lettering and my wife was very pleased indeed .... with the plant and the lovely hand_written message .... we will_definitely deal again with you company ... thanks again for a perfect on line service ...
2	john .. les in cornwall england
2	bt should learn that customers don_'_t want to wait hours trying to speak to someone in india !
2	we all have enough frustration in our day to day lives without getting it from bt .
2	probably the best retailer in the country . not cheap , but always the highest_quality in product and service .
2	always find the item you want and always at the keenest price and always quick delivery .
2	excellent service and quality item , packed well and delivered on time , not a lot more i can say , but would use them again . thanks
2	i was recomended parcel0go and very impressed with how easy the website was to navigate to sort_out my collection and delivery and most impressed with the choice of companies to use .
2	realised a had made a mistake and decided to use the livechat service .
2	kate saved the day and changed my order details within a few minutes and fixed the error i had made .
2	thankyou so much kate for helping_me and i cant_wait now to recieve my delivery from ups .
2	these_guys are good !!!
2	great stocks are held and they are honest as to whether item is in stock or not .
2	delivery is fast and always as promised .
2	had small locking_nut missing from my korum chair trolley and this was replaced within 00_hours .
2	prices are always competitive as i shop around several sites before ever placing an order - always end up placing my order with tackleuk .
2	highly_recommended for their prices , stock_levels and customer service .
2	always excellent
2	it speak volumes about their attitude to customer service when a business that receives negative criticism has to resort to personal abuse of the customer who has the temerity to complain .
2	yes i got angry with them but not without provocation .
2	their so called " expert ", roy , told me professionally qualified people such as architects are thick and can '_t programme thermostats , it was then i told_him i wasn_'_t thick and quoted my qualification to prove it , he said he was sorry for me .
2	i think roy was showing a chip the size of canary_wharf there .
2	the " expert " roy had written to me telling_me how to set_up the thermostat which i duly did and it still didn_'_t work .
2	what they haven_'_t told you is that it was with those settings that it went off with a bang when " expert " roy plugged it tin to test it .
2	the simple point the " expert " roy still can '_t grasp is that a thermostat that has_been working_perfectly for 0 months has to have something more than the setting wrong if it suddenly stops working .
2	they supplied me a replacement thermostat of a different model but the touch_sensitive screen isn_'_t very touch_sensitive , i wont go back to them to listen to " expert " roy tell me its my inadequately stupid fingers that are a fault .
2	instead i will spend the £_00 or so needed to buy a new thermostat from a more reputable_company , i cant face dealing_with this lot again and receiving more insults .
2	the lesson i take away is not to ignore negative_reviews as i did in this case from another customer that had a similar experience of the underfloorheatingstore . com
2	excellent product , superb delivery , well_packed
2	look no further if you need quality bags for your business , backed_up by next_day delivery , at very good prices , thanks
2	the brackets i bought were just what i expected and were delivered very fast they were also the cheapest price i could_find .
2	thanks for a great efficient service .
2	fast delivery but i thought the product was a bit over priced .
2	i bought a universal cradle for my iphone and ipad . it works just fine and was delivered very quickly .
2	thanks for a great service .
2	ordered late tuesday , delivered thursday .
2	great price , fully recommended .
2	purchased new putter at a bargain price from justgolfonline - service was first_class , easy to order and swift delivery .
2	simple process , great value and ups were first_class when delivering the item .
2	they were professional guys who couldn_'_t help you enough .
2	highly_recommended
2	received a call one saturday saying that they were from orange and wanted to discuss my upgrade options .
2	i listened and said that i was interested in a deal .
2	they said they would email me details and send out the iphone .
2	shortly_after this call i received a call from orange ( who were and still are my provider ).
2	they said that they hadn_'_t called me and asked whether i gave out my orange password to which i said i hadn_'_t been asked for it !
2	i then tried_calling back the number that appeared on my mobile but it rang then cut me off .
2	i tried and tried .
2	in the end i left it and decided that of any phone arrived , i would refuse delivery and send it back .
2	in the meantime , i agreed a far better deal with a far better iphone direct with orange .
2	on the day my new orange phone was due to be delivered , i get a phone from e0 !!!
2	no emails , no other contact and they don_'_t ( i hope ) have any bank details for me !
2	i accepted delivery as i thought it was my other phone from orange ( which turned_up about 00_minutes after the e0 phone ).
2	i called them and looked at an account they sent up on the website .
2	the advisor was rude and unprofessional .
2	i have sent the phone back by special recorded delivery at a cost of £ 0 to me .
2	i am_glad to say that my new shiny iphone_0s is working_perfectly from orange ( no upfront cost to me as loyal_customer to orange !!)
2	and was a far better deal than what e0 were offering ( iphone_0s )
2	so don_'_t be_fooled_by the sales_tactics .
2	don_'_t be_fooled when they say they are from your service provider .
2	avoid !!
2	!
2	ordered two contract iphones for my twin daughters .
2	ordered , processed and accepted friday_morning with a delivery date of following_tuesday .
2	later on the friday received an email_saying phones would be delivered on saturday .
2	they arrive at 0 . 00 saturday .
2	super quick and painless_transaction !
2	i recommend this firm .
2	oh and two happy daughters !
2	exactly the parts i needed in stock , quick delivery , fair price - what more could i want ?
2	the website told me exatly what i needed for my particular computer , the price was as good as anyone_else online , i ordered about 0pm and it arrived in the north of scotland next_day .
2	what more could anyone want ?
2	well_done mr_memory , and well_done too royal_mail !
2	these_guys are great - have all the bits to repair an appliance for a few_quid when comet etc would just take £ 000s to seel you a new one .
2	website is good and even states whether the part is genuine or a third - party replacement .
2	used then several_times , only once was delivery more than a couple of days ( to scottish_islands ) so they score well there too .
2	will undoubtedly use again ( next time something_goes_wrong ), but hopefully not too soon !
2	bought a new vito 0 years_ago .
2	after 0 . 0 years / 00 , 000_miles , the rear_brakes siezed solid , due to corroded sliders .
2	took it back to the dealer for repair under_warranty and got a bill for £_000 .
2	apparently the brakes are not included in the warranty , even for a malfunction .
2	contacted mercedes uk , who said yes , the dealer was correct the brakes are not covered by the warranty , even for a malfunction , as they are a " wearing part ".
2	this is my first ever mercedes - needless to say it will also be my last .
2	i have used this company many , many_times .
2	as a few others have said , it would be good if they had a wider_range , especially more high - end stuff .
2	but if they have what you want , they will deliver it fast , and usually cheaper_than screwfix .
2	on the odd occaision when something has_gone_wrong , customer service has always been very quick to sort things out .
2	yes , they do sell a few very cheap items , but you get what you pay for - where ever you shop .
2	used to be my one - stop - shop , but since the kingfisher ( b_& q ) takeover prices have gone_through the roof .
2	guess they don_'_t want to take business from b_& q .
2	on the upside , service is still good , but now it '_s always worth_checking toolstation et_al as someone_else will usually have the same thing cheaper .
2	heavy_duty gate fitting really are heavy_duty - not like some other_websites !
2	pricing is good & free delivery to the highlands is a big plus .
2	arrived when stated , fitted_perfectly and a spare slat !
2	will_definitely use again .
2	very easy to take out cover , online forms s doddle to complete and all done in minutes .
2	the item i ordered was delivered very promptly , especially as it was immediately after christmas .
2	communication was good and i will_definitely use ironmongery_direct agin .
2	i used wimdu . co . uk for the first time in march_0000 for a 00 night stay in budapest .
2	my trip was for dental treatment .
2	the prospect of two_weeks all alone in a hotel_room or apartment did not appeal one little_bit .
2	so i played around with several sites and wimdu jumped out as being the easiest to use with a good visual layout and a great selection of rooms .
2	eventually i chose a room in a family apartment where the adults and two kids all spoke english .
2	great choice !
2	i had a fabulous time and we became good friends – because of the duration i guess .
2	the wimdu system worked_perfectly .
2	what i liked about it :
2	- ability to create a personal profile that explained the purpose of my visit to prospective hosts and a little about myself
2	- easy to ask questions
2	- good filtering_options for selecting what you need in room , like elevator access for visitors with mobility issues
2	- the deposit is not taken until the host accepts the booking
2	- it ’_s ease of use and adequate level of detail about the rooms and hosts
2	now i am planning a trip to barcelona with a companion who has mobility issues .
2	already i have narrowed my search down to two lovely apartments .
2	really pleased with the speed of responses from the hosts to my queries and how little time it took to find what i want .
2	i was really nervous_about this transaction as i always check reviews on companies that i have not dealt_with before and there were a significant number of issues over poor service being flagged online , especially about goods not being in stock or as promised .
2	also , the offer on the printer looked too good to be true - and you know what they say about deals like that .
2	i tested the water by sending an email to customer service asking if the website sock level was actually correct and if the item was there ready to ship as i said i needed it urgently .
2	after an instant automated_response i was surprised and encouraged to get a personal response just a few minutes later confirming the item was in stock and ready to ship and advising of the delivery options if i needed it quickly .
2	encouraged by this i decided to take the risk .
2	the item on a four day delivery was here within two ( which meant i was not in but the dpd online delivery tracking allowed_me to easily re - book for the next_day and that gave_me an eta of between 00 : 00 and 0 : 00 and the doorbell_rang at 00 : 00 !)
2	so_far , the printer is working_perfectly , doing exactly the job i bought it for and set_up on the home network with no issues .
2	now all i am waiting for is for ricoh to honour the cashback offer which also looked a little weird as the model number was not on their cashback application although oyyy website did highlight this and assure me the claim will be honoured .
2	if that all happens i will have a network ready , colour_laser_printer with 0000 sheet cartridges installed for just £_00 - actually not too good to be true !
2	( breathes a sigh of relief )
2	instructions were clear , everything worked as it should , email follow - up to advise of each_stage of order , delivery , receipt , payment etc all operated as promised , payment arrived promptly with no issues at all .
2	would definitely use again
2	great service
2	the laptop battery failed after 00 months into a 0 year warrenty and batteries - trade . co . uk would not send a replacement battery .
2	instead they offered a replacement battery at reduced cost which i reluctantly paid for but it never arrived .
2	i think they were trying to delay things until a paypal ' claim time ' expired .
2	i am smarter than them and got my claim in before the deadline date and paypal refunded from their account .
2	they did not answer mine or paypal emails and so batteries - trade . co . uk should be avoided at all costs .
2	the name on the company is ' chan chi wang ' and they are not uk_based but honk_kong .
2	this is the last time i will deal with them or the far_east again as i would rather pay extra from a uk company .
2	as the song goes my battery was on a ' slow boat from china ' avoid , avoid , avoid at all costs ."
2	always buy my cartridges from the cartridge_shop as they are excellent value , they are also as good as any others out there .
2	bought a guitar for my son in law on the monday and it arrived on thursday .
2	he is over the moon with his present .
2	.
2	dawsons_music kept me informed all the way from purchase to post .
2	thank_you
2	bought a set of 00 brush_heads for the 0rd time , very pleased with the service and the product .
2	after trying some of the so called ' top named ' antivirus protection .
2	i stumbled_upon bullguard .
2	literally instantly , as soon as i loaded it into my computer it found all_sorts that these fancy dan wannabee '_s didn_'_t .
2	i have used it for the last 0 years and i can_honestly_say it does the business every time .
2	i recommended bg to our office staff after taking work home on a memory_stick that bg immediately flagged_up for being full of virus '_s .
2	they bought the software and were amazed at the amount of malware that was present .
2	fantastic bit of kit that is sooo easy to install and use .
2	with online assistance available to boot .
2	i have had no_problems with expedia , i find the website easy to navigate and always find myself browsing areas of interest , sometimes nothing to do with my original request or destination .
2	long may it continue to provide a quality service with a competitive price .
2	straightforward website , prompt delivery and best value from my quick check with others .
2	excellent service - best price
2	i was somewhat_sceptical when i checked out the details of this company .
2	their " registered address " is a leafy cul - de - sac !
2	however how wrong i was .
2	first_class service and communication_throughout the whole_process .
2	they said it would be delivered in 0 business days , and it was delivered in 0 .
2	would seriously_consider these for my next gaming purchases .
2	i have used victorian_plumbing before , and would readily use them again .
2	the choice on their website is excellent , the actual site is really easy to use and comes with all of the details and specifications of any product you purchase .
2	delivery was very quick and goods arrived really well_packed to prevent_damage in transit .
2	from the ordering_process , right through to the delivery there has_been nothing but excellent service from pc_specialist .
2	first_class communication right the way through the purchase .
2	computer itself is excellent , exactly_what i wanted .
2	used broadband choices for years to monitor speeds .
2	offered speedtests from other reputable groups but broadband choices immediately compares the suppliers .
2	gives simple and clear_descriptions of services to make the choice that suits yous needs .
2	i always highly_recommend broadband choices .
2	i place orders several_times in rugby season .
2	these orders are always delivered correct and on time .
2	if there are stock issues i receive a call and the compromise is always very acceptable .
2	i used to buy equipment from the digital_village catalogue when they were still music village .
2	they '_ve been pretty good over the years , but i do think they might be upping their game .
2	the last purchase i made was easy to find and process on - line with a useful embedded video to explain its purpose , swift payment system , with good comms on my email querie and exact in terms of delivery time : they gave_me a delivery time between one hour - the next_day !
2	the driver who was identified in advance as ' brian ' turned_up the first minute of that hour !
2	solid but evil on pricing
2	so so overrated :-)
2	strings_direct are good for mainstream stuff - i need bespoke and these_guys can '_t be doing with the faff .
2	oh well
2	great delivery and all that and good communication , but having looked at what we got - in the flesh - for the money we paid (!)
2	- a ' designer chiminea ' i would say its a rip_off basically .
2	we paid £_000 for something really worth £_00 in my obviously subjective estimation ): trading on the idea that its cheaper on line i suppose ; don_'_t be_fooled .
2	go to a shop .
2	read a few reviews about gak which weren_'_t great .
2	no need to worry .
2	comms were great , items arrived speedily .
2	buy from these_people with confidence .
2	well_done gak !
2	if i need any thing for my porsche , this is my first point of call .
2	i know i will get good advice and the parts will be with me asap .
2	thank_you .
2	when you are a small business needing to send out various parcels then i would really recommend parcels0go ..
2	i have always found the website easy to use and the choice of carriers ' under one roof ' really helpful .
2	a when you get a problem there is a ' live helper ' link not too far away ....
2	i telephoned national showers explaining a problem with a grohe built in toilet system . the person i spoke to advised me what the problem could be and how to fit the necessary replacement parts .
2	the parts arrived the next_day and i was able to fit them following the advise i had been given .
2	have just received hp_printer from pixmania . their price was the most competitive available being 00_% less expensive than the major_retailer i was considering_purchasing from .. it was ordered on december 00th on a 0 - 0 day delivery . this was met and the goods arrived in good condition . i would have no_reservations in making future_purchases from pixmania .
2	i ordered a gretsch case .
2	it arrived in 0 days and the delivery guy was great .
2	the case was quite expensive but i expected that before i looked for a supplier .
2	nevada were one of the few who had them in stock .
2	i would use them again .
2	ordered msm 0000mg , web_site very easy to use and delivery extremeley fast . would definiteley use nature `_s best again
2	i ordered my sony sve00 laptop on tuesday_morning , selecting next_day delivery . as soon as i had placed my order i received a detailed invoice and delivery details . on the wednesday i was able to track where my parcels were at any given time . they arrived within the estimated time slots , well_packaged and protected . i have since ordered an extended_warranty and even that has arrived by courier , and yes i was able to track that too . i would have no_hesitation in buying from save on laptops again or recommending them to anyone .
2	i am thoroughly satisfied with the service - even when there was a slight_hiccup with my order i received a personal email keeping_me informed of the progress and the whole order was completed 0 days_later
2	kept me in touch with what was happening all the way and after my shoes were just a half size too small , the service to get bigger ones was excellent .
2	having spent some time on the web reviewing my pension options and wading_through the many providers claims i chose my pension_expert from a short list of three to whom i had actually spoken with .
2	from my intial conversations with ashley , i was impressed .
2	they were polite , friendly and lived_up to their promise to repond quickly and keep me up to date throughout a process that was made longer by the pension changes in the spring 0000 budget .
2	jess did a fantastic job looking after me day to day as my funds were moved from one provider to another and then back again to take_advantage of the changes .
2	scott '_s advice on new options in the light of the changes was most welcome and allowed_me to increase my annual income by 00 %.
2	thanks again to you all .
2	i would happily_recommend my pension_expert .
2	have you seen the cost of cr0 batteries in shops ?
2	i just needed 0 to run my pepper mill and could not believe the cost so i did my research on the internet .
2	i found buyabattery and they came out top on cost and then on service .
2	the website was easy to use and i was so amazed when the batteries arrived the next_day and at a third of the price ....!
2	i will defintely be back when the salt grinder expires !
2	thanks again buyabattery
2	small lens_hood needed in a hurry .
2	could be obtained cheaper of course - everything can be obtained cheaper if your life means so little that you have an_hour or two to waste trolling the web .
2	ordered from sg mid_afternoon - arrived through my letterbox next_morning .
2	that '_s service and seems to be standard from sg
2	odd how when i review a cd to cassette adaptor from halfords which not only does not work but wrecks my car stereo into the bargain - the one star_review is not published .
2	did i expect ethical behaviour ?
2	- strangely yes .
2	perfect lead for the job of powering a usb0 portable drive .
2	a parallel usb0 plug deals with power only while the usb0 data plug carries some power and all data - fast .

2	will fit round work give these_guys a try i did !

2	an incedible product , an excellent company
2	i did my travel_insurance through moneysupermarket on line because my woman had done hers with her bank and said " it '_ll be 0 days before it '_s here so you ' d better get yours done quickly before it '_s too late ! "
2	no problem .... after a minute or so i had all these quotes to compare and even access to the policy " small_print " to read so i knew_exactly_what was and wasn_'_t included and what i should or shouldn_'_t do ... if ... heaven_forbid .... i had the misfortune to have any mishaps during my travel period .!
2	i didn_'_t even go for the cheapest quote either ... i opted for alpha_travel ... it just appeared a better deal all_round for my needs !
2	very quick and very simple ... took minutes and then i got an email with a link to print off the policy itself ....... job_done and ... most_important ..... my woman '_s happy as well !
2	!

2	top only but it '_s fantastic .
2	headdress is a bit basic but it '_s a great fit ( my 0yo has a big head !).
2	the tomahawk needs more rounded_edges but i like to think my boy and his friends are sensible enough not to gouge holes in each other .
2	great service whenever i needed them , online , on phone or instore .
2	the items were despatched in days and i also got emails so i could check the tracking , if required .
2	the packaging was sturdy and , overall , everything is excellent .
2	i found 000 blinds on the internet , the website is amazingly navigatable .
2	everything you could_possibly need for your windows , is right there .
2	there is even a converter to assist with ordering your blinds or curtains .
2	i have bought both , and am extremely pleased with the products .
2	blinds are simple to fit with an outstanding quality plus unbeatable prices .
2	this is the one stop for all your curtains and blinds .
2	delivery is , as with all other aspects of this site , second to none .
2	there are no disappointments here !

2	emails_advising of the order '_s progress all the way ; advice on the hour in which the sunglasses would be delivered ; and then they were delivered during that hour , on the correct day , no_fuss , exactly as promised .
2	many_thanks .
2	i needed a silver waistcoat for a wedding_invitation in italy and made several trips to shops in bristol , bath and various shopping centres but to no_avail .
2	i was hesitant to purchase on line for a waistcoat as i was unsure of the material quality and colour ( silver or grey ) so i asked for a material sample from my tuxedo .
2	the sample was excellent and the waistcoat , tie and handkerchief arrived promptly and were also first_rate .
2	the waistcoat fitted_perfectly .
2	we have had a series of wooden signs for our house and holiday_cottage .
2	all looked good initially but within a year or two the paint fades & chips , the wood warped and rotted .
2	these atlantic_signs look as good as the day we installed them and many of our guests often comment on them .
2	well_done .
2	jtx are a very proffesional company .
2	first_class service .
2	very pleased with the treadmill .
2	i have only one complaint .
2	the courier service they use , tnt .
2	are useless .
2	they refused to deliver the item because it was too heavy .
2	i took two_days off work to take delivery , but they never showed up .
2	in the end it was deliver by two men who were very helpful and polite .
2	if you order i would opt for the 0 man delivery service .
2	do not use tnt .
2	very poor .
2	the site stated that they had several of the drives ( albeit twice the price of other_sites ) i was looking for in stock .
2	i duly phoned to confirm and placed the order over the phone then .
2	i balked a little at the £ 0 +_vat but was told that was because it was next_day delivery , so reluctantly i sucked it up .
2	the following_day i chased the order by phone as it hadn_'_t turned_up by 0 :_00pm only to be put through to customer_services and to be told that they hadn_'_t got stock .
2	obviously they don_'_t hold stock , they simply try to get their suppliers ' to drop ship .
2	they said that i should have received an email_stating this , which i hadn_'_t .
2	i canceled the order .
2	very disappointed .

2	thank_you .

2	i tried a well_known kitchen maker to try and buy doors , gave them the sizes but they couldn_'_t do the job , so got on the internet and came_across kitchen_door workshop it was easy to order and i think very good prices the order was very quick and the doors first_class everything was drilled and easy to fit . the only problem was the price of delivery £_00 because we stay in the highland not the back of beyond but 00 miles from inverness . would have no problem recommending this company to any of my friends .
2	have booked our last 00 holidays with expedia its so easy no_hassle . just do it online or the phone , tried other_companies but they don_'_t come close on price or service would not go_anywhere_else .
2	been to vegas the last 0 years and just booked to go to florida next june can '_t say more than that believe me i don_'_t please easy but have no_hesitation in using this company every time if the standard falls whould have no problem telling them but until that day will always book expedia 00 out of 00 .

2	i live in malaysia and needed my order to be shipped to my friends in the uk who are coming out to visit .
2	placing the order was very easy and i was able to pay via my local paypal_account and request shipment to the uk at the same time as i checked out , so it couldn_'_t be simpler .
2	delivery was by 0st_class post which was very reasonable and my order was received the following_day .
2	many_thanks and well_done viovet ,

2	i decided to migrate from npower to another supplier in december_0000 and 0 months later they still have not been able to resolve and issue the credit refund whch i am owed .
2	was on their dual_fuel scheme and back in january received a final gas bill showing over £_000 in credit , 0 days_later a ` for information only ` statement showing £_000 . 00 .
2	contacted them and told allow 00 days for refund .
2	no final electric bill arrived nor refund so contacted them again .
2	told it would be sorted within 00 days which it wasnt so completed their online complaints form which , other than their auto response ` email was completely_ignored .
2	loads more phone_calls to them and i finally thought i was getting somewhere on 0th_may after spending 0h 00_mins going through everything again .
2	supposedly she had found , sorted the problem , finalised my account and authorized the refund and informed me this would be in my account within 0 - 0 working_days .
2	needless to say the refund has not appeared up to today ..
2	do not believe a word this company says .
2	in my opinion their whole_operation should be fully investigated by the energy_ombudsman .
2	you are always unsure what standard of service you will receive when dealing_with a online company for the first time .
2	shopping with pharmacyfix . co . uk was so easy and their system kept me updated as to my order status .
2	goods arrived even before their estimated delivery date .
2	overall i would give them 00 / 00 .
2	placed order with free delivery which arrived 0 days_later , as_described , well_packed and working .
2	what more do you want .
2	it was a good ' one stop_shop ' for me to buy a memory card , a case and a lens cap .
2	i bought a lamp from dooleys on an internet purchase .
2	was pleasantly_suprised when they called me prior to delivery , so many companies just leave you waiting without so much as a second thought .
2	not so here .
2	nice smooth_transaction and a pleasure to deal with .
2	have used four or five times now , all for prescription_meds .
2	very easy to upload presriptions , very competitive_prices and very fast delivery .
2	no_complaints !
2	no question is too small to be answered , prices are the lowest on the net and delivery times are unbelievable - if you want golf_equipment check these out first .
2	excellent efficient service throughout - thank_you
2	i noted the product i ordered was incorrect however nothing was too much_trouble for them to change it over the phone without_any complaints or disparaging remarks .
2	the service was first_class and would definately_use again .
2	we have 0 cats and buy hills dry_food for them .
2	we used to use the large pet shop chains but noticed that if there was not an offer on , the price was very high .
2	however , medicanimal '_s prices are always at the lowest discount levels in store and if you buy in bulk you can get further discounts .
2	service is good too ( 0 / 0 working_days max ).
2	the other thing we like is no_hidden_charges ( delivery etc )
2	very good service .
2	no pressure involved and john garcia took the time to run through each policy quoted and highlighted the areas that made certain policies suit my requirements over others .
2	the website was easy to navigate and gave_me plenty of options to choose from .
2	booked this at 00 . 00 and courier never showed up .
2	interparcel told me to wait_till 0 , then told me they could do nothing so i should contact tnt .
2	tnt then said they were never sent the booking .
2	the guys at interparcel refused to try and help , refused to upgrade telling_me that actually " it is a non - guaranteed service ".
2	i was told that they would rebook it for the next_day but were not prepared to do anything to placate me or to try and retain me as a customer .
2	also they would not confirm that the same thing would not happen the next_day .
2	i would advise anyone who was thinking of using them to not .
2	stay as far away as possible .
2	cowboys with no customer service care at all .
2	i ordered a set of winter_tyres late on monday and they were in my garage before breakfast on thursday .
2	delivery was free ( special_offer ) and i could track the shipment every_step of the way .
2	mid - delivery i made a late in the day e_mail query to tyremen and was answered by return .
2	best of all the price was extremely attractive .
2	this is exactly how we all hope to buy on the internet but it rarely happens .
2	top_marks to tyremen .
2	i '_ve just spent most of the day researching ; comparing & then buying my first satellite_navigation system .
2	the best place i found after_trawling the internet was , you guessed it argos !
2	the buying guide on their website was very , very informative & i was able to compare all their sat_nav systems which really helped_me decide what system i should buy .
2	after doing price comparisons on the internet i decided to , yes you '_ve guessed it buy from argos .
2	i jumped back on the argos website selected a binatone f000 0 . 0 inch uk and roi sat_nav (£_00 . 00 ) & a hama sat_nav universal accessory_kit (£_00 . 00 as a package deal ).
2	clicked on reserve & was given a reservation number .
2	drove into_town , paid & collected my order in less_than 0 minutes ( service in shop excellent ).
2	i could have had it delivered , but i wanted it now !
2	really , really excellent throughout the whole_transaction .
2	and !
2	the sat_nav & accessory_kit ( total price £_00 . 00 ) are , in my opinion , the most awesome pieces of kit i '_ve ever_seen !
2	god_knows what the £_000 + kits do .
2	they must make you a cup of coffee & a bacon butty during the journey for that price ????
2	anyway - argos 00 out of 00 - binatone sat_nav 00 out of 00 .
2	visiting my daughter tomorrow ( me & the sat_nav ) down in hampshire .
2	hours of fun - fun - fun !!!
2	for a wrinkly old man .
2	picking_up a roof_rack purchased on ebay monday near wigan .
2	more hours of fun ?
2	i should mention the collection was from the loughborough branch of argos .
2	staff : polite ; efficient & friendly .
2	my till receipt said 0 minute wait , i waited 0 minute and was on my way in 0 .
2	i '_ve only been using healthspan for a couple of months .
2	first order in november_0000 .
2	the tablets i am taking have made such a difference ( multivitality 00 plus & co enzyme q00 ) the results of my recent annual diabetic review are amazing .
2	hba0c down to 0 . 0 % and cholesterol down to 0 . 0 , best ever results !
2	home monitoring glucose levels have dropped significantly and i '_m feeling brighter and more positive / energetic .
2	i also take omega 0 tablets which , i shall be ordering from healthspan , when my current supply runs out .
2	my ex mother - in - law has used healthspan products for years and she is 00 years old .
2	i should have listened to her recommendation '_s years_ago but you know what men are like !
2	apart_from the products on the website there are some excellent articles and reviews of the products which help to steer you to the correct tablets for your needs .
2	if the prices and service stay the same i '_ll be using them for years .
2	many_thanks healthspan .
2	the people reading this site must be getting fed - up of my reviews .
2	but i believe that bad companies & organisations should be put under the spot light and encouraged to provide decent customer service .
2	and good companies & organisations like agepartnership . com should be_applauded .
2	i have just used this company to find an open_market option ( omo ) for my annuity savings .
2	as i , now , know trying to find the best options in the market is a minefield .
2	i hunted_around the internet for quotes from comparison_sites and was contacted by numerous companies .
2	at that time i had not found trustpilot , so had no yard - stick to judge the best company .
2	because the choice of an annuity_provider was a very big decision i put in a lot of time and effort researching the options of annuity providers & financial_advisers that will assist in the search .
2	i had already gone the route of finding two independent_financial_advisers ( ifa '_s ), which is a nightmare in it '_s self , because unless your pension_pot is very large ( which mine wasn_'_t ) the costs can be astronomical .
2	of the four companies who contacted me it soon became_apparent that agepartnership was the best option .
2	although i knew a fair bit about the annuity options_available to me , their financial_adviser , james wadsworth walked me through it step by step on the telephone taking all the details and providing documentation promptly through the post as well as email contact and back - up .
2	the bottom_line is that i was provided with the most friendly & professional service you can_imagine , at no cost to me ( the regulations on this type of service have recently changed ) and the amount of my annual pension was increased quite considerably .
2	many_thanks to all at agepartnership
2	update_: just read all the reviews on the site .
2	i really am surprised they got a couple of duff one '_s and that they are only second on the pensions list .
2	but it just goes to show different peoples perspectives .
2	i '_ve been a smoker all my life from the age of 00 ( i know it '_s not politically correct !)
2	and a bit of an outdoors type , camping / hill walking / survival training / rock_climbing etc .
2	i have probably purchased or been given ( as presents ) about 0 or 0 zippo windproof lighters but never used their life time guarantee before .
2	i just got another one instead .
2	my last one , that was given to me as a present was in 0000 , by a very special person .
2	it '_s took some hammer , been engraved by me with a vibro - pen , got my initials some graffiti & my telephone_number on and looks_like s *** outside , battered & scratched .
2	it finally gave up the ghost in about 0000 when the hinge on the lid was hanging off & wouldn_'_t close properly .
2	so i put it in it '_s presentation_box and thought i '_ll fix it tomorrow !
2	tomorrow came in 0000 , when now i '_ve retired , i thought i '_ll send it off and get it fixed under the life time guarantee .
2	0 or 0_weeks_later as per the time line on the website .
2	it '_s back - shinning brand_new inner , excellent repair to the hinge and spring ( the lid clicks just like a zippo should ) and best of all , outside its battered & scratched and rough looking as though it '_s took some hammer .
2	just like it '_s very , very pleased owner .
2	thank_you zippo - " it lights first time every time " like a zippo should and like a sherman did many_years_ago - when some very brave men used both !
2	i '_ve already exhausted myself adding comments to the other reviews .
2	please see them to get a real flavor of how i feel about this absolutely_appalling company and its derivatives .
2	i '_ve only found 0 but there are probably more out there ?
2	they should all be put out of business asap due to their total_lack of honesty and integrity .
2	they are selling brackets for £_00 /£ 00 /£ 00 & £_000 then sending brackets that are priced at £_00 on their website .
2	in my opinion they have purchased a consignment of brackets , a00blk which they are unable to sell due to the inherent design faults of only having 0 hole wall - fixings , vertically spaced , with a narrow seating_area .
2	anyone with any technical_knowledge would recognize that over time the forces acting on the cantilever arms will loosen the fixings and cause the tv to plummet to the floor .
2	would you trust your £_000 - £_000 - £_000 tv to this set - up - no you wouldn_'_t .
2	don_'_t get me wrong the bracket ( a00blk ) that was incorrectly delivered to me is a good sturdy piece of engineering , which looks good and functions as it should .
2	but with the design fault mentioned i would not / will not mount my tv ( 00kg ) on it , without modifications .
2	which i don_'_t intend mentioning here , as i would sooner see the companies fail ?
2	with some effort on my part i will make the bracket work but most people do not have the time , energy and expertise necessary to do this .
2	so the companies concerned : 000rackets . co . uk ; racketsrus . co . uk & tvrackets0u . co . uk will_continue to scam the uk public with their underhanded ; shoddy ; un - principled ways .
2	unless stopped by you joe_public !
2	review update 00 / 00 /_0000
2	email today offering me a different bracket - they must have seen my original review .
2	if i accept their offer it will cost me £ 0 to send the bracket back .
2	what do you think the chances of getting the new bracket are ( marks from 0 - 00 ) and what are the chances of getting a refund when i '_ve sent it back ( marks again 0 - 00 ).
2	i will mark it 0 - 0 .
2	because i think i will then be £_00 . 00 out of pocket with nothing to mount my tv on .
2	when trust has_gone - its gone
2	would you trust them ?
2	comments please .
2	review update 00 / 00 /_0000
2	another email today from 000rackets , they will pay for me to return the bracket and send me another one or give me a refund .
2	readers i wonder_why ?
2	has your trust score gone up yet !
2	mine '_s not still ( 0 - 0 ).
2	just sent the initial story of to watchdog on their website ( what a bind ).
2	i '_ve run out of steam tonight so i '_ll leave doing rip of britain ( the 0 fair ladies ) until tomorrow or maybe a weekend job .
2	did you know that jennie bond is 00 , angela rippon is 00 and gloria hunniford is 00 .
2	i perhaps shouldn_'_t mention their ages but i was absolutely amazed when i read the article about them .
2	they have still defiantly got it all - charm , charisma & professionalism .
2	makes me look and feel about 000 and i '_m only 00 honest .
2	kept me up to date with my order and gave_me plenty of notice for a 0 hour_slot for delivery .
2	having_researched several sites i found this one to be best when including_postage .
2	the bags are strong and worth the extra_cost compared to cheaper weaker versions .
2	first used car_hire 0000 from sept 0 - sept 00 .
2	the car was collected from " record go " at alicante .
2	although the car had dents and scratches it drove really well ( kia picanto ).
2	the second time i rented from aug 00 - sept 0 . the agent this time was " goldcar " ( also alicante ).
2	this time i collected a skoda_fabia .
2	this was almost brand_new .
2	on both_occasions the service given was both helpful and efficient .
2	my only_gripe was that the second hire , 0 days , was just one day longer_than " pay for the fuel you use " policy so i had to pay for a full_tank .
2	definitely purchase again .... not only was it a great price , but the service was excellent .
2	thanks .
2	you read_reviews of companies on the web and can sometimes be put off buying , so it '_s a chance you take ...... with beyond_television we took a chance on the samsung d0000 as the price was far cheaper_than anywhere .
2	the communication was excellent , the tv arrived on the day promised and was delivered by an extremely_helpful delivery driver ... their own courier .
2	can not fault them .... fantastic service !
2	i have nothing but excellent praise to give to the team at buyaparcel . com .
2	...
2	they are the only company i have come_across on the internet that not only understand the v . a . t .
2	relief for disabled products ( i purchased a saniplus macerator for the bathroom ) but actually highlight it on their web_page and then give you help over the phone to complete the forms required .
2	i placed the order at 00 . 00 and it arrived by 00 . 00 the next_morning .
2	great price , great communication , great service .... you can '_t ask for any more than that .
2	i '_ll recommend to friends and definitely buy again .
2	thanks
2	i have used wheelspin_models a lot in the past and they are normally very good but i have not received my last order .
2	i '_ve bought 0 or 0 cameras and several lenses and other accessories now from digitalrev and they have never disappointed .
2	being unable to book a hire car for our last_minute holiday to menorca at a reasonable price - £_000 for a weeks hire is completely_unacceptable when they advertise car_hire from £_00 per day , we were faced with an £_00 each way taxi_fare when we found resorthoppa offering return airport_transfers for £_00 for the three of us .
2	we decided to risk it and made our booking at 0 . 00pm the night before we flew out at 0 . 00 am the next_day .
2	this was less_than 00_hours before we would arrive in menorca but we received an email confirmation by return with all the correct details on it .
2	and giving very clear_instructions on what to do on our arrival at menorca airport .
2	the ladies running the office were very good and our coach was ready and waiting for us .
2	we set off right on time and we were delivered right to our door for the fraction of the price of an airport taxi .
2	the return trip also went off without a hitch and i would recommend this company to anyone on the basis of the service we received .
2	it offered excellent value for money and took out all the hassle you can get with car_hire_companies .
2	paul & tanya hogan .
2	an excellent e_- trader with competitive_prices and excellent service and follow - up on orders .
2	excellent web - shopping .
2	a fully - stocked outdore store with great prices that delivers what you want , when you want .
2	very impressive service , would highly_recommend .
2	the solwise powerline_adapter i purchased from broadband_buyer failed after several months and i was advised by solwise to return it to the company i purchased it from .
2	having submitted an rma request to broadband_buyer over a weekend i received the rma on the monday , returned the faulty item on the tuesday and had the replacement back by friday .
2	needless to say i was impressed !
2	love the company always quick deliveries
2	lovely painting and fantastic value for money
2	i will be ordering more products from lightinthebox in the near_future .
2	0st_class service & quality
2	i ordered 0 roof_box keys & within_00hrs they arrived through my letterbox , you cannot get any better_than that .
2	would deal with them again thats for sure .
2	easy to contact very polite everthing explained thoroughly and great value for money i will_certainly be using travel_republic in the future for other destinations to visit , i looked at other_companies online but these came nowhere_near travel_republic for value & their website is so much_better & simple to navigate searches for flights & hotels .
2	overall well pleased
2	first time i '_ve_used this company - it was the cheapest on the web for husked sunflower seed i was after .
2	delivery was exceptionally quick .
2	next_day if i recall_correctly .
2	quality was mixed - i order 0 separate bags of the largest_size .
2	the first was very dusty ( more than i would normally expect ) but the sunflower_seeds it contained were fine and , ultimately healthy and usable .
2	the second was the same quality as i would expect from any other bird_food supplier - that is with little dust and healthy sunflower_seeds .
2	not sure if the dusty one was just that - a one off - but would consider_using again to test .
2	after using the mazuma website the freepost_envelopes arrived the next_day .
2	we sent off our phones , they were even insured free of charge .
2	within a few_days we recieved the cheques from mazuma .
2	this is a fantastic way of selling your old_phones .
2	fancied some road tyres for my mountain blike , googled it , came up with cyclestuffdirect .
2	browsed the site , got some advice via_email about tyre size , innertubes etc , then placed my order for 0 tyres and a new helmet at a very reasonable price .
2	next_day , bloke knocks on the door with 0 parcels , to be honest i couldn_'_t believe_how rapid the delivery was .
2	very happy with products and the service , cant_fault it ......
2	it was easy to find the products i wanted , easy to shop for them on the website , nice to have no postage_charges for a change , and they arrived in a couple of days .
2	shampoo was excellent and the free_gift useful too .
2	easy to find what i wanted , website easy to use .
2	items arrived soon after - only_downside was extreme packaging ( more than needed ?
2	).
2	getlenses . co . uk have been around a few_years_now , and deliver contact_lenses and solutions at competitive_prices .
2	i used to take my elderly_parents to do their shopping at sainsbury '_s and have carried on using for my weekly_shop .
2	i like the range of products , and also the various price ranges e . g .
2	the basicsd through to ' taste the difference '.
2	i '_ve_used the online service occasionally but prefer to shop instore .
2	i find the staff are helpful and the queues aren_'_t generally too long .
2	i have never had any problem with battery_force - as well as a massive_range of products , friendly advice is available and their prices are very competitive .
2	one of the best things is that postage & packing charges are sensible - not just '£ 0 . 00 per order ' like many companies .
2	selections have some unusual bargains for me and their service is excellent .
2	very good service .
2	as usual the best service on the net ..... 0nd to none
2	liverpool went down well with our stag week end from york .
2	apartment very well equipment we even used the ironing_board for our shirts for the saturday_night out , the location very central for all the night life .
2	clay_pigeon shooting well_organised and very professional in its presentation .

2	superb !
2	!
2	the goods turned_up quickly as promised & were well_packaged .
2	i will_definately_use them again when the need_arises .
2	:-)
2	the website was intuitive to find your way around & although my order was placed late on sunday_night , it was with me early tuesday .
2	the tektro brake_pads just fitted in without trouble & i was back on the trail by lunchtime !
2	:-) smiles all_round .
2	i will_definately_use this company again without a second thought .
2	after getting to the checkout on a competitors website ( also a great indian dish ) 0 times only to be told the washing_machine i had chosen was either out of stock or would take 0 to 0_weeks delivery my wife suggested using appliancesonline .
2	the choice of washing_machines was amazing , and the lg one caught my wifes eye .
2	the site had a video which help us decide it was the right one , even_though it was more than the one we originally chose .
2	so we placed the order , the very next_day a very friendly chap_called to confirm all of the delivery details and that we were all set for a saturday delivery at no extra_cost !
2	the logistics company rang the day before delivery to let us know a rough time window and delivery was bang on time the next_day .
2	our brand_new very shiny washing_machine was up and running before 0 . 00am on saturday and we are extremely pleased with our purchase overall 00 / 00 0_star service , would recommend to everyone .
2	superb models , not toys !
2	excellent turnaround on service and delivery times brilliant .
2	had some issues with the payment side of the site as it wouldnt verify with my bank ( checked with bank and verification never even got to them ) so switched to paypal and now have no_problems .
2	wish there were fewer plastic parts on my model as i am upgrading to aluminium or carbon as each one breaks .
2	love the car though :)
2	order number_000000000 .
2	looked for boot ice grippers .
2	found perfect solution , good price , ordered , rapid delivery ( beat the thaw anyway !)
2	and the product does_exactly_what it says on the web_site .
2	very happy .
2	what '_s not to like ?
2	we have been using james_villas for many_years .
2	we have had villas in portugal and spain and then we had one in cyprus , fell in love with the island and are now on our seventh visit back to cyprus , every time with james_villas .
2	the properties are always beautiful , very well_maintained and set in ideal locations within their own lovely grounds that keep your privacy .
2	on one occasion the kettle stopped_working , a replacement appeared within 00_minutes .
2	what brilliant service .
2	from_start to finish and beyond the service standards are no . 0 and cannot be criticised .
2	we thank james_villas , the web staff , the staff at the head_office and the reps at the resorts for making each and every stay over almost ten_years extremely enjoyable !
2	we will_continue to give 000_% recommendations to everyone .
2	the ordering was easy , the service was second to none and the delivery was quick .
2	highly_recommended .
2	i highly_recommend the service and will shop again .
2	number one for great service , thank_you .
2	i ordered on tuesday_night and had my package on thursday_morning and was able to track it online all the way ( from_hong_kong !
2	).
2	exceedingly well_wrapped too , to minimise any damage .
2	seriously , i '_m impressed .
2	was let_down by another online matresses company .
2	these_guys were superb .
2	next_day delivery .
2	driver called us .
2	just faultless .
2	use ' em !
2	this site gave the best price for a canon 000m lens ( without going down the import route ).
2	i '_ll be honest - my first attempt at ordering didn_'_t go smoothly - for some reason the site would not accept my card and i couldn_'_t get a clear answer ( when i phoned ) as to why .
2	i suspect there was a problem with the sellers payment system but they blamed the bank .
2	the bank just acted puzzled ( as they do !)
2	and i was told to wait a week ( by both_parties ) " in case the payment went through ".
2	frustrating , as i wanted to take the lens on holiday .
2	o . k - that was the downside .
2	i waited a week , went back online , reordered and promptly received an email_confirming payment .
2	the next_day i received another email_saying that my order had been upgraded to next_day delivery .
2	" that '_s nice ", i thought .
2	better still it arrived that afternoon !
2	first_class service and a very good price .
2	i thought of knocking a star off because of the first encounter but quite honestly i can '_t be certain who '_s fault that was .
2	very efficient service with useful updates by both email and sms .
2	an excellent service .
2	thoroughly_recommended .
2	happy to recommend this services for the benefit of others .
2	price agreed online .
2	despatch envelope sent promptly .
2	recommend send the items by recorded delivery .
2	payment received the same day .
2	that '_s what mazuma says .
2	that '_s what they do .
2	excellent service !
2	as always ordered on day 0 delivered on day three even considering the bank_holiday_weekend
2	ordered on sunday delivered on tuesday .
2	super service , quick delivery and great value prices
2	easy shopping with great selection and prices
2	this company were bang on .
2	tried their very best to help us and promptly replied when we issued our ' complaint '.
2	so although we had a problem i could not fault the company or the service offered .
2	very good !
2	thank - you !
2	excellent service & quality product , would definitely use again & highly_recommended .
2	quality product , good value & very quick delivery - perfect !
2	well_done again as with your other customers i must_say what an excellent service and products you sell .
2	many_thanks and i would also use you again .
2	my most_recent_purchase is a refurbished_dell_laptop and docking_station .
2	a problem with the charger was sorted quickly .
2	the laptop is in excellent condition and is ideal for work .
2	i have used crs in the past for desktop_pc '_s and ipads .
2	i would happily_recommend them for future_purchases .
2	got 0 new tyres_fitted and balanced for just over 000_quid .
2	part worn ones would have cost £_00 thats a no_brainer to me .
2	ordered tuesday_afternoon received goods wednesday_morning , you cant get better_than that .
2	purchased several copters and various spares and the prices are competitive with similar companies .
2	just purchased the new blade 000 cfx and they were a good £_00 cheaper_than anywhere_else in the uk and they also upgraded my delivery free of charge via fed x .
2	recommended and will_continue to purchase from them if they have what i need .
2	kind_regards ,
2	pete mann
2	used this company on several_occasions and they have always given a top rate service .
2	picked us up on time at the airport , 00 seater minibus for 0 of us so there was plenty of room , arrived early for return transfer with a minibus , both drivers were very courteous , the price was extremely reasonable , i will not_hesitate to use again and to recommend suntransfers .
2	very happy with service .
2	although the item ( basketball package ) was received damaged the company did everything they could to rectify the problem .
2	would definately recommend and use again .
2	i was having problems getting what i was looking for , i found your sight with exactly_what i required at a very reasonable cost and ordered it .
2	the order process was very easy and delivery prompt and efficient .
2	very good company to deal with , happy to recommend
2	i was looking to purchase a small pa_system for private / small party groups which would work easily through my laptop .
2	i found this system on the web and decided that it should be exactly the product that i was looking for , two speakers and amplifier at a reasonable cost .
2	i won the item at what i thought was a very reasonable cost and decided to go_ahead with purchase , this was carried through very efficiently and i received the goods which were exactly as i had expected , delivery was prompt and efficient withe the product very well_packaged and protected i found it very easy to set_up and works very well , i have no_hesitation in recommending this company as reliable and trustworthy
2	i recently ordered some hose connectors which were found to be out of stock .
2	keen_gardener mailed me to explain that there could be a delay of up to 0_weeks on the order .
2	this was valuable_information as the delay would affect my project .
2	the company offered that i could cancel the order which i did , and i sourced the items elsewhere .
2	this was very impressive customer service in my opinion .
2	i would therefore strongly_recommend keen_gardener as an honest trading company .
2	okobe have produced a very clear and user_friendly website experience .
2	combined with very competitive_pricing , i '_m not surprised they are highly_rated .
2	an excellent model for on - line trading .
2	i ordered a benq digital projector and laptop bag , and received the parcels within 0 working_days , even_though i had paid normal p_&_p .
2	items were well - packaged and unopened .
2	they worked first time .
2	simple , clear e_- mails notified me all through the process .
2	well_done , i shall use okobe again .
2	i just hope that their carrier can match this first_class service .
2	they identified the key i needed from a photo of the lock that i e_- mailed to them and sent me a key within 00_hours .
2	an excellent service at a reasonable price .
2	highly_recommended .
2	would definitely recommend using this service , had no_problems with product or service .
2	will be using again
2	not even the decency to communicate properly with customers !!
2	!
2	i purchased an iten from this company and ( not having used it ) wanted a refund .
2	lambda - tek would not accept the return and refused to communicate meaningfully , they would not answer even simple questions .
2	clearly the company prefers not to take returns and makes doing so very difficult .
2	their packaging for original shipment was not up to the standard that they demand from customers who wish to retun an item , a poor approach with such delicate high - value products .
2	not a company i feel i can trust .
2	.
2	arrived earlier_than stated - i was very pleased with the service
2	would definitely recommend !!
2	!
2	the delivery was prompt , the packaging adequate and the service was exemplary .
2	i am sure to go back there .
2	my first time using parts_gateway has not been good . the main_reason was the part i was supplied with was fauly / heavy corrosion and with the incorrect abs lead fitted ( obvious not for my car , i confirmed this with renault who did not recognise part number of abs lead fitted ). i called the supplier rp services who were not very helpfull and said if i return item ( extra_cost of postage ) they would inspect and if found faulty they might return money . as part was needed i sought alternative supply and decide to cut my loss .
2	there was nothing wrong with the service or the flowers i ordered .
2	i got a text at 00 :_00am saying " your flowers have left the building ."
2	cute .
2	nice_touch .
2	thank_you very much .
2	they arrived at around 0pm .
2	by that point i was starting to think they hadn_'_t just left the building but they ' d gone to las_vegas to take up residency at caesar '_s palace ( like elvis in 0000 , in case i '_ve lost you ).
2	they were delivered by yodel , and came in a box .
2	i don_'_t like flowers being delivered in boxes .
2	it '_s not right - they should be delivered by a florist ( not a courier ) and should be open to the light and the air .
2	all - in - all , not much to complain_about .
2	but i won_'_t be buying again .
2	i have ordered some after shave from this site , every time i called to ask where it has got to i got a different answer .
2	today i got an email reply to question as to where my item is .
2	i was told to read their terms and conditions and they accept no responsibility whatsoever for my delivery as i opted for standard deliver service which incidentally still cost £ 0 . 00 .
2	i googled them and this appears to be a common pattern , people order goods , nothing arrives , they then try and fob you off .
2	the last review before mine on this site i would hazard a guess they wrote it for themselves due to all the negatives .
2	good choice , competitive_prices , good previous experience , even from abroad .
2	now my 0st choice for on - line flower / plant or gift packs .
2	somehow i managed to book my ferry from france to uk , when it should have been the other way round .
2	luckily my wife spotted it and i rang aferry with fear in my heart , expecting to have to pay £_000 all over again !
2	the girl who dealt_with me set my mind at rest immediately .
2	she was very nice and made me feel much_better by saying it happened all the time .
2	anyway in two shakes of a lamb '_s tail she did it , and it only cost less that £_00 .
2	full_marks to aferry and its staff .
2	i ordered several items from this company - who are simply a web company that use local_plumbers ' merchants to supply the goods .
2	this is great .
2	i was very pleased with the service and particularly the prices .
2	i found a cheaper price on the web for one item and they matched it after i sent them the link .
2	i am very pleased with them and they are certainly cheaper_than going straight to the local shop - even with my trade discount .
2	love cash_generator .
2	item was as_described and the store pulled_out all the stops to get the item dispatched the same say i ordered it even_though it was after the cut_off time .
2	thanks
2	this is the first time that i have used animed , it was for frontline_flea / tick medication for dogs .
2	their price is the cheapest that i could_find , by about 00_%, and that was after lots of searching compared to the supplier i used before .
2	the frontline meds were delivered next business day , i presume first_class post is the norm , the price included delivery .
2	reassuringly the company makes you register your pet first because frontline is a restricted medication .
2	registering a pet is very easy .
2	i won_'_t hesitate to use animed again .
2	i bought a lg p000 which was locked to a different network service i found this site
2	so thought_id give it a try wow after putting in my details it took about 0 mins and i had my email with the unlock_code which worked my phone is unlocked and it was a very reasonable price nice one keep_up the good work id recommend to anyone
2	i had a look around specsavers for a pair of reading_glasses but couldn_'_t see anything i liked .
2	later i did a bit of web browsing on google and found glasses_direct , liked the range of choices and the price point .
2	i ordered the frames ( 0 for the price of 0 ) and sent of my prescription by email .
2	even better , i got 00_%_off the cost on a promotion too .
2	i have the glasses now and i am very pleased with them .
2	i would recommend glasses_direct to anyone .
2	i ordered a traktor x0 case from westenddj after trying many sites .
2	these often offered what looked like the best price and free delivery , but in reality the free delivery was only if you collected from a particular store or spent over £_000 .
2	with westenddj the price was competitive and the delivery cost fair .
2	i was impressed with the fast dispatch and the very informative delivery process .
2	i knew within the hour when the case would come .
2	i wouldn_'_t hesitate to use wetenddj again .
2	i ordered the memory_chips and two_days_later i had them .
2	very easy to navigate site and payment process was easy and obvious .
2	the only website i could_find the replacement part i needed .
2	the part was dispatched quickly and efficiently .
2	i will_definitely use them again .
2	an excellent collection of fragrances with something for almost every occasion .
2	the only_negative is that my favourite brand is not represented simply because the brand is never discounted !
2	still fragrancedirect offers some very attractive alternatives .
2	items were dispatched promptly , packaged well and arrived before the expected date .
2	what more can one ask ?
2	my trusted seiko_kinetic watch was beginning to lose time and was in need of repair .
2	after enquiring as to the cost charged by seiko for specialist repair , i quickly came to the conclusion that it would cost little more to buy a new watch , albeit not of quite the same value .
2	after doing internet research i found a design from the seiko_kinetic range that appealed and subsequently did a price check .
2	watches0st . co . uk was revealed as the best buy so i took the plunge .
2	the watch was delivered the next working day and in its original_packaging !
2	although the company offered a resizing of the bracelet i didn_'_t take up this option as it is often difficult to compare different styled bracelets .
2	i had this done at a local_jewellers at no charge .
2	the service form watches0st . co . uk was first_class and i would not_hesitate to recommend them to others looking to purchase a quality watch at a highly competitive price .
2	checked extensively on internet - could not beat this deal .
2	ordered wii lens cleaning_kit online , got an email to say it had been dispatched within an_hour , arrived next_day .
2	fantastic !
2	i ordered two xperia mini pro covers .
2	one fit fine , but the other did not .
2	after one e_- mail , a replacement was in the mail the next_day !!!
2	does not get any better_than this .
2	mb
2	we visited our local_store and ordered a fridge_freezer which we were assured would be in stock on 00 july and delivered the following week .
2	by 00 july we had received no word so my wife phoned customer_services .
2	it took many minutes for there to be any reply and eventually she spoke to a man who could_find no trace of our order . after some time he decided to transfer us to the branch .
2	they quickly found the order but said it would now be in store on 0 / 00 august .
2	the call lasted 00_minutes ( most of the time with customer_services ) .
2	on 0 august we received a call and it was arranged the delivery would take place on sunday august 00 .
2	the following_day we received a phone_call saying delivery would be between 0 and 0 and someone would ring 00_minutes before delivery sunday_afternoon arrived and along came a white_van which turned_out to be our delivery .
2	there had been no phone_call and the fridge_freezer was left in the middle of our storeroom complete with packaging despite our invoice stating that it would be unpacked and all packaging removed . we sent an email to curry '_s and their response was to tell us to phone customer_services and arrange for the packaging to be uplifted .
2	we emailed back stating we were not prepared to make another long phone_call and that they call us .
2	this they did and a day was arranged for the uplift .
2	we duly placed all the packaging on the pavement on the day requested but no uplift .
2	we eventually took the packaging 00 miles to a recycling centre .
2	a few_days_later we received a phone message_saying that they had called as arranged but could_find no trace of the packaging .
2	strange they did not see fit to knock on our door as we were at home all that day !
2	!
2	the irony is that another fridge_freezer was offered for delivery after this .
2	episode 0 we ordered a tablet online and received an email_saying it would be delivered on or before 00 september .
2	on 00 september we received a further email_stating " due to unforseen circumstances you may not receive the order within the stated_timescale ....".
2	; on 00 september we called into the local_branch who were unable to help us although they had the tablet in stock .
2	i asked if they would give me one from their stock but that was not possible .
2	they could sell me one but not at the internet price , i cancelled my order that same day but not until 00 september was a refund confirmed .
2	episode 0 - i bought an ipad on november 00 and received an email_confirming i could pick_up the item at the local_branch after an_hour .
2	this was in the evening so i called into the branch the next_day only to be told they had none in stock .
2	because of an error the one on display had been recorded as stock .
2	no alternative was offered so we left .
2	i was so disgruntled by this i sent an email to the ceo outlining these cases on 00 november .
2	i then sent him a reminder on the 00th .
2	i received a phone_call on 00 november from tom who assured me they were taking action to prevent these issues occurring again and it was unreasonable to expect the ceo of a multi_million_pound company to respond !
2	he offered me £_00 which he then raised to £_00 .. due to all the inconvenience and costs we incurred i declined his derisory offer .
2	all i want is an ipad which surely should not be too difficult for this " multi - million company " to provide !
2	the real irony is that a friend did warn us not to use curry '_s , i wish we had taken the advice !
2	!
2	my order arrived within_00hrs of being placed , speedy service and free delivery to boot !
2	!, excellent service .
2	i order for the first time from this company on the 0th_feb_0000 .
2	it clearly_states that the vast_majority of our customers orders reach them within 0 days but allow 00 days for delivery .
2	today 00 feb_0000 i rang this company to see why my order had not been delivered .
2	after a 00 minute delay of waiting for an operator .
2	i was cut_off .
2	then when i finally got through a guy said he was unable to deal with my issue and put me through to someone_else .
2	i was told because this product had been so popular there had been a delay and in fact the order had been dispatched today and would be with me in a week as it was coming from holland .
2	no email to advise of a delay .
2	goodbye healthspan you will not get another order from me .
2	i have used simplysupplements for a number of years_now and have never had a problem or cause for concern .
2	quality products from a quality company .
2	plain and simply .
2	if you want good friendly advise and value for money i would highly_recommend fitness - superstore .
2	i bought a nordic track cross_trainer , e0 zl as recommended by chris on the sales_team , it arrived on the correct day and was better_than described on the website .
2	i also ordered a floor mat and when i questioned if the one i chose was big enough i was given a free upgrade to a bigger mat .
2	first_class service , and a very good machine , as good as the one in the gym .
2	it took me 0 hrs to assemble and was not difficult .
2	shop with these_guys , you will not be dissapointed .
2	dont go_anywhere_else , this service is spot on
2	placed my order on line for a sebo x series upright x0 extra vacuum_cleaner on monday 00th_march at 00 : 00 and it was delivered next_day by dpd at 00 : 00 .
2	i was able to see on line the 0 hour delivery time_slot , so i didn_'_t have to wait in all day which was between 00 : 00 to 00 : 00 .
2	i purchased this vibration_plate after attending powerplate classes for the last 0 months .
2	i shopped_around and read the reviews so that i could get a good one this machine is fantastic .
2	it goes up to between 00 - 00hz ( vibrations per second ) ( which i haven_'_t used yet ) and is more than a match for the professional machines .
2	i am having the same work - out and results as i was at powerplate classes .
2	the delivery of this item was very fast ( it arrived within 00_hours of placing the order ) and it is pretty simple to put_together , it took me about 00_minutes .
2	it is a great , sturdy machine and i would thoroughly_recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a vibration_plate

2	received a call to sort it out and the lovely_lady helped_me through my selection , sending me a higher - priced model for the same i paid .
2	excellent !
2	uldis
2	have booked a couple of times with hostelbookers and not a problem .
2	what else can i say , the reviews help a lot and everything goes as planned .
2	perfect !
2	uldis
2	ordered some ram for my laptop , having no idea what it looked like , or the specifications .
2	just filled up the numbers asked for in the online form and got it ... perfect !
2	worked first time .
2	happy customer here :)
2	i '_m often asked to " fix " computers belonging to family or friends .
2	sometimes they are desktops without wifi .
2	the usb_adapter which has just arrived will be very welcome .
2	it is not very expensive ( useful as it will only get occasional use ).
2	ordering was no problem and delivery inexpensive and quick .
2	the soft opening bureau stays were delivered swiftly , were of good sturdy_construction and easy to fit with instructions included .
2	i bought tetrapond algofin because it was cheaper_than most places .
2	i chose standard delivery because i was in no hurry .
2	it arrived within five days and was packaged well .
2	i shall look here for other pond products in future ( saved in my favourites .)
2	an excellent service .
2	they said it would come the next_day and even pinpointed to the exact time .
2	good communicators and a company that keeps to its word .
2	highly_recommended .
2	ordered mountian equipment belay jacket for the afghan winter .
2	very keen price / all sizes and colours in stock and item arrived as promised .
2	hassle_free shopping !
2	!
2	using iflorist was so easy - great choice of flowers , easy to accessorize , choice of delivery options and most of all delivery on the day we wanted !
2	then to make things even easier - payment via_paypal was quick and friendly , nice job - the donovan family , san_francisco , ca , usa .
2	this company is great always use them for all my ink supplies
2	arrived in tenerife followed the instructions given .
2	no sign of taxi .
2	asked police , information and other_vendors in the airport but no joy .
2	spoke to the company providing the taxi on behalf of resorthoppa only to be told they stopped doing_business with resorthoppa 0 months_ago yet resorthoppa took money out of my account 0 days ago .
2	we were left high and dry and ended_up an_hour of messing_about having to sort our own transport out which funnily_enough was cheaper_than what resorthoppa was charging for the same service .
2	contacted resorthoppa who appeared to be blissfully unaware that the company they had alleged to have instructed to pick us up stopped doing_business with them 0 months_ago .
2	the woman at resorthoppa stated she would speak to the director however i am yet to hear_anything nor have i been refunded - yet .
2	be very wary about paying a company up front for these sorts of services especially when they rely_on a third_party .
2	i ordered product from easygates and the delivery was fine .
2	i have had the gate arms 00 months and have a major problem , in that the arm casing has broken ( 0yr warrantry ).
2	these arms were replacements for the same arms , ordered from easygates 0 ( ish_) years previously .
2	i have emailed them and they say that the arm has broken due to improper installation - when they were installed in the exact_same geometry as the ones that were there previously !
2	they have been very slow in responding to my email contact and are being less_than helpful in assisting me .
2	beware purchasing from them if you may need help after they have your money .
2	having received the response below , i am staggered !
2	i only entered a review on trustpilot , out of desperation at not having received a response from easygates , to my email .
2	i havd tried to call them several_times on saturday_morning ( as i have today at 0 . 00pm ) but simply get a constant unanswered ringing .
2	for them to reply to my review - yet still not respond to my email , is simply unbeleivable to me .
2	with regard to my having bough a spare - i purchased two complete swinging gate arms ( seperately ) which cost £_000 each - not what i would call a " spare_part ".
2	with regard to how the casing broke , i have suggested to them that there are a number of ways this could have happened - not least sub_standard metals used in the manufacture - or a fault in the manufacturing process - to which they have not replied .
2	as these two arms were fitted to the exact_same fitting points that the previous two arms were fitted ( they lasted for 0 - 0 years ) then one would assume if the fitting is incorrect , then the previous arms should have broken !!
2	!
2	i don_'_t realy want to have a public conversation - so can someone from easygates please call me as i have gates that don_'_t open !
2	!
2	!
2	highly satisfied with all_aspects of the age_partnership company , from_start to finnish , greartful of the help and freindliness i recieved .
2	first_class , couldn_'_t have done it without them , would highly_recommend this company .
2	000000
2	order as expected , delay of a few_days while item shipped from europe .
2	might try buying abroad next time .
2	ordered goods friday , arrived monday !
2	i wanted a vynal album from the 00 '_s and bingo , juno_records not only had it , but their pricing was excellent .
2	highly_recommend you check out their service
2	wow , we '_ve got such great photos from these_guys , both of our son at football and our daughter at dance competitions .
2	highly professional shots and hanging in pride of place in our hall ,
2	everyone comments on them .
2	we '_ve also ordered from the website , service is also first_class .
2	well_worth a visit online if you need anything in the holistic healing , or associated products .
2	love it love it , type in whatever even individual letter '_s or an assortment of letter '_s number '_s etc_etc and normally you will get onto some site , just love it and boy have i had fun with this one .
2	brilliant
2	have bought from this site and found the good '_s suitable for the older members of the family , nice stuff though , postage fast and return '_s are no problem .
2	have been a member for a few year '_s and have found the imput by other member '_s of this site really accurate and mostly up to date , well_done keep_up the good work tripadvisor
2	would use this company for most of my transactions and have found them to be the best so_far and very secure , no problem as to future usage .
2	i have made over half a dozen orders for various items in the past 0 months .
2	all my orders were just as_described with good prices and all arrived within_00hrs .
2	i will_certainly be making more orders .
2	efficient , timely and cost_effective .
2	excellent support and adminstration from_start to completion .
2	good service and range
2	on a recent business trip to glasgow i called into your store for some green_tea ... a knowledgeable and enthusiastic young_man helped_me , answering my questions on the different_types and putting me at ease .
2	there were 0 other salespeople in the store both of whom had a smile and a greeting for me .
2	i went in for £ 0 worth of tea , and came out having spent £_00 which included a superb wooden boxed set .
2	i was also made aware of the coffee and hot_chocolate too .
2	i ' d give it 00 out of 00 .
2	wanted an inexpensive dvd_player with freeview , and had trouble_finding anything suitable , thankfully 0wisemonkeys had the answer .
2	pruduct exactly as_described , arrived next_day , great value for money !
2	easy and hassle_free way to get your tank filled at the best price .
2	ordered some men '_s cycling_tights 0 pm arrived the following_day , just brilliant will be using cycle - clothing again .
2	well_done .
2	really quick transaction , ability to use paypal useful .
2	ultra quick shipment . great product at great price .
2	would recomend
2	what more can i add that already hasn_'_t been said about lenses for hire .
2	fantastic customer service , rapid delivery , great price & friendly , helpful , communications .
2	i will be using them again !
2	firstly let_me say the transaction was superb , my new dji000 naza lite quadcopter arrived quickly and they changed an incorrect item without_question .
2	i had read some very positive_reviews of the company but they were quite old and i can only_assume that now they ' re on the crest of the multirotor wave , they can '_t cope and the customer service has suffered .
2	i assembled the kit and , when i couldn_'_t get it running tried to get help .
2	they are very reluctant to talk to you on the phone and eventually harvey sent me an email with a sheet of settings .
2	he also said i should download naza assistant v0 . 00 .
2	this wasted a day because i later found that the model i bought won_'_t use this version .
2	i '_ve now managed to get most of the settings working myself and today tried to get a bit of final telephone help .
2	i was astounded at the offhand manner with which i was treated .
2	the lady on the phone said i shouldn_'_t really have bought a kit if i didn_'_t know what i was doing !
2	she also said that harvey was with a customer who was spending_thousands , so couldn_'_t be disturbed and that i should send an email .
2	he didn_'_t reply to the last one so i thought it was pointless .
2	the icing_on the cake was when john ( the director ) said that if it wasn_'_t working_properly then it was due to my lack of experience , because they ' d set_up hundreds of them and had no trouble .
2	basically , you get a sheet of settings and then you ' re on your own .
2	if it doesn_'_t work it '_s your fault .
2	the conclusion of this is that i am deeply dissatisfied with the treatment i have received , i can '_t remember when i have experienced such arrogance and poor customer service .
2	if you are starting on this exciting new hobby then i would strongly_advise going elsewhere if you are likely to need after sales advice .
2	i '_m an experienced electronic engineer , designing medical_equipment for the international space station , so it '_s not as if i '_m without relevant knowledge !
2	i '_ve_used viovet a couple of times now and have been absolutely_delighted with the service .
2	having two dogs means that i '_m at the mercy of extortionate prices from high_street vets but no_longer !
2	the first order was for flea_treatment which , unfortunately , means getting a prescription from my usual vet .
2	they charged me £ 0 for the privilege but even so , viovet '_s price was about half what i would have paid .
2	will_definitely be using them from now on .
2	it '_s easy no doubt when you know how , but i didn_'_t , and i was a little_apprehensive_about asking for help , but adi took the initiative and saved me the embarrassment of having to admit i had no clue to what i was doing , it all seemed daunting first time , but i was fortunate to have a 000 - reg man able to assist me , excellent .
2	stephen
2	i placed my order on friday and it arrived the next_morning - at a quarter of the price the vet_charges .
2	superb .
2	and the prescription by email service is just so civilised .
2	i would definately recommend this company as i placed an order with them on thursday the 0nd of january_0000 and recieved the goods on friday the 0rd of january_0000 .
2	fast service , would definately_use them again and recommend to my friends !.
2	thank_you mrs j .

2	fantastic service very quick delivery only took a little_longer due to good friday and bank_holiday
2	re booked insure and go travel_insurance recently , checked prices on comparison_sites and insure and go website .
2	prices apear cheaper on comparison_sites but level of protection advertised does not see to tally up with any schemes i found on the companies own web_site .
2	i have insured with them ( claim free ) for many_years_now and dissapointed that there is no form of recognition when you renew with them and no no claims discount_scheme available .
2	i needed to book an airline ticket for a friend , unable to book it on the airlines own web_site as they wanted too much info about my friend which i did not have and they did not need .

2	got great results viz fitted on time by very polite local_garage .
2	contact with black_circles was minimal but only because that '_s all that was needed ......
2	select , arrange fitting , pay - simples .

2	guitar arrived next_day as promised - a beautiful instrument - i am very pleased with it .
2	however it didn_'_t have a manufacturer '_s warranty card with it nor an owner '_s manual ( both mentioned in gibson '_s spec for the guitar )- but the company did say they would look into that for me and let_me know - but haven_'_t heard_anything back yet .
2	i '_ve bought from wheelspin a few_times now .
2	usually i '_m buying parts for my blade msrx which i keep breaking . they have always had the parts i '_m looking for in stock .
2	i '_ve found their delivery time is really good .
2	many_thanks wheelspin .
2	had bullguard of my machines for a number of years but v00 does take the award for operation in all areas along with the continued support that is faultless and effective , in my one bad_experience they had me back up a long time before my friends with the same problem had theirs .
2	would reccomend to everyone - first_class product and a first_class support_team , which is very rare_these days
2	just spoke to [_name_] at p0go as i made a mistake on the booking .

2	good service and fast delivery .
2	always fast delivery and good service in general .
2	been shopping there a couple of times and never had any_issues .
2	bought a number of machines from tier0 over the years .
2	always shipped rapidly and a good price .
2	if there are ever any_issues they sort it out rapidly .
2	no_hesitation in recommending them .
2	may not be the cheapest but not many beat them .
2	great gifts .
2	i '_ve been dealing_with amazon for some time now and every item i purchased has arrived in quick time and in perfect_condition .. the best in the business .. no 0 in my book for buying goods at a decent price , fast , reliable . and friendly service .
2	quick , reliable service and payment was within a few_days .
2	without_doubt the best ever . would recommend to everyone . in my book they are number 0 when it comes to paying you for your old_phones , i only wish they would add more electrical items that can be recyled . but still the best .
2	just received my mukumbura sun_glasses and am over the moon with them .
2	fit , style , tint , price , you name it everything was just dead right .
2	i will be ordering some clear glasses very very soon
2	just had a fab weekend at this friendly hotel , the staff were possibly the best i have come_accross from a budget hotel , nothing was too much_trouble !
2	food was great too , we had dinner and breakasts all served piping_hot and with quality ingredients , we would reccomend this hotel to anybody .
2	a good all_round service , no_problems at all .
2	i '_ve ordered tyres through blackcircles for more than 00 years and for a variety of our family '_s cars .
2	mostly , they '_ve been efficient and cheap .
2	but twice_now , i '_ve had damage to the wheels of my porsche .
2	once by a general garage in leeds and again recently by a mickey_mouse , country garage in somerset more noted for its restoration of old sunbeam cars than tyre_fitting .
2	and therein lies the problem .
2	when blackcircles uses experienced tyre_fitters they are very good , but unfortunately , the quality of workmanship can be very different with some of their less able fitting_partners .
2	you have been_warned
2	delivery was very fast , text_message for delivery was spot on , no weighting all morning , one hour delivery slot , if only all online stores could have service like this , very happy customer
2	this was the first time i have used viovet but it will_certainly not be the last .
2	obtained prescription for £_00 .
2	faxed copy to viovet with order number and product delivered 0 days_later .
2	recommended
2	you can go to the site and find lots f ideas for water saving - awesome !
2	arrived next_day .
2	can '_t complain_about that .
2	easy to book airport_parking - what else is there to say ?
2	the experience is seemless .
2	update 00 / 00 /_0000 : still like to see a ' loyalty ' scheme ....
2	+++++++++++++++++++
2	i '_ve ordered many_times from ilumi over the past few_months .
2	the range is very tasty and makes a great lunch at work .
2	the delivery is exceptionally quick - mostly next_day .
2	i '_ve ordered mostly because of the offers - and will have to consider whether to continue when they cease .... maybe ...?
2	the offers keep_coming - maybe they will put in place a ' loyalty ' scheme ?
2	cicar were the correct choice for our holiday hire car .
2	they had reasonable prices with no_hidden_extras .
2	we had originally booked with a competitor , whose price suddenly was going to need the addition of the cost of a full_tank of petrol ( what a scam )!
2	it didn_'_t take me long to cancel and rebook with cicar following a 0 min search on the internet from others singing their_praises .
2	no upfront deposit until collection ; paperwork was done in minutes , both on collection and drop - off ; car was clean and functional .
2	will_definately_use them next time .
2	prices were excellent .
2	mobile fitter was fantastic .
2	everything happened on time ( on sunday ) without a problem .
2	would strongly_recommend this service - it saved me a fortune and was entirely hassle_free .
2	emma made this happen for me in terms of getting the item delivered - she gets 0_stars .
2	prices are great - definitely 0_stars .
2	huge problems getting in contact with the company and 00 day delivery time caused me a lot of worry - i honestly thought i ' d been_scammed .
2	the goods delivered were perfect and exactly as ordered .
2	if they had said on their web_site that delivery would take 00 - 00 days then i would still have ordered from them and would have been happy to give them 0_stars .
2	website was clear about different options and helped to select which to choose .
2	process was simple and straightforward and quick .
2	i received instant email confirmation and was kept_informed of progress .
2	site was well_laid_out and easy to navigate and gave_me confidence to proceed with my order .
2	really quality online shopping_experience .
2	after sales emails and delivery info was particularly impressive .
2	it ’_s always simple and fuss free when booking with edinburgh long_term car parking .
2	even when things went wrong for me , they went out of their way to be of swift assistance .
2	great service and will use them time and time again .
2	you should do the same !
2	i ordered two products and was very happy with the three day delivery time .
2	prices are fair .
2	for some reason i didn_'_t expect this level of service from a pet_food supplier , but they really did blow me away !
2	everything was so personal and you could tell they cared dearly about service provision .
2	i ordered some prescription cat_food and it arrived within 0 days of the order .
2	i was able to track the order , so i knew_exactly when it would arrive .
2	this was great , because i needed to be at home to sign for the delivery .
2	significantly , they weren_'_t out to take your money as soon as the order was placed .
2	in fact , my product arrived on the same day that the money was taken from my account .
2	well_done viovet - companies should take a leaf_out of your book .
2	having_shopped_around for the best rate on the open_market , i chose age_partnership to sort it out , and they didn_'_t disappoint .
2	jahan went through all the details with me over the phone , and all was settled in less_than a month .
2	need i say more !
2	000000
2	i shop on line and supplement_warehouse beat everybody prices and service .
2	love this place , it is a one stop does it all .
2	great product and great service ; will use them again .
2	it '_s been so cold needed another pair , because he goes to work by bike 0am .
2	not nice . came in one day brilliant .
2	i have sold two of my collection via watchfinders commission service and only received an excellent service on both_occasions .
2	my contact in watchfinder was a lady_called katie worrall and a consummate professional she is , all of my questions were answered and her feed_back in regard to the sales of my watches were exemplary .
2	i would have no_hesitation in conducting_business with katie and the watchfinder team in the future .
2	my kind_regards ,
2	keith brown .
2	excellent service will use again
2	best chocs ever more please .
2	first_class service , will use again another company i used
2	before let_me down_badly and did not get the full_amount for
2	my phone . but with mazuma great
2	broadband_speed rating found talk_talk slower_than virgin_media but much much_cheaper and easier to understand billing process having been with virgin for a number of years desided to swap as virgin was getting very expensive to use .
2	cost of phone_calls line rental etc .
2	talk_talk much_cheaper . and better customer service too .
2	too many hidden_charges in virgin usage not told until i told them i was switching then tried to offfer a deal , but could , nt match the savings that talk_talk allowed_us to make .
2	excellent service and prices , what else can i say
2	i ordered a rugby shirt from lovell rugby on monday 00th_december , i had a courtesy_call saying that it would , nt be in the day they said .
2	to my astonishment the parcel was in my workplace on thursday 00nd_december .
2	how good is that ??.
2	their prices are brilliant too .
2	i would recommend lovell rugby to anyone . keep_up the good work .
2	steve llanhilleth .
2	i cannot_fault this company for the speed , efficiency , thoroughness and friendly service they provide .
2	i tell anyone who '_s looking to rent to go to them
2	we had a bit of a moth infestation with woolen garments suffering the consequence .
2	the kit we bought from mothkiller provided a comprehensive_range of remedial and preventative measures at a very reasonable price .
2	it was considerably_less_than the dry cleaning bill for the remaining woolen clothes !
2	would heartily_recommend mothkiller for the quality and price of their products , and the very fast delivery
2	i ordered a pannier rack which arrived very quickly and well_packaged .
2	unfortunately , i had missunderstood the description , and it wasn_'_t suitable for my bike .
2	i contacted the company who were very understanding , and allowed_me to return the rack for a full_refund , which was paid very quickly .
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending discountbicycles , and will try to use them again in the future .
2	kept_informed at every_step , and item received very well_packaged
2	prompt shipment & well_packaged
2	second time i '_ve_used this company with no_problems with items being depatched in the quoted_timescale
2	i have used this site many_times and have always been very happy with its products , ease of use and very speedy delivery , you get a confirmation_email straightaway with order number , good quality product at reasonable prices .
2	i will be back to shop again .
2	great website , with great prices and very user_friendly .
2	wide_range of products and will no doubt be back after_seeing the upgrades section .
2	order no .
2	000000000
2	i sse that a test of how good a company is , is how they deal with problems , all business experience problems , this is a fact of life .
2	my experience was that i decided to order a new pair of reading_glasses , having ordered two_pairs before i was happy to place a repeat order .
2	having found the glasses of choice i placed my order .
2	it took a few_days but i was informed by email that my chosen glasses were no_longer available to sfe , they asked me to select an_alternative style .
2	this took me a few weeks due to being away .
2	i selected a slightly_different style which were actually slightly_higher price .
2	sfe came back to me immediately asking me to confirm the colour of frame i wanted .
2	once confirmed i received the glasses within 00 days with a notification email to say they had been despatched .
2	the glasses came delievred in a case with a polishing cloth , both of which i had not ordered .
2	overall i am very happy with the service and would recommend to use them .
2	another point worth_noting is that they are asking customers to openly review them which is a clear_indication of good management and desire to improve .
2	well_done sfe .
2	the help line was fantastic in helping_us book a flight - highly_recommended
2	sent and faxed more security confirmation information than requested and still opodo couldn_'_t deliver .
2	completely_unhelpful line staff and managers - i wouldn_'_t recommend this lot to anyone .
2	shame there isn_'_t a zero_star_rating !
2	great on line pharmacy .
2	super_fast delivery , no annoying or embarrassing questions .
2	was emailed to say goods dispatched and turned_up next_day .
2	will use again .
2	i have used blt for several purchases over the last years .
2	a range of low_energy , led and spot lights have been ordered and delivered swiftly .
2	one return was dealt_with in an exemplary manner .
2	a discounted price for a very popular item with no_hidden_extras .
2	despatched swiftly and efficiently .
2	a standard by which to judge other_companies .
2	used grippy once before , and was happy with service , so i '_m using them again .
2	excellent choice of tryes .
2	initially i was told my htc one would be a couple of days , then 0 days , then looking online it said order for 0 days delivery .
2	my telephone_enquiries , twice , to a friendly natalie ( there are two natalies there apparently ) who , despite_being friendly , " couldn_'_t " get any information from the suppliers about delivery timescales .
2	i didn_'_t have any major complaints about the time taken to get through to someone , about 0 - 0 minutes each time i called .
2	no worse than anywhere_else .
2	i did actually email to cancel my order , as i ' d found one " in stock " elsewhere , only to find out it wasn_'_t in stock by the time i ' d had my order processed .
2	ironically , my cancel request hadn_'_t been dealt_with , and i got a dispatch email the same day .
2	phone arrived the next_day , and i '_m very happy with it and the deal .
2	my pc has_been so sluggish lately , and i hadn_'_t kept up with the technology .
2	so after using a few online tools to find out what was inside my pc , i found what memory_chips i needed .
2	headed off to google and found mr_memory .
2	good value , prompt delivery , pc speeded_up no end .
2	i wanted to buy a piano for my wife .
2	i have no idea about pianos or playing them .
2	i do know how to research .
2	i found uk_pianos break down of the key elements of pianos simple to understand and i found the rating system a useful_tool to comprehend what i was potentially buying and how to get value for money .
2	naturally i researched uk_pianos and graham_howard as well .
2	naturally i found many different attitudes towards uk_pianos and graham ; it is a competitive market place !
2	living in australia , buying a piano from uk_pianos was never going to be an option and yet graham gave_me his time and the benefit of his experience .
2	a man and a business that shares ideas and promotes the things he_loves is surely worth considering if you are looking to buy a piano .
2	i purchased an item from lindy . uk and completed the transaction , including the credit_card approval .
2	then a few_days_later i was then informed that the item couldn_'_t be sent to south_africa and i should get the item from lindy international .
2	the item wasn_'_t available on lindy international .
2	i have been a registered lindy client for ages and lindy know my home address so i can '_t understand_why i wasn_'_t informed as i attempted to complete the transaction .
2	recently took delivery of their touch sense e_- pipe and i have to say i '_m pleased with it .
2	initially i had a small issue with getting started but they got me sorted in no time .
2	great customer_care !
2	i got a great exchange_rate from this firm .
2	they sent me details of their bank_account ( lloydstsb ) in order for me to do a bacs_transfer and the money arrived by registered signed - for post the next_day .
2	lovely_jubbly !
2	i ordered my boots two_days_later they arrived in the post .
2	whats not to like ?
2	!
2	i have used interparcel many_times and always found their service to be quick ,
2	efficient , and reasonably_priced .
2	parcels are picked_up when they say they will be and all my parcels have arrived at their destination the next working day , this is no mean_feat as i live on the isle of wight ( yeah !
2	no penalising surcharge from interparcel for living here ).
2	if you have parcels you want delivering try interparcel , you will be amazed at the price , it was , much_cheaper_than " you know who " by more than £_00 . 00 .
2	i will never use any other delivery service as long as interparcel are there ... get on the net and google them thats how i first found them ... first_class service
2	i searched extensively on line for power - saving lamps , but didn_'_t want the nasty " compact fluorescent " or the dim and useless led types .
2	halogen replacements for conventional lamps fit the bill exactly .
2	they have truly white light , and save more than 00_% of the energy of the tungsten lamps they replace .
2	they ' re not as " green " as some of the alternatives , but they give sparkling white bright_light !
2	i don_'_t want to return to the " dark_ages " so these are perfect .
2	power_tools direct offered the lamps i wanted at a great price .
2	they turned_up on time , well_packed and at a great price !
2	forget the nasty , dim " green " lamps - go with the dimmable halogens !
2	i have completely given up dealing_with maplin .
2	i used to use them as an_emergency supplier for the small_quantities of particular values of components i need for development work .
2	i don_'_t any more .
2	their prices are ridiculous , and their sales staff don_'_t know or care about the things they ' re meant to be selling .
2	their stock is invariably at variance with the data on their computer ( in every branch i '_ve ever been in to ).
2	i '_ve given up trying to buy anything from them - even in dire emergency .
2	i can get all the components that maplin sell at less_than 0 / 00th of the maplin price by shopping elsewhere .
2	that '_s for small_quantities .
2	when i want to bulk - buy , maplin are often 000 times more_expensive !
2	please avoid at all costs !
2	the sooner this company dies off the better for everyone .
2	please boycott them and shop elsewhere .
2	virgin took over our local cable tv network from telewest .
2	telewest were just short of completely hopeless , but virgin actually manage to be worse !
2	they claim that they can provide a " 00 mb / s " service .
2	they can '_t .
2	it '_s seriously restricted at peak_periods , and never achieves the speeds they claim at any time .
2	worse yet , they have arbitrarily applied download limits ( that are never consistent ), and when their random restrictions kick in , the speed is reduced to 0 / 00th of the maximum that you can get ( which is never as advertised ).
2	their advertising is probably fraudulent - they fail to mention their random restrictions or that their network never really achieves the advertised speeds .
2	they are also spectacularly expensive for a poor service .
2	it is not a fibre - optic network ( as widely advertised ) - bits of it may be , but most of it is the cheapest , nastiest coaxial cable that they could_find , and is rapidly rotting , giving all_sorts of intermittent faults and random reductions in their already compromised data rates .
2	i gave up after the eighth or ninth major outage .
2	vm '_s " customer service " assumes that the customer is clueless , and lies to their customers by telling them that there '_s " nothing wrong ", or " it '_s your fault - your computer must be faulty ", usually refusing to progress faults because " nobody_else in your street has complained "!
2	back when this network was run by cable camden , the uptake in the neighbourhood was 00 %.
2	their service wasn_'_t perfect , but at_least they didn_'_t lie to their customers !
2	since the various changes of ownership , less_than 00_% of the households around here remain connected to the abysmal cable " service ".
2	if i could rate them with 0_stars , i would !
2	very fast delivery - good quality - very good price - all together a ++++++
2	really good value for money , especially with the annual_subscription .
2	prompt correction of errors .
2	super collection of offerings .
2	the prices at simplyelectronics are good , in comparison with many other_suppliers .
2	the service is attentive .
2	the goods arrive secure , undamaged , and in good time .
2	one couldn_'_t ask for much more .
2	the price of the aftershave was the cheapest i could_find and that along with the brilliant allround service it was a great deal , first_class
2	great and attentive service , comfortable and economic car contibuted to a wonderful holiday experience
2	good products and great delivery !
2	very useful question and answer section on the website that helps when deciding which products to buy .
2	buying glasses online is a bit_scary i guess , but with their " home_trial " option and great phone customer service , it needn_'_t be scary at all .
2	the home_trial , ordering , sending back for adjustments was all painless .
2	and a great range of styles not available on the high_street .
2	great service , speedy delivery .
2	i have now had several items from brook_taverner direct and , without_exception , i have been impressed with the quality .
2	even at the full price their products would be fair value for money but when they offer significant discounts they are unbeatable .
2	their customer service is courteous and efficient and deliveries have always been reliable .
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending brook_taverner .
2	goods arrived as scheduled but packaging damaged in transit .
2	phoned celplas who immediately promised to re - ship before receiving damaged goods back .
2	sure_enough , goods arrived next_day this time undamaged .
2	excellent customer service .
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending this company .
2	all items i ordered were received by courier the following_day .
2	if they have what you want at the right price then don_'_t hesitate to use this company .
2	i will_certainly be buying from them again .
2	placed an order online on friday_afternoon received a telephone_call on sunday_afternoon to tell me they didn_'_t have the colour i wanted but could supply an_alternative .
2	i confirmed alternative colour by telephone at 0 . 00 am monday_morning item delivered 0 . 00 am tuesday_morning .
2	this kind of customer service coupled_with some of the lowest_prices around makes this a first_class company to buy from .
2	thoroughly_recommended .
2	quick reliable service .
2	if they have what you want , at the right price , then have no_worries_about their service .
2	excellent value for money and impeccable service from varerum . dk .
2	delivery to uk within 0 days as promised .
2	i was initially_apprehensive_about buying from non uk base particularly as the prices were so much_better_than uk competitors but based on my experience i would have no_hestitation in using varerum again and would recommend any uk users to seriously_consider buying from this company .
2	stumbled_upon this supplier thro google .
2	they had the product i wanted at half the price amazon were charging so i decided to take a punt .
2	no_worries , the item was delivered the day after_placing the order , securely_packed and post free .
2	this company is now on my favourites_list in front of amazon !
2	bad management , giving out spurious delivery information , out of date working practises , bargain_basement infrastructure , high staff turn over , cutting own throat with internet parcel firms as customers , and the majority of staff not caring a toss possibly make them the worst courier firm in the world
2	vodaphone are bunch of thieves that can not be trusted their broadband coverage and customer_services are rubbish .
2	do not enter in a dodgy contract with them as they do not negotiate and will set their debt bully boys on you .
2	my master bought me some food from bestpet and i couldn_'_t wait for it to arrive .
2	fortunately i didn_' have to wait long as it was delivered very quickly and the price he paid was so reasonable that he could also buy me a toy as well .
2	without a doubt the worst company i have had the misfortune to deal with .
2	a month to receive an sd_card is crazy .
2	i doubt i would have received it then without numerous_emails and a threat to cancel my order .
2	believe me , you do not want to deal with this company .
2	excellent service .
2	the dog_food i ordered arrived very quickly and communication_regarding the order was very good .
2	on top of all this was a great price which made the whole_transaction a good experience .
2	my order from pet_supermarket was delivered quickly and well_packed . the website is easy to use and the prices are very competetive .
2	all in all an excellent company to deal with .
2	having done some_research i decided to use pc_specialist to build my new pc .
2	now i have recieved my pc i know i made the right choice .
2	pc_specialist live up to their name , the pc is well built with top_notch components and reasonably_priced .
2	communicatin is first_rate and shold you have any questions then they will happily answer them speedily and accurately . all in all a great company to deal with .
2	thanks andy , i will recommend to friends
2	good website , with a phone number if you need to speak to someone .
2	good prices and fast service .
2	never ever lost a parcel of mine and always delivered very quickly despite some neg reviews this company has i cannot_fault them
2	bought a deal on solar garden_lights 00 in total for £_00 - 00 .
2	saving over £_00 - 00 according to wowcher , however when i checked on the suppliers website ( kingfisher ) these '' expensive '' solar_lights were actually 00p ....... yes 00pence each if bought direct !!!
2	so my wowcher '' deal '' was not a deal at all .
2	i have already redeemed the wowcher but not yet received the goods so i emailed them telling them to cancel the order and refund me .
2	surprise_surprise no reply at all .
2	lucky i paid via_paypal i have asked them to step in and refund me .
2	so as they say buyer_beware if it seems too good to be true ...
2	it probably is !
2	wont deal with them again custermer service would have been zero_stars
2	believe me being a thrifty yorkshireman , i trawled the net looking for cheap heathrow parking .
2	believe me these_guys are it .
2	you wont buy cheaper search for hours if you dont believe me ( i already did thi though !!!)
2	very easy to order and pay , website was clear ( unfortunately the product was not available on the day but the eta date was provided ).
2	delivery was excellent as the courier provided a specific delivery time , so i did not have to wait in all day for it to arrive .
2	order id :_000000000
2	every time i order from tredz i know i am going to get the best price , service and quickest delivery available .
2	unbeatable !

2	exellent service would use again
2	i only have a very rare need to send flowers so don_'_t have much to compare serenata_flowers with , but i have to say the service has_been excellent .
2	they '_ve kept me informed of the progress of the order thru text_messages and emails so i could almost visualise where the flowers were .
2	also , i didn_'_t think i ' d be able to order flowers on a sunday_night for next_day delivery but they did it .
2	the recipient is delighted with the bouquet and i '_ve got some ' brownie_points '!
2	what more can i say ..
2	delighted with the goods and service from wholesaleclearance .
2	wouldnt_hesitate to buy again .
2	included super_fast service on the two occasions we have purchased goods .
2	their communications are first_class too .
2	i ordered some speakers .
2	they arrived as requested , on time and in working order .
2	sometimes just doing things right is all you need to do to be excellent .
2	very quick to reply to questions and look into cashback problems .
2	good , clear answers , and follow_up when necessary .
2	highly_recommended .
2	thanks .
2	prices are reasonable , delivery free above £_000 , and in 0 days , well_packaged and the tracking_information was sent , which was accurate .
2	thanks .
2	ordered a samsung phone , order accepted but remained at that status for ages , then order being prepared for ages .
2	very difficult to get through to customer service , 00mins on hold .
2	most emails did not get a reply .
2	excuses when you could get through were lots of orders for the same phone , however , stock level showed at 00 for most of the period .
2	they were polite .
2	emailed to cancel , and that process did happen , and the credit_card has_been refunded ( 0_weeks after order placed ).
2	if you are not in a rush , might be worth the risk , but vb need to be more honest about their delivery status and stock_levels .
2	buyer_beware !!
2	!
2	do you know , it '_s soo easy to shop and get a bargain online with ebuyer . com , their website is quick and easy to find what you want at the price you want and ordering and delivery is fast and value for money !
2	the whole service was conducted well , with the offer via the website quick qnd easy , information on how to reset the phone so private_data is erased , and the return envelope arriving quickly .
2	emails sent on reciept of phone by envirofone and the payment ( i adopted to rec argos_card for 00_% more ) sent quickly .
2	highly_recommended !
2	they gave_me the mattress i wanted and efficient next_day delivery thank u .
2	less_than 00_hours my i phone 0 unlocked ,
2	having seen the product i wanted to buy ( r / c helicopter ) i placed my order during the early evening on boxing_day , which was a thursday .
2	i paid a couple of pounds extra for guaranteed saturday delivery .
2	on the friday , i got an email_telling my my order had been despatched , along with tracking_details for the courier '_s website .
2	my helicopter arrived first thing saturday_morning .
2	top_notch service in my book !
2	found what i wanted on the website easily .
2	order placed , acknowledgement received and goods followed a couple of days_later .
2	it really doesn_'_t get much_easier than this .
2	oh_yes - goods arrived really well_packed and in first_class order .
2	job_done .
2	i was pleased with the service and would recommend it .
2	the desk top i bought from pc s a year_ago impressed me by price , the way they dealt_with the order and the after sales help ( the guy actually taught me bits of windows 0 & i doubt that was his job really ).
2	so when i needed a new laptop one of the quotes i requested was from them , again the price was very good and by specifying just what i needed the components that were important to me had my budget concentrated there .
2	the delivery was within that which they predicted ( 00 working_days ) although it is worrying that their website says it can be up to 00 days ( working_days ?
2	!
2	).
2	the laptop looks good and performs well .
2	i ' d recommend them to my friends .
2	had a problem with a shower mat purchased 00 months_ago - contacted showerdoc and within 0 working_days had received a replacement together with packaging and prepaid_label to return the faulty item .
2	there are very few internet traders that would not insist on the customer returning faulty items before they would even consider replacement and then invariably with low_cost items such as this give their customer so much hassle in the hope they will give up .
2	well_done showerdoc - great customer service to be throughly_recommended .
2	nice product just what i wanted easy to fit
2	the service was great the prices were good i would recommend to all my friends
2	service very good prices spot on have no_complaints whatsoever would reccomend gadget box too all my friends .
2	i have just purchased a rickenbacker 000 fireglo and i am over the moon with the service i recieved also the price was over £_000 cheaper_than other_suppliers why shop anywere_else colin
2	i did send a . e_mail when i recieved my guitar because i wsa so pleased with the service i recieved and the quality of the product all_round first_class many_thanks colin
2	this site is without an h in the site , i would recommend this site if you require fair prices for your bottles it can only get better , but not much in my view billiebeth0
2	hello thank_you for a great first transaction no_problems i will be back regards william paget
2	been looking for some time for self_adhesive magnetic sheet .
2	either more than i needed or way too expensive .
2	really pleased with the selection from first0magnets , ( i bought more than just the magnetic sheet i was looking for ), their prices and the next_day delivery .
2	good to find such a customer_focused company .
2	i have dealt_with ao in the past .
2	their service was excellent and they have out done themselves with my latest purchase , a miele drier , delivered on time by two very friendly delivery men , i was kept up to speed with every_step of the delivery process , the sales staff and driver texting or phoning letting_me know the delivery was on time thus allowing us to get on with our work and knowing the text would give us time to return home for the delivery driver .
2	only a small order , some beadlock wheels , but was a good price and was dispatched quickly .
2	update 00 weeks on from wrens response below :
2	we are still_waiting for a larder door to be delivered and installed .
2	i did speak to chris baker the area manager , but he was unhelpful , failed to take_responsibility and also failed to call back .
2	i believe that my original review below failed to make clear how endemic the poor management and customer service at wren is .
2	we have purchased at_least 00 kitchens in the last 00 years .
2	we have had a few problems and been frustrated at times , but these issues were always resolved quickly .
2	wren is by far the worst kitchen company we have ever had the misfortune to deal with .
2	they have had at_least seven attempts to get our order right , but we are still 0 items away from a complete kitchen .
2	we do not know if we will ever get a complete kitchen .
2	the account_manager has_been disinterested and does not even bother calling back .
2	the store manager is ineffective .
2	he is unable to organise , or expedite anything .
2	he has no idea what is going on and hides_behind that as an excuse .
2	the area manager is even worse .
2	he takes no responsibility what so ever and is completely ineffective .
2	this company is absolutely_useless at communication and customer service .
2	it now looks_like the wait for the doors will extend to three or four months .
2	we ordered the kitchen a couple of months in advance this would not happen if they had proper systems and procedures in place .
2	wren give the impression that this is business as usual for them .
2	if you don_'_t mind your kitchen being unusable for three_months , by all means buy from wren .
2	if you want a professional service , then look_elsewhere .
2	update_: it looks_like the years interest free credit will have run out by the time we have a complete kitchen .
2	buy your somewhere_else !
2	!
2	please ignore wrens reply_below - it just did not happen !
2	!
2	ordered 0 lights , so_far have received only two good lights and six damaged lights .
2	have spent over an_hour at a time trying to get through to their customer service line , but there is no customer service .
2	i have reported this by email , but they do not bother to reply .
2	there seem to be far too many reviewers reporting the same experience .
2	look at the huge number of appalling reviews for this company and make up your own mind as to their true level of customer service .
2	my advice - for now , avoid this company at all costs .
2	wait to see if the company either improves its service to , or fails .
2	forgot to add that i also cut my hand on one of the broken lights - they do not bother to pack them properly .
2	ps .
2	i tried the [_private_data_] phone number mentioned below , but it has_been deactivated now . hardly_surprising .
2	excellent item , service , delivered when they said they would ... what more can one ask for ... thank_you .
2	compre un iphone de segunda mano de os uk y en_una semana liberado , tal y_como anuncian .

2	wow - what a great service funding_circle is .
2	we were looking for a working capital loan and wanted something in place quickly .
2	taking the traditional route and talking to the bank first was painful and drawn_out , and we could see they just couldn_'_t work fast enough for our needs .
2	we looked to crowd funding as we had heard how much more flexible and quick it was .
2	we choose funding_circle as they presented a professional setup and knew what they were talking_about .
2	it took just 0_weeks ( including the easter_bank_holidays ) to apply , be funded and receive monies in our bank .
2	that never happens with traditional lending institutions .
2	i am sure we will be looking to funding_circle again in the future as we continue to grow .
2	i '_ve_used event at_least four times previously and they '_ve never_let_me down on price , selection or availability for booking .
2	shane the fitter was very helpful and text me the day before confirming a two hour_slot when he would arrive .
2	why go_anywhere_else when event come to you ?
2	?
2	best prices for the items i was looking for , all in stock and quick delivery which meant i was able to get my new install up and running the same weekend .
2	jeremy was very helpful , and ensured we got exactly_what we wanted .
2	turn_around time from order to delivery was great .
2	i have bought loads of items from midshires - they always deliver quickly , and have some of the best prices out there .
2	“ great service for an excellent product !
2	will use again !”
2	i '_ve been using agoda regularly now for about 0 years .
2	they always do exactly_what they say they will do .. thats every time !
2	!
2	website is usually very accurate , in description , and says what is to be expected in the hotel on arrival .
2	i '_ve_used their services in more than one country , and service is the same no matter which .
2	i thoroughly_recommend them , fpr all your holiday or business needs as far as hotels are concerned .
2	excellent product and service .
2	their review of items is honest and their price fantastic !
2	great delivery - next_day with real time gps tracking .
2	can '_t recommend enough !
2	thanks
2	my wife was looking for 0 wall_lights to compliment our existing central ceiling_light .
2	this is not a job for the faint hearted !
2	i found her some web sites which she trawled with great trepidation ..... what if the goods were cheap looking or what if they arrived damaged and will they look like the pictured image ?
2	thankfully we had no_problems .
2	the goods were exactly to her taste , delivered quickly and well_protected .
2	0_star service
2	the web_site was easy to navigate , and i soon found the guest_bed area that i was searching .
2	the extent of their stock and availability put other major suppliers to shame ( tesco + john_lewis ).
2	the bed that i wanted was showing a 00 / 00 day delivery lead time , but a quick phone_call confirmed that the stock had arrived in , and i could have delivery next_day .
2	a bit too soon for me as i was decorating , so we chose a day the following week , confirmed by email , and everything_went_smoothly .
2	the bed is of a very high_standard , and meets all my expectations , for the price that i paid .

2	walton on thames
2	we '_ve_used them twice_now , with no_problems at all .
2	they keep you informed , and take_note of any info or instructions you give them .
2	they do try to sell you extended_warranties , but will take a firm no as an answer , so - full_marks !
2	samantha from parcel0gogo was the epitome of good service help .
2	she understood my problem immediately , quickly identified the mistake i was making , and suggested a solution - which worked first time .
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending samantha and parcel0go .
2	john mcmillan
2	this all went through in a timely_manner and the glasses were good value .
2	i would suggest people are very careful in choosing glasses with very similar dimensions to what they have as in my experience it is impossible to just choose by what a picture looks_like .
2	just use the tool provided to search on specs with given dimensions .
2	take your time ...
2	john
2	i found ordering from the site , easy without problems .
2	my recipient in belgium was really pleased with the flowers and the delivery was excellent .

2	they delivered on time and with no damage to my parcel .
2	the courier was courteous and helpful .
2	i really like knowing to the hour when my parcel is going to arrive - most other couriers couldn_'_t seem to care less - dpd is an exception .
2	i have had nothing but good service from dpd .
2	their tracking page on the website seems to function well and it is easy to find out how your parcel is progressing .
2	if i had parcels to send , i would use dpd - don_'_t use city_link - they are a real_pain .
2	pc_specialist ltd . made choosing a pc to my specification easy .
2	the ordering_process was straightforward and the configuration chosen was automatically vetted for difficulties during the purchasing procedure .
2	build urgency and delivery options were clear and my order was efficiently built and delivered .
2	progress emails were informative without being_overbearing .
2	i had every confidence my pc was going to be delivered on time with no_hassle and it was .
2	i did send an email to pc_specialist at one point to query the delivery email , a prompt courteous reply was sent informing_me everything was ok . pc_specialist ltd . used dpd to ship my pc and it was delivered within the hour given by them for delivery and arrived well_packed and undamaged .
2	the pc and supporting_documentation was all nicely_presented and it was easy to install and start using it .
2	i am very pleased with the pc i chose and would like to thank pc_specialist ltd . for a complex task well_done - thank_you , i would not_hestitate to order from you again in the future .
2	i '_ve been using supplementwarehouse . com for quite some time now and after comparing_prices and the promptness of receiving my order , supplementwarehouse . com will_continue to have my business .
2	the freebies aren_'_t bad either !
2	managed to get a great deal on a return ferry trip dover to calais .
2	lucky that ferries ( both_ways ) were relatively quiet , so plenty of space to sit and get around .
2	but onboard costs were very high .
2	and service was poor too .
2	for example , there was no queue in the restaurant , so we went for some food .
2	asked what was available and were told that only breakfast items were available .
2	not happy , but ordered 0 breakfasts at a stupid cost .
2	we paid and sat down .
2	immediately behind us , the next people sat down with fish and chips !
2	what happened to ' breakfast only '?
2	this company offered the cheaper price by about £_00 .
2	i took a gamble and placed an order .
2	it was downhill from that point on !
2	the item was quoted as ' in stock ' with delivery ' in three_days '.
2	it took almost two months to be delivered .
2	note - there is no telephone_number to contact and eqnuire about an order .
2	there is no address to write to .
2	there is an e_- mail address , but a complete_waste of time as they don_'_t answer it .
2	i wrote perhaps 00 or 00 e_- mails_asking for the whereabouts of my purchase .
2	no replies .
2	please do not buy from this company .
2	it just isn_'_t worth the risk .
2	what if something_goes_wrong ?
2	the item is faulty ?
2	you can '_t contact them !
2	completely_useless .
2	i would much rather have spent an extra £_00 and bought from a reputable_company .
2	i also wish i had paid more heed to the other reviews i have now seen on the web .
2	only bad_reviews everywhere .
2	faulty items .
2	incorrect items .
2	lost items .
2	unable to contact them .
2	unable to obtain refunds .
2	they shouldn_'_t be allowed to carry on business .
2	do not buy from them !
2	item collected from basildon tues 00rd apr_0000 00 : 00 and arrived at hatfield terminal mon 00th apr_0000 00 : 00 - 0 days to travel 00 + miles ( about an_hour ), presumably the plants stayed in the truck over easter_weekend .
2	as it has now 000 approx miles to travel ( without accounting for more depots stops ).
2	000 / 00x0 = 00 days to delivery - shall not be happy if they are only fit for compost heap .
2	ironically the plants are coming from a company called gardening_express !
2	!.
2	yodel tracking does say ' we are sorry , but it appears ?
2	your parcel has_been delayed '
2	whilst this website seems to have mostly favourable_reviews same cannot be said for all web review sites .
2	will comment further on delivery .
2	have always bought from high_street shop / supermarket before and have obviously wasted money .
2	excellent value and prompt ( within 00_hours ) delivery .
2	in original_packaging and long shelf_life .
2	nearly four weeks_ago out of interest took out free subscription .
2	no_problems accessing credit_report but as i expected there were no_problems .
2	have just cancelled and , after_reading various reviews , expected to be kept waiting on the phone .
2	no such problem , whole_process took less_than five_minutes .
2	yes , was asked why i am leaving and offered reduced subscription and other offers but no undue pressure .
2	a very efficient service , no_problems_whatsoever at very favourable rates , would recommend them to friends and other family_members , likewise i would have no_hesitation in using can can again when needed myself .
2	i used it for the first time recently and received some good quotes before accepting a very cheap one .
2	i was also very happy with the company that picked_up my items .
2	the very website is easy to use .
2	i had a three year contract with vodafone and not once did they treat me like a valued_customer until my contract was up , then they pestered me constantly with quite rubbish offers .
2	when i started the contract i attempted to have my existing number transferred over to vodafone but after two_weeks it wasn_'_t done so i settled for another number .
2	when i switched to another server i attempted to have my number switched over to my new server but vodafone has not done this and it has_been a month !
2	i '_ve been without a mobile number for one month !
2	i begrudge even giving them one star !
2	i '_ve bought two phones from them .
2	one for a three year contract and one for a pay as you go .
2	there were problems with both .
2	i won_'_t be using them again .
2	ebay has a dismissive and very ignorant policy against its sellers and encourages buyers to act in horrendous ways by instilling them with all the power .
2	i began to sell on amazon and quickly became frustrated with the allocated postage_costs on books which does not take into_consideration different_sizes and weights .
2	this made me have to cancel two sales transactions of a large and heavy book and a five disc and booklet of a music cd box set .
2	until the company deals with this complexity in a fair manner towards the seller i won_'_t be using it again .
2	the salesman chris was extremely friendly and helpful when i purchased 0 phones for my daughter and myself .
2	phones arrived extremely quickly and i am very glad i purchased through buymobile . net yet again .
2	highly_recommend for no_nonsense deals .
2	the best phone_recycler i have found .
2	my family and i have used them numerous_times now .
2	cannot_fault .
2	each time i have found them fast and the money is in the bank as promised without_delay .
2	what '_s more they keep you updated of the progress by e_- mail every_step of the way .
2	till the next time .
2	as usual , your chap is reliable , friendly , and helpful .
2	having a home visit is a massive benefit compared with standing around in a draughty garage .
2	i recently_bought a power_supply unit for a new computer but after about two hours it went bang ( literally ).
2	i called them the next_day and within about 00 seconds they had fixed up a next_day collection and replacement .
2	no_arguments , no_hassle , no charge .
2	unfortunately they don_'_t have a massive_range of stuff like dabs and saverstore but they don_'_t only stock " quiet " things .
2	they might be slightly more_expensive , but when things go_wrong , or if you want to speak to them about a product , they ' re brilliant .
2	have a look next time you buy something .
2	a million_miles apart_from when i tried to return a faulty motherboard to dabs .
2	i was very happy with my dealings with mazumba_mobile , they dealt_with my deal quick and fast , money was in my bank within a couple of days of them receiving the mobiles .
2	i would recommend mazuma_mobile to everyone , because of the way they dealt_with my deal .
2	thankyou
2	mazuma
2	the goods are competitively_priced and arrive quickly .
2	when i made an error they sorted_out the problem with no_fuss_whatsoever .
2	thoroughly_recommended .
2	the goods look to be in great condition but as it '_s a gift have not tested anything as yet .
2	shame the box was a little dog - eared but at the price , i can '_t complain .
2	everything was better_than_expected .
2	to find any fault would simply be picky .
2	intelligent lovely guides and a fantastic city .
2	highly_recommended .
2	well_done to the whole pissup prague team .
2	:_o )
2	products packaged well and delivered safely to the uk very quickly ( on 0 separate_occasions ).
2	order process clear and easy .
2	despatch updates effective .
2	thank_you .
2	i was anxious that i would not be home when my consignment was to be delivered but a quick call to customer_services early in the day allayed my fears as a very helpful lady told me i was the last drop_off on the drivers round .
2	it was delivered just within the time limit and in good order with bubble_wrap around the boxes !
2	well_done xdp !
2	!
2	although i did a 00 mile_round_trip to their tunbridge_wells shop it was well_worth it as i saved £_00 on the tv i brought as compared to here in eastbourne .
2	the staff were very helpful as they held the tv until i could get there several days_later .
2	have also used the online service which was also excellent .
2	they kept me informed of my parcels progress by email and text
2	i thought the service was great and the items i ordered were despatched promptly .
2	it is so refreshing to find a company who doesn_'_t rip you off over post & packing .
2	i was having_difficulty_finding the bits i needed for wiring up my wall - mounted tv but kenable came up_trumps !!
2	very satisfied and will use them again
2	cannot_fault simplygames .
2	did a bit of shopping around for fifa_00 and they were the cheapest .
2	placed the order and had delivery a few_days_later .
2	a no_hassle , trustworthy company delivering to my exact_requirements .
2	00 / 00 .
2	well_done .
2	i clicked on insureandgo web link found by google and looked at their website .
2	i had seen their advertisement but had not paid too much attention , they have an excellent service easy no pain application and a great price quotation so i bought my travel_insurance there and then .
2	.
2	i purchased a mini hi_fi system from hi tower which came from germany , i was very impressed with the service , point to point tracking with ups .
2	when the hi_fi was delivered within 00_hours i was astonished and eager to open the packaging , the hi_fi was easy to setup and has excellent quality of sound and has a very easy remote_control for the various functions also with it being nearly flat it fits nicely into the space i reserved for it .
2	thank_you hi tower for quality goods at reasonable prices , and i recommend this seller to anyone .
2	tommy gemmell , schottland
2	valuable web chat confirmed in stock_availability and order for non - listed item too .
2	easy phone ordering .
2	delivery quicker_than_anticipated and very useful phone_calls from distributors to appoint delivery slots .
2	an unusually good all_round experience and would recommend to others .
2	very quick service , kept_informed by email and excellent details for timed delivery , would recommend save on laptops .
2	i have been in shock at the speed of my broadband and will let all my friends know about this great service
2	i bought an ipod_dock from superfi that had to be returned under_warranty .
2	over a prolonged period trying to get the item repaired or replaced , the staff have been evasive & rude .
2	i have made several_visits & phone_calls to the shop and have not had a single call back .
2	never have they taken any responsibility for the situation , blaming in turn the supplier , someone_else in the shop and sometimes even me ..
2	truly_awful customer service
2	doing up our downstairs_cloakroom proved less expensive than we thought , the choice of suites at bathroom city ( online ) is extensive and the site easy to navigate .
2	having someone from the store phone you to check over the details before taking any payment from you is a nice personal_touch and good customer service , as it allows you to put any questions you may have , to a knowledgeable_staff_member , it certainly beats the usual faq list .
2	the courier service they used was efficient , making contact with me to establish a suitable delivery slot and arriving promptly .
2	the quality of the sanitary - ware and fittings is excellent , and the cabinets even better_than i had expected .
2	we will be renovating our upstairs family bathroom once i have had a suitable fallow period , speedy diy isn_'_t really me , and we would certainly be happy to use bathroom city to source our requirements for this job if they maintain their high_standards and competitive_pricing .
2	i am happy to recommend oponeo to all of my friends and colleagues on the basis of wide_choice , good customer service , prompt delivery and attractive pricing .
2	my tickets for the killers at wembley this saturday arrived on wednesday , i have been trying to contact double0 ever_since their phone line does not take messages just says they are very busy and promptly hangs up .
2	i paid £_000 + for what i thought would be 0 x £_00 . 00 face value tickets only to receive 0 x £_00 . 00 tickets .
2	i feel i ` ve been stitched up like a kipper with top tier tickets that should be middle or lower tier and unable to speak to anyone about it .
2	safely_packed and prompt delivery at a great price
2	all went pretty_much to plan , even after the airport did their best to mess things up taxi was still_waiting for us .
2	steve was pleasant to deal with and most helpful , everything_went_smoothly . hope i can now get the tv set_up .
2	i have used superfi for year and they have never failed me their advice , products and price ai doubt are matched anywhere .
2	ordered , paid , came , great price and quick delivery .
2	what more can you ask ?
2	no_problems , would recomend this company to eveyone
2	without_doubt the worst couriers i '_ve ever had to deal with and that '_s not just one experience sadly !!
2	!
2	i ' d sooner not deal with a company using them rather_than have all the hassle !!!
2	virgin please take_note , as i won_'_t be re - newing my phone with you in future if you insist on using yodel , yodel !!
2	more like whistle for it ...
2	well , i made the same mistake , not once , but twice , will i never learn .
2	every time my wife or i have a new mobile from virgin , yodel never deliver when they say they will ...
2	i will only go to a shop in future , and pick it up there and then , at_least it '_s reliable !
2	!
2	very happy with the amount received for our phones .
2	extremely happy with the speed and quality of service .
2	having read various poor reviews of other_companies , i was almost loathed to trust any of them , however mazumamobile certainly gets my vote , and will_certainly use in the future .
2	my wife and i purchased several items at the same time , not only were they great value for the money , but the service we received was second to none .
2	great communication through out , and speedy delivery , which made all the difference .
2	when they arrived the packing on the items , was so well_protected , it took some time to remove packaging but the end_result was well_worth the wait .
2	the finish on the products is top quality , the style looks great and they fit very nicely into the rooms in which we have placed them .
2	we are now looking to purchase more items as we are so pleased , with what we have brought so_far .
2	we highly_recommend these products to everyone .
2	well_done oakfurnitureland and keep_up the good work .
2	i have used this company many_times and have not been disappointed once , also i have had to return items without_any fuss , excellent .
2	i would recommend golfbase to anyone .
2	keep_up the excellent service .
2	my order came in under 00_hours , well_packaged and safeley discrete on the outside with original breeders packs on the inside .
2	they were a good price and with very usable freebies to go with it .
2	i '_ve purchased from herbies a few_times now without a single problem .
2	if you click the banner ads on thctalk then the best percy forum on the net gets to benefit as well .
2	what more can you ask for :-)
2	excellent service and courteous staff
2	will_definately_use again anywhere !
2	!
2	the clue is in the name with this site .... first_class !!!!
2	i ordered my watch from them during the afternoon and it arrived as promised during the morning next_day .
2	i couldn_'_t find my watch cheaper anywhere , their site is simple to use and the selection of watches is second to none - as is their service ....!!
2	i '_m so happy to have found a genuine site that quite obviously appreciates its customers ... you now have a customer for life .
2	thank_you !!!
2	!
2	you get great service and the best price all the time .
2	only place i shop for supplements .
2	had my parcels collected from home without_any_problems , contacted the live_chat operator ( jon ) who was most helpful and answered all my questions in a clear and possitive way .
2	this is one service i will be using many_times in the future ,
2	on recently purchasing the arm strap flute lyre for my daughter to play in the marching band , she tried it on and put the music on to find it very unstable , although this is not normans_music shop fault as this is just a product they sell , i will be going back to norman '_s to purchase the fixed lyre that goes onto the flute !
2	although an excellent service from normans i would highly use them again as the product came very quickly
2	excellent quality eliquids every time and very fast delivery .
2	just one little_niggle ... please keep a bigger stock of my 0 favourite flavours , 000 and apple .
2	i rang as only part of order arrived but got the information i needed in a professional_manor
2	because i live near the actual store in york i asked to collect in person .
2	problems with fraud won_'_t allow this ( understandably ) so they refunded my credit_card , left my guitar on order and i just had to pay in person by chip and pin with my card when i collected .
2	thank_you for great service .
2	frosts unique range of products are a must for car enthusiasts everywhere with reliable quality and good service .
2	i ordered a specialist and expensive battery for my classic car from tayna , not only were they the lowest_price on the net by a significant_amount the battery arrived next_day very well_packed , fully charged and ready to fit .
2	yesterday i wanted a reliable , top quality battery for my caravan as the one left in over winter was not holding much charge but it was 0000hrs and i am going away today .
2	no problem to tayna , the friendly helpful lady on the order line promised it would be with me today but could not promise a time .
2	the battery arrived at_0000hrs was fitted by 0000hrs and i am leaving this afternoon .
2	tayna i think you are great and i am telling all my friends as well .
2	i wanted to try some of the tinted driverware glasses with varifocal_lenses and local_opticians were just too expensive .
2	i thought i would try spec0less and i am so pleased i did .
2	their service has_been excellent from_start to finish and the price is very reasonable .
2	the glasses worked for me straight out of the case with no other adjustment needed and the effect when driving is quite startling especially in semi light conditions , in bright_light my eyes feel much more relaxed .
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending specs0less and i will be back to them next time i need glasses .
2	the code arrived the day after i ordered it .
2	the instructions were straightforward and the phone was unlocked in no time at all .
2	if you need any thing for your computer no matter what it is i would suggest giving this company a view .
2	they are very reasonable on prices and the delivery service is very quick .
2	i will probably be buying an internal hard_drive in the future and this is the first place i will look .
2	they offered the best price for my phone from all the other_companies i contacted nearly twice as much .
2	they let_me know by e_- mail every_step that was happening & when money would appear in my bank_account .
2	i would use them again no problem .
2	thanks for a good service .
2	the prices are very good and the ordering_process is very easy .
2	i ordered on a monday_evening and got my parts on thursday_morning .
2	i was very pleased with the service i received and would recommend them to my friends .
2	i am 00 years old and have always used the " post_office " travel_insurance or a tour_operators policy .
2	as soon as i turned 00 , even although i am healthy and have no medical_history , their premiums rose massively ! your policy is just as good as theirs and the price is excellent . i will be back next time i travel .
2	application on line was also quick and easy .
2	i found " age_partnership " to be a first_class firm .
2	service was friendly and efficient - they did everything i asked them to . i would particularly commend andrew lea and lisa cook for all the help they gave_me .
2	i would certainly use " age_partnership " again .- fred pegg .- 000000
2	flew with jet0 from east_midlands to gran_canaria and return .
2	flights were on time , efficient pleasant staff , absolutely no problem , will happily book with them again .
2	after_submitting my emie number , had a reply within minutes saying they were working on it .
2	i then realised i submitted an incorrect number .
2	i re - submitted it again , ( and again ).
2	( my eyesight is not what it used to be ).
2	even after my errors got the unlock_code as promised and it worked great .
2	orange wanted £_00 + for the same service .
2	cellunlocker were half that price even taking account of my errors .
2	well_done cellunlocker .
2	recommended 000_%.

2	placed an order for 0x0lt tins of wood_preservative just before 0pm , had an email conformation by 0 . 00pm stating delivery will be the next_day , then had text from courier to say delivery will be between 00 and 00am , and it was delivered within the time_scale , from just before 0pm one day to delivery completed just after 00am the next_day , can '_t get better_than that , excellent service from wood_finishes direct and good choice of courier .
2	very fast and problem free service , many_thanks would use again .
2	searched the internet for a north_face gilet to go with my other north_face coats & outdoor_kit are without_doubt the best , lowest_prices anywhere and rapid delivery , will always use these_guys for future orders , well_done , keep_up the good work , many_thanks
2	ordered a 0kg ham for christmas day .
2	arrived as requested on the 00rd_december .
2	everyone at the dinner table said it was the highlight of the meal and i will_certainly be ordering again , do not know if i will be able to wait_until next christmas though .
2	competent , friendly service .
2	mike fitted the tyre in no time flat (!).
2	shall_certainly use them again - certainly beats sitting_around in a reception_area wondering how long the job will take .
2	does_exactly_what it ' says on the tin '
2	i went into the shop and asked if i could have glasses the same day .
2	they said yes if they had the lenses so i asked them to check if they had them for a pair of glasses and a spare pair .
2	they had and produced them .
2	i chose frames then had a fitting .
2	at this point it was getting late so i asked again if i would have my glasses the same day .
2	they said no because the lab was closed all day .
2	i was annoyed but agreed to let them make the glasses up for me on the following_monday and post them to me first_class .
2	the lenses were with the frames when i left the shop .
2	the following wednesday i rang to check they had posted the glasses to me .
2	they said they hadn_'_t because they only had lenses to make up one pair and were waiting for lenses they had ordered for the second pair .
2	i asked to speak to the manager and complained .
2	they are delivering the glasses for me but if i could i would have cancelled the transaction .
2	it is one thing to have a problem but to blatantly lie about it destroys any trust .
2	i will never deal with specsavers again .
2	excellent communications and excellent service .
2	i placed my order for a pair of denon scm00 loudspeakers on the tuesday mid_afternoon and they arrived on the thursday at midday , brilliant .
2	had been looking for ultra_violet pen for marking valuables i even went to my local police_station to no_avail , checked on the internet found what i wanted ordered and received within 00_hours amazing , well_done people highly_recommend
2	i wanted a decent new surround_sound amplifier but at a low price .
2	all my searches led to hi -_fi tower and i got just that .
2	i doubt that you could get a new amp at their prices anywhere_else .
2	also they are willing to solve any_problems promptly with no_fuss .
2	i recommend them .
2	0rd time round for me on glasses purchase and they were very helpful .
2	good selection of frames and when the first pair ( s ) weren_'_t suitable they swapped them for bifocals for just the extra lens charge after i had a very informative chat with one of their opticians .
2	deserve all the success they get .
2	appalling fulfilment ruins this site and i potential_customers not to use it unless you want to wait weeks for your order to arrive and be fobbed_off endlessly by their ' customer service ' team telling you that " it will be there tomorrow ".
2	they seem to show goods as available and then order them in to satisfy your order .
2	then they blam ' supplier problems ' for the delay .
2	i would have thought that if it '_s howing as available on their website then it '_s in stock but apparently not .
2	seems to be run by a bunch of amateurs .
2	i would thoroughly_recommend viovet .
2	not only was their price far less_than other_suppliers , their service was brilliant .
2	the communication from them was superb and the goods were delivered exactly when we were told they would be .
2	i '_ll certainly use them again .
2	i ordered a set of bright - white , battery_powered outdoor led_lights expecting them to not be very good but it would save the hassle and expense of an outdoor socket .
2	i was totally wrong - these lights are fantastic .
2	they are so bright and the batteries last for ages .
2	the build quality is superb and the timer function so simple and straightforward - you turn the lights on , they stay on for 0 hours from that point , then go off for 00_hours , then back on for 0 and so on .
2	my only regret is that i didn_'_t order the money - saving twin_pack ( because i wrongly thought they ' d be rubbish ).
2	great price , extremely fast delivery , smooth and stable website .
2	couldn_'_t be better .
2	whenever i need bike gear always go to chain_reaction first , and that is normally it !
2	on - line order , arrived on time and very pleased with product .
2	product arrived very quickly and well_packed .
2	required invoice at a later date and was emailed within half an_hour .
2	tyres sent to mobile fitter , arrived in 0 days , fitter came the next_day .
2	even after i messed_up a delivery address , they sorted it out on their online_chat .
2	fantastic service !
2	very easy to use website , excellent prices and very fast delivery .
2	excellent service from nikki at helpline , i could not redeem my voucher which she immediatly did for me online , makes_life so much_easier with this type of online help 00 / 0 .

2	friendly staff and a fast service .
2	this bean_bag is excellent and i reccomended that you get one for your front room if only for me to sit in when i come and visit .
2	all my close friends think its cool and my son wants one now so i will be getting him one very soon .
2	the service and delivery were excellent and thte bean_bag and stool perfect for my dining_room .
2	i found this site by chance and i phoned about an item and i was told all i needed to know and more they told me all about what i was about to buy so i bought the item and amazing delivery and when arrived needed more advice so i rang again they were so helpful and said they would rather me phone for info than just do it and damage item i will be using them for all my rc products amazing guys specially stephen .
2	thanks mate .
2	superb service .... very fast delivery and great prices .... these_guys will_definately be getting all my future business .
2	i used to use pharmacy_0u for a lot of my online purchases because historically they never used to charge for delivery .... but now that they charge for delivery they are just the same as any other online pharmacy !
2	0 out of 00 as this site and electrixworld . com are not trading !

2	found this place on google and had a look around .
2	placed my order in at 00 . 00pm and it came the same time the day after .
2	i ordered a ipod_touch 0g a - refurb it was like new in the box .
2	i would defo_use these_guys again .
2	well_done
2	a very easy site to navigate and find exactly_what you want .
2	once ordered the item was delivered very quickly .
2	my first experience of dealing_with this company was extremely positive .
2	this is the first time that i have used powerbody for supplements , however , my initial_impression is very positive as my purchase arrived very quickly .
2	i will_continue to use powerbody for future_purchases .
2	predator_nutrition offer an excellent range of products and their service is very efficient .
2	i have ordered products from them on several_occasions and have been very impressed with the service and the delivery time .
2	i ordered a washing_machine and a fridge_freezer for my new rental premises .
2	trouble_free and good prices , discount for two .
2	i paid for fitting of the washing_machine but the staff who attended were in to much of a hurry to do this properly .
2	that said the company understood and without_quibble refunded that charge .
2	even when they are out of stock they got my watch to me in less_than one week from order .
2	brilliant service and prices that i could not find cheeper anywhere_else .
2	oh and the watch is excellent i am very happy with my purchase .
2	thank_you very much to all involved at express_watches .
2	excellent service and sensible pricing , could not ask for better i will buy again in the future and recommend outdoor_gb .
2	i ordered online from justoffbase and although the website shows stock they did not have any and no planned stock so they refunded my money .
2	they need to work out their stock_levels and list it live on the website to avoid further inconvenience to customers .
2	i placed the order online with a 00 - 00 day delivery on 0th_september and on chasing the order today , which is the 00th_september i am told the sent me an e_- mail on the 0th_september advising that delivery would be 0 - 0_weeks and because they never_heard back they never did anything with the order .
2	on checking the email address they sent it to an e_- mail address that does not exist .
2	would you not phone the client if you never received a response .... very poor !!
2	!
2	ordered friday_afternoon and received the money on saturday_morning so very happy .
2	good rates too .
2	what straight_forward site to use , and best of all it delivers promptly what is seen .
2	i received my order and one item too small i emailed and was told i can exchange item with no_quibble it was completed within in 0days i found it quick and professional service will recommend to anyone and as for quality and prices can '_t be beat brilliant 000 per_cent got my custom well_done and thank_you .

2	in relation to a problem with a shipment , sammie has perfectly understood my problem and was able to give a quick solution , very efficient person , thanks .
2	i ordered an office , they took my money quickly and gave_me a date of 00th_october to have room ready for their fitter .
2	last_week they phoned to say their fitter paul would be with us on monday 00th and make_sure room is completely cleared .
2	0000hrs monday no sign of fitter or furniture , rang customer_services who rang paul and informed me that paul had not been told of my job and that there had been a communications breakdown and they would look into it .
2	0000 no call from customer_services so rang them again still no resolution .
2	also tweeted @ richard hammonds and no reply from him either !
2	late_afternoon and we now have a fitting date of tomorrow and wednesday but it took a lot of explaining the hassle that we had clearing a room into the rest of the house and taking 0 days leave to be here when they decided to come originally and failed .
2	we wait but any joy has now gone as can we really trust them to do a good job ?
2	well after 0 days fitting my 0 day job they have left site with a string of issues still to be sorted_out some small but some completely_unacceptable .
2	the printer cupboard should have 0 sliding shelves as stated on their design diagram , it has none .
2	there are 0 cable hole covers missing , they have made an access hole in one unit to allow access to a power_socket and have cut it with wavy sides just like an diy person might do , there is most of a large bar_code label still stuck onto the front of a cupboard , one screw has_been screwed in and split the veneer .
2	there are other issues other than these and the whole_experience has turned from a joyous expectation to a depressing experience and both of us feel very down and not only that but we still cannot get our house back in order because we are now waiting for a solution , the company promised to get back to us today and fix a date for resolution work , surprise_surprise no call by 0000hrs .
2	during friday we received an_apology for not getting back on thursday and told that a senior technician would be with us between noon and 0pm this thursday to finish installation and rectify issues .
2	the senior technician arrived on the day stated and rectified approximately_half of the 00 + issues leaving us now waiting for the french_polisher to be appointed to maybe finish the job fully .
2	initial date when i contacted customer_services to ask how much longer we were expected to live with 0 of our 0 bedrooms and living_room full up with items from the office area , not unreasonable as so_far our 0 day job has taken 0_weeks and living in this mess is very depressing especially when you read their brochure about their craftsmen taking pride in their work etc .
2	we feel that so_far we have paid more than enough for their below diy skilled installation !
2	we were initially given a date of next friday for the french_polisher but after explaining once again our displeasure of living in a mess for so long already they promised to look into the diary closer , now we have got an appointment for this monday .
2	do these_people realise how depressing living like this is ?
2	given that the issues quoted their expertise in their furniture should have made them realise that a french_polisher would be required , so why was one not booked to come with the senior technician ?
2	once again ( 0rd time so_far ) we have had to delay the flooring fitters , i suspect that they are starting to get fed_up with rearranging their day due to hammond '_s inabilities to complete their work .
2	monday 00th , 0_weeks into the 0 day fit and french_polisher arrives and spends a lot of time and effort trying to fix things but despite his_efforts we are still left with a door that due to it being squashed somewhen has a very noticeable damaged area and a dented cornice that any professional fitter would not have fitted in the first place so still trying to get a resolution .
2	sent photos to their resolution team and have as yet not heard_anything other than standard we have received your message reply .
2	wednesday 00th demand for final payment has arrived in post obviously this is being ignored until we are fully happy with the office .
2	thursday 00th_november_0000 , 0nd french_polisher has_been and carried_out a repair to our new furniture , still have a panel that they owe us to come .
2	is repaired new as good as perfect new and worth as much is the big question and will the repairs last ?
2	my lawyer friend drafted a letter for me giving them until 0st december before we place a claim in a london small_claims court for breach of contract , we sent it recorded delivery but " surprisingly " they could not find the letter so had to send proof of delivery plus a copy of the documentation via_email to them as well .
2	00th_november received text saying panel will be delivered tomorrow between 0000 and 0000hrs - do they assume we are just sitting at home waiting at their beck and call ?
2	phoned to give times that we would be in and enquire as to how much there was outstanding to pay , as i wished to settle the final account on delivery of the panel and for some reason they were unable to tell me a figure but said that i would receive a letter with the details in and to wait_until that arrived .
2	00th_november panel has arrived at last .
2	awaiting decision on any compensation that they are willing to allow for the stress , inconvenience , especially arranging to be in when they wanted to turn_up , and refurbished furniture , we should have insisted all damaged parts were replaced and if the door did not match then they would have had to replace all 0 doors !
2	orders arrived as promised and expected
2	great service thoroughly_recommend them .
2	the fitting was scheduled for friday but i wanted to be on the road early that day .
2	bc call_centre staff told me the tyre was due to be delivered to the fitting_centre thursday sometime and arranged that the fitter could do the job early if the tyre had arrived .
2	tyre was there thurs lunchtime and fitter offer to do the job as soon as i got to the fitting_centre .
2	coffee and magazines while i waited for the tyre to be fitted too - at tockwith mot centre nr wetherby .
2	great service and flexibility all_round .
2	have used them for a few_years_now , as the service , products and prices are excellent
2	just returned from a holiday in tenerife , booked with jet0 .
2	this was my first time travelling with them and i found it a pleasant_experience .
2	they keep you well - informed before your trip by regular e_- mails .
2	the on line checking in and choosing your seat are very helpful .
2	i was also impressed by the seat pitch as i am 0 ' 0 " and had ample room without upgrading to the seats with extra leg_room .
2	the baggage_allowance is also very generous at 00kg .
2	our flights left on time and the cabin_crew were very professional .
2	we were met by the jet0 rep at tenerife airport and shown to our coach .
2	there are no reps in the resort but you are provided with contact telephone_numbers .
2	two_days before departure a letter was delivered to our room detailing the coach pick - up time for transfer to the airport .
2	all - in - all a very pleasant travelling experience and one i would highly_recommend .
2	cannot recommend this company ’_s customer service highly_enough .
2	i purchased a sharp_microwave_oven from cheapelectricals a couple of weeks_ago .
2	on monday a part of the door catch snapped_off as i was closing it ( probably faulty – but nothing to do with cheapelectricals .)
2	i contacted sales_dept . by e_- mail on tuesday , they got back to me immediately saying that they would arrange for delivery of a new replacement oven the next_day and collect the damaged one .
2	i explained that i didn_’_t have the original_packaging – they replied that when the new one arrived i could use the packaging from it to return the damaged one , and they would arrange to collect it .
2	the new one arrived today as promised .
2	i have re - packaged the old one , informed , them , and they have arranged a collection for tomorrow .
2	what more could you ask for .
2	a special_mention for sam at cheapelectricals who kept me informed all the way .
2	the two tone picture mug arrive within a few_days , i had been expecting it in a few weeks !
2	the quality was great and at a very good price .
2	only one problem , i had used the wrong photo , my mistake .
2	so for all those out there thinking of using this company and product i would recommend them without_hesitation .
2	but check what your sending them several_times before you send it , they will print what you send them .
2	as expected , quick service and a product that works as_described .
2	will use this supplier again .
2	great products , great prices , great customer service .
2	excellent selection , good search_facility .
2	very good online checkout .
2	excellent delivery time .
2	excellent selection , price & service .
2	excellent communication and service , product as_described and good value for money .
2	very well priced .
2	excellent product . first_class service .
2	hello ,
2	i took my daugthers car in for a " half price full service " at the wolverton branch and found that the car had lots of " recommendations "
2	for example , the rear drum / shoe brakes needed cleaning and adjusting for £_00 which i thought should have been in the service - after all they would have already taken off the drum to " inspect " them as per service schedule - surely all the dust would have fallen out !
2	just requiring a quick squirt of cleaning_fluid ?
2	i also found that whoever dealt_with me was rather condescending - correcting me and treating me as if i knew absolutely nothing about cars .
2	i think that this half price offer draws you in and then they find all the faults they can - in fact i got a scare story about the radiator having lost all its fluid too !
2	when i asked further , i found out that it was " showing_signs of a leak "- which i have not seen at all - even today .
2	but they are still probably ok value - i guess you pay for what you get .
2	i ordered the suunto_d0i dive_computer .
2	best price i could_find by a long way .
2	when i ordered , i was contacted immediately to say there would be a slight_delay - not a problem for me .
2	in any case the delay turned_out to be two working_days - negligible .
2	i was kept_informed at every_step , the one person i spoke to was helpful and good humoured .
2	all in all this company is a pleasure to do_business with
2	never upgraded any computer device before and whilst my dell_laptop was in good working order , it was very slow .
2	had 0gb of memory installed when new and having_researched the diy aspects , decided to buy 0 matched x_0gb_memory_cards from mr_memory .
2	fast delivery ( first_class next_day at £ 0 . 00p ), useful_tips with the new cards , and worked first time .
2	got a much improved laptop for £_00 against a new laptop at £_000 !!
2	decided i might do the same for my desktop but my dell will only take 0gb max and with 0gb already installed , decided not worth it .
2	well_done mr_memory ..
2	i '_ll be back when next needed .
2	out of stock when i first looked , they notified me as requested when back in stock .
2	ordered , shipped and delivered quickly .
2	can '_t ask for more .
2	checked on a few sites and found tooled_- up to be the cheapest .
2	also offering free next_day delivery , the choice was obvious .
2	and then good communications about my order - receipt , despatch and then next_day delivery as promised .
2	ten out of ten tooled_- up .
2	only place i could what i wanted and dealt_with , dispatched and received super_fast .
2	totally recommended !!!!
2	!
2	great kindle cover , fantastic price and super service .
2	will_definitely use again .
2	great company to work with i was looking winter thres and alloy_wheels for my car after all the snow last_year , i would recommend this company to anyone , quick and professional service .
2	the meat received from our recent order was in one word
2	supercalifragilisticespialidocious !
2	great service , great vale and great taste - we will be returning to westin_gourmet and all it has to offer very soon .
2	would reccommend to anyone .
2	i placed the order between christmas and new year and it was still delivered the next_day .
2	really pleased with the excellent service .
2	just received some aaa eneloop batteries and am very pleased with the service and communication .
2	quick delivery and well_packed .
2	what a great help catherine was when the collection booking page flagged_up an issue and asked me to use " live help ".
2	catherine took all the relevant_information from me and processed it into an online order , sent me the link and all i had to do was agree to the ts_&_cs and pay .
2	our first time with jet0 and all aboard and ready for take of bang on time .
2	shortly_after taking my aisle seat , i noticed that the design of the seat was better_than those on most of the other holiday charters that we have been on , giving us those few precious centimeters of space and better still , the seats do not tilt , which is a major bone of contention with most of the well_known tour_operators .
2	it is not rocket_science to figure_out , that if the seat in front of you tilts , you have lost precious inches .
2	i have witnessed more than one heated exchange due to this ridiculous situation and my sympathy always lies with the person whose little piece of space , has just been invaded .
2	jet0 have not solved this problem , they have eliminated it and will be top of our shopping list for flights , for the future .
2	throw in pleasant and friendly cabin staff , clean aircraft and on time flight and i dont_know what else we could have asked for .
2	easy to use website .
2	friendly and courteous staff on phone .
2	all communications clear and easy to understand .
2	competitive_prices .
2	fast and reliable delivery of goods .
2	all exactly as it should be and how you would want an online business to to be .
2	robin seccombe , christchurch , dorset .
2	we wanted a replacement charcoal filter for our cooker_hood .
2	having found the make and model on the internet we found the best price was on your website so we ordered it .
2	delivery was promised within 0 days .
2	the product arrived on time and was exactly_what we expected .
2	great service thank_you
2	i was approached by a number of companies saying they could help me with my pension_annuity .
2	i selected age_partnership because they were the only company that followed up on their promises .
2	i found every member of staff that i dealt_with from the first phone_call to the last to be friendly and helpful .
2	good customer service is hard to come by these days but i was trully impressed by age_partnership .
2	well_done !
2	i would recommend you .
2	0000000
2	fabulous quality - better_than several other photo_books i have tried - really impressed !
2	my initial concerns about dealing_with simply_electronics were completely_unfounded - can '_t praise them high enough for a top_class service .
2	i have purchased many items on the internet over the years and this was probably the best experiance - would definately_use again and have no_hesitation in reccomending to others
2	ordered items , came next_day , no_problems
2	i could cut costs and run this company better if i was company director
2	what an embarrassing low quality service .
2	smashed screens were insured , but refused to compensate saying items not packed properly , had to sue them via court before they paid up before meeting the judge .
2	hundreds of unnecessary numbers for diff departments and they cant seem to put you through .
2	terrible pricing data spread over unintelligible sheets with unusual formatting , same with ridiculous invoices .
2	just a bad bad_experience , and i have used them regularly for a good few_years to know this .
2	i '_m off after yet another failed collection .
2	low brow sales .
2	talkative woman , the type to overtalk you .
2	i expressed a need to know more about the quote for a 0 camera system .. she took it as an indication i couldnt afford the system .
2	when i asked what the system recording make and model was she couldnt justify why she had quoted me that particular unit at all .. " its because its a good one " came the reply ...
2	so i asked , do you sell others ?
2	she replied yes , so i asked why offer me this unit ?
2	all i got was sales bluster and zero technical_knowledge .
2	the warranty they offered on parts was 0 year , yet the manufacturers_warranty on new product was 0 , upon querying she didnt know why that was .... selling refurbished product perhaps i suggested ... hmmm
2	poor service all_round .
2	sales simply not competent enough to listen and deliver the correct information .
2	why take the order if you feel you cannot deliver ?
2	i have had this problem twice with them .
2	i place the order and they dont have the item in stock so they will source it for you .
2	i was willing to wait , 0 week , then two_weeks .. was told it will arrive by a certain date when i queried .
2	still , no delivery but the usual update message " will be slightly_delayed with shipment till ..."
2	in 0000 it is unacceptable for a company in the channel to take money off a customer promise delivery and miss that schedule by 0_weeks .
2	surely you could have sourced that item in 0_weeks ?
2	oh_yes they could have , but they dont care to because clearly im not a priority .
2	or they cant source it below the price they offered it to me at .
2	will not use them again .
2	they had their chance .
2	they should never have taken my money or promised to supply it .
2	so we get their guy out to visit for an easy sale as mum needed blinds for her new apartment , and we were recommended the firm by the new building manager .. ( bad mistake ).
2	he comes in to measure up and price .. they then called me to take deposit and so we thought things were rolling .
2	0_weeks passes by , nothing .
2	another week passes by and nothing .. so i call to investigate and was advised that actually the blinds have not been ordered .
2	so i ask them why , only to be told that the person_who came out wasnt the right person to take the measurements ?
2	apparently he was only there to give a rough_estimate and that the proper measurements will need to be taken ?
2	incredulous at the incompetence and lack of willingness to be orderly i had to insist on cancelling the order and that my payment be returned immediately .
2	im speechless at such incompetence after they took a hefty_deposit and " ran " ater taking my money .
2	they promised a service , i engaged in that service and they absolutely delivered in timely_fashion with that service .
2	top_notch dudes .
2	when others were floundering with excuses .. theplasmacentre . com got the product delivered at the right time in an ultra - tight window with care and surgical precision ...
2	salute !
2	im easily pleased , but its shocking how so many other_companies mess up on the simple things ..
2	i know where to go if i need another solution they offer .
2	ps i work in it .. hopefully that informs you .
2	i had to call to understand the items were not in stock !!
2	that they were to be delivered next week , from 0rd_party who " had them in stock " but with no guarantee they wouldbe despatched today !
2	utter madness , purchase cancelled never again wasted 0 week for system upgrade .
2	beat all the other_providers on price and fitting service was first_class
2	so_far so good .
2	giving good service at a lower cost .
2	we have not had to use the service too often but when we have we have found it to be very efficient .
2	the best thing is that you are not left_hanging in a queue like the sage helpline .
2	i bought a zanussi fridge_freezer on behalf of my mother in law .
2	ordered on saturday_morning and delivered to aberdeenshire by monday_lunchtime .
2	i only used this company as a promo email came through .
2	i would not_hesitate to recommend them .
2	ordered a number of items from their sale department at great prices .
2	delivered after just 0 days - free delivery .
2	really great service and range for all keen_cyclists
2	i had not heard of this company before i purchased .
2	i bought 0 forgery detecting lamps .
2	the prices were competitve and i found the prices competitive .
2	i would recommend to everyone .
2	gc aberdeen
2	easy , quick to deal with and refunded an item that was my mistake .
2	first_class company and friendly staff
2	very quick response , light sent out and works great .
2	to get free delivery we got aqua fish_food which was overpriced but not disappointed .
2	thank_you
2	mark armit
2	if your thinking of getting_rid of your old_mobiles , look no further than mazuma .
2	my old_mobiles was sat in the kitchen draw , and every time i opened it i saw these old_phones just sat there collecting_dust , so when a pal of mine said he had just sold his to mazuma for a really good price and was so happy with the ease and simplicity of using mazuma '_s online forms i thought i ' d try it , so i did and have never looked back .
2	very very quick and efficient experience .
2	just go on mazuma '_s website and its all there for you to sell your old_mobile_phones .

2	many_thanks
2	it would be unfair of me to write anything as the deal didn_'_t go_ahead due to the high cost of postage to the channel_islands .
2	nobodies fault
2	ironically , it was cheaper , quicker and easier to get my thomas cooke vouchers from ' highstreetvouchers ' than direct from thomas cooke .
2	cheaper : thomas cooke was going to charge a £ 0 admin cost .
2	highstreetvouchers charged me the face value and gave a wallet free ,
2	quicker : thomas cooke three_days - highstreetvouchers two_days .
2	easier : highstreetvouchers web_site is a doddle to navigate whereas .....!!!
2	!
2	thank_you for a pleasant_experience .
2	would i recommend nightgear ?
2	yes i would .
2	i like a company which keeps you informed all the way .
2	i knew_exactly when my gear was dispatched and i knew when to expect my parcel and it worked .
2	every item i '_ve ordered so_far has_been in stock , at the right price and with a quick delivery .
2	you can '_t get much_better_than that .

2	i am an_avid sim pilot deperately seeking value for money custom system that could cope with fsx . my son had spent_thousands on a system which he found many faults with at all levels !
2	what to do !
2	over the years i had fortune to own and manage a succesful group of companies which relied on electronics and custom software . i spoke to my old it contractor whose genius allowed him to retire at an early age .
2	he said he had just seen small add and positive write up in pc pro about wired0fire and they were located near to my home . i went down to see them at work . years of experience in owning number of factories told me this could be the place . organised clean with great enthusiasm team spirit and vast knowledge of their subject .
2	i placed my first order , that cost one fifth of my sons system , faster with no water_cooling . the honesty , integrity , proffesionalism and back up support sent me back to buy my second system . my son is now a customer and guess_what the it genius who found them for me in the first place is also now a customer !
2	every day as i look at my four screens , gently touch the yoke , push on the rudder and set the autopilot and watch the smoothness of flight i truly thank my ground engineers known as wired0fire .
2	right from the start , this company kept us informed as to the progress of our order and even_though we opted for the free delivery rather_than next_day , our sandals still arrived the next_day .
2	we even received a time_slot within an_hour .
2	quality product as well .

2	regards ray
2	my wife enquired_about talk talks deal on their phone , internet and tv packages for her farther , the sales girl quoted free for the first three_months ( payment of line rental only ) and if they signed_up today the cost after 0 months would be £_00 . 00 including line rental and they would provide an engineer free of charge .
2	i thought this is a good deal and decided to contact them to enquire_about the same deal for ourselves .
2	the salesman seemed surprised when i explained the deal my wife was offered by
2	another sales_adviser , he was insistent that no such deal was available , i asked to speak to the manager and asked_him to listen to the recorded conversation , he firstly looked on their system and
2	informed me that my farther in laws details were on their system however no such deal had been recorded .
2	to make_matters_worse there was no apology , my conclusion was that this companies sales advisers cannot be trusted , so i decided not to pursue my interest further and told the manager to delete my
2	farther in laws details from their system and not to proceed with this enquiry .

2	excellent price , first_class delivery to the hour superb service

2	i ordered rw discs on a sat night received them the following_tuesday_morning , what more can you want , so until things change i can recommend inkubus to deliver

2	when sold eye cataract surgery was told i would not need glasses , my eyesight has_improved only slightly and i keep going back and complaining and just get fobbed_off with excusess the latest thing is giving me some glasses to wear .
2	on my last visit i was told i have too high an expectation £ 0000 for a slight improvement and still need glasses i dont_think so .
2	0 monthes since operation unlikely its going to improve .
2	regards
2	john_lewis
2	ps my sister angela lewis wants the operation what do you think i should say to her ?
2	update to this review
2	yesterday the 00th of may 0000 i had another appointment with a optomerist who said nothing can be done but he will make an appointment for me to see the surgeon who performed the operation he also said my eyesight had greatly_improved which is a lie these_people fob you off with excuses and try to make you believe your imagining things .
2	i put on my old specs and guess_what i could see perfect and without glasses i get ghosting i also get wicked dry_eye '_s i told this to the optomerist and he said thats just because he had been messing_around with my eye '_s .
2	i really wish i never had this done
2	fast delivery nice wheels and a good price but the £_00 . 00 pounds per_tyre service to have them fitted at a designated tyre_centre is a massive rip_off i went independant and was charged £ 0 . 00
2	if you need any tyres order them from tyreleader very good and cheap
2	i have used ryanair twice and on both_occasions i found the service to be unacceptable even for a bargain airline .
2	once i took my bike with me for which i paid twice as much as for my flight , but they treated me like i was some sort of parasite .
2	i got no help whatsoever , the desk person was extremely rude , i had to find the man to do the outsize check in and find out where to take the bike afterwards .
2	compare this to jet0 who are always welcoming and polite and make the experience easier .
2	it usually costs me about an extra £_00 - 00 pounds to use another airline - well_worth it .
2	i ordered goods 0_weeks_ago .
2	they have taken the money from my credit_card account but so_far i have received nothing .
2	not even an email to say what has happened .
2	website has no phone number to contact , email gets an auto response .
2	still hoping to get the goods , but not counting on it .
2	never use again .
2	will report to trading_standards if i don_'_t get something from them soon .
2	excellent service .
2	fast delivery of order , very well_packaged .
2	on 0 june i purchased 00 tickets from viagogo for a concert at somerset house on 00 july for a total_cost of £_000 . 00 .
2	not sure what the mark up on the face value was but probably substantial .
2	on 00 july ( ie the day before the concert ) " diego " from viagogo telephoned to apologise and say that they would not be able to supply me with the tickets .
2	huh_?
2	a huge disappointment and inconvenience for me and the 0 friends and work_colleagues i had invited to the concert .
2	please do not be_fooled_by viagogo '_s claim that they give a 000_% guarantee .
2	they do not guarantee that they will supply you with tickets .
2	only that they will try to get you tickets and if they fail to do so they may give you your money back .
2	eric baker you fat greedy fraud - one day you will pay the price for your crimes .
2	all my questions were answered_promptly and helped_me make the right choice in the equipment i needed .
2	prompt delivery .
2	i will be using them again and i recommend you use them .
2	wife was more than happy with the reading_specs that she ordered ............. of course they had to be ' pink frames ' by ' playboy '.
2	thanks to specky four eyes for reasonable prices , ( highlighting the rip - off of the high_street_opticians ).
2	i have recommended this company to all my colleagues , friends & relations & will_continue to use them myself .
2	have everything and delivered really rapidly
2	numbergroup '_s t &_cs say that " at_least thirty ( 00 ) days notice will be given prior to suspension for non - payment " but in my case they cut_off my business lines on february_00th after one ( 0 ) days notice for a bill that had been due for payment ( they allege ) within 00 days of february 0st ( previous invoices had allowed 00 days to pay ).
2	does that look like 00 days notice prior to suspension to anyone ?
2	the functionality of the web_site is good , but the customer service ( and the abilty to add up !)
2	are from the dark_ages .
2	in this day and age , its great to deal with a company that treats you with respect , red_hot service , red_hot value , red_hot sunglasses " the dogs_bollocks "
2	this website is easy to navigate and gives travellers views on all_aspects and from all ages .
2	i never travel without_consulting them however it '_s shame more people don_'_t leave reviews on the lesser resort hotels .
2	recently travelled economy to dubrovnik in croatia and whilst the flights were bang on time both_ways , the stewards and the food were not .
2	early flights meant miserable cabin staff , the return in the afternoon was like being with a different airline .
2	mediocre meal going out and just a sandwich on the return .
2	glad i '_m going with croatia airlines next time as their flights are consistently good .
2	sorry ba despite your recent pr exercise on sky in truth it '_s still not what you expect from britain '_s premier airline .
2	ok even with a satnav off the m00 it '_s a bit hard to find when at a junction you ' re told you '_ve arrived but a quick glance to the left finds airparks , perhaps they could put a sign before the junction advising a left turn !
2	the whole_process from booking in , when we_boarded a bus immediately to the return when we had a 00 minute wait , went like_clockwork .
2	returning the car was easy to find and the staff were courteous and happy .
2	will_definitely use again and recommend anyone to airparks
2	i ordered the wrong_size drysuit which was at the best price i could_find , it also came with a free under suite .
2	i had new suite the next_day and confirmation of a refund on the same day the original suite was delivered back to wetsuitoutlet .
2	wonderful service , very helpful staff , great prices .
2	thanks you .
2	nick
2	hey i just ordered some muscle_milk on special this week , the chocolate_mint chip and the german chocolate cake .
2	the last 0 i ordered were vanilla creme and chocolate .
2	i can '_t seem to keep enough of it at home .
2	i love the shake texture and flavors and the energy they give me .
2	i add fruit and or pumpkin seed ground .
2	you can '_t beat it for a nutritious , delicious energy bursting drink .
2	i sent a package from the uk to northern thailand which was delivered in 0 days - fantastic relaible service from_start to finish
2	richard sindall england .
2	i ordered self_assembly guest beds .
2	goods delivered ok
2	when unpacked 0 item missing
2	when constructing found that 0 piece had been incorrectly drilled and was unable to continue .
2	called customer_services held on for 00_minutes , finally hang up without and answer at the cost of £ 0 : 00 .
2	e_mailed customer_services explaining the position and asked them to call me back .
2	they sent me an e_mail_stating that their spares team will contact me within 00_hours but i '_m not at all confident that this will happen , i '_m_sure that i will be calling them .
2	i find that the product is of poor quality and their customer_services are very inefficient compared to other on line companies .
2	i suggest that argos follow the example of other on line companies e . g .
2	pine_solutions , appliances on lines and , bath store for proactive customer_services and efficiency .
2	goods arrived on the requested day ( paid for express delivery )
2	the packaging of the goods was really belt and braces ; no way were these going to get damaged .
2	all components were there .
2	the instructions were clear and straight_forward
2	the furniture was a dream to build .
2	the quality is much more than i expected .
2	we now have a solid dressing_table , my wife is very pleased .
2	just one negative_comment there was a slight brown stain on the stool .
2	but this doesn_'_t detract_from the 0_star_rating .
2	this is the standard that all suppliers of self_assembly furniture should use as a template .
2	we '_ll certainly make pine_solutions our first_port of call for any further self_assembly furniture requirements .
2	booked car for our trip to be collected at cape_town airport , collected car & drove to hotel .
2	next time we used car was to go into cape_town & that '_s when problem_arose .
2	we completed our business & went back to car which would not start at all .
2	phoned dollar / thrifty to report problem , they came back & said they ' re sending replacement car .
2	the replacement car took more than an_hour to get to us , we had to pay extra for parking & when car arrived the tank was not full as they had driven from the airport to cape_town , speedo reading showed more than 00kms driven .
2	returned car on the due date with a full_tank of petrol .
2	car checked & agreed that there would be no further charges for us .
2	on checking credit_card statement we now find that an additional_fee of r000 . 00 for petrol has_been charged .
2	i have registered a dispute with my bank & now wait for outcome .

2	a super item , exactly as_described and delivered very quickly .
2	one of the best article resources on the internet .
2	they are informative , well written and you can use them on your own website – for free .
2	great web directory if you want to promote your website .
2	they publish your submission considerably fast for a free service .
2	recommended .
2	if you need a good domain reseller , it '_s definitely enom .
2	their prices are cheap , and in my opinion they are much_better_than godaddy .
2	definitely the best hosting company out there .
2	they occasionally have some server loading issues , but their support_team is amazing , by far better_than everyone_else .
2	awesome place for true whiskey connoisseurs !
2	the prices are far from cheap , but nobody expects them to be for the quality brands they offer .
2	ordered tuesday , arrived wednesday .
2	will_definitely recommend and use again .
2	excellent service would recomend .
2	mr . ben raw my advisor was very helpfull and outstanding in the way he dealt_with me
2	although i didn_'_t buy a piano from uk_pianos , i was very impressed by graham_howard '_s full and impartial_advice and his frequent free updates and guides .
2	impossible to fault this company .
2	i rang them on tuesday_afternoon , ordered next_day delivery and instantly received text and email confirmation .
2	early the next_day i got a four - hour delivery window , then mid - morning a one - hour_window , followed_by a call from the driver saying he ' d be there in 00_minutes .
2	why can '_t every firm be this customer - friendly and make great use of technology to benefit the customer ?
2	keep_up the great service !
2	bought two_sets of decals one set was fine , the other were clearly ancient stock , with a white residue on the printing and signs of water_damage .
2	emailed hannants requesting return and refund , and was completely_ignored .
2	after a couple of email '_s i gave up and reclaimed the money through paypal .
2	they ignored paypal too , so ( eventually ) i got the refund under paypal '_s default system .
2	clearly these_people are happy to send out rubbish and ignore any complaints in the hope that people will give up .
2	i certainly won_'_t use them again .
2	i advise you not to as well , and i have forwarded all the emails to their local tso for their consideration
2	this company have wrecked my home .
2	had windows fitted in february , they turned_up and put lots of dust sheets down which i thought was good .
2	what i found afterwards was they shook them out in the rooms we had crap everywhere .
2	the fitter then ask us to sing some paper_work tell us that it was the delivery note for the windows that needed signing on 0 form as there was no carbon copy 0 form was placed over the first with just the signature line showing .
2	what we signed was a satisfaction form to say we were satisfied with the job .
2	at this point we had not looked at any widows other than the one in the kitchen where we were stood this looked good from the inside and the fitter told us he would be back the next_day to finish of around windows with some trim which he did not have on van .
2	at this point it was starting to get dark so we thanks and off he went .
2	this is when we found all the crap spread over the rest of the house along with mastic spread all over the frames and window revels .
2	it took me and my wife nearly 0 hours to clean up .
2	the next_day we looked outside what a " f_*** ing mess .
2	there was mastic all over the bricks around windows it looked like he had removed the nozzle from the gun and spread it around with a trowel .
2	we are now trying to get it resolved they have so_far sent 0 different fitter '_s around but neither of them were prepared to try and put this right in the time they had .
2	after sending a email to the ceo and sending copies of complaints letters to them via_recorded delivery we had a visit from a manager , who has agreed to replace 0 window with a new one take out another one and refit correctly and clean off some of the mastic .
2	we have a date for this for 00 may , 0 months after the first installation .
2	will up date this after this date .
2	ordered items on line over bank_holiday_weekend , 00 . 00 tuesday_morning i received a call to tell me the items were not available .
2	this gave_me time to find alternative .
2	would use them again when i need anything_else .
2	would recommend , really good quality mattress and much less_than high_street_shops .
2	posted to mazuma on a friday and money in bank by monday_afternoon at exactly price offered .
2	first_class service : )
2	sent my blackberry after they quoted £_00 . 00 on website , emailed me back with revised_offer of £_00 . 00 due to excessive_wear & tear ( it was in perfect_condition ).
2	had to pay £ 0 . 00 to get my phone back , then sent to mazuma who paid £_00 . 00 same day they got it .
2	my advice don_'_t go near !!!!
2	!
2	i needed a washing_machine as the old bosch fell on its feet . with 0 kids we need something pretty urgent and buywise sorted us out .
2	once we knew_exactly_what we needed , we had it delivered and connected up within the day .
2	you can '_t beat that for service !
2	excellent .
2	sent iphone and payment and then heard_nothing for the best part of 0_weeks .
2	no replies to my phone_calls or emails , of which i made or sent many .
2	phone came back today ( not repaired ) via_royal_mail - thank_you for that .
2	no work completed but payment still processed by rotten_apples .
2	now taking steps through trading_standards to report the fraud and claiming via credit_card company .
2	please beware .
2	three_weeks before moving_house i emailed fu ( perfectly named ) to advise them that i would be sending them a final reading .
2	on the due date i did this but heard_nothing .
2	eight emails and three phone_calls later they have still not managed to send a final_bill , let_alone credit me with £_000 that they owe me .
2	i have of course received an estimated bill reducing my credit by £_00 for a month i have not lived in the house .
2	i am so frustrated by their useless customer service who cannot deal with the problem or send any kind of specific reply to emails .
2	i can see that i shall have to sue them for the credit as they clearly have no_intention of accepting the fact that i have moved_house nor that i am owed money .
2	do not get involved with company - they are thieves and should not be allowed to remain in business .
2	after 0_weeks has elapsed from the beginning of your complaint , you should contact ofgem with all available evidence .
2	it is unlikely that they will do anything being useless too , but at_least it logs into the statistical volume of complaints about these rogue companies .
2	we found the product that we wanted on the website and the ordering_process was simple .
2	the rail arrived within the timeframe_specified
2	we ordered a leather_sofas which was delivered on time .
2	sadly one of the delivery men managed to smash a picture on the wall .
2	he promised that laura_ashley would pay for it and took photos as evidence .
2	00 days_later a claim_form arrived asking for two repair estimates which we sent immediately .
2	after several phone_calls , they claimed that they never received the form and asked for a copy which was sent recorded delivery .
2	however despite another letter promising to pay followed_by five phone_calls to customer service and more recorded delivery letters , we cannot obtain a reply .
2	it is now 0 months since delivery .
2	i guess a solicitors letter is now the next option and / or a claim through the small_claims court .
2	also it is time that watchdog took a serious look at the appalling stories .
2	i have always found trip_adviser extremely useful when picking a destination and hotel .
2	the reviews are genuine and written by fellow_travellers which means the important things are mentioned , the little details that make all the difference when choosing a hotel .
2	i have never been disappointed after using trip_adviser and would recommend that you always check the reviews before booking anything .
2	i say an email with a sale and having been looking for this drill / driver for months immediately knew it was a brilliant deal so ordered it .
2	arrived 0 days_later and is exactly_what i expected .
2	the website was easy to navigate with clear_descriptions of the products which made it easy to choose .
2	needed a decent new set of 0x0 tyres but didn_'_t want to waste time and effort finding them nor did i want to pay over the odds - solution : black_circles . com !

2	i bought a roofbox package with whispbars and kamei delphin box to suit my vw_touareg .

2	box and bars perfect for the job !
2	will be needing a bike_rack as soon as my towbar is fitted and i know there is no point looking anywhere_else for it .
2	these_guys are the best .
2	we hired a 0_seater from cabrera_medina for a week in lanzarote .
2	pick - up in arecife was really quick and easy and there were no extra_charges on top of the quoted price at the time of reservation .
2	car was basic but fine - it was a 0_seater van so didn_'_t expect any more than we got .
2	location for pick_up and return are really convenient in arecife but are probably similar for the other_companies .
2	overall a good experience and we will probably use cabrera_medina next time we visit .
2	the boot_liner is extremely well made and fits_perfectly .
2	my boot is a complicated shape with cubby holes etc but the liner fits into all these spaces .
2	delivered quickly and well_packaged .
2	rubber floor mat a little expensive but excellent quality - it '_s going to last and last .
2	will use hatchbag again when i replace my vehicle .
2	i ordered my caninsulin , i scanned my prescription 0 days_later .
2	the very same day i received an email from viovet to say they had received email and would dispatch my prescription the next_day , thinking i would not receive it until the following week , because the weekend was only 0 days away , and they don_'_t deliver insulin on a weekend , viovet kept me informed of my delivery and the next_day i had email to say it would be delivered the next_day , on the day of the delivery another reminder was sent to say when it would be delivered then prior to delivery they sent me a window of when it would arrive .
2	they were spot on , then another email was sent to say it had been delivered and what to do if i wasn_'_t happy with the delivery .
2	absolutely superb service .
2	thank_you viovet .
2	i stayed in best_western in chicago and it was awful .
2	i complained to corporate headquarters and they were worse than useless
2	they kept handing it back to the hotel to deal with , if they are corporate hq the deal with complaints
2	so be warned if you complain you will get bumped around from pillart to post !
2	!
2	they did go downhill for a long time , now on their way back up , but still expensive
2	cal themselves cheap ?
2	?
2	yeah till you see all the extras you get charged for !
2	!
2	food , luggage etc ..
2	do not fly ryan_air , if you do it '_ll cost you more than with ba or any other company !
2	!
2	every time i go to tesco their prices go up , what happened to this new scheme on prices they are advertising , or is that just in larger stores ?
2	?
2	sell it to somebody who really wants it , after you no_longer need it !
2	!
2	everybody uses social_media now , its becoming boring , especially when you don_'_t know half the people that connect with you !
2	!
2	be careful , be very careful .
2	it has it uses but it has its down sides also
2	you need any info on any film or release or actor / actress etc .
2	its all here at your_fingertips !
2	!
2	enjoy searching through everything about movies
2	be warned that your account can become limited by paypal at their discretion then when they want more info to lift the limitation it can get very irritable when they keep wanting more and more although you provide what they want
2	be warned , paypal is never as easy as they say it is !
2	!.
2	amazon is simple to use , and easier to pay .
2	fantastic website with just about anything you would want to purchase , and can send worldwide by adding in different shipping addresses to your account .

2	i highly_recommend mazuma moblie to anybody that has old_mobile_phones to get_rid off .
2	received a text and e_- mail at 00 . 00 saying it would be delivered between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 .
2	so the parcel arrived at about 00 . 00 !
2	driver knew nothing about the timings .
2	can '_t see why they give a time_slot if it '_s purely fictional .
2	just annoys the customer !
2	i haven_'_t sent flowers for a long time , ever_since the " traditional " firm told me that the fact that it had never_heard of alnwick ( probably the best known town in northumberland ) was the reason it hadn_'_t bothered to deliver my flowers - or even to tell me that it hadn_'_t bothered !
2	serenata sent me blow by blow updates , and the recipient was most grateful .
2	thank_you !
2	lowest_prices .
2	easy website
2	i placed this order for a special bouquet of flowers for my mother in law for mother '_s day .
2	the flowers should have been delivered on either saturday or sunday , as specified when choosing the option " mothers_day weekend ".
2	unfortunately , i discovered on the following_monday , that nothing had been delivered .
2	i immediately contacted iflorist and spoke to a customer_services rep , who could provide no explanation , no satisfactory solution to the problem .
2	the date for delivery had apparently been set for several_years previously , and the rep implied that the error must have been caused_by user fault with my laptop date being incorrect .
2	i looked into the date issue and it is not possible to choose any date other than in the future .
2	the rep seemed clueless and so i insisted on speaking to the customer_services manager .
2	i was told the manager was not at work , so i asked for someone senior to contact me back within an_hour .
2	0 hours_later , i telephoned again - nobody senior available yet again - i was promised that someone would call back that same day ,
2	an_hour later , calls were being directed to an answermachine message and no online_chat_facility was available either .
2	i am beyond exasperated with iflorist .
2	i have been completely_ignored , accused of lying , error making , disbelieved , lied to , fobbed_off and iflorist have totally failed to adhere to their contract , accept any responsibility for the blunder and have made no attempt to apologise .
2	i have only today received a full_refund - weeks after the company failed to deliver the flowers .
2	needless to say , i shall not be using your company again and will be ensuring family and friends are aware of my experience .
2	spoke sammie_taylor was very helpful positive and friendly booked my parcel for me took precise details and helped_me out a jam

2	ordered a snagging knife and it was supplied quickly and hassle_free .
2	will use this site again
2	as previously , the order was delivered very speedily and i know that the heavy_duty mountaineer socks and icebreaker 000 vest will perform better_than anything on the market .
2	the site was clear and simple to navigate , the ordering was secure and delivery was prompt .
2	the whole_experience was was straightforward and quick .
2	a pleasure to deal with .
2	they were competitive , personal were well_versed and knowledgable .
2	i dealt_with iain and karan and their customer service was exemplary .
2	i shall_certainly be contacting multizone for my next purchase
2	use many_times for online selling quick and easy parcels deliveedr quicker_than 0 days
2	it would be good if collecrtplus offered a parcel rate for under 0kg and also done home and business collections for people send a large number of parcels at one time lot cheaper_than post_office .
2	i was hesitant at first , but then i read all the positive_reviews on facebook .
2	after i received my notice that my iphone_unlock_code had been generated , i hooked up my phone via usb to my computer and opened itunes .
2	the unlock process took a few_seconds and i was set .
2	awesome service !

2	flights with easyjet are exactly as advertised .
2	they will get you where you want to go , no_frills unless you want to pay extra .
2	ideal for budget - conscious travellers , but don_'_t use them if you are one of life '_s moaners and complainers .
2	i found the services i paid for were perfectly_adequate for my needs , the staff helpful and polite .
2	i never get any_problems with o0 .
2	always manage to get a signal , no delays sending messages , no_problems with billing .
2	always get excellent service with polite and knowledgeable_staff at call_centre .
2	i have found gjw_titmuss '_s prices to be consistently cheaper_than local_supermarket or pet_supermarket prices for supplies for our 0 cats plus occasional visitors !
2	also useful for some of my fishing baits , too , and with free delivery options_available i am saving even more money on fuel for the family car .
2	very good company .

2	mattress is very nice , came well_packed and really noticed the difference the first night i slept on it .
2	thank_you
2	the service is second to none with the product being very well_packaged at a competitive price .
2	i was a bit_sceptical_about purchasing a pre_- owned tag_heuer watch but was amazed at the superb quality of the watch , the fantastic price and the matchless service from wf_& co , especially alex stonely .
2	i would totally recommend watchfinder if you ' re looking for a superb timepiece at an unbeatable price .
2	it is now my first_port of call for quality watches .
2	they say they '_ve been when they havn '_t
2	they say they will deliver and they won_'_t
2	they promise the earth but won_'_t deliver

2	i '_ve read bad_reports about poor service from delivery companies before , the likes of yodel and parcel farce , but these really take the micky , if you do use them and they let you down i told you so !
2	superb service would recoomend them and will_certainly use them again

2	!
2	all i did was go on website for two mins , mazuma did the rest . dead easy !
2	!
2	write why you did not find the experience particularly good .
2	for instance_:
2	i finally received my item but after a lot of correspondence back and forth .
2	the company obviously did not have the item in stock and would return the money to me .
2	the item is ok .
2	write why you found the experience excellent .
2	for instance_:
2	the item arrived the day after i ordered it !
2	the customer service was very helpful and i got all the information that i needed .
2	i can only recommend this company to others .
2	excellent service and fast delivery .

2	city_link recently lost a consignment of ours worth over £ 0000 and when we claimed for our losses they quoted their t '_s &_c '_s and paid us a paltry_£_000 in compensation .
2	last_week a requested before 0 . 00 am delivery to our customer only left their depot at 0 . 00 am .
2	today they were supposed deliver to a manchester city_centre office block and when the package didn_'_t arrive on time they said that they " had left next door ".
2	lazy drivers , non_existent account_managers and an impregnable phone system that can keep you on hold for up to an_hour .
2	total rubbish .
2	avoid at all cost .
2	i phoned sds for advice which they gave_me over the phone they were very helpful and delivered everything on time as promised .
2	thank_you .
2	we were totally_satisfied with the service and the delivery was on time as promised , we were also very surprised with the quality of the product , we most definitely would recommend this company .

2	i needed a new laser_printer quickly .
2	i reveiwed printerlands website , which was easy to navigate , assess the printers and the cost of consumables , which is important for a small business .
2	having made my choice the ordering_process was easy and the printer was delivered the next_day without_any_problems .
2	i will be using printerland again .
2	exactly as promised , fill in on - line form , pack received in mail next_day .
2	post the phone and battery back to them on the monday and by the friday , money in my account .
2	much_better_than recycling or binning the phone .
2	second time i '_ve dealt_with mazuma , quick service always .
2	i '_ve_used black_circles 0 or 0 times now and everything always runs_smoothly .
2	on this occasion i had to call to re - arrange my fitting time , no problem at all .
2	i like the tyre rating information that the site gives about individual makes of tyre .
2	the tyre prices are the most competitive i '_ve been able to find .
2	oponeo was recommended by a friend , i have a ' 00 plate mercedes_c class which came with a ' pram wheel ' as a spare_wheel and tyre and because i regularly travel the motorways i had to find a proper spare_wheel but didn_'_t want another alloy_wheel , oponeo came up with a choice of three different branded steel_wheels , i bought the cheapest at £_00 delivered to the door . the website was very easy to use as well , just put the the index number make and model and the choices appeared .
2	i had never_heard of the carshop and discovered them whilst_browsing for a used mercedes_c class online .
2	i had already gone to view a number of cars at different sellers and been disappointed with the condition of the cars .
2	i saw a car i liked on the carshop website and phoned to enquire_about it , during the course of the conversation it became_apparent to me that i had most probably found the place i was going to buy my car from , not only was the person on the end of the phone courteous , polite and knowledgeable he was not pushy , there was no attempt at pressuring me to buy .
2	when i visited the showroom the service was perfect , i bought my car which was immaculately_presented .
2	the process was professional and completed faultlessly .
2	i also know that i could not have bought a better mercedes_c class than the one i bought from carshop and nor could i have got one at a better price .
2	i have no_reservations at all in recommending the carshop cardiff .
2	my yale front_door with keyless entry is a beautifully manufactured piece of kit .
2	i chose a green door with double glass_panels on the top half .
2	i bought it to replace a 00 years plus old upvc door which at the time i thought was a decent door , but up against the yale_door there is no comparison , the yale beats it on all fronts , security , design , decoration , and most positively on quality it '_s in a different class .
2	dealing_with yale as a company was a pleasure and i cannot recommend them highly_enough .
2	i use chemist_direct every year for my hay_fever relief tablets .
2	year on year they provide the cheapest generic products .
2	delivery is swift never taking more than 0 days from date of order .
2	i '_m loosing count of how many_times i '_ve bought from the company now it '_s either 0 or 0 times and the price and delivery can '_t be_beaten .
2	top name battery for less_than i would have paid to h ***** d '_s even when you add in the delivery cost .
2	my first time with an excide and it has made a noticable difference and even the finish and covers speak quality .
2	very prompt and reliable service with update , s on delivery times
2	good stuff best prices .
2	shipping could be lower
2	i visit edinburgh often & have stayed in many hostels & hotels there .
2	this is the best place to stay in the city & that includes £_000 a night hotels .
2	much_better value for money here .
2	staff are friendly & really nice .
2	hostel is clean & now have bar area which serves good cheap food .
2	the only_negative_aspect is that one of the showers on the 0nd floor takes a long time for the water to heat up , but there are enough other showers to use instead .
2	on a whole budget backpackers can '_t be_beaten .
2	brought a pair of jeans on line & collected in my local_store .
2	cannot_fault them at all .
2	was advised when ready for collection but had to ask where collection_point was in store .
2	the young_lady walked me over & collected with out any_problems .
2	would recommend service .
2	avoid at all costs .
2	they cancelled my direct debt which they said was due to technical problems did not advise of any_problems until getting a letter asking for payment .
2	resolved problem by making due payment but was still chased by their debt_collectors for payment which had already been made and whose non payment was the fault of talk_talk .
2	frankly they are then worse firm i have ever_dealt_with , cannot be trusted and would advise any body not to touch these with a barge_pole .
2	brought a pair of trainers was a bit_skeptical_about using them , but pleasantly_surprised .
2	good product at a fraction of the price in a shop , quick delivery - no_problems what so ever .
2	would us again to buy anything_else .
2	been using these for about a couple of years .
2	only once had a problem which was rectified without_any difficulty .
2	overall cannot_fault them .
2	cheap but good products which apart_from that one time have always been delivered quickly without_any_problems .
2	having a small second pension about to mature and having read that the best annuity_rates are not always given by the original provider , i went_onto a price comparison site to get an idea of available rates .
2	as a result , i was contacted by sam from key_retirement solutions , who was able to explain the alternatives , and tax implications .
2	sam was very pleasant and incredibly efficient , providing the relevant forms , and backing them up with phone_calls to explain all the details .
2	after about 0_weeks i received my tax free lump_sum and first annuity payment from my new provider which was more than 00_% higher_than my original providers quote .
2	a significant gain , and no charges paid by me .
2	purchase supplied within time frame and as per the quality expected
2	ordered a pair of alpinestars joey waterproof shoe tarmac in suede , unfortunately shiny leather arrived .
2	they are ok but given the cost to return and the associated hassle i am better off keeping them , especially when they can '_t even be_bothered to reply to my email .
2	no way would i use this company again
2	a very thick cast_iron manhole !!
2	it was before parcel0go and insurance we '_ll see - not much hope .
2	items ordered are sent promptly and queies dealt_with in a speedy and friendly_manner .
2	the item was sent very quickly and the company was prompt to answer my query when the delivery was delayed_due to the riots causing some problems for the carriers .
2	very friendly company - would highly_recommend them .
2	you find what you want , you are shown the price , you select .
2	no_hidden nonsense , no problem .
2	i tried for months to get someone to collect a 00kg van roof_rack from the midlands and deliver to a fairly remote address in the scottish_borders .
2	then i found postagesupermarket . com and having placed the order just before 0pm , the rack was uplifted the following afternoon and delivered mid_morning the next_day .
2	collected by tnt , delivered by stuart park haulage of kelso and managed by postagesupermarket . com .
2	brilliant teamwork delivering superb service .
2	thank_you !
2	buying batteries can be risky if you ' re looking for a reasonable shelf_life .
2	i was very pleasantly_surprised to receive a batch of button_cells that have an expiry_date 0 years longer_than the picture on the web_page .
2	thanks very much buyabattery , much_appreciated .
2	i had particulat requirements , gave them to much_better adventures and they quickly came back with some good options .
2	i would recommend them .
2	easy to book , good instructions , good value .
2	web_site was clear and simple , ordering straightforward .
2	selections took payment 00 days before delivery , and took 00 days to despatch with no notification of delay .
2	so i have been financing their business and my apples have been rotting whilst awaiting delivery of the storage_unit .
2	if i could rate with no stars , i would .
2	i have used viovet for a number of years_now and have always been impressed with their service and value .

2	order no .

2	a simple process of putting the mobile details in , personal details and then paying .

2	thanks currency_club !!
2	!
2	goods as_described & do what it says on the tin !
2	i have been with 0uhosting for nearly 00 years .
2	i moved to them because of unsatisfactory service from another , larger hosting company , and it was the best decision i have ever made .
2	the service is reliable and reasonably_priced and any_queries i have are easily logged and the response is always quick , friendly and helpful .
2	they knock the socks off many larger and more well - known hosting_companies , and i would recommend anyone_thinking of using a hosting company to use 0uhosting .
2	the web_site was easy to use and the order went through quickly .
2	i would therefore use this service again in the future .
2	placed an order at about 00 . 00am on a tuesday and received an e_- mail at about 0 . 00pm the same afternoon saying my order had been shipped .
2	it arrived the next_day about lunch time .
2	the order was complete and the item was as advertised .
2	that '_s great service .
2	having spent time searching on line for this particular item , the price was competitive too .
2	having looked on the internet for an electric_guitar i came_across the gear0music website .
2	i found the guitar i wanted and the next_morning i phoned them to arrange for it to be in their showroom .
2	i drove from leicester to york ( 000_miles ) and eventually found the shop , ( sat_nav not quite right , it '_s left at the second roundabout when you get onto great north way ).
2	my mother and i were both greeted with a friendly smile and a nice cup of tea , can '_t ask better_than that .
2	after much running about back and forth to the stock room i eventually had all the stuff i had come for .
2	great service guy '_s ( and girls ), thanks for the brew , the guitar '_s great .

2	i was looking to use parcel_force , but it was so expensive i surfed the net for an_alternative carrier and found interparcel .
2	when i saw how cheaper it was i was a bit_sceptical , but decided to use them .
2	good move .
2	esay to place order .
2	arrived on time for pick - up and delivered when they said it would be .
2	i would certainly recommend interparcel .
2	my item was delivered damaged and they bent_over_backwards to sort_out the problem well_done
2	quick delivery .
2	helpful advice .
2	lovely quality print .
2	we are restoring our 0000 queen anne .
2	the radiators had seen better days , so i tried to find restored originals .
2	it was very difficult .
2	then i gave castrads a call .
2	they provided the perfect sizes , styles , and colors to make the job a snap !
2	manufactured , finished and shipped to my door in newport ri usa in three_weeks .
2	unbelievable !!
2	we love restoring magnificent old houses , i will use only castrads for all our future cast_iron radiator needs .
2	they made finding the " right " radiators efficient and pleasurable .
2	what a fantastic resource .

2	we all make_mistakes and i made a mistake by sending an unedited print to pixum for printing .
2	the two photos i had on my desktop were similar and it was my fault that i clicked on the unedited one for sending .
2	i noticed it immediately after i sent it and quickly emailed them to tell them of my mistake .
2	i got an email back the next_day to say once you send the order it cannot be cancelled .
2	i would imagine local trading_standards would have something to say about that .
2	fortunately , it was only 00 pence but it could have been a more_expensive canvas etc .
2	therefore beware , make 000_% sure you send the correct images or you will still be charged .
2	apart_from that the quality of the product is very good
2	i bought a 0 corals and a conch from charterhouse_aquatics and to say i am impressed would be an_understatement .
2	i asked them to mark each bag with the coral name as i was splitting them with my son and sure_enough each bag was clearly_identified .
2	the size of the corals were larger than_expected and well bagged and protected with heat packs etc .
2	comes with a set of climatisation instructions for those who are new to this and these are well_laid_out and easy to follow .
2	having bought corals from other_companies i have to say charterhouse_aquatics towers above them all .
2	all of the corals were open within 00_minutes of being placed in the aquarium
2	the above caption says it all really .
2	i found the browsing of the website so easy and very well_laid_out without too much clutter .
2	finding the product i wanted was a breeze on mobilefun and the quality of the service was just first_class .
2	i was kept well informed of when the item would be dispatched and equally when it was dispatched .
2	for an item to arrive next_day using first_class post is just brilliant although i do understand it is out of the company '_s hands once the courier gets hold of it .
2	i ordered around 0pm and my item arrived next_morning .
2	this company not only look professional , they are professional and i would recommend them to anyone and in fact have already done so .
2	its a fact of life that mistakes can and will be made no matter_how good a company is however i think i would rather it happened with a company i could trust who will undoubtedly sort it out in a timely_manner .
2	use mobilefun , you wont_regret it
2	i sent my mobile saturday_afternoon and i was astonished to find payment was in my account by monday_afternoon .
2	i wish all companies_operated like this maybe then this country would be a better place .
2	other_companies take_note and learn something .
2	this has to be the poorest delivery company to grace this planet .
2	i ordered an item on 00th_december and got an email to say it would be delivered to me on the 00th_december .
2	i checked the tracking on the 00th and it had not even reached their delivery depot which was only 00 miles from their hub .
2	i live 00 miles from the company who sent me the item .
2	i called dpd and they said it would not be delivered until tuesday 0rd_jan no reason given .
2	tuesday came and went with still no delivery , ok it was stormy that day so i could forgive them for that as many of the bridges were closed .
2	however , no information sent to me whatsoever about the delivery it finally arrived wednesday at 0 : 00 pm .
2	is it no wonder this country is going down the pan when we have to deal with incompetent companies like that .
2	god help us .
2	whatever you do dont use this lot
2	excellent service very speedy results with a query on a return_journey ticket i had purchased
2	always good quality at great price and always with quick delivery
2	great stuff
2	a very easy pain_free booking and easy to navigate around site
2	made an order online for a 0 gang socket and an intermediate light_switch ( i do need others but this was a trial purchase ) these arrived very quickly and the quality was excellent .
2	i will_definitely be buying the others from the internet electrical store .
2	i have just returned from a 0 day cruise in western med with a cruise voucher .
2	it was a great cruise and very relaxing with loads to do if you wanted too .
2	i would like to thank richard lester from cruise voucher very much for his help and making it possible .
2	i would highly_recommend these vouchers to anyone .
2	thanks again richard .
2	mazuma have a great service , really efficient and straight_forward to understand .
2	would recommend them to all of my colleagues and friends .
2	hassle_free no long_waits comfortable plane with lots of room and pleasent staff
2	ordered these bulbs based on lumen value as i wanted genuine replacement for incandescent 00 w . arrived when promised fitted no prob .
2	deliver promised amount of light ( unlike many others ).
2	emailed and checked that the replacement cd_player i was ordering was a straight swap / fix .
2	assured it was so purchased .
2	first prob .
2	came when car audio insisted it was dispatched but heg parcel co . insisted it was not .
2	car audi ignored emails , unavailable on phone .
2	eventually got through by phone , told not despatched as awaiting final parts - why then email me saying it was with a tracking no ?
2	finally arrived , problem it is compatible but in order to use it needs a ( large dia ) cable running from boot to console as uses non vehicle std din connections cannot not use existing cable .
2	to be fair spoke to car audio fitters ( none local ) who very helpful , said its not that difficult , again a but , am still trying to get sensible quote from local_fitters for doing it , they all say it is a big job .
2	being disabled i have long used an electric spray_gun to refresh the oil in / on my garden_furniture rather_than a brush ( to painful ).
2	i therefore tend to use quite a lot .
2	horrified by the price of " teak oil " locally i searched on line .
2	i will admit i was a bit_dubious that this company could sell and deliver 0 litres for circa a third of the local price but decided to chance it .
2	product duly delivered as promised , brand_name , worked like a dream .
2	i am a very happy customer .
2	having seen a mates recently_bought drill / driver set i went looking on the web for the same kit .
2	when it came up at £_000 on mymatemark i was convinced that there must be a catch , my friend having paid nearly_double on a trade only site .
2	imagine my amazement when the tools turned_up , absolutely perfect and with a free set of safety glasses .
2	i recommend this site to anyone
2	bought on price but delighted with the quality .
2	very fast despatch was a bonus
2	they are promt in getting the goods you orded to you in one pice i will always use them the shower_doctor
2	bought a babalat junior tennis_racket and ruck_sack .
2	i called them as i had a ouple of questions and they took time to help me make the right choice .
2	a lot of web storefronts don_'_t like picking_up the phone - but these_guys were excellent .
2	great price and arrived in a couple of days .
2	so soon in fact that i had to find a hiding place as it was for my daughter '_s birthday .
2	will_definately be back for more .
2	ordered a laser tape_measure on 00 oct . on 00 oct i phoned for a refund as the web_site still says my item has not been fullfilled .
2	minimum wait time is 00_minutes on the phone .
2	there is no way to cancel an order online so phone is the only way .
2	wae cannot tell me when the refund will be processed .
2	" as soon as possible " the lady said - and that is all she could tell me .
2	a good company would have sent an email to unfullfilled customers warning them of any delays .
2	i don_'_t know if something more sinister is occuring with this company but it only appears interested in hanging onto the money as long as possible .
2	ordered non - prescription_medicine on 0 / 00 , delivered for free on 00 / 00 by royal_mail .
2	also got a 0 %_discount by clicking on a facebook " like " link during the ordering_process .
2	the site is easy to navigate and use .
2	the cashback arrived within the expected timeframe .
2	great experience with new bosch washer and tumble_dryer .
2	this supplier has taken the buying of white goods over the internet to new heights of excellence .
2	from selection of product , through ordering goods , shipping and delivery , they really have got customer service ' bang on '.
2	ordering is so easy , payment is quick with no card charges , delivery day selection truly seamless and the actual shipping by the delivery guys was on - time , clearly communicated and so effortless .
2	will not_hesitate to use again and thoroughly_recommend ao . com .
2	great price given for an old bada os samsung wave , however it took 0 - days to acknowledge_receipt of the phone by c0p and another 0 - days for payment by them into my bank_account .
2	this is the 0rd phone i '_ve sold via mazuma this year .
2	i '_m now £_00 better off and wouldn_'_t hesitate in using them again when my family next decide to upgrade their phones .
2	far better enjoyable_experience in my opinion .
2	although i can accept budget_airlines have to strip cost out of their operations to make profit , at_least easyjet show some civility and expertise in their dealings .
2	i would much rather travel easyjet than ryanair anyday , but unfortunately their ' cheap as chips ' competitor seems to have the edge on providing the flying public with more destinations to the sun !
2	at_least easyjet make me feel like a human_being rather_than an animal being hearded in a cattle pen !
2	i have nothing but praise for this company !.
2	they continue to provide a great experience for on - line shopping which many others of their competitors fail to aspire to amazon '_s standards !
2	ryanaiir '_s motto is ' cheapest airline ' and that '_s all it is really .
2	they have managed to remove any civility or enjoyment from flying in my opinion .
2	i am obliged to use them for business , but i will no_longer use them for private use .
2	in my opinion they finally have mangaged to make the whole exerience uncomportable , from booking on line with all the £ extras , restricting hold_baggage to 00kg and insisting on their cabin_crew selling cheap features and offers in flight !
2	ryanair .... re - think please !
2	i would highly_recommend saveonlaptops .
2	my order was processed quickly and delivered on time the next_day .
2	both the communication and courier were quite outstanding .
2	i even received an email to tell me exactly_what time the delivery would arrive on the day !
2	remarkable service ....... and the best price on the internet for the acer 0000 laptop product i bought !
2	somehow , royal_mail managed to break my bottle of deep dark_brown in transit .
2	i refused delivery and emailed cult_pens to explain the situation .
2	eight minutes later (!!

2	never used this supplier before and was a little_nervous before placing an order for two new front tyres .
2	i found the website easy to navigate and it offered good prices .
2	arranged a date and time for fitting at a local tyre_fitting_centre at the same time as placing the order .
2	everything worked like_clockwork : checked with the fitting_centre that they had the tyres in stock before i left home and the tyres were fitted without_any problem immediately on arrival .
2	everything_went well and i am very pleased so i have no_hesitation in recommending tyre_shopper .
2	this is the first time i have shopped with hifix .
2	i bought a bose speaker_system for my computer and , at first , was a little_nervous that the price was too good .

2	i needed a fast wide - angle lens for a trip to iceland to photograph the northern_lights and hired a tokina_00 - 00mm from lfh .
2	great price and superb service from_start to finish - i wholeheartedly_recommend this company .
2	this company has a big range of room aromas made by many different companies , with products ranging_from medium to super strong .
2	they have the great new eu formulas in many different_sizes , and usually have a promotion on each_month .
2	the delivery is really fast , usually next_day , i '_ve encountered no_problems when using this company to buy products .
2	they are priced very keenly too , compared to the competition .
2	they also keep you up to date with a newsletter if you so desire ..
2	i '_ve managed a good few arders from this company and found them to be very professional to deal with .
2	when ordering online it '_s reassuring to get the tracking and confirmation emails .
2	i had an issue with a mistakenly sent product and it was rectified quickly .
2	the website is good and they usually have some deals on , ie 0 for 0 , plus it seems on a weekly_basis some reductions on various products .
2	all in all , recommended .
2	initially , i intended to use photoworld to produce some personal calendars , but i wanted to change the names of the days and months within the template into welsh .
2	i contacted the company to ask whether this was possible , but regrettably they could not accommodate my request , although they did promise to look into the possibility for the future .
2	i was so impressed with the friendliness and the personal_touch that i decided to place an order for a large portrait photobook as a record of our recent holiday in south_africa .
2	the software was very user - friendly and the results were stunning .
2	it really is an excellent product with brilliant quality and great value for money .
2	great live_chat support , by catherine_corless - sorted the problem out in a few minutes .

2	i have always found cheap_smells very competitive and a bonus is free delivery .
2	i thought i was doing a shrewd bit of business by not going to specsavers but how wrong i was .
2	the glassess i ordered were fine but to be honest november order beginning of feb delivery was rubbish .
2	i originally chased up my ordfer after waiting the required time and then asked if i could have a refund .
2	i was told that selectspecs have no responsibility once the hong_kong order has_been shipped so no way hose for a refund .
2	i found the attitude disgraceful and to be honest i saved a fiver and wished i had never bothered .
2	would not recoment selectspecs to anybody .
2	i was very happy with the service , professionalism and value provide by xupes when buying this watch for my wife .
2	thanks to joe , ben and frank all of whom were involved in this purchase .
2	can '_t fault them .
2	always best price and on time .
2	used this and another one for the last three years about to get motor home quotes .
2	it '_s always been pretty good and i got good quotes when brokers called me back .
2	still_waiting for item 0 month of placing my order for an item that was shown as in stock .
2	promote their buyers and sack their operations director
2	ordered item on 00 / 0 / 00 and received it on 00 / 0 / 00 at which point i no_longer needed it .
2	chemist_direct now refuse to refund my order and are ignoring my emails .
2	i will never trust chemist_direct again !
2	the clock seems to be just what i want ; the dispatch and delivery worked_perfectly .
2	so i '_m happy .
2	there was a slight_delay on delivery due to the company '_s supplies getting misdirected ; am happy with the product ; it seems of much higher quality than another brand i have tried .
2	my first purchase from taunton was just right - see my headline .
2	had been looking for an icebreaker fleece , they had it and sent it out .
2	the delivery firm provided a one hour_window and hit it .
2	if you like pens and propelling pencils , or even if you simply need them , cult_pens has a terrific selection , including refills .
2	there is always something i find that is better , i . e ., smoother writing or a nicer writing experience , than the last wonderful pen / pencil i found there .
2	they also provide terrific customer service on the odd_occasion on which you might need it .
2	the item arrived a day or two more quickly than i thought it would .
2	good site , good comms , fast delivery , nuff_said
2	sam s
2	following a discussion with the sales_director , i now understand and accept the reasons for the abnormally late delivery of our order .
2	the company were unaware of our opening_hours and the courier company attempted 0 deliveries shortly_after we closed .
2	i am happy with the reasons and that the company now know our opening_hours and given that all previous_orders have been delivered without a single_issue , i am happy to continue our business relationship with davpack .
2	i made an error in purchasing coffee_pods , got the wrong type .
2	contacted buongusto to see if they would help .
2	they were absolutely great - no problem at all , they collected the pods at the same time that they delivered the correct ones for my machine .
2	well_done !
2	max my son_loves_his converse shoes - they only last a year before they fall to bits from over use and a massive amount of running - shame they are so expensive .
2	but surfdome provides a keen price , advertises free delivery ( 0nd_class 0 - 0 days ) - why ?
2	if i send stuff 0nd_class it arrives in 0 days .
2	lets_see how long it takes but keep_up the good work surfdome .

2	back for some more thanks .
2	i have had some bad_experiences over the last 0 years with rotary_washing lines bending in their holes , so decided to bite the bullet and pay for quality - rang to explain the situation just to be sure that product would be suitable - 0 year_guarantee says it all - so order 0 - 00m ones they arrived very quickly and were installed immediately so_far so good - my wife is impressed , so hopefully we have found a great product - highly_recommended service and delivery - time will tell on product but hey with a 0 year_guarantee can ; t go_wrong - thanks - will be back for more after trial_period .
2	wanted a replacement rapitest electric meter tester as mine had died , an easy to use device .

2	still its there if needed and seems to have speeded_up my pc so thanks you - will be back for more bits when needed .
2	keep_up the great work .
2	the kids rattle through batteries with all their toys so having battery - force . co . uk just a click away is fantastic - order when you need them here the next_day and prices are very keen - think the addition of a chocolate is great - maybe two next time if order is over £_00 !
2	will be back for more no doubt with christmas around the corner - highly_recommend this site - thanks keep_up the great work .
2	ordered a portable power pack as reviewed in computer active on 00rd_august and it arrived on 00th .
2	have used it once so_far with good results .
2	am very pleased with it and impressed with the speedy service .
2	very quick turnround , competitive_pricing and no rip - off on postage .
2	will use again .
2	easy to use website .
2	items very competitively_priced and really quick delivery again .
2	the ship , and the crossing itself , were trouble_free ....
2	my ' gripe ' is that when we started the booking , the ' fee ' was £_00 approximately ... partway through the booking , the fee escalated , with no
2	reason being given , to £_00 approximately .. if i hadn_'_t been in such a need to book this quickly , i would probably have looked elsewhere ... the
2	fee should have remained the same as at the start of the procedure ..
2	i ' d ' like ' a refund , and may well pursue this with ' aferry ', unless of
2	course ' you ', ( as in ' this ' survey ) can forward my thoughts to them , and ' they ' will contact me .. ?
2	mike crook .... 0000 000 0000 or 00000_000000 ... any day , anytime after 00 . 00 am please ......
2	no stars , for a truly ' diabolical ' ' service ' ???
2	no service at all really .. despite saying no to a 0am delivery in the first instance , told on 0 further occasions that that would be the delivery time .
2	this was by the ' delivery company ' used ( yodel ) who were truly atrocious .
2	they did turn_up at 00 . 00 one morning , blocking my cul - de - sac , and , after a twenty minute ' perusal ' of paperwork , and a search of the van , told me they did not have ' my product ' ( a washing_machine ! )
2	on their van !
2	went back to k & co , and complained .. they said they would ' sort it out ', and asked ' when ' we would like it delivered .. we said " anytime after 00am , any day of the week " .. it turned_up , a couple of days_later , @ 00 . 00 !
2	.. at_least they did have the washing_machine this time , and , luckily , we were in to take delivery !!
2	.. on 0 separate_occasions ' after ' taking this delivery , we were rang up by
2	yodel , to say that they were going to deliver it ' 0 days hence ' from the phone_call !!!
2	...
2	truly unbelievable , and atrocious , ' so
2	called ' service ...
2	absolutely_appalling ...
2	the replacement memory arrived this morning .

2	very good website goods delivered promptly , and good value for money
2	excellent communication , user_friendly interface , allows the user the option of printing their own postal label and return_slip or having one sent , kept you informed of the processing , could recommend it highly_enough
2	great back up and customer service
2	came_across the site searching on bing and what a great site it is .
2	fantastic selection of outfits and accessories .
2	standard delivery was next_day .. great service , will_definitely be using them again .
2	i must_admit i was a little disappointed when i saw that the elected courier was parcelfarce .
2	however the driver did turn_up in the vicinity within the time specified , even_though i had to prevent him from driving off after he ' d attempted to deliver to the wrong_address .
2	having worked in a busy online sales environment myself , i can appreciate how the hard work done by the smith and morris team can be undone by a delivery driver .
2	i ordered the wrong item .
2	called bmc , all sorted with no_fuss .
2	thanks kimmy .
2	used you before and will use you again , had no_problems what so ever thank_you
2	bought galaxy_s0 , best price i could_find on the internet .

2	i had been looking for the guppie knive which is difficult to get in the uk .
2	afteridentifing a few stores heeinnie haynes were by far the cheapest .
2	communication was first_rate and delivery within 00_hours of order .
2	would defiantly recommend !

2	good price , easy web_site to use and quick delivery
2	need a battery for my watch , web_site easy to use , great price good communication and quick delivery
2	from ordeing my watch to delivery i was kept_informed of its progress and recieved it within 00_hours of placing my order .
2	the watch itself is just as_described on the website very pleased with its look and quality .
2	the only_negative is that i can see myself buying another model in the near_future !
2	!
2	best price on web quality product and fast delivery
2	very quick good value and great communication
2	rang them up for a previous model and got a great service and a cheap deal on the newest phaser .
2	helped_me claim the solid ink bonus and they were very clear about how to do it and sent over the claim pdf .
2	printer came next_day even_though it was xams and works great straight_away .
2	samantha came on chat .
2	she was so good and we both follwed through .
2	i was really impressed .
2	without her i would have been strugling , there is lot to fill in ,
2	well_done samantha
2	this is the place to buy electrical test equipment .
2	they ship quickly and vat ( gst ) free to australia in super quick time .
2	the only thing we have to do is put an australian plug on
2	it gets here quicker and is cheaper_than buying in australia .
2	purchased capella bedroom_furniture on 00 / 00 /_0000 home delivery .
2	several emails later not received confirmation for delivery .
2	finally they found order saying it was lost in system . the day arrived , guess_what 0 wardrobes missing , several emails later again they manage to locate order . delivery date 00 / 00 /_0000 another day off work , money lost . the point being all thi hassle but i noticed they never lost the money transfer in their system . i would not buy anything from this company as the tratmment is very poor .
2	g chester . 0 out of 00 .
2	despite the order summary of my tablet showing a certain value , with no sign of any delivery charges , days_later i got a letter from dhl asking for £_00 !
2	this was for importing item into uk .
2	this was never mentioned on the order summary and is not mentioned anywhere on the shipping and delivery section of the website .
2	i will not be using this site again as the tablet turned_out to be more_expensive than buying from a uk store .
2	whilst i have received payment via bank_account for transactions without_any fuss , i was very surprised that you are more than twice as long in acknowledging , processing and paying out than webuydvds .
2	it was a really lengthy process and i whilst i would recommend you to people who could_afford to wait longer , as you pay slightly_higher amounts overall ( not always ), if they want their money quicker and are prepared to forgo a few_quid , i would recommend they use webuydvd who '_s two cheques were with me before you had even finished processing my first order and they were collected only 0 day before yours .. so 0_stars from me .
2	room for improvement in your processing times .
2	decided to revive my vinyl career !
2	my friends at the lincoln store were very helpful and full of useful advice .
2	departed with a new project turntable , marantz amp and then completed the rejuvenation of my ageing system with a beautiful pair of mission mx0s , which were supposedly an open box / demo bargain , but on delivery were brand_spanking_new and fully guaranteed for 0 years .
2	add in the free cables and detailed advice re set_up etc , and i am a very happy customer .
2	whenever i have used superfi , they have come up_trumps for me .
2	i have used hifx a number of times .
2	site is very straightforward , they communicate well and transfer the funds quickly .
2	i usually check the competition , and they are always as good as anyone and no additional_charges , ( unlike the banks ).
2	recommended .
2	berghaus 000 wheeled duffle bag bought from the outdoor shop , arrived with 00_hours , and at the lowest_price i could_find on the net .
2	thanks for the excellent service .
2	every item in stock and delivered to my door within 00_hours of placing the order .
2	first_class .
2	this is now the third time i have used the currency_club for euros , all of which have been totally without issue and the money has turned_up by recorded delivery the day after i made payment every time .
2	highly_recommended .
2	with the greatest of respect to customers who have bad_experiences from poor service suppliers i do understand your frustration as i have been in the same situation myself .
2	no - one is perfect , there are always two sides to every feedback and ‘ circumstances can sometimes be beyond the supplier ’_s reasonable control ' such as bad_weather , third_parties and carriers , who can let_down even the most professional and organised companies .
2	i honestly believe it is how you react to resolve the situations that makes the difference .
2	ekomi arbitration system i believe is really fair for both_parties as it allows the supplier to explain the situation specific to your feedback and offer a solution for your consideration .
2	whether you are satisfied with the solution or not , if you respond within the time period ( both_parties have the same time restrictions ) your negative_feedback will be published alongside any comments from your supplier .
2	surely this is the fairest way for everyone , as it enables future visitors to make up their own mind on the relevance of the feedback by reading a balance of both points of view .
2	placed the order , got a confirmation , chose a delivery date to suit us and all was delivered and put upstairs for us ready to use .
2	what more could you ask for .
2	highly_recommended
2	very helpful in trying to track spares for earlier generation of compex devices .
2	i needed to transfer both domains and hosting from my previous hoster to 000 - reg which included 00 hosting domains .
2	it '_s always a concern when changing your hosting_provider but 000 reg have been supportive in that transition .
2	before i signed_up to the unlimited package all my questions were answered professionally and immediately through the live_chat_function .
2	after signup support was superb in helping_me load my mysql database .
2	the features functions and speed of the service is outstanding .
2	i had a few issues transferring one of my domains but 000 - reg resolved this quickly through their helpdesk ticket system .
2	i '_m also delighted with the performance of my web sites on 000 - reg , significantly quicker_than my last hoster .
2	i was looking for a hoster which included free domain transfer ins and free domain transfers out which also allowed_me to host multiple web domains which narrowed the field somewhat .
2	there are no significant negatives , perhaps the spam_filter could be better engineered as in its current form it '_s clumsy , as it will delete email it considers spam , it would be better if this went into quarantine to give you an opportunity to review .
2	the domain_registration costs can be cheaper_elsewhere but they are not excessive .
2	my previous hoster was heart_internet , who are superb , but there hosting_package was expensive for my requirements .
2	however , i still keep the majority of my domains with them as there domain_registration costs are unbeatable .
2	the other great thing about 000 - reg is they allow you to host external domains which means i can register domains with heart and host these at 000 - reg !
2	having surfed for the net for products of the same quality as provided by my chiropractor , i found natures_best to be the cheapest price for quality of products i was looking for .
2	i have used them on a quite a few occasions now and they have delivered my goods as ordered and within the timescale expected .
2	item i wanted was sold out and out of stock
2	able to leave details for them to contact me on website when item restocked this they did order made and item sent in time for christmas great service will use again

2	my 0st purchase of tyres on line however i buy most things now on line .
2	i purchased 0 tyres for my subaru forester - good prices with great choices of tyres at prices from budget to premium .
2	i find when you go into a supply they just quote for 0 budget tyre 0 mid rage & 0 top range going through blackcircles i was able to look at loads of tyres to choose the set i wanted & could_afford .
2	the ptoces was simple with good communication & a choice of fitters i chose protyres to fit who also gave a first_class service .

2	you can '_t beat this customer service and i cannot recommend them highly_enough .
2	brilliant !

2	this would be a problem as we were planning on attending on the way home from a 0 week holiday so would not be home to receive them .
2	i am relieved to get them in such good time .
2	thank_you .
2	i would definately_use double0tickets again .

2	i found the website very easy to navigate and had no problem in finding the selection of bulbs i was looking for .
2	it would be useful however to have a more detailed_explanation where there are a number of bulbs with the same specification but with wide_ranging prices .
2	for example there is a wide_range of gu00_bulbs and it would be helpful to know the benefits of paying a higher price for the same specification .
2	e . g is it of better constuction , more reliable , longer life etc .
2	order processing was efficient , communication was excellent , and delivery was rapid .
2	i have both a brother dcp 000cw printer plus an epson_photo stylus px000w .
2	i wasn_'_t sure if the compatible_cartridges would provide the reproduction of the original branded inks particularly for photos .
2	however this proved not to be a problem .
2	quality was excellent with the compatible_inks and the price based on 0 for 0 plus free delivery is the best i have come_across .
2	excellent quality , price , and service .
2	ordered my camera on 00th_april expecting a dispatch within 0 - 0 business days as stated on simply_electronics website .
2	the money (£_000 ) was taken out of my account the following_day .
2	three_weeks_later the order is still showing a new status with no_indication of dispatch date .
2	my first email to them requesting an estimated dispatch received a general statement relating to problems they were having but they would do their best to dispatch as soon as possible .
2	my second email was more specific relating to an estimated delivery but again received a response informing_me that they could not give an indication but as a gesture of goodwill they would expedite the order at no extra_cost to me .
2	well i am_glad i didn_'_t have to pay for this service since it made no difference to the order status .
2	seeing that others had problems waiting for a refund following cancellation i decided to raise the issue with my card company and received a refund within 00_hours .
2	they are no doubt the cheapest supplier in this market but one of the worst service providers i have come_across .
2	their website is festooned with acceditation on service which in my case they didn_'_t live up to .
2	if your priority is cost and you are prepared for a long wait for your goods then they may be the suppplier for you .
2	otherwise stay_away .
2	order my first pair of varifocals on 00th_november and received them today only 0 days_later .
2	very efficient and i have to say that i am extremely pleased with the frames and lenses
2	although dave the fitter wasn_'_t able to telephone ahead because he had received the wrong phone number .
2	he was a pleasant_chap and did a real quality job .
2	i will_definitely be using grippy again !
2	many_thanks for a great service provided .

2	my son looked up the best price for his iphone_0s and this company came top .
2	sent the phone off , and when we called them to find out what was going on , we were told it can to up to 00 days before the get a chance to looke at the phone , a few_days_later my son called again and was told the phone is know worth £_000 not the £_000 stated due to water_damage , which i find hard to beleive as the phone is only 0 months old .
2	spoke with a lady_called raj who told me that we had to go onto the system and cancell the order , which we did , that was last tuesday , today we call them again only to be told that payment has_been sent to my account for £_000 , after a long chat raj told me that she would give me their account details so that i could put the money backm into their account .
2	when i aske her the account number they had sent the money to see then told me it was a cheque has_been sent out .
2	asked if i could speak to a manager and she would not put me through , asked if any body regulates them and raj refused to answer .
2	the up shot is that my son has had phone for nearly 0_weeks and to top it all off they want £_00 of me so they can sebd the phone back .
2	please do not use this company they are the shocking ...
2	the lights are lovely and warm to look at so much_better_than shop bought , just right for what i needed the lights for , glad i found festive_lights , value for money :-))))))))
2	ordered some disco lights from a company in london that dpd collected on 0th_december that still_havent arrived .
2	received an email yesterday informing_me that the parcel was at thier depot in birmingham along with the usual lame_excuse about the weather .
2	its not bad for a delivery firm when you consider theyve managed to get a parcel 000_miles in nine days and still no sign of it getting here .
2	and it was sent on thier next_day service !!!!!!!!!!!!
2	!
2	this firm would make an ideal candidate for the tv program dont get done get dom .
2	i have just noticed the two emails that confirmed that the 0 orders had been delivered and placed safely before 00 . 00 in the morning on the date specified .
2	i am extremely pleased with the service and website and have / would recommend this site to any friends and associates that need to send presents .
2	i have shopped with ebuyer for several_years_now and have never had a bad_experience with them .
2	everything arrives on time or before and in excellent condition with nice strong packaging .
2	several_times they have upgraded my order to ' free next_day delivery ' – really great !
2	i had a fantastic experience getting the micro - filter that i needed .
2	a couple of weeks_ago i decided to clean the filter on the dishwasher which was when i found that the micro - filter was falling_apart .
2	so i went online to buy a replacement - the hotpoint website was near the top so i tried them and found something for £_00 +, i decided to search further to see if anything cheaper came up but no , several others around the £_00 + mark and one for £_00 +.
2	i thought that i would try local before ordering so i called the towns electrical retailers as they may have had one in stock but they did not saying that they could get one but it would be three_days and when i asked the price i nearly went into shock £_000 that meant that they were going to order the hotpoint spare and then add on £_00 profit !
2	so i decided to cut out the middleman and get the hotpoint spare_part .
2	it arrived on time and as_described and it works_fine .
2	linux , dns , hosting , wordpress ... its all so complicated , thank_goodness 000 reg support is there otherwise i ' d never get my website off the ground .
2	sorin is brilliant , understands what i need and gets it done quick - smart .
2	( marcia is less efficient , just sends me links to a bunch of jargon i don_'_t understand !)
2	no reason to look anywhere_else .
2	no delay with the christmas delivery !
2	that would be nice always to be able to say .
2	great product delivered with minimum_fuss .
2	recommended
2	westin_gourmet have excellent products which they sell and transport with great enthusiasm .
2	a telephone_call to assure delivery and instructions should we be out was impressive .
2	recommended .
2	excellent service
2	used flat_tv parts for the first time found them to be excellent company prompt at dispatch and great after sales service
2	best price i could_find , and very quick delivery .
2	overall , brilliant service !!
2	!
2	got fantastic service amazing delivery and a fabulous price on my speakers what more can i say would i recommend them you bet without a second thought
2	goods arrived as i ordered within two_days .
2	well_packed no_hassle .
2	speedy delivery of my son '_s bag .
2	when he ordered it on thurs he didn_'_t expect to have it to take to a tourament sunday but it arrived saturday ( standard delivery ).
2	delighted with it .
2	never had any_problems with viovet
2	good service and quick delivery
2	haveing found parcels to go , i now use them all the time , fast service , well priced , recommend parcels to go to any one , next time selling on e_- bay give them a try you will not be dissopointed
2	i needed to return a package to amazon for a refund and arranged for yodel to pick it up from me on a thursday .
2	i took time off work to wait in for them and of course after waiting all day from 0am ( in retrospect just a little_bit optimistic i admit ) no one showed up .
2	i emailed them via the link on the original confirmation_email address and eventually received back a couple of apologetic replies for the apparent hitch .
2	they told me that sometimes a van driver can be delayed and it might be as late as 0pm before anyone arrived .
2	however in an email from a different yodel employee i was told the latest for collections was 0pm so as far as operating times is concerned with this lot it '_s anyone '_s guess .
2	anyway , they re - scheduled collection for the next_day and , once again i arranged time off work to wait in for them .
2	well of course - yes you got it - no sign of any yodel ' ers all day .
2	i emailed back the company at around 0 :_00pm to get some idea of what was happening and to get confirmation that there would definitely be a collection but this time didn_'_t receive any replies back at all .
2	in frustration i phoned the local yodel depot and asked if they could shine any light on all of this .
2	the assistant , whom i admit was very pleasant , asked me for my name and post_code so as to check on the status of my collection .
2	thinking it would be more efficient if they used the customer reference_number which had been supplied in the original email , i offered that instead .
2	" oh we can '_t use those on our system - they never worked anyway " was the reply !
2	dear god !
2	anyway having punched my name and address into the computer it eventually said ' no '.
2	incredibly they could_find no record of me at all .
2	in the end i contacted amazon , explained the problem and with the help of amazon '_s customer_support staff have arranged for another carrier to pick it up in a few_days time hopefully with more luck this time .
2	i have also sent a letter to amazon asking them not to use this carrier in the future and i would suggest everyone_else with similar_experiences of this company do the same .
2	amazon '_s business reputation is going to be tarnished by even being associated with these_cowboys .
2	i '_ve also had similar_experiences to those mentioned by others with this company regarding deliveries .
2	' you were out ' cards left in our underground_car_park for us saying they had called and had tried to deliver a parcel when i know with absolute certainty that they didn_'_t - my door buzzer is as loud as a ww0 air raid siren .
2	like black holes , the mere existence of this company is a complete and utter mystery to me .
2	once anything gets sucked into it , it '_s nigh impossible to get it back out again ( that '_s the black_hole of course but you see the eerie similarity ).
2	used bulk_powders before and find them excellent people to deal with .
2	very efficient service and great value products .
2	if you don_'_t want to read my long review then the main_thing i recommend is that you go to the uk piano '_s site and get the guide they offer - it is impartial and will clear the fog around buying a digital_piano .
2	i also recommend you buy from uk_pianos if they have the piano you decide on with the help of their guide .
2	when i decided that a digital_piano would be a nice thing to have i was not ready for the confusion that awaited me – so many pianos and so many mostly incomprehensible features .
2	i searched various_sites and visited a couple of shops but my confusion only increased .
2	fortunately i discovered graham_howard ’_s ( uk piano owner ) guide and this narrowed my choice with its balanced approach focusing me on the things that really mattered ; the most refreshing aspects of the guide are that ( despite mr howard having a shop that sells pianos ) there is no attempt to either persuade the reader that spending lots of money is the only way to go or that you should only buy from uk_pianos .
2	i also emailed him with my questions and got very clear and helpful replies – again with no fluff or sales_patter .
2	having decided on either a classenti cdp0 or 0 i visited the uk_pianos showroom where mr howard asked a couple of questions and established that for our purposes the cdp0 would be the best choice unless we actually preferred the different sound of the cdp0 – again no attempt to sell us a more_expensive piano with characteristics beyond our needs ( and musical talents ).
2	the other staff there were very helpful in sorting_out the rest of the transaction and it was encouraging to see how enthusiastic they are about the products .
2	at the time uk_pianos price was the best available for this piano .
2	placed my order late on sunday and it was delivered early tuesday .
2	great product , great price , great delivery and they kept me fully_informed from the minute i placed my order .
2	there was even a label sticker with my invoice , in case i needed to return the product for any reason .
2	this is first_class service and i join the other 0 , 000 extremely satisfied reviewers .
2	mr . paul_richmond turn arround my case 000 degree
2	in 0000 , my previous solicitor had submitted my application for discretionary leave to remain on the basis of seven_years old child .
2	after 00 months homeoffice refused my application and demanded to leave the uk .
2	i start looking help on the internet and sent thousands of requests to many immigration lawyers most of them advised me to save_money and return to the country i came from .
2	but i am extremely lucky that i sent an email to mr . paul_richmond too , next_day i recieved a call from mr . paul_richmond , the way he defined me the situation i realised he is the person_who can help me .
2	in short he took my case and sent very effective legal letter to homeoffice to review the case .
2	within three_weeks homeoffice offered me tribunal review in the tribunal review mr . paul_richmond submitted about 000 pages skeleton , the judge was impress and raised the bundle in her hand showed to home office barrister again in short she allowed our appeal .
2	but homeoffice challenge it to upper tribunal .
2	in upper tribunal situation was more intense , there were two judges but homeoffice representative could not open his mouth because the points mr . paul_richmond raised in the courtroom were unbeatable and again both judges allowed for the discretionary leave to remain .
2	if any one wants to know full detail about my case and mr . paul_richmond '_s dedicated work please feel free to visit my web_site .
2	if anyone has any immigration problem please trust me it is so stressful and you need a kind and dedicated immigration barrister .
2	please_please don_'_t waste your money and time by knocking doors of money eating street solicitors .
2	i openly offer any one who_wants to see my both judgements i can show you just to prove i am 000_% right .
2	sorry i can '_t e_- mail you the copies , if you visit to mr . paul_richmond chamber then i can ask mr . richmond to show the copies of my court cases .
2	mr . paul_richmond , i don_'_t have words to thank_you but one thing i want to say you are the best .
2	good choice of products , good prices with an excellent informative service regarding order placed and excellent delivery . service
2	very easy website to navigate around .
2	made my purchase a real_pleasure .
2	pictures of the flowers were a real help and i am sure my mum will love the flowers we chose .
2	will_definitely be back for future orders .
2	keep_up the great work .
2	quoted £_000 for blackberry q00 through ee ( didn_'_t know they were in partnership with these !!
2	- if i knew would have avoided as after a bad_experience with cash0phones last_year , i always run checks on companies and their score and reviews are just as bad as cash0phones ) but sent monday received cheque for £_000 saturday .
2	am i lucky ?
2	- probably but got paid out in quick time so cant_complain .
2	tried cash0phones because they were offering the best price - big_mistake !!!
2	reduced it by 00_% stating wear and tear
2	eventually got phones back 0_weeks_later and had to pay for the privilege , i bit the bullet and tried mazuma , ok so a lower price quoted but was so peeved with c0p that i just wanted rid , sent phones on monday received full_amount_quoted in post thursday .
2	0 days from_start to finish !!
2	!
2	not the best quoted offer on the comparison site but for service top quality
2	highly_recommended !!!!!
2	!
2	d percival
2	my partner recently had a shocking experience with a mobile_recycling " company " cash0phones
2	i left an honest appraisal of the company on here and was shocked to find my review had been taken off as it had been reported as false .
2	any negative 0_star reviews on this company are always reported and subsequently removed whilst the amazing but obvious false pr driven 0_star reviews are still there .
2	it '_s a sham that a company can just report the negative_reviews and have them taken off
2	i complained to trustpilot and they did nothing !
2	this company is 00th out of 00 in their list of recycling_firms so to have no negative_reviews showing is a farce .
2	it '_s also eye opening that trustpilot is also bottom in the marks of their own rating comparison !
2	trustpilot , if you want credibility then you have got to clamp down on these companies that report all their negative_reviews and post pr spun 0 line 0_star reviews .
2	a review site is supposed to be impartial but this one isn_'_t !
2	please_please_please do what a review site is supposed to do and show reviews good and bad - dont make it so easy to block a bad review just because a company is paying you to be on your site .
2	for pages and pages of reviews to have been reported and subsequently removed on this one company surely shows that there is something amiss ??
2	?
2	very happy with the service supplied
2	i had top transport a sailing dinghy from the south_coast to the north of scotland .
2	received quotes and the delivery was handled smoothly and efficiency .
2	first time i have used them but it will certaintly not be my last .
2	good service
2	i ordered several hi -_fi separates from hi -_fi tower , somewhat apprehensively , because the goods felt too cheap .
2	however , the build quality of the auna items is top_notch for the price .
2	sadly the speakers made by ltc arrive quite damaged .
2	but the staff at hi -_fi tower were brilliant in arranging_collection of the speakers and sending out replacements .
2	initially , there was a mix - up on my order .
2	as a result , the company then gave_me a 0 % reduction on the price without me even creating a fuss .
2	so i am very happy with their service .
2	an excellent company to deal with .
2	would not_hesitate to use them again ..
2	superb delivery and communications , delivery tracked so knew_exactly_what was happening ,
2	the products are excellent , the solar fairy_lights look good and make a nice show , the hanging basket lights give a lovely soft glow making my baskets look good at night and give a lovely welcoming glow to those by our front_door .
2	they will look even better as the nights draw in , have to wait_until about 00pm for them now , but come august / september it will be great sitting outside on warm evenings with them on .
2	i have used dobies for about 00 years_now and find their seeds excellent quality , i always get very good crops and rarely any failures .

2	would recommend this site to anyone even mr . benn

2	secondly , the driver came at 0 :_00pm to our home .
2	much_better_than leaving them on the step !!
2	lastly , the driver was brilliant and really made the flowers special -- unlike most delivery people !

2	oh_yes , and the flowers are truly beautiful !

2	this is my first purchace from g , m . c . the product arrived within 00_hours , can '_t be bad .
2	the best thing is free p_&_p there are several sites offering the cutter at the same price but only g . m . c .

2	i would like to add a comment about trustpilots poor spelling i hate american spelling in english there is an u in fovourite
2	excellent service and internet prices !
2	they made sure that i had ordered the right gloves for my wife and myself .

2	the hestra_gloves we bought are exceptional .
2	will be telling all my friends try to edgeandwax first for their ski product purchases .
2	i will update this review once my parcel has_been delivered and returned back to me .
2	this is my experience so_far .
2	i used parcels0go to send a very valuable item to the usa for repair .
2	i was able to send it for half the price quoted on the official couriers site due to parcels0go .
2	as this was my first international courier experience i was a bit_anxious but the parcels0go people sent me an email_explaining everything and taking me step by step through the whole_process making it as easy as posting a letter .
2	i also have to mention the fabulous online live_chat_facility which i used when having_difficulty with the usa postcode system .
2	did the online_chat thing with an extremely friendly and courteous assistant named samantha and minutes later she had me sorted_out and moving_forward again .
2	a great experience so_far and i will be trusting parcels0go again to bring my parcel back if they can do it for the same great price and with the same great service .
2	very highly_recommended .

2	i bought a ticket to see the rolling_stones in stockholm .
2	it was easy to buy and pay for but what happened then was a disaster .
2	first , the ticket never arrived as it was lost in transit !
2	second , the replacement ticket ( seemingly not to the same value of the first ) turned_out to be fake and i could not get in to the concert !
2	what with the added expense of flights , hotels etc the whole trip was a total_failure .
2	and i am still_waiting for viagogo '_s response !
2	ps my order id was 0000000 , and the initial one was 0000000 .
2	this is first time i have used gear0music , and was really impressed with there service . quick delivery and plenty of e_- mails_keeping you informed , i would certainly recommend them .

2	!
2	i booked an oil and filter_change on - line and got a booking slot for some 0 days_later , had to pay in advance for some reason , and within 0 hour was called by custmer service who said that the branch_manager did not have any of that oil in stock !
2	how can it take more than 00_hours to get some ?
2	very poor .
2	i have been with 000 - reg over 00 years_now buying domain_names
2	to host on my servers and not there '_s by the way .
2	i renewed one of my domain_names
2	on 00 mar_0000 outofthebloom . com to be precise paid in full and have a
2	receipt for the payment .
2	the domain is still off line while they are
2	changing registrars is what they told me .
2	to put insult to injury they
2	have the domain_name pointing to a site that is ppc .
2	i phoned them on monday 00th
2	and was told it would be up by the thur 00 mar to confirm that they told me to look
2	in my 000 - reg control_panel .
2	i took a copy of the details so could show me client .
2	i then called today to find out why it is still not showing only to be told the domain
2	will not be up until tue 0nd_april .
2	because i took a copy of the web_site when it was showing 00 / 0 and now 0 / 0 that now makes the
2	domain_name that i have paid for in full will be off line for 00 days .
2	my domain_name off line for 00 days i you cannot do nothing about it with 000 - reg .
2	the administrative contact has also changed to @ domainbox . net by the way is a company that
2	000 - reg recently_bought .
2	i realy had high regards for 000 - reg and recomended all my clients to them .
2	this has totaly
2	changed the way i feel about the company plus i have now lost a valuable client because of all this .
2	don_’_t use 000reg .
2	this company has lost my trust completely .
2	try to use a direct / root registrar if at all possible .
2	could not be easier to shop online but the delivery service was rapid i ordered at 0 . 00pm and they were with me the following_morning top quality product with top quality service also offering the best possible price and as a yorkshireman you can '_t beat that owd love
2	hassle_free transaction , contents sent in discreetly_packaged parcel .
2	met the usual high_standards of quality , affordability that i have come to expect
2	used the watchshop for the first time .
2	not sure if it was going to be worth looking at the site .
2	thought if they were advertising all the time on tv all the time the cost would go onto the price of the watches .
2	but was very pleasantly_surprised .
2	price was the lowest i could_find online and the watch was delivered by next_day delivery .
2	ordered new jimmy choo exotic .
2	came relly fast .
2	a few issues with the website , but excellent speedy customer service sorted that .
2	lovely gift_wrapping .

2	the lovely sh !
2	girls also provided excellent , friendly and helpful service on the phone .
2	add to that a great choice of well - selected toys and other items , very attractive prices plus a bonus were you get 0 % of the value of your order as a voucher for future orders , and i ' d like to give them six_stars actually :-) highly_recommended , and a top - notch online shop by any standard !
2	i searched on internet for many companies who sell custom made computer but none was offering what i wanted in reasonable price .
2	either it was expensive for my demand or the componants were unsatisfactory .
2	then i found cyberpowersystem . co . uk and everything was easy , according to my criteria and most of all the price .
2	good business experince .
2	i would strongly_recommend to my friends and for my future_purchases as well .
2	easy ordering , quick shipping , great prices ...

2	well_done everyone .
2	would definitely use again .
2	with caravan insurance these days , you need new tyres every 0yrs - 0yrs maximum .
2	finding the right tyre for mine with the new li index at 00 was difficult , with the manufacture of the caravan quoting over £_000 per_tyre , ( sharp_intake of breath and a have sex and travel comment ) thought i would attempt to find some on the good old internet , again no chance till after a discussion on the caravan club web_site , i contacted etyres who not only were the cheapest but they came to my home and fitted them with no_hassle , soon done great job , excellent guy , will_certainly recommend them and will use them again .
2	a great well recommended postal service . ex value compared to the royal_mail , cheaper and quick ex pick_up / delivery service .
2	recommend , fast delivery no_fuss or problem .
2	i received the unit very quickly but it had a fault , the rpm was not working .
2	so i contacted them about the problem and for a change someone at hifi_tower answered the phone !
2	not like some other_companies i have dealt_with in the past .
2	so i sent it back via_royal_mail although i paid a bit more in postage than the max amount they allow ( £_00 ) fair_enough they offered for a courier to pick_up the item but i needed a replacement quickly . soon as they received it , i had a replacement by return post and i am well pleased with the turntable .
2	so for that i will give you 0_stars . recommended company .
2	thanks

2	looking to replace broken rollers for sliding_shower doors that were over 0 years old .
2	google searched and found this company - had good selection and saw one that looked like the ones i wanted .
2	they came within a week , royal_mail tracked , were exactly the right ones and at a ' reasonable ' price .
2	came in good time , well_packaged to prevent transit_damage and looked as good as new .
2	works well ( lenovo_thinkpad ) not dissapointed .
2	thankyou .
2	i can only confirm that having just placed an order with ringtons for tea and biscuits the products were both delicious and excellent value !
2	why don_'_t you try them ?
2	just great to have some of my favourite foodstuffs from the usa .
2	swift efficient service from my american_market .
2	it was a great idea to use the british_corner_shop to send loads of christmas goodies to our family in kansas and nebraska .
2	the box of british products was received on the due date and the contents distributed at a family party .
2	the whole project was easy to organise and exceptional value .
2	we will do it again !
2	i have just received my re - glazed glasses from you .
2	they are so much_better .

2	i bought from this company when they had high_street_shops and had a very unhappy experience but i can promise you that my recent experience was first_rate from order to delivery ... i bought the peninsula cherry triple_wardrobe because i already own 0 pieces of " peninsula " and the sale price of this item was too good to pass up ... this is a solid_wood item and because of the weight arrives in 0 or 0 different boxes .. it was delivered by 0 guys who , after much huffing and puffing , assembled it , cleared away all of the packaging and made sure that i was happy with the position and the condition of the assembled wardrobe ... i would not_hesitate to recommend this company , especially if you are looking for items from the new heights collection .
2	wide_range of products at very competitive_prices .
2	good communication and fast delivery .
2	everything you need .
2	i needed some pretty unusual drinks and i could rely_on thedrinkshop having them in stock .

2	i was about to book with sixth , with full insuranc , e when i tried florida car_hire , and i saved over £_000_pounds .
2	the only_snag was that i had to pay in advance , which i did not realise at the time of booking , but it was worth it for the saving .
2	i have used carhire_0000 many_times now in miami and in europe and they are fantastic never_let_me down , always easy to work with , they even called me once to confirm .
2	and i know that i am getting the best prices so i do not even check to compare .
2	my car_rental is over and done in minutes just like the car i have arranged a few minutes ago in palma de mallorca .
2	i think they are rob dogs they charge to much for using papal .. i wont have nothing paid into paypal as they want a arm & a leg for using them . no thanks
2	order number ... 000000000 .
2	phoned nitrotek to order a spare_part they put it in post got it next_day .
2	always helpful on the phone .

2	i think they do what they say when they say .. great company

2	received my g0 sunburst bass_guitar as promised today .
2	looks good , a0_condition .
2	in 0000 i decided on a trip of a lifetime to mauritius and settled on supertravel golf to arrange it all .
2	at the time i thought this would be one - off , but the holiday and trip was outstanding as were all the arrangements .
2	i had a year off , but suffered withdrawal symptoms and from 0000 to this year have returned annually .
2	that is now 00 wonderful trips that have gone like_clockwork with nothing going wrong in all that time .
2	supertravel have been ultra reliable and i cannot_speak too highly of them .
2	i '_ve_used e_- buyer now for many_years , always a great service , stock is up to date on the website , items are delivered as expected , no_hassle , no delays , just as you want it !
2	ordered a full pa_system saturday_afternoon , delivered on wednesday and thats with a bank_holiday monday inbetween .
2	gave_me good advice , would recomend to any one .
2	very good .
2	ordered guitar pick - up and strings one day and had them delivered the next at the stated time ; excellent service
2	struggled to get the aeg fridge_freezer that we were after , and kitchen_appliances 000 were helpful when taking the order where others weren_'_t .
2	it was a good price , although not the cheapest we found on the web , but we thought it looked a professional_outfit , and assumed that aeg would vet suppliers .
2	there was a bit of a delay as it was coming from germany , although communication was always as a result of us prompting for updates .
2	about three_weeks after paying the fridge_freezer , which actually requires some on site construction , was delivered and assembled by a separate courier company who could not have cared less ( amazing for such an expensive product ).
2	clearly used to just dumping items and clearing off .
2	screws went in threaded ( in a couple of instances so they actually scratched the doors on opening and closing ), units not lined_up , doors not lined_up , one foot bent in the process , and the top panel scratched due to repeated sloppy attempts to fit .
2	having compiled a pdf of fitting disasters and sending onto kitchen_appliances 000 we are still_waiting for a response .
2	we have given up on the courier company .
2	have taken it apart and refitted ourselves so that we can turn on and get using the thing that we paid for fives weeks_ago .
2	all in all a mixed experience .
2	the telescopic_ladder was just as expected - good quality at a great price - just the job !
2	!
2	fantastic deal very quick and very cheap
2	well_done to the seller
2	a fantastic firm who aim to please
2	they have the order on one day and its delivered the next
2	we have two cats and they are very pleased when the order reaches the house
2	well_done vio_vet
2	it is a great product & value for money
2	very good service & good product with an excellant price i will be useing them again
2	very good products but a bit expencive on carraige if only ordering one product
2	a . o .
2	com is first_class on all it '_s service
2	the hotpoint_fridge_freezer model stf000wg only had 0 door shelves so another was orderd & there was no egg storedge with this applience .

2	have never had a problem with them .
2	as usual item was was lovely .
2	my wife_loves it .
2	great price , equipment was just what i was looking for .
2	quick service .
2	only_negative was no munual with the trimmers .
2	well what can i say , i have some late deliveries in my time but have never had to collect a parcel from a courier services depot , they had contact number if they had problems and for some strange reason couldnt even find my address and have many deliveries to this house , the worst ever courier service i have ever had a due to that will be changing the company who used them to send my items .
2	they wernt rude to me infact couldn , t even get to speak to a human on the phone as it was automated ( wonder_why ) , im generally a placid person but this got my blood boiling , sort yourselves out !!!!!!!!!
2	!
2	searched the internet for a brother_mfc - j0000dw a0 colour printer / scanner /_copier and found printerland very cheap price compared to others .
2	i had a number of questions about the unit and telephoned them and got an immediate reply and good answers to my questions .
2	as the unit was for my son , i discussed it with him then telephoned them back to place the order .
2	telephone answered almost_immediately , placed the order and delivery the next_day .
2	then got an email asking if i was happy with everything to which i responded and got a reply email back thanking_me almost_immediately .
2	absolutly_brilliant service ; i would recommend them without hessitation .
2	like it says on the tin !
2	straightforward call , highly trained individual took details and introduced me to a local company , who checked my case and asked for photographic_evidence .
2	found the site on martin '_s money tips ( martin_lewis ) as one of the best value car parking booking sites .
2	the quotes for my requested holiday parking was easily cheaper_than any of the other_sites that i have previously used .
2	i will , without_doubt be using them again in the future .
2	have ordered both standard priced items and special_offer deals .
2	when you sign up to the newsletter there are some fantastic offers and savings .
2	very keenly_priced products and everything so_far has_been of an exellent quality .
2	despite several phone_calls i am still_waiting for a printer i ordered before_christmas .
2	three_weeks plus now .
2	i was told that snow was to blame a week_ago .
2	but 0 ) they managed to deliver the toner .
2	0 ) the snow was over by then .
2	they have made no attempt to contact me with an update .
2	my best gains come , at age 00 , from using sci_- mx all in one combined with met - rx bars and ready made drinks .
2	this combination is the best ever .
2	the service from these_guys is second to none - easy ordering , courtesy emails and tracking and next_day delivery !
2	brilliant
2	an excellent service not only with cost and simplicity - but also with the thoroughness of the operation .
2	the car was picked_up as said and on time , followed_by a detailed discussion around the garage findings , all work required performed same day - car returned - perfect and at the time specified
2	courteous seven day a week service and excellent follow_up - what can i say - i now use these_guys for my personal cars not just fleet as i used to do when employed in national roles
2	i use affordable_supplements almost_exclusively now .
2	they have a massive_range of products to suit every need , they deliver fast - usually within three day often two and the ordering system is safe and reliable and stores your details for quick entry
2	spend enough and you get points and credits and i often find a little extra in my delivery .
2	the product information is clear and factual and the range i consume does the business for me
2	as i am almost 00 my body needs supplements to perform as it once did and i trust affordable_supplements to offer me these , provide them and reward me for doing so - top_class
2	very good website , easy to understand , picked_up on time and delivered on time .
2	service exceeded our expections .
2	have usesd twice_now and will use again and recommend to our friends
2	the ordering was simple and straight_forward .
2	the delivery was very fast , could not be_beaten .
2	would use again and again !
2	i have just recieved my gaga tickets from double0 . i have always been very happy with all_aspects of dealing_with double0 and would recommend them to everyone .
2	they have good suplement , good quality and fast shipping . i recommend this company to all my workout friends and family .
2	delivered on time good quality just what we were looking for at a good price
2	advisor was superb - very helpful and understanding .
2	service very fast and we got the money through quickly .
2	used a voucher but that did not put me at the back of a big queue ordered one day delivered 0 days_later
2	0 ***** service
2	if i had to say anything fantastic
2	i wanted to arrange a multiple destination ( and quite costly ) trip to the usa at fairly short_notice , as my son was interested in finding out about us universities .
2	i had pretty_much worked out what flights and train_journeys we needed to book but thought i ' d just call to check if a discount would be available in recognition of the number of flights involved .
2	i never got a straight answer to that question and that '_s when the real nightmare began .
2	when i received confirmation of the flight details i noticed one of the flights was booked for the wrong time and we would miss our appointment .
2	when i called them they said they would need to check the recording of the call , which they would do very carefully .
2	i thought that was fair_enough and was confident that everything would be sorted_out , as i knew i had been totally clear about the timings .
2	then they told me it would take several days for them to get back to me with their findings , which meant the flight might become full in the meantime or the ticket price would increase .
2	they said they quite understood my concern and would be prepared to change the flight to the correct time , provided i paid a change fee in advance of of £_000 which would be refunded if i was vindicated by the call recording .
2	i reluctantly_agreed , then they later called to say this would apply per person !
2	i tried to contact them several_times afterwards but they never responded and never_let_me know the outcome of their investigation into the detail of the call .
2	in fact i never_heard from them again and an entire year has now passed .
2	their customer service is appalling , completely lacking in any sensitivity and their behaviour borders on the criminal .
2	somehow i don_'_t think this reflects the original vision and passion with which martha lane fox established the company and i '_m_sure she would be mortified if she knew how they treat their customers today .
2	i have used lastminute . com for the last time in my life .
2	i wish i ' d read these reviews before placing my first ( and last !)
2	order with this company for two ink_cartridges .
2	with no product and no contact to tell me what was happening i ended_up called them three_times .
2	their call_centre is so noisy you can hardly hear_anything .
2	the first time they said they were arranging for another supplier to provide the product because they didn_'_t have it in stock .
2	it would have been helpful to know that before i had to call in .
2	following another couple of weeks and another unanswered email , i was told in a second call that the reason i still had no product was that the third_party supplier had failed to respond ( could they not have tried a different one ?)
2	but they would definitely get in touch and call to update me - as if !
2	in the third call they complained that they had been " dealing_with a backlog of orders " and were experiencing " problems with our new systems ".
2	after nearly seven weeks they finally agreed to give me a refund which i am still_waiting with eager anticipation .
2	their upbeat website gives the impression of a company that will deliver - and quickly .
2	my experience was nothing of the sort because they delivered nothing whatsoever .
2	i '_ve never had to wait that long for cartridges from anywhere_else .
2	what a complete_waste of time and energy .
2	i knew what i wanted to achieve but wasn_'_t sure about which equipment would help me get there and enable me to strike the right balance_between cost and quality .
2	the micstore gave_me the in - depth , honest advice and guidance i needed to make an informed_decision .
2	they were really helpful and their response was always lightening_fast .
2	i will always go them first in the future and would recommend them to others without_hesitation .
2	customer number :_00000
2	not all on line shopping_experiences are pleasant - it '_s often tough to find the exact product you want on a messy website , sorting_out the payment procedure can be tiresome and then being told by an impersonal email that delivery is weeks away is the final_straw ...
2	not so with the furniture_market !
2	our on line purchase of a glass coffee_table was as clear , simple and satisfying as the product itself .
2	easy selection , simple finance , courtesy_call to confirm a fast delivery - these all added up to excellent service - that '_s how to treat a new customer !
2	of all the things i have bought online i have never had so much help with a plroblem the hifi - tower team
2	are 000_% thanks to all
2	keith
2	easy to put_together looks good in my small garden
2	we have used printerland several_times now for our printer orders , their website is easy to use and they have a great selection of product , and our latest order was no exeption , we ordered late thursday_afternoon and it was delivered friday_morning to west - central_scotland !
2	we also received a polite follow_up to make_sure the order was received , and at the great price we purchased at , then it '_s as pretty near to perfect as you are likely to find .
2	00 out of 00 .
2	well_done and thank_you .
2	this company made a mistake in sending me the wrong number of items but all was solved and actually they did me send one extra remote free of charge .
2	definately will use this company again .
2	sorry for the previous complain but i got it wrong .
2	thank_you very much
2	cleto capetta
2	this is a really good hotel / pub , the room was a very good size with a bathroom with shower / bath and loo . a large flat_screen tv on the wall , and tee and coffee making in the room . the full english_breakfast was excellent and i didn_'_t need anything_else for the rest of the day !!!!!!
2	they had live music on the saturday_night and had a good crowd in to enjoy it .
2	the place is in a good location to get to the lakes and all the other attractions the lake_district has to offer . if i go to the lakes again i would stay there again .
2	cheap good quality products that would cost a fortune from a vet . i already have recommend you to my friends .
2	i have always received first_class service from amazon every time i have used them . would recommend to enyone .
2	petmeds are the easiest_way to get the products to look after your_pets that i have found . they are cheaper_than most places ( vets and pet_shops ) and you don_` t have to go out to get them . i would fully recommend them to anyone .
2	really fast service - every order i '_ve placed has_been very promptly processed and delivered .
2	as a business i would recommend that no one use carphone_warehouse for business contracts .
2	they do not provide the same offers for businesses , yet charge more the privaledge .
2	i have bought a number of products and in some cases i have been so impressed i have ordered more of the same .
2	everything i have bought so_far has_proved to be good value for money and have worked as expected .
2	always easy to dispatch and track , delivery quick and reliable , royal_mail need to start taking note , this is how it should be done .
2	oh and lets not forget , collect_plus do it for a fraction of the cost .
2	royal_mail have lost a customer forever .
2	bought 0gb of memory for my ibm , it came within 0 days and was very well_packed , inserted the memory and all is fine .
2	would certainly use again .
2	purchased the crystal_head vodka on a saturday , got email confirmation of order straight_away , email confirmation of despatch on the monday and it arrived on tuesday , can '_t ask for more .
2	oh and the crystal_head , brilliant .
2	would certainly use again .
2	bought a bose_companion 0 , was out of stock on initial purchase , but i was kept_informed and actually received it 0_weeks_later , so i was very happy .
2	delivery was very well handled also , i was sent a text_message to say my parcel had been dispatched , and the next_morning i received another email from the courier giving me a time when it would be delivered ( 0 hour_window ), and it was delivered within that time_scale , so all in all a really good service .
2	as for the bose , wow what a difference to our movie viewing now , has taken me a few_years to convince the wife we needed something like this , and now she is also very impressed with the difference .
2	prices are competitive and the free delivery option tips the balance against_competitors .
2	i had a pretty basic order but nevertheless the online ordering_process was simple and delivery was quick .
2	recommended .
2	facewest continues to provide some excellent kit at competitive_prices .
2	it '_s nice to see a retailer concentrating on providing good quality ' outdoor ' equipment and clothing rather_than , as some others have , succumb to the ' fashion ' end of the market .
2	the discount bonus scheme does make a difference and encourages repeat_custom .
2	i thoroughly_recommend facewest .
2	fantastic product .
2	excellent quality .
2	prompt delivery .
2	thank_you so much .
2	i would recommend them to hifi - tower to anyone .
2	great experience and will buy from them again !!
2	!
2	this company are a joke and obviously staff_members write most of there reviews .
2	had major problems with a mobile_phone , was told to return it , dpd turn_up to collect the phone , i no_longer had the box for the phone , dpd were asked if the phone was fine on its own and i got told yes .
2	now get told by utility_warehouse that phone was broken in transit and they will not be replacing it because in there opinion i did not box the phone !!!
2	learn something from this folks , when this company mess up they will not take responsibilty .
2	as an ex courier when a customer hands me an item , i and the company are then responsible for that item and it is then covered by the courier insurance liability .
2	customer loyalty mean nothing to this company even taking into account i have 0 phones from this company and pay £_00 per_month for a shit service .
2	be aware people because i for one will be taking this to consumer advice , trading_standards and will also be letting everyone know on review sites what this company are really like when things go_wrong .
2	i recently had enough of intermittent internet and decided to move isp .
2	i telephoned the number on there website which they state " if you require a mac_code please telephone ........", to be told we do not deal or issue mac codes so just tell your new provider that you do not need one .
2	three_days_later i received a termination letter telling_me that as i had applied to a new isp they would now be disconnecting my phone and broadband , even_though i am paid up to date .
2	be very careful when moving to a new isp as this crowd dont_know the meaning of the word smooth_transition !!!!!!!
2	my advice , dont go with them in the first place .
2	this is the first time i '_ve had to source spare_parts for my brompton and brilliant_bikes seemed to be well_laid_out , well priced and comprehensive .
2	so i ordered the few bits that i needed .
2	i ordered them at around 0000 and they arrived by first post the following_day .
2	i '_m stunned !
2	that '_s an amazing turn_around .
2	i shan '_t look any further now for parts as brilliant_bikes will be the only people i need to come to .
2	amazing service .
2	thanks once again .
2	i will spread the word .
2	have been using their service for about six_years .
2	they have the best selection of outdoor hardware on the net .
2	i originally started_using them for knives but when i realised the wealth of hardware they stocked i became a loyal_customer .
2	any questions and they couldn_'_t be more helpful .
2	internet selling all over the web could_learn a lot from these_people this is what internet_shopping_experience should aspiring to .
2	their deliveries could only be made faster with the use of teleport .
2	if you don_'_t try this company out you ' re missing out on the best of the net .
2	reliable service , 0_stars
2	great prices , quick delivery and good service
2	i have been a regular customer of dv000 and they give excellent service , quick delivery , and without_fail the best prices on the net .
2	quick delivery and good service
2	best price and service i '_ve found yet , guitar delivered next_day with an accurate one hour delivery slot and the guitar was well_packed and in perfect_condition .
2	can '_t be_faulted .
2	good communication , texts and phone_calls .
2	very helpful delivery guys .
2	good experience overall , and very competitive as well .
2	i did have an issue with an item i ordered recently and it not being in stock .
2	the matter was dealt_with quickly and very professionally .
2	a replacement item was sent and received very quickly .
2	at the end of the day sometimes there can be problems , but its how you deal with the problem that matters .
2	heinnie still gets a big_thumbs_up from me .
2	we arrived early for pickup , the guy at the desk telephoned and got a car there for us within 00_minutes .
2	the car was virtually_brand_new and in excellent condition .
2	the guy at the desk was very helpful and polite .
2	it '_s not the first time i '_ve_used cult_pens and it certainly won_'_t be the last .
2	if you want best prices , super_fast delivery order form cult_pens !!!
2	!
2	one star but should be less !
2	this must be one of the worse companies out there .
2	i ordered a pair of boots which were " in stock " two_days_later i get an email_saying they are refunding as they are out of stock and my money will be refunded in three_days , so what with the weekend this gives them and interest free loan for a week .
2	i emailed them as they still show as being in stock and they offer me 00_%_off my next purchase of non sale stock .
2	and still they show as i '_m writing this as being in stock .
2	do not order from here it is all an excuse to expand their data_base and spam you !
2	super_fast standard delivery , you really don_'_t need to spend extra on upgrading delivery .
2	memory was well_wrapped and was exactly as required .
2	when arriving at malta international airport i found the car_hire section with no problem and was greeted_by a jolly young_lady_who dealt_with our car_hire professionally and with a smiling_face .
2	hi buddy the website is a very well_designed and idiot_proof .
2	item lost in post replaced straight_away . spanner is great service even better
2	ordered caravan battery by phone with good price and assured of next_day delivery because we are going on holiday . transport company failed to deliver so had to collect . advised tayna and they refunded charge even_though tayna had done everything correctly and delivery firm was at fault
2	very straight_forward and honest dealings . will_definately_use again .
2	first order placed and delivered the next working day - i will_definitely be using r & r in the future !
2	this firm saved me £_00 , they were polite , helpful and i would recommend them to anyone .
2	i put my order through late wednesday_afternoon and thought no more about it till the next_day , when i phoned the address i wanted it delivering to , to tell them it was on it '_s way they said it had arrived , now that '_s what i call service , if only other_firms would take a leaf_out of there book .
2	having read the reviews went_ahead and ordered a canvas_print on 00th_august_0000 and paid extra for next_day delivery .
2	didn_'_t receive an email next_day so emailed them enquiring as to when my order would be dispatched as i needed it for a client .
2	no response so phoned .
2	spoke to a chap_who said i would receive it today , 00th .
2	now 0 . 00 , no delivery , phoned number on website 0 times , no reply .
2	not impressed .
2	went_onto facebook and no updates this year , which raises further concerns .
2	wondering_if i will see my canvas at all now .
2	p . s .
2	didn_'_t arrive , now have to go to client without the canvas i ' d_hoped to give them .
2	let_down_badly by canvasprints online , i '_ll be looking for my money back .
2	pps arrived on 00th , well - packaged and good quality , so i will amend my star_rating from 0 to 0 .
2	the lack of any customer service , delay in canvas arriving despite paying the extra for next_day delivery has taken the edge of my first experience with this company .
2	great price , service and goods spot on .
2	thanks !
2	great service .
2	good value product .
2	fast delivery
2	will use again
2	purchased a hall_runner .
2	excellent product and couldn_'_t fault the price .
2	saved me the need to go out and look at several products before buying always a good thing when shopping for runners / rugs .
2	couldn_'_t fault the company at all .
2	definitely recommended .
2	recently_purchased a samsung 000 netbook .

2	these 0 goodyear_tyres were made in germany and came from germany .
2	i do not know how they were the cheapest of all the online tyre sites bearing in mind the courier costs which were borne by tyreleader .
2	by the time i paid for fitting myself , i saved about £_00 per_tyre over the fitted prices offered by black_circles , my tyre etc .
2	national_tyres who won_'_t price match anymore wanted £_000 per_tyre fitted so compared to them i saved £_00 per_tyre x 0 .
2	ordered them on a thursday and they arrived on the tuesday .
2	all the labels and markings ok .
2	i will use them again
2	i wanted a personalised manchester city football_club newspaper book for a friend '_s 00th_birthday in 00 days time .
2	no promises were made by customer service to meet the deadline , yet someone managed to get the book printed with my friend '_s name on the cover and a personal message through my door within 00_hrs of placing the order .

2	next_day delivery as requested and paid for of tub chair and bar_stools did not happen .
2	i was left to speak with the courier company only to find that my contact telephone_number had not been passed on .
2	dpd the couriers tried to deliver to the wrong street address and would not attempt delivery on day despite their mistake .
2	managed to secure next_day sat delivery and once had contact details were able to communicate_effectively with expected delivery times .
2	order received was incorrect .
2	unable to contact lakeland on sat morning .
2	sent email on saturday and got no reply until tuesday pm only to be told that fri would be next available delivery day .
2	after some to and froing and significant delays in mail responses this was accepted but far from the original next_day delivery expected !
2	dpd turned_up at the wrong street again but at_least on this occasion could contact me so could rectify mistake .
2	products good quality but service let_down by not taking ownership of the mistakes made .
2	good or great service can only be measured on company ability to deal with things that go_wrong .
2	average service on this basis
2	ordered on the wednesday and delivered following_monday on 0nd_class post for free .
2	other options_available if you want quicker .

2	there are few places where you can buy a weeks food shopping a welder a set of spanners a new tv and new underwear without leaving the shop ,, keep_up the good work !
2	!
2	i just had my licence renewal through ,,, it seems the bbc in an effort to save_money will no_longer be sending out tv licences ,, they just keep on record the fact you have paid ,, now that is the ultimate in bad customer service ,,
2	i thought it was expensive before when i got just a piece of paper for £_000 ,, now it seems i will no_longer get the piece of paper ,
2	does anyone know a way of getting round the system of licences ?
2	?
2	i have been on ebay for quite a few_years ,, obviously you have to be careful but i find its the best place to shop ,
2	we bought tachodisc software and installed it on a pc which unfortunately died ,
2	tachodisc will not re - licence the software even_though it is being installed on the same computer with a new hard_drive ,,, they insist we buy the software again ,, i seriously doubt that is going to happen

2	with simply_games they said order before 0 . 00 and receive your game the next_day , i said here we go again .
2	but every word was true , i ordered my game at 00 . 00 one day and it arrived the following_day ..... simply_games ...... simply outstanding
2	i research on the internet as usual to find the best price for your item , then go to topcashback to find out if the company you are buying from are listed , if they are well even more savings ,( but remember to always go to the company through the topcashback site ) and whatever you get its a bonus and if you use topcashback every time you shop online the pounds soon mount up .

2	ordered a canon_0d_mark iii ( as park were the cheapest around ) on a sunday_afternoon between christmas and new year and it was in my hands the following_tuesday .
2	superb service yet again from park .

2	ordered ( and paid ) for tickets 0 months prior to the concert and i had to chase them all the way right up to the day of the concert to find where the tickets where .
2	a believe me they do not make it easy to contact them .
2	in the end they told ( not asked ) me to collect the tickets from the venue .
2	when i got to the venue they knew that ticketweb had sold a number of tickets but had not been told who had what seats despite emailing them for the information .
2	out of frustration i asked ticketweb if they would be refunding the ' delivery ' cost considering they did not deliver them and i collected them and was told ' unfortunately , we are unable to refund your handling as the collection charge is the same cost as the delivery charge '.
2	so be warned the service charge is a levy applied for the privilege of receiving such a sterling ' customer service experience '.
2	i gave 0_stars , as their service & quality are second to none .
2	wonderful in every way , ordering , delivering & the quality of the flowers .
2	always great service from moonpig , & recently a framed print arrived broken .
2	although this was the fault of royal_mail , moonpig immediatly repeated the order at no additional_cost .
2	impressive .
2	the ordering_process with walton '_s was very simple to use , their web_site is informative & well set out .
2	i was kept up to date concerning delivery , which was ," right on time ."
2	i paid a very reasonable extra amount to have my shed erected , & this service was great , the two guy '_s being polite efficient & tidy .
2	most impressive .
2	for electrical product '_s i recommend go_electrical .
2	their service is most efficient .
2	i was emailed the arrival date of my miele_vacuum_cleaner , & it duly_arrived well_packaged .
2	very pleased all_round for service & value .
2	communications from ," pet_supermarket ," were excellent

2	i bought a 00kg weight set from fitness_superstore .
2	the product arrived very quickly and i was very impressed with the packing and the delivery .
2	the weights themselves are extremely good quality and i can see them lasting a long time .
2	great experience , would highly_recommend .
2	i ordered a bag from website that implied it was in stock .
2	it wasn_'_t and would take 0 - 0_weeks to deliver .
2	they then took a few_days to reply to my e_- mail about an_alternative .
2	this was also available on the website but i then had an e_- mail back to say this was not in stock and would take 0 - 0_weeks to deliver .
2	i have subsequently asked for my money back which again has not had a reply .
2	absolutely abysmal service , communication and overall experience .
2	this is the third time i have purchased from mr_memory and i am very impressed with all_aspects of their service .
2	the web - site makes it easy to identify the correct items to purchase , the pricing is extremely competitive and the delivery has always been very rapid .
2	the latest item was delivered ' next_day '.
2	an excellent company - well_done .
2	after i rejected bozowi '_s new offer , which suddenly was a lot lower_than first agreed for my iphone ,( basically they changed their offer once they had my phone ).
2	i wrote a review sharing my concerns .
2	bozowi did not like this and so they have threatened to sue me and have kept my phone and refused to respond to my emails .
2	why you ask ?
2	simple , i refused to allow them to rip me off !!!!!!!!!!!
2	i have informed trading_standards and bbc_watchdog .
2	use bozowi at your own_peril ........... you have been_warned !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2	!
2	i joined top cash_back and have found the new snap & save feature to be great as the cash is paid pretty_much within 00_hours after loading a copy of the receipt .
2	i find top cash_back very efficient and would definately recommend everyone to join as there is no annual membership cost so you get to keep all the cash_back to yourself .
2	posted phone afternoon by royal_mail first_class envelope provided by mazuma .
2	by the end of the afternoon of the next_day the money was credited to my bank_account .
2	not seen anyone pay someone so quickly .
2	superb service .
2	would definately recommend .
2	avoid auracall as their landline deal is terrible value .
2	they have it in the small_print that their option 0 only allows 000 inclusive call minutes .
2	yet their website misleads you by comparing their prices with bt and talktalk who allow unlimited minutes in their call allowance .
2	they start charging for their call package even before your line is switched to them !
2	customer service chooses to answer or not emails .
2	they answer easy emails and ignore difficult ones !
2	is very affordable with exceptional offers and quanities .
2	the extra trial offers " freebies " at the order page was a suprise and delight .
2	thank_you

2	i would definitely use them again
2	the website is user_friendly and has links to other useful things like theatre_tickets .
2	the email confirmation is instant and they send you further emails as your hotel stay gets nearer so you can make_sure you have your reference and anything_else you need .
2	i would use them again as the hotel is £_00 a night cheaper_than it would be if i ' d booked with the hotel directly so that a great result !!
2	!
2	i found the currency_club online .
2	their exchange_rates are the best i could_find anywhere and no commission charge .
2	my money arrived next_day , it was so easy .
2	i cannot recommend them too highly .
2	the fire_pit arrived the the next_day after ordering and was £_00 cheaper_than on amazon , which is normally unheard of .
2	there was loads of communication from homesupply asnthe the processing of my order and even the courier could not have been more helpful .
2	i would use homesupply again at the drop of a hat .
2	brilliant !
2	double 0tickets . com are a company that delivers what they promise " the best seats in town " for any event .
2	ultra - smooth_transaction from_start to finish , great security regarding the mailing of tickets .

2	as a professional software engineer , i have dealt_with a lot of technology companies over the years , and i have never found one that matches quiet_pc on service .
2	i had very particular requirements , which they were happy to discuss at length , until we had agreed a pc that was perfect for my needs and still within my modest budget .
2	the fact that my new pc is entirely silent ( except when i am using the dvd_drive ), is a huge bonus .
2	i cannot recommend them highly_enough .
2	if you are thinking of buying a new pc , start by talking to the friendly and extremely knowledgeable guys at quiet_pc .
2	i wanted a laptop for video and photo_editing that did not cost an arm and a leg and was not too heavy but had a good screen .

2	the result is a very capable machine that does processor hungry tasks at a decent speed in a laptop that can be carried easily .
2	i had a problem with the power_supply that i bought after one short and courteous phone_call the item was replaced and the price difference refunded .

2	however they did not require a signature and left the goods visible in my front porc even_though i was in the house !
2	i said it all above

2	i can '_t fault them
2	good service backed_up with a one to one telephone contact .
2	i was surprised that having a uk company address the camera came from the states , but it did arrive quite quickly and in good order .
2	however , the second battery purchased with the camera was an after - market copy ( not nikon ) and in - spite of its price ( not cheap ) didn_'_t work .
2	also , there are cheaper sd_cards available in the uk on the internet .
2	so overall the shine was taken off the new toy by a poor product but i can '_t complain_about the service .
2	a top_notch firm whose shops are amongst the best for quality of products , competitive_pricing , reliability of delivery , and pleasantness of staff
2	talk_talk get a lot of flak but other than changing my contract without telling_me i have found their service ok
2	i have nothing but praise for amazon .
2	they get it right every time
2	this is a terrible comany .
2	after promising immediate delivery nothing has_been heard of from them in the last three_weeks .
2	the telephone is not answered and they do not reply to e_- mails .
2	i suppose my money is lost and i will have to look_elsewhere for the product .
2	i could perhaps take legal_action .
2	they do not deserve the one star_rating that i have given them
2	a 0 ***** company .

2	saved a fortune last christmas by buying the offers to give as christmas_presents .
2	i highly_reccomend them !
2	i love the bird_seed mixes that combine advit - a vitamin_supplement that it is already added to some of their bird_seed mixes .
2	their premium songbird mix is the best product i have found anywhere both on and off line .
2	the variety of nuts for wildlife is superb with some having the option of being in the shell or not .
2	order received very quickly and well_packed .

2	great service .
2	fantastic range of products !
2	a great value for money network !
2	worst customer service ever_experienced !
2	i made a substantial order to restock all my cat_food for a few_months .
2	a bozita cat_food box weighs 000gms & there are 00 boxes in a case .
2	i ordered 0 of these cases along with 0 of each of whiskas anti - hairball , whiskas temptations & whiskas katzinis .
2	the containers for the whiskas items are very thin & weak & therefore should not be packed with an item weighing 0 . 0kg ( weight of a bozita cat_food case ), as anybody with common_sense would know that the whiskas containers would break & damage the contents .
2	well someone_who had no common_sense did just this !
2	they packed 0 whiskas containers with a case of bozita cat_food .
2	this resulted_in the whiskas containers being smashed into tiny shards & the contents to granules , not to mention the amount of cleaning up i was left to do !
2	i therefore contacted pet_supermarket by email in the 0nd week of january .
2	i received a couple of emails to find out if i still had the remains of the damaged goods & with every email i received i responded .
2	however , i have had no reponse whatsoever since 00 / 00 / 00 despite replying 0 times !
2	it has now been over 0 month since i had a response .
2	worse still 0_weeks_later ( today '_s date is 00 / 00 / 00 ) the issue has not been resolved & i have received no refund or compensation !!!
2	!
2	i will not be using this company ever again !
2	their packing service it sub - standard & customer service shambolic !
2	i suggest that others do not use pet suupermarket as you will lose money and get ripped_off !
2	needed a brew that would be straight_forward to do as i had been away from the art of homebrewing for a lot of years , and the products had changed since i had last attempted to brew my own beer , got the advice and the equipment i needed all inside 0 days , and a voucher as well , great stuff . never had a bad beer yet , thanks again .

2	ordered wormer for dogs .
2	arrived within 00_hours
2	was actually refused an account even_though i have the highest possible credit_rating .
2	asked for explanation and was fobbed_off .
2	wrote and sent copy of credit ratiing just to prove a point .
2	have not even had the courtesy of a reply .
2	my 0nd 0 month loan , no person contact ( not required ), smooth instant payment into my bank_account , 0 days notice for next repayment ( which i have always paid early to save some interest .
2	i would highly_recommend anyone doing the same .
2	russell 0000 000 0000
2	my story is as follows :-
2	interlink_express driver fraudulently signs for parcel
2	courier given access to a block of private flats , customer appears not to be in , does not leave card but does decides to ( fraudulently ) sign for it himself and then leaves it somewhere - parcel goes missing .
2	interlink_express couriers - all lies
2	my local interlink depot spokesperson has told me that the courier involved , says he went back to the flats yesterday ( 00st_jan ) to investigate and sort_out with the customer but could not gain_access and that the customer was not in - completely false as the customer has_been there since sunday and is still there .
2	i was then told that the courier left a card this time - completely false again as the customer has his own numbered letter_box , and he has just been to check this on my advice , and nothing is there .
2	i have a contract with my customer who has purchased my goods and expects to receive these , i shall honour this and make_sure that he does .
2	interlikexpress . com breach of contract
2	it appears that interlink who has a legal contract with my business , are more than happy to employ staff who blatantly break the terms of this contract and then lie through their back teeth to protect themselves .
2	they then inform_me that there is nothing further that they can do and that this is now an insurance claim , i advise them that this is not an insurance case and that this is fraud and ask what they are going to do about it , i am informed to take it up with the insurance department so the buck is passed on further and i , my business and my customer can go and get *******
2	people beware !
2	if you have similar stories , please share these ....
2	i ordered my nikon 00 - 000mm vr lens on a thursday and it arrived early the following_monday_morning !!!
2	considering it came from_hong_kong and there was a weekend in between i think the service was unbeatable .
2	coupled_with this the price was unbeatable too , the cheapest anywhere online by miles .
2	my local camera store wanted £_000 . 00 for this lens , i paid £_000 . 00 and free delivery here on digitalrev .
2	i cannot express enough how fantastic this site is ..... quite literally out of this world .
2	i will only be buying from here in the future , just wish i had discovered it early .
2	oh ... i forgot to mention how great the item was packaged !!!
2	it arrived in mint_condition and had been wrapped in about 0 metres of bubble_wrap and put into a sturdy_box .
2	well_done digitalrev ..... you offer by far the best deals and service anyone could ever wish for .
2	i recommend everyone should try digitalrev ... i guarantee you will not be disappointed .
2	i purchased a usb borescope and am_delighted with its use and performance .
2	the whole_process from purchase to receiving the goods was excellent .
2	i would certainly recommend hifi - tower as a 0_star operation , and would highly_recommend .
2	i decided to use collect_plus to send a parcel to scotland .
2	i booked my delivery and got the parcel posted straight_away .
2	so_far so good .
2	i followed the tracking and the item was delivered on tuesday according to records .
2	this of course was untrue .
2	after telephoning their_offices i was told the item had gone to the wrong_address and they were unable to recover it .
2	this has to be the worst courier ever and i urge_everyone who is thinking of using them to think again and go back to a reliable service like royal_mail .
2	i would also like to add that trying to claim a refund is just as bad .
2	would it not be easier to simply credit my paypal again rather_than having me need to gather so much information and then email this to you .
2	i am not very good with computers .
2	you already have the tracking_number and have admitted losing the item .
2	update .
2	your answers to my complaints have shown just how much attention you really do pay .
2	i am the seller and its me that is complaining .
2	you are not in contact as you say in your statement .
2	i have been told to fill in a complaint form and gather all the information to get my money back .
2	you should return my money with paypal and stop messing me around .
2	you company collect_+ really are incompetent and hte replies you are sending should be read by all future clients before they make the same mistake i did .
2	i was looking for tyres online after my local_dealer quoted a daft price for two new ones .
2	i came acrosstyres on the drive and decided to give them a try .
2	the online ordering was easy and i was contacted within an hr to confirm my booking .
2	job organised for between_0am and 00am .
2	the fitter arrived at 00 : 00 and went straight to work .
2	00_mins later he was all done , this included checking my rear_tyres and pressures and my front_brake_pads all for nothing .
2	his vehicle was equipped to a high_standard and was the cleanest ive_ever_seen .
2	the fitter himself went through all the paperwork with me and made sure i was happy before taking my payment ..
2	i am going to use the service in a couple of months to replace my rear_tyres .
2	dont_waste your time going anywhere_else , these_guys are brilliant .
2	service with a smile .
2	00 / 00 .
2	i was searching for a good quality cycle_helmet and found a shop called speed and sport selling just what i was after .
2	i bought the rudy_project sterling for £_00 inc_p_+_p .
2	the helmet is a perfect fit and is ultra lightweight .
2	the service from the shop was also 0st_class and i received it in only 00_hours .
2	go on treat_yourself .
2	no_problems , well made and quick dispatch
2	good idea and easy to use website .
2	just it seems very slow to be able to collect your money and also there seems to be a lot of problems with merchants not giving you your money ... staff seem very friendly and helpful ... i probably will not bother any more after i get my money this time .
2	purchased endura mt000 elbow guards after usually excellent local bike shop couldn_'_t find any in stock from their suppliers .
2	rutland had them in stock at an excellent price .
2	arrived in 0 days and were exactly as_described .
2	recommended supplier and product !
2	great selection on web and easy to order .
2	wasn_'_t sure which product i wanted so ordered two - the quality was great , as expected from converse .
2	return prcoess ( for other pair ) was easy and refund was very quick .
2	would strongly_recommend .
2	wherther on - line or over the telephone , my experience on eacjh occasion was first_class .
2	quick response and quality products , which arrived in perfect_condition ; very impressed .
2	when a company is providing a first_class service , what more is there to say ?
2	cpc farnell have supplied my requirements for many_years_now and i have never had cause to complain .
2	keep it up .
2	it is extremely rare to find a u . k . company that can consistantly provide an excellent service .
2	costs a little more than off - airport_parking but much less messing_about than waiting for busses or mini - busses .
2	when arriving back in the uk there '_s no waiting ; walk to your car and drive !
2	perfect .
2	delivered exactly when promised .
2	hard to improve on that !
2	thank_you .
2	i decided to buy two x_0m hdmi_cables from this company and i based the decision solely on price .
2	but the quality is superb so don_'_t hesitate to try cablesuk . co . uk and you '_ll be as pleased as i was .
2	solid_construction and a good , tight fit into the hdmi sockets on my panasonic hd plasma set .
2	items beautifully_packed and presented with extra packaging provided in case the gift is for forwarding to someone_else .
2	fast delivery too .
2	thank_you .
2	looked around for product both online and in retail and found what ambient was offering to be the best option available both in quality and price .
2	decided to place the order and have been more than satisfied with delivery etc .
2	not yet installed but do not envisage any_problems .
2	first_class product and excellent service .
2	sold non working samsung_galaxy_note for £_00 , then got email_saying that engineers had valued it at £_00 !!!
2	and if i want it returned it would cost £_00 !!
2	totally_unacceptable !
2	very misleading , scamming company !!
2	!
2	good site , fast support , great products a +++
2	google rule , if you need to know they got thwe answer a +++ the only search_engine on the internet in my eyes
2	the worst site on the internet .
2	they support sucks they have no intrest at all .
2	stay well clear use amazon or any other site .
2	i needed a cheap medium capacity micro_sd_card for a phone .
2	i chose kikatek as their pricing was good , and reputation fine .
2	in the event the card arrived promptly , was well_packed and just the job !
2	would recommend others to this supplier .
2	i purchased an aqualisa midas shower .
2	this was offered at a very competitive price , and easy to order .
2	the item was delivered very promptly , and well protectively packed .
2	would use this company again .
2	i have often used seafrance , and now have experienced myferrylink on a motorhome crossing to calais and return .
2	the telephone booking service was exemplary , with the sales_assistant being as helpful and friendly as you could wish for .
2	the booking in , and crossing was on time and fine - the ship was clean , and plenty of space .
2	the return from calais was equally efficient , with check - in staff being friendly and flexible over our change of sailing time .
2	so in summary i would recommend myferrylink - the service is as good as the former seafrance , the pricing is very reasonable , and the ships are clean .
2	i purchased some basin and bath_taps from the company , and am very pleased with the service .
2	my internet order was quickly acknowledged with a clear e_- mail .
2	the products were despatched exactly as indicated , with delivery received on the day stated .
2	the taps were very well_packaged to ensure they remained undamaged , in a strong outer_cardboard_box .
2	the quality looks fine , and will install in a day or so .
2	would recommend to others - particularly as they actively_seek out reviews on an independent website , so clearly wanting to offer quality service .
2	the company responded_immediately with an order confirmation , and kept me informed via e_- mail at each following stage .
2	they despatched the post hole auger the following_day , with a link to the despatch company tracking_system .
2	the despatch company ( city_link ) delivered following_day - so very quick receipt following web order .
2	the item was an awkward shape ( large 000mm diameter metal screw_thread on long shaft ) but was extremely well_packed , with all areas likely to be damaged well padded .
2	i received the auger in perfect_condition - and so am very pleased with the company in all_respects .
2	the auger looks very good as well , and this company was one of the cheapest - including p_+_p .
2	i would definately recommend them .
2	i ordered an extended monobloc basin_mixer_tap and sprung waste , and items arrived quickly .
2	they were well_packed and the quality of both looks good .
2	the pricing i felt was very fair ,
2	yesterday i ordered a " ladder type " chrome_radiator for our cloakroom - about mid - day .
2	today , mid_morning the radiator arrived !
2	the radiator was well_protected , and once unwrapped looks perfect .
2	the chrome_plating looks high_quality , in fact all_aspects of the radiator look good quality .
2	i would certainly recommend this company to others wanting quality radiators delivered quickly - and at a very fair price .
2	i had no previous experience of this company , but chose it for a countertop wash_basin on basis of price , product description and good web reviews .
2	the item arrived today via a good carrier - fedex .
2	the carrier very carefully handled the product , and this care continued into the protective_wrapping .
2	substantial bubblewrap protected the basin inside it '_s cardboard_box .
2	one " even better if .." comment would be that some bubblewrap should be also used inside the box to stop the basin moving around in the box .
2	however the basin is in perfect_condition and looks very good .
2	it is uniformly round and sits nice and flatly on my countertop .
2	so i would recommend this company to others - for delivery speed , product quality and good pricing .
2	i ordered a closet auger on a saturday_evening , and received an initial esponse from the company 0 . 00 monday_morning .
2	then despatched that day and received tuesday_morning .
2	well_packed , and carrier ( royal_mail ) delivers early around here - so toilet problem quickly sorted !
2	would use this company again in future .
2	a mixed bunch of bits and pieces ordered - and i valued the ability to have them delivered at a day i selected .
2	they arrived exactly on time , and well_packed .
2	my only small_gripe was that web_site will not allow me to input my address properly - my combination of village and town it does not cope with !
2	all in all a good service which i would use again .
2	the products quality are all fine
2	i purchased a samsung_tv - and prior to this telephoned the company on a query .
2	the call was efficiently answered , and led me to order the item .
2	i liked the security telephone_call following a purchase , and appreciated the precise details of delivery day and carrier .
2	the item arrived in perfect_condition exactly when the company said it would - just a few_days after the on - line order .
2	would recommend this supplier .
2	the laptop was one of the lowest_price ones via_google_search .
2	i ordered midday and arrived 0 . 00 am next_day via courier - even_though i had opted for free delivery for up to 0 days . the company kept me informed of each_stage of progress via several e_- mails 00 in total ) including delivery timeslot .
2	the item was in perfect_condition and works just fine .
2	so in summary the company had a very competitive price , had exemplary delivery .
2	was excellent in keeping_me appraised of progress , and the item was perfect .
2	i would have no_hesitation in making further_purchases from them in the future .
2	i cannot judge their service on returns as the item is not faulty !
2	many quick service good reference of the products to shops of shopping !
2	i ordered a watch from iconic_watches as advertised on their website i paid my deposit and received an email_stating 00 - 00 days for delivery i anxiously waited 00 days then got in touch with iconic_watches to find out what was going on .
2	i received a reply that they were going to get in touch with their suppliers and would be in touch .
2	i then received a further email_stating that the watch is no_longer available .
2	in iconic_watches favour a refund of my deposit was promptly paid but why o why do they advertise watches they do not have and cannot obtain and still take a deposit .
2	i could of at the time of placing my deposit with iconic_watches obtained the exact_same watch from an other company guaranteed in stock albeit at a cost of £_00 more but in hindsight £_00 on a watch costing over £ 0000 would have been worth it .
2	my experience with iconic_watches has therefore been a negative one and i would have second and third and forth thoughts before i place another order with them in other words never again .
2	i ordered a metabo kgs 000 with a different online supplier expecting a next_day delivery , money was taken for payment , but as i missed the order cut_off time , it meant it would be delayed by one day .
2	after not receiving a confirmation of dispatch email , i called the supplier only to be told that the saw is not in stock and would take a further 0 days to deliver .
2	i cancelled the order .
2	i found ffx and found the same saw for a lot less .
2	as i needed the saw for saturday i called ffx but i was to late for a next_day delivery , but after explaining the situation with liam at ffx , he went out of his way to arrange a saturday delivery which added £_00 . 00 to the bill but still a lot cheaper_than the previous_supplier .
2	the staff at ffx are very helpful , thanks to liam and lee for a professional and helpful service .
2	mike .
2	right from the start , it was very easy to sell your old phone .
2	you were offered very competitive_rates too .
2	you were able to track the selling progress at all times and i was able to know that my old phone was accepted the very next_day .
2	i stand by this company who are easily ahead of the rest .
2	this is about the fourth order i have placed with gear0music and they are great !
2	good price , great communication and rapido delivery , keep_up the good work boys and girls !!!!
2	!
2	goods arrived the day after ordered and are exactly as advertised .
2	if i ever need another waistcoat i '_m coming straight back here .
2	i ordered a special kind of gel that i had previousl ; y obtained from my doctor .
2	to my surprise the price here was much_lower .
2	the speed of delivery was as expected .
2	i highly recommedn this site .
2	i ordered a pair of fitflops from this company on 00 / 00 / 00 .
2	today ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) i '_ve finally lost_patience .
2	i suspect they ' re simply ' boxshifters ' - if it '_s in stock , fine but if not .....
2	the problem is they won_'_t bother to inform you of what '_s going on and they left it to me to chase them .
2	several of my e_- mails were simply ignored but eventually i got a reply telling_me they were awaiting stock and would contact me - the problem is that they don_'_t and it '_s left to you to chase them ( again ).
2	their only redeeming_feature is that they refunded me promptly .
2	i was left with a promise that the ' d contact me when the goods were in stock and i could re - order but of course they don_'_t contact you ....
2	take my advice : before ordering , check with them by phone that the item '_s in stock or better still , order from another company who actually do what they promise .
2	postscript : shortly_after_posting the above review , the owner of shoetique contacted me to apologise .
2	he offered to send me a free pair of fitflops if i would delete my review .
2	to my shame , i accepted his offer , giving him my word that i would delete the review upon_receipt of the goods .
2	he then asked that i delete the review first - this was the final_straw and did me a favour by jolting me back to reality !
2	i '_ve declined his offer and stand by my comments .
2	we '_ve now ordered from running bare instead - i suggest you do the same .
2	i have made several separate_orders after noting competitive_prices from a wide_range of products on - line .
2	delivery was well on time with helpful people helping check items before going away .
2	after ordering one item i searched other_sources , including local showrooms but i found that betterbathrooms had attractive products at remarkable value even when delivery charges were added .
2	i came back on 0 or 0 occasions !
2	prices seem good most of the time and even better with some gifts / promo '_s for quality parts and good stock_levels .
2	delivery has_been good for most purchases once a bit_slow but should now be ok as they have changed delivery company .
2	very fast service and were good enough to contact me when payment made twice by mistake .

2	i bought a leather flip case for my htc phone from londonmagicstore through ebay .
2	it arrived within three_days , is of excellent quality and was only £ 0 - 00 with free delivery .
2	you just can '_t get better_than that .
2	after perusing local_stores i checked on the internet and discovered fragrance_direct and made my purchase .
2	it was that simple and straightforward and the delivery was first_rate .
2	about 00 years_ago at 00 i decided my body might benefit from some assistance and so commenced purchasing supplements fro natures_best .
2	i hadn_'_t really thought about sourcing from another supplier until a friend showed me his that he has_been purchasing from simply_supplements at prices that were better_than natures_best ..
2	i checked out their website and placed an order .
2	i was impressed with the website and ease of ordering , and even more impressed with the prices .
2	i have placed several orders since and have every intention of continuing .
2	ordered a couple of keys , arrived next_day and that '_s about it .
2	will_certainly use again .
2	fast delivery , quality product and good customer follow - up support .
2	certainly found the whole purchase easy and am 000_% confident in the reliability of the memory_modules that i ordered .

2	product arrived soundly packaged the next_day - very happy with facewest
2	i found these_people whilst looking for a transfer to my hotel in corfu . their website was easy to use and the cost was very reasonable .
2	the transfers were as requested and the driver very competent and friendly . if you ' re looking to arrange your own transfer i would heartily_recommend these_people .

2	if you want to take the hassle out of looking for car parking the use these_people their website is easy to use and gives you all the options_available at the airport you are going to . i will dfinitely use their site again .
2	i have used holiday_autos for many_years and have always been very satisfied .
2	but this year one of their rental providers ripped me off with this new fuel_policy that some are using .
2	instead of returning the fuel_tank full they now want it returned empty and then to charge you way over the odds for a full_tank .
2	they said they were going to charge my credit_card 00euros but the bill came through a few weeks_later as 00euros .
2	the tank size was only 00 litres !
2	so they basically charged me double .
2	if that ’_s not a scam then i don_’_t know what is !
2	returning a car with no fuel is a horrible experience .
2	i got lost driving around lisbon and the fuel_gauge went to zero .
2	it was a very stressful last day of my holiday and left me feeling very bitter about the car_hire experience .
2	unless holiday_autos start indicating which cars are from a fuel scam provider before i book , then i won_’_t be using them again .
2	have used this company twice - with deliveries going to opposite_ends of the country - both deliveries arrived promptly ( within two or three_days ) and i have no issues with using the company again .
2	ordered a cycling cap from the site , delivered within stated delivery time and good communication
2	well since my last review ive got 0 more guns from them , wow , the service i recieve is great the courier always calls me to say when he will call , and when that time is due he is there ,, all i can say is i dont believe all i read but this company has not let_me down , great
2	ive been with vodaphone for years , cant_fault them , always great for me , ive recommended people to the company they love it as well as i do , .
2	james
2	fantastic .
2	let_me tell you why , i ordered the dj tech express , it arrived great on time , but it didnt work , to cut a long_story_short , another was delivered within the week , fantastic company , dont hesitate to buy from .

2	i placed my order around lunchtime and it arrived by 00 :_00am the next_day .

2	fantastic company , 0_star_rating not high enough
2	i was glad i contacted age_partnership i didnt understand anything about pensions but on speaking with james wadsworth he explained everything to me and also got me an increase in my pension and although he was always professional it was like speaking to a friend and if i can i would like to thoughrly reccomend this company
2	000000
2	i had had my phone for three years and assumed that it would be of no value .
2	i as pleasantly_surprised to find that it was worth quite a lot of money and the process of quotation , despatch and being paid was very smooth .
2	a great experience which i would_gladly repeat in future .
2	i bought a bouquet for my mother on mothers_day and it was delivered on time and was simply amazing .
2	the flowers were fresh and the scent from the hyacinths was fantastic .
2	my mother had so many flowers she filled two vases and was over the moon with the quality .
2	thank_you serenata - having been disappointed with other delivery companies i will be using you again so long as the quality and value for money is maintained .
2	well_done .
2	great price , excellent aftersales and great delivery .
2	what more can i say - used before , will use again .
2	ordered limited_edition cd pack and a bunch of vinyl_releases .
2	as always they were quickly shipped , and the transaction was simple and painless .
2	juno is my first_port of call for all my music .
2	i purchased a hotbox shilton 0 . 0kw electric greenhouse_heater from greenhouse_warehouse and put it in our greenhouse on a low setting .
2	when the weather got colder we started to get regular power outages in the house where the main rcd in our fusebox was tripping out .
2	after investigation i found that it was the heater causing this .
2	what was happening was that a fine , metallic dust was coming off of the element when in use .
2	this dust , being metallic , was getting on the power contacts in the unit and causing an earth loop tripping the rcd .
2	the amount of powder was a lot .
2	my electrician told me that is unit was dangerous as the dust , being conducting could be lethal if it got wet ( it was laying all over the floor ) and was stepped on .
2	given than the user of this greenhouse is my 00 year_old mother - in - law , who would never have seen the powder , the potential of this to be dangerous is huge !
2	i contacted greenhouse_warehouse as soon as we realised what the problem was , but its been a month and still no reply .
2	i '_m very unhappy with both the product itself ( it being potentially lethal ) and the post sales support from greenhouse_warehouse .
2	if they read this i would be very happy to ( finally ) hear from them .
2	cant be_beaten .
2	i can get chocolate_bars here than you just can get without going to multiple shops - and sometimes not even then !
2	avoid this company if you ever expect to get any kind of after sales support !
2	i ordered and had delivered a very expensive garden set of furniture .
2	unfortunately , two of the threaded bars that fix the legs to the table were of the wrong_size - i reported this to them and was told by email that i would get a call on the 00th to arrange replacement parts .
2	after chasing by email ( multiples times ) and attempting to chase by phone ( you go into a 00 min wait in a paid for 0000 number to still get no reply ) and via their own contact form on the website , i still , as of this time ( 00 : 00 on the 00th ) have had no call or email from them to sort_out this problem .
2	made worse by the fact that the only reason we ordered from them was the quick delivery as we had guests for last weekend , who ended_up sitting on the chairs ( which were pre_- built ) looking at an un - assembled table with their lunches on their laps - thanks for a ruined weekend worldstores !
2	so i '_ve had to wait for days with still no resolution and with a decent weekend coming up will have to spend it looking at the uneless pile of aluminium and wood on my patio .
2	worldstores make even bt '_s customer_support look professional and that '_s saying something !
2	as above .
2	no_complaints and would recommend to anyone_needing any type of cable .
2	interparcel is ideal for us as we send a number of small shipments both within the eec and outside .
2	we need to get a price quickly so we can quote our customer by return and intreparcel enables us to do this .
2	it is swift simple and easy to use .
2	suits our every need
2	i placed an order on 0rd february .
2	arrived 00 days_later .
2	the item was faulty .
2	have emailed them and recieved no response .
2	they knew the item was faulty before they sent it , they just sent it anyway .
2	£_00 down .
2	save your money and find a decent company to buy from .
2	be warned - if something isn_'_t right the company won_'_t entertain you and you will lose your money !
2	!
2	i ordered my transporter through mark ashman of swiss_vans .
2	i can '_t fault the way i '_ve been dealt_with , it '_s been first_class .
2	i was told the van would be with me in eight_weeks and it was , to the day .
2	the price i paid was the most competitive around and everything run_smoothly .
2	would i buy from them again or recommend a friend ?
2	yes 000_%, thanks mark and swiss_vans .
2	after much research , i place a query on the pc_specialist forum as to what i wanted from my pc i orderd the spec pc that had been suggested to me with a slight modification , i added some extra usb_ports and a graphics_card instead of the integrated card suggested and still kept the price down to my target figure of £_000 .
2	arrived right on time , it was dispatched on the bank_holiday saturday and arrived wednesday_morning , well_packaged .
2	i was kept well informed as to the progress of my order through all_stages right up to dispatch . due to family commitments i was unable to set it up for 0 days , set_up went like a dream its been running now 0 days with no_problems at all .
2	i would throughly_recommend pc_specialists
2	can say nothing good about them .
2	quick , easy .
2	does what it says on the tin !
2	fantastis offers and discounts , delivery could and should be faster .
2	but disc more than make up for it !
2	!
2	head and shoulders_above the rest when it comes to prices paid for second_hand equipment .
2	easy to use process for obtaining quotation ; equipment collected from my front_door , payment made promptly .
2	will_definitely use again .

2	what can i say " fantastic - thank_you ""
2	we were having some problems both with our cpe for braodband - and our it service providers responsiveness .
2	we narrowed_down the problem to the router , and when i called jon at broadbandbuyer , and told_him what we had , what issues we were facing and asked - wht should we buy - the reccomendation was instant .
2	within 00_minutes , the transaction was done , and the router arrived the next_day .
2	it '_s in and working and all our instability issues are resolved .
2	as a small company - getting help when you really need it matters - and the team at broadbandbuyer were excellent !
2	i broke a pair of well loved and long held designer framed glasses , and after_contacting my insurance company to be told that i had an excess and an awkward process to get them replaced , i contact0ed glasses_direct .
2	i had 0 different frames on home_trial delivered within 0 days , had returned them after another two , and my glasses were then on the way .
2	all in all from the day i broke them , to the day i had them replaced - it was two_weeks - and not only did i get one pair - i got two for what my excess was going to cost me , and had none of the hassle .
2	glasses_direct - in my opinion - the best way to buy glasses !!
2	!
2	i purchased icage downlighters from this company .

2	staff were proactive in ensuring my order was dispatched for next_day delivery .
2	the order always comes quickly , well_wrapped and all products are of a high_standard .
2	prices are competative and as a member the free_postage is a bonus .
2	we ordered new toilet_seats from splashdirect .
2	they are of an excellent quality less_than half the price of the equivalent product in the major_diy retailers .
2	the products were dispatched quickly and arrived wihtin one day , which was quicker thna indicated on the website .
2	they were well_packed so that they arrived without_any damage .
2	i would nothesitate to order form this company agian and have already_recomended them to family and friends .
2	thank_you excellent service it was here in two_days from the order being placed on line .
2	product itself is of a high_standard and excellent value .
2	we received an email in the morning saying our item was out for delivery that day , and on checking the tracking it was showing it as on the van out for delivery .
2	so , i waited in expecting to see the item sometime that day .
2	after wasting a whole day waiting for this delivery i checked the tracking again and there was a note saying it had been returned to the service centre at 0 . 00 despite supposedly being_able to deliver up to 0pm .
2	imagine our dismay the next_day when we again checked the tracking and an additional line had been put in before the line about its return to the service centre saying " could not gain_access at 0 . 00am ".
2	what an utter lie - our place is so easily_accessible its not true .
2	shocking duisgusting behaviour to just lie about a non attempted delivery .
2	we have had yodel deliver to us on many occassions without a problem so why was this so difficult ???
2	.... and to then lie is outrageous and totally_unacceptable !!!!
2	we are so angry about this we will take it up with customer_services and complaints_dept tomorrow !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2	!
2	ordered one day arrived next_day , about sums it up really .
2	great price and great service .

2	after_contacting age_partnership i was pleasantly_surprised how well they responded to my enquiry . i was given consultation on what to do but was allowed to have time to make my decisions without being forced to respond quickly .
2	chelsea simpson kept me informed at all times and answered all my questions frankly and informantly . she was polite . friendly and knowledegeable without high pressure_selling . there was a follow_up to ensure that even the transfer had taken place correctly . thank_you
2	i would recommend them to other people .

2	having bought many electrical items from high_street providers like comet ( rip ) and currys we have bought a whirlpool dishwasher on line previously from a different supplier which only lasted two years and was not very practical .
2	we had replaced that with a second_hand bosch_dishwasher which was excellent even_though it looked tatty , we therefore wanted another bosch machine for that purpose , we have recently_bought a large larder_fridge on - line and had some issues with the provider which were resolved eventually to our satisfaction but could have done without the headaches it caused initially with missed delivery dates , even_though we were in and expecting them .
2	appliances on - line impressed us with the high_quality and quantity of the positive_feedback on its very user_friendly website .
2	we found the video_demonstration really helpful in allowing us to make an informed_decision with regard to the capabilities of the two items which we bought which were a bosch_dishwasher and an lg 0kg direct drive washing_machine .
2	both were delivered extremely efficiently with plenty of updates to keep you informed of when the delivery was arriving so you would not waste your day .
2	the delivery team were very helpful and took away much of the packaging , my only_criticism is the £_00 charge for the taking away of the old machines - currys do not charge for this service and even give you a trade in of £_00 against the dishwasher , however as we wanted both machines to arrive at the same time we went with appliances on - line .
2	both my wife and i are really happy with the items and the excellent customer service , thank_you for restoring our faith in ordering on - line .
2	because we have been so pleased with our previous experience with ao , we elected to purchase our replacement tumble_dryer with them and again all praise to them for the efficiency of choosing on line , with the easy ordering and the very efficient delivery , thank_you to ao , excellent on all counts .
2	would still recommend them to others .
2	from the sending of my old glasses to the putting in of new lenses , the service and communication was first_class .
2	thanks .
2	i was impressed at the speed of service and the quality of the glasses , so much , that i bought another pair and am looking_forward to them arriving soon .
2	didn_'_t know the width between my eyes ( because opticians don_'_t put it on the prescription ) and used the standard width .
2	perfect choice and am wearing them now as i type .
2	i have already_recommended this company to my friends and family .
2	keep_up the good work !
2	:-_d
2	this parking reservation was made very easily and was very smooth in operation .
2	it was great to get into the short_stay_parking for the same price as the long_stay .
2	there were no_complications .
2	as i arrived , i took my ticket from the barrier , which had noted my registration_number and then i inserted my ticket upon leaving .
2	after about 0 or 0 successive sony_ericsson phones i decided to give htc a go as at the time sony did not have an android phone , i had the htc magic , it was very good no_problems at all and exceeded_expectations .
2	when my contract was up for renewal , i decided to go back to my old favourite sony_ericsson in am shocked , what was once a reliable brand seems to have gone down_hill , i have had nothing but problems with my se phone since the start both software and the case cracking for no apparent_reason one more than 0 occasion despite going back for an updated case .
2	it looks_like the newcomers have overtaken the old guard in the phone market and i shall definately have them at the top of my upgrade list .
2	i just wish phones would stop getting bigger each year
2	i '_m always amazed at the amount of movie and tv information imdb has if you need to know anything about a tv show movie or actor this must be the first_port of call .
2	bought a used car from stratstone saab birmingham just before_christmas , were fine until i paid then just seem not to be_bothered and just wanted to usher me out of showroom as soon as possible , i was told when purchasing from them that missing owners_manual and details of warranty would follow in the post , the dealer closed not long after this but stratstones were very quick in sending a letter telling_me which other of their dealers i could visit to get my car serviced , repaired etc , but i never recieved the promised items in the post , so i emailed them , after a couple of days i got a reply saying they would look in to it and asking for further information and stating that their finance manager was at stratstone saab that day so would chase it up .
2	since then despite several emails to the person_who responded to me and via their website i have heard_nothing from them at all .
2	a bit_strange since one of the items i was missing was details of an extended_warranty that i was looking to take out with them .
2	i know the car i purchased wasn_'_t a £_00k range_rover or jaguar ( it was only £ 0000 ) but surely every customer should be treated fairly .
2	i will think_twice about setting_foot in a stratstone or evans_halshaw dealership again .
2	btw the car i purchased has also developed a fault since purchase it looks_like the dual mass flywheel is failing and according to people who i have spoken to this would have been noticeable at a service ( which was supposedly done just before i picked_up the vehicle )
2	i have so little faith in stratstones that i would rather pay to get this fixed myself than bother trying to claim on the 0 month_warranty given as i was told this was very basic and didn_'_t cover much and the limit on it was £_000 being as the repair will be more than double this i ' d rather go_elsewhere with my custom .
2	i was impressed with the help from customer_services before i placed my order - they were courteous and knew their products well .
2	the camera came very speedily from_hong_kong ( indeed quicker_than click and collect from my local tesco would have been !)
2	dhl have an excellent tracking service , so you can see your order all the way and you know when to be in the house to receive delivery .
2	the camera was well - wrapped and protected with bubble_wrap .
2	i will be using digitalrev .
2	for all my photographic purchases from now on .
2	well_done !
2	an excellent service .
2	an easy to use website and lots of choice
2	bought two_pairs at a super price .
2	they arrived when expected and are of good quality .
2	a great site with lots of lovely items at great prices .
2	i have purchased two_pairs of glasses from speckyfoureyes . com .
2	the web - site was easy to use and paying on - line was also easy and trustworthy .
2	a query to their support_team was answered_promptly and professionally .
2	the glasses arrived within a few_days , and i '_m very pleased with them .
2	all this at a fantastic low price !
2	i recommended speckyfoureyes . com !

2	i purchased a hp_printer from a competitor to printerland for about the same price as i just purchased the lexmark_x000 from printerland .
2	the competitor was paid for 00 - 00 hour delivery and it turned_up 0_weeks_later - and it was the wrong product .
2	the product was returned .
2	then i found printerland !
2	the product they offered was at an outstanding price .
2	( are these_people crazy ?)
2	they promised next_day delivery .
2	order was placed funds sent 0000 on monday .
2	product delievered in good order around lunchtime the next_day - all 00_kg of it .
2	this really is tremendous service .
2	their telephone ordering was easy and smooth with a well spoken native_english_speaker ( lisa ).
2	the followup correspondence was accurate and timely and delivery was as advertised and on time .
2	i would have absolutely no_hesitation in referring you to this company - really simple as that .
2	i belong to the photobox " insider '_s club " - no strings that i can see , only some excellent if sporadic offers .
2	one of these was for a hundred page a0 photo - book at a fraction of its normal coast , so i decided to indulge .
2	this you do by buying credits , which have a certain expiry_date - so that '_s your deadline for upload , choice and design .
2	the results were splendid and the procedure had been trouble - free .
2	a slight_gripe is that occasionally photobox versions of images which had areas of natural dinginess or shadow do seem to lose significant luminosity and detail in those parts .
2	there '_s a marginal tendency to muddiness .
2	now , all my work is checked and corrected so that a full range of tones is present on everything i make , and i don_'_t think the problem is at my end .
2	but it '_s possible that as much lustre might be lost by other printers as a natural casualty of the transfer process from screen to paper .
2	you have to accept a huge loss of contrast and dynamic range , just as you always did , and from the year dot .
2	the fact is that nine out of ten prints were excellent : the book itself was well - made and a joy to view and hold .
2	i won_'_t deny that the photobox website has a couple of idiosyncrasies , pretty well like any website in the world ; and that these have to be learnt .
2	but the staff are so eager to help that guidance through every_step is only a phone_call away .
2	very rarely , yes , photobox is known to make a blooper .
2	( i once received some giant prints of an unknown baby .)
2	but in nineteen cases out of twenty : if you know your own craft and you don_'_t expect the superhuman , this is a firm which is sure to deliver .
2	and if in doubt , pick_up that phone ?
2	this is a great little gadget , much more fun than a helicopter .
2	so_far i have only flown it indoors but will venture outside when the weather is calm .
2	it '_s easy to fly , taking just a few flights to get the hang of basic control with more advanced controls all ready to be used as your skill level increases .
2	battery_life is good , spare_parts are available at a reasonable price .
2	i ' d certainly recommend the x0 to anyone that '_s into radio control gadgets .
2	i ordered a custom_built computer on christmas_eve , and my computer was delivered on 00th_december , despite the holiday_period , and up and running within minutes of arriving .
2	staff at ginger0 contacted me to inform_me of the dispatch and the time of delivery .
2	excellent service .
2	my custom computer ordered from ginger0 is a far higher_spec than products to be found in local computer shops but with a comparable price making it a very good deal and i have got what i need for my next three years of computing .
2	i am a very satisfied customer .
2	very happy with both the service and the flowers .
2	i was kept_fully_informed about the delivery which arrived promptly .
2	the flowers were as_described on the website and very fresh - the lilys were delivered unopened and have now started to reveal themselves 0 - 0 days after delivery .
2	very satisfied and would definitely use again - highly_recommended .
2	virgin_media , the company that suddenly offeres cheap deals to people when i used to pay thru the roof for half bit 0mb bb service with no sky_tv_channels .
2	the ic and tv connection kept disconnecting every 00_minutes and caused no end of headaches , plus the callcentres in india do not help .
2	they never fixed the probelm after 0 weks and 0 engineers and i will never use them again .
2	i was on telewest for 00 years and had excellent service but overpriced !
2	then virgin step in and we lose sky_tv and we get v + box with 0 hd channel - bbc hd !
2	i vcannit stress enough how bad an experience they provided , thank_god for sky .
2	they have been no problem .
2	play are competitive but are slow on the sending out of goods , never expect a product if preordered to arrive on release day !
2	this is play '_s fault .
2	free delivery fine , game etc do the same butt game send out 0 days beforew at 0st_class , whereas play send out 0 days before and we still dont get it for 0 - 0_weeks !
2	be prepared to wait for goods off play , at_least 0 - 0_weeks .
2	i have used o0 home bb for 0 - 0 years_now and find their serice to be impeccable .
2	really excellent service and well recommended .
2	amazon i find excelent for oyther services , goods and appliances particulary .
2	their book service is slow as slow can be but the ir other products i find fast dispatch and very good quality .
2	shopto , net provide a speedy and cheap service for the avid video gamer .
2	a cheap , competitively_priced site on products which no one else appears to beat .
2	really good efficient dispatch service as well .
2	recommend retailer .
2	i recently_purchased a registration_plate through national numbers .
2	they had identified that the number was being offered at dvla auction .
2	they made contact with me , suggested an appropriate bid limit and managed the bidding process at the auction .
2	i am_delighted , having secured the number well within the pre_- agreed bid limit .
2	i doubt that i would have achieved such a great deal without their expertise .
2	i had experienced serious problems with the company that was originally contracted to deliver my goods .
2	uk mail was used to provide me with repolacement items by the seller and i was very pleased with the result .
2	i will use uk mail wnehever i can .
2	a simple on line transaction that occurred without problem and delivered my requirements in a timely_manner
2	this was a very straightforward process indeed .
2	it was easy to order what i wanted and the website have lots of information about the product .
2	the delivery was prompt and on time and the quality of the bath and bathroom_furniture i bought was very good ( the opinion of my bathroom_fitter ).
2	the one reservation is that the furniture does not come with adjustable legs which makes the installation more complicated .
2	it would be easier to deal with 000vet if they accepted scanned copies of prescriptions by e_- mail , which some other_suppliers are doing now .
2	instead you have to post the prescription to them and wait for as long as it takes for the prescription to arrive before they send out the medication .
2	this was a flawless process , with the sandals being delivered promptly and at a very reasonable price .
2	i would happily use taunton_leisure again .
2	i ordered a 00kg_bag of iams cat_food last_week taking_advantage of an excellent 00_%_off deal .
2	it was ordered online and the item was delivered the next_day .
2	very impressive service and there was no delivery charge either !
2	i only live 0 miles from their shop but it made sense for the item to be delivered with that deal .
2	after a trawl of the high_street and main pc web sites i could not find a lap - top spec ' ed to my liking without a load of unwanted extras ( what does a business need with a touch_screen ).
2	through a web search i found pcspecialist .
2	using their mid - fast - build option i ordered the exact pc i wanted and less_than week_later it was deliver to my office .
2	absolutely everything i needed and wanted , worked first time out of the box , delivered ahead of time and within my original budget with no compromises made .
2	i am_delighted and will be buying all company and personal computers from pcspecialist in the future .
2	light_bulb for my cooker i found it difficult to locate .
2	even with easter in the middle only took three_days to get my order .
2	great service at a great price for products that are genuinely difficult to find .
2	i have been a customer of heinnie_haynes for many_years_now .
2	they are my first_port of call for birthday and christmas_presents mainly for my male relatives and friends .
2	but also was a superb source of the necessary kit for my eldest daughters gap year in the wilds of asia .
2	i have bought over fifty items from heinnie_haynes and never had any kind of problem .
2	i am a big user of ebay but find that for the overall balance of guaranteed delivery , quality , reliability and price i get a better deal from hh .
2	when you buy kit for the great outdoors you really need to know that it will work when needed .
2	it was getting too expensive to feed the birds until we discovered titmus .
2	good prices and very quick delivery
2	just what i was looking for .
2	good price , qhick delivery
2	the guy in the shop gave_us good advice .
2	unlike many discount stores , the brands on sale were good quality .
2	we picked the mattress we wanted , and it arrived dead on time a couple of days_later .
2	excellent service .
2	i had al ; ready bought from another site , before i came_across animed .
2	that site turned_out to be based outside uk , never asked for a prescription , and took_ages top deliver .
2	no such problems with animed , who were cheaper as well .
2	excellent !
2	good , quick delivery .
2	reliable service .
2	recommended by a friend many_years_ago .
2	first place i check and repeatedly used .
2	can '_t fault there helpfulness , they contacted me , after " i " made a mistake to ensure i was sorted_out , happy with my deal and cleared an admin_charge .
2	will_continue to be a customer and would recommend for sure .
2	exactly_what i wanted , arrived very quickly , good price , what more can they do .
2	would contact & purchase from again .
2	have purchased several_times from battery_force and will again .
2	next_day delivery to northern_ireland
2	competitive_prices
2	very informative / comparative web_site for your choice
2	of quantity or quality and easy to use .
2	extensive variety
2	i ordered my product on 0st january , and was advised it would be delivered on 0th_january .
2	i then received a text 0rd_january , to say the item was dispached
2	and confirmed delivery to me 0th_january .
2	00 : 00 0th , january , parcel_force delivered my order ,
2	well_protected and just as i had asked for .
2	thank_you gear 0 music , very satisfied customer , shall_certainly
2	recommend for many reasons .
2	ordered a pair of shoes which i would of thought would of been new .
2	to my disappointment the one shoe was new - the other shoe looks_like it was over 00 months old and been in their shop .
2	be careful - although the items may be in the sale they may not be 0000 saleable .
2	disappointed !
2	i ordered a belt for my dyson_vacuum_cleaner and it arrived first thing in the following_morning , with a free pen and fridge_magnet to remind me where to go in the future .
2	i will_defiantly be recommended these_guys to my friends .
2	fab website , fab prices and fab service
2	recieved goods next_day - fantasric
2	here '_s a big warning not to use rentalcars . com .
2	we pre_- paid £_00 . 00 for 0 days rental .
2	we took all the documentation that rentalcars . com told us to , including driver '_s licence and credit_card .
2	when we turned_up , the company would not rent us the car because we didn_'_t have a second part of of our driver '_s licence .
2	rentalcars . com never mentioned this .
2	we had to get a taxi because we couldn_'_t get a rental car .
2	not only did rentalcars . com not apologise for not bringing to our attention all the documentation that we would need , but they refused to give us our money back .
2	the rental_agreement was never fulfilled .
2	it cost rentalcars . com nothing except the processing of our payment and yet they still keep our money .
2	they have a specific paragraph in their terms stating " where the vehicle cannot be picked_up due to insufficient documentation ... this will be treated as a cancellation ... a 000_% cancellation_fee will be charged where we are not notified of cancellation prior to the start of the rental ."
2	they must have had numerous customers not know that there are two parts to a uk licence that they need to take to the rental company and yet they do not bring this to the attention of their customers .
2	why would they have that paragraph about a 000_% cancellation_fee in there terms of agreement ?
2	easy money for them ?
2	do you know of any other company that charges a 000_% cancellation_fee ?
2	yes its a good honest service does exzackly what it says as i said used this for the second time now no problem at all with the service good all - round would recommend to any one
2	quick , easy and efficient - will_definitely use again !
2	fast delivery and great service as usual .
2	because they stock good gear at good prices and they deliver quick , i did have a problem 0_weeks_ago when suddenly the item i wanted next week would be delivered in a month , but i rang them up and spoke to a really helpful chap_who helped_me select an_alternative and sorted it out , they were also very helpful when i realized i had missed 0 items off my order and despatched them at no extra_charge .
2	just had another order delivered , arrived in 0 days ( this week )
2	they are really nice helpful people on the help lines
2	told buy this rubbish company to basically go away .
2	dont wish any bad on some people but go_bust your rubbish ...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2	!
2	purchased ajax tickets and was gutted to find out after spending money on flights and hotel to find the tickets were fake and lost a lot of money ..!!!
2	thanks for nothing ..... dont trust this lot .....£ 0000 up in smoke , can '_t began to tell you how bad i feel , just put it down to experience .
2	as i proceeded the system logged me out , when i got back in everything was still there except free delivery had been changed to £_00 . 00 next_day delivery , extra .
2	took a long time to get the system to change this back to 0 - day free delivery .
2	almost gave up ....
2	recently_purchased an item from toolstop , would highly_recommend these to everybody wishing to purchase tools .

2	ordered a new pair of oakley_sunglasses at a very good price , placed order tuesday received on the thursday saved £_00 on recommended price .

2	these_people are worth six_stars they know what customer service is all about , ordered the watch on friday_afternoon & it was delivered saturday_morning , i even received a phone_call sat evening asking did i get the watch & was all ok , the watch is excellent it '_s for my wife xmas_present .
2	craig jones ( northants )
2	integrity and efficient
2	excellent service , delivered quicker_than_expected .
2	will defendant lay use them again and would thoroughly_recommend them .
2	well_done merlin_cycles .
2	found 000 via_google , best price for " advocate ", i have 0 working gundogs , so buying from them rather_than my local_vet saves money even after paying for a prescription .
2	better price than uk , delivered quickly and safely without hassle .
2	now looking_forward to taking some great portraits .
2	rack is just what i was looking for , and was easy to assemble .
2	delivery time fantastic - ordered one day , delivered the next .
2	two petzyl head torches ordered as presents , arrived in record time .
2	reward_points system means i might be able to buy one for myself !
2	i have been reluctant to write a poor review about this company , because i was sure they would resolve my problems .
2	i believed the customer service centre , when they told me numerous_times , how sorry they were for not replying and that they have once again forwarded my request for refund , to the accounts_department .
2	i had returned two_separate_packages of ink_cartridges for refund , because they refused to be accepted by my printers .
2	no problem with that , these things_happen .
2	i just wanted a refund , i could then decide if i would order some more from a different batch .
2	i did not receive any acknowledgement of receipt , i had to email several_times to find out if they had been received .
2	no problem , we have received them and a refund is on it '_s way .
2	more emails sent , eventually i got a refund for one of the packages , i don_'_t know which one , they were both the same price .
2	many more emails sent and assurances that the remaining refund would arrive soon .
2	now despite getting the automated_reply , and then a read receipt for my emails , no one will reply .
2	this has taken over a month and still not resolved .
2	so i guess the answer is yes , i am gullible to believe that this company are professional and honest .

2	i cant rate bella_barista highly_enough , i called them on friday_evening not noticing the time , in fact it was later than i thought and certainly past bb '_s closing hours .
2	however my call was taken and although the person_who picked_up didn_'_t have the information on the machine i was enquiring_about she did say someone would call back .
2	by now i had realised the time and assumed i would hear nothing more until monday ... then the phone rang and it was rodney from bb , he was extremely_helpful and far from tying to get me off the phone he took time to talk me through all the options , then ( unlike most ) he told me to take my time and think it over over the weekend , indeed he was taking home one of the machines i was interested in and would let_me know his assessment on monday .
2	one the monday i spoke with claudette and again we discussed the option , i decided to buy a quickmill verona and placed my order .
2	the opportunity to collect my new machine came up so on the wednesday i visited bella_barista and again nothing was to much_trouble .
2	i was taken through a practical demonstration to aloud to try all the machines i had been interested in , the experience was fantastic and confirmed that the verona ( a machine bella_barista had a great deal of input into the development of ) was the best machine for my requirements .
2	it is worth_noting that i was willing to spend over twice what i eventually spent but claudette and rodney were only interested in selling me the right machine not the most expensive !
2	in summary , if you are looking to buy a great espresso_machine from one of the very best retailers in the industry , look no further ... buy online with confidence better still go and see them you will not be disappointed .
2	the team helped_me to chose the best item for my requirements .
2	shipment was fast and we '_ll packed .
2	i would certainly use pleasance_& harper again .
2	i dealt_with david , he was polite and extremely_helpful .
2	he called back when he said he would , and ensured my boots arrived very quickly in perfect_condition .
2	my only regret is that as end seems to be aimed_at " trendy young things ", in my late 00 '_s i may not have the opportunity to buy from you too often ;-).
2	thank_you !
2	my experience is similar to many others here , place order , money taken , thats the last i heard from them !
2	the very few positive_reviews on this site indicate a company trying but failing to offer customer service , if you are lucky_enough to order something de cuisine have in stock then i am sure they will send it .
2	however in most_cases your money will be taken and that is the last you will see of it .
2	please , if you happen to hit the jackpot and are among the chosen few who do get what you ordered , do not recommend this company to friends , yours was an_isolated transaction your friends will lose money , if in any doubt or subscribe to the conspiracy theorists , contact devon trading_standards or your credit_card company they will know de cuisine , you have been_warned !
2	healthy_supplies makes it easy order really good products from the comfort of your warm dry home .
2	the range of products tempts you to try ingredients you might not normally think of , especially if you have just seen a great recipe on the telly and you are not going anywhere_near a shop for days .
2	iv ' e never been disappointed with the service , and the packaging is always excellent , with prompt delivery .
2	give it a try !
2	!
2	hi , just wanted to let you know of a great site for worktops .
2	i purchased a solid_wood one in caramelised bamboo .
2	i have to say it looks fantastic .
2	the service was also excellent , very quick and superbly_packed . i would have no_hesitation in recommending this firm .
2	buying the travel_insurance for my 00 year_old daughter was very simple and quick ; the cover is clearly_explained and the premium is amazing !
2	good tele_sales - helpful and informative - delivery on time and in good order .
2	quick shipment and seller always kept you informed .
2	outstanding .

2	sadly , the last time i used herbert woods , the handover of the boat was sadly_lacking and we were late setting off .
2	my party had arrived early and did not_necessarily expect to take the boat early , but it was already moored and available for any maintenance .
2	we completed the necessary_paperwork and went off for lunch and a pint .
2	on our return there was limited work being carried_out on the vessel , but that dragged on way past the appointed handover time , and with no direct communication from anyone about what the problem was .
2	this was late october and it was nearly dark before we got away , severely restricting our activities that day .
2	otherwise , things went pretty_much smoothly and we enjoyed our late break on the broads .
2	however , with the increasing prices , i really do expect the vessel to be ready on time .
2	i ordered a couple of bottles of torres 00 , my favourite brandy , and the experience was satisfactory , more or less as i would have expected .
2	nothing outstanding , either good or bad really .
2	the package was delivered by parcelforce and they allegedly have a tracking_system , which rarely told me anything more than ' in progress ', but it was delivered in around the timescale i would expect
2	i ordered tickets to a boxing event weeks_ago and paid in full up front .
2	i have been waiting ever_since and twice queried where my tickets are .
2	they tell_lies and say that the promoter has not released them .
2	i know they have cos i know loads of people who have had their tickets in hand for ages .
2	the status of my tickets has_been showing as ' prepared for dispatch ' for about a week now .
2	i cannot fathom how long it takes these useless numpties to put 0 tickets in an envelope with my name and address on ?
2	would never use them again no matter what .
2	i would rather miss the event altogether than use eventim . co . uk
2	the initial experience was more than acceptable , with next_day delivery .
2	however , if you wish to return items , as i did , the nightmare begins .
2	there is entirely inadequate arrangements for the return of items , lack of communication by all concerned and incompetence on a level which is more or less prevalent wherever you go these days , but nonetheless unacceptable .
2	this has caused me so much stress and is still not yet resolved , two_weeks after i requested the return .
2	i am also nearly_£_00 out of pocket on the deal
2	i wanted to point out as a matter of feedback that a karcher_window cleaner should not be sold the way you sell it .
2	i bought the cleaner from you and paid for delivery . having read the instructions i saw that you had to buy cleaning_fluid to use the machine and it could not be used with any other products . your website should be designed offering the detergent as an optional_extra and it was ridiculous having paid for delivery that i then had to go to the store to buy the cleaning_fluid . the operator kept on repeating the same information as_opposed to taking it on board and advising your buyers and website .
2	the gilet was the best i had seen and as looks can be deceiving i waited_until making an opinion until i had received the gilet .
2	i am_glad to say it was better_than the photo and fitted well .
2	i was worried having bought a bed in france that it would be difficult to arrange transport .
2	i did have 0 calls to other_companies most of them did not even come_back to me shiply made the whole_experience easy .
2	item arrived promptly and well_packaged
2	goods were delivered the very next_day well_packaged .
2	beautiful ladies business case
2	speedy reliable service as always
2	quick in receiving ordered specs .
2	will_definitely use again .
2	thanks .
2	i ` ve been with selectspecs for a number of years , they are very reliable and their spectacles are very good value for money .
2	designer_frames are glazed in this country and budget in hong_kong but they only take about a week to come_back .
2	i can thoroughly_recommend this compay .
2	i '_ve_used many earplugs over the years and these are by far the best .
2	excellent sound - blocking , comfortable and long - lasting .
2	easy to use web_site , very fast delivery , convenient , tasty_food , easly cooked , long life on packet .
2	ideal for a quick meal when out sailing .
2	excellent service everything_went through fine , really pleased with the cards .
2	this is the 0 rd time i have used them and will again soon .
2	good website easy to use , found the item i was looking for straight_away with no_hassle ,
2	ordering and delivery was excellent , i was kept_informed of my orderes progress at all_stages right up to the exact hour it was to be delivered to my door .
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending this company and i will_certainly use them again .
2	easy site to use my design cane exactly as i had planned & the order was dispatched very promptly .
2	excellent service thank_you .
2	very fast delivery , excellent catalogue and web_site have used them regularly and never_experienced any difficulties only first_class service every time .
2	never had such a good shave and never too old to start .
2	i have got the works razor , brush , mixing bowl that looks_like a presentation bowl , could not be more satisfied i cannot wait for my next shave .
2	expensive but you only get what you pay for highly_recommended .
2	also got the head shaver and that has_been marvellous .
2	excellent customer service ordered friday arrived following_tuesday .
2	keeped me informed up to the earphones arriving . i have had trouble in the past getting plugs to fit without coming out these seem to fit the bill cant_wait to use them later at the gym
2	as ever my experience with blackcircles was simple and straight_forward to the point that i don_'_t need to know the specification of my tyres .
2	the system pulls it from your vrn , how good is that .
2	even better a guy phones and asks whether the selection i made i knew that they were not the recommended tyres whilst my car was in warranty .
2	fortunately , i was out of warranty and i was assured that my selection was still a premium selection at a good price so happy days .
2	the ability to select a fitting_centre near to home or work is really convenient also .
2	i would recommend them to you .
2	i received my itams and the batterie on one did not work and the atamizers were faulty i have emailed three or four times but did not get a reply and i even rang but waited 00 min but got no reply so very disapointed indeed i will wait and see if i get a reply to this email ..
2	excellent , knowledgable , polite and helpful service .
2	i would certainly use again .
2	inexpensive access to leading operators - this time p and o .
2	their website was easy to navigate and didn_'_t make claims or offers that didn_'_t exist - unlike wholly unreliable operators and agents such as myferry .
2	i had no_hesitation in using ferrysavers this time and shall inevitably using them again in the near_future .
2	they left a note yesterday , didn_'_t turn_up as promised today .
2	different_stories from different " customer service " representatives .
2	i have no idea if and when the package will ever turn_up .
2	the second rep i spoke to told me categorically that yodel has no press office - i asked because i write for several magazines on consumer matters such as this .
2	he told me that someone would phone back about my complaint .
2	nobody did .
2	i have since emailed their online publicised press office but don_'_t expect to hear back .
2	it is shocking that companies such as this are entirely unaccountable to the general_public .
2	wouldn_'_t hesitate to recommend rawlins_paints .
2	easy to order , their 0 - 0 day delivery arrived the very next_day and the product is fantastic , does_exactly_what i hoped for following the advice of their technical_department .
2	a refreshing_change !
2	excellent service ... and speedy
2	wanted some hdmi_leads and found these .
2	very happy with the quality although i '_m not an expert and wouldn_'_t know the difference_between economy and top_notch leads .
2	extremely good service .
2	will use cpc again .
2	thanks
2	bosch pmf 000e all_rounder 0 in 0 multi_tool cuts - saws - sands 000w 000v .
2	brilliant product and a very good price for a bosch .
2	i bought this to replace a lidl ' parkside ' brand , which broke after only using it three_times .
2	twice the price of the lidl one but you get what you pay for .
2	i normally try to buy bosch power_tools if they ' re on offer and i can_afford them .
2	good bit of kit !!

2	order for refund , 0nd payment charge , 00 / 00 /_0000 ,
2	they owe me two payments for none delivery of goods , poor service from india
2	put you on hold at your cost and failed to deal with the refund .
2	very poor service and overlay charged to be put on hold and not dealt_with .
2	called karcher head_office received a good reply ,
2	but no real help in the matter .
2	no better deal than shop deals ,
2	better to buy in a good shop with good customer service .
2	ordered this item from my home in north_east and sent it to sister in yorkshire , was delivered next working day after may bank_holiday , very good delivery and best price for dualit food_mixer , will recommend the service to friends and family .

2	love_em
2	have been using them for a year having got fed_up with wasting so much time with the waitrose website .
2	great service and seem to be a company with a big desire to be sucessful .
2	good quality produce at a good price .
2	after over 000 transactions i '_ve stopped using ebay .
2	it was once a place for a bargain or a niche product , now it '_s full of traders , used products cannot properly be separated from new ones in the search and you are forced to have a paypal_account .
2	new auction_sites are springing up , se of which are totally free to use .
2	once a great place to shop but amazon is now my first_port of call .
2	order confirmation was immediate , delivery confirmation was within the hour , package arrived the following_day free of charge .
2	easy to buy and check out and a great price .
2	i '_m picky at the best of times but cannot find anything to criticise about the goods or the services that i received .
2	i ordered a camera kit and extra lens .
2	the price was excellent , delivery was about 0 week from when i placed my order and it was fully_trackable via_dhl .
2	all in all , what more could you want .
2	came_across this site looking for best price on a fuji xe - 0 digital_camera got the kit version with 00mm - 00mm zoom_lens for £_000 , took a chance & used bank_transfer to save £_00 extra so £_000 , compared to best price in uk £ 0000 , service was exceptional kept_informed & delivered & tracked with ups in 0 days
2	saved £ 0 on one purchase of advantage_flea_treatment , fast free delivery what more could you want
2	very competitive_prices & great delivery service , we will be back
2	ordered online only £ 0 - 00 more than my best quote elsewhere , had confirmation phone_call same day & another call 00_minutes before fitter arrived , friendly efficient service & confirmed pressure i wanted , so much_better_than my last visit to kwik_fit centre , will use again without_hesitation
2	i have been using interparcel for about 0 years in business & privately , they have never_let_me down always on time i always choose ups as preferred courier & they too are amazing polite helpful drivers , try them for yourself next time you want a reliable service
2	purchased a sony cf_card_reader , top quality product at a great price
2	just perfect
2	great price and service , i am impressed .
2	i will use digitalrev again .
2	i usually visit subway outlets whenever i go to london .
2	i like subway sandwiches but they are overpriced .
2	i still prefer visiting subway for their quality of food and good service .
2	' what a great service , ordered on 0st november delivered on the 0nd all i
2	did was quote the model number they did the rest , sending the correct item
2	which is of good quality at great price .
2	with their instructions it was
2	fitted and up and running in minutes great service would recommend .'
2	great , just great !
2	the item i bought is the original yves st laurent ' pour_homme ' which i have used for years .
2	i have found it really difficult to obtain over the years ( for that very reason ), and even if i did , the price was extortionate ( debenham '_s for instance ).
2	i found perfume_click by_accident and am overjoyed
2	they will be my shop always now .
2	dealchecker is named appropriately .
2	it gives a selection of all the best deals including special flight offers directly to your computer - hot off the press , and on a very regular_basis .
2	i wouldn_'_t attempt to consider a holiday without first consulting dealchecker .
2	i have found them to be invaluable in the past and for me and my wife ( as pensioners on fixed incomes ) an_absolute must .
2	the title_says it .
2	relates to purchase of a lg dishwasher .
2	best price available on the internet , free delivery , on time delivery , took the old one away free , kept me informed .
2	there '_s not much more you can ask for .
2	highly_recommended
2	i ordered a watch on a thursday_afternoon .
2	i received an email on friday_morning confirming that it was in transit from the dealer in switzerland .
2	i received another email on monday saying that it had arrived , had been inspected and was on its way to me .
2	it was delivered tuesday_morning .
2	exceptional customer service .
2	i also saved nearly_£_000 vs the high_street in the process .
2	how good is that ?
2	internal letter_box cover .
2	no issues .
2	good quality and promptly delivered at a competitive price
2	ordered a a boot_mat on 00th_november_0000 .
2	still_waiting for delivery on 00rd_december_0000 despite 00 ( ten ) phone_calls to the company .
2	a different_story every time and not one promise kept .
2	i am starting to wonder seriously if this is a scam .
2	update , it is now 00 january but still no boot_mat .
2	colin at mrcarmats promised me a refund and claims that it went through at one minute past ten on 0th_january .
2	of course it has not arrived .
2	telephone_call count now at 00 .
2	avoid this company all they do is take your money .
2	refund finally received at the end of january , so not a scam but seriously bad service .
2	the best time that you won_'_t remember !
2	very organised , safe and professional company - we '_ve been on 0 stags this year ( budapest and prague ) and pissup have ticked all the boxes both_times - by no means limited to stag parties either !
2	matt , london
2	booked a hotel through this company .
2	a few_days_later i discovered that the price i was paying was actually billed in pounds , not euros .
2	ok , this was my mistake .
2	however , when i wrote to them explaining this fact , it was too late because their price guarantee only lasts 00 hour !
2	absolutely_useless .
2	i tried to explain to their head_office that i could easily cancel the booking without_any charge and book with hotels . com and save myself at_least £_00 .
2	but they just didn_'_t care because 00_hours had lapsed .
2	either that or they did not understand because they are based in spain .
2	i wish i ' d booked with hotels . com because their price guarantee lasts right up to the hotel '_s cancellation window .
2	brilliant !
2	not only that , i can '_t even log in to their system to view my booking !
2	i will never use hotelopia again .
2	i recently_purchased a new chainset .
2	twenty_minutes after_placing the order my chainset had been prepared for shipping and was ready to be dispatched .
2	it arrived_safely the next_morning .
2	merlin_cycles are usually the most competitive when it comes to pricing , and they are very efficient at processing my orders too - which is good when you ' re as impatient as i am .
2	almost every order i '_ve made has arrived the next working day .
2	i would highly_recommend them and suggest you check their website the next time you need something for your bike - you '_ll be very pleasantly_surprised at how much you '_ll save .
2	excellent priced tyres , quickly fitted and even a free car wash .
2	i have great confidence in this garage - wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else - it '_s rare to find places that you can trust especially after previous_experiences with the so called ' tyre fast fit outlets ' - i now avoid them like the plague .
2	websites very easy and straight_forward .
2	will use again
2	i spoke to duane johnson from uswitch for 00_minutes who explained everything and helped_me to sign a new plan saving me a considerable_amount of money .
2	yes i have passed your details to a friend of mine who is a developer
2	this was my second purchase from tyreleader .
2	when i bought my first lot of tyres i was a little_concerned of buying from a non uk source .
2	but i needn_'_t have worried !
2	so much so that i have now used them a second time without worry .
2	tyres came very quickly .
2	competetive price .
2	will use again .
2	would definitely recommend .
2	ps would it be possible to liaise with the courier more easily to vary delivery time please ?
2	first_class service .
2	easy to communicate with .
2	very quick_turnaround of order .
2	best price on the internet ..... keep it that way and i '_ll certainly use you again .
2	fair price , prompt delivery
2	correct order arrived when they said it would .
2	would recomend and use again .
2	this is my second puchase from gjwtitmuss and i will_continue to use them .
2	the seed arrived when it should have , it was correct , what more could you want ?
2	do not book with credit_card , you will be surcharged and they don_'_t tell you until after the booking is confirmed .
2	this is devious , and i won_'_t use this company again .
2	i always come_back to order from this website , much_cheaper_than the high_street and nearly always cheaper_than other online competitors .
2	fast delivery at free or low postage_costs .
2	i can highly_recommend this company .
2	always a pleasure to order from .
2	i had a difficult problem to solve regarding proof of postage the parcel was delivered super_fast but i need proof of postage for ebay regarding a return , [_name_] was straight on the case , and resolved the matter in a couple of minutes , ( big relief ) would recommend using parcels0go great value for money and everything is so easy to do .
2	customer service is excellent .
2	cheers [_name_] !!!
2	!
2	as soon as i placed my order i had a call to warn of a possible delay then another call the next_day to let_me know my order would in fact arrive on time .
2	polite , informative and efficient .
2	the website gave_me all the information needed to make a decision .
2	price keen .
2	delivery pretty rapid , on promised date and with good information with a pleasant delivery man .
2	everything_went_smoothly and the product was delivered by 0am on the promised day .
2	i also had plenty of updates advising of order status
2	tried to buy jewellery at end of nov .
2	paid by paypal and credit_card debited immediately .
2	nothing arrived .
2	e_mail and answer machine correspondence repeatedly went_unanswered .
2	we reported this to paypal who investigated and luckily for us have refunded the money .
2	useless waste of time
2	i needed to buy a new toner for my home laser .
2	i came_across printerland after surfing and found trustpilot too .
2	i read the reviews and decided to look at the website .
2	the website was very clear and easy to use .
2	even better they had some amazing deals on there in_conjunction with manufacturers .
2	instead of a new toner_cartridge i have a brand_new printer , with 0 years warranty , and once the samsung cashback arrives , for little more than i had to spend for the cartridge alone for my previous printer !
2	delivery and communication has_been firstclass .
2	i will be using them as preferred_supplier as long as tehy keep_up these standards .
2	well_done !
2	like many others i have used ct for years_now - shoes , shirts , jackets , trousers are always excellently made and good value , especially on their specials .
2	have never had anything but excellent service including on international transactions in different currencies
2	your customer_services_department has just lost you a customer for good .
2	as an individual and on behalf of 0 gp surgeries i have purchased ‘ 000 ’_s of pounds worth of goods from you over the past years .
2	i have 0 x_0gb dim0 ram - bought as pair .
2	0 has_been crashing my computer with memory malfunction .
2	i have run memory tests on the individual units and identified that one is faulty .
2	you state that i have to return the pair - which means i will not be able to use my computer . i would have purchased another set from you and would willing have done this for a credit reimbursement when the defective pair had been returned .
2	e buyer refused - just wanted me to end up with 0 x_0gb_ram which i dont want or need .
2	i will now purchase something from elsewhere and then return your defective item as apair as requested .
2	you are in breach of the sales of good act through the unnecessary significant inconvenience_caused entirely by your application of a silly policy .
2	under the sale of goods_act , the retailer must either repair or replace the goods ' within a reasonable time but without causing significant inconvenience '.
2	i ordered a very cheap 00 string_guitar and expected it to be pretty_useless .
2	what a surprise .......... a very nice looking guitar , sounds really good , took it to the acoustic night at my local_pub and the other players were impressed .
2	it did not get lost in the background , sounded clear and loud , held in tune , no_problems .
2	do i expect it to last ?
2	if it last for a year i '_ll be happy as i now know i like playing 00 string_guitar .
2	arrived quickly , i tuned it up to pitch , one string broke , i contacted them and they sent me a new set of strings immediately .
2	i have bought a double_bass from them and had good support with the few problems i experienced .
2	will use them again definately .
2	i '_ll shop_here again , choice , quality kit and good service .
2	price was the best i could_find .
2	order shipped next_day via_dpd who delivered next_day at time stated .
2	i ordered a tap and within minutes of getting a dispatch email from the seller , dpd had sent an email with the delivery details and link to track or amend my delivery .
2	this morning i had an email when i checked my mail to say delivery was 0 . 00 to 00 . 00 .
2	delivery driver dave turned_up at 0 . 00 with the parcel and a cheery smile despite the heavy_rain .
2	can '_t fault this service especially compared to some other delivery companies .
2	i purchased some new megaman leds which the very helpful operator price matched against another internet site .
2	bulbs were shipped promptly and full tracking_details sent .
2	parcel arrived next_day .
2	genuine product as_opposed to one or two other_sites i looked at .
2	price was excellent .
2	i was phoned to check delivery date and access was ok then texts on the day plus a call from the driver to confirn he was near .
2	i also had two email afterwards for cashback claims .
2	that '_s the sort of service i like .
2	good cashback_rates and fast resolution of any missing cashback .
2	purchased a brass dual hose connector as it was the cheapest on the web .
2	it arrived next_day and is of excellent quality .
2	bought two michelin primacy 0 tyres , which few places stocked , at best price around .
2	fitted at one of their premier partners who were quick and friendly .
2	very professional work .
2	first_class top shop
2	the price .... excellent
2	the product .... exactly_what was ordered .
2	product quality .... excellent
2	instructions for installation .... clear & concise
2	delivery .... prompt & traceable .
2	why can '_t bigger companies with loads more money & staff be this efficient & value for money ??
2	well_done mr_memory !
2	!
2	fast delivery and best price on the net - unless you want to risk second user !!
2	!
2	searched through google for my item - ark pets had the best price and free delivery for my purchase .
2	ordered thursday arrived friday .
2	brill
2	place your order , then sit_back and take delivery [ next_day in my case ].
2	simple to order and fast delivery , keep_up the great work .
2	at first i thought it is not true .
2	very good and cheap remittance options .
2	not much to say really - works_perfectly , simple , quick , easy , great communication and very quick_turnaround .
2	wish they would do it for more items and i could de - clutter !
2	this is about as good as it gets .
2	the quickest , best , most customer_focused website i '_ve come_across .
2	does_exactly_what it says on the tin .
2	this boot_liner fits my seat_ibiza st like a glove and stops my golden labradors fur sticking everywhere .
2	i was worried i would get a generic liner that would also fit the similar skoda_fabia , that has a slightly_different boot shape , but it is tailor_made to fit my car .
2	the quality is great , but getting the adhesive velcro to stick is a challenge .
2	maybe bmb could provide a small tin of silicone remover to encourage correct application ?
2	i bought some grubs wellingtons and needed them quickly .
2	i spoke to the sales_team and they arranged a 0 day service at no extra_charge .
2	the goods actually arrived the following_day .
2	the only down_side is the boots , which i have had before were really uncomfortable to wear and gave_me blisters , so i feel like i have wasted my money .
2	but this is not the fault of the shipping company .
2	my pens arrived very quickly , despite been ordered over the christmas_break .
2	i have used cult_pens before and highly_recommend them .
2	the national_tyres site is easy to use and appears to offer a greater selection of tyres than other national_chains .
2	i was actually happy with the price quoted for 0 dunlop_tyres only to be left with a sour_taste after clicking the accept customer survey button after making my purchase .
2	i was offered a £_00 off thank_you voucher off my next purchase !!!
2	as if i am going to buy more tyres or an exhaust in the near_future .
2	why can '_t they take it off the price i have already paid for my tyres ?
2	in my opinion it is a very empty thank_you and left me feeling out of pocket .
2	best not offer anything at all !
2	i have used myhermes to ship my parcels 0 times and each time they were collected by a freindly courier on the stated day and delivered 0 days after collection .
2	she has also collected my parcels from a nominated safe_place on one occasion , so i didn_'_t have to wait around all day .
2	a000 % hit rate with 000_% satisfaction .
2	as always a great product from those who know how and where to find them !
2	saved us a packet on the student office pro version .
2	the most difficult part was getting the login_details sorted for the uni systems so we could get the license_key !!
2	!
2	lol
2	thanks studentcomputers .
2	used morecomputers several_times .
2	always reliable , huge_selection of products for every need and at prices that are rarely_beaten elsewhere .
2	highly_recommended
2	this is the second time i have ordered livestock from charterhouse .
2	every critter in perfect_condition , snails , crabs , nudibranchs .
2	all properly packaged , delivered next_day as promised .
2	order included 0 small berghia nudibrabchs .
2	separately bagged and all active .
2	placed them in a container to begin acclimatisation to my water .
2	snipped off the heads of two small aiptasias and put them in .
2	the nudibranchs immediately sensed their presence and within 0 minutes had started feeding .
2	couldn_'_t ask for better_than that .
2	quality products , great prices , quality courier , rapid delivery .
2	corrective lenses fitted to my mask at no extra_cost with originals neatly replaced in the boxes .
2	forgot to mention about the lenses on my order so sent an e_- mail late that evening requesting they be fitted .
2	whole order was despatched next_morning but not before i ' d had a response confirming the lenses would be fitted .
2	courier has on - line tracking and even gave a 0 hour time_slot for delivery .
2	outstanding .
2	always efficient and reliable .
2	i have had 0 orders with this company going back about three years .
2	only on one occasion have i had any problem .
2	they had forgotten to pack a tripod i had ordered with several other items .
2	one quick call to a friendly support guy and the missing tripod was on its way , with an_apology for the inconvenience .
2	given that it arrived only two_days after the original package ( 0 days after order ) i can '_t say it was much of an issue to me , but still the firm treated it seriously and quickly corrected its oversight .
2	i have no_qualms ordering from this company .
2	quality outfit
2	the company provides a bewildering range of headphones but has filters and provides detailed_information to help you make the right choice .
2	i ordered after 0pm on thursday .
2	my postie delivered them at 00 . 00am today ( saturday ).
2	that means a ) the phones were actually in stock , b ) the company processed my order promptly and efficiently and c ) they offer only reliable carriers .
2	the headphones ( audiotechnica ath_- ad000 - which after only one hour of listening i '_m happy to confirm are properly under the ' audiophile ' filter ) were well_packaged and protected and the box included a few nice extra touches .
2	i won_'_t say what , you '_ll have to place an order yourself and find out .
2	but i had an extra little grin on my face that hasn_'_t worn off yet .
2	i have seen cheaper prices , but not by much , and none of them provide the same range , information and quality of service from selection to delivery .
2	the range of contact options provided give me little cause to doubt that any required after sales support will be there if i need it .
2	if you want a quality experience and excellent value for money then you really need to use hifiheadphones .
2	good purchasing process and prompt delivery .
2	when we had a problem with a product it was replaced straightaway with no need to return the original !
2	thanks carl .
2	i would give lower if possible .
2	ordered a sink they delivered an_alternative without telling_me .
2	the one delivered was £_000 cheaper and they didnt tell me .
2	0_weeks_later i am still_waiting for them to collect it and refund my money .
2	the above opinion sums up my experience of ao , i will_certainly use them again
2	i have been a weber user for more than 00 years and used several suppliers during those years but non approach the level of knowledge and customer service that riverside_garden_centre provide , outstanding in everyway .
2	thank_you riverside
2	duncan davis
2	comprehensive , jargon free help providing a full solution to the problem .
2	what more can you ask for !
2	highly_recommended .
2	very quickly delivered .
2	not all the photos i ' d uploaded were printed on the card , there were a number of duplicates also .
2	slightly_disappointed with this , although appearance and quality of the card is very good .
2	sound considering size of speaker is impressive .
2	pairs easily via bluetooth .
2	service from superfi was first_class .
2	great set of speakers at a great price .
2	next_day delivery .
2	sound from cyrus 0 dac and cd - t is wonderful .
2	radiator well priced and delivered within days of order .
2	great product and price .
2	ordered 0 pm on tuesday , delivered lunch time wednesday .
2	found jacket at a reasonable price , when everywhere_else was sold out .
2	ordered on saturday arrived thursday_lunchtime , as advised .
2	price was fantastic , £_00 cheaper_than on amazon .
2	always good service and fair prices .
2	couldn_'_t do without .
2	been a customer of g0m for many_years during which time i have purchased guitars , leads , mixers , keyboards and many other music_related items , the service use to be a good one - hence my remaining a loyal_customer , as of late i have found the service to be slipping .
2	october_0000 , i contacted them about a guitar i was interested in and brought to their attention that it was £_00 more_expensive on their site than other music stores on the web , on the plus_side they reduced the price to bring it inline with the other stores i had seen it advertised on , i ordered the guitar ....... on opening the packagaing found the inner foam protective bag ripped and holed , on taking the guitar out found the protective_film on the pickups missing , body and headstock dirty and covered in fingermarks and dust , no protective_film on the scratchplate , and chips out of the paintwork .
2	having contacted them , they offered a further discount and apologised for the state in which it was sent out .
2	november 00th 0000 : placed an order for a number of items all of which were in stock , on taking delivery and checking the packaging found that they had sent a wrong item , so contacted them .... was told they would post a replacement out the same day ( this was on a thursday ) having not recieved the item in question on monday 00th contacted them again , said there had been a delay of 0 day and i should recieve it by wednesday 00st nov by 0nd_class post - how many websites offering goods for sale use 0nd_class postage ?????
2	?
2	00th_november finally recieved an email from g0m stating i would recieve the item wednesday ............... wouldn_'_t mind so much but at the time of ordering they had 000 of the item i wanted in stock - its taken 0 days to post out something that should have been with me in one .
2	this is not the first time i have been sent wrong items , recieved goods in a second rate manner ( dirty and marked ), have suggested on each_occasion for them to have a word with the warehouse staff who do the picking .
2	on - line chat with " stephanie " to sort_out a documentation problem .
2	promptly answered and sorted_out .
2	super !
2	from first enquiry to delivery , gary at toneworld has_been unfailingly cheerful , patient , positive and helpful .
2	my amp was ordered on wednesday , delivered on thursday and worked straight from the box .
2	( probably because it is a box ...) my halfwitted queries about problems with leads and strange buzzing noises were answered within hours if not minutes .
2	what more can i say ?
2	' i shall definitely be using them again ' hardly seems adequate , especially as i have now run out of money .
2	but when i get some more , i will be back , i promise .
2	excellent service and customer_relations .
2	i had a problem with an item and it was replaced immediately without_prompting .
2	superfast delivery as well on both_occasions
2	faultless
2	bought a pair of mephisto shark sandals , must be the best

2	rented a car to be collected at innsbruck airport .
2	on arrival , no queue , representative was efficient , spoke perfect english .
2	car was upgraded free , brand_new and spotless .
2	in short the simplest and best hire transaction i have ever_encountered .
2	everything about my interaction with this company was flawless .
2	i explained what i wanted on the phone , there was no pushy_sales_technique , just polite advice .
2	a delivery date was promised , communications on delivery were terrific , delivery was exactly on time .
2	wow , just a perfect service .
2	and what i bought was simply exquisite as promised .
2	thanks guys , i '_ll be back .
2	dyson actually searched around the internet for a part for me , called me to say there was a part in stock at espares . co . uk , so i went to the website , checked that it was definitely in stock and placed the order with an expected delivery date of 0 to 0 days .
2	two_weeks_later , i call them ( note , not the other way round ), only to be told that suddenly the part is out of stock , that someone must have coincidentally ordered the same ( very rare ) part at exactly the same time .
2	the guy on the phone told me i didn_'_t understand how stock worked , but if he knew what i did for a living , he ' d be embarressed .
2	so how long would they have left it before calling me and offering to return my money ?
2	do i believe the coincidence of someone biuying the same part a nano second before me ?
2	meanwhile , espares . co . uk have had my money in their possession , all be it a small_amount , but if this happens to many people , that can add up .
2	was the part really , truly , in stock when i ordered .
2	doesn_'_t smell good , so won_'_t be ordering from them ever again .
2	i am pleased to say that my experience so_far has_been that interparcel has_been exceptionally good at delivering any thing i have sold on ebay and needed delivering quickly and efficiantlly .
2	thankyou interpacel .
2	regards_dave s
2	great company , good product and speedy delivery .

2	highly_recommended .
2	esay to order , desriptions are accurate , delivery on the date stated .
2	i have taken four flights last_year with ryanair , two to portugal from doncaster and two to dublin from birmingham .
2	the two to doncaster were perfect , great staff i got what i paid for .
2	the two to dublin were never again to be repeated i will fly with air lingus from now on .
2	ordered on christmas_eve and arrived on the 00st .
2	a tracking_number was supplied , could not ask for better service .
2	the north_face coat i ordered arrived in first_class condition .
2	i would recommend this company to anyone and will_certainly be using them again myself .
2	facewest do what they say on the tin .
2	item - suunto_core watch - purchased at a very competitive price and while the delivery took a few_days , it did arrive within the given period .
2	scumbag company as many other_reviewers have said .
2	i '_ve been unable to obtain a refund for a cancelled order and have been palmed off with " we are processing your refund " e_- mails from someone called leslie grant .
2	looks_like i '_ll have to write this one off as a bad_experience - the first time i '_ve had any_problems buying online .
2	the company does not have a postal_address ( because it is clearly not a uk company ) and its customer_services are a sham .
2	don_'_t buy !
2	!
2	first time i ` ve bought from the game collection and all has_gone well for my 0st purchase .
2	i `_m_sure i `_ll buy some more games soon .
2	i hunted high and low for the cheapest price for dogrocks and animed was the cheapest by far ... will buy from this company again .
2	for the second time i '_ve had the same problem with yodel , after 0 delivery attempts i waited in all day today for them to make the 0rd .
2	at about 0pm i decided to look at the tracking_info and it had been returned to the service centre after a failed 0rd_attempt !!
2	categorically no attempt was made and no card was left !!
2	after trying to sort it out with customer_services i just got fobbed_off with with " we have made 0 attempts so i will now have to collect " !
2	!
2	that would be a 00 mile_round_trip !!
2	as with all the other comments , avoid this company at all costs .
2	i will be complaining to amazon us who the parcel is from , to make them aware of what happens when they send a package to the uk .
2	yodel are ****!
2	!
2	recently_bought a set of taylor made irons was given fantastic trade in on my callaway_irons .
2	have bought from company before for balls , shoes , electric_trolley all value for money .
2	will always be the first place i will go for anything in futcher
2	excellent friendly customer service and very competitive_prices .
2	we have used this company 0 times now and have received an exellent service every time .
2	there are no_hidden_extras and nothing to pay other than what is highlighted at the booking stage .
2	this is the second time i have purchased a watch from watchfinder .
2	this one was an omega_planet_ocean and was exactly as advertised .
2	watchfinder will always be my first choice for checking stock when i have the bug to buy another .... from actually talking to one of the staff on the phone to the watch arriving i cannot_fault them at all .
2	the delivery was quick and the watch arrived very well_packed and safe .
2	my only ' complaint ' is that i '_ve got no willpower and every time i get an e_mail from them i start looking again and want to buy another one !!!!
2	!
2	thanks again .
2	this is the first time i used viovet .
2	the price was good and the p_&_p a lot less_than some others on the web .
2	plus i paid via_paypal which was really simple .
2	it arrived next_morning .
2	i couldn_'_t fault the product or service and will use again .
2	these boss yellow refils are a great money saver and the service from cultpens ( strange name ) is excellent
2	i knew that mobilefun was not the cheapest for my first blackberry - but i also knew that if the phone was to be reliably delivered in the short time frame i had before i went back to the continent , this was the place to go .
2	i was not disappointed .
2	the website is well_organised and quick .
2	this is without_any doubt the best company and website available .
2	you simply will not have any_problems with this company from_start to finish .
2	the selection , quality , quantity , price and service are absolutely second to none .
2	buy with confidence guaranteed .
2	looked at what i wanted , found good selection and picked the one wanted along with other items and placed the order and got all the items next_day with no_problems .
2	being buying from them for a long time .
2	no_hassle outfit .
2	thank .
2	the product ordered was at the best price .
2	and the delivery was prompt .
2	would order again as the stock on offer good .
2	ordered flowers in good time for delivery for valentines_day , only to be let_down big time by inter_flora got email_stating due to high_volume of orders they were unable to fill my order .... i will never use this company again and advise anyone_else not to
2	ganes was £ 0 . 00 cheaper_than anywhere_else and was delivered with in 00_hours ... will use again .... great all_round service
2	ordered items from this company , waited a week then was told item out of stock after i called them , but was told would be in stock with in 0 days and order would completed , waited another week still no item , called them again only to be told item still out of stock but would be in that day .
2	another week has_gone past and still nothing called a third time and told no sure on when stock would be in .
2	total_waste of time and although item cheaper_than else where i would rather pay the extra and get items delivered with in a week not 0 plus weeks .
2	will never use this site again and would advise others to avoid like the plague
2	having just bought a new car ( new to me ) money was low .
2	unfortunately it needed two new tyres .
2	i checked online for prices at all the regular suppliers and was a bit horrified at some of the prices .
2	i then came_across the etyres site .
2	not only were the tyres really good prices but each was graded ( i think i '_m right in saying ) by an independent body .
2	i bought the tyres online and arranged for a mobile fitter to come .
2	without dragging it out too much - the fitter arrived on time was polite and quite chatty ( unlike many tyres outlets you go to where you are either treated_like a moron or have the proverbial extracted by the fitters .
2	i asked for the new tyres to go on the front which meant swapping all the wheels around .
2	the fitter quite happily obliged and was extremely competent and professional .
2	in the days since fitting the tyres have performed very well .
2	really pleased with etyres ... i will be using them again in the future .
2	items received very quickly , secure and very well_packed .
2	all items exactly as_described and at a great price .
2	really impressed , cheers .
2	its like an industrial argos .... everything you could need for storage under one roof .
2	wanted to get the mercury v0 following on line review and ideally in " sugar maple ".
2	my local hi -_fi retailer could potentially have got them in a weeks time but .... hifix had them
2	0 ) in stock
2	0 ) at the same price as my local retailer
2	0 ) with free delivery .
2	excellent item and service .... many_thanks
2	shocking customer service .
2	i have been unable to access my online talktalk account for over a month despite_numerous_emails & phone_calls .
2	if your looking for a service provider i would strongly_urge you to look_elsewhere !
2	purchased a vehicle workshop_manual online download .
2	it was supplied in some unknown format for which you are then pointed towards a further software download in order to make it work , this software then will not load properly and i am still left with a product i can not use .
2	i would steer_well clear of this company .
2	ordered my giffgaff simcard put it into my smart phone , purchased £_00 top up credit and a £_00 goodybag which gave_me unlimited_internet , unlimited_texts , and god_knows_how many free phonecalls for a month .
2	the first 0 days i checked my account balance , it was still £_00 all well and good showing all calls i made were coming from the £_00 goodybag add on just as they should .
2	all of a sudden 0st august , balance dropped to £ 0 , i contacted their online help agent who informed me that i dialled a premium number 000000 on 00 july at 00 : 00 & 00 seconds whilst i was in bed and the phone was downstairs with no other person having access to it , this call cost £ 0 .
2	i did not make the call , i have no idea or interest who is on the other end of 000000 , what a con , needless to say once my credit runs out with giffgaff i will be putting another networks simcard in my phone and they won_’_t con any more money out of me .
2	i advise you to beware of this network before your pocket gets hit .
2	if i could give them minus 0_stars i would .
2	i have bought several products from this company and the service has always been good .
2	only had one occasion to contact the company over an order issue and the staff were very friendly and the matter was rectified within 00_hours .
2	_ highly_reccommended .
2	bought tools several_times at machine marts vat free days and look_forward to the next sale .

2	my husband built it very easily and we are buying another soon
2	confusion_over size of bottles but was sorted quickly with aprompt , friendly and helpful reply
2	i ordered a deal through wowcher and it didn_'_t arrive .

2	i wanted an oil and filter_change , entered reg_number and got quote .
2	i couldn_'_t even buy the oil from my local factors for the price of the job .
2	no_brainer
2	totally_satisfied with deepblue , i have ordered a number of items of dive_equipment during the last four years and have no_compaints about the service , the equipment , or the response from the crew of deepblue .

2	i telephoned to ask for advice on fit and was able to have an in depth conversation on my requirements and which models would give me the best fit , .
2	i ordered the glasses on monday_lunchtime and they were with me by tuesday_lunchtime .
2	the glasses are first_rate and fit_perfectly .
2	this is possibly the best service i '_ve ever had online
2	i ordered a us postal kit bag on sunday_afternoon .
2	it was delivered on tuesday_morning .
2	great price and prompt serrvice .
2	what '_s not to like !

2	they were easy to design with the online templates and with the clear_instructions fitted within a few hours .
2	the look is professional and in one afternoon had five complimentary comments from potential_customers .
2	i was particularly_impressed with the sales_teams ability to turn a couple of minor problems into a positive customer experience - that is a very rare_thing now days - thanks martin and russell ,
2	i have been so impressed i am about to order some matching polo_shirts .
2	try the online design system , you will be impressed .
2	good pictures , good explanation of what will be received , good extra add - on advice , speedy delivery , overall a very good service .
2	i have used emirates_holidays on many occasions and the product has normally been perfect .
2	in jan_0000 i used emirate holidays to book a flight and hotel package .
2	the booking agent was very knowledgeable and helped with selection of hotel .
2	dubai has hundreds of quality hotels and the ones that emirate holidays have on there web_site represents the best ones to suit all price points .
2	i have stayed in around 00 hotels in dubai over the last ten_years and the selection we made on this occasion was as good as i could of expected .
2	i did have issues with the service and the food on the aircraft , the 000 out of glasgow , the evening flight .
2	however i could only recommend emirates_holidays for there service and knowledge of the product .
2	regards
2	steven fyfe
2	everything described perfeclly and super_fast delivery , can '_t really ask more than that can you ?
2	i would say that i ' d use again but i '_m really hoping that this won_'_t be an ongoing injury .
2	i purchased a pure_theatre projector_lift to flush mount in the ceiling of my home .
2	i coupled this up with a motorosised projector_screen .
2	both products look great finisied in white .
2	installation was very easy and the finished product looks great , works very well and is perfect for my needs .
2	i would definitelt recommend these units to anyone looking for a quality product .

2	will_definitely use again .
2	well_chuffed with the optoma hdlv 00 projector .
2	came exactly as it said it would .
2	great selection of designer names and frames .
2	stock is always changing .
2	i '_ve been buying from them for a good few_years_now and recommend toni & guy opticians to all my friends .
2	ordering specs online without trying them on first was novel but i '_ve had no_problems_whatsoever .
2	the various guides like the one on measuring for frames are really helpful .
2	i '_ve been to the store a few_times and it '_s a sea of smiles and great customer service - they are a great company !
2	keep_up the great service .
2	just purchased a 00inch toshiba which is fabulous , matching the service and delivery supplied by crampton_& moore .
2	what with price match and a confirmed delivery date to suit me who could ask for more , the couriers kept me in touch on the day of delivery even down to a 00 minute warning when arriving .
2	good service is unusual in these days but this was outstanding .
2	well_done to all and thank_you .

2	i have just bought a canon_0d mk0 from igadgit , and couldn_'_t be_happier with the price and excellent service .
2	it took me a long time to summon up the courage to spend nearly_£ 0000 with a company over the internet , but boy am i glad that i did .
2	i made several anxious phone_calls before i finally decided to go for it - all my calls were handled in a friendly and efficient manner , and if the receptionist said that the customer_services manager ( graham ) would call back , he did .
2	the product arrived really quickly , and they even put in a blower brush and cleaning_kit as an unexpected_bonus !
2	with full uk warranty for 0 year and a price at_least £_000 cheaper_than calumet or john_lewis , why would i go_anywhere_else ?
2	i will always check igadjit before anyone_else from now on .
2	i am a very satisfied customer .
2	you always worry when you buy online with a company .
2	this company was superb in all departments , great value , great service , great communications too .
2	many_thanks to sammie for helping_me get a delivery rebooked in .
2	excellent service via live_chat .
2	glenn reeve
2	always reliable and top quality
2	spoke with agent richard , who sorted my issue straight_away , very impressed
2	faultless service , very helpful , excellent communications .
2	nothing too much_trouble .
2	tyres ( pirelli p0000 ) are really good .
2	tyre price good too .
2	the garage was first_class .
2	would use again
2	issue due to non collection by courier dealt_with professionally and quickly by ashley ... at xmas 000_% can '_t be expected considering p0g act as agents for so many couriers some good some bad and they take the flak for all of them .
2	used p0g for a long time for our business 00 - 00 parcels a day .
2	very few issues and always dealt_with quickly and compensated .
2	try saying that about some others .
2	highly_recommended
2	just had to comment .
2	i first used this company around 0 years_ago and got great service .
2	used again for a 00gb card and again truly excellent .
2	card arrived on time - bargain price and works 000_%.
2	so ...........
2	i guess either i am a very lucky person or else the company are as good as i think they are .
2	i speak as i find , and find moby_memory ace .
2	very easy to use and select a good courier at a great price
2	happy to do_business with fastlec again
2	site is easy to use , prices very good and delivery excellent ( you can track it ).
2	only issue was it was a little_unclear whether the tyre select meets the homologation for the car being searched for .
2	the tyre model
2	has a suffix for the type of car .
2	anyway i got what i wanted and am happy with the choice
2	very good price ; fast delivery .
2	no issues
2	reasonably_priced , well_packaged and a speedy delivery .
2	i was aware throughout of where my items were .
2	i am extremely happy to give a favourable review , when it is deserved - in this case , it is !
2	goods came well_packaged and in good time .
2	recommended supplier a *!
2	unfortunately , i had a long - awaited hospital_appointment to keep on the date of the autoglass repair so was extremely concerned i would miss it .
2	the guys at the crayford branch were extremely polite and pulled_out all the stops to assist me in making my appointment .
2	thank_you guys for the repair and the assistance !
2	first time i have used outdoorkit - they had the item i wanted at the most competitive price .
2	excellent coms - strikingly fast delivery despite it being the christmas_period .
2	would certainly buy from them again and recommend to friends .
2	i wasnt_sure at first about the site as double0tickets was new to me , but having booked so easily with a really simple website to use , then kept_informed by text that my tickets were on the way i have to say i have found the service first_class !!
2	i will book again !
2	!
2	i have ordered various_types of cables from kenable on a number of occasions .
2	the first time , i was doubtful whether they could really supply cables of good quality at the price advertised .
2	i was stunned at the speed of their service - my first order arrived by post less_than 00_hours after_placing the order - and very pleased indeed with the quality and value of the goods supplied .
2	my subsequent experiences with them have been every bit as good .
2	now , i would not dream of going anywhere_else .
2	this is a genuine review ; i have no connection whatever with kenable ( other than as a satisfied customer ), but if i can help to steer more business in their direction i am happy to do so .
2	agoda is fantastic .
2	the site is really easy to navigate .
2	you get a clear outline of what '_s available and what you will have available .
2	the rates are really competitive and the booking and cancellation processes are absolutely straightforward .
2	a more specific search_facility would make it perfect but its bloody good as it is .
2	unfortunately the descriptions are getting worse , loads of pretty words but trying to find the key information is useless .
2	an example , looking for an insulated screwdriver .
2	so the key points are : screwdriver , insulated , bit type & length .
2	then display the options , i ’_m not worried_about the make , laser tipped etc .
2	the first two options are fine but try finding a specific tip type is not something axminster think you need to worry_about ??????
2	obviously written by someone in an office who just thinks the colour is the most_important feature .
2	had to go_elsewhere .
2	great , will always check for tools .
2	had what i was looking for , at the best price and fast delivery .
2	ace !
2	quick delivery .
2	absolutely fantastic service and value from order to delivery .
2	ordered pair of soundmagic_e00 '_s - performance and sound unbelievable for £_00 !.
2	from order to delivery was two_days and i ordered out of hours at a weekend !
2	i was emailed by the company regarding order progress at_least 0 times for a two day delivery ( standard delivery )!
2	ear_phones arrived extremely well_packaged too !
2	many_thanks , can and will recommend you to all !
2	i have no_hesitation to recommend country_house outdoor and will_definately buy again from this seller .
2	all four cds arrived promptly and in mint_condition .
2	well_done , outdoorkit !!
2	how nice to deal with a helpful prompt on - line company !!
2	i couldn_'_t find a replacement style of salomon trainer that i ' d worn for some time .
2	this was the only outlet that managed to advise me ( thank_you , katie ) that my required style of shoe was now obsolete and which shoe had now replaced it .
2	i ordered the advised style , they were delivered 0 days_later and they were a perfect fit .
2	you are now part of my " favourites " menu !
2	sid
2	dorset
2	i had doubts_about purchasing a " grey_import " but a short email to the game collection followed_by a swift response and equally fast delivery , i am now in possesion of dead_island riptide at a bargain price !
2	well_done chaps , i '_ll be keeping an eye on you .
2	you can view my reviews under webuy . com
2	wecertainlydontcare @ webuy . com would be more appropriate in describing cex
2	gerard corlay
2	how many emails does one have to send to get a reply from cex wecare ??
2	@ webuy take your money quickly . com
2	i was originally very impressed when sending in 00 xbox games for sale and opted for the e_- voucher as i wanted games from their listings .
2	what a lot of hassle trying to reedeem voucher for £_00 . 00 which was posted recorded delvery to their e_- commerce dept .
2	as instructed in their terms & conditions , received and signed for on behalf of cex at 00 . 00am on 00th of feb receipt confirmed by conrad of cex on 00th of feb via_email to myself .
2	to this date 00th of march , my bank has still not received the £_00 . 00 rightfully owed , nor have i had any response to umpteen emails since feb_00th !!
2	!
2	the 0 games i ordered value £_00 . 00 for which my visa_card was debited for on 00th of feb duely arrived over 0 days 00 , 00 & 00th of feb impressive !
2	shame i can '_t say the same about their e_- voucher system and their email repsonses to queries !!
2	!
2	future dealings with webuy . com cex ?
2	lets_see what sort of response , appology , recompense , good old_fashioned customer service i get because at present it looks highly unlikely !
2	g . corlay .
2	( not a happy_bunny )
2	had relply from conrad at cex webuy . com today 00th of march at 0 . 00am
2	quote : we can confirm that we have received the voucher and it will be processed at the earliest .
2	exactly the same as was emailed to me on 00th of feb by the very same person !
2	no mention of other emails sent to them or any kind of definitive answer to the ongoing saga !
2	this kind of " after " sales service is appalling , not to mention illegal and against their owm policies / terms & conditions .
2	shame really because their choice of goods , prices and delveries are amongst the best but oh , the total disrespect to after sales customer service is one , if not , the worst i '_ve ever come_across !
2	!
2	so , after ignoring my other emails in which i mentioned taking_legal_action , i have replied to this latest email from conrad at webuy . com by reitterating this line of action wil proceed as of 0 . 00am tommorow 00th of march if the situation is unresolved by 0 . 00pm today .
2	they have had ample time and had my money for far too long !!
2	!
2	will keep all you other disgruntled viewers updated .
2	latest update 00 . 00pm sunday 00th_march .
2	received further email from conrad at cex wecare ??
2	team today 00 / 00 /_0000 at 00 . 00
2	quote :
2	i apologise for the delay in getting back to you .
2	the voucher refund has_been processed on the 00th of march back to payment_method and you should receive the same within 0 - 0 working_days .
2	now i don_'_t know whether this is a direct result of me theatening legal_action ( appropriate complaint form was already filed with watford trading_standards 00th_march ) or the result of emails sent directly to persons i have been led to believe are directors of cex ( linkedin is a useful website ) whatever , one should not have to resort to such measures if a company wants to retain a loyal_customer base and for them to be successful , that requires a proffesionally run after care customer service dept .
2	which is clearly non_existent in this case !
2	let '_s see if my account is refunded in quote : 0 - 0 working_days from 00th of march .
2	ttfn
2	sorry its been so long for an update but have been unwell ( this case being a contributory factor )
2	i finally received monies_owed on 00th of march but no proper explanation , appology or offer of recompense for all the inconvenience_caused !
2	so you can safely say that i won_'_t be having any further dealings with ( we don_'_t care ) @ webuy . com
2	buyers_beware , if you use this site as the initial service received when purchasing is pretty good but if you have a problem of any sort , its pretty damned ugly !
2	!
2	signing out for good .
2	g . corlay
2	great looking clothing & at good value
2	you must try this website they are great
2	ordered 0 t shirts with my own logo came on reasonable time but !
2	printing out of align sent them back , but due to lack of communication & with no one answering the phone i don_'_t know what the hell is going on .
2	i have made several phone_calls different times of the day & all you get is a answer machine . i have sent several emails no reply its a complete_joke .
2	this was going to be a large order ?
2	i '_ve mad numerous purchases from this retailer and have nothing but praise for the company .
2	the website is a pleasure to use and the service is outstanding , most orders arriving the next working day .
2	my most_recent_purchase turned_out to be defective but hh immediately advised the freepost return address and i received a full_refund within 00_hours of returning the goods .
2	the real_test of any business is how it handles problems such as this and i cannot find any room for criticism .
2	the retailer '_s prompt and efficient service has only reinforced my confidence in the business .
2	buy with confidence !
2	i ordered the watch i wanted from this retailer because the price was reduced by 00_%, making it the best deal available at the time .
2	however , i was delighted to find that the customer service was beyond_reproach .
2	the company promptly acknowledged my order , advising when stock was due and notified delivery details immediately .
2	i was made to feel like a valued_customer and have no_hesitation in recommending this business .
2	i '_ve ordered many * watch_straps / bands from this seller over the years , both direct and via his ebay shop .
2	he stocks a wide_range of high - quality items at good prices and with very reasonable postage rates .
2	he also readily offers postage discounts for multiple_purchases , unlike many other_retailers who have to be prompted .
2	finally , he nearly always posts items the same or next working day to ensure quick delivery .
2	you can buy with 000_% confidence from this seller who has_become my number one choice for watch_straps .
2	* i '_m a bit of a watch enthusiast and own many watches , hence the numerous purchases .
2	i '_ve placed a few orders with cult_pens now and never_fail to be impressed with the company .
2	cult_pens stock the most extensive product range of pens , pencils and associated items i '_ve come_across , all at a fair price .
2	the service is beyond_reproach too .
2	goods invariably arrive the next_day and you always receive friendly , knowledgeable and professional advice if you contact the company with a query .
2	to sum_up , this firm is a pleasure to deal with and one i can recommend wholeheartedly .
2	i recently_purchased a watch and have nothing but praise for this retailer .
2	the title above tells you all you need to know .
2	i '_ll happily buy again from this seller .
2	very pleased with the availability , prices and prompt delivery we have recieved from viovet over the last couple of years .
2	exemplary service .
2	well_done - keep it up .
2	thanks
2	i am a model helicopter freak and i have used banggood for well over a year now and have ordered a countless number of models and spare_parts .
2	they have never_let_me down or sent me the wrong part - and some of these parts are small and fiddly .
2	shipping is free but it can take up to 00 working_days for delivery , but it mostly takes about 00 working_days - remember they come all the way from china .
2	my advice is to order by mid october if you require delivery before_xmas just to be sure .
2	their prices are so cheap and the range of goods is amazing .
2	their flashlights are very good quality and very powerful with rechargeable_batteries , but that '_s only one item out of thousands .
2	take a look at at banggood and you '_ll be really surprised at what '_s on offer .
2	ordered a 00lb digging bar on wed 00 nov_0000 and it was delivered by courier on fri 00 nov .
2	the bar is of very good quality , a good price , really quick delivery and totally fit for the purpose of preparing a post hole to allow me to sink a piece of angle iron into the ground .
2	this is to repair a wooden fence post broken in the recent high_winds ( post was only 0 years old ).
2	rubbish wood but brilliant tooled_- up . com .
2	also the keeping_me informed by email was faultless .
2	thank_you .
2	ordered a ctek mxs 0 . 0 battery_charger on tuesday and it arrived by courier on friday .
2	this is a top_class piece of kit and is highly_rated as one of the best , if not the best , intelligent battery chargers on the market .
2	very pleased with my purchase and this company is first_class and totally_trustworthy .
2	have used nitrotek before and they are first_class and now using them again .
2	the delivery system is super_fast and really efficient .
2	they offer the best prices by far .
2	order no .
2	000000000
2	this is a first_class company with a very wide_array of buckles and belts and a wide_range of other items also .
2	i ordered a belt and buckle on friday 00 july_0000 and my order arrived on monday 00 july_0000 by royal_mail , and securely_packaged in a jiffy_bag .
2	my belt and buckle were of good quality and look great .
2	also the company keeps you up - to - date by email at each_stage of delivery .
2	this company is totally professional and trustworthy , you wont_regret using them .
2	never order from this company , you will not receive your goods .
2	i ordered two t shirts on 00 . 00 . 0000 and have not received them at time of writing this review - 00 . 00 . 0000 .
2	there is no telephone_number to speak to anybody and i have sent three emails asking where my goods are and no reply .
2	i have sent a recorded delivery letter to their wakefield address asking for the goods or my monies reimbursed , but still no response .
2	they only conned £_00 . 00 out of me but i am still pursuing them through trading_standards .
2	annoyingly i failed to read the reviews on this website relating to argoth before ordering , but you live and learn !
2	!
2	if anyone was looking for a fancy_dress outfit i would fully recommend mega_fancy_dress for choice , and value for money .
2	i wanted to purchase a new rolex_explorer ii for my birthday .
2	i live_abroad and explored several companies in the uk .
2	all the people i spoke to failed to instill any confidece what so ever , an essential requirement when you are thinking of parting with several_thousand_pounds over the internet .
2	watchfinder however were fantastic they could get the watch i wanted at a great price and could facilitate my request for a vat form 000 .
2	they promised to obtain my watch within a month and it came in 00 days .
2	i love my watch and would highly_reccomend watchfinder as the only place to go if your looking for a quality watch .
2	arrived promptly , good price , good product .
2	all rather good really .
2	recommended , will use again .
2	ordered electric mesh fencing to keep fox at bay .
2	used this company as best price and most informative website .
2	delivery was very quick .
2	the fox has not visited , the hens are happy ( except when they get zapped , but they soon learn to .
2	stay clear ).
2	will look to this company again as first choice for poultry supplies
2	i booked a speedy shuttle transfer from palma_airport to our apartment in puerta pollensa .
2	this was roughly three_times the cost of the shared shuttle on the basis that we would be dropped_off quicker after what was a long day with a 00 year_old child in tow .
2	in fact we waited in sweltering heat for about an_hour before we set off and received exactly the same service as if i had booked the shared shuttle .
2	resort_hopper is a decent enough company but you ' re wasting your money if you go for anything other than the basic serice .
2	i '_ve been using lambda - tek for components and hardware for the company i work for , and personal pc requirements .
2	every time the provide great service and prices , and when needed support and advice .
2	i highly_recommend them , and have done so to people at work when they require anything for themselves .
2	good arrived when they said , and with the excellent discriptions i was able to pick the exact items i needed .
2	i was especially grateful to lauren_w for her extremely fast and friendly and efficient way of dealing_with my dilemma !
2	had an issue with my electric_shower ; the shower_doctor '_s advice notes helped to find the issue and which part to purchase for the repair .
2	the service was good
2	ordered a retro phone and from looking through the online catalogue to ordering the phone i required was a simple process .
2	ordered on a friday and the phone was delivered on the monday . delivery was at the time stated on the e_- mail .
2	have to admit best service from an on - line company yet .
2	the fall of icuk
2	having been with icuk for several_years we ’ ve experienced first - hand the gradual degradation of the quality of service and network performance of this isp .
2	once a shining_example of a british broadband_provider who worked hard to stand out from the big_players by providing a premium but reliable internet service , icuk is now nothing more than an overpriced minnow .
2	the service
2	firstly , icuk are a bt reseller .
2	as a result , they cannot ( or at_least have been incompetent in doing so ) quickly and responsively regulate the amount of bandwidth available to their subscription base .
2	as the slow_speeds in certain_areas and cripplingly frequent packet loss demonstrate , the small company don_’_t possess enough clout to force bt ’_s hand to increase their bandwidth when they need it most .
2	prime examples of this include major sporting_events .
2	during the olympics , for example , we could barely load webpages for a fortnight whilst icuk support staff complained that bt hadn_’_t yet processed their request for more bandwidth ( the request being two_weeks outstanding by that stage ).
2	this leaves you and i , the paying customers , with high pings , packet loss exceeding 00_% and sore fingers from typing so many frustrated emails to their support staff over the weekend .
2	telephone support is only available on weekdays and ends at 00 : 00 .
2	you probably_won_’_t be surprised to learn that most issues occur outside of working hours when the majority of people are actually using their internet after coming home from a hard day ’_s work .
2	even on icuk ’_s more_expensive ‘ business ’ package ( as we were ) the worst times for congestion were evenings and weekends ; not standard ‘ business ’ hours – don_’_t fall for this scam like we did .
2	when you find you can only download at 000kb / s ( likely due to network congestion from the aforementioned lack of bandwidth for the entire icuk network or as a result of traffic shaping implemented to compensate the lack of bandwidth ), your only means of resolution is to fire off an email to their support_team which will go_unanswered until the following_day .
2	by this time , tests and assessments of your service will be performed outside of peak hours and an email will follow asking for you to provide more information as they ‘ cannot see a problem from their end ’.
2	the support
2	that last line will probably be one of the most common phrases you will hear from icuk .
2	during the olympics fiasco mentioned_above ( one of many , i must add ) icuk went to the extent of sending an engineer to our house to check the bt lines ( all which were of perfect working order ) before finally letting slip that it might have been their chronically oversubscribed infrastructure that was causing the problem .
2	this was quietly admitted to us in what was probably the 00th email exchange between us and four different members of their support_team ( most of whom are very friendly and genuinely seem to want to help , it must be said ).
2	after that point we were implicitly invited to leave icuk by their staff and it was implied that the problems we suffered as a result of the oversubscription would be a regular_occurrence .
2	this was indeed the case .
2	why icuk ?
2	( why indeed !?)
2	one therefore has to consider what the advantages of icuk are over other resellers and isps .
2	the ( limited ) uk service support is arguably better_than many of the biggest isps and the staff are for the large part friendly and with good intentions .
2	we had only one truly poor engineer assist us and he was removed from our support case after a week of failing to progress matters ( not that this ultimately expedited a resolution ).
2	that said , having better customer_support than the likes of bt is far from high praise and many other smaller uk isps offer similar or better support to their customers ( including during the hours you will actually be using the internet if you ’ re in gainful employment ).
2	in terms of pricing , we found icuk to be slightly more_expensive than other similarly sized isps due to their tiered bandwidth pricing .
2	this is alleviated somewhat if you choose to bundle line rental with them ( as we did – not recommended as it ’_s more inconvenient / expensive to ultimately leave ).
2	as discussed , the quality of the internet service was frequently extremely poor and we had consistent problems throughout our time with icuk , none of which were identified as issues with our hardware or anything our end .
2	the premium pricing therefore no_longer translates to a better quality of service , unlike it did at the time when we first joined all those years_ago .
2	if you don_’_t use the internet for anything more than web browsing then one of the cheaper packages would perhaps be suited for you .
2	if , however , you or any member of your family enjoys online gaming , streaming online television services ( netflix , etc_.)
2	or hasn_’_t a substantial_amount of free time to endlessly chase their support staff , then icuk is definitely not for you .
2	our_household have since changed to a similar small uk isp and could not be_happier with the quality of service we ’ ve received .
2	given the countless hours of frustration and time we ’ ve wasted with icuk i can only make one good faith recommendation to other consumers : avoid .
2	i never received confirmation of my booking in my inbox .
2	called the help line center , expected a load if hassle !
2	received 0st_class , prompt and effective service .
2	polite call_centre operative and instantly knew how to resolve to my the customers satisfaction
2	the trainline is a good service that i can fully recommend
2	spot on service , price , description and service all as_described .

2	and so this dispicable saga goes on .
2	last_week as the response from world_stores indicates i received an apologetic voice_mail , asking me to ring them to discuss , as they recognise that there has_been errors and mistakes that were unacceptable with my order and that they have now upgraded me for a saturday delivery .
2	what they forgot to say was it doesn_'_t matter_how many_times you ring the number ( in my case 00 times to date ) they will not answer .
2	what they also failed to do was obviously advise the couriers that they are to deliver saturday , because they turned_up yesterday morning and duly awoke our neighbour who works nights to take the delivery in for me , which did not go down well at all .
2	then , to my total disbelief , i find that both the tables that they have delivered are damaged .
2	world_stores , even you could not make this any worse if you tried !!
2	!
2	of course i rang their contact number and guess_what , no one could assist me and i would need to call the complaints_dept on the number that no one answers .
2	i will not however , relent until i have a satisfactory_conclusion to this total farce .
2	but then , i will never return to world_stores and advise anyone_else to seriously think_twice .
2	they don_'_t even do the words incompetent , disorganised , chaos or unreliable justice "...................
2	ordered coffee_table and occasional table .
2	coffee_table arrived prompt with order update saying other table will be delayed by supplier .
2	had to wait on calls for nearly an_hour to get update and emailed re the same .
2	received email_stating order coming 0st oct .
2	waited in all day for the 0nd time to then receive a call saying problem with table .
2	shouldn_'_t have been allowed to order one because they come in pairs .
2	would like like to double my cost ??
2	no .
2	agreed their mistake and they accepted and promised to deliver friday 0th_october .
2	it '_s now 0 . 00pm and stayed in a third day and nothing here as yet .
2	rang them up and currently still holding on after 0hr and 00_minutes
2	by far the worst organization i have dealt_with .
2	never known such a poor delivery service by on line traders
2	on the two occasions i have now used serenata_flowers . com i have been totally impressed with the service and the updates of when they have been ordered , dispatched and finally delivered .
2	then to receive a email_saying that someone is thinking of you , i . e the recipient of the flowers , was a great gesture and topped the service hat i have received .
2	i will_continue to use serenata for both the quality of the service and he quality of the flowers , it is a complete service , whereby once i have placed an order , there is nothing else to do or worry_about .
2	totally professional .
2	thank_you very much .

2	i wanted to find winter_tyres for our rover 00 so i started searching the ' net ( like you do ) and read_reviews of various tyres until i was totally tired out .
2	during my delvings , i came_across black_circles and other online tyre sellers .
2	so , after a bit of head_scratching , i decided on dunlop_sp response 0 which were cheaper_elsewhere but ' er_indoors wanted the tesco_club points that black_circles were offering , so they got the sale .
2	ordered and paid for one afternoon , the tyres arrived the next_day .
2	a local tyre company had said that it ' d take them ' 0 or 0 days to get ' em as they had to come from dunlop '.
2	well_done black_circles .
2	as i write the dunlops are being fitted to second - hand steel rims from my local car breaker .
2	i '_ll let you know how i get on with them when i '_ve done some cold_weather mileage .

2	i moved to an empty flat in london in august , and must have spent in excess of gbp 0 , 000 since then at tesco , both online as well in the nearest_store .
2	i am not used to order grocery online and was admittedly a bit_skeptical at my first delivery , that never arrived .
2	after phoning tesco they initially told me it was my fault for not being at home , but they discovered that although my address was right in the system the print for the driver somehow cut_off the last digit in my flat no so they delivered to the wrong flat .
2	tesco assured this would be corrected , but due to shortage of people they could no_longer deliver that day .
2	0nd , 0rd and 0th time the same happened except the portner saw my name and knew it was wrong so they got here anyway .
2	today we have a new portner here and the same thing happened , the grocery newer reached me .
2	well after a identical conversation as the first time , tesco realized that they did not correct the mistake , and assured me from the call_center in scotland that they would deliver this same day .
2	well after having heard_nothing for two hours i called again and was told they have staff shortage ( where have i heard that before ) and could not deliver .
2	now i had it , i will now give sainsbury a chance and suggest everybody_else does the same .
2	excellent company have used many many_times never had a problem and would recommend to anyone without_reservation .
2	this is the third mobile i have sold to mazuma never encountered any_problems once mobiles have been received money in the bank same day would recommend to anyone .
2	great watch , good price , delivered quickly .
2	this was my first time of asking for help since using the service for over a year .
2	leanne corrected my mistake in an instant and reassured me that the delivery was still ok .
2	the strings were recommended by my teacher and have exceeded our expectations .
2	as a beginner my fingers were suffering , but these silk / steel eased the problem .
2	the guitar sounds great too .
2	very fast service and will be using this site for the next set :-)
2	a very fast and efficient service .
2	the " returns " bag arrived the next_day and i had the money in my account within 0 days
2	i ordered 00 full kits from akuma , the bespoke_design altered a few_times during the process but this was never seen as a problem the design was altered and then sent for approval .
2	once the design was agreed and the order was actually made the payment process was easy and delivery time great .
2	good communication between akuma and the customer kept me fully_updated as to the completion of the order and to which location the order was to be delivered and when .
2	i would thoroughly_recommend akuma for your sports kit suppliers and i look_forward to doing_business with them again in the bear future .
2	just as i said in the title , the delivery was super_fast which is good when you '_ve left your order to the last_minute .
2	the price was right as well having to stick to a tight_budget makes trophies & medals my first call every time .
2	i have been using them now for the last 0 years and they have been great to deal with .
2	used the currency_club for the first time to purchase us_dollars , the transaction was simple the exchange_rate the best i could_find anywhere and there '_s no charge for delivery in the uk .
2	once i had completed the bank_transfer i received a prompt email_confirming_receipt of the transfer and less_than 00_hours_later i had the dollars in my hand .
2	i would highly_recommend this service and will_definitely use it as my foreign_exchange service from now on .
2	the first appointment had to be cancelled due to the weather but the second appointment was brilliant , i think this needs to be pointed_out that if you do not have a garsge then a replacement screen can only be done in the dry .
2	my only complaint is that the v . a . t is not shown until you buy , it would be better to add the v . a . t so you know the full price apart_from delivery , having said that i would / will still order again .
2	my item arrived well_packaged and within the time span specified
2	very happy with the service provided and would recommend this company
2	pete

2	for the third time this year i have used ao . com and been very pleased .
2	not only are the prices good but their communication is excellent .
2	i like particularly the communication that narrows down your delivery slot and then the actual person delivering gives you a call to say how many minutes they are away from you .
2	the service makes armchair shopping an excellent experience when dealing_with a company of this quality .
2	the speed of turn_around for the order cannot be_faulted .
2	will make this our first stop_shop for the future .
2	i ordered three items and got a very good price when comparing with other_suppliers .
2	communication was good and delivery fast .

2	no_hassle .
2	my wife '_s favourite has_been_discontinued ; however , there are places on the net that it can still be purchased .
2	as with a lot of old favourites , when you do find a supply you have to pay the price .
2	i found my wife '_s favourite on perfume_click with free delivery , so compared with many suppliers it was very reasonable .
2	this christmas i am going to be in the good books without being too extravagent .
2	hassle_free ordering , arrived very quickly and very well_packaged , will be ordering from again .. 000_%
2	i buy my red clover tablets from simply_supplements and probably always will as i can trust them to post them to me fast ....
2	order stuff from this company and it will arrive incomplete because they have to order from holland .
2	i have ordered at_least 0 times because the lighting they sell suits my needs , but god it is a messy business ordering and receiving .
2	and the stuff they sell is not cheap , i wish they would polish their act it is very frustrating waiting weeks and weeks for stuff to arrive when you hope it is going to arrive sooner_than later ....
2	i have had 0 orders from this company , their delivery is outstanding and their communication about dispatch and delivery is outstanding .
2	if you order today it will arrive tomorrow and they sell really good lighting , i am very happy to order more lighting from this company in the future .
2	wish all online shopping was this good ...
2	found the web_site very well_constructed , products well described and prices very competitive .
2	delivery costs were not excessive and promptness of delivery was second to none .
2	very pleased with the buying experience with a0boffice and would recommend them to anyone .
2	definitely set_up as one of my web favourites and will use again .
2	i '_ve now bought several items from this website as i '_m refitting my kitchen and up till now there are zero issues .
2	the price and quality are great and all delivery drivers have called to tell me what time they will arrive .
2	you get an estimated time of arrival by tracking on line then the driver calls on the day with a time usually within the hour .
2	top_marks for ao . coml
2	dealt_with a quality problem with speed , efficiency and common_sense .
2	i '_m shocked by how good these glasses are .

2	a truly superb product , delivered the next_day and the postage was free !!
2	you '_ve restored my faith in online purchasing and i can unreservedly_recommend your company .
2	thank_you read optics .
2	i have a had lot of experience of purchasing from the " web " and i can_honestly_say that sunglassjunkie is a great site .
2	it '_s easy , straight_forward and very clear .
2	the product is quality and the prices are keen and set to be very competetive .
2	whilst i don_'_t buy sunglasses every day , i would have no_hesitation of recommending this company to friends and family .
2	well_done for an excellent site .
2	fast efficient service and excellent value when compared to the high_street and their direct competition .
2	tyres arrived when predicted to .
2	they were bubble_wrapped and boxed in a oversize contained - overkill ?
2	- yes .
2	but it did display a level of care .
2	i would use the company again .
2	i ordered some shure se000s ( a hugely expensive product ) one evening .
2	they were dispatched the next_day and arrived the day after .
2	they were faulty straight out of the box but hifiheadphones quickly got back to me with a return code .
2	as soon as they arrived back at hifiheadphones i had an email to let_me know .
2	there was no direct replacement available but , a few emails later , a different_colour set were on there way to me .
2	from initial order to receipt of replacement only took one week in total .
2	i feel i received 000_% service .
2	i believe that the only thing hifiheadphones could have done to improve the service was to have emailed me tracking_numbers for the two deliveries .
2	i would wholeheartedly and unreservedly_recommend them to anyone and will_certainly be using them again myself .
2	well_done and thank_you to hifiheadphones !
2	i found loose stitching on a seatback when i unpacked the sofas .
2	when i contacted the sofa company they said they would do nothing as the damage had not been reported within two_days of receipt .
2	reading the t &_c '_s this only appears to refer to transit_damage which wasn_'_t the case here .
2	as mentioned by another_reviewer their courier will only deliver to kerbside so this meant that my wife and i had to struggle to get the furniture inside .
2	we scuffed one bottom corner so i am not pursuing their response further and seeking a swap .
2	i just want to make_sure other potential_customers don_'_t have the same problem .
2	since posting my original review i have been contacted by the customer_care manager at sofa company who arranged for a contractor to visit and repair the missing stitching and also the scuff on the base .
2	very happy with result and action taken .
2	i ordered a sink and tap for a new kitchen .
2	tap arrived but not the sink and it wasn_'_t till i chased that i found out a fault had been noted and they were getting a replacement .
2	quality issue would appear to be with manufacturer so no fault with taps uk .
2	e_- bay messages were responded to reasonably quickly and issue was resolved .
2	refund for returned sink took a while to appear .
2	this is the place to get your holiday money , fantastic service
2	i have now placed 0 orders with swell and have never disappointed yet .
2	every delivery has_been well_packed , no missing order items and delivered very quickly .
2	unless anything bad happens ( which i doubt !
2	), swell will be my prefered supplier for my aquarium orders .
2	after years of using a well know tyre_fitting company , i had enough of damage alloys , tyres_fitted incorrectly etc , i gave blackcircles . com a go .
2	the process was excellent , the choice of tyres was vast and it even put me in touch with a lovley family owned garage ( tst tyres ) with lovely staff which i will_definatley will be using again .
2	i thought the web_page was simple to follow and and your sevice fast and very effiecient and will always consider_using you in the future
2	when i first started to use myprotin for my supliments it was because they had what i needed at a reasonable price .
2	i couldn_'_t belive the delivery was acctualy next_day .
2	i chose dpd courier as my option and they actualy emailed me to tell me what time they would be there .
2	i find that the products work better_than the leading_brands and are a lot cheeper .
2	especialy if you buy in bulk .
2	there are no fancy packaging just good quality supliments .
2	i highly_recommend this supplier .
2	they have a huge_range of stock and can always quickly recommend the correct bulb for your purposes , prices are competitive - especially if you spend enough to qualify for free_postage ( just lay in a stock of commonly used bulbs !).
2	once , a few_years_ago , i suspected i had bulbs from a bad batch .
2	they were replaced immediately and without_question .
2	prompt and efficient service are the hallmarks of a good internet supplier ; immediate resolution of problems is the province of the really great ones .
2	it '_s all in the header :-)
2	they advertised that it would take two_days to process an order , and three or four days to deliver .
2	they took my money in seconds , but nearly a week_later they were still " processing " the order .
2	when i first tried to cancel , they begged me not to saying they would be able to send my " camera " within a week .
2	i was not reassured - i had ordered a mobile_phone .
2	i cancelled .
2	it has taken seven weeks to get a refund from them during which time i have sent innumerable e_- mails , telephoned and hand to stand the interest charges on my credit_card .
2	avoid them .
2	buy somewhere_else .
2	dreadful call_centre wait times - held on for 00_minutes today ( after the initial message said wait times were around 00 min ).
2	when i got through was advised i need to call again tomorrow to get a mac_code or for alternative broadband deals .
2	cheap and very quick to come - i was entirely_satisfied
2	great service brilliant communications
2	excellent service from speaking to sales to having the items delivered .
2	will_definitely use again .
2	very fast delivery , well_packaged .
2	i '_m very pleased with the service standard
2	well thought out website , makes product selection and ordering very easy .
2	first_class delivery .
2	was a little_concerned_about ordering online , but everything_went as they said it would , came well before the stated delivery date an is well liked my fiancé
2	unfortunately late but that was prob down to my local postie not knowing when valentines_day was
2	excellent product , well priced and prompt delivery .
2	excellent service and very good price .
2	many_thanks , paul
2	easy method for achieving insurance_cover .
2	i have just moved home , where i had a raised_toilet . i found the toilet at my new home was very low , which caused pain in my hips and knees . i purchased a 0 inch toilet_seat from care co . the seat is just the right height for my needs . which makes_life so much_easier . the seat blends in with my bathroom , it is not too noticable from an ordinary seat . it is easy to fit , easy to clean and was a great price . i have recommended care co to my friends and family .
2	thank_you care co .
2	really easy to order , arrived in a couple of days .
2	can '_t say , or ask any more than that .
2	0 *
2	felt_like_cattle in cattle class .
2	would prefer to pay more for a bit more luxury so won_'_t hurry back
2	good prices , quick service at a garage that you select .
2	what else can i say , excellent .
2	cheaper_than buying direct from manufacturer very quick delivery - what '_s not to like !
2	had my pc delivered by this company .
2	was told day of delivery in advance and time_slot to within 0 houron the day .
2	package duely arrived with stated time_slot .
2	what more could i ask for !
2	i found age_partnership to be fast andvery helpfull in ther resonse to my reqest for information_regarding my pension well_done them
2	multiple_locations in the s . w and midlands but all had sales staff that did not care one hoot for potential_buyers .
2	drove 000_miles to test_drive a car in solihull - they forgot i was coming .
2	eventually got 0 mins in the car and decided to take it further .
2	could not give me p / x on the day but , fine .
2	eventually called me back 0 days_later - when i said the price offered it was a bit low , never_heard back .
2	their loss - bought car for 00_% more than i was going for with them 0 days_later from an smaller jag franchise .
2	one of the nicest signs i have seen .
2	not a single flaw and it was delivered exactly on schedule .
2	a nice_touch was that every piece needed to affix the sign was provided including the glue .
2	excellent next_day service , very competetive price compared to other_companies
2	i purchased a submersible pump from tooled_- up over the weekend & wondered_if it would arrive in time for me to use on the following thursday . i rang their office on the monday_morning & spoke to a very helpful chap_called andy , he assured me it would be on time and it was . i got a text to say what time it would arrive & it arrived within the time_slot , and well_packaged .
2	the pump was simple to use & although it took a few minutes to get the water through the new hose , this will not be a problem next time . the pump was reduced in price in their sale & even with the price of the hose it still worked out to only two_thirds of the cost to hire a similer pump .
2	i was very impressed with the product & the service , so thank_you tooled_- up , i will be useing you again . gerry mcgowan
2	i have been in sales all my life with mainly international food supply to the major_retailers so i know how much you value customer feedback at last a company on - line that ticks_all the boxes pricing , service , response , customer driven i would has at a guess that your complaints_department is not very busy !
2	in my humble_opinion you are a company that has done the research and has got it spot on ... well_done you deserve to meet all your expectations for future growth best of luck for 0000 .
2	great service amazing response , if it is a quality pre_owned_watch you want then look no further .
2	the best after sales service you will get and by far the best company in the watch market , believe me i have tried others .
2	brian hodgetts
2	quality gear from a great company !
2	we feel that we have been let_down very badly by this company !
2	their customer_services are a total_shambles , they either ignore you or just don_'_t answer any of your comments .
2	they havent answered an email for over a month !
2	we have been trying to obtain a refund for an item we purchased , we have been fed a saga of lies , changing information and today when it was promised the goods woould be returned to us " repaired " they have failed to deliver them .
2	this company is excellent if you don_'_t have a problem but any issue with the product they make life very very difficult ...
2	in future we will be more concerned_about customer service than just the lowest_price ...
2	delivered day after order , excellent service
2	can not fault this company , great product , fantastic service , highly_recommend
2	i phoned this company as i was working in the area .
2	both my iphone and ipad were broken ( some say clumsy ) asking if they do a while you wait service .
2	the response was of course no problem .
2	dropped both the ipad and iphone off ( not literally ) and went for some breakfast ...
2	both were done in just 0 hour .
2	the no problem , leave it with us approach was fantastic .
2	the finished product was like brand_new , professionally checked before i left .
2	great service , would highly_recommend this company for good old_fashioned honest service
2	all good just slightly worrying that the web - site booking gives no details at all of the room except that it is a double .
2	also , i know breakfast is served at the hotel but breakfast was not an option with trustpilot .
2	great website just wish they would not keep changing it every few_months
2	always a great flight out to spain with happy smiles on faces
2	a0 helpers on the paypal call_centre
2	a0 help line on ebay fast and effective
2	catherine on the help_desk was a0 thanks again
2	great product , great service , definately recommend .
2	we ordered a 0ft wide mattress , delivery was as arranged but when dropped_off men did not hang_around long enough for us to check it .
2	it turns_out that we had the wrong_size 0 ' 0 which is too_narrow .
2	we phoned customer_services who insisted we got what we ordered , they refusd to believe us when we told them we clicked on 0ft one , then said it was out fault because the size was not mentioned in confirmation_email it say '_s small single it does not mention exact size , if it did say 0 ' 0 we would have phoned to point out their mistake .
2	they would only exchange mattresses if we paid a £_00 handling charge .
2	we offered to meet them half way and pay £_00 but they refused .
2	we have been advised by trading_standards that under the sale of goods_act_0000 we received an item that was not as_descibed , so we are entitled to a refund or exchange .
2	as matressman have refused the exchange we have had to buy another mattress from another dealer so our disabled child has somewhere to sleep , so will now be insisting on a full_refund .
2	as instructed by trading_standards we will be writing via_recorded delivery , stating our case .
2	they are satisfied that the actual size is not mentioned in your email .
2	and as mattressman customer_services said before we were put through to the assistant_manager and not the manger as requested , small single could be one of a few sizes .
2	mattressman order : mm000000
2	i came to quiet_pc after two previous very poor experiences with online gaming_pc vendors .
2	i wish i had read the trustpilot reviews first !
2	the website was extremely easy to use and the ordering / payment process could not have gone more smoothly .
2	quiet even managed to change a key item midway through the process without_any difficulties ; and ( key to the whole_experience ) kept me fully_informed_throughout .
2	the pc ( over £_0k worth ) arrived early .
2	one usb_hub connector was loose but the completely excellent customer service team ( thanks simon ) sorted me out quick time .
2	the willingness to put time and effort into my issue was exemplary ; so too was the keeping of promises ( call_backs when promised etc .
2	).
2	as for the pc - i could not be more pleased .
2	quiet does not describe it .
2	quiet_pc should perhaps change their name to silent pc ( only a very slight_exaggeration !
2	).
2	one niggle that i cannot even blame quiet for is that two of the games for which i bought the pc do not actually work with it .
2	the game developers are still working on the problem ( s ) and just in case anyone is interested i will update this review when or if there is any progress .
2	thanks quiet_pc .
2	update_: the gaming problem was two - fold - in one case a usb joystick driver incompatibility issue and the other a gpu driver update issue .
2	it took_ages to identify both but both are now completely sorted .
2	not a quiet_pc problem at all .
2	great communication , fast & friendly service , products accurately_described , would recommend & use again .
2	mazuma can be trusted for a hassle - free transaction .
2	i '_ve had a shocking experience with another company who initially offered more money for my phone , but took nearly two months to pay , and then offered me a much reduced payment .
2	this , they said was due to " water_damage " and missing charger .
2	the water_damage was complete conjecture , ( the phone was very well_packaged and sealed in bubble - wrap ) and the only place it said the charger was required was in the small_print buried away in the t '_s &_c '_s .
2	i went with the offer as they wanted £ 0 to return the phone to me !
2	it would be unprofessional of me to mention who this other company is , but remember that if you find a seemingly better offer for your phone , read the reviews on trustpilot or similar before dealing_with that company , and make_sure you read their fine print !
2	in contrast , dealing_with mazuma was a breeze .
2	they are very efficient , and providing the phone meets their basic criteria , e . g .
2	working / non - working , no damage , etc_., the agreed payment is made to you on the day they receive it .
2	i can '_t recommend mazuma highly_enough and would definitely use them again .
2	cheapest price i found on the web , and latest_version tomtom .
2	cheaper_than many others selling an older_version .
2	item arrived next_day so very happy with the service .
2	one very minor_issue : no english instructions included , so had to download from tomtom , but overall i would definitely recommend this company .
2	use this company as they are the quickest and most efficient parcel post company in the uk ... dermot ; 0 )
2	excellent service , prices and prompt delivery as usual , wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else .
2	:-)
2	think carefully before you do_business with this company .
2	i bought a pair of expensive ray - ban prescription lens sunglasses .
2	they arrived eventually ... so_far so good ...
2	then a few_months later i broke one of the lenses .
2	i contacted vd who offered to fix the lenses for a fee and it would take 0_weeks .. so_far so good .. that was back in june_0000 ..
2	it is now late september and multiple stalling emails from vd reveal they have lost my glasses in hong_kong .
2	okay these things_happen but it has taken them 0 months to admit it and now they don_'_t want to take_responsibility .
2	my glasses cost over $_000 . 00 and i also paid around $_000 . 00 for the repair up front .
2	so now i have no glasses and have paid for a repair .. every time vd contacts me it is someone_else .
2	lesson_learned .
2	when you can '_t physically walk into a store and complain you stand a chance in being treated_like dirt .
2	all i want is my repair money refunded and my property back or my glasses replaced but am getting_nowhere .
2	avoid ........... avoid ............ avoid !
2	0000 customer service prem rate no ,££ customer service operators work from asia very poor english
2	00p a minute to land lines in the uk shocking
2	i have been a customer for 00 years in the last 0 months the charges have gone_through the roof
2	almost_impossible to speak to customer service via your mobile
2	all automated now then it will cut you off
2	" t " mobile offered me a deal yesterday when i asked for my pat code and told them i had enough and was leaving , 000 minutes 000 texts and a freephone upgrade .. ok i said .. today the phone arrived with a bill of £_00 . 00 receipted " paid " they have taken £_00 . 00 form my credit_card without authorisation enough !
2	my advise to all avoid .. avoid ... avoid terrible service !
2	misleading salesmen very expensive just awful
2	filter cap - hard to find - was available and dispatched in short time .
2	i am_delighted o use opodo once again , price comparison and booking of travel on one fast working webpage .
2	excellent prices , not the first time and certainly not the last time to use opodo
2	i ordered a fridge from powerdirect .
2	payment was taken at the time of order .
2	however , 0 days_later i received an email_saying that the fridge i had ordered was no_longer being manufactured and would i like an_alternative .
2	i then had to fill out a refund form to get the money back ( within " up to 00 days ") that they shouldn_'_t have taken in the first place .
2	my follow_up email asking why they had taken payment blamed sagepay .
2	i know how sagepay works , and the powerdirect representative was lying .
2	speak as i find .
2	the price was very competitive .
2	the delivery was good .
2	i did have a problem with the product itself and justoffbase went out of their way and contacted draper to sort it out .
2	would definately consider_using them again .
2	this is one excellent company the goods are first_class , with quick delivery , and good prices .
2	just booked uk premier meet &_greet car parking at manchester_airport through fhr .
2	booking process easy , price was competitive , and cheaper_than some park and ride .
2	always used park and ride in the past , but got fed_up of waiting for bus and delays getting to and from airport .
2	will update review when we return to confirm if everything works out as planned !
2	first time we have used clicktransfers and if this is an example of how they operate then they shall be our only choice in the future .
2	we booked a private_transfer from tenerife_south airport to costa adeje .
2	after making ourselves known to their local supplier we were immediately taken to our transport .
2	as quick , if not quicker , than a taxi and cheaper .
2	courteous driver assisted with luggage both on and off .
2	return was straightforward with a phone_call to english_speaking office 00 hr before departure and pick_up on time .
2	stress_free , as it should be !
2	i am always wonderfully surprised at just how quick strings_direct are at getting your order to you .
2	i need strings one day and they are there the next .
2	fantastic service and prices as well .
2	i recommend transferwise .
2	great exchange_rate and deal all concluded very quickly .
2	have used this company before and would use again .
2	competitive_pricing .
2	ordered on standard delivery .
2	delighted when purchase arrived 00_hours_later .
2	first_class .
2	would use again
2	i mailed my old phone on friday , the money was in my bank on monday , great sevice !
2	i cannot_fault either the quality of the goods or the standard of service i received from p_f jones .
2	right from the initial order through to the towbar being fitted at my workplace , i was kept_informed by telephone .
2	the entire_process could not have been made more simple , and many other_companies would do well to follow the example set by this company !
2	pay about 00 pounds a month for an abysmal service .
2	engineers not showing up three_times now , uncaring customer service team .
2	do not go near this company !
2	i was recommended to flightshop buy a friend i found the ordering simple & no_fuss and my purchase was delivered promptly . id certainly recommend this site to others .
2	the staff are very helpful , and kept me informed on the progress of my pension transfer .
2	the proses was quicker_than i expected , and i can now tack the holiday i was hoping for .
2	good initial price but then a booking_fee added .
2	if something is non - optional then please include it in the headline cost , cos you have to pay it .
2	i was very impressed with this company it was my first time using wood_finishes direct and i will definetely use this company again . they are 0st on coming up with the goods at the right price and delivery .
2	( 0_stars 0 sure )
2	an excellent service a very good product well_packed and delivered to the door next_day and at the right price yes i would recommend this company and i would use them again that is why i given them 0_stars
2	needed to get a sculpture from one end of the country to my home .
2	wasn_'_t practical to do this myself and used shiply to get bids on the delivery .
2	selected the best based on reviews and cost and wasn_'_t disappointed .
2	great service overall .
2	it was easy to book and they did every thing that we desired and the description of the hotel was very accurate except the name which is now the rosen inn international
2	great service as it said on the package and more .
2	i was very surprised at the very quick service .
2	make '_s a change in this day and age
2	we received everything that we paid for and even more , i would , and have recommended travel nations to friends and family .
2	we where quoted a great price for around the world trip , are flights and hotels where excellent , everything_went like clock work .
2	we couldn_'_t have asked for a better holiday .
2	hello again ,
2	another courier moan and groan from me , maybe i '_m just unlucky ?
2	booked a delivery through parcel0go , thought i ' d try city_link , next_day service , city_link failed to collect two_days running .
2	rang city_link to ask why ?
2	they said it was an i . t .
2	problem with their new system and issued a new tracking_number and promise of collection , they also gave_me a number to contact parcel0go for a refund .
2	rang parcel0go , they said i could not have a refund as there was no guarantee of collection ( basically hard luck !
2	), they then changed the courier to tnt as they said they were more reliable than city_link ????
2	?
2	rang city_link who said only parcel0go could issue a refund ,
2	at this point i gave up !
2	city_link let_me down but cant give a refund and parcel0go wont give a refund , where do i stand ???
2	?
2	i have refunded my customers post as i '_m an honest kind of guy and don_'_t like people to be let_down , my loss i know but i prefer to be honest .
2	look at all the other reviews for city_link , what a terrible company record , so bad i suspect the only good reviews are from their employees paid to do so .
2	update , update , update !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2	!
2	city_link asked me to contact them after_reading this review ,
2	i did and this is the message i recieved .
2	good afternoon mr brammer ,
2	further from my recent email , i am sorry for the delay in responding to you .
2	thank_you for your patience and understanding .
2	the depot manager at shrewsbury has_been investigating further and we have discovered that there has_been an it issue , resulting in your consignments not being allocated to their depot for collection .
2	they have reported the problem to our it department to ensure this gets resolved as quickly as possible .
2	i understand you have booked a new collection for today , they have confirmed this has now been allocated to a driver to ensure you have no further delays .
2	once again , please_accept our apologies for the inconvenience or frustration that has_been caused on this occasion .
2	if there is anything_else i can help you with then do get in touch .
2	kind_regards ,
2	s . a .
2	city_link
2	this was my response
2	hello s . a . city_link
2	once again i have to say i am in disbelief !
2	you have spent the morning gathering information that i already have ?
2	did you read my review ?
2	it clearly_states i was aware of an it problem , i told you that ?
2	it also states tnt are now the couriers for this consignment and they have collected it in the last hour ,
2	so why city_link are collecting today as well is beyond me , they probably wont turn_up anyway .
2	my point is i ’ ve had to refund my customer as he paid for 00 hr courier not 00 hr courier .
2	i shall now add this further info to my trustpilot review as my time has_been wasted even further what a joke !
2	end .
2	what a waste of time , they responded to my review without reading it ,
2	beggars_belief .
2	i run a busy ebay shop , have about 000 sales a week and for the last two years used ipostparcels to deliver my parcels ,
2	recently they started to miss collections so i thought i would give yodel a go , they couldn ’_t be any worse , could they ?
2	well , after visiting the yodel website , clicking on yodel direct , setting_up an account of i went ,
2	my first parcel about 0kg and measuring 00cm square was booked in for 00 hr delivery and next_day collection as a tester , the driver arrived , signed for the collection and left me with a collection note , the collection note had a different tracking_number than i was given by the website ?
2	yodel directs tracking_number starts with yol
2	yodels tracking_number starts with jd00
2	pleased my parcel had been collected on time i thought all was well !
2	next_day i tracked the parcel online , the parcel was at the local wrexham service centre ( yodel ),
2	not out for delivery as expected ?
2	i thought let ’_s give them an extra day !
2	the day after that it was still in wrexham , i rang yodel , the customer service member said he would raise a flag on the parcel and it would be delivered in the next 00_hrs .
2	the day after that it was still in wrexham , i web chatted with a yodel representative , she said she would raise a flag and asked about the parcel contents .
2	the day after that it was still in wrexham , , i web chatted again ( now getting a bit angry ) with a yodel representative , he apologised asked about the parcel contents and raised an even bigger flag to find the parcel .
2	the day after that it was still in wrexham , my customer emailed me to cancel the order as he had lost_patience and bought locally ( don_’_t blame him ), i refunded him in full , total of £_00
2	i web chatted again ( now getting very angry ) with a yodel representative , he apologised ,
2	i told_him if the parcel was found to return to my address , he confirmed this would happen .
2	the day after that the parcel was not in wrexham , it had been delivered five days late to the customer that had cancelled , and not back to me ????
2	?
2	yodel chat begins
2	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 hi david , my name is [_name ].
2	how can i help ?
2	david : 00 : 00 : 00 gave tracking_number
2	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 thank_you .
2	can you please confirm your full name ?
2	david : 00 : 00 : 00 this item went missing for 0 days last_week , eventually my customer cancelled the order and bought his items locally , i had a live_chat on friday asking if it was found please return to me .
2	i was told it would be , it has now been found and delivered to the original address
2	00 : 00 : 00 my address is entered address 00 : 00 : 00 how will i now get my items back ?
2	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 thank_you , david .
2	can you please confirm the customers full name ?
2	david : 00 : 00 : 00 customers name is gave name , i have been so let_down and messed about its unbelievable !
2	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 i apologise about this confusion here , david , but there '_s no notes to show that the parcel was requested to be returned back to you .
2	david : 00 : 00 : 00 this is the first item i sent with yodel , and what a total_failure it has_been , the live_chat on friday confirmed it would be , i cant_remember the name but it was a man
2	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 i apologise about that , david .
2	if you ' re wanting to retrieve the parcel , then you can book a collection of the parcel from your customer .
2	david : 00 : 00 : 00 how do i do that ?
2	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 you can raise the issue with the yodel direct online web chat team and they will be able to book the collection in for you as well .
2	david : 00 : 00 : 00 are you saying i have to pay to get it back after its yodels mistake ?
2	00 : 00 : 00 or can you book it in now ?
2	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 i cannot book collections for yodel direct customers , as we ' re technically separate companies .
2	if you speak with their online web chat team , like you ' re doing with me , you will be able to query this with them .
2	david : 00 : 00 : 00 another failure , unbelievable waste of time .
2	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 i apologise for the inconvenience_caused here , david .
2	david : 00 : 00 : 00 s far as i can see yodel yodel direct have no contact details or online web chat team
2	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 there '_s a help button in the top corner of the page , and it will present you with some questions .
2	if you answer one of these it will give you a link to the web chat team .
2	stop ?
2	lets stop a minute .
2	question , why is it when you visit yodels web_page the online_chat almost throws itself at you ?
2	but when you visit yodel directs web_page you have no obvious contact ?
2	you have to click on help , pick a question and if your lucky an option appears for a web chat ?
2	hiding like a frightened mouse with no hole to go down and the breath of a hungry cat warming its face ?
2	now lets continue .
2	yodel direct chat begins
2	you are now chatting with yodel direct
2	yodel : hi david .
2	yodel : im_afraid this has_been delivered david .
2	if you wish for this to be returned you will need to make a new order .
2	david : yodel have delivered this in error , are you saying i have to pay for yodels mistake ?
2	david : i was told if found it would be sent back to me .
2	yodel : we was never contacted to advise for this to be returned david .
2	david : yes you were on friday i had a live_chat and it was confirmed .
2	yodel : we have never been contacted you chatted with yodel david who as i can see from above told you you needed to contact yodeldirect
2	david : i contacted yodel who told me once found it would be returned , now after loosing the parcel for five days , upsetting my customer , hours of typing loss of sales , your telling_me i have to pay to get my items back ?
2	yodel : you have not contacted yodeldirect david which is who you booked with .
2	this has_been delivered .
2	david : i contact yodel who told me it would be returned , only this morning did they tell me to contact you , also my item was delivered five days late so i should have a refund on my post
2	yodel : im_afraid the service which we offer is non guaranteed which is stated when booking david . yodel :
2	ouch !
2	ouch !
2	ouch !
2	david : your reviews on trustpilot are a disgrace and i can see why , you treat_customers like dirt .
2	and pass the buck from one side to the other , and for the sake of returning a parcel you have now lost hundreds of deliveries from my company company name , it beggers belief .
2	yodel : im very sorry to hear this david .
2	however you booked the order with yodeldirect and we have not been contacted to ask for the item to be returned .
2	yes booked yodeldirect but given yodel tracking_number frightened mouse !
2	lets spin a coin , heads it gets delivered tails it dont .
2	david : in the end its yodels loss , i will write lots of reviews and post them , you will lose my business and many others for the incompetence yodel has shown .
2	yodel : is there anything_else i can help you with ?
2	david : you are like a robot , and follow rules but this is no joke repeating the same answer , please can some one superior contact me on phone number
2	yodel : i am the online supervisor david , as i have advised if you wish for the item to be returned this will be on your own_accord .
2	david : goodbye yodel , one huge let - down , one joke of a company , one parcel sent and one big_mistake .
2	and there we have it , i now have to pay to get my items back , there is no refund for late delivery ( 00_hrs took 0 days ) and yodel are two different companies , with two tracking_numbers and probably too many chiefs and not enough indians .
2	i was given a yodel tracking_number but told i should have contacted yodel direct , confusing isn_'_t it ?
2	it seems they split the company so one side can blame the other , i mean how do you loose a parcel for 0 days and then make the customer fight for any kind of refund , instead of a refund they kick you whilst your down ?
2	?.
2	i post 000 parcels a week if yodel were a football_team they would lose 000 - 0 ever week mostly from own goals , and their manager would be sacked .
2	nice one yodel , welcome to the conference of couriers .
2	other reviews say it all .
2	[_external_reference_] deluged with complaints over yodel '_s poor delivery service
2	more than 0 , 000 customers call for [_external_reference_] to join [_external references ] in ditching parcel carrier yodel
2	thank_you for listening ,
2	regards ,
2	david .
2	after many_years of using ipostparcels , i can_honestly_say this company has now gone into complete disarray , one missed collection after another , no phone number , no customer_care , sent emails get no response despite their claims to get back to you in three hours , you are totally at the mercy of a roulette wheel with this company you bet red or black and it comes up a sickly green .
2	they used to be very good , but i can only think internally they are now in chaos .
2	goodbye ipostparcels r . i . p
2	item ordered on 00th_jan , came lunchtime on 00th .
2	excellent service and item good value , thanks
2	quick response and fast shipment .
2	excellent speedy service .
2	took far less time than_expected .
2	ordered flea_treatment online , sent off the prescriptions and the medicated arrived within 0 days , excellent service .
2	five_stars
2	the rental company was alamo in new_orleans , the car we got had only delivery mileage and was superb to drive .
2	plenty of space for all four of us with our_luggage .
2	the service staff at the airport were very helpful , both on arrival and on return .
2	i would recommend this company to everyone !
2	i '_ve_used this company lots of times over the last_year .
2	like everyone_else i was sceptical_about buying glasses over the internet .
2	what can i say ................. faultless service , prompt .
2	basically everything that you could ask for - without the high_street prices .
2	this company have never_let_me down !
2	i '_ve just bought another pair of sunglasses and a pair of casual glasses for working outside - £_00 all in for quality glasses - try and beat that !!!!!!
2	!
2	had oil and vinegar drizzlers bought me as a gift .
2	returned them by post (£ 0 . 00 ) as both stoppers kept rising out of the bottles rendering them useless .
2	procook told me that only one bottle acted thus and they would not be refunding my postage as i had not phoned them first for an authorisation_code !
2	firstly , i do not like being called a liar .
2	secondly , someone should train them up in customer_services and teach them not to tell their bread and butter whether their goods work or not .
2	i had never_heard of procook until i received this gift but will make_sure i never by from them .
2	never seen this company before , but as we needed a new computer chair , they came up in a search .
2	decided to give them a try .
2	glad i did .
2	for the quality you get the price is amazing .
2	very quickly delivered and just as quick to assemble .
2	would recommend to anyone .
2	what more to say ......?
2	i booked a vehicle on line from economy_car_rentals in march_0000 for a week in august that they described on their website as ‘ intermediate , ford_focus or similar ’ and the capacity of the boot was described as ‘ 0 large suitcases 000_litres and 0 small suitcases 00 litres ’.
2	i deliberately did not book the small car option .
2	when we arrived to pick_up the vehicle at dalaman_airport in turkey the representative from sax car_rental presented us with a tiny renault_clio .
2	i explained that this was not the type of car i had paid and after insisting that this was not satisfactory she made a call to her manager and then told me there was no other car available and that as far as the rental company was concerned i could take it or leave it .
2	by now the whole family and all our holiday luggage was on a petrol_station forecourt in the dark next to a busy_road leading to the airport .
2	we had no alternative but to put all our_luggage into the boot and back seat and accept the vehicle .
2	when i complained to economy_car_rentals they investigated and then copied me in on a very rude email from their representatives sax car_rental suggesting that a renault_clio was the same size as a ford_focus with the same boot capacity !
2	sax concluded that “ the tourists think that they found something to complain and a probability to get refunded .”
2	economy_car_rentals have accepted no responsibility for their representative in turkey and have ignored my correspondence , so i can only conclude that they too benefit from charging customers for an intermediate size vehicle and then pocket excessive profits by providing a small lower tariff vehicle .
2	don_’_t hire from these_crooks .
2	easy website to use and order arrived promptly but oh boy !
2	what a difference_between the pictures on the website and the packet !
2	don_'_t think i '_ll be buying again .
2	bought the black waterfall foam - great product .
2	wouldn_'_t hesitate to recommend this company - and a special thanks to the after sales_team .
2	jim cooper
2	purchased bsome sailing gloves .
2	one set were slightly to big - not a problem .
2	immediate communication with returns reference and refund of postage .
2	great experience .
2	i cant_fault the service from_start to finish .
2	the showroom staff were very friendly and knowledgeable .
2	i had to return one item due to damage on delivery and the staff at glazebury were also excellent .
2	waited in for engineer but no show and no service .. called them and was passed around but although promised a callback it never happened ... so tonight after_reading all these reviews cancelled my order ... been transferred to the phiilapines / uk and bangalore ...
2	just to cancel ..
2	will take the advice of cancelling any direct_debits - even_though i have never had service ..
2	think i have had a lucky_escape ...
2	cover fits_perfectly .... especially pleased as due to the rarity of the car it was made from photos ...
2	:-)))))
2	this is the second time i have used this service in 0_weeks having just put 0 new tyres on my wifes vw beetle convertible i am now purchasing 0 new rear_tyres for my merc .
2	the service is simple and very efficient , with good value tyres with fitting , valves and all other extras included ( which isnt the case with other_sites ).
2	high recommended .
2	the navigation within the site is easy , stock variety is amazing but delivery is nothing short of exceptional , i always come to e buyer first they simply cant be_beaten .
2	we ordered a suite for delivery in feb , the delivery date was given to us .
2	we sold our old suite for £_000 and the lady was due to collect from hull , she had hired a van .
2	we then get a phone_call to say that our suite hadnt even been made and that the delivery was not going ahead .
2	we had to cancel the sale of our suite and pay her £_00 compensation for her inconvenience .
2	we explained this to the md and he said ' your problem not ours ' a couldnt care less attitude .
2	two new dates were arranged but we had to postpone due to urgent family issues .
2	the we get a letter from ( name ) saying that they wanted to cancel the contract and give us a refund due to us not being abl to take delivery on 00 / 0 / 00 when we are out of the country .
2	this company are a joke , my wife saw red and told them to cancel the order and a refund is now anticipated .
2	i wouldnt recommend this outfit to my own worst enemies they couldnt give a damn about loyalty to customers and they really dont realise that without us they wont continue in business .
2	i placed the order online , the process was simple .
2	in a couple of days my blinds arrived .
2	the quality is excellent .
2	the service is second to none .
2	this is where i buy all of my blinds from now on .
2	very highly_recommended .
2	i have tried many suppliers but for quality , consistency , very fair prices and superb service i cant find any better_than point 000 , i want the best for my clients our reputation depends on it .
2	everything was as expected , very good
2	before you buy from them google nitrotek complaints and read a few .
2	i bought an a00 thunderbolt plane that from the word go had two unbalanced engines which would not even taxi in a straight line .
2	sent the engines back - they could not find anything wrong .
2	i sent it all back under the distance_selling_regulations as faulty .
2	nearly a week_later no replies , no acknowledgement and no refund .
2	fortunately i paid by credit_card so will be pursuing them for refund and return postage_costs .
2	the web_site , speed of service and aftercare are all nothing short of outstanding .
2	this was my first attempt at buying a printer on line and was an_absolute_pleasure .
2	i had tried to buy the model in question from a famous high_street dealer whose customer service was the complete_opposite to that offered by printerland .
2	well_done and thank_you
2	i have used printerland for a few_years_now for all my printer needs .
2	they have always delivered a brilliant service and their website is a pleasure to use .
2	i would recommend them wholeheartedly to everyone .
2	thanks printerland
2	most helpful on the phone if required
2	e_- mails from the company were very clear and in the theme of web_site which i liked
2	my order came in two_days of ordering .
2	this was my first order with this company so i was very pleased with the result .
2	made my daughter happy car repaired in three_days of event wing_mirror smashed off while parked , the part came primed and ready to spray .
2	help on the phone made me choose them out of three others who had the same or similar product
2	james_villas have some great properties but if you have a problem with a property they do not help in any way as you will see from other review sites .
2	we booked a top of the range villa in costa_blanca a while back .
2	we had checked with the company to find the best villa for our needs - in a quiet area near shops and facilities so the kids could be a bit independant , and when we arrived at the villa it was miles from the town on a main_road , totally opposite to our requirements .
2	the villa furthermore was very dirty , the beds were very short ( 0 ' 0 ") and as our boys were 0 ' 0 " and 0 ' 0 " respectively were unfit for purpose .
2	we were told that as spanish people are shorter_than english people the size was normal for the area !
2	the sofa was filthy and consisted of a narrow plank across as a seat which was not only uncomfortable but dangerous as we kept falling down the holes on either side , the only other chair broke the first time it was used , the kitchen was infested with insects ( rep told me that if i cleaned it they should go away - this was in our first day so left like this for us ); and there was a building site across the road and as the pool was in the front_garden it couldn_'_t be used as dust blew across it all day , never mind the noise from drill , men , cars etc .
2	we rang immediately after arrival to ask to be moved or flown home , they had no other villa in the area available and could not get us on a flight home until our due date in two_weeks .
2	we couldn_'_t stay in the villa so had to book into a hotel that cost mega bucks as we hadn_'_t pre booked and what did james_villas offer a compensation - yes you '_ve guessed it not a penny .
2	as i say lots of you have had great holidays , but if a problem they leave you high and dry and don_'_t help at all , oh sorry the rep did bring a desk fan so the windows could be kept shut at night because of the road_noise , didn_'_t go far between five of us .
2	james_villas shame on you
2	whenever we have bought phones through carphone_warehouse there have been problems when it comes to a ) cancelling contract at the end of the term , b ) sorting_out problems with the phones .
2	we always ended_up with a fight on our hands as they consistently state they never received notification of the contact cancelling so you end up paying for numerous extra months .
2	you can never get a straight answer out of the staff either on the phone or in store , it is always someone_else who needs to help you !!
2	!
2	considering you are personalising the cards you would expect them to be much more_expensive than shop bought , but that is not the case and when you consider the price you pay includes postage it is a great deal .
2	i have done quite a few now and the recipients are so delighted and treasure the cards , especially when i have put photos on the cards .
2	they will also remind you to order the card next time so you don_'_t forget birthdays .
2	title_says it all , no_problems ordering from play , items arrive very promptly within a couple of days and it would be hard to beat them on price .
2	i have bought many different_types of items over the years on amazon and the items have always been first_class and so has the customer service from amazon .
2	no_hesitation in using amazon in the future
2	i ordered an fm_transmitter car charger and cradle for my husband on our_anniversary .
2	it was much more_expensive than through other_sites but it did offer next_day delivery at an extra_cost .
2	needless to say it did not arrive the next_day , and did not arrive until the day after late in the afternoon , but which time we had already left on holiday to celebrate_our_anniversary .
2	not pleased , not only did i pay extra for the delivery , but it cost more than through other_sites .
2	update_: i sent an email to the company regarding the late delivery and received a reply the same day apologising and refunding the postage cost so i updated my rating in response .
2	the item i ordered works splendidly so am also pleased with that .
2	purchased a blu_ray on 00 october .
2	told that it wasn_'_t in stock and no details of when it would be available .
2	cancelled order but they still took the money and no refund to date .
2	telephone doesn_'_t get answered .
2	the comapny is a sham and it is about time either trading_standards or the isp '_s collectively do something to stop consumers being_ripped_off yet again
2	excellent service
2	excellent service even over the christmas / new year period , quality of the items hard to beat , and excellent value for money .
2	chose suntransfers . com for my recent_trip to benidorm as they were the cheapest option i could_find that looked reliable , by the ratings and by the quality of their website .
2	being a website developer myself , i could see that this was a well_designed website with excellent usability .
2	on arrival in alicante , the driver was waiting for us in arrivals with a board with my name on .
2	i was a bit_concerned when he took us to a 00 seater coach - but we were his only passengers .
2	for the return transfer , the driver arrived at our hotel on to the nearest minute .
2	both drivers were courteous , well_presented and both vehicles were clean and tidy .
2	suntransfers . com get a sixth point because whilst on holiday they emailed , and then telephoned me , to tell me that i had entered an incorrect time for my return flight and that the taxi pick - up time i had specified was too late for this flight .
2	my taxi pick - up time was quickly changed , and the changes were then backed - up by an email confirmation , and all at no extra_cost .
2	well_done suntransfers . com !
2	just purchased a 0 . 0m clivedon teak garden_bench to compliment the canfield dining_set i bought about 0 years_ago .
2	the customer service person i spoke to was knowledgeable about their product range , and was pleasant and sociable , which always helps in these days of speaking to machines .
2	the canfield dining_set has had to endure some awful_weather over the last few_years yet is is still as robust and usable as the day i bought it .
2	looking_forward to my garden_bench to arrive and hopefully some sunny_weather to accompany it .
2	if you have any concerns about the product , i believe that cyan now have a showroom to showcase many of their products - it '_s well_worth taking a look , and a feel , before_parting with your money !
2	i like the range of stuff that a / r stocks .
2	it is for the cyclist looking for quality and something a bit different .
2	service is excellent .
2	i was searching for accomodation for 0 - 0 feb , after finding what i thought was a good deal i booked .
2	after confirming my payment i realised the booking was for the next_day 0 / 0 even_though i had never changed any of my search dates .
2	as this was at 00 . 00pm i tried the manage my booking bit on the website but the booking wasn_'_t on there ( and still isn_'_t 00_hours_later ), i tried_phoning the customer_services number which was closed but did give an_emergency contact number which was also closed .
2	i then emailed them which i was told hadn_'_t been received and was then told that the email address i sent it to wasn_'_t monitored ( this was the email from the confirmation )
2	i finally got through at 0am the next_day , even_though the website says they are open from 0am to be told i would still have to pay as they will be charged by their suppliers but they didn_'_t seem interested in contacting their suppliers to look into this .
2	i was also told that bookings can take up to 00_hours to come up on the manage my bookings bit .
2	as they use hotelbeds as their supplier you may as well go direct to them .
2	we got a message from the customer_services team a couple of days_later to say that they were going to give me a full_refund and that has_been done so i have changed my rating from 0 to 0_stars
2	i still think they need to look at their 0st line customer_services as the standard answer is " it is in the terms and conditions " if they took the time to look into something i would have been happier even if it hadn_'_t have gone my way .
2	the website is easy to use and navigate - clear questions that i would expect any car insurer to ask .
2	got to a the list of quotes ( from a very wide_range of insurers ) very quickly .
2	top of the list was an insurer i had previously used so had no_problems selecting and completing the process - again , painless .
2	great products , great prices & great delivery - come to expect all these from tennisnuts and they don_'_t disappoint .
2	item , a waste food disposal unit , was easy to order , simple to arrange .
2	it was delivered as promised , on time .
2	it was fitted by a local plumber who had no_problems at all .
2	the ' insinkerator 00 ' works as expected and is efficient .
2	a very satisfactory result , thank_you .
2	my order was a simple on but it was important to my wife and me .
2	the on - line ordering system is easy - to - follow and direct .
2	the order was promptly confirmed and speedily delivered .
2	i am happy to recommend this trader and the service .
2	cheers .
2	the goods and attendant service supplied by my tuxedo were [ as before ] all of very good quality .
2	prompt , efficient professionalism at every_step of the way .
2	on this occasion i had requested a dinner_suit at an exceedingly attractive price .
2	upon_receipt , i was delighted with the items .
2	i had been kept_informed as to the progress of my order and had an option regarding delivery date ; brilliant .
2	in straightforward terms , i have to say that the whole_experience represents excellent vfm [ value - for - money ].
2	used boilerjuice recently for the first time . they were 00pence per_litre cheaper_than my old supplier . ironically my old supplier delivered my oil via boilerjuice !!
2	let them do the legwork and get you the price i say .
2	with their good communication and protected payment you cant go_wrong .
2	they even do a budget account now too .
2	this was my first visit to batterystation & i found the range & prices unbelievable .
2	the service was outstanding & my order was delivered the following_day .

2	love them .
2	secret sales is not overburdened with offers for blokes but it '_s worth staying with as there '_s some really good stuff on offer .

2	first_class service from a new to me company , as a new customer i wasn_'_t expecting the brilliant service so was extremely surprised by the speed of their service which was well within their time frame .
2	would i recommend this company to anyone_else .... yes i would ... everytime :-)
2	uk_pianos provided the research tools i needed and gave_me the confidence to choose an appropriate electronic piano .
2	i am not a musician and was buying for a talented grandchild .
2	after selecting a make and model and after checking prices from many suppliers i bought from uk_pianos .
2	the buying and delivery processes were completely_painless .
2	uk_pianos were a pleasure to deal with .
2	advice was excellent and unbiased .
2	the price was right .
2	what more can i say .
2	i stumbled on gear0music as i was just about to click " buy it now " on ebay .
2	their price was significantly_lower_than the best ebay .
2	the online payment was absolutely seamless ( not often the case ).
2	i was able to easily select an_alternative delivery address to the invoice_address .
2	i received notification emails at every_stage .. and best of all the guitar arrived at my side just 00_hours after i clicked " buy ".
2	i '_m_sure i will use again .
2	i had ordered a car vent mount for a blackberry_0000 ( 0000 ).
2	it was listed for about £_00 .
2	londonmagicstore cancelled the order then re - listed it for £_00 . 00 on both amazon and ebay .
2	on ebay the item had showed 000 sold ..... not for that price .
2	cashing in on christmas !
2	avoid them they are hyping all their prices .
2	can '_t fault the service or price from crooked_imaging when purchasing a hama 000 daytour backpack .

2	i chose standard delivery , which is free , expecting it to take 0 - 0 days .
2	very pleasantly_surprised to find the item was sent 00 hour royal_mail tracked and arrived the next working day .
2	will_definitely use this company again for future photographic needs .
2	i ordered a towel_radiator and straight ( inline ) thermostatic valve set .
2	delivery was quick - by 00 . 00am next_day so full_marks there .
2	sadly the rad had suffered damage in transit , being dented and scratched on the bottom_rail and the packaging & tape was hardly pristine , suggesting it had done the rounds well and truly before reaching me ..... and the valve set sent was the angled variety .
2	didn_'_t bode_well for a good experience on my first order from this company .
2	i reported this via their online foms , where it is possible to attach an image to show any damage .
2	doing that is not very intuitive and my image didn_'_t get attached to the form , resulting in a request to send it before they could deal with my query .
2	that delayed things by 00_hours but the end_result was replacements for both parts being immediately despatched for next_day delivery and pickup of the damaged / wrong parts by the same courier .
2	turned_out all right in the end and dealt_with politely and efficiently .
2	things can and do happen in transit but there '_s really no excuse for sending a wrong part in the first instance .
2	ordered late on friday_evening , shipped saturday via_royal_mail and arrived first post monday .
2	well_packed .
2	good product prices and slightly_higher_than average delivery prices worth_paying for the service .
2	i ordered a sony digital_slr_camera at 0 . 00pm .
2	the price was the best by far after an exhaustive internet_search .
2	this for a very new model too .
2	i chose guaranteed next_day delivery for just £ 0 . 00 .
2	i could have had free delivery if i was prepared to wait another day .
2	i was most impressed that i could specify the exact day of the week i wanted free delivery to take place on .
2	after_placing the order i received immediate email confirmation with the reassurance that i wouldn_'_t be charged until the item was actually despatched .
2	later that day i received a despatch confirmation and a one - click tracking_link so that i could see exactly where my camera was in the delivery network .
2	i also received confirmation that my card had now been charged and was sent an invoice receipt .
2	we live well out in the wilds , some 00 miles from the courier depot that was handing the delivery .
2	still , it duly_arrived just after 0pm the next_day .
2	it was extremely well_packaged and , most impressively my delivery note / copy invoice was in its own ' your documents ' wallet - great little touch meaning somewhere to file that guarantee as well , should it ever be needed .
2	i buy a lot online and this was one of the most pleasant experiences i have had for a long time from_start to finish .
2	i have now ordered several_times from selectspecs , and on each_occasion found the experience to be trouble - free .
2	the selection of available frames is excellent .
2	throughout the process i received regular e_- mail updates on the progress of the order .
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending the company , its service and its products .
2	i booked and paid for a premium_economy flight with expedia .
2	the ticket arrived via_email showing economy status . i phoned to tell them of their ' mistake ' and was informed that i had only booked an economy ticket .
2	i explained that i wanted to travel the day before and by the time ( 0 mins ) that i had got through to the payment screen the quoted price had increased by over 000_pounds .
2	i went back to the website , changed the flying day to the following_day , original price quoted , and quickly booked before the price could change .
2	0 calls later , hours on the phone , being told it was my fault for contacting them half hour after they had paid the airline ( this was within one hour of receiving my economy email tickets ).
2	i have been offered the opportunity to cancel for one hundred and fifty_pounds or upgrade to a service that i have already paid for at the cost of three hundred_pounds .
2	why is this ridiculous company still in operation ?
2	do not use expedia , they are expert scammers .
2	purchased a korg keyboard from gear0music .
2	it was excellent service and quick delivery .
2	when it arrived the keyboard was not what we expected ( not the store '_s fault ) and so rang gear0music and explained .
2	the item was picked_up the same day and the refund processed inside 0 days .
2	i would highly_recommend this store for customer service .
2	works like_clockwork - always easy to use and prompt payment .
2	bought a korg_kronos 00 ( ex_demo ) for a great price and it arrived a few_days_later .
2	very secure ordering over the phone and great staff attitude .
2	good stuff and will use again in future !
2	superb service and speedy delivery very impressed .
2	an email arrived telling_me they would deliver between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 and they knocked on the door at 00 : 00 .
2	can '_t get much_better timing than that .
2	based on that i recommend them .
2	very quick delivery , goods nicely_packed and correctly_addressed .
2	brand_new good quality batteries and cases .
2	i '_ll use them again .
2	i made the mistake of thinking . com would be the same as the store the similarities end at the name , i oredered a £_000 value item for my wife as part of her xmas , despatched 00th00 , signed and recieved 00th 00 , really !!!
2	well not by me or to me it wasnt after a few emails and some form repsonses , i called them direct was told it had been sent by hermes , ( see reviews ) who are just a joke , the signature was ilegible i was told and no printed surname availble good eh !!.
2	i was then told i would be called before 00 . 00 next_day by both the call_centre and email .
2	dept , the call never came , guess_what though the package did .
2	around 0pm 0 days_later had been opened , handed to me with a grunt by some bloke in a motor with parcels lying all over the back seat , ( some opened ) never had to sign for it good eh i could have been anyone , ?
2	anyway i logged compliant with john_lewis got a form response of its been passed here there and around , and the hermes company have been informed big deal , not even a sorry you were not called back or were it was first sent to why it was opened and who did indeed sign for it and why did i not have to ??
2	you have been_warned steer_well clear folks
2	if your reading this chances are your thinking of getting this company to do some home improvements of which , they offer many .
2	a note of caution then .
2	first lets get something very clear i have had 0 triple glazed windows fitted that were fitted to perfection and the units themselves i cant recommend highly_enough .
2	excellent quality .
2	so whats up then ?
2	i hope advanced read this and take_heed because they could be a 0_star company and in there line of work that '_s rare and recommends are even rarer .
2	problems are lack of information no calls returned and worse misinformation .
2	problems started when in my order i picked a composite_door was given a price and guide date of 0_weeks this became 00 and many phone_calls later and a threat to cancel the order the door was indeed ready .
2	the truth apparently advanced seen fit ti quote me on the thinking they could make it cheaper themselves by buying the machine that makes a composite_door well the machine flopped and no one decided its prudent to me any of this , and into the bargain because of there failure to make it it would now cost £_000 extra to outsource i was offered a cancellation but no movement on price very unfair after some thinking and now 00 weeks_later i decided yes ill pony up the extra , was promised the door within a week still nothing after me chasing them and another cancel threat the door arrived and was duly fitted , is this customer service , !!
2	no its not its appalling its only 0_stars purly because of flawless fitting by mcdonald windows sub contractors from linwood totally professorial fitting , as for advanced its 0_star sort your customer service out
2	ordered still not received despite paying for next_day delivery , emailed had no reply mailed again asking were my order is a further day later and another day still no reply and no watch avoid at all costs ,
2	note
2	after this review i finally got a reply and a postal refund and eventually the watch which they posted to my invoice_address and not my delivery address ,
2	if you ever have to return a faulty item as i did in this case a cheap electric_planer with a clear design flaw .
2	then dont hold your breath for a refund , as there refund policy is way over regulated every item has to be sent to a tech lab for testing 00 to 00 working_days_later you may get a refund , buyer_beware
2	never had any_problems with mx0 parts just excellent service and very fast delivery great to deal with been buying from them for around 0 years_now .
2	try them before you run to b_& q they are usually a fair bit cheaper and if you use online the collect service is very good they sell a lot more than screws try them !!
2	!
2	iv been using play for some time and watched it grow and grow it used to be excellent but now its just mediocre really delivery issues aplenty and call_centers that are difficult to get through to , an ever_expanding range of goods to choose from , one word of caution if you buy an item and it gets lost in our great postal_system you have to wait two full weeks before you can report it to play as lost .
2	then you could in theory go through it all again .
2	although to be fair a free replacment is usually sent if this happens rightly so !
2	!
2	not anymore though .
2	heres why greed !!!
2	00_% of all items sold fee , plus listing_fees plus photos plus paypal_fees whats the point .!!
2	and further more .
2	this is the kicker if your a seller and the buyer chooses not pay you you cant leave negative feeback because thats not fair haaa !!
2	but they can not only not pay you but leave you negative feeback brilliant idea ebay !!!
2	whats needed here is competition folks
2	i went to this company on the strength of the testimonials or there site , big_mistake .
2	i sent a small chain away to them the value , the value they gave was some £_00 below my local shop , so i declined the offer it was then as they put it re - offered at £_00 more than the original and still below my high_street .
2	so be ware i guess of accepting first offers and own web_site testimonials , give people an honest value at the start and you will get the business is the moral , ps , i took there " improved offer as for the extra £ 0 i would have got from the high_street in the end i could not be_bothered and i guess someone_who has lots of gold would be so its all relevant
2	i made 0 orders to wiggle before my recent cycling holiday in spain both of them have been a disaster .
2	both orders were not acknowledged by email one was delivered by collect_+ to my local_spar and i couldn_'_t pick it up without the email even_though i had the order number and id
2	the other was deliver 00 days after order even_though i had paid extra for first_class delivery
2	i have contacted the 0 times by email and have not received one reply
2	are they going bust ?
2	i ended_up buying everything in spain at decathlon which i would recommend !
2	excellent holiday booked through full cirle who i recomended to fellew guests at la plange club_med this christmas
2	flowers received in time and as_described .
2	good quality curtains , well put_together , arrived reasonably quickly , no_problems at all
2	i found the whole_experience of shopping with taunton_leisure so easy and quick and the item arrived within a few_days and was as good as_described .
2	i will be back again and have told a few friends already about your amazing prices and service - keep_up the great work guys
2	the tyres were delivered a day late causing a great deal of frustration .
2	when speaking to customer service it was obvious that they did not have a means of tracking order .
2	continually suggested that they would be delivered on the 0nd dec .
2	i was in the garage when the tyres were delivered .
2	all credit to the tyre_fitters as they had had a horrendous morning , where one had been involved in an rta .
2	i question whether i will use tyre_shopper again
2	these_guys are fast !!
2	thank_you for the excellent service .
2	the toner is great too !
2	phone_call 00 . 00 to advise delivery 0 - 0 , and duly_arrived 0 . 00 .
2	packed quite well but ripped where slight bulge in cardboard where bag of components were - no damage though .
2	took a screwdriver_set and adjustable spanner only to find not sufficient , neccessitating a long round_trip to obtain spanner .
2	something in the paperwork to say whats required before opening the box , or a cheap spanner in the bag .
2	ok if you assemble every day you will be ok , but the instructions were poor but i did like the numbered bags to determine the correct fxings .
2	the handedness of the curved leg supports was not evident in the instruction .
2	however once assembled a good table for the money .
2	regards
2	martin
2	easy to use and install , very intuitive and you can '_t beat it for being a no cost item .
2	katie on customer_services is a credit to the company it is the most impresive service
2	i have had from and courrier company in 00 years of dealing_with logistics ,
2	this was standards and ease evey company should_strive to aim for
2	impressed was an understatment it was like having 0_star in a top hotel

2	i allways traveld with sea_france for many_years and was very pleased when my ferry link started up using their two latest ships ( although my favorite will allways be the chezanne ).
2	i find the crew are very helpful , the public areas are kept as clean and tidy as they can be on a ship that is in use all day , the meals that i have had on board have been of good quatity and at a fair price . i also find booking on line a lot_easier than other lines that i had to use after the demise of sea_france .
2	hope to travel you again in a few weeks .
2	my gripe with zavvi was the delivery time .
2	so i was supprised to find my blu_ray steelbook shipped a few_days early !
2	if they keep_up this level of service i am happy to recommend to all .
2	lovely ship great value for money .
2	i would have liked it to have been clearer prior to payment that i needed to be at the terminal 0 hour prior to departure though ( i am sure it is in t &_c '_s but maybe on the payment page would be useful ).
2	also the booking confirmation did not say which terminal i needed to be at for departure , again it would be useful if this information was sent with the confirmation .
2	maybe it should be possible to allow more flexibility for travellers by allowing them to book departure and return for the same day seperately as the published schedule only gave_me a few hours in helsinki before returning to tallinn .
2	lovely clean ship , friendly staff , great prices .
2	overall i am very happy .
2	great selection of dog_foods with prompt delivery highly_recommended
2	don_'_t be put off by worktop_express '_s cheap prices , their service is excellent and their products second to none !
2	we ordered an oak_worktop of approximately 0 meters which we also required to be machined and cut to size , the process couldn_'_t have been easier .
2	just submit a plan by email and let worktop_express take care of the rest .
2	a few_days_later we received a copy of our plan which we were required to approve .
2	a few_days_later we received a call to say our worktop was complete and given a delivery date and time .
2	the worktop was delivered on time and in perfect_condition by worktop_express '_s own two man team who were polite and courteous .
2	i would recommend worktop_express to anyone_seeking a high_quality solid_wood worktop .
2	great products , great service , great prices , i will_definitely be shopping with you again
2	i recently_purchased a bathroom_suite from bathstore chelmsford , all went to plan up until delivery day .
2	on opening the box_containing the sink basin i found the enamel to be scratched , i immediately contacted the store and arranged a replacement which was a 0 week wait .
2	eventually the store made contact to inform_me that the sink was in and ready to collect .
2	when i arrived at the store i was handed a beaten up box_containing my new basin and considering the state of the packaging i thought it prudent to check the sink before leaving the store .
2	on opening the box i found the sink was covered in mud and dirt with deep_scratches all over !
2	when i turned to the store manager for an explanation his answer was " well it is from our budget range what do you expect " this left me not only furious but also in an awkward_position as i had already installed the bath and toilet , i could not wait another 0_weeks for another replacement so i was effectively forced to keep my old sink .
2	hence to say , i will never ever buy anything from bathstore chelmsford or any other bathstore outlet again , they are nothing short of crooks dealing in second rate and damaged stock , their staff are rude , unhelpful with no morals .
2	avoid at all costs
2	i ordered flowers on 0 . 00 . 00 for my mother '_s birthday which was on 00 . 00 . 00 . the cost of the flowers was £_00 . 00 to which they added £ 0 . 00 for same day delivery even_though i had ordered 0 days in advance .
2	on the 00 . 00 . 00 they didn_'_t arrive so i sent an email to iflorist which was greeted_by a holding reply saying that the florist had delivered . i knew that the delivery address had been occupied all day and that they had not delivered .
2	i sent several emails asking for proof of delivery and nothing more has_been heard from this company - i must also state that i was unable to contact them by phone because that facility was not available .
2	my advice to anyone_thinking of using this company is don_'_t .
2	they are very good at taking your money but useless at delivering flowers .
2	excellent , friendly service from the word go , i was kept_fully_informed by telephone and e_- mail at all times .
2	delivered fully on all_aspects .
2	i would highly_recommend age_partnership for any service they provide .
2	customer reference_000000
2	how else can you say perfect !
2	what a good company , fast delivery , quality products , friendly staff comunications and to top it all , value for money .....
2	our wild_birds says ' thank_you ' too
2	€ 00 . 00 for " out of hours " at 0000 !!!!
2	!
2	charged for damage that was not done during hire , was even checked when car was returned !!
2	!
2	europcar mallta are complete thieves , avoid like the plague , real con_men .
2	great supplier , would recommend to anyone who is looking for
2	hard too find items and current tech at great prices .
2	must_admit , i did receive one wrong item on my last order , but i can can make use of it anyway and we all make_mistakes .
2	highly_recommended *****
2	sarah_h was excellent sorted problem nae bother
2	a quick service and a good strong and study case for carrying all those needed bits around when gigging .
2	quick and good
2	excellent value for money , good quality , great fit with accurate sizing , i went for the gold package which included tuxedo , trousers , dress_shirt , bow_tie , cummerbund , and cuff_links , also included was a quality suit bag .
2	opted for the free delivery which can take 0 days , items arrived the next_day !
2	!
2	returned to order dress shoes a couple of days_later , again great value for money , again went for free delivery , 0 days , again items turned_up the next_day .
2	hassle_free , does what it says on the tin , with a range of styles and prices .
2	this is a great great deal and one that will suit everyone who want to pay a decent price for such a great service
2	as i call them , over priced , un friendly staff ... not a great place at all
2	very poor in my area .
2	you even get points when you buy food , which we used to do every friday , i spent my points on something and i am still_waiting for the goods ( 0 years nearly ) everytime i ask they say they are still sorting it out .
2	delivery was slow and so the food was cold
2	great to design your own cards and cheap and delivered on time too
2	at the moment we are with bt for broadband and after a slow start and a bit of pushing we are up to speed 00mg download ... brilliant
2	ideal if your a chav ... tacky stuff
2	i love asda .
2	it is my first choice of supermarket .
2	i can get everything i want from there , come home and the next_day check to see how cheap they were , we have had some money back from them and at the moment if you spend over £_00 you get a fiver off your next shop .
2	the staff are always friendly , the shop clean and i just love it as i said
2	argos are good on somethings and i find if you have a problem you have a better chance to take items back with ease
2	best ever search_engine you can get , including maps which is just amazing
2	you can get some good stuff and some bad stuff on here , you have to just beware of what you buy .
2	ease of paying is good , help is not so good
2	i use amazon alot for all most everything i buy .
2	the postage_costs and bargains are really good
2	ordered and delivered very quickly .
2	can '_t use on mother - in - laws toilet as wrong type of fittings , my problem not yours .
2	the product and price was just perfect .
2	will use again .
2	i had no_problems with exchanging my friends 0 phones for some pocket money for her .
2	choose the phones to be recycled and printed_off my form , posted in the postbox and 0 days_later cheque arrived .
2	fantastic
2	so_far i '_m up to about 00 emails to this company trying to sort_out a refund .
2	they failed to deliver on time so i cancelled as per distance_selling_regulations .
2	they tried to deliver on a later date and forged my signature for the delivery - i was twenty miles_away in a meeting at the time .
2	i haven_'_t had a single useful response from asos , good luck finding their phone number but here is an address to write to :
2	asos head_office
2	greater london house
2	hampstead road
2	london , nw0 0fb
2	united_kingdom
2	i used this company to send flowers to my wife , for a very important anniversary .
2	they didn_'_t arrive on the day & when they did arrive , looked nothing like the web display .
2	i complained but no satisfaction was given , this company doesn_'_t care about repeat_business , there are plenty of other mugs to bite .
2	bought two front tyres & had them fitted by one of their so called expert tyre_fitters .
2	within two_days my front off side tyre decided to remove itself from the wheel_rim on the m00 motorway .
2	i had the tyre inspected by a independent tyre_fitting company ( ruislip tyres ) who told me the old valves were not replaced & had failed .
2	blackcircles retrieved the tyre for inspection & told me that they would contact me when they knew more .
2	never_heard a thing for 0 months , so i contacted them , they just told me there was nothing wrong with the tyre .
2	the tyres they sold me were very dangerous & the fitting_station they recommended was rubbish .
2	havent plumbed in yet but came quickly and looks good
2	bought 0 toilets , 0 sinks and a tap a few weeks back .
2	was emailed to say would be dispatched last monday , but then nothing .. no one picks_up the phone or answers emails !
2	after quite a few attempts managed to get through and insisted on speaking to their sales_manager , who is alex featherstone .
2	he promised me that someone would get back to me yesterday , no one did .
2	terrible company .
2	it has a premium_rate number for after sales which just seems like a scam .
2	i '_m not sure i trust the positive_reviews on here .
2	car got written off and hatch_bag survived .
2	they sent me new velcro_strips for about £ 0 so all good .
2	the electric_kettle i purchased was the best price available - after extensive_searching .
2	the service was excellent :- prompt communication and speedy delivery .
2	very good service , with good selection of quality products , thank_you
2	just thought i would try the site and found just what i wanted and saved quite a bit of cash , cant_ask for more than that , brill site , cheers
2	got the system i paid for .
2	the support guys are spot on .
2	have not had a problem yet .
2	the part where i can go online and check my business is perfect for me .
2	i got cloud on my phone and now cloud on my till .. what next >?
2	cloud on my watch .
2	the support_team have been perfect cant_fault them .
2	i get all my high_quality prints done here , they double_check when it looks_like i '_ve made a mistake and they make adjustments to prints when it looks_like they are too dark sending me all the variations to allow me to take the best .
2	i trust them implicitly with my printing .
2	great price and very good service open and honest about delivery .
2	even said if i could get the camera else where then they would cancel the order .
2	was e_- mailed and received a text_telling_me when delivery would happen .
2	very helpful on the phone .
2	i '_ve_used alpha_rooms a few_times now and never had an issue or cause for concern .
2	nice low deposit to secure booking and always seem to be best price on hotel too !
2	what more do you want ?
2	have had the unit playing since it arrived what a great tone and sound
2	phoned through an order to their wellington somerset branch and it all arrived next_day on a pallet .
2	it was all wrapped up well .
2	every thing arrived undamaged a real credit and also at a price that round here no other builders merchant could beat !
2	was able to order easy and also using a 00 percent_discount_code made the prices cheaper_than [_link ].
2	although i did not see the manufactory company for the parts on the web_page .
2	ordered on friday came on monday very pleased could just update their delivery progress though when checked it still said in progress ?
2	instead of dispatched so i was unsure if it would come that day or not however a very helpful email reply to me from customer_services .
2	over great
2	easy to order with next_day delivery plus there is a 00 percent_discount fab !
2	easy to to follow web_page instant_quote no misleading bits .
2	price was best i could_find with free guarantee on the tyre .
2	fitting_centre very close by excellent
2	came_across the company on google and can only reiterate all those who have given this company top_marks .
2	i work for a charity overseas primarily in africa .
2	money is tight but this company offers ;
2	0 ) a brilliant service , 0 ) the best prices , 0 ) and unparalleled back up .
2	i will be recommending this company to all my colleagues and all those that follow me on trip_advisor .
2	second to none
2	ordered radiator which was supposedly in stock .
2	confirmation of order but no dispatch note .
2	contacted after 0 days with great difficulty 0000 number - told not in stock awaiting delivery ( still showed in stock online ).
2	eventually got 00000000000 number ( why do amazon customers get an_alternative to the 0000 number ) and spoke to team_leader .
2	offered alternative which was delivered next_day .
2	just what i wanted , at a price i wanted to pay .
2	delivery was almost next_day .
2	fantastic service
2	the items arrived the next_day and my wife was so pleased .
2	the second time i have used this company and the service ( and prices ) have been excellent
2	great communications with fast delivery and good prices , i would definitely use the company again .
2	jjust got these fitflops trainers from shoetique - really pleased !
2	service was fast , price was great , and love the shoes .
2	which will probably never be off my feet until they fall_apart !
2	prompt delivery of my order ( toothbrushes , toothpaste , cough remedies , interdens - nothing exciting !)
2	at a very reasonable price - couldnt be better
2	waiting if it '_s work and if i will gaive a good coment
2	had 0 failed_collections for the same package so had to talk to them online and sort it out .
2	becky , the rep , was very helpful and rebooked it with a different courier on an express service and sent details to my customer to help smooth the situation over .
2	fingers_crossed this will go smoothly , thanks again .
2	just excellent from_start to finish .
2	the website is clear , user - friendly , and provides all the information one needs - unlike many of the competitors in the field whose websites strikingly and irritatingly withold price information .
2	the checkout_procedure has , like the website , been properly thought through and effectively anticipates places where the process can be made easier for the customer - a nice_touch which speaks_volumes about customer_care and attention to detail .
2	delivery was perfect : the worktops arrived exactly when they were requested for , with a text from the delivery van giving 00_minutes notice of arrival .
2	the product - bamboo_worktops - are exactly as_described on the website : very high_quality , very substantial , and with a great " feel ".
2	very thorough and helpful fitting and aftercare advice provided without having to be requested .
2	it was a pleasure_doing_business with this company and i would recommend them without_hesitation .
2	this is the second time i have ordered from the company and it has_been a repeat experience : marketing , price , service and efficiency have all been perfect .
2	a rare and refreshing experience .
2	i will use this company again with no hesitiation and recommend them without_any reservations .
2	really easy to use answer emails very quickly , lots of imfo on web
2	this business has_been operating for over 00 years in sevenoaks .
2	projects range from multimedia disks / school plays / corporate promotion / web video / conferences / art shows / gallery info - anything that moves or can be animated .
2	don_'_t take my word for it , please read the other reviews here .

2	i ordered a banner ( olympic torches ) 00ftx0ft and sent graphic file in of the words as i wanted them wavy .
2	got proof back same day .
2	there was a concern about slight pixilation around word edges , and an offer of them to re - do it for me if they knew the typeface .
2	no mention of extra_cost either .
2	as it was 0pm , they said they could still do it and have it out for the next_day ( monday ).
2	i missed the email until 0pm , but had ordered ahead as needed it for wednesday .
2	i sent new , larger file .
2	on monday got the proof .
2	ok ' d it .
2	tuesday it arrived .
2	good communication .
2	great banner !
2	very efficient service .
2	i will use them again .
2	read the reviews and stay clear .
2	i would not spend a penny with a retailer that has so much out of date stock ( over a year to two years ).
2	do not trust anything they say .
2	do not part with any money .
2	tesco have an offer on at the moment , buy a 00 pack of coke and get 0p off a litre of fuel , use up to 0 0p off vouchers per fuel transaction .
2	the wife and i bought 0 x 00 packs of coke and recieved just 0 voucher so we complained to be told " oh no you only get one voucher for with coke on each transaction !
2	so i had them credit me for two packs of coke and then bought them again in 0 transactions .
2	each extra transaction attracts a charge upon tesco from the card_issuer so they actually ended_up making less money than they would have done if they didn_'_t have the silly rule in the first place !
2	is it any wonder that this country is going down the pan ?
2	the price was good and included free delivery but unfortunatly the feliway was simply thrown into a bag in it '_s flimsy outer_box .
2	by the time it arrived the evaporator had been damaged and the bottles of pheromones had leaked a little .
2	i didn_'_t return it because the cat was going frantic and i needed to get it in and working otherwise i would have done .
2	shame really as i would like to have dealt_with them again if only for the good price .
2	i shop for supplements online as i reach my last bottle and find the supplement_warehouse is always the best price that i find .
2	after 0 - years i should just go to their website and order but i always shop to be sure .
2	the service is great so don_'_t hesitate to buy from supplement_warehouse !
2	quick service delivery and price less paying .
2	i had two parcels with yodel today .
2	one to be collected from a third_party address and one delivered to me .
2	the delivery was a 0 day service and scheduled for today - yodel completely failed on that one , so fingers_crossed they will deliver tomorrow .
2	they also failed to collect from the third_party .
2	chelsea at p0g was on hand to reschedule collection for tomorrow and change the collection address - excellent service ........
2	........... a contrast to yodel - i paid extra for their 00 hour service rather_than use my usual cheap courier , myhermes .
2	i won_'_t be doing that again !
2	!.
2	as my car was off the road with a broken alternator , i was urgently requiring a replacement .
2	i sourced one and paid extra money for next_day delivery through interlink_express .
2	a text arrived confirming delivery between 00 . 00am and 0 . 00pm .
2	when the part had not arrived by 0 . 00pm i went online and checked the tracking .
2	interlink_express have been to my house several_times before but the tracking said that the address could not be found .
2	no attempt had been made to phone me at any stage so i called the local_depot at plymouth .
2	i was told that the driver was an agency driver and ' you know what they are like '.
2	he would be coming_back later to deliver and has my telephone_number if there is a problem .
2	when the part had still not arrived by 0 . 00pm i called again to be told that the part would definitely be delivered today .
2	needless to say it is now past 0 . 00pm and no delivery or phone_call .
2	far too late to fit an alternator outside anyway .
2	i am out tomorrow so who_knows what will happen .
2	the trader i bought from has_been informed of this failure and is very unhappy .
2	it seems there have been other problems .
2	poor service but much worse than that unprofessional behaviour and dishonesty .
2	i ordered the goods on sunday , they arrived on wednesday .
2	now that '_s what i call great service .
2	if only all companies would look after there customers like this , i will be looking to this company again .
2	i have used facewest for a while now , and the service is always spot on .
2	my goods have always arrived quickly and the facewest rewards_scheme is a very nice bonus .
2	one of the best outdoor shops on the internet .
2	we used dial a flight to organize and book a holiday in marrakech to celebrate_our 00th_wedding_anniversary .
2	our consultant mike was exceptionally helpful and spent a lot of time to make_sure all was perfect .
2	the trip went_smoothly with no_hitches , flights were fine , transfers were all on time and the riad was just fantastic , and oasis of calm in the midst of the mayhem that is marrakech .
2	i have another trip booked with them to thailand in november and on this experience i fully expect it to be plain_sailing .
2	i would not_hesitate to recommend this company and mike in particular !
2	recently returned from holiday only to realise i had less_than 0 days supply waiting at home .
2	my heart_sank at the prospect of breaking out the old goggles .
2	but lenstore performed amazingly .
2	i ordered online and they were dispatched the same morning !!
2	arrived next_day too .
2	i can say no more .
2	well priced , easy to use website and superhuman delivery .
2	used site a few_times for cover when abroad as it '_s a lot cheaper_than getting the excess_insurance through the car_hire company .
2	easy to book - confirmation arrives straight_away .
2	so_far i '_ve not had to claim !
2	i knew what i was after and shopping round tyre_shopper was the best deal ; coupled_with a national_tyre_centre being local for fitting the whole_process was easy .
2	very impressed with the amount of information you receive about your order .
2	you ' re informed every_step of the way and at each_step the email is presented as if it '_s been written by the item you bought - rather_than a bland and generic ' corporate ' email i had my headphones telling_me itself that it '_ll be with me soon !
2	quirky , unique and a nice_touch !
2	obviously not groundbreaking but certainly different and all the more pleasant to do buy from them .
2	received order quickly and packaged well .
2	no_fuss at all .
2	what more could you ask for ?
2	instead of having to buy an upgraded product , in my case my ebook reader that was having troubles holding a charge , i looked into replacing the battery .
2	best battery supplied the correct battery and installation was straight_forward .
2	i have saved a great deal of cash on not having to buy a new kindle .
2	cloud0vaping provides for every_conceivable need of the electronic smoker .
2	their web_site is an_aladdin '_s cave , where you will find much more than you were looking for .
2	the order process works like a breeze , and orders are dispatched on time and in excellent condition .
2	when , as sometimes ( but very rarely ) happens , goods are defective , then the situation is quickly and effectively rectified .
2	all in all , a pleasure to do_business with , and one of my first choices of supplier .
2	orderded a helikon wombat bag .
2	the bag arrived the next_day and is superb .
2	couldn_'_t be more pleased , already ordered more kit from them .
2	placed my first order with gjw_titmuss last_week .
2	i ordered a 00kg_bag of orijen adult dog_food and received it the next_day .
2	the price was very competitive compared to other_suppliers .
2	will_definitely shop with gjw_titmuss again , excellent service thanks .
2	i bought a berghaus_rucksack via the simply_hike website and the service from them was excellent .
2	i would definitely use them again .
2	thanks .
2	ordered tools many_times from axminster_tools .
2	their service is first_class , they always keep you informed re the status of your order and delivery is really quick .
2	highly_recommended !!
2	thank_you .
2	brilliant service from wiggle , they kept me informed as to the status of my order throughout .
2	can '_t fault it - first_class service thanks again .
2	bought a buffalo top from nightgear .
2	ordered via their website and received the goods within two_days .
2	really pleased with the service .
2	thank_you .
2	ordered a barbour_jacket for my wife and thought i was too late for christmas delivery because i left it to the last_minute !
2	country_attire exceeded my expectations the jacket arrived christmas_eve and they kept me informed_throughout .
2	a great service really please thank_you .
2	i '_ve ordered three_times now from woolovers and their level of service has_been excellent .
2	their garments are high_quality and really good value .
2	in my opinion woolovers are a great british company and i would have no_hesitation in recommending them to my family and friends .
2	from the time that i placed the order to the time that i received the goods cannot be_faulted .
2	i required further information about my order and the communications were speedy and informative .
2	i would definitely use this company again and certainly recommend it to others .
2	i really wish amazon would stop using these_guys .
2	so many late deliveries and surly customer service , but because it '_s not me that uses them directly that my only option is not to use amazon .
2	which is , frankly , ridiculous .
2	if you ' re careful you can get a good deal , but this place will hide the real price as much as possible and nickel and dime you all the way .
2	the quality of the cards are a bit cheap too .
2	i had quite a few orders from them for a while , but the cards almost always curled , or had shoddy colour_reproduction .
2	the minute you go to a proper printer , you see what quality is like and for not much more ( or sometimes cheaper ).
2	i ordered a top - of - the - range washer_/ dryer from electricshop .
2	they imply they offer a price match , but when i phoned since i ' d found it a few_quid_cheaper_elsewhere , i was told because they offer a longer warranty , they couldn_'_t price match .
2	bah .
2	but they had it in stock , so i ordered anyway .
2	but despite_being in stock , it still took a week to deliver .
2	when it arrived , it was in perfect_condition , and the delivery guys where helpful enough and arrived with a text notification before they got there .
2	overall not blown_away by the experience , but not that disappointed either .
2	would i recommend to a friend ; probably not , but only because i wouldn_'_t necessarily remember the lukewarm service .
2	i ordered nikwax cleaning and proofing fluids which arrived next_day .
2	unfortunately one of the plastic bottles had leaked some of it '_s contents .
2	i rang simpy hike who replaced the goods immediately with no_quibbles .
2	i will_definitely be using them again .
2	pretty scary sending money to a company that i don_'_t know and it does take a couple of days but it works_brilliantly , i must_say - great service , well_done !!
2	!
2	they did exactly as they said they would - there is no more trustworthy accolade
2	best and amazing price , superb briefing on how to do it , emails at each_stage and then the money in the bank - fantastic .
2	use it - you wont_regret it !
2	!
2	the site was easy to use and the part ( a glass oven_door ) arrived just 0 days after i ordered it .
2	i found that my humax remote_control was becoming unreliable .
2	i bought a replacement from the remote_controls shop .
2	delivery was very quick .
2	the replacement is more robust than the original and seems to work better_than the original did , even when new .
2	the buttons are not as fiddly .
2	the only disadvantage is that some of the buttons have different names to the original .
2	i download a lot of music from amazon , it '_s cheaper_than itunes , and i have only once had a problem , when my internet service crashed when i was downloading a couple of albums .
2	because i had set the download off before i went out , i didn_'_t find out it had failed until the next_day .
2	although the download was no_longer available , one email to amazon had it re - set and i was able to get the failed tracks within minutes !
2	first_class service !
2	i had a prompt response to my email asking for details of a cooker_element .
2	i also had a phone_call from inter - spares , as i hadn_'_t replied to their email ( i was away from home )
2	0 phone_call , to them , and the element was dispatched , arriving sooner_than_expected , well within their quoted_timescale !
2	i couldn_'_t have expected better service !
2	i have no problem recommending wild_bird direct to anyone , the service is outstanding , and items arrive really well_packaged and on time .
2	making full use of modern_technology and communication , housenetwork provide no less of a service than that of a traditional_estate_agent .
2	in fact it '_s faster , and more consistant , but at a fraction of the cost .
2	i '_ve probably saved about 0 grand on my sale costs .
2	ordered some new saucepans for our new_induction_hob .
2	saw these on line and my better half was impressed from the pictures of the goods .
2	ordered on line - very easy and straightforward .
2	they hadn_'_t got one pan but advised us when it was expected and true to their messages they goods arrived on the date stated .
2	have not used them yet but look sturdy and my wife_thinks they are of a good weight and look very nice .
2	so next thing is to try them out when the kitchen is finished .
2	so_far service has_been excellent
2	ordered 000 norton security system for computer .
2	best price on line and company website was professional to give confidence in ordering .
2	placed order , confirmed by email and was received next_day in the first post .
2	excellent service and goods securely_wrapped .
2	have yet to instal as full year not yet up for existing computer security system .
2	would highly_recommend and use again .
2	ordered a tv glass stand for 00 " tv .
2	the website gave clear size dimensions of the product which assisted_me greatly as i had a large av_receiver to add to the display and the diagram helped ensure the stand was suitable for my needs .
2	ordering on the net was very straightforward and delivery was promised next_day by way of confirmation_email and if we had not rec ' d package by 0pm to contact the company .
2	package arrived next_morning .
2	easy to assemble and just as it was on the diagram .
2	company certainly delivered and met / exceeded_expectations .
2	would use again no problem .
2	ordered freezer on line - price was cheapest with a 0 %_discount and free delivery .
2	ordering was no problem and i was able to choose a delivery date .
2	on delivery date ( between_0am and 0pm ) i was called at before 0am to say would be with us in under an_hour - was 00_mins .
2	two smartly_dressed gents ( with ties ) delivered freezer and asked if wanted wrappred or unwrapped .
2	they took away the packaging .
2	excellent service and would definately_use again .
2	i have ordered items from cybercig on several_occasions and have always been stunned by the continual quality of the service and products provided by cybercig .
2	warm , friendly people who really care about their customers and products .
2	a joy to deal with them !
2	every purchase i have made from cloud 0 has_been carefully_wrapped and a toffee slipped in for good measure .
2	this company is fantastic , the products are exactly as_described and the delivery time is second to none .
2	i now have these_guys pinned to my bookmarks and i will_continue to use these_guys as their customer service is brilliant .
2	well_done !
2	i purchased an evic from joyetech and am very pleased with the actual ecig .
2	the control ring design is very poor , it is loose and dosen '_t always do what you wnat it to do .
2	it is slow to start when you press the activation button , the lcd is difficult to read and it seems underpowered .
2	i spoke to a customer service person and they didnt seem to know what they were talking_about .
2	wheelspin_models are just the best at what they do !
2	excellent service , excellent customer_care , excellent prices and products !
2	well_done wheelspin your the best !
2	nitrotek is the best r / c company that i have dealt_with , 00 . 0 % of the time they have what you want , there website is kept right upto_date , and on the rare_occassion that they dont have what you want it doesnt take them long to get it .
2	a superb company .
2	from selecting a new fridge frezzer and looking at the handy demo vidio we new we were on to a winner .
2	web_site is simple to use the information exchange from time of order is superb and the little_touches like the drivers phone number all help to keep yyou relaxed during the order and deliver process .
2	we wont buy white goods any where else from now on and recomend the company with out any reservations . oh_yes and the price was the cheapest on the market
2	i needed to get new electric wheelchair out of house with me on board .
2	gave the step details to the ramp_people .

2	problem_solved quickely and pleaseantely .

2	this started with a very easy ordering service at a good price followed_by a product delivered within a 0 hour_slot .

2	i would not_hesitate to buy from them again nor recommend to others .

2	the guys there respond to questions , quickly and helpfully , and carry good stock at reasonable prices
2	ordered , paid , delivered and communications were all first_class
2	everything_went_smoothly on my first transaction with this firm .
2	i had a query about delivery , but it turns_out after the young_man had sorted it , it was my fault after all .
2	getting car_mats that actually fit your car without paying dealer prices is usually a problem .
2	as a keen cyclist i needed rubber_mats to keep the dirt of the normal deep - pile mats in my bmw but didn_'_t want to pay the dealer price or use cheap one size fits all products .
2	carmats uk was the answer half the price of the dealer and just a good .
2	the mats fit_perfectly and do the job - well pleased .
2	hifx is a no_nonsense money transferring service for either large or small_amounts and offers good , competitive_rates .
2	it '_s child '_s play to do on - line and the communication of contract notes and transfer dates is by email and text .
2	you just can '_t beat this level of service .
2	i was very surprised that pc_specialists could build my new computer cheaper_than i could myself .
2	that was the first surprise , the second was how painless the whole_experience of dealing_with the company turned_out to be , a real_pleasure .
2	finally i had my computer delivered before the due date and built to a level of attention to detail that was gratifying to say the least .
2	i would heartilly recommend the company to anyone_wanting a high_quality performance pc , this company knows what they are doing .
2	once again not only did i save_money but my goods arrived within two_days in perfect_condition .
2	my only problem is i now need to buy a new set of wardrobes as my wife has no more room for my jumpers and shirts .

2	the guy i spoke to couldn_'_t have been more helpful in arranging replacement part without me having to incur further cost .
2	it also arrived within_00hrs whilst i still had the kitchen fitters in so they could install the new lighting .
2	will_certainly use simple_lighting again and would recommend to friends and family .
2	fast service and a pleasure to deal with .
2	the nikon_d0000 came a day earlier_than predicted and is a joy to use .
2	the only_snag is that the included instructions were in an unfathomable oriental script , but i have downloaded an english_version from the net , so problem_solved .
2	i was so pleased with my washing_machine purchase from aol that i bought a condensing dryer as well .
2	quick delivery .

2	bought set dining_table & 0 chairs .
2	when got home realised they had sold me 0 sets of 0 chairs .
2	in showroom placed round table so not noticable .
2	didn_'_t point this out when selling then said my fault for not noticing .
2	now in hands of small_claims court .
2	seller refused to speak to trading_standards .
2	i find the website easy to navigate and you always get a good price and if willing to wait for delivery get even better deal .
2	no_probs using site and was able to get xbox_gold for a good price and immediate activation .
2	yes building up of credit may help to pay for higher bills in colder months .
2	yes i understand that .
2	however having £_000 or more in credit in april after having paid the big winter bill needs to come_back to me .
2	i will be paying all during the warmer months which builds up substantial credit and i continue to pay during the winter_months which contributes greatly to the big winter bill .
2	the money left after the ' big ' billing is in excess and why do i then need to jump_through_hoops ( 00 days to ' prepare ' this final ' big ' bill , although a lady on line previously worked it out with given meter_readings , in 0 minutes !!
2	), including emailing to ask for the money back when they can clearly see the over - payments are in excess .
2	also the online bill is hopelessly out of date and no record of meter_reading i have given , what '_s the point of having this ( yesterday '_s ) information for me to peruse ?
2	get your act_together npower !
2	oh hang on , you have , that is , it '_s all ' protocol ' couched in your favour !
2	!
2	very useful courier alternative !
2	the service was fantastic from a a family run business .
2	the web_site easy to use , good communication_throughout and delivered as promised within the time_slot_allocated .
2	was told it would be here between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 was there by 00 . 00 !!!
2	not only that the price was better_than any high_street or on line provider for my dualit_kettle .
2	would recommend to everyone and use again .
2	arrived in a few_days , great communication , i will_definitely use again .
2	thanks
2	internet site easy to use and easy to find my required ram .
2	really quick postage and reasonably_priced .
2	a pleasure to do_business .
2	really pleased .
2	i bought a voucher via amazon local for a 00 page photo_book and was delighted with the ease of making it , the online order tracking and quick delivery .
2	and delighted to get the offer of making an online version of the book available to family & friends in advance of the real thing being delivered .
2	recommended .
2	bought a 00x00cm wall art print via a voucher from amazon .
2	great value and i '_m pleased with the quality .
2	pretty quick too .
2	lost our freesat remote - ordered one at 0 . 00pm thursday_afternoon - arrived first thing saturday_morning .
2	it works_perfectly and i think its better_than the one that came with the box originally !
2	!
2	hadn_'_t heard of mark '_s electrical beforehand so always a bit_sceptical to trust a a website offering a product some ₤ 00 cheaper_than anywhere_else and only having 0 in stock .
2	however , the website is extremely well set out and pretty_much the only one i could_find that clearly explain additional services such as recycling .
2	decided to phone in the order to make_sure i was getting the product i wanted ( bosch_dishwasher ) and it was indeed a the price quoted .
2	there ended any concern , great assistance from cristian who took the order without_any fuss & explained the delivery process .
2	you receive full email details with clear delivery instructions together with the name of the driver and a two hour time_slot with 00mins advance_notice .
2	sure_enough everything_went as explained with kevin turning_up bang on time and wearing branded uniform .
2	very professional from_start to finish setting a high_standard for customer service and value .
2	will_certainly recommend mark '_s electrical going forward and will shop with them in future .
2	never ever again .
2	after registering our newly formed business , getting premises to trade from we are finding it hard to find a non credit business account .
2	the accountants who dealt_with everything for us guaranteed us excellent service from natwest and to go with them .
2	day 0 - received a call from a account_manager at natwest , i was in a meeting and could not take the call so she left a message_saying she would call back in 00_minutes and if she could still get hold of me she would call me the following_day .
2	day 0 - received a call from the same lady saying we were missing each others calls , this is absolute_rubbish , i have no number to call her so how could i call and i have received no missed calls .
2	anyway she said they could a conference_call with myself and my business partner as we could not go to natwest .
2	a time was made , i would have to travel 00 miles in order for us to be together to make this call .
2	day 0 - drove 00 miles and no call came , waitied for an_hour and still no call .
2	bottom_line is if natwest deals with us like this before we join them what on earth are tyhey going to be like if we join them .
2	they obviously do not need the business .
2	never ever again and i am going to make_sure that everyone i know never uses this company .
2	i made a mistake after having 0 options for my flight back from sa in 0000 .
2	i pressed the wrong option so i have a 00hr wait in cairo instead of a 0_hr wait .
2	i realised the mistake as soon as i received my confirmation emauil , not the tickets , just a confirmation of payment .
2	i then emailed them immdeiately and asked them to change it .
2	an_hour later my e ticket came through with no chnages .
2	i then phoned and the guy on the phone said he could not help me and just pout the phone down .
2	i phoned back and spoke to a 0nd guy_who said it would cost me £_00 . 00 per_ticket , i explained the emails to him and he did not want to know so i said goodbye and explained i would never use them again .
2	i then emailed them asking to chnage the flights and i would pay the £_00 . 00 per_ticket .
2	0 hrs later i got a reply saying it was not £_00 . 00 but in fact over £_000 to change .
2	i then emailed them back and explained my 0st email before the issue of the tickets and have not had a response .
2	there must be something we can do about this aweful company .
2	for most of us " priority express delivery " means that the delivery would be given prority and be an express delivery , well that is not what it means to seapets .
2	to them it means " we will take your money and deliver when we feel like it ".
2	that is what it should say on their checkout basket .
2	i ordered on wednesday , paid the extra for the " express " service , phoned on friday asking where my product was and was told it would take 0 days .
2	i have reported the issue to trading_standards for the misleading way they get money out of us .
2	i have asked for a refund , doubt it will be any quicker .

2	drinks_direct provided a great service the wine arrived when they said it would .
2	would recommend them to you .
2	got recommended by a friend who says has used nancy and travel house over four times .
2	nancy made my travel_arrangements such a hustle free i recommend my family and friends from now on .
2	they have literally become an extension of our team at home .
2	when homebase have their 00_%_off weekends , that '_s the time to purchase from them .
2	our old mira_shower was getting past it and was needing replaced .
2	found the write up good on the new mira_sport shower .
2	we only had to drill one new hole to fix the shower_unit to the wall , so it was effortless .
2	all the rest of the fixings assembled into the same as the old positions .
2	actually the price ended_up being the cheapest on the net including express delivery .
2	if i need any other expensive items for the home improvements , i will look no further than homebase with their discount weekends .
2	was looking for a z - bed for my granddaughter to stay overnight as she has_grown out of her cot .
2	the description was perfect but was wanting extra information .
2	a simple phone_call to a pleasant saleswoman put us right .
2	so continued with the purchase over the phone as we checked the net for prices and nothing beats this price including_postage and packaging .
2	ordered on the friday_afternoon and received the bed by courier by tuesday_morning first thing .
2	colour and fabric we picked is very versatile for a child to use as a chair also .
2	blends in with our colour_scheme , comfortable and very safe if she falls out of the bed .
2	density of the foam ensures a lengthy lifespan .
2	comes with a zipped cover so it can be freshened up in the wash . would not_hesitate to purchase from memory_foam warehouse in the future .
2	strongly_recommend this company .
2	after having the first months supply and trying it all out .
2	the choice is excellent apart_from a few lunch salads that i was not to keen on .
2	i can '_t believe the weight that i '_ve lost , just over a stone in a month .
2	i '_ve decided to go for a further month to hopefully reach my target weight .

2	i have just received an order from energybulbs .
2	probably the best service i have had .
2	given a precise time_slot for delivery and they kept to their word and next_day too without_any extra_charge .
2	also their prices are amongst the most competitive .
2	in these days of dodgy companies offering to buy phones it is a breath of fresh_air to come_across a company as good as mazumaobile . com .
2	the whole_transaction from posting to receiving payment took less_than 0 week .
2	i have been dealing_with healthspan for years and they always come up_trumps for quallity and service . one of the better companies of todays_market .

2	the guitar itself is all that i expected it would be and has kickstarted my interest in playing again after a lay - off of more than ten_years .
2	on the basis of this experience i '_ll certainly use guitarguitar again .
2	our dogs love this particular food so we always try and buy in bulk .
2	the price is very competitive and and the delivery is rapid and efficient .
2	cannot tell you yet how my partners ghd wonderland hair_straighteners will be but no dout they will be superb just like her ghd hairdryer , she will have to wait_till christmas day to try them .

2	always get my e_liquid from this company .
2	service is first_class and always arrives in a timely_manner .
2	keep_up the good work would highly_reccomend .
2	the whole service was a lot_easier than phoning around garages trying to obtain prices and constanly being asked why i wanted to replace my tyres .
2	gave the advice needed , answered questions quickly and comprehensively , allowed_us time to think it through when needed , communication during whole_process was excellent .
2	ordered camera wednesday , tracking allowed_me to watch it leave hong_kong saturday , and in my hands monday at 00 . 00 am in uk .

2	i was told my delivery would be in 0 to 00 days .

2	this is the second guitar i have bought from them and i will_definitely be back for future_purchases .
2	they are also flexible in their pricing , an added_bonus .

2	we '_ve_used rebecca '_s before for the odd bit of jewellery and popped in for someting for my wife '_s birthday .
2	spotted a necklace which she liked and rob offered us a ' bit of a deal ' on it without us asking .
2	sold !
2	it all went wrong for my bank_balance when we started talking_about rolex_watches .
2	rob knew_exactly which model i was talking_about and had one in stock .
2	he '_s not daft , and offered to retrieve it from the window display for me to handle and try on .
2	some time later , after an informed demo of the watch and it '_s functions , i made the purchase .
2	no pressure or hard_sell from rob - just friendly chat and a willingness to let_me take my time with an expensive purchase .
2	recommended if you ' re in the market for interesting jewellery or a rolex from an experienced re - seller .
2	sent phone to them had to wait a few_days and hay_presto cash in bank so easy and they pay postage
2	arrived promptly and was easy to assemble .
2	thanks

2	always quick to respond with queries .

2	i wanted particular tyres to match the ones on the front_wheels of my rav 0 ( previously bought from etyres too ) and although they were not the cheapest , they were still competitive .
2	etyres arrived roughly when they said they would ( having chosen the day and then having the time_slot preconfirmed ) and were very efficient in fitting them .
2	i can highly_recommend etyres to anyone .
2	i sent my blackberry_bold to these_guys as they gave_me the best quote .
2	but , like nearly everyone_else , as soon as they received it they told me that " due to excessive_wear and tear " they were reducing the offer fom £_00 to £_00 .
2	there wasn_'_t a mark on the phone and i '_m not a heavy user .
2	it '_s so much cost and aggravation to get your phone back you end up giving in .
2	disgraceful scam .
2	there should be a law against this behaviour and trading_standards should shut them down .
2	wish i ' d looked here first !
2	after_searching online for what appeared ages , i came_across the pcspecialist website and was very impressed by its layout and ease of use .
2	i tried many configurations as this was going to be a laptop for my studies , so needed something fast but not as high end for gaming etc .
2	the ; laptop arrived within_00hrs and packaged extremely well ,
2	on power up everything_went well and i installed my office with ease .
2	everything about it is good and the three year_warranty is just the icing_on the cake .
2	well_done to all at pc_specialist .
2	excellent technical_department , prior to me purchasing the underfloor_heating_kit , made my decision that much_easier .
2	delivery updates were 000_%, as was product .
2	no more cold bits in the bathroom .
2	:-)
2	kitchen / diner next .
2	great selection , excelent prices , and quick delivery .
2	what more is there to say .
2	i found the best deal for a new the north_face fleece with taunton_leisure .
2	i ordered it on tuesday and wearing it on thursday - and no delivery charge .

2	need a new pair of boots now : yes , best deal again is with taunton_leisure so i '_m going back for more .
2	found a great company to deal with .

2	not only did i get the best price anywhere but the on - line support and service was excellent .
2	i needed to exchange the coat for a bigger_size ; that was done faultlessly and within_00hours !
2	best firm i have dealt_with on - line .
2	will recommend you to friends and family and i will be back .
2	i will highly_recommend mdp to every company that deals with signage , decoration and exhibition design .
2	it is good to know that they are there for whatever we need .
2	fantastic item , fantastic service , very easy to order , customer kept_informed_throughout the whole_process , if all companies worked this way there would be no problem with buying on the internet , their are a small few , but not many , isme has got to be one of the leaders !
2	super_fast delivery too .... prefect all_round !
2	we '_ll done isme !
2	easy to book , not bad prices , reliable , i always use them !
2	e_- buyer is my first_port of call for all it / electronic_equipment .
2	it is very price competitive and for me the ease of use is the most_important_factor .
2	i must also point to the free delivery on purchases as important to me ( other_sites do not always offer this ).
2	arrived early and done in 00_minutes .
2	fraser was the technician .
2	nice and friendly as well as efficient .
2	recommend him as employee of the month .
2	great service .
2	would think particularly for any women who can be intimidated by going to a garage .
2	simple pricing means you know what you will be faced with before they arrive
2	not happy , because , i got less_than i thought for i - phone . it was damaged in transit while being posted . it was immaculate , when it left me . thanx . otherwise , i am happy .
2	arrived next_day and best price paid
2	received an email with code within minutes - thanks
2	they gave clear and correct advice upfront and the item works_perfectly .
2	i needed a specific_type of drawing pen and couldn_'_t really discern one from the choice on the website , so i emailed cult , told them what my requirements were and they came back to me within a few hours with appropriate advice .
2	the pens i needed were with me the very next_day .
2	this is a fine example of customer service .
2	great range of goods , excellent website , prices are highly competetive and delivery is spot on - they deserve a high trustpilot rating .
2	will shop again
2	the tree we ordered was exactly as_described , it arrived within five days and was very well_packaged .
2	i '_ve just had a second excellent experience with this company - they are very competitive on price , have an excellent choice of product and their willingness to respond to specific enquiries completes a superb retail service .
2	my experience of this company has_been very poor , they just keep sending me automated advice that they haven_'_t got the product in stock and they would not respond properly to a straight_forward email , insisting that i use their weird ' ticket ' system to make contact .
2	i '_ve demanded a refund and will let everyone know how i get on with that .
2	well , so_far so good - i '_ve only booked our flights to canada , but i '_ve got to book the accommodation and car_hire .
2	my experience so_far is very good and i '_ve got faith in doing everything else through them .
2	great price on the stuff we wanted , it came within a few_days , a bit of customer service was needed and everything was dealt_with in a professional and thorough manner .
2	my experience with this company could not have been better - ordered the materials and they came just a few_days_later .
2	great !
2	do not become involved with this outfit - they are refusing to accept written instructions to cancel my so - called subscription with them .
2	they will not provide me with the ' terms and conditions ' that i '_m supposed to have approved .
2	they claim that i can only cancel my ' subscription ' by telephoning them and will not advise what legislation they are depending_upon to insist that i contact them on their 0000 tel .
2	no .
2	they do not understand normal business protocol .
2	their website is designed to trick you into signing_up with some sort of wholly unnecessary subscription

2	i tried to sign up for one of their deals and they refused me credit of a whole £ 0 . 00 per_month .
2	they then refused to tell me why they wouldn_'_t give me credit , which is contrary to the consumer_credit act and also to the advice given by their credit agency , equifax .
2	during correspondence with them , they also referred me to a section of their website which didn_'_t even work .
2	bearing in mind i have two current credit_cards with very little owing on only one of them , that i owe nothing to anyone and that i am in secure employment , i think it is reasonable to be told why carphone_warehouse has acted in such a defamatory manner - they continue to refuse .
2	but hey !, would you expect anything_else .
2	by the way , you might want to use these email_addresses to contact carphone : dunstoc @ cpwplc . com , pearson @ cpwplc . com , mcerlea @ cpwplc . com
2	exceptionally poor service .
2	they supplied damaged goods and they said they ' d replace it and didn_'_t ; then said they ' d collect the goods and didn_'_t , then said they ' d refund my money and didn_'_t .
2	quite_simply these_people are liars .
2	and so i threatened them with court and all of a sudden they want to ' resolve ' the issue .
2	since then i '_ve discovered the ' chargeback ' facility through the bank , so i '_m going to try that before i take ' em to court .
2	my strongest advice is not to trade with these_people .
2	my order was delivered in good time and the product was exactly as_described and illustrated .
2	i was a bit_concerned to read the negative_reports though .
2	very poor returns organisation and i '_ve now adopted a policy whereby , if a company doesn_'_t have an email address on its website , then i don_'_t trade with them .
2	this company doesn_'_t - i recommend you don_'_t trade with them .

2	i would trust shiply more than anyvan . com who do nothing to help if the transport provider takes your money upfront and then disappears which has_been my experience with anyvan . com
2	this organisation clearly knows what it '_s doing and the process was extremely smooth from beginning to end .
2	a pleasure to do_business with .
2	required a new tablet has i had broke my old and very out of date one so searched the web for info and reviews on the latest tablets on the market .
2	after a lot of research i ended_up with two on my list , a cheap and chearfull one and a top of the range one , both sold at pc_world so went to have a look .
2	both tablets i had shortlisted were on display along with others , on speaking to a member of staff about requirements i was shocked that he proceeded to try and sell me a tablet that was so out of date you had to burn coal to run it ?
2	i know you get what you pay for but this tablet that was once owned by noah was £_00 more then the cheapest i had reviewed and the tablet specs spoke for them selves .
2	to me it looked like the assistant had been asked to try and sell that tablet and the needs of the customer came second ?
2	bought the top model !
2	but feel sorry for anyone_wanting help about a tablet and receiving bad information and buying a tablet not suitable , not worth the money when there were better options_available .
2	thanks for the internet you can get all the information you need but you shouldt have to do that .
2	i will keep it short ?
2	has its all been said before .
2	sent all three items back within four days of receiving them after fifteen_minutes on a high rate phone_call i got all the information i required .
2	i was sent a conformation of my two returns but three was sent back with all the correct paper_work filled in .
2	i emailed the customer service about this and received a preloaded email back saying it would be dealt_with .
2	after three_days i had no reply so sent another email only to receive the preloaded email again .
2	i would love to contact them by phone but i '_m not going through that again .
2	ideal world was in my opinion very good and i have shopped with them before , don_'_t know what '_s gone_wrong but until its sorted they won_'_t be getting my money again .
2	keep_up the good work nice to have a voice .
2	thank_you .
2	sam was very helpful and he was very good and very good mick bigley
2	they are very good very helpful and very quickly
2	i am shocked by the attitude of this company i purchased a desktop , monitor etc .
2	the delivery did not turn_up on time , i had to spend 0 hour round_trip going to collect from dpd_couriers , when i complained no apology ( dpd did apologised via_email ) .
2	the monitor did not connect to the desktop , i spoke to them they told me to go to pc_world and buy an adapter , i went to pc_world they did not have adapters so they sold me a monitor that would connect for an extra £_00 and i was told to return the other monitor to them , when i did return the unused perfect_condition monitor and left it in store , i have since had a phone conversation with them and they want me to collect it as they do not have a returns_policy and if i did not they would destroy the monitor .
2	this was gareth in pc_world business sheffield .
2	shocked at treating customers this bad .........
2	the response was that pc_world are b0b so have no need to comply with distance_selling_regulations .
2	saved me money , came to my work address , called when they said they would , my only complaint is that i have seen them done faster on tv .... not quite red_bull but maybe me making the man in the van a cuppa slowed him down a bit .
2	i had bought the wrong product from them ( a pump ), i called them they went out of there way to make_sure that i bought the correct product , which my plumber had wronly advised me to get , they sent the new product to me at work and arranged the old one to be picked_up from there as well .
2	i would definatly order from them again .
2	i was finding difficulties in registering my parcel to be delivered , and i saw the ' live_chat ' box appear .
2	i introduced myself , and sarah ' h ' was there to help me .
2	i found her very attentive and helpful all the way through the ordering_process .
2	i will_certainly be using parcel0go again and if i need to chat , i hope it will be to sarah ' h ' !
2	will_definitely use again especially at half the cost of a vets_prescription .
2	i have just made my first purchase from inta - audio and was really impressed with the very competitive price and speed of delivery .
2	i shall be happy to use them again .
2	website seemed easy to use and goods arrived very quickly
2	such a brilliant website to help with all_stages of specifying and ordering .
2	lee and his_team did an excellent job by using the raw information i supplied to create a top - class cv
2	i have now purchased five watches from precision and each one has_been perfect .
2	would recommend !
2	dave j
2	wil use you again
2	the key worked strait_away thankyou i have a spare now
2	arrived swiftly .
2	the pram is absolutely great .
2	it is lightweight , yet robust .
2	with fantastic manoeuvrability .
2	it folds down to take up minimal room and it looks and feels_like a quality item .
2	all this at an absolutely fantastic price , with the ability to mix and match colours for a custom_build !
2	thank_you pramworld .
2	our daughter is over the moon !
2	i wouldn_'_t hesitate in recommending mick '_s garage .
2	the items arrived very quickly and were as_described .
2	i had to contact them over a small matter but this was dealt_with in a speedy and efficient manner , exceeding my expectations .
2	this is a business that really does aim to please !
2	the item i bought was £_00 . 00 under mrrp , delivery was next_day at an exceptionally inexpensive cost ................ how could it be better ?
2	i would recommend online shopping with uttings anytime !
2	peter ratcliffe .
2	just used these_guys for the first time and i could not fault them .
2	my car needed rather non - standard tyres so it was good to get a god initial idea of what price i would pay online and then i spoke with a guy at the office who was very knowledgeable and helpful .
2	they had supplied tyres for my son '_s car a few weeks before and he was just as impressed as i was .
2	i '_ve purchased many item '_s , over a long period of time , the products are always excellent and the service is second to none , supaperfume deliver a very high_standard of service .
2	thank_you ,
2	david .
2	i found this site very easy to use .
2	stright to the point and i achieved what i required in a very short time .
2	would recommend to anybody looking for life_insurance .
2	nil nil nil stars i have never done a review before but i just had to with this company - i moved in to a new house a year_ago and got fed_up with them not telling_me what tariff i am on .
2	i have now left them and still i am getting solicitors letters from them .
2	the customer service is worse than awful - no reply '_s to emails , you phone they say they will sort it and nothing please avoid at all cost you have been_warned
2	i have been looking for various items to buy over the years and often struggled , but now i have found kenable that has changed !
2	i can now get all of my electrical / optical and pc bits from one supplier at the right price and fast delivery .
2	easy to use website , easy to order and pay , most inmpressed with the emails re delivery , first one said the date of delivery second one told me the time between 00 . 00 & 00 . 00 , you cannot_fault that !!
2	!
2	i '_ve shopped at heinne haynes for quite a few_years ( spent_thousands but don_'_t tell the wife ).
2	the site is perfectly laid_out and feature_rich , the item reviews are really useful , not only about the item but also the service - read them .
2	stock_levels are excellent but if your unlucky then relax because out of stock items come_back in fast with great updates from the site ( they have for me anyway ).
2	customer service is out of this world , no problem is too small and response times and resolution is simply the best i '_ve ever_experienced .
2	as for order filling , urgent orders have never failed to get here next_day but even normal posting often beats other_companies so - called express delivery .
2	everything is always packed brilliantly and i '_ve never received a damaged item , their quality control is very very high , i can '_t praise them enough .
2	ordered a vortex 000 , arrived in record time , email_updates were brilliant and overall service first_class ( although everything was 000_% spot on so didn_'_t have to call the service desk so can '_t comment on that ).
2	absolutely recommend and will use them again .
2	i don_'_t normally leave_feedback on sites such as this but i was understandably nervous_about ordering an expensive watch on the internet and found the positive_feedback on iconic_watches here very reassuring and as it turns_out , highly justified .
2	the point i want to make is that good service is easy to deliver when everything goes along smoothly but takes a lot more effort when things go a bit wrong ( particularly when the problem is out of your hands ) and i am very grateful to chris wood for " pulling the rabbit out of the hat " for me last_week .
2	i had ordered a tag_aquaracer watch in good time for my husband '_s 00th_birthday .
2	anticipated delivery was 0 - 00 days , and i had allowed 00 , but after three_weeks the watch hadn_'_t been sent on by iconic_watches ' supplier and i was getting very worried that i wouldn_'_t have a present to give on the day .
2	chris came up with a number of options to solve the problem ( which included returning my deposit and giving me the contact details of one of his competitors who unfortunately did not have the item in stock either ).
2	after what i am sure was a huge effort on his part chris came back to me to say that he had managed to locate the watch from a different supplier and it would be sent direct to me fedex priority , arriving in the nick of time the day before the birthday !
2	a bit nerve_wracking but i have to say it all came out well in the end .
2	so the conclusion is do order from iconic_watches as they will really go the extra_mile for you , but allow as much time as you can , just in case of delays ( although i think this is probably a temporary " glitch ").
2	all in all i am_delighted with the attention and service i received and my husband loves_his watch too !
2	i have bought this many time and they are very good sevice fast delivery good customer service thanks

2	ordered , delivered , satisfied .
2	if you want the best customer_support in the web_hosting business then unlimited web_hosting is the company to use .
2	super_fast response to raised support tickets and they are always happy to help with any_problems i have faced ( even when its been my mistake ) .
2	their tech_support guys really do know their linux server operating_systems .
2	you would hope that most retailers would sort_out mistakes made by themselves promptly and without imposing upon the customer .
2	not pc_world .
2	i bought a toaster yesterday , but the sales_assistant put through two items at the till .
2	one which i had been considering and the one i actually wanted .
2	a simple mistake .
2	i '_m not too concerned_about that .
2	mistakes_happen and she was friendly .
2	fast forward to today .
2	for starters , had to phone a 0000 number !
2	to hear some disinterested lady tell me that i would have to return to the store in question to have the matter resolved .
2	i actually bought the item as a snap purchase on my way past and i don_'_t live close to the store - i explained .
2	same answer !
2	i asked to speak to the store .
2	made me wait , still using 0000 number .
2	store guy a little more helpful sounding , but in practice the same response .
2	can '_t do anything unless i come_back to the store .
2	i said this is unacceptable .
2	pc_world have made the mistake , so why do you have a system which insists on the customer taking time out of their day , petrol costs etc to come_back for resolution .
2	i said any major_retailer should have systems in place to deal with such financial issues .
2	i gave my till receipt number and asked for the manager to phone me back asap with a solution and insisted that i would not be making the journey ( its over 00 miles round_trip !)
2	to allow them to resolve their mistake .
2	i am still_waiting for that phone_call .
2	pc_world - if you take_note of these review sites .
2	and you certainly should .
2	pls contact the guy_who bought the yellow toaster yesterday at the crawley site , june_00th asap .
2	xxx update xxx
2	several phone_calls and emails later .
2	matter now resolved with simple over the phone card refund by crawley site .
2	this i had been told was impossible to action .
2	why this isn_'_t standard policy for all who have financial issues with pc_world through no fault of their own i don_'_t know .
2	i '_m happy enough now , but the brick_wall i had to knock down to get this simple thing sorted was ridiculous .
2	i certainly won_'_t use pc_world again .
2	this id a great compay to buy rc parts from .
2	no_hassel nothing always seem to have what you need and at good prices
2	i would recommend nitrotek to anyone
2	i will_continue to buy from them
2	no one else could get the part i required but rc geets did thank_you
2	our flight was slightly_delayed but our driver was waiting when we arrived .
2	edgar , our driver was very polite and spoke english well .
2	our return_journey was also a satisfying_experience .
2	our driver george , arrived early which was reassuring .
2	on reaching lisbon a traffic jam could of delayed us arriving at the airport but george made a detour which showed us his_knowledge of the local area .
2	overall an excellent transfer service which i would definitely use again
2	a speedy and efficient transaction .

2	will be ordering all my tyres in future online .
2	really pleased with the repair you carried_out on our p . c .
2	it was so slow and we had problems logging on to the internet but your staff soon put paid to that .

2	i had an inquiry through the company '_s live help system today .

2	go to cheapsmells asap .
2	jamie went more than an extra_mile to help me with plans for a model boat .
2	for the price of the whole project , most other_companies would have just said " we can '_t do it ".

2	would recommend them to anyone .
2	i have to both my sons that have marine tanks .
2	great service .
2	thanks guys .

2	many_thanks
2	call_handler ( forgotten her name ) was charming , amusing , efficient and fast - " just one more question before i let you get on with the rest of your life ."
2	originally chose insure and go because their policy was very clear about what was covered and they were price competitive .
2	happily i haven_'_t needed to use the insurance but think the policy is as good as i have found anywhere_else but with better customer service .
2	swift online delivery of policy_documents backed_up by hard_copy in the post .
2	nobody likes paying for insurance but at_least insure and go make it a fairly painless operation !
2	just a straightforward , fast , efficient , effective service .
2	from the website to delivery .
2	what more does one need ?
2	item purchased on strong promotional_offer .

2	first time usage of lords .
2	good pricing .
2	ordered two osmo products during the afternoon .
2	arrived by courier by 00 : 00 the next_morning .
2	items very well_packed although strangely both tins were dented .
2	this didn_'_t affect usage .
2	i would definitely use lords again and have already_recommended them to others .
2	i have been a shop customer of sigma_sport for many_years .
2	distance from the shop prevents me from going in as often as i ' d like .
2	happily , the website purchase / delivery service more than compensates .
2	i have found it to be fast , efficient and effective .
2	the real deal maker is the free p_&_p on all goods .
2	just makes such a difference .
2	sigma_sport has never been a heavy discount store , but the knowledge and service are far more valuable in the long run .
2	flak_jacket sunglasses bought at a very good price .
2	just what i needed to replace a pair i had lost on holiday .
2	great website , paypal facility , outstanding communication and fast ( free ) delivery , meant that i had my replacement glasses within a matter of days of losing the originals .
2	my first purchase from eyewear_outlet but , as a long_standing oakley user and enthusiast , it won_'_t be my last .
2	highly_recommended .
2	i was delighted with the way in which my first order from the all0cycling website was handled .
2	the order was placed at midnight on monday 00 february .
2	i rec ' d an immediate email confirmation and then , within 00_hrs , notification that my clothing had been despatched by tnt courier .
2	the package arrived yesterday , wednesday 0 march , less_than 00hrs after i had placed my order on the website , all the way from italy to the united_kingdom !
2	this is customer service of the very highest order .
2	i congratulate luca nardello and his_team and confirm that all0cycling is now the first place i will look when i need clothing and other items for cycling .
2	i will also tell all of my cycling friends to check out your site .
2	i found powertools0u in a web search where it had what i was looking for and at a reasonable price .
2	a call confirmed that i was ordering the right thing .
2	advice given on another product led to another order being raised the following week .
2	delivery was rapid and i received exactly_what i expected so i have saved this supplier as a favourite for future use .
2	easy to find what i wanted ; web_site works well ; best price on the web ; good communication and quick delivery .
2	orders always arrive on time and well_packed .
2	not sure about some of the marketplace_sellers so take care !
2	good pricing .
2	always delivered on time .
2	will be using pet_supermarket for all my pet_needs for as long as they keep doing what they are doing !
2	you ' re much_better off using interparcel
2	have used these a few_times now and am still using them , really great and reliable service and , as i say , save_yourself some money at the same time
2	easy to order
2	fast delivery
2	item as specified
2	great service
2	excellent service , fast delivery , product as advertised
2	snow shovel competitively price and delivered in 00_hours despite weather_conditions .
2	fantastic service and value
2	i have purchased online from guitar_guitar a number of times and always found the service given to be fantastic .
2	you can depend_upon the delivery times , the products are well_packed and the item is always a0 .
2	i have also visited the birmingham shop and found them to be extremely_helpful and patient with us ' not so good guitar players .'
2	i will_certainly use them again and would highly_recommend guitar_guitar to anyone
2	have purchased both food supplies and other items on several_occasions and always receive a first_class service .
2	instant order confirmation , despatch confirmation , well_packaged and delivered quickly .
2	prices very competitive .
2	i was impressed at the high_standard of packaging and the material was pleasantly a much_better quality than_expected .
2	delivery was also very quick .
2	workmanship was of a high_standard and i am expecting to have many_years of use from it .
2	it was also good to find it available in a larger_size which a lot of companies do not offer .
2	i would highly_recommend this costume and the supplier to anyone .
2	couldn_'_t ask for an easier transaction .
2	excellent price and quick delivery .
2	i would have no_hesitation in using ironmongery online again & would recommend to anyone
2	how often do you see something advertised at a really low price that turns_out to be a con ?
2	like most people i '_m sceptical when you see a deal that is too good to be true .
2	i '_ve been after a breitling for a while & thought i ' d pick 0 up over in the usa but i couldn_'_t find anywhere that even came close to the prices advertised on iconic_watches website .
2	you can '_t knock back a 00_% saving .
2	after making a few inquiries i placed an order which was delivered ahead of schedule with all the certification & 0 year international guarantee .
2	everyone i spoke to either by phone or email were very helpful & answered any question that i had .
2	the fact that you can pick_up your watch in their store is certainly a bonus if you live close by or don_'_t trust the internet .
2	to sum_up if you ' re looking for a new watch you ' d be mad to go_anywhere_else .
2	i would certainly use them again & would recommend them to anyone
2	maybe not gone in 00 seconds but gone in less_than 00_hours .
2	0st time i '_ve_used pistonheads for selling a car .
2	although i did buy it from a garage advertising on here .
2	could have sold my car umpteen times over , with emails from all over the country .
2	pistonheads is also 0 times cheaper_than autotrader so it '_s a bit of a no_brainer .
2	would most definitely use pistonheads again for both buying and selling
2	when delivery did not arrive on time , first_class , they give me my first_class postage back .
2	very good and helpful .
2	every article purchased was very good , cannot_fault the go_outdoors staff .
2	i cannot recommend hifx too highly .
2	not only is their online system extremely easy to use but payments can be made using debit / credit_cards and the money transfer will be in your bank within a few hours .
2	this is electronic transfer at its best .
2	no charges , excellent conversion_rates and genuine service with a smile .
2	loved everything about the buying experience .
2	swift delivery , excellent product , we bought the power_washer .
2	i purchased a bosch pillar_drill from tooled_up .
2	the price was the lowest i could_find anywhere .
2	the payment system was very easy and the delivery tracking service was brilliant .
2	i got e_- mails_telling_me where the package was and the actual time of delivery which was spot on .
2	i would definitely use tooled_up again .
2	ordered a pair of tyres for my motorbike .
2	best price around and free_postage .
2	the tyres came two_days_later .
2	i highly_recommend oponeo and will use them again in the future .
2	a super hotel , always so very clean .
2	highly_recommended .
2	would recommend to anyone .
2	have used agoda many_times , always so easy to use and good prices .
2	i '_ve changed my bookings on occasion and any changes are handled seamlessly with refunds coming_back to me immediately .
2	great service !
2	easy b ooking
2	just made a mistake with an address and sammie_taylor at parcel0go sorted it in seconds what a star and brilliant service great team
2	i used lensesforhire again this year since their personal service is second to none ... someone hacked into my account to hire lenses in my name ... i emailed them as soon as i found out what had happened ... not a problem whatsoever to lensesforhire !
2	i then hired again and received excellent advice as to which lens suited me best ... leuchars airshow .... 000 - 000 lens was great on my canon_0d .... my best pics yet !
2	0 day hire is almost 0 days ... terrific value !
2	i '_ve_used appliances_online now on three occasions over the last 0 months , their attention to detail and service are 0st_class .
2	the operation of their business model is excellent and finally , you actually get a real live person on the end of the phone who genuinely wants to help .
2	well_done to the management and the employees .
2	ordered this bedside_table to match a previous purchase & was amazed by the level of communication from oakland , the delivery company was excellent , text , email , phone_calls were all great , amazing quality product !
2	!
2	i brought a korg ma 0 metronome , it arrived next_day , well_packaged , with a 0 year_guarantee !!
2	the best i could_find , but also the best price , with 00_%_off !!!
2	amazing deal , great service & would recommend .
2	i saw the watch cheaper_elsewhere , so i used the price match facility .
2	they emailed me back quickly & matched the price .
2	i ordered the watch at 0 . 00pm , its also free next_day delivery , but decided to go for the guranteed delivery before 0am next_day , & couldnt_believe it when it actually turned_up at 0 . 00am !!
2	well_packaged , exactly as_described .
2	with the 00 day return_policy its a no loose situation .
2	all in all , a very smooth purchase , super_fast delivery & the option to return the item if i didnt like it , i would , & have recommended this site to friends .
2	they get 0_stars from me !!
2	!
2	was after a certain barbie doll , which was apparently discontinued .
2	found it , great price , free delivery
2	good service , quick delivery .
2	products are easy to use and give a good finish .
2	i use showroom_shine more as a polish after washing instead of a cleaner in its own right .
2	every time i need tyres for either of our cars i look around but keep_coming_back to f0 .
2	the prices are keen , especially paying online in advance , and service has_been great .
2	really quick delivery - must have been almost_instant_response to the emailed prescription , and much_cheaper_than buying from my vet .
2	this is the only reasonably_priced source on the internet i have found of unflavoured plain whey_protein .
2	that '_s all i want as i find all the flavoured_whey options disgusting .
2	that '_s it !
2	dg
2	order agreed and dispatched on schedule , but the week end intervened - they tried to deliver on a saturday , no one in , so no delivery .
2	today , spent over 00_mins at various time trying to get through on the telephone - without an answer .
2	sent email requesting re - delivery ; no answer there either .
2	finally got through on phone in late_afternoon monday , and the delivery is rescheduled for tuesday 0 - 0 : 00 ( which is really good ) but i didn_'_t know .....

2	i bought this as a fan of davidoff and love the smell of cool water edt .
2	when the game intense arrived and i first put it on i wasn_'_t overly_impressed with the smell but my wife & daughter both commented on it as being " lush " which isn_'_t the usual reaction i get from them ?
2	the reaction i normally get is " it '_s ok "?
2	so it '_s 0 / 00 from me and 00 / 00 from the girls ?
2	easy , cheap and quick ........ why waste time elsewhere ?
2	?
2	the best price i could_find and next_day delivery included ........ what more could you ask for ?
2	some time ago i needed various lengths of guitar_leads - 0 / 0m , 0m , 0m , 0m ...
2	in my search lindy cables popped up - i gave it a try and had to come_back for more ...
2	it is exactly_what i like - no_nonsense high_quality products with a bonus of a nice price .
2	i am impressed .
2	i bought a belcat tremolo , very cheap pricewise , but absolutely excellent soundwise , high_standard built , effect can go from very subtle to extreme , love this pedal
2	also ... very fast delivery , nice price , up to date information about delivery , highly_recommended and many_thanks
2	the batteries were exactly_what i required for my cordless_phones and were delivered in super quick time .
2	not the sort of thing i '_m buying every week but will remember this company and happily use them again .
2	can happily_recommend .
2	bought an elna carrying case for my wife '_s elna experience 000 machine .
2	we opted to get the one for a slightly_larger machine ( 000 ) but it is still a good fit with of course a little more room to carry some of the other bits and pieces that she wanted to stow away .
2	very well made and smart in red .
2	excellent service from gur .
2	speedy delivery , well_packed .
2	will not_hesitate to use them again .
2	a very good company to deal with .
2	a good company to deal with .
2	they respond quickly to an enquiry and their products are accurately_described on their site .
2	delivered promptly and well_packaged .
2	like ed , i ordered my battery ( sony vgp - bps0 ) before i saw the reviews and assumed i ' d thrown my money away .
2	however , eleven days after ordering , the battery arrived , fits_perfectly , was recognised by my lap - top , and so_far , works as it should .
2	hopefully it will_continue to do so .
2	i decided to check the reviews when pay_pal confirmed that my payment had been made to a xianghua luo , rather_than a british company as i was expecting .
2	their e_- mail address is a uk one and they display a post_office symbol on their home page .
2	( the gpo did provide the final leg of the journey .)
2	the company is in fact based in singapore .
2	the web_page from which i ordered my battery shows a picture of a sony battery and i did think i was ordering a genuine sony product .
2	when i went back and read the small_print , as i should have done at first , it was clear that this was not so .
2	given the price , i decided to sit tight and hope for the best .
2	the battery is made in china , appeared to be new , was well_packaged and as i '_ve said , so_far so good .
2	however , if this company wishes to achieve as they themselves say , ' 000_% customer_satisfaction ' they need to be far more open and honest about who they are , where they are , and exactly_what the product they are selling is .
2	in view of this , despite my apparent success with them this time , i should be very wary of trading with them again .
2	i '_m very happy to recommend holistic_shop as knowledgable and caring professionals in the provision of crystals whether for healing or protection .
2	their jewellery items are attractive and can offer 00_hours a day supplementary coverage to the aura , whether as bracelet , necklace or just carrying a crystal in a velvet pouch in your pocket or handbag .
2	your every psychic need will be met .
2	first comment is to say how effective the sealey 0000 btu air conditioner is .
2	i have a 00 sq . m ( 00 cu . m ) apartment , which serves as a lounge , study and bedroom .
2	having diabetes , badly_affected my high heat and humidity levels , and problems with my prostate , it is vital that i maintain good temperature_control .
2	i was amazed that the two a / c units arrived at my house in 00_hours from placing the order .
2	however one or two little niggly points .
2	attaching the hot - air venting hose to the outlet plate is extremely frustrating .
2	i used the advice of one customer who recommended using duct - tape .
2	also i needed 0 . 0 metres of hose to reach the opening part of the window .
2	i had to buy that from a local hardware store .
2	i ' d like to suggest a reducer which would accommodate a conventional reinforced garden_hose simply pushed on to the reducer output and held in place with a hose - clip .
2	trying to get a 000_mm .
2	hole cut through brickwork to allow for venting through the hose supplied is an extremely expensive exercise ; even a 000mm diamond cutter is over £_00 and i ' d neeed something about the size of an industrial kango to get it through the wall .
2	if i have the option to buy a wall a / c unit in the winter i ' d opt for that .
2	they are as quiet as a fan and water evaporates using the vented heat as part of a heat_exchanger mechanism .
2	however most impressed with customer service .
2	one missing rubber bung for the water drain pipe , supplied the following_day foc under the guarantee .
2	the aluminium flight case to hold 00 cds in plastic cases makes_life so much_easier for the well_organised mobile dj .
2	it is professionally engineered to organise and protect important material .
2	no_hesitation in buying further products from electro supplies ltd .
2	i '_m most impressed with the broad tonal range of these speakers .
2	it is so appropriate that the cone is gold in colour .
2	what a lovely crisp response across the entire audio spectrum .
2	i have bought other items for my golden oldies disco from hi -_fi tower because i have always believed since i started as a dj in 0000 , that there is no reason_why discos should cause damage to your eardrums , or sound badly clipped .
2	i have always insisted on hi -_fi quality , even when running 000_watts rms with 000 revellers .
2	so if you want to experience the gold standard in speakers , i ' d urge you to opt for auna from hi -_fi tower .
2	had a few doubts_about using then had little alternative to get a two sweater settee from corsham to burnham on sea .
2	several reasonable quotes arrived and job was done in a few_days .
2	no_complaints .
2	we recently took delivery of a office_furniture package , and the quality and service we received was first_class .
2	very good quality & exalent service , will use again .
2	*****
2	spent hours trying to find parts for my trusty_old scenic 0 around local scrap_yards and had no luck .

2	well_packaged .
2	would use again , and have already_recommended to friends !
2	just had to tell you what a great website this is .
2	it '_s one of just a few places i could get a replacement mountain paws walkies dog lead .
2	my other had worn out after many_years service .
2	the safariquip website is easy to navigate , their ordering system enabled_me to use paypal , my preferred_method of payment !.
2	and my order was despatched almost_immediately .
2	i would thoroughly_recommend safariquip and i will_certainly visit again .
2	i found mobile_fun by_accident .
2	so glad i did .
2	whatever device you have they will have a whole range of quality made accessories for it .
2	their customer service is second to none , very highly_recommended .
2	great choice , great prices and quick delivery .
2	i '_m very pleased with my purchase and would definately recommend outdoorkit . co . uk to anyone .
2	first time customer , was amazed at how quickly my purchases came - free delivery but including tracking - brilliant .
2	excellent prices too .
2	will_definitely use them again .
2	goods as_described and arrived quickly .
2	thank_you .
2	after ordering my vet diet dog_food it was delivered in 0days , also cheaper_than others , very pleased and i will be back . well_done
2	it '_s so easy and you get the money they quote without_argument , no_hassle as on ebay !!!
2	do it you won_'_t regret it .
2	made the mistake of visiting justoffbase , whoops internet only , but within a couple of hours someone phoned and apologized , a rare_thing these days .
2	i did place an order on line , one part came the next_day and the rest a couple of days_later .
2	excellent comms .
2	products exactly as_described .
2	justoffbase do however rely heavily on their suppliers to perform as well as they do , because they place orders on them directly .
2	really good painless process throughout , from ordering to delivery .
2	bought tickets : delivery collection options with 0 days before travel limited to royal_mail special delivery at additional £ 0 . 00 plus i have to stay in between 0 am and 0 pm to sign for letter or machine collection at nearest station with machin which is 00 miles_away .
2	no way of complaining to trainline without using premium_rate line .
2	why :
2	0 .
2	do they think it takes more than 0 days for royal_mail to deliver first_class
2	0 .

2	i have just bought the best looking and performing usb_stick i have ever had
2	when i rang the regency_chess company i had a few questions about their boards and what pieces might go well with the board i picked .
2	the advice i got was excellent and i soon received the board , pieces and chess piece box i had been advised on and bought .
2	the quality of the products is superb and the packaging to ensure they arrived in pristine_condition was almost too good .
2	it felt a bit like being the only guest playing pass the parcel there were so many layers of packing to get through .
2	i cannot give enough praise for the company , the sets are not cheap but as long as you understand you are paying for quality you should not be disappointed .
2	i have no_reservations on highly recommending the company , i wish all internet buys were this well_done .
2	been with heart for years as a hosting reseller to my web design business , they ' re very quick to respond often going out of their way to help me fix problems my clients are having .
2	i '_ve been recommending them to friends and colleagues for ages .
2	i '_m wracking my brains but i can '_t find anything bad to say about them , if only more companies were run this way ( are you listening amazon , bt , all rail networks and the government ).
2	i recently_purchased a computer from cyberpower , but when it arrived
2	the processor fan had slipped during_transit and the computer was overheating .
2	not surprising when the delivery guy just dropped it in the living_room .
2	if it was their computer they would be more careful .
2	i contacted customer_support and after checking the obvious things , it needed to go back .
2	support answered mails at all times even during weekend ( sunday ).
2	it was repaired very quick and i am very pleased with my purchase .
2	with service like this why go_anywhere_else .
2	i know who i wiill buy my next computer from .

2	i now have three different pans , all of which are a pleasure to use , the weight , ease of cleaning and cooking with them makes things so easy . i `_m gradually replacing all my cooking_utensils with pro - cook .
2	ordered crystal glassware on sunday at competitive price - product arrived on wednesday - excellent service
2	one of the problems i have which is not unique is a neck size which is large 00 " and a body rather smaller so when i received the dinner shirt i ordered the body was massive but the collar fitted well .
2	as the shirt is usually under a suit or dinner_jacket i have not bothered sending it back but the ' niggle ' is there when i wear it .
2	the ordering was easy and the delivery at the expected time .
2	the packaging was a black polythene_bag with the shirt inside in a cellophane bag which had been ripped_open in order to put in a bow_tie i had also ordered .
2	it therefore looked scruffy , not what i expected and the overall experience was disappointing which was a pity as i am sure the firm are usually better and will also be disappointed with my comments
2	i needed to send a parcel to the united_states but was not sure what to do . i contacted parcel0go online i was helped out by one of the parcel0go online helpers called daniel fantastic helped_me through the complete transaction thank_you very much will use this company again
2	this was the first time i had ordered from angling_active , but it will_certainly not be the last , apart_from very good discount prices the service and delivery ( all free and within 00_hours ) was truly excellent .

2	thank_you all at ' angling_active '

2	excellent service all_round ordered , and delivered in a couple of days
2	i wanted to know if a blower unit on offer had a shoulder_strap , i was on the sales hotline .

2	just print off your receipt & go , all in all a piece of cake .
2	i know where i am buying all my tyres in the future .
2	do not use this company !
2	i hired from sixt in geneva and on arrival at the desk was handed a print - out for the car , notified i had been upgraded and had a larger petrol car .
2	so_far so good .
2	unfortunately the car wasn_'_t petrol ( modern diesels run like petrols ) and as there were no warning labels on dash , filler_cap or flap or paperwork , i refuelled with diesel on the way back to the airport the company then failed to assist in recovery of car or family to the airport , and we paid for recovery and a taxi to the airport and were then sent a bill for £_000 .
2	subsequently the company refused to answer any_queries on what had happened - no personal communications , just a barrage of automated demands for payment or else .
2	still not receiving any personal communication , i contested the payment at which point it was handed_over to a debt_collection_agency .
2	after 00 months of hassle , i eventually had to pay up 000_euros to avoid having to go through the trauma of contesting this in court .
2	all other car_rental_companies at geneva clearly mark their cars and paperwork - but not sixt !
2	the first time we have used this site .
2	it gave_us a better price than any of the others , including direct booking .
2	illustrations and descriptions were good .
2	having had a previous poor service experience from a rental car company at geneva_airport , i took a recommendation for europcar and followed it up after booking an easyjet flight for myself and family of 0 adults and one 0 - year_old .
2	i selected the largest car in the range , a 0 - seater and it was excellent value .
2	it was clean , spacious , efficient and once fitted with the child_seat , still had room for all our_luggage .
2	the car was also 0 - wheel drive , useful in the alps , especially as there was still snow on the higher roads .
2	pick_up following our arrival at geneva was easy , once we ' d been dropped_off by the shuttle_bus and equally drop_off was completed within minutes .
2	i will_definitely use this company again in the near_future when i return to geneva .
2	bought a few items , they were all in stock and they arrived quicker_than i expected and the delivery was free ., i always browse modelrailwayloft website for their special_offers and have found them to be one of the cheapest modelrailway retailers around , i will be shopping with them again and again .
2	excellent service , great prices and fast delivery ...... a0
2	for your pet requirements , this is the place to shop , great prices and very fast despatch and delivery , highly_recommended .
2	i recently contacted 000reg regarding my website .
2	what i wanted to do was not available under the package i have .
2	so i thought that was the end of the matter but they clearly had other ideas .
2	within 00_hrs i received a call from the help_desk with an_alternative solution that gave_me pretty_much what i wanted .
2	they had even set it up on my site so they could talk me through the process using information that i was familiar with .
2	first_class service that i don_'_t feel would have been as easily found elsewhere .
2	00 out of 00 points people .
2	i like cyclestore they have a great website and prices are sooo good too
2	i needed urgent help for my wife '_s ilr and imperial_visas were very supportive and sorted_out visa issue within a week .
2	the service was outstanding and i would highly_recommend them for any immigration queries .
2	mr agron handled my case very carefully and mr ali took my case to croydon office he is really a nice person .
2	he spent_nearly_half day with me and handle the case very nicely .
2	ordered fox forks and had them delivered this morning after only 0 days .. super_fast delivery and a great price .. no other online shop had these forks at this low price .. give them a go you wont_regret it .
2	the website was clear , showing the value of the phones and the payment options .
2	the recycling process was painless and mazuma provided very clear_instructions and confirmation ( and reminder ) emails .
2	the great service i got first time made sure i used them again and i was not disappointed .
2	they are the first place i would check when it comes to mobile_phone_recycling .
2	ordered the charger plus aa and aaa ansmann batteries .
2	very prompt service , great product , very pleased .
2	located the company through its website .
2	what i particularly_liked about the site was its knowledgable format and the emphasis on quality products .
2	my first order was promptly despatched and delivered .
2	this had a slight packaging problem , not_necessarily just vitamins fault , which when i telephoned and highlighted the issue was dealt_with very promptly and efficiently .... what a refreshing_change !
2	!
2	i have subsequentely placed other orders without issue and having used the products regularly , can comment they are of first_class quality and i have no_hesitation in recommending the company , its products and staff as excellent .
2	very highly_recommended .
2	great furniture brilliant price excellent delivery and easy to order
2	use dpk uk for all your deliveries .
2	they deliver on time and don_'_t waste yours waiting .
2	i have used envirophone for many_years .
2	their prices are competitive and you receive a package which protects the phone and is free to send .
2	updates on receipt and testing completing are followed_by details of when the value will be transferred to your account .
2	above all i have found the service both reliable and trustworthy .
2	the only comment i would make is that , whilst the posting is free , for expensive phones you need to take out postage insurance which costs around £ 0 .
2	wide_range of products at competitive_prices and excellent service
2	bought 0 different_flavours , all a very good taste and throat_hit , delivered next_morning well_packaged , good communication via emails , been vaping a while now and used many different companys some good some bad , will be staying with cloudstix from now , good price good service and brilliant after service .
2	thanks
2	tried them once as it represented a substantial_saving on our usual_supplier .
2	once we got the hang of applying the vinyl_lettering it really is a breeze .
2	we have since ordered another 0 sets of writing for various vehicles and when i have been in a hurry i just ask and they arrive pdq !
2	what more can i ask for ?
2	have recommended the site to at_least 00 others since we started .

2	having made my order i was then informed that glasses i had ordered were no_longer instock and should not have been showing .
2	the only other glasses i like were £_00 - 00 more in cost of which i was somewhat unhappy having to pay full cost .
2	please ensure correct information is showing and not having to re - change order at extra costs .

2	thank_you once more you have done a great job .

2	these_people charge you for mandatory items that are not included in the base fare .
2	£_00 for on line check in or £_00 to check in at the airport .
2	£ 0 . 00 for a seat each way ( regarless of which one you choose , you cannot skip this ) £_00 odd_quid for a bag ( ok i know quite a few other_airlines do this ).
2	the extra_legroom seems a hell of a lot shorter_than most .
2	and isn_'_t cheap .
2	one return flight i bought had a base return cost inc taxes of £_000 when i paid with my debit_card the cost was £_000 .
2	lol
2	british_airways on the other hand are not a budget_airline and you don_'_t get treated_like sheep .
2	same flight with much_better take off and landing times .
2	£_000 base fare .
2	how much do you think you end up paying with meals and baggage , check in , seats etc ?
2	yep £_000 .
2	go figure ....
2	the moral to the story ?
2	don_'_t think the main airlines are always dearer .
2	if i need anything for tunnel frames , fruit protection frames , poly covers or just odds and ends and repair_tape i always go to them .
2	they send off really quickly and you get what you ordered .
2	everything is good quality and they don_'_t charge through the roof .
2	fantastic company .
2	you get to speak to a real_person when you ring them .
2	their spectacles are ridiculously_cheap compared to anything i have found on the high_street and their customer service is second to none .
2	i genuinely cannot_fault them on anything .
2	i have had two_pairs of spectacles from them and will_definitely be going back for the next pair as well as recommending them to everyone i know .

2	i have used orbitremit many_times to transfer small_amounts to india and sri_lanka .
2	the transfer is very easy and convenient to make and always funds made available to the recipients on time .
2	the rates are not as good as some others but still i use them as i trust them more than any one else .
2	we couldn_'_t have had any better service .
2	all ok except the ups delivery .
2	my advice shall be not use ups at all .
2	on one order they delivered to a wrong_address and the next one i was tracking , having had the bad_experience , on the previous order , it was delivered a day earlier_than it was on their tracking service .
2	fortunately we had someone to take delivery
2	ordered a freezer to be delivered at a different address to billing on a particular day and i was very nervous_about the delivery .

2	easy navigation for searching and booking , prompt email sent confirming booking , the price on alpharooms was the cheapest we found , even cheaper_than the hotel website .
2	good site and will be using again .
2	the blackcircles website is excellent , easy to navigate , all the information required on each product i was looking for was available and comprehensive .
2	the on - line ordering_process couldn_'_t have been easier , i was able to pick the product i wanted , in the sizes required , and arrange the fitting all in a matter of seconds .
2	the prices are competitive , with delivery to the fitting agent , was hassle_free .
2	what more could you ask ...........
2	thank_you all so much for your quick solution to my problem of when my parsel was to be collected emily was realy good but my hat gos off to tanya who sprang to my rescue ( many_thanks tanya ) all sorted .
2	go to the top of the class ... nice one thanks again ... mr m galloway
2	i looked at many websites offering deals on printers but printerland . co . uk was by far the best .
2	due to the price of the samsung network printer i ordered it was free delivery and it came a day early .
2	i really appreciated the call from the company to inform_me when the printer would arrive and to check that i had ordered the right model and had all the cables required .
2	they also emailed a today to check to see if everything was ok . you just don_'_t get this kind of customer service with other online sellers - if only more companies were had this level attention to their customers .
2	i would definitely use them again for printers and supplies and wholeheartedly_recommend them .
2	after a mouse got into my old helmet and ate some of the inner .
2	it '_s time for a new helmet .
2	after a lot of checking the internet there was only one winner .
2	so i ordered from sportsbikeshop a new caberg , same make as the old one , and in under 0 days it arrived very well_packed .
2	not a lot more to say just good service .
2	very good service arrived quicker then expected .
2	i will be buying from aquatics_online again .

2	well_packaged and quick delivery .
2	do not use if you are going on holiday and need to take luggage , they will charge you for everything .
2	everything and i mean everything is extra and the standard price will double .
2	this airline is suited more to the business traveler .
2	if they looked after their customers as much as their ceo graves publicity , they would do better .
2	you will never pay the advertised price .
2	when you go through the booking process the extras start adding up . get what you pay for and sometimes a bit less .
2	took up their offer of a free calendar and tee_shirt .
2	very pleased with each but the tee_shirt came a bit on the big size which was for our daughter .
2	offer included free p_&_p so over all very happy .
2	will be using again .
2	have used many_times .
2	the best thing is when you have seen what you want you can check the rating of the sellers so you can shop in confidence .
2	very well_laid_out and clean shop .
2	everything i have needed has_been in stock .
2	the staff are also very helpful .
2	many items have a two year_guarantee .
2	have used these before and have been very happy .
2	in the past we used hotel + parking , never again having to wait ages for over crowed buses .
2	now we just park car and jump on a waiting bus which departs every 0 to 00_mins .
2	on return from holiday the bus has_been waiting to take us back to are car .
2	the car_park is about 0 - 0 mins ride to terminal at lgw .
2	it is very easy to get to .
2	this is the only place i go for my photography needs .
2	their staff are very knowledgable and take time to explain things .
2	they recommend things that you are looking for .
2	they are not always the cheapest but i would rather pay a pound or two more knowing that i have had very good advise and brought the item that meets my needs .
2	local_branch always has plenty of stock .
2	staff are friendly and helpful .
2	competitive_prices and good offers .
2	when ever i place an order , everything is in stock and delivered next_day .

2	staff at local shop are very helpful .
2	have ordered from modelsport many_times and have received excellent service each time .

2	oil and filter changed for cheaper_than i can buy the oil
2	took my mobile into store for repair and was given a courtesy phone .
2	got home and put the phone on charge with turned_out to be faulty would not charge .
2	waited a week for my phone to be repaired and picked it up , got home and started to use it that evening and the phone had the same fault .
2	rang store and they agreed to replace it but would take 0 - 0 days to get to the store .
2	received a call 0 days_later to say replacement phone was in stock .
2	drove back to the store and the wrong replacement had been sent .
2	was told it would need to be reordered and take another 0 - 0 days to arrive back at the store .
2	this is a joke of a company with a couldnt care less attitude toward customers with a genuine faulty phone
2	rang samsung and they have asked me to send it them direct

2	thouroughly recommended .
2	following a recommendation from a work_colleague , i '_ve_used merlin_cycles for a few_years_now to buy lubricants , degreasers , etc .
2	( not actually for a bike , but that '_s not important !)
2	their prices are good , their web_site is easy to use and helpfully shows what '_s in stock , and delivery is always very quick .

2	paul arrived in the time given in his well tidy van , did the job in no time , as well as fitting my two new front tyres he checked the rear ones and put the right pressure in and told me to check my rear_tyres for wear in about 0000 miles or so . first_class job .

2	the whole_process from booking on line to having the tyre fitted was hassle_free and quick .
2	i had at_least two confirmations of what time i had to arrive .
2	no more long_waits in cold garages .
2	i arrived on time , booked in and the tyre fitted in 00_mins .
2	just had time to do some shopping .

2	i elected for a cheque payment and having posted the item , i recieved a cheque for the amount_quoted .
2	no_quibble .
2	i was sceptical initially and half expected them to challenge the condition of the phone and reduce the payment but this didn_'_t happen .
2	other_sites quoted a few_pounds more but i chose mazuma due to its advertising and trusted their reputation .
2	will_definitely use them again .
2	we have successfully used blue_chip holidays before and seeing an azores high pressure approaching the uk i looked on their website and found a last_minute availability which looked interesting with outstanding views .
2	over the weekend blue_chip managed to get the short_break sorted_out with all arrangements working_perfectly and we left on the monday_morning to 00 , hengistbury heights which turned_out to be a very good property .
2	many_thanks to the excellent staff at brixham for a very good holiday .
2	this was our second order and it arrived exactly on time and very promptly .
2	the products were accurately_described and of good quality , we will use greatgardens again .
2	simple ordering_process and fast delivery - all that a customer needs .
2	nothing more to say .
2	my new phone arrived very quickly after ordering but in the meantime its dispatch and delivery details were monitored by lamda tek and emailed to me .
2	since installation , the phone has worked as per its spec .
2	very slick processes both to order and checkout .
2	the tool bars and pot magnets made organising my shed a lot_easier .
2	the range of products is huge so there is plenty of choice .
2	it '_s easy to order and delivery is extremely fast .
2	i use them all the time .

2	well_done guys .
2	i ordered wrong item and after one phone_call to a very polite and helpful guy he sorted it within a couple of minutes and i received the correct product before i could send the wrongly ordered one back .
2	the service and trust from pet - supermarket was like a breath of fresh_air .
2	( top_marks guys well_done and will highly_recommend you . )
2	so called free delivery ......???
2	?
2	i had to collect my delivery from parcel_force depot after two failed delivery attempts .
2	no one attempted to phone my mobile to confirm i was home , so i contacted viovet who told me i would have to pay the delivery costs .
2	i then asked for a refund on the items i purchased and was told i would have to pay double the delivery cost to have the items returned to viovet !
2	in the end i had to do a round_trip of 00 miles to collect the items from the delivery depot as they would not deliver without me paying .
2	i have bought hundreds of items via the internet and never ever had this problem .
2	viovet were completely_unhelpful in resolving this .
2	i will never shop with viovet again and will recomend the same to everyone i know .
2	since i lost my arm in an r . t . a whilst riding a motorbike in 0000 , i eventually gained courage to get in the saddle and ride a bicycle . night times were worse with the traffic and the lights i had , but since i received my blaze bike light , cars , buses , lorry , s even pedestrians notice me or should i say notice the bright_light and the green bike that the laser projects in front of me .
2	thank u blaze .
2	xx
2	really friendly contact providing very helpful information .
2	most comprehensive review of digital pianos that i found on the web .
2	check it out before you buy .
2	i purchased a large_canvas_print at an offer price - the product was very good and delivery very quick .
2	all in all a good online experience .
2	different from other reviews posted , i was amazed by the speed at which my problem was resolved .
2	having purchased a voucher my internet_connection was interrupted during the order process but after the voucher number had been accepted .
2	this meant that the voucher was no_longer valid and there was only one more day until the voucher finished .
2	i contacted wowcher and within fifteen_minutes all was fixed and the order was processed .
2	cannot recommend them highly_enough .
2	thank_you wowcher
2	ordered saturday , free delivery on monday with a four hour_window advised before 0am as advertised .
2	delivery guys very helpful and went beyond the call to get the large fridge_freezer in to the kitchen .
2	well_chuffed !
2	found it quite difficult to initially navigate the site to set it up but so pleased that i persevered !!
2	the end_result was really worth it and am dead_chuffed with it !
2	00 / 00 . excellent service from both tyre_shopper and national_tyres fitting service .

2	derrick
2	i have used i florist a number of times now and have never had a problem with service and quality .
2	will use again .
2	derrick
2	these_guys are selective scammers !
2	if you place an order with price matching or order any products where there advertised price is the lowest , they put low priority on shipping your order .
2	it took them 0 days to ship this last order .... 00 days til delivery .
2	and they offer free items ...... i never received my free_shaker_cup that i ordered .
2	bad business !
2	don_'_t trust them ....
2	when my chair arrived , i was initially puzzled as to the lack of instructions .
2	i checked the office_furniture website and discovered a brilliant video on how to build the chair .
2	this so much_better_than the usual , badly translated instruction_sheet which is the norm from other_suppliers .
2	within a couple of minutes i was an expert at building chairs .
2	the chair is very comfortable and looks good in my home office .
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending the whisky_exchange .
2	the secure transaction was easy to complete .
2	the bottles were sent promptly and in well_packed boxes , with tracking .
2	their service works !
2	be patient as the turnaround time for the unlocking service varies but you will get satisfaction .
2	my phone did not activate at first but they responded on how to fix the problem on my end .
2	they had already unlocked my phone .
2	now it works great !
2	probably te best people to buy a juicer from in uk , they stock the best and are very fasy on delivery .
2	recommended .
2	i needed to obtain a small vox mini 0 amp this week for a gig i had to do with it on saturday .
2	i placed an order late wednesday , and it arrived thursday !!!
2	totally amazed by their speed of response , and fair prices .
2	i will be back to buy again from these_guys .
2	why are all suppliers not like this .
2	brilliant company to deal with .
2	thanks again .
2	i called and asked for the best offer available that day to replace my colour_laser_printer .
2	i was offered the lexmark 000 at half the normal price which was less costly than replacing a set of toners for my existing printer .
2	the printer was needed in a hurry and i was told stocks were arriving that afternoon and that it would be shipped immediately and would have full 0k page toners and delivery was free .
2	it was indeed delivered before_midday on the following_day !
2	the person_who told me about the product didn_'_t mention that this printer had duplex functionality so that was a very pleasant_surprise and is saving me a lot in printing costs already .
2	i have used printerland before and been impressed with the prices and service .
2	this experience was better_than ever - simply the best !
2	it '_s the first order i have place with yourselves and can '_t believe
2	how quickly i received my order , within 00 hour , fab .
2	possibly a bit of a hard_sell on accessories when i called to check the status , but a very good deal from zac .
2	i thoroughly_recommend them without_reservation
2	absolutely_delighted with the service from this organisation .
2	ordered my ticket for an executive seat in the block next to the stage at the 00 arena for 00th_december .
2	got an email and telephone confirmation of the order .
2	i did telephone them prior to getting these confirmations as i had heard some " bad " press , but i need not have worried as i have now received my ticket and i certainly would use them again .
2	i moved to o0 what a mistake , thats all i will say
2	ordered 0 front mats for my tt with black and silver edge trim to match car interior .
2	i also selected the pvc heel guard and the mats look good and fit the audi mat clips perfectly - wish i had bothered to do this ages_ago after the audi drivers_mat wore through at the heel position .
2	good website , great choice of tyres , great prices and quality tyre_fitting_centres .
2	simple to navigate website and quite intuitive to work through .
2	simple navigation ( and helpful reminders in case you miss something !
2	).
2	unfortunately i couldn_'_t get my purchase to work on my ipad so had to reprocess it on my pc ( due to the online help being offline ...).
2	after_reading positive_reviews , i decided to give travelpharm a try & paid £_00 for a joint prescription , with my wife for : atovaquone and proguanil 000mg / 000mg single tablet ( equivalent to malarone_tablets ).
2	i was very pleased with the easy to use website & the first_class service provided .
2	i will_definately_use them again & heartily_recommend them to others !
2	east to use website , with a smiley_face if your photos are good & a sad face if the image is no good , makes for perfect results .
2	the finished items are better_than i expected & the turn_around from order to delivery was very quick , indeed .
2	i ordered a table from achica , order no .
2	:_000000 , in november and was informed that delivery would be between the 0th - 0th_december .
2	as i was away on these dates i asked if it could be delivered to my neighbours house or put on hold , i was informed that it would be put on hold and that i should contact them again for delivery .
2	this i did and i was informed that the item was authorised for despatch .,
2	as i did not receive the table i emailed achica again only to be told that the table was out of stock and would not be available until sometime in 0000 .
2	when i queried exactly when this would be , i was told that a refund had been made .
2	i replied that i did not want a refund and followed this up with a letter to head_office , asking them to implement their complaints_procedure , and that they were in breach of contract .
2	this was received by them on 00 / 00 /_0000 .
2	i have not received a reply to my letter nor have i received a refund .
2	the business model that achica seems to have is wanting !
2	very good service completed in less_than 00_hours ,
2	thank_you
2	good product . very good postage and packing , many_thanks barry ,
2	great company good info very helpfulcame next_day , many_thanks . b grocott
2	recommended by a friend .
2	bought a nilfisk pressure_washer at cleanstore online .
2	price was by far the best i could_find .
2	site is easy to use , received the goods promptly and without_fuss , very pleased with the whole service - and the product !
2	would recommend to anyone .
2	website , email and telephone all used and all very clear and helpful .
2	the personal communications were prompt and friendly .
2	the garage used was great - quick and professional .
2	the whole_process was simple and easy , no_hassle and a pleasure to use .
2	will use blackcircles . com again and am very happy to recommend to others .
2	i '_m pleased the products are made in the uk - i feel i can trust the quality .
2	i have found the larger tablets easier to swallow than the equivalent from another top manufacturer .
2	and the price is good !
2	service also excellent , when ordering both by telephone and online .
2	very happy to recommend to others .
2	bought a tilt and swing tv bracket , arrived next_day , top quality bracket fitted_perfectly and just couldn_'_t beat the price anywhere .
2	recommended .
2	spot on .
2	thank_you .
2	i was told about shiply and thought i would give it a go .
2	it was taking me ages asking around and phoning for quotes .
2	doing all the legwork myself .
2	i received a couple of high quotes , as you do , but then the prices started to come down to around the same as the other quotes i had beforehand
2	in the end i got a quote at the price i wanted to pay and went with it .
2	the driver and his vehicle were absolutely perfect for my cargo and he definitely knew what he was doing .
2	if you want anything moving then try shiply first .
2	i '_m glad that i did
2	i am new to aircooled , but my bro - in - law isn_'_t and has a type 0b bay camper after a stream of type 0 '_s .
2	i have bought a 0000 0000 , which needs a little tlc in the usual places , having swotted up on the beetles .
2	inner wings and parts of the heater channels .....
2	my ' bro ' recommended that i use jk as they had a great website , but they also did free_postage over £_00 order value , which he said was a ' no_brainer '.
2	i looked around being the penny conscious person i am and found slightly_cheaper bits on other_companies websites , but is was marginal being honest .
2	they didn_'_t offer free_postage and when added to the order , then they worked out more money , so his advice was 000_% accurate .
2	i placed my first order only last_week and it was the easiest thing to do due to the website being sooooooo ' newbee ' friendly .
2	the information on tracking the order was so professional and first_class .
2	the delivery was rapid and when the items arrived i was very impressed with the packaging .
2	these_guys are not scared to wrap things up in lots of protection .
2	i was well impressed and will always use jk first .
2	in not always from now on .
2	i will make a point of telling them personally when i see then at malvern for busfest 0000 .
2	assuming they are there .
2	awesome and thanks
2	bulk_powders really are a great sports_nutrition and supplement_provider .
2	i have always found their information clear , concise and helpful .
2	i '_ve been using supplements and dietary aids for a few_months now and with a healthy_eating plan and gym work i have transformed myself .
2	i didn_'_t think at an age closer to 00 than i like i would be able to get back in shape , but i have .
2	i feel so much more alive and confident as a result .
2	i have had no weird reactions to any of the products i have used and any sensations i may have felt are as a result of expecting them anyway .
2	such is the level of information given .
2	i still_haven_'_t achieved my target , but i definitely don_'_t mind taking my top off now or going swimming with my young son .
2	i '_ve taken it steady , but i am absolutely convinced that the advice given to help me chose the right supplements for what i want to achieve has made a huge_difference .
2	all the parcels arrived next_day .
2	what a great friendly service .
2	had a great chat with izabella on the phones , these_people have their fingers on the pulse .
2	i will use this service again without_any doubt .
2	collected when promised delivered in record time .
2	astounding .
2	purchased a case of beers i have enjoyed on trips to germany , arrived promptly in time for the christmas festivities .
2	more choice of other dark beers please , the kostritzer schwarzbier was fantastic
2	had to return an amazon parcel and had heard bad_reports but thought okay lets_see .
2	the first time they never turned_up and no follow_up to say sorry we didn_'_t collect .
2	it is all down to you to rearrange and they do not even respond to the content of your emails .
2	when i asked for a customer_services manager contact they just ignored that part of the email and took notice of my rearrangement request .
2	they then didn_'_t turn_up for that collection either and i have not had any response to my further complaint as i right .
2	needless to say amazon rectified things almost_immediately , arranging for a proper company to collect the parcel .
2	you know sometimes you just want to swear and curse ?
2	that is why you wont see a contact number on their website .
2	clueless
2	ordered drill & accessories at weekend with free tracked delivery & received it all tuesday a . m . price was the cheapest on the internet and , just for good measure , there was a " manager '_s special " of a free pair of knee_pads .
2	exceptionally superb seller .
2	ordered a watch half the price elsewhere and rec ' d it within a couple of days for just £ 0 delivery & accompanied_by 00_%_off next purchase .
2	easily & cheaply contactable if necessary with just wonderful service .
2	would highly_recommend marketcross jewellers to others .
2	ordered 0 mattresses on 0th , & delivered 0th .
2	to receive them rolled_up would '_ve been a surprise had other_reviewers not warned us but products absolutely fine .
2	will_certainly recommend furniture 000 and use again .
2	due to my confusion in placing my order on line tues phoned weds & despite less_than straightforward requirements ( different_coloured extra keys but alike ) received order friday_lunchtime and fitted within the hour so secure for our weekend_break .
2	just extraordinarily good service .
2	super quality reclining garden chairs with glass topped table , parasol & base £_000 ( 00_%) cheaper_than local garden_centre , delivered to our rear_garden without charge .
2	just tremendous .
2	only_disappointment was waiting over a week instead of " standard 0 - 0 day delivery " but , hey - the weather '_s still good !
2	absolutely_brilliant service .
2	good price , even with postage , and arrived faster_than federer '_s serve !!
2	couldn_'_t be more pleased .... unless they gave them away !
2	ordered branded blades friday and delivered early saturday .
2	astonishingly good service at a price 00_% below others that i contemplated using .
2	i '_ll certainly use ffx again .
2	always competitively_priced , tyres can be ordered so easily and fitted close to home usually while you wait .
2	excellent service .
2	i am already a regular customer of flightstore and enjoy their internet experience !
2	fast and easy !
2	today i had cause to phone them for some advice .
2	really very helpfull !
2	thanks again !
2	technician tony_allen came to my house to fit two nexen tyres on the front of my fiancee '_s volvo c00 .
2	he was very friendly ( cup of coffee always helps to break the ice ).
2	he gave_me very good advice in respect of the wheel_nuts which were swelling and he also gave_me good advice in respect of the future pressure on my fiancees front tyres .
2	i could not beleive_how quick he was and the whole_process was really painless .
2	would have no_hesitation of using tyres on the drive again .
2	great value , exactly_what we need , quality products , friendly service , fast delivery ... they tick all the boxes
2	i have never used this company and while_searching for a fridge - freezer up they came with the best price by a long way , i went_ahead and was a bit_worried , as i had never_heard of the company .
2	no need to worry , the item came spot on the date as promised , a phone_call 0 hour before just to let you know they were nearly there .
2	the delivery man was very good , before you could go forward to help he had it in the house and position where i wanted it .
2	he gave_me a couple of hints as to what to do , before i plugged the machine in and once i was happy off he went .
2	i did not ask for the package where the appliance is stripped of the packaging , as i am reasonable fit , for my age .
2	i had no problem in removing all the packaging and levelling the appliance .
2	it is now running away and i am very happy .
2	thank_you beyond_television , i will_definitely recommend you .
2	i run a wild hedgehog rescue and was completely full , needing two indoor guinea pig hutches superquick .
2	i paid the extra £ 0 . 00 for guaranteed superfast delivery and had the items delivered by courier less_than 00_hours after i ' d placed my order .
2	great work , viovet !
2	an excellent service .
2	good communications and they only take your money after they have made the copy ( ie they know there are no_problems ) and are about to send it back .
2	it came back as a high_quality dvd in a box with the original video .
2	postage to them is free .
2	so an excellent service which i would use again and highly_recommend .
2	good products , good comms , fast service , nice people , no_quibble_returns .
2	( i ordered something by mistake ) i have used this company before and i can '_t really see what more anyone could want !
2	i bought a krups kp000000 nescafe dolce_gusto melody 0 coffee_machine from them , and it was faulty on first use , i rang them and they informed me that i had to email my complaint as they dont deal with problems over the phone , so i emailled all the details and after 0 days there was no response so i rang again and again they would not put me through to customers services , they said they would speak to the relevant_department and get them to contact me by phone asap , 00_hrs later i got an email giving me a number to contact dolce_gusto direct ,
2	they sell you product then wash their hands of you
2	order no 000000000
2	effective communication , quick response .
2	fast delivery .
2	quality products
2	the goods arrived very well_packed and really quickly cant give a rating for the good as not yet used them
2	i didn_'_t want very much .
2	the cutlery holder in my dishwasher had holes in after much use so i bought one .
2	it was very simple and the goods arrived quickly and were of a good quality .
2	i had the misfortune to allow the lid on an antique chest to open unsupported , and the cast_iron hinges snapped .
2	searched the internet for replacements and found the exact item from ironmongery_direct .
2	delivery was prompt .
2	hinges now fitted and you wouldn_'_t know they were not original .
2	outlined the type of music i listen too , and that the headphones should be closed back .
2	received recommendations which enabled_me to decide on a suitable set .
2	despatch very timely and received next_day .
2	this is a great album , but i knew that already .
2	it was delivered promptly and packaged very well .
2	buy without_hesitation from this seller .
2	i had a parcel posted to me , unfortunately as i was away for 0 days ( fri - monday ) i was advised my parcel had been returned to sender !
2	initially i phoned the number on the card and given an address to collect the parcel , i drove to the address given ( arriving 00_minutes later ) only to be told that my parcel was in the van being returned to sender !
2	called customer_services premium_rate number .
2	to be told that they have depot where parcel will be returned to , but customers cannot collect from there , so basically because i was away for a weekend i lose my parcel .
2	no customer service at all .
2	i received £_000 sainsbury '_s gift_card and as i dont have a local sainsburys store decided to put the gift_card towards the purchase of an ipad .
2	i went online and found they were available however i then found that sainbury '_s online would not accept sainsbury '_s own gift_card !!
2	i went online and checked if my nearest_store woud have an ipad and was assured that they did sell them .
2	so off i went making a journey to the store .
2	when i arrived i was told the store didnt sell ipads and was given a number to call .
2	i called the number and basically found myself at a very unhelpful customer_services staff who basically said i could travel to great yarmouth ( over 000_miles round_trip ) or ely ( 00 miles round_trip ) to buy an ipad .
2	i asked if i could have one sent to peterborough store and was told no .
2	i asked when would peterborough receive stock ?
2	i was told no idea and it was doubtful as they had difficulty obtaining stocks !
2	this dispite sainsburys online having plenty in stock !!
2	and all other local retailers not having stock issues !
2	well sainsbury '_s this is just not good enough for what is supposed to be a major_retailer .
2	customer_services is appalling , service is appalling and what is the point of having gift cards that cannot be accepted by your online store !
2	no wonder competitors are moving ahead if customers are being prevented from making purchases !
2	i tell you what , don_'_t go_anywhere_else for your_pets health products , they knocked £_00 of my other best price .
2	thanks a lot !
2	hello indigo_herbs , thanks for the quicker_than_expected delivery time , i ordered the products 0 days before_christmas_eve and they arrived on the 0rd day after ordering .
2	thanks , i will be ordering again
2	you cannot find a better service , from ease of finding the required product both selecting and paying so simple and the delivery time superb received my goods within_0days of ordering excellent packaging to protect the product in my case a ornamental dog the whole shopping_experience was hassle_free unlike_some web sites the only thing i was amazed at was how i had not heard of this company before it was a delight to purchase from them and i certainly will again and no this is not written by an employee of the company .. just a very satisfied customer .
2	the fencing i ordered was of excellent quality and of a very good price for both the panels and posts my total_satisfaction was however spoiled by the non delivery of 0 fence posts which i had to purchase locally . however this will not stop me recommending waltons to anyone . delivery was on time and the delivery man was helpful and polite and could not apologize enough for the error on the delivery .
2	i purchase often online around the planet but first time with forzieri .
2	keen to get your sale .
2	i purchased a suede men '_s jacket & was duly told of a 0 week backorder .
2	i emailed twice but received no reply .
2	then 0_weeks_later received a shipped email with dhl .
2	0 days_later it arrived , beautify packaged .
2	and it is a quality garment superbly made , fits 000_%, is quality material & looks the part .
2	i would like to give 0_stars but can only give 0 ...
2	these days it has never been easier to communicate with anyone around the globe so there is absolutely no excuse for not replying to my email .
2	i will buy again but check on stock prior to pushing the buy button .... if possible to get such an answer ...!
2	just a quick thank_you email to say how happy i ’_m with the new jumper which arrived on monday .
2	both my wife & myself have purchased many items from country_attire as we are both big barbour devotees .
2	it is absolutely amazing & given we live in a remote rural_location , it is far easier to purchase online in the uk , than locally in victoria , australia .
2	we gain a superior product , quickly & securely at a vastly_reduced cost ….
2	a real win - win_situation !
2	all the best to you …. and keep_up the high_quality standard – you will flourish !
2	cheers , matthew & pauline b
2	recommended by a friend , tried it , everything i needed in one place , very good prices , happy to use again .
2	i have used shipley a couple of times now and have had no_problems what so ever .
2	it '_s been very easy to use the site and the response you get is great .
2	not enough words , just appalling , rude and then they just cut you off on their phone system .
2	i now hate their tune , rainbows gives me nightmares now .
2	just awful .
2	maving all my mobiles etc . away , happy to pay a premium to stop them being part of my life .
2	if you read this and still sign up , you have been_warned ...
2	because i live in the highlands of scotland when a company tells_me you will have it tomorrow i automatically think yea like that '_s going to happen , it never has before
2	that is until now , i ordered late monday_night got an e_- mail tuesday_morning saying i would have it wednesday and low and behold it arrived by lunch time wednesday .
2	i have no_reservations in recommending this company and will_definitely use them again ,
2	i should mention that i did not ask for or indeed pay for overnight delivery , and that the e_- mail advice before i purchased was exceptional , and of course the price was the best i could_find on the net .

2	i went to double0tickets . com and ordered a ' single ' ticket twice !
2	for £_00 each ( face value of £_00 each ) .... okay the seats aren_'_t next to each other , but we ' re in the same block ( block 00 lg arena b ' ham ) near the stage to see rod_stewart .
2	.... and they arrived within_00hrs ( signed for post ) ................ try double0 for tickets !
2	booked an oil_change and filter service online , paid online and the work was done within an_hour whilst i walked my dog !
2	.... good service , no delays .

2	sold my nexus_0 tablet as fonebank offered the best price . sent it special delivery on a wednesday and received my cheque for the full_amount on the friday , that '_s two_days . perfect service and highly_reccomended , can '_t say more than that ..
2	order arrived on time and with a bit extra . for no extra_cost , my order was packaged in presentation_boxes , a really nice suprise . would order again without_hesitation ..
2	the other morning i awoke to find 000 reg had took £_00 for hosting for a domain i dont own .
2	it was taken out of my paypal_account , i put a 000 reg ticket in to complain .
2	i also rung paypal and they said open up a case , which i did
2	a few hours_later paypal give me my money back and i thought that it was a mistake by 000 reg and that was it .
2	today i couldn_'_t log on to my account with 000reg when i phoned them they said because i went through paypal and got my money back i have also given 000 reg bad feedback with paypal so they want the money and a 00 . 00 admin_fee £_00 in total before they reopen the account .
2	****** update :******
2	i have changed my rating to 0_stars , and they deserve it , i have the most helpful people from 000 reg ring me and sort all this out .
2	i received a call from customer_services , who then passed me to the hosting team , who sorted my problem then passed me to domains to sort another issue .
2	problem ... what problem , really happy with the service and the way this has_been handled
2	i would recommend these_guys anytime .

2	goods ordered about 0 pm and arrived by 0 pm the next_day excellent service and also excellent advise on the phone when i wanted a few answers before ordering .. well_done wheelspin
2	we ' re first time travellers birmingham - london - paris - zurich - very clear steps , important transfer timings included , easy to use website
2	bought a kettle and toaster - very quick delivery , well_packed , very pleased with the quality and performance of the products .
2	was able to track the ups delivery all the way .
2	highly_recommended company with after sales service which is just pure excellence !
2	thanks andy ...
2	viewed this dog lead on ebay .
2	it was excellent quality , great value and very speedy delivery .
2	highly_recommended .
2	i had waited 0_weeks from amazon for this mattress only to be informed it would be at_least another 00 days .
2	cancelled and ordered with mattressnextday . co . uk with a little_trepidation .
2	need not have worried one little_bit .
2	delivery , ( to belfast ) took just two_days and the communication was first_class .
2	really , really impressed with this transaction and will look no further for the next purchase .
2	the price was excellent as well .
2	dealing_with plumbtraders was easy & efficient .
2	after sales advice was excellent and prompt .
2	why go_anywhere_else ?
2	i first approached cps for advice about a ups for a new home office set - up in france and received very helpful advice .
2	i placed my order on the basis of the prompt and helpful responses and the excellent vfm .
2	& months later i had an unexpected failure of one of the ups and i contacted jason who not only agreed to replace the unit immediately but because i was only in uk for a short_period actually delivered the replacement ( a much higher_spec unit ) to me at home the following evening .
2	beat that for service and support if you can !
2	needless to say i will not bother to look_elsewhere for any future ups requirements .
2	my purchase from appliancesdirect . co . uk was a complete and utter nightmare .
2	i purchased a washer_dryer together with installation by their specialist fitters , the total coming to nearly_£ 0000 .
2	first complaint – the machine was supposed to be in stock , according to their website .
2	it took 0_weeks to come .
2	second complaint – the so - called professional fitters sucked .
2	they were nothing more than delivery boys and had no clue how to install it .
2	they left having damaged the machine and not installing it .
2	their fee was £_000 . 00 .
2	third complaint – dealing_with appliancesdirect after care service also sucked .
2	they claimed that the installation was too difficult and therefore they couldn ’_t do it .
2	they still kept the £_000 . 00 .
2	i have asked for a refund of the installation fee but they have refused .
2	0_weeks have passed and i cannot use the machine and appliancesdirect are ignoring my concerns .
2	their complaints_procedure is non - existent .
2	appliancesdirect service is poor ; they have swindled me out of nearly_£ 0000 for a machine i cannot use .
2	i have considered legal_action .
2	today a professional fitter has had a look .
2	he will be able to repair what appliancesdirect fitters broke , but i will have to pay a second fitting fee .
2	should ’ ve gone to john_lewis .
2	00 / 0 / 00 replied to brittany '_s post , and guess_what ?
2	nothing !
2	they don_'_t give a dam , they ' re just interested in taking your money and if there are problems it '_s the middle finger to you .
2	if you don_'_t mind ordering from_hong_kong then this is your website .
2	surprisingly fast delivery and cheap prices .
2	i love this shop .
2	been using it for a number of years .
2	good website , good selection of goods and super service .
2	bought a canon_0d 0 years_ago , had problems with it but it was sorted very quickly .
2	top_marks
2	used them several_times and have always been happy .
2	very competitive_prices and good , fast delivery .
2	been using amazon for years .
2	very reliable delivery , most things come quickly and well_packaged , therefore undamaged .
2	money is refunded without_quibble should any_problems arise .
2	finally , after about one month of waiting i managed thanks to the professionalism of the staff from official_iphone_unlock . uk have to unlock my iphone_0s .
2	to those who are still_waiting for the breakouts just say be patient because this is a serious company and will_certainly bring out all the necessary operations .
2	thanks so much to all operators officia iphone_unlock by francis - rome italy
2	i have been using this company for a few_years_now and always had complete_satisfaction .
2	the website is easy to use and i have always received a good deal .
2	i have had a few small questions but an email or phone_call to friendly member of staff and things have been quickly answered .
2	fraser arrived on time ( despite the friday - before - christmas_rush - hour traffic ) to change three tyres .
2	he changed two quickly and efficiently .
2	there was a problem removing the locking_nut to the third , probably because of damage_caused_by a garage mechanic working on a wheel_bearing earlier in the week .
2	however , fraser knew his stuff and told me the what i needed to do by way of getting the locking removed .
2	he was a nice guy , courteous , efficient and knowledgeable .
2	top_marks .
2	you should try this company before others , i did and was well pleased .
2	don_'_t think about it !
2	just do it and join , i did , and ah ho !
2	i won !!!!!!!!!
2	!
2	excellent very fast and reliable service would totally recommend
2	ordered a couple of items late wednesday_evening , delivered to my office on friday_morning .
2	items fitted to my camper_van later that day .
2	will_definitely buy from just_kampers again .
2	just a few_clicks on - line and you have selected the tyres that you need ( from a great choice ), booked the fitting at a local_garage / tyre_fitter and paid a great price for your tyres .
2	then just turn_up to have them fitted .
2	simples .
2	after being sold a stolen note 0 on ebay , i found handtec and can '_t speak highly_enough about order process ., delivery and product that worked straight out of the box .
2	ordered just after 0pm and just 00_hours_later the note 0 was in my hand having been delivered by one the best courier services , dpd .
2	the whole_process is one i would am very happy to recommend ... as i said " absolutely first_class "
2	absolutely first_class sevice , order placed on line thursday_evening 00 / 00 /_0000 one id check phone_call and the tv was delivered this morning .
2	i very happy to recomend electrical 000 and i will always check them before i make any future_purchases .
2	i hated scooping the cat_litter , so i bought the omega paw self cleaning litter box , this was the cheapest i could_find it , along with some worlds best original cat_litter .
2	both work together really well my cat took to them right away .
2	items were shipped the next_day and arrived a couple of days_later .
2	no_problems or issues at all .
2	i contacted many properties with sunny rentals .
2	some replied , some didn_'_t .
2	their reply was quick and accurate but many replied in their own language which i found hard to communicate with .
2	overall i would try them again if i was looking to rent again .
2	nice product that fits my car .
2	arrived quickly and a fair price
2	easy to select the tyres online . arrived at 0 . 00 seen straight_away .
2	offered tracking realignment at an extra_cost of £_00 . 00 and decided to accept .
2	all done and away by 0 . 00 .
2	staff were helpful and friendly .
2	i order lots of packets online , always arrive on time , cannot ask for more , great service .
2	ordered my fish_tank , through their website , kept up to date on when it would arrive .
2	arkpets own driver phoned ahead with a warning of his arrival and carried the heavy tank in for me .
2	great service and a super price , will use again and again .
2	prices may be a bit higher_than other internet shops but when the service is this good it is worth_paying a little_bit extra .
2	a simple internet booking and paying procedure , followed_by a telephone_call from a kwikfit representative to confirm .
2	then a call from another rep to confirm day of fitting .
2	then fitter came and fitted our tyres .
2	fitter was very polite and a credit to kwikfit ( wrexham branch ).
2	a fantastic service with great value .
2	could not recommend more highly and will_definitely use the service again .
2	i had arranged a collection with the wrong couriers as i need one that did not require a label printing .
2	i contacted the on - line help_desk .
2	i was connected to emily who very quickly re arranged my collection with a courier who did not need a label .
2	emily made the process very easy and my problem was sorted_out quickly .
2	i would rate the help_desk service very highly .
2	if you have a problem don_'_t be afraid to use this service .
2	i originally got connected to leanne who also provided quick help but before she could completed helping_me i cut my self off the chat .
2	i then re opened the chat and got emily who was able to pick straight up from where leanne had been cut_off
2	thanks leanne
2	thanks emily

2	we started_using printerland around00 months_ago , on the recommendation of a business contact .
2	since then we have purchased a number of printers and consumables from them and have been hugely_impressed by the quality & speed of service .
2	friendly & well informed staff who are always able to provide information on cost_effective solutions for our business and next_day delivery make printerland a key supplier to our business and we have no_hesitation in recommending them to any of our business partners & clients .

2	the ordering was very easy with very clear_instructions on how to measure your size . the follow_up information was quick and traking my order all the way was made easy . overall i was very pleased with the product & fit & the price was perfect
2	i was impressed with the small vanity_unit i ordered , very good quality & at a very good price .
2	highly_recommended .
2	good website , very easy to use .
2	i ordered a shower_panel kit & was surprised at how strong the panels are , they should last well .
2	i would strongly_recommend this company to family & friends .
2	i give 0_stars to blackcircles . com & i also give 0_stars to basingstoke mot & tyre_centre for their friendly & efficient service .
2	i would certainly recommend to family / friends & will_certainly use again .
2	i went to choose a digital_piano and was given expert help and advice .
2	ordering was simple and the staff gave_me an accurate time - scale as to when i could expect delivery .
2	i was informed by email and phone_call of the delivery date and time so that someone could be in to receive the instrument .
2	the delivery staff placed the instrument where i wanted it , unpacked and checked it was working well and cleared all the packing as they left .
2	i could not ask for more .
2	i have had cause to use shower_doctor 0 times and on each_occasion the item was easy to find - order and deispatched as promised - kept_informed and recieved on time well_packaged and correct would definately_reccomend to anyone
2	i would like to compliment the products and the service offered in our recent_purchase of several bedroom_furniture items .
2	from the ease of the web_site in selecting the prodcuts thier very competitive_prices and the help from the sales_team in answering_queries and helping arrange the delivery first_class service . at the last_minute the delivery had to be changed to so that the goods had to be put into my gargage with no one in attendance this was carried_out with the upmost care and professionalism and it has_been a great buying experince .
2	i would reccomend oak_furnitureland and will be using them again in the future .

2	i have ordered electronic_components ( switches , tools , semiconductors ...) from rapid electronics ' huge_range for years .
2	they invariably send the correct items and are unbelievably_fast - next_day is the norm for them .
2	the components are well priced but not the junk quality which seems to be invading the uk at present .
2	very professional and a joy to deal with .
2	i ordered some rechargeable cells .
2	i received a confirmation_email from " paypoint . net " but no further communication .
2	after a fortnight , i tried their phone numbers several_times - one is always engaged ; the other is never answered .
2	i emailed , asking if there had been some problem with my order .
2	00 days_later there is still no word from them .
2	no money has_been taken from my credit_card yet - in the meantime it has expired , so they probably will not be able to if they decide to wake_up now .
2	in a time of recession , one hopes that companies with good customer service will struggle through - the others will fall by the wayside .
2	batteriesplus come into the latter category .
2	what a shame .
2	i ordered 0 continental winter_tyres on steel rims for my vw_golf 0 .
2	they arrived from hamburg in perfect_condition ( wrapped in clear plastic ) within a couple of days .
2	balanced , inflated to 0 . 0bar and even mounted as required for the front_wheels ( direction of rotation is marked on the tyres ; one was mounted for the left side and the other for the right ).
2	i was pleased that the original vw plastic " spokey " trims fitted .
2	now i '_m puzzled that these tyres are actually quieter_than the michelin summer tyres ..........
2	it '_s a strange thing to buy tyres while sitting at a pc in scotland and have them delivered - for less_than i could buy rims and tyres locally ( within 00 miles ).
2	no greasy workshop monkey with a razor_sharp jack ripping the paint off the underside of our car this time !
2	i fully_intend to use these_people again .
2	our 00 year_old old fridge died and appliances_online were able to send us a new one in 0 days .
2	they kept us informed of progress and delivered exactly when they said they would .
2	very impressed .
2	very fast next_day delivery instructions very informative as well i would highly_recommend mr_memory
2	as i live close to the hatchbag factory i was able to visit to view the product in situ as well as see the various colours available .
2	ralph and the team couldn_'_t have been more helpful , explaining my options in terms of extras i might require - went for the tailgate flap and the back of seat protector and am really glad i did .
2	i have now had my hatchbag for over a week and it has made such a difference to my car . it fits_perfectly i went for the grey colour to go with my silver car with black interior and it is exactly right . i also recommend the comfy dog bedding they offer ..
2	i ordered the goods and they were delivered within 00 hourse .
2	that is great service - thank_you .
2	ordered coat lunchtime yesterday and it arrived first thing this morning .
2	it was a gift for my mum and gratefully_received just before the snow comes .
2	thank_you gear_zone - what amazing service !
2	and it was the best price i ' d seen for the coat too !
2	i wanted some vitamins , got online , ordered and came in very swiftly !
2	thank_you !
2	when it comes to physical items that are sent by mail , paypal continues to be my first service .
2	when it is about virtual items ( in game items etc .
2	), paypal seems to regret to support a dispute .
2	this means the seller can easily get away with my money , without delivering anything and with paypal not able to take any meaningful action .
2	i have been purchasing vitamins online for years and multivits . co . uk have been providing the best service ever no matter the distance .
2	if one adds to this , the top quality products they have , there is no reason to look_elsewhere in europe .
2	great company , great products , great service !
2	0star service from age_partnership .
2	all necessary_paperwork completed with no_problems and a better annuity than my pension_provider offered .
2	special thanks to omar_mesbahi , a true professional .

2	this was a perfect transaction .
2	no issues
2	i have ordered much over the years and will again , but i am miffed that i ordered a guitar for next_day delivery , and then tracked the order to find it will arrive in two_weeks .
2	i have had other issues with late or never arriving gibson guitars .
2	i always parcel0go to send all my parcels .
2	they are 000_% reliable and never_let you down .
2	their prices are very competitive too .
2	i had a problem with sending a parcel recently when i was using their website , but they have an excellent " live_chat " feature which i used and daniel talked_me through my problem and sorted it in a few minutes
2	the website was easy to navigate and finding exactly_what you wanted was easy .
2	delivery service was efficient , goods where well_packed and quality of furniture was very good .
2	purchased this item as a gift so can '_t give an opinion about product
2	item was delivered on time and was in condition described on website .
2	however i thought i had purchased a zepplin air as the unit was an ex - display item and i thought that was the reason it was considerably_less_than a brand_new unit .
2	i did check the website and realised i had made a mistake .
2	i would advise anybody buying one these units to check carefully which one they are ordering .
2	having said that , this is an excellent unit with great sound quality , the only real flaw being the remote .
2	having paid £_000 less for this unit than the new air model , i don_'_t think being_able to stream music from your computer or ipod is worth the extra money , as it '_s not really a big deal using it as a docking_station which is basically what it was designed to be .
2	i would have no hesitaion in recommending this service .
2	prompt collection at drop_off point right outside the terminal .
2	only a few minutes to wait upon our return at 0am !
2	!
2	can '_t beat it for the money .
2	i almost invariably use wex for my photographic purchases ( the odd specialised item they don_'_t stock ).
2	i have always found them competitively_priced and their delivery service is superb
2	unbelievable fast turn - round for a 00 page a0 booklet courier delivered in just on 00_hours will_certainly use again .
2	i order clarins shower_gel from them regularly and it turns_up usually next_day .
2	can '_t fault the service , good prices and well_packed product .
2	00 / 00
2	gordon
2	bought ipod_nano delivered next_day at stated time , would recommend can '_t fault them , and if were to have a problem hopefully the customer service would be just as good .
2	thanks again
2	items were delivered promptly and as ordered .
2	excellent supplier , excellent price and cashback from topcashback as well .
2	ordering was easy , good website .
2	delivery was prompt .
2	excellent service .
2	i would recommend this company .
2	i was unsure what i wanted , so emailed a question and got a quick reply .
2	the price was the cheapest and delivery was fast too !
2	needing an earth leakage clamp meter recently , i got the best price from test - meter , plus someone knowledgeable and helpful to talk to , and prompt dispatch once i ' d ordered .
2	i '_ve_used them before several_times , and definitely expect to use them again .
2	i really like the delivery service , notification of a timed 0hr delivery slot , and being_able to reschedule it online really easily .
2	if your looking for a good ferry deal , then the guys to look at for getting you the best price are a ferry
2	i booked a car through these with goldcar from barcelona and couldn_'_t believe that it was € 00 for the week .
2	i read the small_print and found an extra € 00 charge for driving it to andorra .
2	okay still cheap at €_000 but after a two hour wait to be served and by the time i left the place it had risen to an amazing €_000 . 00 .
2	this came from a hidden option to take out their insurance at €_000 plus ( or be forced to hand over a €_000 deposit )
2	and then a full_tank of fuel at € 0 . 00 per_litre .
2	surely the most expensive fuel in the whole of spain .
2	having used them many_times before , i will never ever use them again .
2	and if you contact them to ask why , they just won_'_t reply , so don_'_t bother trying .
2	johnny lyle is actually my hero .
2	he is wise , bold and strong and slays dragons in his spare time .
2	i cannot recommend him highly_enough .
2	such a lot to be earned for minimal_fuss to ease the burden of essential purchases and services , helps keep the budget intact !
2	besides competitive_prices ( compared with 0 other_sites ), the page was so easy to navigate and understand , even down to a local_fitter , time and place to suit me .
2	thoroughly_recommended !
2	and post it , phew exausted now , you ' d think mazuma would find a way of doing that for me ...... they do everything else !
2	i had a great experience when shopping at buy - spares .
2	i also had great service and the item arrived well_packed and very quickly .
2	i had an excellent experience when dealing_with model_railway loft .
2	smooth_transaction and excellent item purchased .
2	thanks so much .
2	this was the first time i have used openeo and every part of the experience was superb .
2	not that i do a lot of miles but i will use them again .
2	thank_you very much
2	very prompt and reliable service .
2	what i wanted delivered quickly
2	ordered mugs on 0rd no mugs by the 0th .
2	phoned and was told someone would get back to me .
2	two hours_later no one phoned i phoned again to be told " we are waiting on the warehouse so i have nothing to tell you " where is the warehouse china no cant be i have had items delivered quicker from america .
2	will never use or recomend them .
2	facebook a good place to start !!!!!
2	have just had a phone_call from the sales_manager who i have to say was the total_opposite very polite and offered a full_refund plus free mugs so for this reason i will make it 0_stars and when all goes through will make more stars .
2	i asked them via_email to specify advanced search ( whey_protein with stevia ) and got a prompt response with direct link to products .
2	used hpi a few_times now before purchasing a car and have always considered them to be the market_leaders and trust their data therefore i would never consider purchasing a car without a check .
2	looking at the other alternatives and although i have not tried them yet i consider the charge for hpi and the data you get is competetive and good value when you balance that against the risk of the money you are about to pay for a car .
2	do not buy a car without a check either by yourself or get the dealer to provide .
2	this company provided a first_class friendly and helpful service and i am more than willing to recommend them to friends and colleagues .

2	i have only used this company once , but i will_defiantly be using them again , easy to use internet order and fast deliveries along with value for money , i will recommend them to anyone .
2	they get top score from me .
2	i would not recommend bt , never ever would i recommend a company that has so little respect and concern for its customers .
2	slow slow bt congested exchange that i seem stuck with , and at peek times when i hit a very slow 0mb on my bt land line that cost me an arm and a leg i can just disconnect from it and connect to next doors virgin_media unsecured d - link router and get a 0 . 0mb connection that '_s more than twice as fast .
2	how ?
2	and why ?
2	if its congested how is that even possible or do virgin pay bt a ** bleep ** load of money .
2	i '_ve had this problem now for over 0 months and bt have known about it for
2	about a month .
2	i am battling with bt on a constant week to week basis and its draining .
2	i would like to end my contract with bt but they say im not allowed because i am receiving more than 0 . 0mb on my 0 . 0mb line .
2	i would stay_away from bt if like me your exchange is congested because even_though your line might be rating 0 . 0mb you could end up with it being 00 times slower_than that and still with - in bt '_s pathetic 0 . 0mb acceptable speed .
2	what more could you want .
2	very good value , reliable , fast delivery .
2	i '_ve_used chemist - 0 - u several_times and every time they have been fantastic , i would 000_% recommend them to anyone .
2	their service is second to none .
2	0_star all_round .
2	i paid extra for guaranteed next_day delivery on item ordered hours before the time limit , because i was only going to be home the next_day and not thereafter , but it wasn_'_t delivered - their online tracking_link showed it was picked_up by their delivery company yodel fast enough , but then sat in their warehouse for 00_hours before being allocated for delivery - this was the same as their normal delivery service but at higher price .
2	i would have given a ' poor ' rating but because i received no response to my message sent to their customer service , i '_ve rated sd ' bad '.
2	also , i don_'_t like the way they sneak extras into shopping_basket , trying to catch customers for extra money for their advertising mag - watch for it and delete before paying if you use sorts direct online .
2	very satisfied - i needed a small but important piece of foam cut and delivered in a hurry and they provided at very reasonable cost .
2	pleasure to deal with
2	excellent service - very satisfied
2	i purchased a barbour_jacket , and loads of paul_smith accessories and all of them arrives next_day .
2	they were buitifully wrapped and i found the 0 hour delivery window superb etc .
2	i cant say how amazing this website was and how fantastic the customer_services were when i checked of the order would be dispatched next_day etc .
2	great service
2	easy to use , great rates , first_class .
2	thank_you
2	please read the small_print before booking a car with this company
2	they called to inform_me if i did not pay another £_000 excess_waiver i would be liable for up to £_000 for any damage to the vehicle
2	this worried so much i canceled
2	they then informed me £_00 . 00 would be deducted from my payment because i was 0 hours into the 00 hour cancellation period
2	please read the small_print these are a bunch of cowboys !

2	happy to pass this to others .
2	thank_you
2	however speaking with samantha today was excellent indeed .
2	she was very helpful and professional .

2	all explained to me in understandable terms , kind_regards chris gardner
2	this is a fantastic company to deal with .
2	i ordered the chain_saw and it was delivered the following_day .

2	i fully recommend this company , thank_you
2	chris gardner
2	i was kept_informed at all times as to the status and eta of my delivery .
2	on arrival the delivery driver was smart and courteous .
2	the van was in good condition and clean which gives the impression of quality and professionalism .
2	you end up with the feeling that your package has_been cared for .
2	the actual package was in good condition and had obviously not been mishandled or abused ( thrown around ) on its journey .
2	a very good service !
2	have carried_out a fair_amount of research and have found that edge and wax not only supply an extremely good range of equipment that has obviously been chosen carefully and with experience but offer excellent advice on the website and over the phone as to any particular requirements or needs .
2	well_done everyone !
2	good stuff and keep it up .
2	good selection and economic trophies , but £ 0 . 00 p_&_p on a £ 0 trophy is a rip_off .
2	delivery of 0 to 0 days is unacceptable in these days of next_day delivery .
2	as the heading_says
2	as above good company fast delivery
2	bought this for a 00 y . o .

2	a friend advised me to contact age_partnership as my pension_provider sent me so many forms which i found confusing .

2	the service , from beginning to end , was first_class and i would not_hesitate to use them again or recommend them to others .
2	my thanks again to katie .

2	no_hassle no bother and a good price for top_drawer phones
2	done a hip - furniture review tried to help others from being_conned but they don_'_t want the truth to be shown
2	it '_s just so simple to use .
2	i started out with the completely free service to get a taste , but soon upgraded as everything was seamless , quick and clear .
2	i '_ve_used other web hosts in the past , but this has to be the best as far as i am concerned .
2	can '_t quite believe that such a reliable service can be priced so low .
2	next_day free delivery within 0 hour timeframe texted to me first thing in morning .
2	very satisfied .
2	i wanted to find out what performance i am_currently geting because i am ni the process of changing ( forced by orange withdrawing the package i had signed uo to with a second line ).
2	i hope ( and anticipate based_upon what i have been told that my performance should improve .
2	i bought a samsungeu00es0000 , blu - ray_player , and surround_sound from these_guys last_week .
2	not only are they the cheapest guys on the net but they are without_any doubt whatsoever the most knowledgeable , friendly , fare , reasonable guys i have ever bought anything from on the i - net .
2	words fail me .
2	look no further that these_guys and gals if you want to be satisfied with your electrical purchases .
2	i will never go_anywhere_else again and urge all those reading this to do the same !
2	p . s .
2	i do not have shares in the company nor do i know personally or am i related to anyone at this organisation :) they are just great !
2	web_site easy to use , price match worked well .
2	a slight omission on the order was dealt_with , with a next_day delivery .
2	original delivery was quick also .
2	very helpful and friendly staff .
2	i am happy to recommend this company .
2	excellent service .
2	bought a battery for my caravan which is exactly the right size and capacity to use the mover .
2	i then bought a battery for my discovery td0 which i had to identify as the listed battery was for the older diesel and smaller .
2	i identified the correct battery as a numax c00 - 000 with the terminals on the centre line and this was delivered in the same efficient way as before .
2	the only_negative about this transaction was that the battery finder didn_'_t correctly_identify the battery for this vehicle and still doesn_'_t .
2	this should be corrected and if this was done tayna would be the first battery supplier to get it right .
2	dealers and one on line parts specialist do list the correct type of battery but these are more_expensive .
2	service is still worth the 0_stars .
2	great service speedily delivered and excellent value all_round .
2	i ' l be back !
2	the oven works great , simple to install , simple to use , what more can you ask for ?
2	the web_site is very good and its easy to find and order the product you want .
2	i had a small query and a quick phone_call to a very friendly member of staff sorted it out .
2	the delivery was very prompt and they use dpd as their courier who were terrific .
2	i knew the packages movement all the way through with dates and times .
2	i even knew the van drivers_name .
2	now how bad '_s that .
2	i purchased a bird_box kit plus 0 extra cameras .
2	what was really good was the fact that they had set the extra cameras to work on the different channels , as_opposed to me doing it myself .
2	excellent service .
2	recommend to anyone .
2	product ordered early december for a christmas_present .
2	dispatch supposed to be 0 to 0 days .
2	when it did not arrive , tried to contact many_times by phone , e_- mail and via their website .
2	only managed one contact from them by e_- mail asking for the order number and then nothing further .
2	no response by 00th_january so asked paypal to intervene for me .
2	this worked luckily and the next_day i received an e_- mail from the company and had my money refunded .
2	would not recommend this company to anyone .
2	we were kept up to date when the parcel would arrive .
2	the delivery person was polite and friendly .
2	very good company .
2	product was as_described and arrived promptly .
2	would use again and recommend .
2	can '_t fault cheapsmells .
2	excellent service .

2	will use agin without_doubt .
2	used lfh many time now and they still provide an excellent service .
2	any time i '_ve had to contact them everyone has_been great to talk to and have been more than helpful .
2	have just hired two low f stop lenses to take photos of the northernlights , both arived on time and in excellent condition .
2	using the return courier is just magic .
2	phone them in morning and pick_up was just after 00 noon .
2	brilliant .
2	can '_t praise these_guys enough .
2	i am keeping my fingers_crossed that this level of service continues .
2	excellent value and super - fast delivery .
2	technically , i live offshore .
2	many pet supply companies quibble over this , providing a slow , expensive service .
2	as long as swell keep_up the great service , i can think of no reason to go_anywhere_else .
2	i hope never to have dealings with dpd again .
2	they try to be clever with e_- mail_notifications , on - line tracking and even providing the drivers_name .
2	in fact they are useless .
2	the week before last i received an e_- mail .
2	my delivery was going to be on a friday .
2	then another e_- mail , now on thursday .
2	waited in both days .
2	the package arrived 00 . 00 on friday .
2	misfortune two .
2	a large parcel was meant to be delivered on behalf of richer_sounds on monday .
2	waited in .
2	nothing .
2	tuesday , in all morning .
2	car in drive , windows open , dog in hallway .
2	a ' sorry we missed you ' card in the letter_box .
2	they made no attempt to ring or knock .
2	there is no one i can contact at dpd , so i am cancelling my order with richer_sounds .
2	a big disappointment .
2	in future i will not place an order with anyone that uses this outfit .
2	i was after a reasonably specialised item for an aquatic set - up ( phosphate reactor ).
2	i was amazed that pet_supermarket carries such an item and beat the specialist companies in price and delivery .
2	impressive service .
2	i have purchased here several_times and i have never had any_problems at all .
2	good prices , a lot of products and brands to chose from .
2	at all a top experience .
2	very poor customer_services .. dreadful online systems !!
2	left them in sept_0000 & still_awaiting credit refund in jan_0000 .
2	shouldn_'_t be allowed to trade ..
2	got 0 great penfield shirts from aspecto .. easy to use website & next_day delivery !
2	oh .. got to use my loyalty_card as well :)
2	i have used travel_republic quite a few_times now .
2	easy to use and not a problem yet .
2	definitely recommended .
2	initially had a little problem with website ordering as the web form didn_'_t seem to like my delivery address .
2	phoned up , talked to the web guy , and the next_day i could order without problem .
2	delivery arrived after less_than 00_hours , great service and thank_you .
2	i had used travelpharm before and certainly will do so again .
2	excellent site for booking couriers way cheaper_than going directly to ups , tnt and so on .
2	at - a - glance comparison and speedy booking .
2	booked a one night stay at disneyland_paris .
2	the confirmation_email and voucher arrived within minutes .
2	the next_day i came_across the really bad_reviews about amoma on tripadvisor .
2	to make_sure the reservation had gone_through i emailed the hotel and was told the reservation had been made - no_problems there .
2	i ' d certainly use amoma again , the booking was easy and i got a much_cheaper rate than from other booking sites .
2	excellent website
2	good pricing on all cricket kit
2	prompt , free delivery
2	goods all as_described and high_quality
2	good website , prompt delivery , cricket products exactly as_described
2	came_across buybrandtools . com through an internet_search and and found that they offered the best price i could_find backed_up with good service .
2	excellent .
2	i have used affordable_supplements off and on for over 00 years and they have always delivered great products at great prices .
2	this time i bought raging_beast pre_workout supplement , but held back on this review for a week so that i could be sure to offer a fair product appraisal .
2	so here it goes ;
2	starting with the instructions were a little off , as they advised drinking 00_minutes before a workout .
2	i found that the kickin point for me was circa 00 - 00_minutes .
2	pump :
2	the pump that you should expect from a product like this - i had big expectations - having had good pump results from san v00 turbo many_moons ago , i wanted raging_beast to not only replicate but improve on this .
2	it does .
2	i was able to lift more and the pump is fantastic - and also far_superior to my san results .
2	endurance :
2	i am lifting more for longer - no question about it .
2	but what i found really encouraging is that when i train on free weights ( 00_mins ), then move onto a runner for 0k ( 00_mins and come_back and lift again - i was still getting a fantastic pump .
2	i call that a result
2	recovery :
2	really good recovery with only a hint of muscle fatigue .
2	obviously everyone is different but i would be amazed if you did not see results with raging_beast .
2	whenever i need something for the beach , i head here first .
2	great business to deal with , always helpful and always prompt .
2	the best surf / outdoor_clothing company in the northern hemisphere .
2	i had never used viovet before this order , but i needed a supplier for some aquarium carbon sheet matting which is usually overpriced and not that simple to get hold of .
2	i searched on google and viovet came up as a seller and the website was really well put_together and that they had invested in .
2	the price was very competitive and the overall experience of ordering was excellent .
2	delivery was prompt and they are now firmly in my favourite supplier list .
2	brilliant !
2	great service , better prices , slick delivery and quality livestock - everything i need for my aquarium and highly_recommended .
2	ordered a new pair of oakley flipflops and they arrived next_day and as advertised .
2	an excellent buying experience .
2	never used blackcircles before and would use them again .
2	wanted a quick and easy solution for finding and fitting my tyre of choice ( goodyear wranglers ) and blackcircles completed the brief with simplicity .
2	fast delivery and keen_pricing both on printers and consumables .
2	i have used printerland for several_years which speaks for itself .
2	the website gives plenty of info and drills down quickly and accurately for consumables .
2	also there is someone ( knowledgeable !)
2	at the end of the phone if needed .
2	thoroughly_recommended .
2	arrived the following_day before 0am as agreed .
2	the product was exactly as ordered .
2	excellent swift efficient service .
2	ordered laptop late monday_afternoon .
2	it arrived wednesday_morning and the delivery man did not get an answer as our bell was being erratic so he knocked and looked around the house to see if anyone was around .
2	and found me .
2	the money arrived within 00_hours of ordering it and at the best rate on the day plus no postage_charges .
2	i will_certainly use the currency_club again if they keep_up this level of rate and standard of service .
2	brian .
2	just sent 0 parcels via the chat_window with sarah_h today thursday 00th_sept . she is very efficient , helpful and patient and deserves credit from her supervisor .
2	hope the rest of the service and delivery matches up to her .
2	purchase of us $ using their website was straight_forward and their rates were better_than other_providers , which is easy to check on - line .
2	you chose the day for delivery and the package arrives with your local post person on that day .
2	i do have a small suggestion however in that i feel that the faqs could be better as it is a daunting process to buy lots of currency if you have not done it before or don_'_t regularly do so and i needed to ask a couple of questions just for my own peace of mind and feel that these should have been featured in the faqs , but support was very forthcoming and helpful .
2	their web_site is intuitive and easy to navigate and the product you get is exactly as_described .
2	help is forthcoming , quick and helpful .
2	this is a web_site i can purchase from with confidence .
2	i could not believe the attractive price when surfing the internet to purchase a hero 0 , but took the plunge and was amazed to receive a telephone_call within hours thanking_me for placing my order and assuring me of their customer_care .
2	the camera arrived a couple of days_later , well ahead of the advised delivery date .
2	it is great to find a trustworthy supplier of cameras with such competitive_prices .
2	excellent response to messages and helpful information .
2	key annuity services provided a path through this complex subject that was easy to follow and understand and found the best provider for the annuity .
2	decided to fumigate a small caravan i just purchased .
2	there were small flying things and crawlers and i thought the mini fortefog would do the trick .
2	it didn_'_t .
2	0 hours after activation i re - entered the caravan expecting to see dead insects and crawlers but only found live ones who seemed un bothered with the very small_amount of smoke produced by this product .
2	the product didn_'_t produce enough smoke to fill my small caravan .
2	the company sent a replacement but no different results were obtained .
2	i can '_t recommend this product but the company were quick to respond .
2	i went into my local maplins store in rotherham 00 / 00 / 00 for a couple of diodes .
2	found them in the catalogue priced 00p_each .
2	got 0 and they wanted to charge 00p , i pointed_out they were priced at 00p in the catalogue ( the catalogue they were still selling for £ 0 . 00 ) to be told the catalogue was out of date and the diodes were now 00p_each , take em or leave em .
2	guess_what i did .
2	i won_'_t be going into my maplins store again .
2	i got them off ebay 00 for 00p including_postage .
2	i booked a hotel for my trip to istanbul .
2	( by the way , beware of istanbul traffic when it snows )
2	there were no_problems with the hotel and i pretty_much got what i expected .
2	i needed to add an extra day at the last_minute and the hotels rate was pretty high but sunshine from customer_care made my day and confirmed the extra night in a very timely_fashion .
2	i will_definitely use otel . com again for my next trip
2	cheers
2	this is a great site for any electronical device you are planning to buy .

2	there was excellent and relevant help available on screen or through optional enquiry buttons and you did feel secure and comforted that all was under control and compliant .
2	thank_you .

2	i had ordered from serenata_flowers for my partners_birthday .
2	the flowers arrived with dead heads and were way past their best .
2	when i saw them i was disappointed after having spent more than £_00 . 00 i complained to them and they responded efficiently .
2	they told me i would receive a fresh bunch of flowers and a replacement vase as the original was broken and had cut my partners finger .
2	i supplied to the necessary photo '_s and complied with their procedures .
2	0 week_later , nothing from them , i followed this up with emails and was told that they hadn_'_t received my request , that was a complete lie .
2	this isn_'_t a reputable_company and i would certainly not deal with them again .
2	to add_insult to injury , when i told them to issue a refund to my paypal_account they issued a partial_refund .
2	i turned that into a dispute , they refused to issue the balance of £ 0 . 00 so i have now escalated that within paypal .
2	if you complain , and they make promises to rectify the situation , then they should do as they promise .
2	in this case they haven_'_t .
2	this is not a good company based on my own experience and what i '_ve read about them on google .
2	my wife and i bought an expensive leatherman tool for our son who has just completed his four year electrical apprenticeship .
2	we ordered it engraved from knives and tools . co . uk .
2	we were hoping that this would be a treasured gift that would remind our son of his achievement and our pride in him .
2	other_sites sell leatherman tools and have a better ordering system for the engraving service .
2	– i had to make a customer_services enquiry and was then instructed go to the company ’_s dutch website to see the engraving options and then confirm my instructions via another email .
2	i was very clear in my instructions in that i wanted the largest_size that the area on the handle of the tool would allow for the message to our son .
2	– when i received the knife , i couldn ’_t believe that knives and tools ’ engravers had squeezed the engraving into a groove on the handle .
2	the engraving is so small that it can hardly be read and doesn_’_t appear to accurately reflect the message either .
2	every other site that offers engraving on leatherman tools indicate that engraving on the handle will be on the largest area of flat surface available .
2	following my complaint , despite my very clear_instructions , i have an email from knives and tools . co . uk , stating that “ their engravers chose where to put the engraving .”
2	it ’_s a shame that knives and tools . co . uk can ’_t remember who the customer is and what the customer wants , especially as this is a company selling engraved gifts , which are obviously supposed to be special .
2	knives and tools . co . uk have refused to take back this very expensive item despite their error and distance_selling_regulations .
2	i have had to instruct my credit_card company to investigate the possibility of a chargeback and they are now ignoring my emails .
2	i would advise anybody to seriously reconsider whether or not you want to give knives and tools . co . uk your business !
2	this is not the first time that i have sold broken and unwanted gold jewellery to an online buyer .
2	in the past , i got ' very close ' to what my kitchen scales suggested my gold was worth at the then current price from a different company .
2	i therefore have to assume that my scales are ‘ reasonably accurate enough ’ to provide a close estimate as to what i might expect to be paid for my gold .
2	having_searched the internet for ‘ the best company ’, this time around ‘ gold0pounds ’ were consistently suggested by various_sites as being ‘ the highest payers ’ and ‘ the best customer service .’
2	i have to be very careful here as ‘ gold0pounds ’ have threatened me with ‘ slander .’ so ( as required by review sites anyway ) the following are ‘ facts ’ only and of course , i only speak of my own personal experience .
2	as i am a retired police officer , it appears that at_least in this case , i know a little more about the law than gold0pounds as their threats are based on feedback that i have given them via private emails .
2	– despite the fact my emails only contain ‘ facts ’ and comments that they have chosen to take out of context , nothing in the emails has_been in ‘ the public domain ’ and is between myself and them only .
2	– i have therefore not ‘ slandered ’ them , yet they have threatened me !
2	the weight and purity of the gold that i sent to gold0pounds was ‘ consistently ’ estimated as being worth up to £_000 . 00 with seven other_companies , the lowest estimate being £_00 . 00 .
2	as the suggestion was that gold0pounds consistently paid more than others , i sent my gold to them .
2	i quickly got an email offering me £_00 . 00 !
2	with the comment ," we will process your payment today if you would please reply to this email with your acceptance of our offer ."
2	i replied you ’ re having a laugh .
2	kindly send my gold back .
2	i then received a further email increasing the offer to £_00 . 00 with the following explanation , “ we have been made aware that a few of the items in the pack have failed acid tests , following this a more senior_member of our valuation department has informed us we can make you a new offer of £_00 . 00 .” i have also declined that offer and asked again for my gold to be returned .
2	i always make a point of requesting a ‘ read receipt ’ and a ‘ received receipt ’ for emails that i feel are important .
2	as gold0pounds do not provide receipts for emails , i made sure that i sent my emails to both of the email_addresses that the company uses .
2	i received the following response that i believe is sarcastic and unprofessional and would not have been necessary if they only had the courtesy to agree to the requests for receipts for the emails , - “ thank_you for sending the email twice .”
2	i expressed my disappointment with the offer and my concerns and suspicions as to why the first offer was so low and how they were able to almost double it .
2	gold0pounds are the only such company that i have found this time around that will charge £_00 . 00 for a bacs_payment that other_companies offer free of charge .
2	i expressed my concern that people desperate for cash may have accepted the initial offer and had a further £_00 . 00 deducted for a bacs_payment instead of waiting for the free cheque .
2	at this point gold0pounds accused me of ‘ slander ’ and threatened me with future action stating that they are keeping the emails between us .
2	i await the return of my gold .
2	i have received two_separate consignments from two different suppliers recently , both of whom used tuffnells as the couriers .
2	one consignment was a delivery of marble effect plastic wall boards costing over £_000 . 00 , the other was an order of replacement wardrobe_doors and drawer_fronts costing over £ 0 , 000 . 00 .
2	of the nine wall boards , eight were damaged along a ' tongue and groove ' edge rendering them useless .
2	- these were well_packed and protected by wooden frames and had ' fragile ' warning tape everywhere and anywhere .
2	these would have had to have had some serious abuse in transit to cause the damage that was done .
2	two out eight packages containing my replacement bedroom fronts were ' wet !'
2	and damaged and further packages were also damaged externally .
2	these were also packed extremely carefully by the supplier with polystyrene edge and corner protection and polystyrene separators .
2	the contents of the two wet and damaged boxes had all of the polystyrene protection destroyed leaving the fronts to rub and bang together in transit .
2	it is by sheer good fortune that nothing was damaged .
2	it angers me that any courier shows such disrespect for customers ' goods that they are quite obviously thrown with sufficient force to cause this sort of damage and allowed to get wet !
2	i have used fonebank before .
2	however , i was tempted by cash0phones highest offer for my wife '_s htc_wildfire which had been in a case from new .
2	- therefore it was in ' as new condition .'
2	needless to say , i hadn_'_t read_reviews on cash0phones and fell foul of their ' bog_standard operating scam ' when they down valued the phone .
2	i got the phone back , sent it to fonebank and got the full offered price within two_days .
2	- fast , no_hassle , no scams !
2	i would use fonebank again .
2	don_'_t assume that i am a one off unhappy punter .
2	cash0phones . co . uk have a ' standard operating method '
2	cash0phones . co . uk ' may ' indicate that they will give you more for your phone than anybody_else .
2	beware !
2	read_reviews first .
2	i sent my wife '_s htc_wildfire after they offered over £_00 . 00 for it .
2	the phone is less_than a year_old , has always had a screen_protector on it and has_been inside a ' flip cover ' from the minute it was taken out of the box .
2	it was in perfect working order and completely unmarked .
2	( never , never , never send a mobile_phone to any of these companies using their freepost_address only .
2	( most people don_'_t know that you only need to pay for the signed for service ( about 00p ) with a freepost_envelope ) i did this once and the company denied receiving it .
2	i contacted them and said , " that '_s fine .
2	either it '_s gone_missing in the post or you '_ve lost it .
2	- as mobile_phones are traceable , whoever has got it now has committed theft by finding as it hasn_'_t found it '_s way back to me .
2	- i '_m going to report it as stolen and have it blocked so that it '_s worthless ."
2	- guess_what - i was phoned back very quickly and told that they ' d found it and got my full payment !)
2	anyway .
2	- interestingly , cash0phones send you the flimsiest envelope that i have ever_seen !
2	- i '_m thinking , ' here we go , another excuse to claim that the phone wasn_'_t sufficiently protected in transit and pay out less_than was indicated .'
2	- i wrapped the phone in several_layers of foam ' wrap ' then enclosed that in the order slip , then enclosed all of that in a sort of two piece foam box .
2	when cash0phones emailed to say that they had received the phone they amended their offer from over £_00 . 00 to £_00 . 00 claiming " excessive_wear and tear ."
2	they then add_insult to injury by demanding £ 0 . 00 for return p_&_p for a package that costs £ 0 . 00 to post by recorded delivery .
2	- absolutely_disgraceful !!
2	!
2	update - ok , so i posted the above review on trustpilot and then notified cash0phones inviting them to read it .
2	- within hours i received a phone_call from them stating that they had made a mistake !!!
2	- my wife '_s phone was in good condition !!!
2	- however , it was not the model that i claimed it to be so therefore still wasn_'_t worth the originally_quoted value !!!
2	- unbelievable .
2	- how many different ' angles of scam ' will these_people use to rip people off .
2	i told them to return the phone .
2	that was eight days ago and i still_haven_'_t had it back !
2	based on reviews where they have used the same angle again and again , they simply should not be trading and should be closed_down .
2	take the time to read all other reviews for your own sake !
2	i bought a new canon_eos 00d with three lenses from digitalrev and the camera , " wow " !
2	and the service was perfect .
2	thankyou digitalrev !

2	i ordered a product which the saverstore website stated was ' in stock ' and would be sent within three_days .
2	after i placed the order , the status on my order was changed to ' awaiting stock '.
2	the three day deadline was then not met .
2	i looked again at the product range on their website , and was surprised to see saverstore was still saying the product i had ordered was ' in stock '.
2	after two_weeks , i received an email from saverstore that the product i had ordered was not available and that it would refund my payment .
2	i went to lambda - tek and ordered the product from them instead for the same price and lamba - tek delivered it to me within 00_hours .
2	i was very pleased to receive my order in just one day from lambda - tek .
2	the product i ordered was about the lowest_price i could_find online .
2	it was delivered well - packaged and the online tracking was helpful too .
2	i had previously tried to order the product from a different online company , saverstore , but they failed to deliver the product , so i was extremely happy with the lambda - tek service .
2	i contacted them to find out the correct parts for my focus as two types are listed .
2	they then shipped the parts promptly and were half the cost of the ford_dealer .
2	i too will be using them again .
2	i heard about lenses for hire from a friend .
2	i had recently_bought a nikon_d000 and was about to go on a short trip to venice without an ultra wide_angle lens .
2	i rented a nikon 00 - 00mm_lens for a very reasonable fee .
2	it arrived exactly when they said it would and was packed as well as i think i '_ve seen a lens be packed .
2	the equipment was in perfect_condition and a joy to use .
2	i would have no_hesitation in recommending this firm to anyone_seeking to hire a lens .
2	i received my lens within 0 days in perfect_condition .
2	excellent service .
2	i ordered a lens from simply_electronics on 0 / 0 / 00 and they took my money straight_away .
2	after 0_weeks of false_promises i never received the lens so i requested a refund .
2	it '_s now 00 / 0 / 00 and i '_ve not had a refund .
2	quatropi oh that '_s that company i stumbled on when looking for some book shelves for my dvd '_s brought two set of those , what a great product exactly_what i wanted , then i found a hall table knocked my socks of both the quality and service , marble and polished stainless_steel thick glass top and heavy everyone that comes through the front_door mentions it i do tell them where it came from but have to add it was the end of that line ( shame you can '_t have one ) well the relationship with this company continues , just waiting for the latest accusition to arrive should have been here on tuesday but we had a little snow here no problem it '_s coming friday can '_t ask for better_than that can you .
2	what next ?
2	well we have been looking at the garden_furniture and ............
2	i put in my order on the sunday_night and i received it on the wednesday , over here in the netherlands !
2	great service , have been buying from them now for over a year .
2	i would highly_recommend them .

2	my first ftp experience was with a friend who had his own server , that meant he did all the donkey work for me .
2	when i left his server i had to find someone quick to host my sites .
2	i found lcn and have never_regretted it .
2	i am a bit careles with passwords usernames etc .
2	as i expect quite a few of us there .
2	ringing lcn with a problem has always been an easy and pleasant_experience .
2	i will carry on with lcn and i do recommend lcn to others .

2	friends tell me if you phone round oil companies you can get cheaper prices than via boilerjuice .
2	this may be the case , but i am sure only marginal and the bj service is so quick and easy , with post order communications always first_class .
2	these tiny 0mm_x_0mm neodymium_magnets are incredibly strong and the service from first0magnets was first_class , order delivered in one working day
2	order placed over a weekend , delivered to my house first thing tuesday_morning
2	brilliant service

2	great selection and great service - i would recommend them to anyone .
2	just to say thanks for your great and quick service even_though it was a long bank_holiday_weekend .
2	your video_clip on how to test and change the solenoid and valve was really useful and made the repair all the quicker .
2	our shower is now back up and running and i have a happy household again .
2	i '_ve been an ebuyer customer for years .
2	they have always provided me with the items i want at competitive_prices along with excellent service .
2	the whole_process from_start to finish has_been hassle_free and easy .
2	the staff have been great throughout the process giving me all the infomation i needed .
2	the process itself was painless and quick , the results were immediate and within 00_hours i could drive .
2	i can wholeheartedly reccomend this process .
2	i can '_t praise simplygames highly_enough . preordered bioshock_infinite for a bargain £_00 . 00 with free delivery and it was back within 0 days .
2	website easy to use and found what i was seeking without difficulty .
2	goods arrived next_day .
2	easy website and found exactly_what i wanted at the right price .
2	delivered at a time to suit me and brilliant communications both by email and text to let_me know when my goods would be delivered .
2	we moved_into our retirement bungalow and decided to splash_out on some fitted wardrobes .
2	from our first meeting with the sales lady , who was very professional and helped_us decide on our exact_requirements , to the fitter who made an excellent job of building the wardrobes , we are very happy .
2	the parts came sooner_than we were told so were therefore fitted sooner .
2	it makes our room look very streamlined and tidy , having everything behimd closed doors .
2	all in all we are very pleased with the end_result and would not_hesitate on recommending sharps to anyone .
2	we recently ordered a new hisense american_fridge_freezer as our old samsung one was breaking_down too often .
2	our flat is on the 0st floor and has 00 steps .
2	this has_been an issue in the past when ordering from currys and other_firms .
2	i discussed this with ao . com and they said there would be no problem .
2	the firm ao . com used came the next_day and dismantled the old samsung and put in the new hisense .
2	it was a difficult job but i was impressed how they handled it .
2	i would definitely recommend them to my friends .
2	anyvan were very helpful in assisting where necessary in the ordering of a van to delivery a sideboard .
2	the van driver in question was very polite and prompt and the sideboard was delivered in a timely basis .
2	i would recommend them to my friends and use them again .
2	my partner recommended travel_fx .
2	said they had the best rates and excellent service .
2	have just done my second transaction and i feel_confident the euros will arrive next tuesday as indicated .
2	i read the reviews before i visited the denelli premises in milton_keynes .
2	the staff were very helpful and the sofa samples gave_me a good idea of what i wanted .
2	i would highly_recommend buying sofa '_s from denelli .
2	it is very easy using the website to make a tyre selection .
2	the tyre garages i have used are very helpful and efficient .
2	i recommend using easyeta as the name_suggests it was very easy to use the site and an excellent and prompt service could not believe_how quick the visa '_s came through well_done
2	picked_up the 0rd for a 00hr delivery , delivered the 0th .
2	these were brake_discs and when the late morning of the 0th arrived i had had enough and drove a 00 mile_round_trip to buy some from elsewhere , costing me £_00 more than the ebay ones for poorer quality and £_00 for fuel in a friend '_s car .
2	would you believe it , just as i was getting home a yodel driver turned_up with the ones off ebay .
2	you charge sellers for o / night delivery , why don_'_t you stick to it ??
2	?
2	the seller is also at fault for not marking as despatched or providing any tracking_details .
2	all in all yodel has to be the worst delivery company in the country for sure .
2	i had to change the dates i was going on holiday ( an easyjet package ).
2	i made the change less_than 00hrs since paying and the brochure price for the new holiday was over £_000 cheaper yet they gave_me £_00 back , it would have been cheaper to go to the travel_agents , they tell me there would have been no charge for this , but how do you fight your corner properly at the end of a phone ( which by the way cost me over £ 0 )
2	spent a great deal of my life talking to indians like greg who in the end cannot help you and transfer you .
2	stop using indian_call_centres , all you do is wing us up !
2	buy same product from my local pizza house for a third of the price
2	check the reviews before you order , there are some really dodgy takeaways on my site
2	if you like to keep to the same stuff all the time then ok , but the variety is very minimal on the food side .
2	the fresh and frozen_food is costly .
2	the special non food items they get in are good value but be quick as they only sell a few .
2	but beware of network_coverage
2	great choices and great prices
2	have great luck with them , lots of info for you to decide
2	£_000 for a name change ??
2	?
2	cheapest in town
2	great value
2	great hard to find designer wear all in one place .
2	five_star service five_star items a pleasure to do_business .

2	fantastic doing_business with professionals .
2	well_done
2	thank_you bookatrack for the most wonderful driving experience of my life ( so_far ).
2	there was a good mix of cars on the track but not too many , the briefing was spot - on and the driving_standards superb .
2	i must_say that the " pay and play " caterham drivers were the most sensible and courteous on the track .
2	the " semi - pro " drivers tended to be the least courteous , perhaps they were using the track for cheap testing and us poor fools in road cars were crowding the track for them .
2	( mainly the guy in the white gt0 that didn_'_t understand the term " overtake on the left ").
2	the venue and facilities were just awesome and the organisation was excellent too .
2	it is a concern when you take your pride and joy to a track day and thanks to stuart ( instructor ) for helping_me get the most out of the day .
2	i strongly_recommend that everybody gets some intruction , regardless of your perceived ability , you will be safer and your car will be faster and smoother if you drive the lines that suit your car : the racing line isn_'_t always best for every car !
2	i will_certainly be back again , as will all of our group that attanded this time .
2	a big thank_you to all at bookatrack .
2	ordered 0 x batteries .
2	a few_days_later ( 0 days ago - 0 ' working ' days ago ) an email informed me that the items had been dispatched - they still_haven_'_t arrived , so it '_s not looking very good so_far !
2	recently ordered a canon scanner from this company - ordered at 00am on the thursday using their ' free postsage service '.
2	it arrived 00am on the friday - less_than 00_hours - that level of service will take some_beating !
2	arrived packed well and in perfect_condition .
2	it '_s my second excellent dealing_with this company - so i have to give them a five_star_rating .
2	however , looking through all the reviews it seems that they may not be so hot if you have problems and need to return your item .
2	pity , really , as otherwise they ' d be top_notch .
2	so , had two great experiences ordering items from here - now just got to hope i don_'_t experience any ' under guarantee ' faults with them .
2	keep your fingers_crossed for me !
2	;^)
2	i ordered a canon scanner as the price seemed very reasonable , and the website indicated they were in stock .
2	having heard_nothing for a week , and my order status on their site was still given as ' processing ', i had to write to them .
2	discovered they were actually out of stock , and had no idea when new stock would be in .
2	despite all the spiel on their site about how they will inform you if they don_'_t have the stock , and let you know when it is expected to be in , i got the impression they were actually trying to hide the fact - possibly hoping to hang on to my order until such time that they did obtain the stock .
2	quite disappointing compared to dealings i '_ve had with most other internet companies .
2	i '_ve since cancelled my order , and obtained the item from another source - a few_pounds more , but at_least i '_ll get it !
2	sorry , i can '_t see any reason to give this company more than a 0_star_rating .
2	addendum : subsequently ordered the item from oyyy - 00am thurs using their ' free_postage service '.
2	the item arrived 00am friday !!
2	less_than 00_hours - now that '_s more like it !
2	i ordered a nokia_lumia 0000 from simply_electronics last_week , where it was reported as being in - stock and usually dispatched within 0 - 0 days .
2	three_days_later , the status of the item was unchanged ( i . e .
2	order received ) even_though the item was still shown as being in - stock on the web - site .
2	i queried the current_position with them , and was still offered no definite shipping date .
2	on checking my credit_card statement , i saw they had already charged me - which i believe to be against visa and mastercard regulations .
2	more worryingly , they have an faq_section that states pre_- charging of the card prior to delivering the goods is their standard_practice .
2	i have since cancelled my order , and am now awaiting a credit for something that should not have been charged in the first place .
2	i am no legal expert , so i will be pursuing this with my credit_card company to find out what the definitive position is in this regard , in the hope of having simply amend their policy for others .
2	additional comments responding to simply_electronics response 00 / 00 /_0000 :
2	i was aware of the 0 - 00 day delivery time frame , as i was informed via_email after ordering from the web - site , which had stated the item was in stock and usually delivered in 0 - 0 days !
2	also , i only cancelled the order after 0 days , at which point the order status had remained unchanged .
2	during the cancellation email exchange , simply attempted to persuade me not to by offering a free universal card_reader .
2	however , they still could not offer me a definitive delivery date !
2	consequently , i proceeded with the cancellation .
2	i recently ordered a samsung mega smartphone from these_guys .
2	during processing of my order , everything_went ok , apart_from a lack of confirmation by the website after paying by credit_card and following the 0d secure payment process .
2	however , i received an email_confirming the order was placed , and was then able to track the order via the web - site .
2	so_far so good .
2	the order tracking stated an estimated delivery date of 00th - 00th_july .
2	on the morning of the 00th i rang their customer_services to see where things were .
2	i was then informed that the stock they had for the phone i ordered ( 00gb version in black ) had all got 0gb devices in them by mistake - so would not be able to get the phone .
2	i . e .
2	the web - site estimated delivery was fiction .
2	( for the record , the lady that dealt_with me on the phone was very pleasant and efficient )
2	they emailed me an offer of a white one , which i subsequently declined , and requested order cancellation .
2	i tried to cancel the order via the web - site , but it would not let_me , as the order was at a stage requiring human intervention .
2	i have emailed them 0 times , and today tried to track my order to see if had been cancelled .
2	the web - site reported " error 000 " and claimed to be so busy , i would have to try later !!
2	!
2	i have tried again to ring customer_services , but it puts you on hold , and eventually reports all lines are busy - please try later .
2	not impressed .
2	fast delivery , great service
2	fantastic to look at !
2	a real conversation piece , everybody comments and asks where we bought it . looks great and finishes the kitchen off perfectly . great price and next_day delivery . can '_t fault them !
2	!
2	really fast service from_start to finish . would highly_recommend to anyone !
2	i have used alpharooms b 0 but first time i booked all my travel with them ( the same flight was £_00 cheaper then the airlines web_site )
2	everything was send to me in emails i booked meals and seats , and then transfer from airport to hotel

2	i would recommend this to any of my friends as it was so easy to use and arrange and from the start to the finish including having my tyres_fitted
2	i '_ve only been vaping for a couple of months and i '_ve struggled to find an e_- liquid i really like until i stumbled_across vaper train .
2	i looked at their e_- liquids and saw a recommendation for walkeroma .
2	i was a bit_hesitant as it '_s described as " nutty and creamy in character ".
2	( the last recommended e_- liquid i bought was described as " having a liquorice finish ".
2	it has more than a liquorice finish , it had a start and middle too !
2	it was horrible ).
2	walkeroma however is exactly as_described .
2	it '_s got a slight nuttiness , lovely creaminess and doesn_'_t leave my throat and mouth dry .
2	i could vape this non - stop all day .
2	excellent product .
2	excellent service , i can '_t recommend vaper train highly_enough .
2	full years worth of hay_fever relief for less_than the brand_names one months worth , great value , also delivery was extremely quick and free .

2	without trawling the whole web national_shower_spares came up with a very reasonable price .
2	delivered exactly_what i needed and in a short_space of time .
2	couldn_'_t have asked for more .
2	will_certainly be using them again .
2	i think you need to go a long way to beat appliances on line .
2	prices are good and service is second to none .
2	could have done without the phone_call afterwards though trying to sell extended_warranty
2	bought a new bristan_shower to replace one broken by an alleged professional bathroom installation company .
2	cheapest i could_find on the net from plumbclick .

2	excellent service .
2	nothing is a hassle for them .
2	i recently_purchased a cartomizer that turned_out to be faulty .
2	they told me to send to send it back and they would send a replacement asap .

2	kind_regards , eddie from livingston .
2	ordering was easy , and a good selection of sizes ( although would have liked an option of 0 inch increments )
2	emails to say when the shipment was shipped , when it would arrive , and tracking possibilities made it easy to follow the progress of the order .
2	all in all excellent service , an excellent product , and a great british company you can be proud of .
2	excellent service , fast delivery , and better service than the " big " competition .
2	will_definately be buying all future games and accessories from here for my ps0 and my xbox_000
2	selling a mobile was very simple with mazuma_mobile , all i had to do was enter a few very simple questions and i got a price for the phone , then click a button if i wanted to sell it , it took less_than 00_minutes to sell , i was then posted an envelope for the phone that was pre_- paid , sent the phone off and in less_than a week i had a cheque .

2	:-)

2	it came very well_packed in a sturdy case , and as a bonus gear0music put in a battery and headphones that where not listed .
2	the condition of the violin is very good , it feels sturdy and looks_like it was made to a very high_standard .
2	the violin plays very well and the bridge is securely attached which in some models at this price you can have problems .
2	overall i am extremely happy with this purchase and would not_hesitate to use this company again .

2	i found that the photo of the part helped_me determine exactly_what i wanted , and the opportunity for selecting only parts for a single model was particularly helpful .
2	the part was reasonably_priced , arrived ahead of schedule and is now installed and the dishwasher works again .
2	enough said .

2	excellent prices and ease of service from this website , i have used before but , although blackcircles part of the deal was excellent they have changed the tyre depot to use to get the tyres_fitted .
2	before it was spotless and efficient unfortunately this new depot was somewhat the opposite , very dirty employees and i had my son with me and the boss was communicating with a customer in hear shot swearing and generally not really bothered my young son was standing practically next to him , very unprofessional ..
2	so definately not using this depot again !!!
2	!
2	tyres , good make , great road holding but very very noisey , ten times worse than the michelins they replaced , so would not recommend them
2	this is the first time i '_ve bought a laptop online and it was a good experience .
2	i used the query service to verify a couple of things and got a prompt reply that answered my question fully .
2	price of the product was good and postage was cheap .
2	it arrived on time and i '_m very happy .
2	would recommend laptops direct to others in the basis of this transaction

2	as with liam before , paid for royal_mail 00 , that was 00 days ago . emailed to no_avail . asked if the r / mail now did a royal mail000 service and was i entitled to a rebate . guess_what , no answer .
2	this service is absolutely despicable and would recommend you go_elsewhere .
2	ps , still_havent recieved anything .
2	i , ve been taking them for a couple of weeks now and i dont_think i can get any better , why dont you try them . dont need proof , just look at me . just waiting for my next blood test as proof .
2	we have always found mazuma the fastest , most reliable , and the easiest to use .
2	other_sites might offer a little more money , but mazuma '_s service far out wieghs the slight differance .
2	great staff who know what they ` re_talking_about and look after the customers interest at all times .
2	what an effective combination !

2	i used outdoor_gb for the first time about a year_ago with an initial purchase to check out how good they were .
2	i wasn_'_t disappointed , i got the stuff i wanted at a great price and the service was top_notch .
2	they ' re now right up there when i need outdoor_gear and always one of my first points of call

2	i ordered a door to match our existing 0000 '_s 0 - panel doors .
2	the door was delivered on time without problems .

2	we are both using iflorist for mother '_s day because the quality was so good and the price so reasonable .

2	i bought a dx0i and a blade 000sr but when they arrived they would not bind .
2	i was told by the shop to send them back at my own cost £_00 postage .
2	when they got them they said that there was nothing wrong and it was working so they sent them back to me .
2	after i got them guess_what they would not bind .
2	i traveled to a model shop 00 miles_away and when he tested them he told me that the sr000 was faulty so i phoned wheel spin who told me to send them back again and they would have to send it away to be tested by horizon hobby !
2	remember £_00 to post ?
2	not an offer to replace but that they would have to send it away to be tested !
2	the shop owner who tested them for me offered to take it of my hands and he would send it away to be replaced .
2	sorted by someone_who i did not even buy it off !
2	i would not deal with this company !
2	reply : the fact remains that the item was faulty when i sent it to you and remained faulty on its return to me .
2	this was also confirmed by a local_dealer .
2	why did you not refund me when i ask you to instead of returning the parts .
2	i am out of pocket £_00 on return postage_charges as per your terms .
2	people if you buy from them you must pay all postage_charges even if it is faulty !
2	be warned
2	jed eaton was our sales_guy , very efficient , fast , great pricing and no bs .
2	i deal with merchants at other_businesses and will seek to change !
2	!
2	web_site was easy to use .
2	searched and found what i was looking for without_any_problems .
2	proceeded to checkout which was smooth and efficient .
2	goods arrived a couple of days_later - well_packaged , delighted with service and will_certainly use the site again .
2	web_site was very easy to use , including payment process .
2	very fast delivery too .
2	wish more companies were like this .
2	easy booking at a good price what more could you wish for , the parking was fine last time lets_hope its the same again this time .
2	i have bought several of this companies products , and they have all been distinctive and of a great quality , wrong_size ?
2	doesn_'_t quite fit as you wish ?, no problem they will exchange to ensure your satisfaction . their customer service is second to none . highly_recommended .
2	will be using again .
2	ordered boiler on line , delivered a couple of days_later by a local merchant , brill service and price . will use again
2	unfortunately due to health problems we had to cancel our planned cruise only 0 days prior to departure , i rang up cancelled and was told they would issue a refund and that in the next few_days it would appear on the card i had used .. true to their word the refund duly_arrived , at_least that was one problem out of the way .
2	many_thanks for a truly excellent transaction , i will not_hesitate to use this company again next time .
2	i wandered onto their website after looking at several other_sites for tickets for pink in manchester .
2	i was astonished to see tickets in the vip block offered at far better prices than the other_sites rubbish seats .
2	i felt a little_bit uneasy placing an order after the recent kerfuffle with loads of fraudulent online ticket outlets , but decided to let my credit_card take the strain !
2	tickets arrived today , perfect service .
2	found fonehub through google and their offer was the best for my daughter '_s old phone .
2	cheque for the amount offered arrived very quickly .
2	excellent service .
2	correct goods arrived promptly , in good condition and at a competitive price .
2	a good product , easily fitted with good instructions .
2	the web_site is easily_navigated and the ordering_process simple to follow .
2	the goods took over a week to arrive well within the up to 00 days the web_site suggested it could take due to the items coming from a depot in europe .
2	however i was exasperated to receive customer feedback / buying experience e_- mail after 0 days asking for a review when i had not yet received the goods ???????????.
2	this annoyed me as it would be " good practice " for this feedback request to go out to customers at a time when they are likely to have actually received the goods and had the proper time to appraise etc .
2	( customer_services please take_note !!!)
2	i posted a review in the heat of the moment and actually i think used the b word once suggesting it might be better to allow at_least the 00 days possible delivery before bombarding the customer with requests for buying feedback .
2	i also praised the company for the ease of ordering and the easy to navigate web_site but as they were so upset at the use of course language ( 0 b word ) they complained and had the post removed .
2	i hope the company reviews their feedback procedure in the future and allows the appropriate time to elapse before requesting such information .
2	i should also like to apologise for the use of a course word in my original review and state for the record that after spending £_000 . 00 on your company products i would use you again and would recommend your products .
2	the ordering_process is easy , there is a great range and delivery is super - fast !
2	prices aren_'_t bad either !!
2	!
2	mattressman make the whole_process very simple .
2	the online_chat works well , and it is reassuring that they recommend an appropriate mattress and not the most expensive !
2	next_day delivery is an added_bonus !!
2	!
2	order placed on friday - delivered on monday before 00 . 00 .
2	great people to deal with - it '_s how internet_shopping should be !
2	!
2	well_done and thankyou
2	i would recommended , mr_memory , great services and products
2	still_waiting for a corrected bill after 0 months .
2	they tried to charge me for 0000 units more than what scotish power had told them when i luckily changed supplier .
2	good job i cancelled the direct_debit .
2	i just wish they would take me to court .
2	every time i ring or email i get the same answer , they tell me to ignore the bill and they have put a stop on any future bills or demanding letters .
2	but i still get them .
2	now i have received debt_collectors letter and after i explained to them , they said how incompetent first_utility are .
2	anyway received an email_saying they would send out another bill , but even the readings on that email are wrong , so i wont hold my breath .
2	please , please_please do not use or switch to this company , you will have nothing but trouble .
2	looking_forward to the court case !!
2	!
2	would recommend these_guys .
2	always a great service and fast delivery .
2	placed my order on wednesday , delivered on thursday delivered in less_than 00_hours service cannot be_faulted
2	excellent quality , well made , comfortable
2	mazuma do everything all you have to do is put the item in a package supplied and post as soon as they have recieved the item the moneys in your account
2	i tried them because the coffee is inexpensive compared to proper nespresso .
2	however the taste is poor and the pods are really cheap and don_'_t seem to be solidly packed with coffee .
2	will be going back to nespresso .
2	ao . com is amazing - really friendly people and a great array of products to choose from , all at competitive_prices .
2	my washer_dryer was a good price and a great spec and the guys who delivered it were excellent , taking my old one away and all the packaging from the new one .
2	i '_ve bought a few items from procook over the last 0 months , both from their store near mansfield and online .
2	i have 0 pans , several utensils and just last_week i received my cast - iron griddle .
2	the quality of their products is excellent and , although they ' re not the cheapest , they ' re good value for money .
2	i love my procook stuff .
2	i spent a lot of time comparing lap tops on many sites and in some stores .
2	i selected save on laptops because the product had the best spec to meet my requirements at the best price .
2	the feedback on them was mostly very positive too .
2	it was a great price and the service was excellent .
2	it arrived when i was told it would .
2	i '_m really pleased with it .
2	ok friend this is to let you know the flowers were delivered on time and in good condition .
2	i must_admit to some intrepidation
2	when you informed me that you were using yodel to effect delivery , as my previous_experiences with this carrier have been nightmarish , so very pleasantly_surprised that it all went so smoothly .
2	i very much_appreciated the updates that you sent through as the order was being_processed , and i have absolutely no_hesitation whatsoever in recommending your company as a great supplier of flowers .
2	the recipient an 00 year_old lady was delighted with them .
2	so to end , and in keeping with the tone of your updates to me , the king will now leave the building !
2	!
2	thank_you .
2	when oh when are amazon going to start listening to their customers and ditch the apology for a delivery company called hdnl ( yodel ).
2	other well_known companies have already done so ie john_lewis matalan etc so what is stopping amazon .
2	i ordered an item using the free trial of amazon_prime , pay them 00 quid and then get free or cheaper delivery charges for a year .
2	received an email_confirming the order and giving delivery date today 00 / 00 .
2	have stayed in all day waiting to receive the delivery having followed the tracking of it upto 0000 this morning .
2	neither myself nor my wife have left our home even for a minute .
2	at 0000 there is an entry on the tracking site ' returned to seller - refused by customer '.
2	now today being friday this is not going to be delivered until monday at the earliest , which means another day wasted waiting for the van .
2	amazon are very sorry and have contacted the delivery company who confirm it will be monday ( if i am lucky ).
2	this is not the first time i have had such bad service from this mickey_mouse outfit , but it will be the last , as it is my intention to inform amazon that any future orders that are scheduled to be delivery by this shambles , will be cancelled .
2	perhaps if they start losing customers they will do something about their delivery practices
2	i would like to take part in your draw , but unfortunately have withdrawn my initial feedback due to the companys immoral practise of editing customers comments in order to better the companys image .
2	this has resulted_in a lost customer with very negative feelings towards dv000
2	have been using amazon for a few_years_now , not only grat value , but prompt delivery , and items that were lost over the christmas_period some two years_ago during that bad winter , were raplaced and arrived in time for the day .
2	cannot_fault them , ease of shopping and payment .
2	keep it up .
2	you would not like what i have to say , never again ,
2	we needed a couple of continental 0 gang trailing sockets for some stage lights ( par cans ) that we ' d bought .
2	rather_than wait_until we went to france next i seacged pon google and found kenable ....
2	clear web_site and fast and efficient service , updates by e_- mail and super_fast delivery considering it was 00 days befroe christmas ...
2	highly_recommended .
2	p . h . bandleader
2	very good communication , excellent condition and very fast delivery .
2	terrific service and very early next_day delivery .
2	i can only rate this company very highly !
2	excellent speedy service .
2	i am most impressed with the pricing and the quality of the lenses
2	before i made the decision to go_ahead with laser_surgery i was a little_sceptical as i had had problems years_ago trying out contact_lenses , but i can safely say that this has_been the best decision on my own health and wellbeing .
2	quite_simply , it has_improved my confidence and ability to broaden my overall fitness as i can now exercise in so many different_ways ..
2	the very fact that i timed it perfectly to take_advantage of a special_offer so it cost me only 00_% of the first price quoted just made my mind up to go for it .
2	just go for it !
2	having reached 00 this year , i had decided to climb kilimanjaro to show i wasn_'_t over the hill , and my 0 grown up children were keen to join me .
2	the private kilimanjaro uk team were very helpful , answering all our queries and making_sure things ran_smoothly .
2	our tanzanian guides were brilliant .
2	they were fun , always keen to help and seemed to know the way to get the best out of us so that all of us successfully reached the summit .
2	all the team of porters and cooks were helpful and friendly too , gathering round on rob ’_s birthday to sing happy birthday and the kilimanjaro song .
2	we all had a great time and felt well looked after throughout the trip .
2	“ from the showroom to delivery , you did not over promise or under deliver .
2	the furniture is a quality and attractive product , well made , excellently_packed and good value for money . i would have no_hesitation in recommending oak_furniture_land to anyone .
2	we '_ll be back .
2	p s spenceley ”
2	order arrived next_day and does everything i need it for , would definitely buy from them again .
2	i use evaq0 because i know they deliver promptly and always receive the complete order .
2	best regards
2	john phythian
2	would recommend to anyone !
2	with the spiraling costs of vet fees and the current shortage of cash it was nice to find viovet .
2	the cat medicine cost and vet consultation fees were above £_00 .
2	now i can get her medicine at a mere fraction of that .
2	absolutely_delighted .
2	both my cat figgy and say thank_you . "
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending viovet to everyone .
2	from the time we were picked_up at the designated meeting place to being dropped back off , aerosaurus personnel were very professional , but fun .
2	i would definitely like to balloon with them again .
2	nothing to be afraid of even if you suffer from vertigo , you are in excellent hands .
2	needed a new windows 0 software and was surprised at the reliable service received
2	highly_recommended ,
2	never used this company before so i thought i would try it out as the prices where very reasonable .
2	made my order for a crutch / wheelchair bag on the weekend .
2	arrived on the tuesday .
2	when i opened the bag i was not expecting a such a quality item so i was well impressed .
2	this bag is so well made and strong .
2	i will more than likely order more items as and when needed and as long as the prices are right .
2	thank_you for a quality item .
2	the web - site to make the booking was simply and clear .
2	everything that was booked was in place when i arrived at york station and the drop_off procedure quick and efficient .
2	a no_hassle car_hire experience .
2	first_class service over a 0 year period .
2	i saw these on ebay and thought that '_s a good price for those , looked a bit closer and bought them , delivered really quick , very pleased with the service i got .
2	you can buy allmost anything
2	no more adds great .
2	quick easy simple a pensioner can do it
2	the booking experience was good but despite enquiries on delivery and promises of a dispatch date .
2	when the tickets had not arrived two_days before the concert - we had to fly to the event - we ended_up chasing the courier and had to collect from their office rather then have them delivered .
2	sadly this soured an otherwise pleasant_experience .
2	having not used this type of website before and having old_phones_lying_around i was sceptical but went with my instinct after_reading_reviews , what can i say ?
2	service was fantastic , seamless and goos prices paid - well_done mazumba !
2	first time using this company .
2	prices were as good if not better_than most . and delivery free .
2	ordering was simple and communication ref delivery was first_class .
2	will use again without_hesitation .
2	ordered monday , delivered wednesday .
2	great service and a perfectly working hdmi_cable .
2	i would recommend this company and its products .
2	easy ordering , good prices , first_class delivery .
2	i ordered , it arrived 00_hours_later , i installed it and it worked_perfectly .
2	can '_t really ask for more than that !
2	easy to book , picked_up as stated and delivered as stated .
2	what more can you ask .
2	i bought dog_food from monster_pet_supplies and was given a tracking_number for my parcel .
2	i tried to track it but the system said the number was invalid .
2	i phoned yodel , gave them the number and they were able to track it .
2	the person said that it would be delivered that day but could not give me a better estimate than between 00 . 00 - 00 . 00 .
2	i waited in all day but no delivery .
2	it was actually delivered the following_day and left_outside the house .
2	a written complaint only got the reply that the tracking_number was incvalid so they could not comment
2	we checked many companies on the internet looking for the best price for arden_grange light dog_food .
2	monster gave_us this .
2	their email order confirmaton also gave_us a delivery tracking_number .
2	on the day delivery was due , we tried to track it via computer but got the answer that the number was unknown .
2	we then phoned yodel ( their delivery agent ) and were told that it would be that day but could give us no estimate of time except - between 00 . 00 - 00 . 00 .
2	we waited in and there was no delivery .
2	it arrived next_day when we were out .
2	i have written to monster suggesting that they review their use of this delivery company .
2	they have written back apologising for the problem
2	ordered middle of the day and was delivered middle of next_day .
2	email received to let_me know what time it would be delivered ( within an_hour ) so that i did not have to stay in waiting .
2	cannot recommend them highly_enough
2	easy to order , good price and very quick delivery .
2	00 / 00
2	i needed a chrome waste outlet for our shower , not the ' all in one ' jobby in the diy_store ... as the waste and trap were already installed ... and it had to be chrome_plated metal , not plastic , and victorian_plumbing had exactly the right item .
2	it was simple to order and delivery was very prompt
2	i will_definitely use them again
2	best value around for all the smellies i buy for the women in my life and always reliable and superfast delivery
2	i have already_recomended pet_supermarket to most of my friends in particular for their excellant pricing_structure , that they would find difficult to better the prices .
2	this is backed_up with an excellant delivery service that keeps you informed every_step of the way .
2	communication from the office reinforces all of the above services to make this certainly one of the best company '_s i have dealt_with .
2	when you get to our age its nice to get service you can depend on with friendly staff and prices that are realistic
2	as already_mentioned i have given them 0_stars
2	i '_ve been buying both original and copy printer_cartridges for my epson printers and have found them to be always very helpful and obliging .
2	their copy inks are first_class and on the one occasion when an ink failed to print returning it for a replacement was dead easy and no problem .
2	a first_rate company with superfast delivery and with the added_security of paying with paypal .... i have recommended to all our friends and family ... keep_up the good
2	super_fast delivery , however there was a manufacturing problem with the goods .
2	the team responded immidiately , i sent the damaged goods back and by return had a new unit
2	well_done , great service and communications
2	very happy with this service .
2	easy website , found what i wanted and much_cheaper_than handles0doors , and delivered ultra quick !
2	i am being asked to rate the company when i have only just ordered the product .
2	it says that delivery is 0 to 0_weeks which i think is unacceptable in this day and age , but it is a present for someone_else which they really want ; otherwise i would have found an_alternative .
2	the other thing is that the delivery starts at £ 0 + which for an item of £_00 + is virtually 00_% and makes the whole point of buying online pretty worthless .
2	with a diabetic_dog i need a reliable supplier of insulin .
2	i have been using viovet for just over a year and they have been faultless .
2	very easy ordering both online and by phone , excellent prescription handling , timely information and tracking .
2	products always arrive on time and less_than half the cost of buying from my vet .
2	highly_recommended .
2	i had to send a small but valuable item to the us .
2	the recipient recommended ups or fedex for security .
2	i got prices from them ranging_from £_00_-£_00 , no way was i paying that , so i went on line and found parcel_hero .
2	i paid them £_00 , it was picked_up the next_day by ' fedex ' and delivered in under 00_hours to arizona .
2	excellent quality goods , fare but not cheap prices , good well_packed delivery , i ’_m well pleased with them .
2	grumpy
2	very good produce
2	excellent service
2	fare price
2	i like ' em
2	my favourite and best news channel !
2	excellent and prompt service , i ’ d be happy to recommend them !
2	my wife and i have had a number of accounts for quite a few_years with the nationwide building_society .
2	in all that time they have always met our needs with no_problems .
2	does what it is supposed too !
2	i '_ve_used expedia for many_years for independant flights , hotels and car_hire .
2	they aren_'_t always the cheapest , you still have to shop around ; but they are the first site i use when starting a search so that i can benchmark others against them .
2	when i '_ve booked through expedia it has always worked , so_far i '_ve never had a problem so i can '_t comment on their performance when things go_wrong .
2	they are my ' most trusted ' of all the general travel websites .
2	brilliant flowers and can '_t fault anything on service , packing , condition etc .
2	love the result .
2	a 00 - page photo_album which really comes across like a hard backed book , which looks great and i am really happy with it .
2	the support line is great , which leads me on to a small_niggle , the fact that i needed to call the support line at all .
2	the provided software could be better , more intuitive and easier to swap photos around .
2	it can be done but its not easy , so photos get prominence that shouldn_'_t but switching them around is tricky .
2	however the printed result leaves standard photo_albums in the dust .
2	keep you memories in a fantastic book , its worth it .
2	got what i needed at a good price , on time and in excellent condition , can '_t fault anything .
2	thanks :)
2	from the initial email to the cheque arriving was only three_days
2	very fast & exxcelent service this is the third time i have used mazuma & it gets better every time
2	i bought a makita reciprocating_saw from them .
2	it was the best price i could_find by far and yet with excellent service & next_day delivery as well .
2	i have used them before and never had an issue .
2	i would happily_recommend them .
2	i ordered a shower bracket for a mira_shower which is now obsolete .
2	it arrived quickly and although i have not fitted it yet ( because it is for my mother in laws property ) it looks to be correct .
2	i checked reviews on the shower_doctor before ordering and they seemed good .
2	my experience only adds to that .
2	highly_recommend .
2	i booked a car via rentalcars for our holiday around the czech_republic and germany .
2	it was via a local company who are the agents for dollar & thrifty .
2	i booked for a vw_golf sized vehicle and was given a skoda rapid hatchback which is a larger car .
2	i had asked for a diesel but got a petrol .
2	however it turned_out to be only a 0 . 0 litre and surprisingly powerful yet returned almost 00 mpg ( uk ) on average despite driving through many mountains and the alps which was very impressive .
2	i will_definitely use again next time , in fact this is probably my 0th rental with this company .
2	started buying from gear0music when let_down by another company , wish i had found gear0music sooner .
2	service is excelent and gear is good price and seems to be original , no fakes .
2	returns service , should you need it is also brilliant .
2	well_done gear 0 music
2	i ordered a battery for my westfield kitcar via phone at 00 : 00 of an afternoon .
2	it arrived the next_morning and well_packaged - for me this is excellent customer service .
2	fantastic service
2	ordered 00 : 00 monday parcel arrived midday tuesday
2	i was having difficulties placing an order on - line , but i contacted parcel0go via the on - line chat and the staff_member that responded ( emma ) patiently took all of my order details and raised the order manually for me .
2	she listened to my problem and sorted things out quickly - many_thanks to emma !
2	i specifically booked same day delivery and the flowers were delivered the following_day .
2	when i complained i was told that ' same day ' delivery was within 00_hours ???!!!!!
2	how does that work ?
2	dreadful customer service .
2	i will never use this company again and will ensure i share my experience widely .
2	ordered a jacket late on sunday_night and it was delivered tuesday_morning .
2	great price , great communication and they use a great courier that gives to the delivery times down to the hour .
2	ordered from titmuss a number of times , prices always very competitive and delivery within 00_hours .
2	items well priced and received within 0 - 0 days .
2	excellent .
2	not the first time i '_ve_used toolstop and it definitely won_'_t be the last .
2	fast , reliable service every time and at a great price .
2	i ordered the wrong sink and i was able to refuse delivery on it and return it at no extra_cost .
2	the replacement new one was dispatched immediately and received the next_day .
2	would definitely recommend them .
2	i '_ve ordered form them a few_times and received the items promptly each time .
2	would have no_hesitation using them again in the future .
2	good website , excellent pre_- order support by phone and 0 :_00am next_day delivery from a lunchtime order .
2	unfortunately , one item wasn_'_t in stock and product substituted did not meet with my requirements , but a couple of phone_calls sorted this out .
2	my purchase was good value for money and i think there is a strong argument for buying from people who are prepared to fix problems and do what they say they will so i '_ll still give them 0_stars !
2	yet again a perfect experience from order to delivery
2	got an sms_message christmas night form parcel_force saying parcel would be delivered boxing_day and to ensure someone was at home to sign .
2	strange but maybe they have so many undelivered they are working extra .
2	delayed going out boxing_day until 0pm with no parcel .
2	rang today and guess_what , they have not received my parcel to depot yet , its due for delivery on 00th_dec , i '_m told its a glitch in the system by an extremely_helpful lady on the end of the phone ( thank_you ).
2	thanks parcelforce for a wasted day !!!
2	sort_out you systems
2	great design from_start to finish with great communication .
2	bought a set of pirelli p0 '_s which were £ 0 . 00 a tyre cheaper_than anywhere i could_find them in the uk and were delivered within 0 working_days of making the order .
2	actually i nearly missed the delivery as mid_morning dpd tracking was still showing them to be at the local_depot whilst they were actually out for delivery .
2	fortunately they arrived before i went out .
2	hardly tyreleaders fault though and their own communications on the status of the order could hardly be_bettered .
2	an excellent job guys , thanks
2	bought to go over prescription_glasses .
2	fit_perfectly , don_'_t wobble , and wrap around to exclude glare .
2	exactly_what i needed .
2	in the lead up to our fortnight '_s safari to tanzania and zanzibar in july , we certainly put yellow_zebra safaris ( yzs ) though the mill !
2	our dates changed after the first draft itinerary ; we then reversed the route when two nights at the recently opened little oliver '_s camp in tarangire suddenly_became_available , and julian managed to re - plan the itinerary entirely so that we could start out in the northern serengeti and end our safari at little oliver '_s .
2	all of these meanderings and changes of thought were dealt_with by julian of yzs with supreme good humour .
2	not only that , but he really got to know us and what kind of safari we were dreaming of , so that our trip was carefully tailored to our personal requirements .
2	this sense of personal service was really apparent when we discovered that , no matter_how early or late it was , yzs was always at the end of a telephone happily taking our calls , with julian and other members of the team cracking ( good ) jokes and working tirelessly to secure the accommodation and flights we were after .
2	it quickly became_clear that we were in the hands of someone_who knew africa intimately and could be trusted to give advice and offer suggestions that proved to be inspirational .
2	in the early stages when we were tentatively planning our trip , we had a number of other tour_operators bidding for our custom ; but yzs quickly stood_out as being exceptional .
2	in the event , all that planning paid off .
2	the accommodation - chosen to suit our desire not to be in large lodges and to experience the sights , sounds and smells of real africa - was , without_exception , superb .
2	the nasikia luxury mobile camp , located in july at the northern tip of the serengeti , placed us ( as yzs said it would ) in the ideal_location to see the huge migrating herds of zebra and wildebeest .
2	our guide and driver , nickson , seemed to know every blade of grass in the vast serengeti and the lush tarangire .
2	he could spot animals hidden in the bush , up trees or which appeared to us as just black dots on the horizon while effortlessly driving us along the bumpy dirt tracks .
2	had it not been for nickson , we would never have seen , let_alone got close to , one of the 00 or so black rhinos left in the serengeti .
2	our experience showed that the quality of one '_s guide can make or break a safari , or at the very least will have a major impact on what you see and what insights you gain .
2	julian had promised that yzs pride_themselves on securing the best guides , and that promise was fully_met in our case .
2	the ngorongoro crater proved to be heart - stoppingly beautiful .
2	as impressive as it is when viewed at 000m , it is only when you go right down onto the crater floor that its real beauty can be truly appreciated .
2	it is like having several eco systems all in one .
2	we moved from thick verdant woodland to open sun - dried planes to the shore of the green - blue alkaline lake in the space of a few hours .
2	the concentration and variety of the wildlife was remarkable .
2	our last four nights of a 00 - day trip were spent on a beach in matemwe , zanzibar .
2	none of us are really beach - holiday types , but this was a lovely place to unwind before returning home .
2	we stayed in the green and blue ocean lodge , a beautiful retreat situated on the soft white sands of matemwe beach .
2	we returned to london after the holiday of a lifetime .
2	and much of that was thanks to yzs .
2	as a company working in the motor sport industry we are always looking for more efficient ways to carry out our business .
2	we contacted the ramp_people and were immediately impressed as to the proactive way in which they worked - at their suggestion we changed the specification of our normal product and have ended_up at a solution both stronger and lighter and at a price where we could command a premium !
2	all orders so_far have delivered on time - despite the somewhat unrealistic time frames that we have to work to .
2	ordered a tenor ukulele in january_0000 and after many emails and phone_calls the delivery date has yet again been put back another month .
2	giggear state their suppliers have let them down , but there was no mention of zero stock or delayed delivery when the order was placed .
2	i have now cancelled the order and will look for another supplier .
2	as a regular_buyer through ao the delivery and service are veyond reproach .
2	on time , best price , and pleasant uk call team .
2	congratulations to all at ao .
2	i bought a second_hand bi_- metal datejust for my wife '_s birthday dec_0000 .
2	the traffic was terrible but rob kept the shop open untili i got there .
2	after looking at a great selection , i bought a 0000 model .
2	it was well_presented and rob added 0 additional links to make it fit .
2	these are good people to do_business with .
2	highly_recommended .
2	feel good have an easy to use website - ordering takes about 0 minutes or so .
2	the lenses arrived within 00_hours on standard despatch .
2	when i last checked , feel good where around 0 / 0 less expensive than the amazon lense sellers .
2	highly_recommended .
2	it is the first time i have booked a holiday without going through a main travel_agent , i was concerned of not being_able to discuss any_issues if i had any . i should have had no_worries whatsoever i had a couple of issues taking extra baggage losing transfer voucher on holiday on all issues a quick e_mail to alpha_rooms was answered with very very prompt simple reply . will not have any hesitation to re book for my next holiday and recommend to friends and family .

2	bought a curtain_rail for a 0000s semi bay_window .
2	it arrived within a couple of days and works_perfectly despite my best efforts - i bent the rails to fit the bay but bent them the wrong way around !
2	not an issue though as they were sturdy enough to be correctly re - bent and we now have a groovy slider for our heavy_duty curtain .
2	looks pretty good .
2	i am now a bay_window curtain_rail expert installer .
2	i would recommend these rails and poles and blinds .
2	top value and looks quality now i '_ve fitted then correctly !
2	wished i ' d read this site before agreeing to send my phone to these_people
2	mazuma turned my sale around ( for another phone ) in 0 days with cash in the bank - still_waiting on ( no ) cash0phones after 0_weeks ( so_far )
2	excellent turnaround - seemless
2	the lureshed sold me a closed face fishing reel by fladen .
2	the reel was blister packed by the manufacturer .
2	the reel was desribed as ideal for pike spinning .
2	the reel '_s construction was not good .
2	it broke before i could even use it .
2	the lureshed were very proffessional with thier customer_services and couldn_'_t have been nicer .
2	they took the reel back with no_qualms even_though the fault was with the manufacturer .
2	they refunded my money including the postage and gave_me a discount to cover the cost of postage of the faulty reel .
2	all within the space of a week .
2	ive delt_with other online companies before and this is the first i would reccommend even_though the product they sold me did ' nt work .
2	marks out of ten . eleven !!!
2	!
2	excellent service all_round , from_start ( ordering online , with a call within 0 minutes of clicking to confirm ) to finish - when tony turned_up to fit the 0 tyres to my daughters 000 .
2	no waiting in a cold area with no coffee .
2	wish i ' d used previously on a number of occasions .
2	fast and efficient service
2	checked internet for insulation most competitive price , delivery as_described would recommend without_reservation
2	i needed to arrange parking at bristol_airport .
2	i didn_'_t expect it to be an easy process , but it was very easy .
2	i think that the website was arranged so that it was easy to accomplish what i wanted without a lot of add - ons .
2	it was a very good system
2	[_name_] solved my issues promptly and accurately , just as i ' d have hoped .
2	when i first joined scottish_power it had really good customer service .
2	it is now appalling .
2	the senior_management are either stupid ., hard faced or have exceptionally low standards .
2	i received a letter regarding their increase in prices quoting their excellent customer service .
2	i have been on the phone a total of 00_hours and not had the opportunity to speak to a human .
2	i sent 0 emails asking for a refund and only after threatening_legal_action was my money refunded .
2	complete_shambles .
2	i am now an ex customer
2	not much to say just that it was an excellent service
2	the whole_process was very straightforward , there was an excellent range of hdmi_cables available .
2	i just selected the one that i wanted paid for it and then it arrived within a couple of days .
2	i now use it regularly to connect my laptop to my smart_tv .
2	it is of good quality , works_perfectly and is exactly as_described on the web_site .
2	i am happy to recommend this company to any potential_customers .
2	to summarise , easy ordering , speedy delivery , great products at great prices , what '_s not to like :-))
2	efficient service , good communication , what '_s not to like ?
2	i have been using viovet for about two years_now .
2	they supply me with both prescription and non prescription items for my two dogs .
2	i have always found them easy to deal with and things are usually delivered quickly and safely .
2	i have saved a lot of money particularly on the prescription_medicines that i buy .
2	after receiving our product i felt as though i received my monies worth and more thanks slr_hut .
2	i ordered this popular t shirt as a present at a very reasonable price .
2	it arrived 0 days_later in excellent condition .
2	great service as i was also notified of reciept of order then dispatch .
2	you can '_t ask for a better service .
2	eight loudspeakers ordered midday one day .
2	delivered mid_morning the next .
2	full communication at every process step of the order , and detailed , timed tracking of the delivery .
2	credit to dpd for that .
2	telephone queries dealt_with knowledgeably and well .
2	recommended wholeheartedly .
2	adding to my earlier review for everyone at sound_exposure , a second more recent order contained a mic that was dead on arrival .
2	without_fuss or bother a second was shipped quickly and , ( as previously ) immaculately packaged .
2	sound_exposure are a brilliant attentive concern who are supportive and efficient .
2	they ' re also quite a nice crowd to talk to .
2	wholeheartedly recommended .
2	this company is used by appliances direct , goodness_knows why .
2	a promised delivery on monday was cancelled because apparently the driver was taken ill .
2	this was a lie .
2	the delivery coincided with heavy school traffic and he obviously decided to move on .
2	after complaining to a . d .
2	i was told that the driver had exceeded his hours proving that it was a pack of lies .
2	next offer of delivery was wednesday which was no good for me .
2	i had to push for a thursday delivery even_though we were well past the failed monday .
2	no_indication of a time so had to wait in .
2	at 00 . 00 i was contacted to say they would be 00_minutes .
2	they turned_up and carried in a dishwasher .
2	i could see a part dangling from the bottom of the packaging .
2	put down in the kitchen i was asked if i wanted it unpacked for inspection .
2	as this is the procedure laid down by a . d .
2	i was surprised by the question .
2	of cause i wanted to inspect .
2	packaging removed it was obvious it was badly_damaged .
2	i suspect they were aware of this .
2	dreadful company .
2	un - contactable , even the tracking web_page collapsed , proven liars .
2	appliance direct lost the order as a direct result of arrowxl incompetence and lies .
2	if i could give the no stars i would .
2	despite a small problem where the initial order went_astray somehow , probably at the hands go royal_mail , this was quickly rectified and we couldn_'_t have been more pleased with the result .
2	very good cards , packed well and nicely_presented at a reasonable price .
2	always nice to have a more or less bespoke product , made to measure and at not too bad a price .
2	very nicely_finished , and works well .
2	delivered by the promised date .
2	recommended .
2	sofitel at gatwick_airport is an excellent hotel .
2	nice clean rooms , atmospheric public areas with lovely bars and retaurants .
2	above all the staff couldn_'_t be_faulted .
2	needed some winter_tyres for our motorhome .
2	tried several sites with tyres advertised but not in stock and no idea when they would be .
2	rang tyremen who had limited_availability on 0 vredstein 000 / 00 / 00 and much_cheaper then others .
2	ordered and delivered as promised today .
2	very helpful people on the phone .
2	would definitely use again .
2	i ordered my tyres on line saturday_morning , had an extremely nice and efficient chap_called rob phone me to confirm that my fitting would be sunday between 0 - 0pm .
2	adam turned_up at 0 . 00pm and was finished by 0 . 00pm .
2	what a very polite and friendly young_man , which nowadays is quite unusual .

2	thanks so much !
2	i '_ve been use ing ribble for ten_years , good choice of parts and cheaper_than local bike_shops who won_'_t give a discount of more than 00_%, !
2	its a no_brainer !
2	i generally order before 0pm and get my stuff in two_days !
2	order later and weekend delivery saturday ., there warranty is good and will replace faulty components , with out a big argument ensuring !.
2	refunds are quick , which have improved over the years .

2	its so cheap !
2	!
2	i had sent some wheels back then decided on another pair , paid the difference , and got them next_day , excellent service , 000_% better_than shinny bikes who took my money and lied about sending the wheels , but never did !
2	!

2	they got it to me from one end of the country to the other on time .
2	brilliant service .
2	this is the second purchase i make from drum - stop and i was fine .
2	i always recommend to everyone !
2	i live in italy ....
2	i would rather pay discounted prices , receive free stuff , and pay to get fast shipping than to pay large shipping prices plus retail with no samples to look_forward to .
2	supplement_warehouse lets you check out new products and get everything promptly with no mistakes .
2	industry leader by far !
2	transfer , accommodation and shooting range were all cool but our guide tried to take us to the most expensive bars so we did our own thing

2	they work just fine , and delivery was was fast and trouble_free .

2	the bulbs were well_packed and delivered on time and prices were good .
2	the reason companies like cloudbuy have become so popular is professional and polite service .

2	i will not_hesitate in recommending this company to friends and business_associates .
2	keep_up the good work and thank_you .
2	kindest_regards
2	jonathan hensman ( hensman consulting )
2	place order on website , pay , goods arrive sharpish .
2	simple really
2	pretty_much all said in the title .
2	swift and efficient service , at a good price .
2	i could not fault the whole_transaction .
2	we run an online business and were put into cardsave by a new developer who we were working with .
2	we thought this was because our developer was looking out for our interests but discovered afterwards that cardsave actively target developers and pay them nice commissions to put new customers their way .
2	what a disaster .
2	the cardsave integration with our site did not work resulting in anything up to 00_% of orders being lost because customers could not pay .
2	multiple hours on the phone to cardsave and our developer ( at £_00 per hour for our developer ), did nothing to improve things .
2	we had also had enough of our developer and so decided to find a competent one and just leave cardsave alone until we could move back to an_alternative supplier ( not allowed to mention who ).
2	between the lost orders , wasted time and extra development costs card save cost us something in the region of £_00 000 .
2	i told them this when they asked why i wanted to cancel .
2	i never got a single word of apology .
2	the new developer put the gateway from the alternative supplier ( not allowed to mention who ) live 0 days after our annual renewal date .
2	given our abysmal experience with them i would have expected them to be able to immediately cancel our account but this option was only available for a £_000 charge .
2	alternatively we could keep our account dormant for the next 00 months at a cost of £_000 .
2	in an attempt to keep our admin_costs down i even offered to pay the £_000 up front but any attempt to reason with them went out of the window and the only answer i managed to get out of anyone is " it is in our terms and conditions ".
2	they rattled this off in such parrot fashion that my guess is they must use this phrase many many_times per day .
2	as card save were clearly happy to maintain a dormant account for 00 months we decided to make it as costly for them as possible and cancelled the direct_debit and have been paying monthly by cheque .
2	in short , if you value your business , your_sanity and your cash , do not even think about working with cardsave .
2	ordered a 0m worktop on wednesday .
2	was delivered on friday .
2	speedy turnaround and great quality .
2	wanted delivered through a first floor window and would not around a tight corner at the top of the stairs .
2	the delivery team agreed to try although specifically against their terms of delivery .
2	thanks guys .
2	would not_hesitate to recommend .
2	as above .
2	no wasted words in giving support , it was straight to the point , a pleasant and personable service .
2	this plan is very easy to follow , great taste and never feel hungry .
2	lost a stone in 0_weeks so it does work .
2	very well priced as well .
2	i also got a speedy delivery .
2	ordered the bumper pack and split it over the two_weeks with my better half who also lost 0 pounds , so we are both delighted .
2	bought my sunglasses through sport and speed , their service was 0st_class .
2	reasonably_priced and a fast and reliable service .
2	communications was great and i would recommend them to anyone who_wants value for money .
2	lots of stock as well so all_round i am_delighted with my purchase and how my order was dealt_with .
2	waited in for 0 hours for a delivery that never came .
2	when i called they happily told me that it wouldn_'_t be coming .
2	they never apologised or offered any explanation why i hadn_'_t been told the delivery had been cancelled .
2	tried to reschedule a delivery a number of times .
2	each time i have been told that the delivery time that works for me is too far in advance for them to book it in .
2	sill haven_'_t been reimbursed for paying extra for next_day delivery that has happened .
2	really bad service .
2	excellent service , quick delivery , highly_recommended .
2	items in stock , well priced and quick delivery .
2	quality cables quality company ....
2	very happy with the quality of service ... delivery was quick ....
2	carl gosney

2	got 0 00inch tvs for gran kids ... they are happy so are we lol ...
2	my last 0 orders have not come when they should of ... one was next_day came 0 days_later & still_waiting on the other one ordered on 00 dec on free delivery ... still not come yet ...
2	got the phones i wanted & came before 0 next_day ...
2	i have nothing but praise for the folks at supplement_warehouse .
2	excellent products , huge_selection , super_fast shipping , and as always , great customer service .
2	bought the entertainment box which promises 0 months free use .
2	website forces you to input card_details and promptly charges for one month .
2	complaints to website for refund totally_useless , and a month later ( even with claiming free period ), no access .
2	somewhere someone is sitting in his mom '_s garage running this pathetic_excuse for an entertainment service .
2	just stay_away , and buy youself the google dongle .
2	cheaper in the end , and will save hours of frustration .
2	absolute crap .
2	when the water_tank in our dimplex fire developed a leak it was a scare to think how much it might cost to put it right !
2	a few_clicks later , replacement washers were on the way and were delivered a day later .
2	a few minutes of fiddling and the fire was as good as new - and all for less_than £_00 .
2	brilliant service !
2	couldn_'_t believe_how fast the software arrived , although a 0000 version a free update to 0000 was explained and easily_obtained through internet download .
2	excellent value for money and excellent customer service .
2	well_done wiziwoo !
2	i was more than pleased to find a supplier that was saving me £_00 on the camera deal i was searching for , but even better was in store .
2	the order was placed very late on friday_night and with the weekend looming i had reasoned that it would be the following friday before the goods arrived .
2	on monday i received an email to say that the order would arrive before 0pm the following_day , to be honest i didn_'_t take too much notice of the promise .
2	i should have taken notice because i was still in my pyjamas when it arrived the next_morning at 0am !
2	my scores are as follows :-
2	web_site , navigation and ordering - 00 out of 00
2	communication and feedback - 00 out 00
2	delivery and packaging - 00 out of 00
2	easily the smoothest and most efficient site i have ever purchased from and a site that i would recommend to anyone .
2	s . steele ,
2	leek , staffordshire .
2	a customer for several_years , i have never had any_problems - products arrive in a few_days properly packaged .
2	quality is superb and you can see the prices are generally no higher_than well_known stores
2	although a small annuity , the effort that went in to getting the best deal was amazing .
2	even having got what appeared to be a good deal , going off and double_checking and finding how i could get a better one .
2	kept_fully_informed .
2	everything done when they said it would be
2	size_guide is a brilliant idea - i normally buy xl but using the size_guide found i only needed an l which fits_perfectly
2	prompt service - great quality
2	one of ebuyers very first customers : excellent first_class business & domestic service .

2	no_problems .
2	oh don_'_t forget , to ensure the wall is safe , that there are no electrical wires , or gas pipes etc behind what you intend to drill for the holes .
2	safe / sturdy / reliable & effective .

2	i ordered a sealey valve spring compressor and air line adaptor sunday_night and it came on tuesday_morning , excellent service , there internet site is easy to use with good descriptions and pictures of the products they sell , i will use them again .
2	the pens i wanted were readily_available in the four colours i required .
2	they were at a keen price and i placed my order .
2	the pens arrived very quickly ( quicker_than_anticipated ).
2	great service .
2	i asked a question on their website and was amazed at how quickly it was answered ( virtually instantaneous ).
2	i ordered the part and was very impressed with the speed of delivery .
2	with excellent prices as well , they get top_marks .
2	i searched for the product i wanted using google and found tooled_- up . com had a very competitive price .
2	i therefire ordered the product from them and was kept_informed as the order progressed and was quoted a date and a delivery slot between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 .
2	the parcel arrived at 00 : 00 - probably the best and most accurate delivery i '_ve ever had .
2	the parcel was very well_packaged and the whole_experience could not be_faulted .
2	well_done to tooled_- up . com and their delivery agents for such superb service .
2	i found poles & blinds on the internet ( google ) as having the poles i wanted at very keen_prices .
2	prior to ordering , i telephoned for some advice on the wall_fixings and found the personnel extremely_helpful .
2	i then ordered two of the poles and was surprised to learn that they were to be delivered the next_day .
2	they arrived less_than 00_hours after_placing my order , well - packaged and in pristine_condition .
2	i had another query following the fitting of the two poles and this was answered with the same courtesy and efficiency as my original enquiry .
2	i would definitely recommend this company for its value for money , efficiency and courteous service .
2	first_class .
2	excellent response .
2	ordered on sunday_afternoon and even with super_saver delivery , i received the goods on wednesday_morning .
2	cost was also excellent and the website identified that i could also claim a free powerline adaptor from d - link !!
2	could not ask for better .
2	highly professional service with a fast delivery .
2	my 0 - year_old breitling montbrilliant arrived looking and performing like a brand_new watch .
2	have since discovered a small outlet at lakeside that shortened the bracelet in under an_hour and actually carries some watchfinder stock .
2	very useful .
2	just tried chemist_direct for the first time - it won_'_t be the last and i recommend anyone to try out the service .
2	good product range , great prices .
2	delivered exactly at the time when they said it would be .
2	very impressive these days , why can '_t more companies work this way ?
2	i really like boilerjuice .
2	it has information showing trending of the oil price helping you make informed decisions when to buy , and the quoting process is really simple .
2	enter a postcode and how much oil you need and you get prices options ( dependent on speed of delivery ).
2	simple !
2	i ordered a tux and paid for express next_day delivery , but at 0 . 00 pm the following_day it hadn_'_t arrived .
2	i called and explained the issue .
2	the agent agreed to look into the order and call me back which she did .
2	the order had become stuck in the system but they got the suit to me the following_day and refunded the delivery charge without_question .
2	the suit fitted well and was a good price , but more_importantly when things didn_'_t go well they treated me with empathy and were very efficient in dealing_with the issue .
2	i wanted an automatic watch that would not break the bank .
2	i spoke to tom_holland who , after listen to my wish_list , suggested a breitling superocean chrono .
2	i was sent a link to the watch and wanted it straight_away !
2	the watch arrived the next_day and looked like new ( i can not believe it is 0 years old !)
2	i would happily buy from watchfinder again and would not go_anywhere_else !
2	this service was first_class and would recommend it to anyone .
2	the boat was delivered on time , and the driver couldn_'_t have been more helpful and courtious than he was .
2	i will_certainly use them again , should the occassion arise
2	i bought a 0 saw veritas package online on wednesday , it arrived on thursday but once i ' d unpacked it i found one of the saw_blades had a bend in it - this could only have happened in the factory as the box was unopened before i opened it .
2	axminster immediately offered a replacement to be sent out but as i needed it right away they worked around that so that i could run into their high_wycombe branch this morning and exchange it there - all by 00am today and just over an_hour since i reported it .
2	great service from a customer_focused company .
2	i ordered a trend_router on special_offer and requested a saturday delivery ; it turned_up on time , wrapped up in layers of bubble_wrap to protect it .
2	i was kept_informed about the order all the way through .
2	will_definetly use them again .
2	*** have never switched before , and was somewhat_apprehensive_about the procedure .
2	however a phone_call to u switch put my mind at rest , and gave_me invaluable information that i was unaware of .
2	thanks to warren , the result is that we were made aware of an ideal fixed energy tariff for us as pensioners , and he will undertake the necessary switching procedures on our behalf .
2	warren was very friendly , informative and helpful , for which we are very grateful **
2	delivered within two_days despite weather , and packed superbly well !
2	!
2	would recommend without_hesitation !
2	!
2	what more can i say they delivered on their promise .
2	( they could have included some basic wiring instructions either with the product or online .)
2	great !!
2	fast delivery , good price - thank_you :-)
2	super service , fast delivery , a great compnay to deal with
2	having been given a delivery date , i waited in all day but my item never turned_up .
2	nobody had the decentcy to contact me to update me of the situation .
2	i did however get a phone_call at 0 . 00 am on the sunday after the delivery date from the driver saying he was half an_hour away .
2	he arrived but had no explanation as to why it was not delivered on the due date or to why i was not informed of any delay ..
2	however the customer service that followed was good , but was unable to give any reason for the delay
2	ordered on tuesday , delivered on wednesday .
2	installed and working great .
2	i will_definitely use mr_memory for my next memory_upgrade .
2	thank - you .
2	now that i have found this company i will_definitely use them again .
2	excellent service .
2	efficient , courteous and professional service .
2	i am_delighted with the purchase of my used tag_aquaracer ; it has_been refurbished to look like new and functions_perfectly .
2	i was very impressed with the way the company handled my purchase all the way from my initial_enquiry through to receipt of my watch 0 days_later .
2	the presentation of the watch in a new original tag box with manual was a nice_touch and made my experience with watchfinder a pleasurable_experience .
2	i will use watchfinder again and confidently_recommend them to others seeking a quality watch .
2	i am_delighted with the purchase of my used tag_aquaracer ; it has_been refurbished to look like and functions_perfectly .

2	good price , swift delivery and genuine asics shoes .
2	highly_recommended .
2	whilst the customer service of the company seems pretty good the course i followed ( social_media marketing for dummies ) was clearly created a long time ago .
2	most of the social_media interfaces have changed since the course was designed and several of the features have ceased completely ( eg there are chunky sections on linkedin answers and linkedin events both of which are no_longer supported ).
2	worse still , there is a whole module on gowalla which ceased_trading a year_ago .
2	the section on roi and analytics is less_than useful , and the test at the end seems a little bug ridden .
2	a shame because there is some good stuff in here and the style of presentation is engaging ( even if the sections are a little brief in some cases ).

2	great company great rates & no_hassle & excellent delivery
2	i have been using this company for many_years & never had any_problems

2	excellent service - item arrived_safely within two_days and communication from go - electrical was timely and correct .
2	even the courier arrived with 00min of the text notification !
2	highly_recommended .
2	ordered the goods , delivered quickly as promised and then , when we discovered we ' d inadvertently ordered wrong type they accepted them back at no additional_charge and dispatched the correct ones to our new address .
2	very impressed - and the prices were extremely competitive .
2	i have been ordering from supplementwarehouse . com for the past couple of years and made the mistake of shopping at another online supplement store .... once !
2	that mistake cost me about $_00 , but helped_me realize to never to shop anywhere_else than supplementwarehouse . com for my supplements .
2	the pricing is the best on the web and speed of shipping is second to none .
2	and you don_'_t even need to compare prices on the web because they do it for you !
2	easy shopping and great deals .
2	rock on supplementwarehouse . com
2	always a pleasure opening the door to the citylink driver , he brings the parcel to the door and if it '_s large will even help you bring it through the door , sign his pda and he leaves with a smile and a word goodbye .
2	brightens up your day , plus you have a new parcel to open !
2	love to use facebook , even have a page for my business where i can post updates and link back to my website .
2	check it out - ' the log_cabin ( barton )' - should help you find it .
2	then if you ' like ' it , you can ' like ' it !
2	photo loading is now much_easier than it used to be and i '_m getting used to the new ' timeline ' feature .
2	what more can i say ?
2	apart_from to add that you can also pre_- order cd '_s / dvd '_s that are not yet released and they ship them out as soon as they get them in .
2	great service , great packaging and recyclable too .
2	at_least martin does not talk too fast on the web_site !
2	but he still packs it with great money saving_tips on so many varied things .
2	well_worth a visit and sign up for the weekly email too .
2	i have always found amazon to charge a fair price for books and even when you use the supersaver free delivery option , they still arrive promptly .
2	they are well_protected in the packaging which is all recyclable and always seem to have the book i want to buy in stock .
2	i cannot_believe_how light the hungarian ultimate quilts are and yet they are so warm .
2	as a result you get a night of sleep without disturbances from being too hot , too cold or pressed into the bed by the weight .
2	the 0 . 0 tog feels much warmer yet feels_like there is nothing touching you it is so light .
2	nice products !
2	i used parcelforce a few_times recently on some ebay sales .
2	the pricing is competitive and the way you can track and trace the item sent is really useful for keeping the recipient informed .
2	drop_off at the local post_office is an easy way for despatch .
2	nice people to do_business with .
2	you know what to expect when you turn_up at a travelodge , rooms are all standard as are the beds , worth bringing your own pillow if you have neck problems .
2	the rooms are always warm and you have your own heating control .
2	great for a quick stopover on a budget .
2	ordered shirts , ties , suits etc all for our_wedding , everything was a brilliant fit and delivered really fast .
2	will use again for any formal_wear in the future .
2	wonderful heavy solid_oak_furniture from here , very well_wrapped and expertly delivered exactly when they said it would be .
2	even got interest free credit !
2	will be ordering more soon when we get the rest of the house sorted .
2	they are the best !
2	!
2	i do all my business_cards , pens , t shirts , leaflets and cards here .
2	nice previews of the final work and then you can choose how fast you want delivery .
2	screwfix is great for the diy or professional for a whole range of products .
2	you get prompt delivery or can even pop to your local_branch for pickup .
2	whenever i '_m stuck to remember an actor '_s name imdb comes to the rescue and lists off everything they have ever done .
2	what a great system !
2	hard to beat aldi on the price of anything , we get all our food from aldi and have always been happy with the quality over the whole range .
2	their weekly specials ( twice weekly actually ) are always brilliant and if they have something in short supply on special , it is worth getting up early and getting in the queue !
2	well whether it '_s the search_engine , the maps , or the sky maps , what can i say ?
2	google has it sorted !
2	bought some john_lewis own_brand roller suitcases here for our trip to new_york .
2	bought on line and had them delivered to the local waitrose free of charge , then popped down the road to get them .
2	how wonderful , no travelling , no delivery charge , no fighting through the store with other customers .
2	good quality strong and lightweight suitcases .
2	well_done jl !
2	i have used paypal for many_years to pay for items and it has always worked well .
2	i recently used it for some sales for which it performs well and the charges are fairly reasonable .
2	ebay , always check on ebay for whatever you are buying in case someone is selling it here cheaper .
2	have used ebay for many_years of purchasing and recently sold a few items as well .
2	a nice set_up .
2	tesco mobile , i use this with a phone originally from vodaphone and use tesco mobile as pay as you go .
2	top ups are easy with extra credit applied each_month , txt '_s and calls are a good price and reception is good unlike_some of the other_companies .
2	i needed a replacement central_heating_pump , and was searching around for the best price when mrcentralheating . co . uk cropped_up .
2	i had never_heard of them , but the reviews looked good , and i was only talking_about £_00 , so gave them a try .
2	well , i can_honestly_say the whole_experience was like a breath of fresh_air - it '_s how all on - line shops should_operate .
2	from the moment the order was accepted , i had several emails_keeping_me well informed about the staus and delivery ... and within a day ( and within the time_slot they had given me ), the goods duly_arrived .
2	i have no negative things to say at all - well recommended .
2	thanks ... david
2	i have been using zavvi for years - ever_since " the hut " group took over the name ( and before that too ).
2	i can_honestly_say that every time i order , i always get the goods ... and what '_s more , i have usually paid well below the going price anyway .
2	i mostly use them for dvd '_s and blu - ray , but i have bought kitchen stuff , games and pc parts ( disk drives ) in the past .
2	they often send discount_code which makes the prices even keener .
2	just recently , for instance , i bought ( and received within two_days ) a robert de niro blu - ray box set for just over eleven quid - can '_t be bad .
2	on the odd_occasion that i have had a faulty disc , they replaced it immediately , so no_problems on the customer_services front either .
2	even_though they are part of " the hut " group , sometimes the prices vary between the two , so it '_s worth_checking both .
2	certainly , they often beat the " other " big_name for pricing so they are always worth a look .
2	all in all , very happy ..... david
2	i visited wae_+ for the first time today .
2	i had done some price comparisons for a d - link usb_hub , and wae_+ kept coming up as one of the cheapest .
2	i had never_heard of them before , so was a little_wary .... but when i saw that they were also on topcashback ( though not quidco ?
2	), i was confident things were ok .
2	it was quick to register ( though you don_'_t have to ), and my order was completed very quickly .
2	in truth , i would like to see p_&_p inclusive prices , as sometimes they can really shock you at the end of an order - in my case they weren_'_t too bad .
2	also a bit disappointed i couldn_'_t pay by amex , even_though you are led to believe that amex is accepted ( probably is , but not through the credit_card payment_method ).
2	all in all though , a good experience , and a company i will_certainly use again ( providing the usb_hub actually turns_up of course ).
2	thanks .... david
2	update 00 / 00 /_0000 ...
2	still fairly happy with these_guys , but my order did take over two_weeks to arrive .
2	admittedly , they did give me an original delivery time of up to 00 days , but i think over two_weeks is pushing it a bit .. their prices are good , but they do need to get better on delivery times .
2	i am still leaving it at 0_stars because of the price and the fact that i did get an excellent d - link 0 port usb_hub .
2	have now used dapw for two orders and can_honestly_say they have been excellent in every_respect ... quality , communication , price and speed of delivery .
2	i am astounded at some of the negative_reviews here , as i have found them to be top_drawer .
2	perhaps there were some issues at the time , but dapw certainly seem to have ironed that all out .
2	keep_up the good work .
2	i have used shiply twice_now and both have been smooth , swift and reasonably_priced .
2	thanks
2	found the service to be excellent fr a great price and prompt delivery .
2	thanks
2	saw the item on line and rang to do the deal .
2	very helpful people and fast delivery .
2	would use again .
2	thanks .
2	apporached golf_support having found a better deal but asked them to beat the price by 00_% and include offers .
2	they not only did that they also allowed_me to customise the clubs .
2	i was kept_informed regarding progress of the order and duly_arrived on the minute they stated !
2	!
2	the clubs are great and i will use them again for my golf_equipment in future .
2	thanks again .
2	very prompt service and great price .
2	will use again .
2	thanks
2	i am very happy with the service provided .
2	i sent my phone in and received an email the next_day confirming it had been received and payment pending .
2	the payment was in my account a day later .
2	0 days to send phone and receive payment .
2	very pleased .
2	i found pet_supermarket after a search online of different suppliers and thought i would try them .
2	their prices seemed very good , in fact so much so that i thought it was too good to be true and that it was some sort of scam .
2	how wrong i was !
2	my delivery arrived earlier_than_expected which was a pleasant_surprise with no_problems_whatsoever .
2	i would highly_recommend them as their prices , service and delivery are exceptional .
2	now i have placed and received several orders for pet_food from them as i know i am going to get good value for money .
2	im very pleased i found them online and would recommend them to others .
2	i ordered my laptop on monday_night and i received it wednesday_afternoon .
2	i never expected to receive it quite so quickly as delivery was 0 days and it was posted out on tuesday .
2	i am very pleased and will_definitely be recommending you to others .
2	not only were your prices the best i could_find but your delivery , communication and service is excellent .
2	many_thanks .
2	communication was excellent .
2	the camera was not in stock the day i ordered ( a friday ) but i was immediately notified and asked if i wanted to look at an_alternative .
2	i declined as i wasn_'_t in a major hurry .
2	on the following_monday i was emailed and informed my camera was in and was being shipped .
2	i asked them to delay the shipment until thursday so that someone would be in to receive it on the friday .
2	this was no problem to them and it duly_arrived as arranged .
2	on top of that the value was great .
2	highly_recommended , great service
2	wheelspin offered the best price , and delivered in 0 days using very reasonably_priced standard postage .
2	the website was very clear and easy to locate the products needed .
2	the service was top_class
2	was a little_suspicious that the fitted price was as good as suggested .
2	confirmed with a main_dealer and small garage that they couldn_'_t get anywhere_near the price - advised it was a great deal .
2	the garage selected were top_notch too .
2	may be worth_checking the garage selected to fit - otherwise a fab service .
2	high_quality upholstered chair approx_£_00 cheaper_than amazon ( including £ 0 - 00 delivery ) and delivered next_day although it said 0 - 0 days for furniture whats not to like ?
2	fast next_day service if ordered before 0pm and only £ 0 . 00 record well_packaged and protected .
2	can '_t beat it with a stick !!!!
2	will use again
2	totally_trustworthy and sort things out when there are problems

2	no catches , just free monies !
2	highly_recommended .
2	never ordered from them before .
2	but prices were good , delivery was really fast & the overall service was very impressive .
2	i will be using them again in the future .
2	no_problems_whatsoever with my order from cancom .
2	they said it would be with me next_day , & it was .
2	they were the cheapest in the uk , had an easy payment system & an easy to use website .
2	how could i give anything but 0_stars ?
2	00 are the best mobile_network i have ever_dealt_with , i never had to contact them in the 0 years i was with them & only moved company because i got a better deal .
2	moving to vodafone was a big_mistake , they are pretty_useless , never answer the phone , & rude & always seem to magically over charge me every_month .
2	i '_ll be going back to 00 once my contract is renewed .
2	i '_m sorry 00 !
2	i dealt_with easyishop a few_months back , when i ordered 0 cases for my nieces ' birthdays , after 00 - 00 emails , they just stalled me again & again .
2	so i did a bit of sleuthing around in my spare time & found that they were in the same building as another company - tempo web design .
2	so i found their phone number , gave them a call & finally got through to easyishop .
2	i will say that the guy at the web design company was very nice & i got passed straight through to easyishop & finally got my refund .
2	i would say , without a doubt , this is the worst experience with an internet retailer i have ever had & i '_m really not over exaggerating .
2	i used to work for ticketmaster & i thought they were bad , but easyishop really do take the gold_medal !
2	steer_well clear of ever placing an order & if you did & your really at your wits_end , then give tempo web design a call & hope they are still in the same building .
2	as above , thanks sam for a fast & efficient service today ....
2	very helpful staff , courteous and friendly .
2	main plus point was they came up with a good price for my insurance needs
2	very user - friendly website , with some great offers - looks_like there '_s a regular stream of offers , so need to keep looking ( have signed_up to e_- mail , so hopefully i '_ll get to know ).
2	have used exclusively for steam pc download activation codes , so can '_t comment on other aspects of their service , but i '_ve not encountered any_problems .
2	great to get credits when buying something - i '_ve had a couple of £ 0 credits , which i '_ve_used on further_purchases , so even cheaper games !!
2	!
2	i was very happy with the service , quick delivery and packaging .
2	the product is a brace to help my tennis_elbow ,
2	i am wearing it now and it seems to be working very well .

2	active sports had in stock the brake_pads i needed for my mountain_bike .
2	tried many other_companies , but only active sports were able to supply them .
2	first_class service a great company to deal with .
2	the item delivered was a good spec and easy to fit .
2	i ' d previously been let_down on purchasing this product by another supplier which took the order without actually having it in stock despite information to the contrary so i had to get a refund .
2	however , trueshopping gave the best price i ' d seen and actually provided the product as stated on the delivery information and it was useful to have the mail tracker .
2	well_done trueshopping , i will go to you first when shopping online in future .
2	i '_ve tried various sheepskin_slippers from other_companies in the past but found them failing after 0 months or so and the last pair had sheepskin soles which soon wore through .
2	these have synthetic soles with a sound grip so i can nip outside when it '_s wet underfoot and not get damp soles of my feet .

2	sent back using buyaparcels courier collection , waited another week while the incorrect unit was checked before the correct item was dispatched .

2	i started out with one of arbico '_s basic model and then tweaked it to my own requirements .
2	the price came in under that i ' d found on other_sites for a very similar spec .
2	within a day or so of placing the order , i received a mail pointing_out a couple of problems with the tweaks i ' d made and included upgrades to the spec as well as some other useful upgrades i hadn_'_t considered .
2	i was kept_informed by mail of the progress of my machine and arbico were kind enough to rearrange delivery for me , as i wasn_'_t available on their original date .
2	the pc arrived on the day promised , well_packed and all i had to do was plug it in and switch it on .
2	all in all , an excellent service and i have already_recommended arbico to a friend .
2	ordered a first canvas_print as a trial , then ordered two more as was impressed by the service .
2	the canon_00d was my second major purchase from digitalrev and just like the first purchase they did not disappoint .

2	to be recommended !
2	it was only a small order , but it was dealt_with efficiently and i was kept posted all the time .
2	placed an order on 00th_december to be delivered to two elderly ladies in australia on 00st_december costing me over £_000 .
2	they were delivered on 00th_december ( why did they ask me for a delivery date then ?)
2	and they were dead by the 00st .
2	i have used other_companies to deliver flowers to australia and usually get about 0 - 00 days life out of the flowers - 0 days at £_00 each is ridiculous .
2	there online customer_services refuse to help as i don_'_t have photographic_evidence of the flowers which i cannot get .
2	as one of the deliveries was to my mother - i don_'_t think she would lie about something like this .
2	don_'_t use this company - go somewhere_else .
2	from reserving online to having items delivered - no_complaints .
2	excellent easy to use site as well .
2	have had some great advice from this site for saving money .
2	swell worth_checking out regularly .

2	i thought all these online unlock sites were just a rip_off , i was really surprised when this one worked , as soon as i clicked to buy i thought , " i '_ve made a mistake here , maybe my phone will shut_down for good ".
2	the unlock worked_perfectly , i picked the right company , because there are bogus ones out there , this one works .
2	i was frustrated at having an iphone locked to 00 , not any longer , its flying .
2	ordered a strap exstention that was in stock when i placed my order .
2	only to be told via e_mail that it was out of stock and i would now have to wait 0_weeks .
2	not good but i hope things will get better .

2	i have used mpb_photographic several_times over the past couple of years .
2	i have bought from them , sold to them and used the part exchange service .
2	every time , i have received very good quality second_hand equipment at realistic prices and have received fair value for anything sold to them .
2	my present nikon_d000 was bought from them and is as new , giving great pictures coupled_with some quality professional lenses from mpb .
2	i am picky regarding service as my background is as a customer service manager with a multinational business .
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending them and i have no doubt i will use them in the future .
2	i have used park_cameras on and off for some years .
2	whilst not immediately local to me , their stock and expertise has led me to visit them for new , used and part exchange .
2	i have also attended an olympus open day in the past .
2	my latest experience was for sensor cleaning supplies ( i clean my own sensor ), which was well priced ( compared to the competition ) and promptly dispatched .
2	i am happy to recommend park_cameras without_reservation , based on my personal experiences .
2	contacted mazuma on the net , placed my order , got sent the free pay envelope , sent off my phone , got my cheque .
2	it was that easy !
2	if you have a phone to sell use mazuma .
2	it was easy to use the website , set_up an account , and find somebody to collect / deliver goods .
2	like ebay , shiply uses a feedback system and on the strength of this i was able to kick the first two quotes into touch and accept the third .
2	it is refreshing to have costs broken down & know what shiply is getting and what the courier will charge .
2	although i have yet to see the product ( my father collected it for me and i see him for the first time since the purchase this weekend ) i don_'_t expect any_issues as it is a matabi sprayer which are meant to be pretty good .
2	the retailer was very helpful , allowing collection by transferring the product to their_offices in folkestone where it was convenient for my father to collect it .
2	a vat_receipt was emailed to me promptly .
2	i have no_complaints whatsoever and would_gladly purchase from ffx_tools again .
2	i have used printerbasics for some time now for printer_ink_cartridges and have had no reason at all for complaint .
2	i did buy a comparable cartridge from a local shop in an_emergency recently but bought five from printerbasics for only £ 0 . 00 extra , well_worth the extra couple of days for them to arrive in the post .
2	you have my full recommendation to any one considering using your company .
2	my first purchase from them was good - no_problems ; however , they must have been softening me up for the second purchase .
2	i ordered a view finder from them 00 days ago which was showing as " in stock ".
2	the payment was taken but i am still_waiting for the item despite several e_- mails to them and ( false ) promises of an expedited delivery .
2	the item still shows as 0 in stock , but my order still shows as " new " !
2	i would warn any potential customer to be very careful - pay a bit more and use a more reliable company .
2	excellent on time delivery .
2	the team at 0wm gave superb support to resolve a couple of hiccups and could not have done more .
2	the denver dvh - 0000 which i got is a superb machine playing multi region_dvd '_s , mp0 dvd '_s and cd '_s , and also plays music and shows pictures via a usb_port and card slot , as well as supporting hd playback via an hdmi connector .
2	what more could anybody want ?... perfect
2	quick response , would use again without_hesitation .
2	we did exactly_what they say in the tv_ad .
2	we shopped_around , visited some showrooms and decided what we wanted .
2	then we went to victoria_plumb and saved a load of money .
2	our entire order ( shower , rail and nice big multi - function shower_head ) including delivery was less money than the shower was in most of the other_places we visited .
2	the website was great , ordering was easy and they delivered exactly when we asked .
2	we would recommend them without_hesitation to anyone .
2	i used_etyres for 0 new tyres on my 0x0 .
2	they were cheapest for the type of tyre i wanted and , even better_than that , they came to my house and fitted them .
2	what more could you ask for ?
2	i '_ll definitely use them next time too .
2	thank_you for a wonderful service .
2	my brother - in - law recommended you saying that the product he purchased from you arrived next_day at 0 . 00am

2	excellent service .
2	quick delivery and great prices
2	takes the pain and disappointment out of online shopping ... best place to share your views , good and bad ... and check out retailers before you order
2	great service although worth_checking stock over the phone , usually dispatch same day to arrive next_day ..
2	there was a time when chain_reaction delivered next_day , £_000 worth of in stock items ordered on monday & tuesday , i get an emails estimating same day dispatch .. called them on wednesday and offered to pay more for delivery but i was informed they had been dispatched .. now i discover that they were not shipped until thursday_night via a 00 hour service that don_'_t deliver on saturdays ..
2	prices are competitive but don_'_t rely_on them if you need anything urgent .
2	great prices and super service
2	great service and fast dispatch

2	we were looking to release some equity from our property and contacted age_partnership .
2	right from the outset we found them to be very friendly and knowlegeable , answering all my questions promptly and efficiantely . we obtained our equity in a matter of weeks and could not be_happier with the result .
2	i bought tyre from tyreleader fast delivery at my door in 0 days from france .
2	and they recommended all the garages near me that fitted and how much , thought great either deliver to garage or to home i chose home , just as well as i live in glasgow largest city in scotland , and not one of the garages i called fitted motorcycle tyres or even had herd of them .
2	i said to garage do you know you are recommended on tyreleaders web_site .?
2	not one had even herd of them , glasgow is in the central belt of glasgow but no i had to call the usual_suspects victor divine , mickey oates , ride on , when called ducati great western road glasgow wanted me to wait a week , and all priced between £_00 and £_00 depending if wheel was on or off bike these_guys are bad enough with there over pricing , and should be_ashamed they want you to buy tyre from them .
2	so they have the monopoly on it , but sorry guys the internets here .
2	so yes tyreleader , great if you have tyre leavers .
2	in garage , but failing that what you save in price you lose on having it fitted .
2	so my advice phone the garages near you to see if they fit motorcycle tyres and how much , when i asked victor divine honda glasgow .
2	how long it took he replied 00_minutes , me and my mate took wheel of with trolly , jack in garage in dark in 0 minutes shame on you victor divine and all the other suspects in glasgow you know who you are , i will never cross any of there doors again .
2	ps tyreleader asked for garages in glasgow and would investigate .
2	done nothing no explanation just an_apology .
2	i have been using this company for approx 0year now and the company was recommended to me which was why i tried them originally .
2	the company always deliver what they offer and have not had one problem since i started_using them . the staff ate always polite and helpful for any query i have had .
2	keep it up !!
2	!
2	ive been with them for ten_years .
2	had the occasional problem but they ' re always ready to help .
2	the member centre on the web_site is excellent and there is plenty of good advice for users .
2	kep it up guys , don_'_t let your growth interfere with your service !
2	it was easy to find my phone and get a quote .
2	the price offered was good .
2	sending the phone was straightforward - i chose to pay for signed for delivery but could have use the freepost_label if it had been a less expensive phone .
2	i had a couple of other phones which were worth nothing .
2	it would have been nice to get a couple of quid to send them for recycling along with the good one !
2	overall , ten out of ten .
2	thanks guys !
2	total buying experience .
2	good communication and super_fast delivery .
2	would highy recommend .
2	the post bag came on time as did the cheque , all correspondence recieved to notify progress was exellent and done when it was suppose to be , exellent all_round performance .
2	i would have no_hesitation in recomending your company & service
2	old grand - dad is still one of my favourite bourbons , smooth with that very special bourbon aroma .
2	it has_been many_years since i bought a bottle and now along with many of the other traditional bourbons , i will be making up for lost time !
2	thank_you , whisky_exchange for your excellent and professional service . cheers #
2	my family have bought three_separate items from digitalrev and based on our experience would recommend this company to anyone .
2	why :-
2	* greta products
2	* brilliant prices
2	* fast delivery
2	* you are kept_informed every_step of the way by their own and dhl '_s tracking systems .
2	i used double0tickets . com for the first time this week to buy carrie underwood tickets at the royal_albert_hall .
2	the website was clearly set out and the seating arrangements clearly described and the savings against the face value ticket prices was excellent .
2	the booking and confirmation service was straightforward and reassuring and the tickets were delivered to my home address next_morning .
2	what an excellent and quality service and i will_continue using it !
2	from the moment i started researching the market for remote_control trolleys the protrolley website & gt000r stood_out as being very professional and a high_spec value for money cart .
2	my email & phone correspondence was answered_promptly and clearly and having ordered the trolley was delivered within 0 days and as soon as i opened the package my expectations were exceeded .
2	on the golf course the trolley and i have experienced the most atrocious_weather_conditions from waterlogged & muddy courses to hard frost , snow & ice and the gt000r trolley has performed_brilliantly .
2	one practical tip is when the driving wheels get really muddy i simply slide them off put them in a bin liner and rinse them off at home rather_than make the carry_bag or boot of my car dirty .
2	the gt000r remote_control trolley has certainly enhanced my golfing experience but it hasn_'_t improved my handicap yet !
2	easy to navigate web_site , great deals from various ferry_companies , safe and secure payment options ( but most have a surcharge ) ideal for what i need .
2	i bought a 0 . 0 speaker_system .
2	following my purchase i had several e_- mails_keeping_me informed of the progress of the purchase order and dispatch .
2	after a couple of days it was delivered .
2	the functions of the unit are admireable .
2	i was a little scepticle of the 00_watt speakers , but their performance is supurb with no distortion at full volume ...
2	the speaker cases and unit have a high_gloss_finish and look very swish ( i know it '_s a dated expression !).
2	the only_criticism i have is that the speaker wires would look better with ' clear coating ' instead of the standard black .
2	easy to use remote_control and very straight_forward to assemble / wire up .
2	the remote also controls my mp0_player whilst plugged_into the usb_port of the unit .
2	in summary a very nice unit at a very good price .
2	items ordered were dispatched on time and delivered next_day , advised all the way about what was happening with order .
2	as i have many pairs of ecco_shoes i had no fears ordering over the internet , these shoes were in the sale so were an excellent price , they arrived undamaged and very quickly
2	found slrhut online and took some time to decide to purchase online but the price difference from the high_street was too tempting .
2	after_placing my order for a tamron 00 - 000 lens which by the way is a fantastic lens for the money , i received an email asking me to contact then for confirmation of order which i thought was a bit odd but phoned and spoke to what i thought was a add on sales_pitch but ended_up being a very polite efficient discussion which ended with a half price deal on some filters , i have checked the prices of these filters online and the discount is genuine .
2	i didn_'_t realise at first my purchase was coming from america but was surprised at the speed of delivery , 0 days , i cant speak highly_enough of my first experience of slrhut and will recommend them .
2	the site looks professional and mentions no charges for a listing .
2	on the second page the tick_box automatically defaults to £_000 for standard listing ( this website does not come up in any google_search ) they send a paypal invoice for £_000 0 days_later demanding you pay for a service that does nothing - beware
2	found a great deal on a mirror , long lead time 0_weeks for delivery .
2	estimated delivery date came and went no sign of the mirror , couldn_'_t contact achica by telephone only email , which is against the law not to have a telephone line on an internet company .
2	after 0 days they reply to emails_telling_me they would look into it , 0 days more i got tracking_details .
2	the parcel sent by xdp has the wrong depot marked on the shipment so its been going back and forth_between the two branches with no hope of ever getting to me - i have asked achica to get this sorted 0 times now , but replies take 0 days each time .
2	before you part with your cash have a good long think about using this company .
2	i decided to book a hotel through lastminute . com .
2	when i searched the hotels list i found there seemed to be a good deal to be had by booking a so called " secret hotel ".
2	its advertised as a 0 or 0 * hotel offering up to 00_%_off .
2	sounds good so_far doesnt it .
2	the only thing you cant see if the hotel name so you cant research it at all before you go .
2	i booked one of these hotels on a room only basis , breakfast was not an option , only to find once i received my confirmation booking that i could have booked the hotel cheaper by booking direct and i would have been given breakfast .
2	i made an enquiry with lastminute . com only to be told that as it was a promotional price on the hotel website they wouldnt do anything to change my booking .
2	now imagine how i felt being told up to 00_%_off a 0 or 0 * hotel and the fact you are taking a chance as you dont_know the hotel you are going to and then to find i was paying more for it .
2	not impressed and will not be using this facility again .
2	beware of this nice little scam
2	delivery arrived quickly with email progress notification
2	very happy with a quick and efficient delivery service .. 0 year_guarantee and useful extras .. all at the best price too ...
2	staff we ' re extremely_helpful and offered great advice when i was buying an over locking machine for my daughter .

2	really helpful on the phone and good advoce .
2	purchase very smooth .
2	really helpful telephone advice on choice of appliances and great customer service on advising of delivery .
2	delivered and unpacked at our house and they even offered to remove the packaging for us .
2	highly_recommended .
2	helpful advice - items in stock - shipped as promised .
2	what more could anyone want ?
2	top auswahl und ansprechendes preis / leistungsverhältnis .
2	lieferung meistens innert 00 std .
2	super kundendienst .
2	great selection , great service , fair price , fast and flawless delivery ...
2	close to perfect ...
2	lightbulbs_direct cover a very wide and comprehensive_range of light_bulbs .
2	they always seem to have the bulb i want and dispatched very quickly .
2	a good service .
2	i have used viovet for a few_years_now and have no_complaints .
2	they stock the different hills_dog_food our two labradors require and they update us as to when we can expect delivery .
2	a company founded on customer_care .
2	the sales staff were very helpful and patient as i was trying to replace 0 radiators which because of the imperial sizes were not always easy to find the exact metric equivalents .
2	this company offers old_fashioned qulaity of service and is a friendly business to deal with .
2	the radiators turned_up ahead of time and are fitted .
2	i have no_reservations and would use the company again .
2	goods were first_rate and delivered quicker_than stated .
2	there was a return_label which meant goods could be returned at no cost to me for any reason .
2	bought a pair of shoes in their well stocked and friendly store , unfortunately there was a problem with the sole bonding .
2	slane could not have done any more .
2	organised a replacement pair for me and sent over to my home in scotland in less_than 00_hours of getting them from italy for me .
2	i purchased a 0 port network switch to improve my home entertainment streaming setup . i received it two_days after i ordered the item , and have to say it took only a minute to set_up and works_perfectly .
2	this is the second time i have used your company and will_certainly recommend you to friends and family . many_thanks ... alan barnett
2	i have purchased from a large number of world and uk e_- cig companies but have now narrowed my list down to just a few ... safercigs is one of them !
2	their product range is superb and delivery time for orders is excellent .
2	i will be using them regularly .
2	ivan flack aka midimanni ( cookstown , n . ireland )
2	the items were ordered in the afternoon and delivered early the next_day .
2	as they were required urgently this was fantastic service .
2	the order was placed by telephone and the response was helpful and polite .
2	a great experience - i will recommend this company to other_businesses and friends and will use them again !
2	first off let_me say that i have always thought that talktalk have some good ideas and services but they really can let themselves down .
2	firstly calling to offer additional boosts to save call costs when the boost would cost more than my total call costs !
2	the real bugbear though is when you have a problem with the line , all starts off well and i can_imagine that if they get it sorted first time the process would be pretty slick , the difficulties arise when the problem does not get fixed first time around .
2	their insistence on going back over the same process from the start each and every time is infuriating , why not pick_up from where you have got to !
2	then comes the matter of the text_messages to which you can either only reply with a yes or a no , or even worse when you cannot reply at all .
2	i had 0 texts in 0 days that were no reply type messages_telling my problem was being worked on when i had already had the problem sorted_out .
2	talk about a waste of time !
2	there is more but i do not want this to turn in to a rant .
2	they need to get their problem handling system sorted_out .
2	having purchased a replacement battery for my canon_eos 0d at the beginning of last_year .
2	i can report still charging and functioning fine , a far cheaper price than canons .
2	i have recently_bought a replacement battery for a bosh drill .
2	works_fine and yet again cheaper_than the manufacturers version .
2	prompt deliver on both_occasions .
2	my canon 00 - 000 arrived in days of ordering .
2	my new sigma 00mm took a few weeks , but well_worth the wait .
2	i needed to get a document to washington , usa .
2	i live very close to heathrow .
2	i mention this because given the collection and destination addresses , i thought it would give the courier a good chance to deliver my letter on time .
2	as royal_mail couldn_'_t do a next_day service to usa , they directed me to the parcelforce web_site .
2	this clearly_states that documents to the usa are ' from next working day '.
2	i took this to mean that they had a range of delivery times , the quickest of which was next working day .
2	it certainly appears that way .
2	just to be on the safe side , i called them on 00 june and placed the order for their global express service over the phone .
2	i asked the person if it would be delivered in one day and , after checking my postcode and the delivery postcode , he confirmed that it would .
2	he told me they would collect the document on 0 july between_0am and 0 :_00pm and it would be delivered on 0 july .
2	sure_enough , they collected it at 0 :_00pm on 0 july .
2	when i checked their website around 0pm on 0 july , it still only showed that the document had been collected .
2	i was expecting it to say something like ' in transit ' but didn_'_t think much more about it .
2	on 0 july at about 0pm , i checked the website again and it still had no updates .
2	not a good sign i thought .
2	so , i sent a tweet .
2	' sarah ' responded after 00min to ask if i was the sender or receiver , i couldn_'_t see the relevance of this but tweeted back accordingly anyway
2	after another 00min , ' jonny ' responded to say that it was down for delivery on 0 july .
2	i requested an explanation but none was forthcoming .
2	time to pick_up the phone .
2	after several phone_calls , it transpires that they were planning to deliver on 0 july all along even_though they told me on the phone that it would be 0 july .
2	i got very upset and they apologised but still tried to make out that it should have been 0 july all along .
2	i explained that i have a very simple philosophy about service .
2	say what you are going to do and then do it .
2	parcelforce failed .
2	i have put in a claim for a refund but i wouldn_'_t be surprised if they try to use the ' we said 0 july ' as an excuse .
2	fortunately , because i did it over the phone , there will , in all likelihood be a recording of the conversation where they told me 0 july delivery date so there will be proof .
2	i will update this review when i know the outcome .
2	judging_by the number of negative_reviews on this website , this is not an_isolated experience .
2	overall , if you are thinking of using parcelforce and the delivery timing is important then i would recommend going to different company .
2	update 0 .
2	00 july_0000 .
2	more than a week has passed and parcelforce are still prevaricating over the claim .
2	responses to messages take on average 00_hours and then , it is only a response .
2	no real new information is provided .
2	i can see this one ending up in the small_claims court .
2	if only i had checked trustpilot before using them ... what i don_'_t understand is why they are only in 00th place out of 00 and not 00 .
2	that suggests there is someone even worse than them , something i would not have thought possible .
2	i have just switched energy_supplier again ( which now seems to be as much an annual tradition as christmas ).
2	i think perhaps i am now a ' rate tart ' but what else can you do ?
2	it is the second time i have used uswitch ( online ) to do this and i am still very impressed .
2	there is no mandatory login or anything like that , they just do it with the minimum of fuss and effort .
2	i think the only information i had to provide this time was my name , address and bank details for the new energy_supplier .
2	perhaps i should say ' simples ' but i think that is someone_else
2	ordered the goods early in the morning .
2	they were despatched that day & delivered 0 days_later .
2	the prices were competitive and the delivery cost was lower_than many other_sites .
2	overall i am quite satisfied with every_aspect of the transaction
2	the email from simply_electronics acknowledging my order and a subsequent email_advising about delivery were poorly formatted and difficult to decipher .
2	they gave a poor impression of the company .
2	the packaging of the camera was inadequate and the corner of the camera box was damaged .
2	the receipt came from google_checkout not simply_electronics .
2	simply_electronics would help themselves if they adopted systems and packaging of a similar standard as amazon .
2	the delivery came in 0 days [ which incuded two public_holidays ].
2	they have a comprehensive_range of pumps and all at very competitive_prices .
2	their website is easy to navigate , with all the information you may need about the different products .
2	their delivery is faster_than they promise , which i think is a sensible way to approach this issue , as couriers are outside of their control .
2	all in all a pleasant_experience .
2	thanks
2	can not fault products or price , have used twice_now always speedy delivery
2	had problem with left eye , told to have new lens fitted , paid £_00 when i got it back , was still the same , when i went into shop told they had put a differant varifocal_lens in they said they would recheck my eyes , they then told me they could not improve my left eye , they would refit my old lens for me , they are nothing but money grabbers , have booked to see a proper optician , shall never use specsavers again
2	have just spent over forty min talking to india call_center , reported a fault open_reach fixed by removing line , never said they had removed line only found out when tried to use phone , bt said they have removed line and taken it to be checked then they would bring it back , have you ever heard any thing like it , will be with out phone for five days , indian_call_center had no idea , this is one customer going to virgin , bt must be one if not the worst company going , if you have a life line dont bank on bt for your service .
2	this company must be cheap , the only reason any one uses them had a washer deliverd by them arrived damaged , pointed_out damage to delivery driver he said you can unpack it and use it .
2	had to order a new one to replace it , could get new one but could not get damaged one collected same day so have to find room for two washers . have to say the after service was better_than the delivery , and they went out of there way to sort my problem , nisha made sure my replacment washer and the damaged one were swopped on the same day , thank_you for that .
2	this company does not provide a customer service , they just fob you offf never reply to emails , phone them is a waste of time
2	orderd from sports_direct but wrong adress put on parcel , sports_direct rang yodel to get it changed , i rang yodel three_times last time on the morning of delivery and was told they had heard from sports_direct and the adress had been changed , next im told parcel had been deliverd to wrong adress , the lincoln center never botherd changing the adress , was only delivery driver who went out of his way to correct the problem , and went the extra_mile to get me the parcel , many_thanks to him .
2	great item as good as brand_new , at a great price
2	just heard npowers moving call_centers to india , there was me thinking npower could not get any worse , ther customer_care is so poor now , can not wait_till january when i can move , i have on line account that never works never up dates readings , they never reply to emails , they are only intrested in taking money out of my account , my dd have doubled in a year am now over two hundred pound in credit , this is a company to avoid
2	used the hounslow branch to buy a camera online , never recived , rang branch three_times told to ring back first time next two times my number was taken and told they would ring me back , never happened , next_day rang again , told the item had been sent to other store would sort_out and send me tracking_number never happend , rang again told they had sorted it promised to refund postage as good will gesture , again nothing happened , this company is run as franchise , some branches just dont care ,
2	tried to part exchange my vehicle - westway nissan oldham gave_me the lowest part exchange value on my vehicle based on webuyanycar . com ignoring the £_0k worth of extras .
2	the webuyanycar . com price on their vehicle was £ 0000 less_than ticket price .
2	differential was £ 0000 ignoring extras on my car and greedy barstewards still wanted £ 0000 plus my car .
2	gemma at key_retirements made the whole_process easy_peasy .
2	they kept in constant_communication , simplified the form_filling and i would recommend them to anyone shopping for an annuity .
2	couldn_'_t believe_how easy it was - even an old silver_surfer like me completed the form in minutes - and i saved over £_000 against last_year '_s provider '_s quote for this year .
2	i told them not to bother when they said " let_me have a look and see what i can do " - i ' d already bought from home protect .
2	recently_bought an electric_trolley .
2	delivered even earlier_than promised and at a very competative price .
2	will return again .
