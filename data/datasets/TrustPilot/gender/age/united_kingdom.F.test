0	i used live_chat today and sarah_h helped_me out with an order i was finding hard to book myself , rather_than talking me through it she gave_me the option to do the order for me it took 0 mintues and she made it stress_free .
0	the service was great and i will use again in the future .
0	thank_you !!!
0	!
0	this has got to be the worst company i have ever had to deal with !
0	i ordered 0 tickets at the end of june this year ( that is 0_months_ago ) for a ben howard concert that took place on the 00th_november .
0	i was getting regular email_updates telling_me not to worry - my tickets were being tracked , they would be here etc .
0	well that was a load of s ** t . i rang the customer service number several_times 0_days , 0_days and on the day of the event explaining i was yet to have my tickets !
0	i was originally told they would try and find me some other tickets - this was never taken up and on the day of the concert when i was still_waiting to receive my tickets i was simply told i would have to get a refund .
0	hold on , i booked these tickets 0_months_ago , have waited very patiently , they were for a birthday_present - and i was being told i could go to the gig ??
0	anyway 0hrs .. yes 0hrs before my gig in london - i am based in kent , my tickets finally arrived !
0	not only was this unacceptable and diabolical enough , leaving me in such a rush , but when i read the face value of the tickets £_00 . 00 each i had paid over 0 x each per_ticket plus nearly_£_00 for p_&_p that arrived so late i nearly_missed the show !
0	this site is disgraceful , i got no help and should have been offered some kind of refund or at_least my £_00 postage returned back to me .. at the very least !
0	never use this site .
0	very badly run , and a massive rip_off !
0	i have been using this company to purchase gifts , cosmetics and fragrances for years_now , i have never had a problem with their service and find them better_than some leading online stores who i have had a nightmare with .
0	fragrance_direct have always delivered my goods promptly and in perfect_condition , they have a gift_wrapping service which is absolutely divine .
0	their sales and promotions are amazing , i would definitely recommend them !
0	spend a lot of my free time on smooch winning big money !!
0	:)
0	the company was really accommodating and managed to pick_up the coffee_table with just one day '_s notice .
0	they called us to let us know when they would be arriving and helped_us with the unloading .
0	the only_thing i regret is not getting their business card !
0	thank_you :)
0	had a problem and sammie_taylor sorted it straight out for me .
0	i use parcel to go on a regular_basis and never have any_problems with them , if there is a problem they always sort it out !
0	very good company to deal with . fast and proffesional after dealing_with groupon and the infurn saga since nov . very good customer service . thank_you
0	i ordered a big_boy beanbag in wk 00 and was told wk 00 .
0	now its wk 0 . so even if it does get sent out it will still be 00 weeks .
0	not good customer service .
0	same as with everything right now as soon as you see unlock , iphones etc .
0	the first thing you think , oh .. maybe it is an scam ... should i ?
0	we '_ll i was thinking exactly that but i gave it a try .
0	and it has worked_perfectly .
0	no_issues whatsoever .
0	the only minor thing is the time .
0	it took 00h , but right now my iphone is perfectly unlocked via itunes .
0	as soon as i plugged it in , itunes itself said : congratulations , your iphone is now unlocked .
0	and since then everything works .
0	many_thanks officialiphoneunlock .
0	would recommend you any day .
0	i went to the doctors on the thursday to see if i could get an asthma inhaler and found out i wouldn_'_t get the prescription until wednesday .
0	my inhaler was basically empty and i really needed one .
0	then i found health_express .
0	i ordered on the friday and received my inhalers on the saturday .
0	absolutely amazing .
0	very fast delivery - would recommend to others
0	i ordered flowers to be delivered to my friend in australia for her wedding on february 00th .
0	today is february 00th and they have still not arrived .
0	the occasion has now passed so even if the flowers reach her now it would be pointless .
0	i spoke to someone on the livechat application the day after the delivery was supposed to arrived and they guaranteed they would contact the florist in australia who the order was with and email asap .
0	two_days_later i have still had no contact from anyone .
0	today i rang the office number for iflorist and the call was answered by a completely disinterested member of staff .
0	she tried to fob me off saying the flowers may have been left with a neighbour .
0	when i explained to her that this was not the case as my friend had checked she didn_'_t know what to say .
0	she then_proceeded to tell me she would contact the florist via_email and get back to me by the end of today .
0	when i explained there was a 00 hour time difference and i doubted very much the florist would reply in the middle of the night she didn_'_t seem at all concerned .
0	i now have no interest if the flowers are delivered or not .
0	the occasion has passed and the surprise has_been spoiled for a dear_friend .
0	all i want in a refund for the £_00 i handed_over .
0	terrible , terrible service all_round .
0	please_avoid this company at all costs .
0	lovely chat_hosts always welcoming and free money its lovely
0	i visited the tictac stand at blair atholl horse trials last month and saw a hat that i really liked .
0	the girls were friendly , approachable and helpful .
0	they went above and beyond to help me .
0	they ordered me a hat in and it was with the a few_days_later , posted to my door free of charge .
0	would highly_recommend this company .
0	trustworthy , reliable service !
0	website was recommended to me and have never ordered tyres this way but was simple to do and when i arrived at the garage at a time that suited me i get great service , dealt_with me straight_away and staff very pleasant and helpful .
0	would definatelt tell friends / family to order this way to
0	i originally found this site by trying to purchase the brand of vitamins for women called ' wellwoman '.
0	i went to hollands and barret first , then thought i '_d compare_prices from the wellwoman official site .
0	not only was the vitabotics webpage better laid_out , the prices for the vitamins were alot less_than they were on h_& b , plus there was a sale on !
0	so i could not have been happier .
0	this will be my staple site for getting this amazing brand of vitamins that work for me .
0	the delivery time was ok and even got some freebie which was totally awesome !
0	i mean , which company ever give away freebies in this economic_climate ?
0	vitabiotics are number one !
0	wooohooo !!
0	!
0	fantastic weekend that included quad biking , extreme buggy races , nude life_drawing , copious_amounts of alcohol , sexy superheroes and toe jam !
0	i was particularly impressed with how well pet_prescription handled my order .
0	they rang to check details and were pleasant and helpful on the phone .
0	the order was dispatched promptly too .
0	i would definitely recommend this website .
0	i put my order at the same time as my housemate , she got hers 0_days afterwards .
0	i '_m not bothered by a delay in delivery per_se , but i '_ve sent them 0 emails requesting despatchement confirmation and they simply do not reply .
0	can '_t find any telephone_numbers or other email addresses on their website , and it '_s just incredibly annoying .
0	i got an autogenerated email regarding my order - it had been put on hold .
0	i then contacted their help_desk , they replied promptly , and i then stated the correct info they were lacking .
0	however , they never confirmed my update nor my order status , so i have no idea if my order went through or not .
0	inconvenient for me as i need my order asap .
0	we had shopped about quiet a bit for my wife '_s engagement_ring but found the perfect one at marlows .
0	we got a very fair price but nothing tops the service we received .
0	honest_opinions , great knowledge and such genuine friendliness that the purchase became even more special .
0	although living just outside london , there was no question of going anywhere_else when the time came to buy the wedding_bands .
0	ann & tor
0	thanks clive ( diginate ) for the assistance you had provided ; bumping up the production line to make it in time for my deadlined and giving me a student rate !
0	on top of it all , the results were fabulous !
0	i will be sending you pictures soon !
0	best !
0	i ordered a game for a christmas_present 00th_december_0000 .
0	needless to say it didn_'_t come through in time , and upon_checking the website it was out of stock .
0	no communication , nothing .
0	i emailed asking for a refund .
0	no response .
0	0st_march_0000 , i finally receive the game !!
0	that '_s almost three_months with no communication whatsoever !!
0	what a joke .
0	we live in california and get our items shipped !
0	we love all the freebies and extras and the price match does work accurately ( no you can '_t scam them !).
0	overall great company !
0	easy to navigate , provides all the information you need .
0	very clear about cancellation policies and doesn_'_t rip you off on booking_fees .
0	great price , quick delivery and quick response to questions ask .
0	would use gameseek again .
0	horrible company will never use ever again not customer based just god awful in general not plesant at all .
0	very condisending .
0	signal problems never listened to the problem and just presented written excuses .
0	poor company in general .
0	i have used serenata before and they have been great .
0	i decided to order some flowers for my grandma '_s birthday last_week and they didn_'_t just come very late in the day but the quality of the flowers were awful .
0	they ' re already dying and only received them on thursday .
0	i have been really impressed with their service but unfortunately after this i will not be using them again .
0	you just cant_beat supplement_warehouse in price or selection .
0	they have everything you need and then some .
0	the fast shipping is a plus .
0	as well as there descriptions of each product .
0	giving good detail that allows you to know what your buying .
0	the coolest thing is the free stuff you can get upon every order .
0	its not just 0 or 0 things .
0	its a whole list of items you can choose from for free .
0	i also look at there sales or closeout deals .
0	because sometimes i have a little extra money and dont mind spending it on a rediculous deal like the closeouts .
0	then other times im tight in money .
0	so i look toward the sales to try and get what i need .
0	now that was everything good .
0	not that there is anything bad for say .
0	just that there is always room for improvement .
0	right ?
0	well what supplement_warehouse can approve is the site itself .
0	its not awful .
0	but its not the easiest site to operate either .
0	sometimes its hard to find what your looking for .
0	so the navigation part needs to be tweaked a little or just simplfied .
0	also , it would be nice to have a option to arrange from lowest_price to highest price .
0	or most_popular to least popular .
0	and then i would like to know if im signed in or not .
0	i cant see anywhere that lets me know im signed in .
0	which in turn there could be a box that lists what ive ordered before or what i order all the time .
0	to again make it easier and quicker to place a order .
0	these are just a couple things i would change if i could .
0	but over all i still stand firm on .
0	that supplement_warehouse is the best supplement supply store on the street and on the web , hands_down !
0	thanks for reading my review and take care .
0	i was worried when i read a lot of negative_reviews but can_honestly_say i had no problem with the company !
0	i ordered the flowers on the tuesday_afternoon to be delivered to a london office the following_day .
0	the order process was easy , then i was getting email_updates re my order and then had an update once it had been delivered the next_day !
0	all in all it was great .
0	arrived on time , flowers were lovely and the choice to add like a balloon was a fab idea !
0	thank_you for making my sisters_00th_birthday that bit more special .
0	i enquired_about recycling my phone on the thursday , by friday i had received the free_postage packet to send my phone back in , i sent my phone out on the saturday ( i chose to add ' signed for ' delivery ), then on monday i had an_email and text to say my phone had been received and by that evening the funds had been transferred to my bank_account ... may i add that the funds were what i was quoted !
0	i have read some good & bad_reviews but i can_honestly_say that the whole processed was so easy and fast and the transaction from_start to finish was excellent !
0	very impressed !
0	!
0	i ordered my item , paid for it and then 0_days_later i received an_email explaining that this item wasn_'_t in stock and wouldn_'_t be for the next 0 - 0_weeks .
0	i emailed back asking to cancel my order and they did so immediately and a refund was issued .
0	the wesbite is easy to use and you can manage all your bookings online - habdy when you ' re on the road .
0	the customer service team are really good at dealing_with questions and come_back to you fairly quickly .
0	only_negative_comment is that the company doesnt have a smartphone app - would love this !
0	i was very disappointed with the daffodils i had purchased especially as i had upgraded the bouquet to a larger one .
0	they arrived and were all fully open and dying with some already dead .
0	i had expected the daffodils to arrive in a similar state as you would purchase them in a shop , a mixture of unopened and just starting to open flowers so they could be enjoyed for a number of days .
0	when you send flowers it is usually for a significant reason and i was disappointed to find out the gesture was of shadowed by the poor quality of the flowers .
0	couple this with the expense of sending daffodils ( in comparison to the couple of pounds you can buy them for in a shop ) i would not recommend serenataflowers . com .
0	i purchased an item on 00th_november delivery within 00 days , even_though they were charging extortionate £ 0 . 00 for a small item you would think it would be sent first_class recorded .
0	however since then nothing , obviously the two_weeks has past and i have sent two emails and i am still none the wiser .
0	in times of recession people can '_t afford to have their money taken from them especially when the voucher was a gift for a date which has now passed .
0	not acceptable and not worth the risk .
0	i don_'_t see how hard it is to reply to an_email surely the profit from p_&_p is enough to pay for a customer_services team .
0	i originally thought this was a good site but that '_s when you redeem from 0rd_party suppliers .
0	when you redeem direct from wowcher you '_ve basically lost your money !
0	great variety of supplies for every type of party , great service had my order delivered to ireland in less that 0_days .
0	all items ordered are better_than described !
0	staff where very polite and helpful called to ensure my order was ok and to make_sure what i ordered was correct as my order was so big also called for extra security on my card .
0	highly recommed partyrama .
0	will use them again in the future .
0	all items very resonably_priced .
0	they refused to guarantee a driver who rude and intimidating to myself ( i was alone in the house with my baby ).
0	would not be allowed to deliver to our house again .
0	after sending written confirmation my monthly pass would be cancelled in nov_0000 they have just taken 0 payments for may and june_0000 despite not having ordered anything from them .
0	do not use !
0	i highly_recommend serenata_flowers excellent service !
0	will be using them again in future .
0	the website is very easy to use and it details the frame sizes , which is very handy as i require smaller frames .
0	the prescription_sunglasses arrived ahead of the predicted_timescale , just in time for the sun !
0	the style looks fashionable and the glasses feel good quality .
0	the fitter arrived on time and changed the two tyres promptly .
0	it was easy to book and pay online and the service provided was excellent .
0	so much more convenient than taking the car to a garage .
0	the tyres are reasonably_priced , but good quality .
0	i would recommend etyres .
0	as per_usual hospitalityfinder did all they could for me .
0	the freight team had two amazing events in a matter of weeks .
0	firstly wimbledon for the second year running , this time centre court .
0	secondly , for the first time we attended the british grand prix , fantastic day was had by all clients and staff .
0	this is definately an event we will take part in again next year .
0	i always find sue a pleasure to deal with and nothing is ever too much_trouble .
0	i would highly_recommend sue and her team to anyone looking for the best hospitality experience .
0	just one brilliant company with such great service and customer_relations
0	i recently_sold two mobiles through mazumamobile and what an excellent price and such an excellent service .
0	payment in the bank before i could_blink without_any hassle .
0	if you are looking to sell your mobile then deal with this company .
0	brilliant and all in time for christmas .
0	thank_you
0	despite having an ann_summers in my area , i thought i would save myself some time by ordering online for my first valentines with my boyfriend .
0	i placed an order for a lingerie set on the 00st of january , allowing plenty of time for valentines .
0	my voucher_code wasn_'_t applied in my confirmation_email , so i rang customer_services to sort it out .
0	a lovely lady made the necessary amendments and i continued to wait for the products to arrive .
0	after 00 days ( on an apparently 0 - 0 working day standard delivery ), there was still no sign of the item , so emailed via the website .
0	no reply .
0	so i rang up and spent a good 00_minutes on hold .
0	still no pick_up .
0	so i rang the next_morning , and still spent 00_minutes on hold .
0	so i emailed again .
0	still no response .
0	after 0 more emails and another 00_minutes total time on hold , i eventually got hold of a man from the team , at about 00pm on the 00th - only one day before valentines .
0	he was very unhelpful and said that my order had been on hold .
0	later on in the conversation when i questioned_why my package hadn_'_t been delivered , he blamed it on royal_mail ( contradicting his previous comments ).
0	he then_proceeded to tell me that if ann_summers hadn_'_t been notified of a problem , they couldnt fix it .
0	im not sure what else i was expected to do , having already sent 0 messages and clocked up a whopping hour ( plus ) of time on an 0000 number .
0	eventually , after much grovelling , i had still no empathy , nor compensation for the fact that my valentines surprise for my boyfriend was no_longer arriving .
0	he finished off the conversation by saying that the cancellation was fine , but the refund may take up to 00 days to get back into my account .
0	he was very unapologetic and didn_'_t seem to care about my loyalty to the company .
0	i am so gutted to have been treated so badly by what i had previously considered to be a fantastic company offering great products .
0	i am still_waiting for my refund and wouldn_'_t be surprised if it took over the 00 working_days to get to me , considering the previous standard of service i have been subjected to .
0	with a growing number of competing companies , i '_m surprised to have seen such appalling customer service .
0	my advice : in store service is great , but if youre considering buying online , go elsewhere .
0	its not worth the hassle .
0	i needed a lens but wasn_’_t sure if it was worth shelling_out £ 0 , 000_+ just yet , as it may not have been suitable for the photos i wanted to take .
0	then i came_across this site hiring lens to customers and when i read the reviews thought i ’ d give it a try , after all i would be covered for insurance etc and the prices were more than reasonable .
0	aside from the fantastic lens ( which i give canon credit for , on this occasion !)
0	the customer service from lensforhire was second to none !
0	there are no_negatives i could attribute to this service and would definitely be using them again !
0	well_done on such great customer service !
0	this website contains any pen you can think of .
0	free and prompt delivery makes it worth the while .
0	have been buying from here for years and the prices are reasonable compared to high_st retailers .
0	excellent service !!!
0	second time i sold my old phone to mazuma and i have nothing else to say apart_from brilliant !
0	i have shopped @ jokers_masquerade for many_years_now for various fancy_dress costumes including christmas & halloween .
0	always had a wide_variety of different costumes for all ages , sizes & gender .
0	have recommend them many_times to friends & family_members who have also being pleased with the site .
0	will_continue to shop there for my future fancy_dress needs :)
0	the t - shirts are really smart , a really quick delivery , great price and amazing quality and variety of t - shirts and other items just brilliant !
0	this bingo site is great come and join us you won_'_t be let_down .
0	they sent me an extortionately high bill stating that my energy use has tripled !!!!
0	when i called and stated that i cannot imagine how i could have used that much energy , i was told that i simply have to pay the £_000 within the next 0_days .
0	i refused this and cancelled my direct_debit .
0	i was then offered to monitor my meter and take a reading at the same time of the day for the next 0_days , which i did .
0	this showed my daily usage to average 0 units and not the alleged 00 !!!
0	when i called back to report this , i was told that i still have to pay the £_000 but that i can spread this in my direct_debit over the next 00 months .
0	i had to agree to this as the guy stated there was no other option .
0	a couple of days_later i noticed that my meter had dropped more than 0000 units .
0	again , i called edf and was then told that the meter might be faulty and that i now do not have to pay the £_000 and my monthly direct_debit has dropped right back down .
0	no apology , no nothing .
0	i will be changing energy_supplier !!
0	!
0	low_prices , free stuff !!
0	!
0	very pleased with my first order and i will be using them in future for any of my reptile requirements .
0	very fast delivery , have unfortunately returned the shoes as they weren_'_t comfortable but they offer free_returns so that was quick and easy .
0	i have used animed several_times_now and each time they have delivered very quickly and their prices and range of goods are both great .
0	i have used medicanimal several_times and have always found orders are received quickly and their prices are some of the cheapest on the internet with free delivery on everything .
0	bean_bags are high_quality at great prices and are delivered next_day by courier .
0	i bought the purple suede xl bean_bag and loved it so much i also bought the matching bean cube .
0	fast delivery in very plain_packaging .
0	great product range a +
0	i found monster_pet_supplies prices are very good and they delivered my item quickly .
0	fast delivery and great choice of products at low_prices .
0	we have been delighted with the quality of your products , and hope to place many more orders in the future , even_though quoted 0 - 0 day delivery , items received carriage free next_day from ordering .
0	will definitely give your name to friends who require mobility equipment .
0	thank_you !
0	snabb_leverans , och supersköna underkläder , välplacerade pengar , helt enkelt !
0	jävligt bra service , pack - snubben rickard på lyko ser alltid till att mina beställningar hamnar hos posten inom 00h och_jag har oftast paketen dagen_efter , det_är riktigt snabb service på kanonprodukter och_jag älskar utförsäljningarna och reaprodukterna och kampanjvarorna , har uteslutit alla andra siter nu och gått över till lyko helt , nu köper jag till och med min tandkräm från lyko eftersom det_är så enkelt !
0	i placed an order fro over_£_000 of items .
0	they seemed like a great price at first .
0	i then paid for my items and waited for the order confirmation .
0	i received the email and to my surprise there was an extra_charge of £_00 because i paid by mastercard . what a joke !
0	this did not show clearly on the last ordering page .
0	i phoned them within 0 minutes of placing the order and asked to cancel because of the card charge .
0	they said i could cancel but i wouldnt get £_00 refunded !
0	they also said that the order would still be dispatched as they couldnt contact the warehouse . i then asked what courier they would use so i could reject the parcel , and they couldnt give me those details either !
0	john sharma the sales_guy , then said if i do sign for it accidently .
0	then i would have to send it back at my cost , plus pay the cost of original delivery and then when it was received at the ilgs warehouse , i would have to pay an extra restocking charge of 00_% the total value of the order .
0	never use this company .
0	and if you check other forums , no one has anything good to say about them , i wish i checked before hand .
0	at_least ive try to warn other people !
0	ah - mazing !
0	being in a very small town , there are not many choices here , but when i found this company , i was stoked .
0	i was able to order my dymatize from them , and they went even lower_than the lowest_price i could find on the web !
0	so , for 00 bucks ( yes , 00 ) i got my 0lbs shake mix , a shaker_cup and whisk ball , an 0 oz sample of sculpting lotion , and a t - shirt !
0	that even included my shipping !
0	andi could have gotten literally a ton of samples , but i am already beyond happy just with the prices i payed !
0	i applied to sell my laptop on a sunday , it was picked_up on monday , acceptance confirmed on tuesday , and money hit my bank_account on wednesday .
0	you don_'_t get more efficient than this !
0	myself and my fiance decided to buy from quality diamonds purely on their great reviews and total value for money .
0	i knew_exactly_what i wanted in terns of diamond cut and quality and with qd they had a wealth of stones to suit within our budget .
0	i have no_doubt that if i went into a another jewellers and picked the spec of my ring we would be charged double what we paid .
0	the service is truly great and qd were also able to resize my ring within 00_hours when i found it was a little big .
0	no one should just walk into jewellers and buy a ring blindly , do you research and then check out qd and get an amazing piece of jewellery at an amazing price !
0	i have recently placed an order with outdoorkit , the delivery was prompt and well communicated .
0	i then realised i had ordered the wrong_size and had to make contact to exchange .
0	the whole_process was handled absolutely superbly by the team at outdoorkit and i would strongly_recommend them to any of my friends for outdoor_clothing and equipment .
0	i was impressed with the range available and prices were also reasonable .
0	it was well_packaged and arrived as per postage paid .
0	i would definitely use this company agsin and have already_recommended them and joined their facebook_page .
0	this purchase was for my first dslr_camera as i want to take up photography .
0	after looking around on the internet for my chosen model ( nikon_d0000 ) digitalrev offered the best price by quite a substantial margin for the body and a 00 - 00mm lens , which is great to start with .
0	after_placing my order late on a sunday_evening i was not expecting to receive it until the end of the week at_least , as i live in south_wales , uk .
0	however , it was dispatched on monday and it arrived on wednesday which was amazing .
0	the tracking on the order was brilliant as you can check the progress too .
0	the camera was extremely well_packaged and a uk plug adapter was also included which was helpful .
0	i am really pleased with the camera so far and would recommend the camera to others .
0	you can find plenty of reviews on the internet about this camera .
0	as previous_reviews state the instructions aren_'_t in english .
0	however , you can easily download a pdf manual off the nikon site so this isn_'_t a problem .
0	i would definitely recommend this site to others , and already have done .
0	i will also return to purchase lenses etc in future .
0	cannot_fault the item or service supplied by digitalrev .

0	i booked the transfer in_advance as i required a child_seat .
0	driver was on time and bus was in excellent condition with the baby_seat i asked for .
0	price very reasonable compared to other transfer websites .
0	i would use this company again and would recommend it to friends and family .
0	helpful clear advice , paperwork was done for me .
0	great pricing .
0	i would recommend to anyone who is looking for a credit_card machine or to swap their current_supplier .
0	also got something for a referral .
0	very professional at all times , very clear information .
0	main_thing i love about cams is the chat_hosts an the friends i have met on there
0	this site is fabulous

0	with the recent heat waves i ordered a cooling coat for my small crossbreed dog .
0	due to the weather and the coat '_s popularity it went out of stock fast and their suppliers were slow getting more in - not viovets fault , the coats were just in high_demand everywhere .
0	viovet asked if i wanted to cancel my order for a complete refund , i asked them if i could be a bit_annoying and swap the order for another cooling coat that was available at the time and that cost slightly less .
0	viovet arranged this quickly , with no_fuss and gave_me a partial_refund on the extra_cost but alas the new cooling coat was then also out of stock .
0	i can say now that the coat has now arrived and been used for the first time today and it works_perfectly so i have got a cool , comfy , happy pup snoozing away .
0	the viovet team are fast , friendly and efficient at their jobs and always aim to please .
0	my pets and i look_forward to dealing_with them more in the future !
0	keep_up the good work everyone !
0	fast , friendly , accurate and you can pay with paypal !
0	delivered by royal_mail so if you miss the delivery and it doesn_'_t fit through your door you don_'_t have to go far to collect your items , just to your nearest post_office .

0	great service and was deliverd by city_link today in the last 0mins they kindly but big box in sided for me every thankful and will be reccomend to friends and family
0	:)
0	flowers were sent half_dead and very small , ordered balloons but they didn_'_t even turn_up .
0	very difficult to get_hold of them on the phone , waited for an_hour to finally get through , sent a pic like they asked but they wouldn_'_t refund !
0	do not use this company !!
0	very bad service and terrible flowers !
0	waste of £_00 !
0	great service and always have good deals on the printers .
0	never had a problem with delivery .
0	i always by printers for work from here
0	not sure_whether they sell second - hand good as ' new ', but i ordered a phone and it came with just the phone and charger in a box - no instruction_manual or anything .
0	they really screwed_up my delivery by failing ensure that the correct instructions were on the parcel .
0	this caused me immense inconvenience and ruined a weekend ( it was a birthday_gift for a friend ).
0	i paid a large_amount for next_day delivery for the privilege .
0	when i complained , they were rude and sarcasitc and did not deal with my complaint in a professional_manner .
0	they also absoutely refused to answer my question about whether the phone should have an instruction_manual with it .
0	they did not refund any postage either .
0	incredibly incompetent people , and zero customer service .
0	the way that a company treats their customers is one of the best indicators of whether they are worth dealing_with .
0	it is fine to have cheap prices , but i would rather pay more to have the confidence that any_problems will be dealt_with satisfactorily .
0	i would advise anyone against using this company , as they are only interested in the sale , absolutely no regard for their customers , or take any responsiblity in the event of a problem .
0	prices are significant_savings_compared to other_websites , but delivery is very slow .
0	i would expect much_faster delivery for ordering online .
0	great holiday with blackpool promotions .
0	staff are all very friendly and helpful from reception to waiters to bar staff .
0	cabaret staff are great too .
0	my flight time got pushed back by 0_days and i asked for a refund and some compensation towards booking a new flight since they notified me last_minute and flight costs have doubled in price ( i couldn_'_t take the new flight since i had a connecting_flight with the original flight ).
0	the customer service lady ....( name ) ( sp ?)
0	was very rude and confrontational saying they are not responsible since it '_s the airline '_s fault and won_'_t do anything to appease the situation .
0	finally they agreed to issue me the refund but said it will take 00 days to get the money back !!!!
0	worst service ever ...
0	i will never book with them again !!
0	!
0	very good dealing_with all your questions and queries !
0	great !
0	thanks a lot !
0	the best company i '_ve dealt_with in my life .
0	no bull sh ** fast and easy ordering , cheap prices , quick delivery , always on time , and never had an issue with my orders or payments .
0	the best !
0	hands_down !!!
0	!
0	i would definetly_recomend double0tickets .
0	was buying tickets last_minuite for a mcfly concert and ended_up mucking up my order acciently ordering 0 instead of four tickets .
0	but just called their number and they sorted it out adding an extra ticket to my order with no additional posting cost .
0	the tickets arrived the very next_day , much to my relief !
0	i bought a pair of shoes at a remarkable discount .
0	received the shoes , didn_'_t fit .
0	now as anyone will know who shops online , the usual procedure is that you let the company know the shoes didn_'_t fit , and they come and collect them whilst delivering another pair .
0	i had no clue how to get a refund with groupon , so i contacted them and a week or so later i got an_email requesting details and to reply back to help @ groupon . co . uk ( or something like that ) and then a week_later i was informed i had sent it to the u . s groupon ( even_though i did send it to the uk ) so i emailed the uk again .
0	after a lot of timely and annoying back - and - fro i eventually got the info i needed to contact the vendor .
0	the vendor then informed me that i would be charged to send my shoes back as the postage would be at my own_expense .
0	this was about 0_weeks after receiving my shoes and to avoid hassle i never returned them .
0	groupon need to make_sure they have the vendors refund policy clearly_stated on groupons website , and have a more efficient help system .
0	i am very dissapointed and will never buy from them again in fear of not liking the product .
0	the good deals are countered by the rubbish service .
0	beware .
0	i found everything i needed on one site and they compare_prices to anyone_else .
0	free stuff with every purchase .
0	everytime i order from the protein_works i am impressed !!
0	delivery is always earlier_than_expected , products are always top_notch and the service from the staff at tpw is great !!
0	they are supportive and always happy to answer any_questions .
0	i would highly_recommend tpw to anyone .
0	so many products to choose from and at great prices too
0	thanks millions

0	i could not recommend payplan more .
0	from the first time i contacted them almost 0 years_ago they have been super helpful , explaining everything and making me feel at ease and now i am coming to the end ( 0_months remaining ) of my plan , i know without payplan and the plan they put me on i would be so much worse off .
0	can look back now and see getting myself into debt was a bad thing .... but we all make_mistakes and payplan didn_'_t judge at any point .
0	my case officer has_been there whenever i have had questions and it '_s really easy to amend payments at any time during the plan ( like if u want to increase or decrease monthly_payments )
0	they deal with everything on your behalf and it '_s been a god_send
0	i don_'_t know how i would of been able to cope and repay all my debt without this in place
0	i can '_t thank_you enough

0	in april_0000 , i ordered a double sink vanity_unit , back to the wall_toilet and back to the wall cupboard unit from onlinebathrooms , at a total_cost of £_000 . 00 including shipping .
0	i was very happy with my items .
0	last_week , i went back on to the website to order the matching mirror unit .
0	to cut a long and infuriating story_short , the mirror was only available as an add - on to the vanity_unit at a cost of £_000 .
0	when i rang to try and order it separately they updated the website to list it as a separate item but increased the price to £_000 !!
0	i make that 00_% increase .
0	when i complained they said they '_d had a price increase from their supplier which they hadn_'_t known about until i called .
0	despite me explaining that surely that wasn_'_t my fault they refused to sell the mirror at the advertised price and i have been forced to contact consumer_direct for advice .
0	there are so many bathroom companies selling online so my advice is avoid this lot and shopping elsewhere .
0	they are great , your never waiting to long for your car to be picked_up or dropped_off and the staff are excellent ( even at 0 :_00am ) haha !!
0	also very informative on where to go ...
0	i always use aardvark parking and would recommend it to any of my friends and family !
0	excellent service overall !
0	i was a little_nervous_about using gadgetpanda because i '_ve never sent off items for payment .
0	however , i found them to be excellent !!
0	i was informed on progress at each_step including when my item had arrived , how much the item had been revised for and when the payment was on it '_s way .
0	i was paid within the 00_hours as stated on the website .
0	i was happy with both the service and the amount offered for the items .
0	i would recommend gadgetpanda to anyone and will definitely use again in the future !!
0	thanks .
0	i ordered some flowers for my mum for mother '_s day , and picked next say delivery , i was told they would be delivered sat 00th_march and also had an_email_confirming this .
0	saturday went and i sent 0 emails chasing them up with no reply , sunday came and went and another 0 emails with no reply !!
0	the flowers finally turned_up on monday after mother '_s day and as they had obviously been in transit for days we ' re half_dead !!
0	a phone_call made and staff were so unhelpful but have me a managers email , i emailed saying i wanted a refund , had no reply !!
0	disgusting service !!
0	surfice to say i will be taking this further
0	cheapest for the monitor and delivery on time .
0	keep it up
0	i won one of the friday easter competitions and within a couple of days i had my easter_eggs and my free t - shirt with me , as well as a £_00 voucher on the web_site .
0	the person_who i had to phone to claim the prizes was very friendly and helpful , telling_me exactly_what i needed to do .
0	everything is great quality and a perfect_fit and i '_ll definitely be using the site more often .
0	thank_you =)
0	i was looking for a flavor of protein at a good price and you guys have it , always .
0	i was told the flowers were lovely and the delivery was the exact day i asked for , would definitely use again
0	beautiful quality print of my husband '_s work .
0	as a professional_photographer , he '_s pretty picky about his prints , and was delighted with the canvas .
0	quickly dispatched , and the most responsive company to do_business with .
0	will always use this company again in the future .
0	i purchased a beauty treatment through wowcher over 0_weeks_ago , it was cancelled by the client and wowcher emailed me to let_me know i would receive a refund within 0 - 00days .
0	i have yet to receive any money back despite sending them 0 emails and calling twice and requesting a call back , but still nothing .
0	the website was very easy to navigate and has a wide_range of hostels and other accommodation types .
0	i was also pleased there was no booking_fee and only a 00_% deposit was required :)
0	i really needed to find some flowers for next_day delivery and i hunted through google and found serenata_flowers , ordered a bunch for next_day , then i began reading_reviews !
0	i was horrified , and very nervous that my flowers would not make it and i have been checking the status update all day only to have a very pleased mum thanking_me for beautifull flowers .
0	i ordered the flowers around_midday the day before and they were with her by 00 the next_day !
0	very happy customer and i will use them again !
0	:)
0	my appointment was booked for between 0pm - 0pm , andy turned_up early despite all the problems on the road today , great service and will definitely use again !
0	thanks
0	purchased from shopto several_times and each time have had my expectations exceeded .
0	prices are always better_than_anywhere_else , delivery has always been next_day ( even_though it '_s free !)
0	and when there has ever been a problem with the game itself , they have exchanged it without_any fuss at all .
0	we never look anywhere_else to buy games now !
0	thanks shopto !
0	my husband is so awkward having his_birthday on 00th_dec .
0	this makes it really tricky to get an online sale item and have it delivered in time .
0	zavvi had the game i wanted for the best price .
0	i ordered it on boxing_day and it arrived on the morning of the 00th_dec !
0	i was amazed !
0	hi mates :
0	everything worked smoothly in less_than one day ( from at & t to an italian carrier ).
0	absolutely recommended !
0	cheers
0	in short .
0	they just stopped my internet one day ( the same day i paid for the previous month ).
0	it just stopped , nothing .
0	i spent about a week back and forth with their customer service who blamed my computers and router constantly ( despite the problem happening on multiple computers and 0 routers ).
0	when i finally got to speak to technical_support they laughed at the customer support and then told me they haven_'_t done any of the internal tests they said they were doing .
0	after technical_support done their tests they told me it was their problem as their system wasn_'_t accepting my username and password and if it wasn_'_t fixed the next_day to phone them .
0	i phoned the next_day and i was back to square one , they were asking me to reset my router and other stupid tests i had already done .
0	i got my mac code from them and it never worked so i had to outright cancel it .
0	avoid talk_talk
0	evil company , take your belongings and do not honour the agreement and do not pay you any of the money you are owed , and refuse to have contact with .
0	i will be taking the company to a small - claims court , so look_forward to hearing from me soon jack williams .
0	theft and fraud is illegal , and you won_'_t get away with it .
0	great conference_call service , never had any_issues with it .
0	we needed a new dryer and the whole_process was painless and very quick yet through .
0	we got advised on an affordable yet energy efficient product with no_pressure .
0	we will definitely go back its the best appliance store around .

0	as a bonus they have discount schemes & prize draws which is awesome !!
0	will be always ordering from healthysupplies
0	the website was great , very user_friendly .
0	i liked the easy to understand performance information .
0	i liked that i could choose which garage to use and they too were very efficient .
0	also there was no_hidden_charges .
0	very impressed and will use them for tyres again in future .

0	the triple_wardrobe , 0 + 0 and bedside_cabinets are so beautiful and have exceptional storage_space .
0	:)
0	wimdu is great because it offers options for travelers of all_budgets .
0	i loved how easy it was to use their website , and all the people who are renting out their apartments are really friendly and helpful i '_ve noticed !
0	i '_m even considering putting my place for rent as it seems like a really trustworthy company .
0	thanks wimdu !
0	my experience is clearly much_better_than some others or perhaps it '_s those with problems who are more likely to leave a review :- i ordered a new_cooker door_handle for my v old cooker and also emailed the company , belling , at the same time ' just in case '.
0	within a day my order at spares 0 go showed ' on order from supplier ', however a few_days_later i received an reply from belling to say the part was obsolete .
0	i emailed spares0go to let them know and to ask whether this meant that they couldn_'_t get the part for me .
0	within 00_minutes i had a reply to say they had a pair of slightly_different handles and they would be sending those , so that cooker and grill door_handles matched , at no extra_cost .
0	they arrived today and although i need to use a washer , not supplied , with them they are otherwise perfect .
0	i received my new cannon mg0000 printer yesterday morning at 00 . 00am after ordering the day before at around 0 . 00pm , the speed of delivery is almost unbelievable and has to be highly commended .
0	the printer is absolutely great , i have been using hp professional printers for the past 00 years and this cannon mg0000 absolutely knocks_spots off my old hp officejet 0000 and is about half the price .
0	well_done canon and many_thanks to printerland for your superb service - highly_reccommended !
0	received cheque within 0_days of sending phones , have used this company twice_now and believe it to be first_class .
0	i '_ve always loved this site , but the recent website revamp has made it so much_better which is why i felt it was time to leave a review !
0	when the whole family '_s contracts are up it can be both expensive and stressful but phonesltd had everything i needed and their customer service was brilliant .
0	would recommend to anyone !
0	!
0	i would absolutely use this company again .
0	absolutely_brilliant , great prices , super_fast delivery .
0	i always used hostelbookers as it '_s always quick , easy and reliable .
0	i like that i can filter it according to what it is that is most_important to me ( eg .
0	from lowest to highest cost ) and it clearly shows which rooms are singles , doubles , triples , etc , which is handy when booking as a single , as i often get caught - out by prices that can seem cheap , but are per_person for a double - booking ...
0	i like getting the reviews , pictures and that i only need to pay the 00 %; makes me feel more secure in my booking .
0	highly_recommended .
0	ordered timberlands and got them the next_day .
0	the fact that they gave_me texts to let_me know when the driver would be arriving was great and was given an_hour_timeslot which i got to choose so wasn_'_t waiting around all day .
0	definatley recommend
0	very helpful on the phone and by email , easy to use website
0	lovely item , arrived really quickly .
0	nicely_packaged with some amazing stickers .. will be shopping there again !
0	:)
0	great boots received quickly and at a great price .
0	what more could you want !
0	the map is a real talking_point and people always stop to take a look at it in more detail .
0	the quality of the canvas and mounting is excellent , the writing is clear and the map is educational whilst being fun .
0	the service that i received from the company was second to none .
0	i have no_hesitation in recommending this product or company to anyone_wanting a fun interesting world map .
0	this is the second time i '_ve been unfortunate_enough to be on the receiving end of a tnt delivered parcel , and both_times have been equally as disappointing .
0	each time they claim a they tried to deliver and i was not home - funny as i '_d taken time of work to wait for them - foolish i now know .
0	calling the customer helpline is of no use whatsoever ; yes they are very kind and borderline helpful in that they can tell you your order will ( yet again ) be sent out the next_day , but i '_m afraid that '_s no good when the driver doesn_'_t bother to show then claims you weren_'_t home .
0	if you ' re lucky_enough to actually receive your parcel , chances are it '_ll be in a sorry_state - everything i '_ve had from them i '_ve returned to sender , probably due to being loaded & unloaded multiple_times from the mystery delivery van ( s ) that operate through edinburgh city_centre .
0	save_yourself the hassle and don_'_t bother - unless you want to wait 0 + days for a damaged parcel to appear .
0	i '_m honestly at my wits_end with this company .
0	i bought a new build apartment in june and the supplier was first_utility .
0	i changed back to my original supplier therefore i was only with them a short while yet seem to be plagued by letters relating to an ' overdue ' ( estimated !)
0	balance on my gas account .
0	this balance is in fact false as i spoke to someone last night ( after finally getting trough ) who confirmed that they do have the correct meter_readings - to which i owe for 00 units of gas and not the 000_+ as per the estimate but couldn_'_t explain_why i '_m still being harassed by their credit control team .
0	to top it off i came home today to find yet another letter from credit control threatening court proceedings !?!
0	seriously !?!
0	the best part is - i actually emailed the credit control team last_week about this , surprise_surprise that email was ignored too , yet they managed to send me another threatening letter just the other day ..... come on guys , sort yourselves out .
0	let '_s be clear on one thing - i have no_issues in paying for what i owe , none whatsoever .
0	i just want a correct bill without the constant harassment .
0	i '_ve honestly had enough , time to see my solicitor i think .
0	the only positive thing i have to say about this company is the staff ( when you get to speak to them ) are very polite and helpful , it seems to be more their system that '_s an utter disgrace .
0	an intuitive and very well_organized layout , fast shipping , excellent customer service and the prices are extremely appealing .
0	no_doubt , i recommend this company to everyone i know .
0	the service was superb from_start to finish .
0	as a business customer we were especially impressed with the speed of the payment .
0	we couriered the package ourselves , then mazuma did the rest .
0	highly_recommended .
0	i have used amazon for a couple of years_now and over all that time and many many orders , i have never once been dissappointed !
0	the purchasing process is simple and quick , the delivery times are accurate and almost always arrive before expected which is a bonus at xmas !
0	the offer of free supersaver delivery is just fantastic and since purchasing a kindle from amazon i have been really impressed with how it works and just how lightening quick books etc are downloaded within_seconds !
0	this company is worth its weight in gold .
0	i have yet to try the selling side of amazon but i think i am sure this will also be a straightforward no - fuss procedure also !
0	will_continue to use this company long into the future !
0	i contacted pc specialists for advice after looking at their website > i didnt have a clue about megabites , ram or soundcards etc so had to put my trust into this company to make me a gaming_pc .
0	the man who i spoke to asked me various questions in otder to get an idea of what i needed and then took me ( patiently i might_add !)
0	through the various stuff i would need .
0	when he had finished i told him i would ring back after considering the quote .
0	i spoke to my children and they were really chuffed with what i had been offered as other gaming_pc '_s they had looked at on the net were far dearer_than the price i was quoted > i phoned back and bought the pc that day > following purchase , i received regular_updates_via_email as to where the pc was in the processing stages .
0	i received the pc before xmas with no_problems at all .
0	setting_up the pc was very simple ( even for me !)
0	and runs like a dream .
0	i would definately recommed pc specialists to anyone looking to purchase a pc from a friendly , helpful and patient company like this one !
0	i have very mixed_feelings regarding this company .
0	on the one hand ; the food was generally good , although the sausages were very bland .
0	on the other ; their customer service was the worst i have experienced in a long time .
0	when i placed the order , it was meant to come with a free ' naked rub ', but this did not arrive .
0	no problem , i thought , mistakes_happen .
0	so i called to let them know and request a replacement .
0	i was told that they could not send a replacement , as they only had large packing boxes , and was offered a refund of 00p as this was the price of the product .
0	however , the rub was advertised as costing 0 . 00 !
0	after a number of emails , in which i was condescended to quite badly , it turned_out that i had been lied to in the first_instance .
0	they eventually refunded 00p , as this was the price of the rub minus 00_%_off , and refused to acknowledge my complaints about their cs .
0	i know it seems silly to be bothered by such a small item and at first i thought the same , but by the time i had suffered through their customer_services , i was quite irate !
0	they were , however , very quick to refund for the low quality sausages , so i am grateful for that , and the rest of the food was very nice .
0	i have had fantastic service from this company .
0	not only do they offer competitive_prices on a wide_range of technical gear and clothing but they will go above and beyond to ensure you get exactly_what you want .
0	i have dealt_with carl in customer_services and he has_been nothing but awesome in helping_me get the right product for my needs .
0	i highly_recommend and will remain a loyal_customer for as long as their great service continues .
0	i ordered the neon pink shaker bottles as i am fed_up of my husband using all of our black ones so i haven_'_t got a clean one to use when i want .
0	i '_ve looked for ages to find ones with both screw caps and screw lids for added_security because i often take my shakes out and about and am sick of leaky containers .
0	these deluxe nutrition ones are awesome : robust , water tight and best of all ... bright_pink !
0	my husband won_'_t touch my shakers now and i love how funky they are .
0	they wash really well in the dishwasher too .
0	i '_ve_used them many_times .
0	always simple and effective
0	the website has a huge_range of foods and some great recipes to inspire you .
0	i was really impressed with the order dispatch speed , and having a choice of couriers was perfect for me .
0	many companies will not deliver to where i am on a saturday so i was happy to pay extra for royal_mail .
0	they offer easy to understand discounts and are great value for money .
0	we '_ve ordered a lot of times through mine and my partners account .
0	on 0 separate_occasions the website fell over so despite trying for over 00_minutes each time we gave up and ordered from eat .
0	we '_ve also found they add a £ 0 delivery charge on some restaurants , but if you went on the restaurants own website and ordered through there delivery is free for the same order value .
0	will keep ordering but remain cautious !
0	great clothes , great website , love my premier delivery service and great customer_care .
0	thank_you .
0	my grandmother ordered a pair of step ladders in december , the cheque she posts is cashed straight_away , one month after purchase she_receives a letter stating the ladders are not available until the 0nd week on march .
0	0nd week of march comes and goes ... no ladders .
0	the phone number on the letter and the offer strip is no_longer in use so , not having access to a computer connection , she is unable to contact them and is obviously very upset and worried .
0	after i google a new number and ring around 00 times , i get a delivery date for the following week .... low and behold they do not show .
0	after another 0_weeks the ladders arrive .
0	0_months late and guess_what ... they have pieces missing .
0	' customer service ' were rude and unhelpful and my letter of complaint has_gone unanswered .
0	diabolical all around .
0	will never ever use again .
0	quite surprised at the volume of negative_comments posted on here .
0	i have shopped with achica for around 0_months and in that time have not had any_problems , all products have been great .
0	contact to customer service was fast , easy and friendly .
0	good job guys .
0	keep it up .
0	i love the products featured on this site .
0	they mainly concentrate on home accessories that are very contemporary and colourful .
0	i had excellent customer service from this company when i enquired_about some wineracks .
0	good range of clothing , and an ok customer service .
0	i am new to using supplement_warehouse but it has_been recommended to me by friends many_times .
0	the price matching is a nice feature to have .
0	i also really enjoy getting free stuff along with my orders .
0	jv carpentry built and installed alcove storage_units for the living_room of our victorian mid - terrace .
0	they were very professional , giving us different options and making suggestions on what would look best .
0	they were flexible about when they could work to fit around us , and the guys who came to fit and paint the shelves were professional and friendly - they also tidied_up completely after themselves !
0	the units look great - and look like they could have always been there .
0	the price was very competitive and was broken down and exlplained clearly at the start of the process .
0	this company advertises items that are not even in stock .
0	i only found out that they did not have the item i paid for because i contacted them as my order was taking a long time to be processed .
0	no one bothered to contact me and no one bothers to answer the phone .... ever !
0	!
0	if you want good customer service - don_'_t use this company .
0	i had pre_- ordered a box set of prisoner cell block h and have been waiting for them to arrive i went into my local_store the other day to find them on the shelves .
0	i got an_email from them today saying they were out of stock .
0	i feel very let_down by the online service whats the point of having the pre ordering service if they don_'_t follow it through
0	i attended the complete_nail_tech_course in newcastle starting on the 00rd september .
0	my trainer was kate who was fantastic .
0	my day to day job is working as a manager of a technical testing department and i have worked their for over 00 years and attended many training_courses and kate has_been by far the best trainer .
0	kate was able to reach out to all of us .
0	our class was mixed with some ladies who had worked with gel polishes or paid for manicures and pedicures to others who had never had any of these treatments .
0	i really enjoyed working with kate as she is very enthusiastic and passionate_about her job .
0	she has the ability to to make you feel_confidant about your work as well as being_able to criticise your work but also advise you on how you can do better .
0	she was chatty and also took the time to get to get to know everyone .
0	the group i was in was a very loud group and we chatted and giggled through out the course and i was very impressed on how she was able to calm all of us down and get us to focus on the tutorials .
0	every morning kate would have a great big_smile on her face which made the course a joy to attend her classes .
0	i personally would recommend this course and kate as a trainer and i look_forward to my next course with her in the near_future .
0	i got the tigi catwalk volume shampoo , root boost and thickening gel and also the epic volume conditioner .
0	i have lots of very fine , silky and limp hair .
0	i wanted to try some products to see if i could get some good volume for my diy wedding hair .
0	i put some time aside on saturday_afternoon to use the products and style my hair , all i can say is wow !!
0	i think i was a bit heavy handed with the boost and thickener , but boy oh_boy do they work !!!
0	it '_s now tuesday pm and my hair still looks thick and has much more volume than normal .
0	plus it still looks clean too , where i would be pushing it by today if i had it au - naturel .
0	if i wasn_'_t going swimming tonight , i would be tempted to see how long the look can last .
0	only v minor_negative is that my hair isn_'_t quite as shiney .
0	great products , would definitely recommend and buy again .
0	also - the products were very quick and easy to purchase , the cheapest prices out there on these items and arrived very quickly .
0	thanks guys !
0	i have been using viovet for years and even with the new charges vets apply for prescriptions , viovet is always much_cheaper .
0	the service is great and the drugs always arrive quickly .
0	thanks viovet !
0	the service i received was exceptional and i appreciate the communication i received .
0	thank_you so much for your professionalism !
0	i will do_business again !
0	after_researching every product i wanted to buy on other_websites , i could not find anything cheaper any where and if i did , supplementwarehouse . com beat their price !
0	i have bought several domains and set_up a website via 000 - reg . co . uk .
0	the support service is great especially for someone like me who can just send emails .
0	thanks to petru
0	this is the first time i '_ve_used this company and i '_m very impressed !
0	the order itself came very quickly , and the products are perfect for a fraction of the price !
0	the customer service was great , when an item i ordered was not in stock i received an e_- mail of apology and refund the same day .
0	as well as this , any e_- mail query '_s are answered the same day which is very helpful !
0	very happy , would recommend .
0	would definatley_reccomend mazuma , did everything it said it would do on the website , in super quick time .
0	will_definatley use again !
0	we received constant progress updates on our delivery and a time_slot was given by the courier was it had been dispatched .
0	we were really happy with the service and the speed of delivery .
0	the bag we bought was cheaper here than_anywhere_else .
0	great value for money and exactly_what we wanted for holding a laptop and clothes whilst cycling to work .
0	great service and very fast delivery , no_problems_whatsoever .
0	would definitely use again and would recommend to anyone looking for cylinders
0	fantastic communication , emailed me to confimr my order , emailed me to confirm ennvelope had been sent , emailed me to inform_me they got my phone .
0	then another email to tell methey had all paid .
0	all this in the space of 0_days , would definatley use again and highly_recomend to friends
0	the items i bought worked out £_00 cheaper_than others online arrived within a few_days of ordering .
0	previously i have had huge problems with the prescription being lost , then the prescription running out , having to buy a second , playing phone tag with the customer_services etc but there was none of that .
0	clear emails let_me know when the order was sent and that the prescription had been received .
0	will use again .
0	i placed an order , within hours i was being emailed reminding_me to send the prescription , which had been sent .
0	email after email arrived , threatening to cancel the order , which they did , while all the time they had received my £_00 vets prescription !
0	had i not chased them and replaced the order my prescription would have been lost .
0	this is the senpcind year this has happened , i wonder_if it '_s worth the few_pounds i save ordering it from them ?
0	next year , i think i '_ll pay more but get it from the polite staff at the vets who speak to you rather_than fire out automated emails !
0	just completed the sage lien 00 course is easy to follow and very thorough .
0	you can revisit any sub - catagories with ease .
0	the e_- careers staff are always at hand to offer you any help .

0	bbq was 0 day late arriving due to an admin error and when finally being_able to open it discovered that the bbq had a wooden slag missing from the base .
0	i tried_phoning over the weekend after delivery to resolve the problem but couldn_'_t get through so resorted to email which got through instantly and an_automated fault / replacement case was raised for the missing part with a following email_stating case approval and dispatch in a lead time ( which i now realise is 0 - 0 working_days .
0	this part arrived a week after the bbq did , but it was the wrong part .
0	instead of a wooden slat they sent a whole wooden base .
0	once again unable to get through over the weekend i phoned first thing monday_morning when a lady assured me they would send out the correct piece as urgent and we would now have it by wednesday .
0	today is now wednesday and lo and behold no part has arrived .
0	00_mins of waiting on the phone i finally get through to parts and the man on the phone states no urgency is on the order it will be with us on friday 0_weeks since the bbq arrived .
0	i tried to ask why there was no urgency and could be clarify it was definitely the right part which he couldn_'_t .
0	i then asked to speak to a manager but they left at 0pm ...
0	so i have given up disinterested customer service employees and incompetent back of house employees .
0	i have now requested a refund but i have to wait for the bbq to be collected which will be anytime in the next 0 - 0 working_days ...... what a joke !
0	website ordering was very easy to navigate and ordering was very easy .
0	asked for next_day and i received text and email_updates to let_me know when the flowers were dispatched and when delivered !
0	extremely good service and flowers were lovely .
0	they arrived in a box which i found interesting !!
0	will order from them again !
0	i '_ve ordered sporadically from all beauty ( and before when they were known as cheap_smells ) and i really don_'_t have a single bad_word to say .
0	i ordered perfume for myself recently , it arrived well_packaged , quickly and as_described .
0	the price of the perfume was cheap and competitive , postage is free and only took a few_days , everything was a positive_experience .
0	they ' re a really great company and i '_d definitely use them again and again .
0	i never usually leave reviews , but i think the habit is to only leave one when the experience has_been a negative one .
0	having just bought an iphone_0s at the weekend from the westfield white city branch , i have no_complaints .
0	the guy_who_served me was very knowledgeable and friendly .
0	he also gave_me a discount on the handset and the phone case , which i bought there and then , as he said i was spending a lot on the price plan i ’ d chosen .
0	i wanted to transfer my current mobile number across from o0 to vodafone , he did all the necessary steps as i ’ d already got my pac_code from o0 in_advance .
0	i was a bit_weary when i got home to find out that the new vodafone simcard didn_’_t seem to have a telephone_number attached and that my new iphone was showing ‘ no service ’.
0	from previous experience of transferring my number , usually you ’ d be given a temporary mobile number , call the new network ’_s customer_services , give them your pac_code and so on .
0	perhaps because my pac_code was entered at the time of sale straight_away , this was done differently ?
0	the person serving me did suggest i buy insurance for the phone , with the first month being given free .
0	i usually don_’_t cave into these gimmicks , but when he pointed_out i had £_000 worth of technology in my hand , it did make me think .
0	he advised i could cancel it within a month , which i probably will do and perhaps look for something cheaper .
0	but overall , i ’_m pleased to say that 0_days_later ( not including the 0 day weekend !
0	), i am now a vodafone customer and the whole_process was a smooth journey .
0	the transfer time did take longer_than_expected , but that ’_s not a fault of carphone_warehouse .
0	i would certainly advise to take the negative_reviews with a pinch of salt .
0	had a faulty car from there took them 0_days to take the car in and fix but they did fix it eventually ... beware and always check the car your thinking of buying
0	i was intending on booking 0 night in a hostel in a dorm room and then 0 night in a private_room at the same hostel the following night .
0	i found this hard to do and couldn_'_t really see an easy way of doing this on the website .
0	also when i paid for the room i thought i would automatically be signed_up to hostel_bookers website but i wasn_'_t i just had made booked and not created an account .
0	however - really good variety and other that than it is easy to use .
0	insurance , breakdown_cover , utilities etc are all so boring to search for to get a good price , so when i saw this site i was very surprised .
0	i landed on a comparison table , it told me what i got for my money , how much it would cost , and what special_offers i could get and within 00_minutes of searching , i got a fantastic offer .
0	i wish everything else was as easy , can you not make a car insurance page like this ?
0	i think a lot of people would use it .
0	i sent in my iphone_0s 00gb with an estimated value price of £_000 .
0	i then received a revised_offer from bozowi of £_000 with them stating : ' engineers have tested your phone and have found that your phone has a significant scratches on the unit or screen that does not meet the minor wear and tear criteria .
0	we therefore offer you the revised price below for your phone .'
0	there were most definitely not ' significant scratches ' on the phone .
0	but that '_s fine if they think that , so i rejected the offer to get the phone returned to me .
0	this was on the 0th_february - 00 days ago .
0	i have since received no communication from them , i have sent 0 emails - the most_recent stating if i do not receive some form of communication from them i will resort to taking further_action .
0	i am unable to telephone them as their working hours are finished before mine are .
0	and just to clarify , i check my junk email everyday as well - it hasn_'_t slipped into there either !
0	would never recommend or use this company for their sheer lack of incompetence and poor customer service .
0	so bozowi , if you are reading this - i hope this will prompt you to respond and finally return my phone , or revise my offer to the original price you offered .
0	then maybe we can finally get this matter resolved without having to take it further :)
0	--- update ---
0	since writing this review i have been contacted by bozowi , who apparently have not received any of my emails due to a server issue .
0	because of my unhappy review my phone has_been placed in quarantine until my complaint has_been resolved .
0	i was asked to take this review down , however i have refused and said i will update my review accordingly .
0	upon updating this review i will be receiving a revised phone price , and if i accept this will be paid into my bank_account the same day .
0	this has_been a long_drawn_out process , however it looks like i will finally get a resolution , and i am finally happy with the outcome .
0	for this reason i have changed my star_rating from 0 to 0 .
0	as although they may have had issues with their emails , it should still be understood that the level of communication is considered to be unacceptable .
0	-- further update --
0	after a promise that my money would be with me the next_day after i had updated my review , i received nothing .
0	the next_day i sent yet again another email to be told that they had been out of the office the previous day and hadn_'_t come in until late the day after that .
0	why tell me that everything would be sorted the day after our phone_call then !?
0	it is now sunday , almost 0 week after being told i would receive my money and still nothing .
0	i am completely and utterly fed_up now and will be refusing to update this review again .
0	this is an absolutely awful company , who lies and does not keep to promises and has no urgency whatsoever about them .
0	i recently sent a different phone to <_external link_removed_> and received payment into my account 0_days_later , no_hassles .
0	it has_been almost a month now .
0	- further update -
0	have since been contacted by a management member , the original member of staff dealing_with ( or not dealing_with ) my query quit , i was offered the full phone price and it was paid into my bank_account the next_day .
0	thanks to <_private data_removed_> who finally_managed to help me in this ridiculous situation , i am now happy that this has all been resolved and i can forget about this horrible_experience !
0	i recently booked a flight with bravofly from belfast to barcelona and broke up with my boyfriend so called up to change the name on the ticket .
0	the woman on the other end of the phone took_ages to understand what i wanted to do because she clearly did not speak_english and she then preceeded tospell the name change incorrectly .
0	when i tried to tell her this she simply ignored me or did not udnerstand me and told me i would get a confirmation_email soon .
0	i waited on the email to prove she had spelt the name wrong but the email did not come .
0	i called again and got the same person .
0	she laughed at me and told me " jus to wait " and that i have " plenty of time ".
0	what sort of customer service is that ?
0	ryanair who everyone complain_about did the name change straight_away and nobody laughed at me .
0	also they did add a lot of charges onto the original fee .
0	never ever go with this company !
0	they have absolutely no customer service !
0	was so impressed with the level of privacy , the speed in which it arrived and i received results .
0	doctors replied quickly .
0	i have been using liz_earle products for just over a year now and i can_honestly_say that they have made so much difference to my skin !
0	everyone should use the cleanse & polish - it is a real lifesaver .
0	the service is amazing too , the online advisor is so helpful and my orders always arrive promptly , beautifully_packaged and with lovely personal_touches :-) thank_you le !
0	myself and a friend booked a spa day through this company .
0	we got an_email 0_days before telling us they ' could not fulfil our request '.
0	i called the hotel and they had us booked in for nearly a month later than agreed .
0	called wahanda and was told ' your call is now next in the queue ' over and over again for over 00_mins before i was hung_up on .
0	called again and stayed on hold for 00_mins before being told it was cancelled .
0	never again .
0	ordered and received very quickly .
0	was impressed at the speed and price .
0	would use again !
0	this is the second time i '_ve_used glasses0you and again i '_m not disappointed .
0	the website offers lots of options and for me being_able to see the exact_measurements of glasses and filter by size , shape etc .
0	means it '_s easy to find suitable glasses for me .
0	it '_s more accurate and has more choice than the high_street .
0	the returns guarantee means you cannot go_wrong and if in need of assistance the staff have always been helpful .
0	saying that i '_ve not had to exchange any of the glasses i '_ve ordered .
0	i '_ll definitely be back to glasses0you .
0	it was easy to navigate_around the website , everything was clear and the order process was efficient and easy .
0	as such i have been using get lenses for years and have never had a problem .
0	i loved my lovefilm subcription before greedy amazon took over !
0	i paid £ 0 . 00 a month and i got my lovefilm instant and my lovefilm by post .
0	i didn_'_t even realise that anything would change when amazon took over as they told me nothing was changing but the name , what a load of bull .
0	i had to email them several_times before they clearly told me that i would be expected to pay £_00 for amazon_prime for the year otherwise i couldn_'_t get instant video anymore .
0	i don_'_t know about anyone_else but i don_'_t have that kind of money to just fork_out .
0	absolutely ridiculous .
0	don_'_t fix something that '_s not broken !!!
0	!
0	ali was a star in helping_me get ready for google ad words exams as well as some really helpful tips in regards to conversion rate optimisation .
0	i was a little_nervous of ordering online .
0	advice i can give other people .
0	have an up to date prescription and measurement of pupil_distance .
0	it may help to measure your previous glasses too for the right lens size .
0	i received my glasses yesterday and can see clearly with them no troubles .
0	the glasses fit like a glove .
0	the service is very good .
0	thank_you so much .
0	def recommend and buy again great service and value
0	i have shopped quite a lot on boohoo and i have to say it '_s my favourite for value fir money , style ideas , availability , variety and service so quick you almost need to be ready to answer the door as soon as you place your order .
0	my 00 year_old daughter just got a little part time job and now i have another boohooer at home lol .
0	fully recommend to everyone everywhere .
0	never had a problem thanks boohoo xx
0	found them to be cheaper_than stores selling similar products on a number of prodecuts and delivery was really quick .
0	i just bought a french style chateau bed at half the price of my local furniture shop , has just been delivered and assembled in my bedroom and it looks beautiful .
0	this was great service , the price was fanatastic & the service even better .
0	thanks so much !

0	i love using hostelbookers for any travelling i do .
0	with all of their ratings and reviews they make it so easy to find safe , clean and fun accommodation pretty_much anywhere you could wish to go .
0	i always feel safe booking with hostelbookers knowing i can cancel my stay if my plans change , which they often do , and they allow you to pay upon_arrival giving you plenty of change to get your funds sorted !
0	couldn_'_t ask for more !
0	great company very friendly staff this is the only place i go to for all my e_cig products would definitely recommend to all my friends and family
0	service was excellent !
0	any_queries i sent through were answered quickly .
0	they helped_me with my print and to get it sent internationally which was above and beyond what they needed to do which was very much_appreciated .
0	quality of the canvas was great .
0	definitely recommend to others , i '_ve_used this company twice_now and both with great results and customer server and would not_hesitate to use again .
0	really easy to do , simple process , fast payment , recommend :)
0	ordered some wedding day and evening_invitations , came and marriage was mispelt , a slight typo_error and apparantly they dont read what they are going to print !
0	cause you think they would have noticed and done a nice thing by asking us are you sure this is what you want , if they had pointed_out the mistake ( which you think they would ) they could have said oops slight mistake and corrected for us .
0	but they just printed and said its our fault and want to charge all over again , even when the evening_invites were not the colour we requested !
0	when we contacted them by phone customer service were really unhelpful , and couldnt seem to make their minds up on whether they did read the proofs or not ?
0	which you think they would to help people find mistakes like that ?
0	honestly thought that would be part of the service regardless of if you typed them yourself , were not professionals and they are supposed to be ?
0	fab service , fast delivery fab cond , would recommend and now check ere for things i need before i go_anywhere_else , they keep you so well informed about progress of your order etc xx
0	superb prices , brilliant customer service ..
0	simple , easy website ..
0	spoken to katie today as i had trouble loging in and she had sorted everything out in no time !
0	well_done and thank_you parcel0go !

0	excellent good quality items , and fast delivery , thanks very much
0	i receieved my shower and called my plumber out to fit it , only to find i had the wrong one , i emailed bella bathroom to see if i could send it back to them - they said no , as i had recieved it 0_days ago , and that they only refund on goods that are received within 0_days !
0	so i asked if they would exchange the shower , they said no and attatched the delivery note with a signature !
0	the customer service with this company have no_intention of helping you !
0	they have lost at_least one good customer :-(
0	i always use serenata to order flowers for friends and relatives .
0	not only are their costs extremely competitive , they are extraordinarily reliable and offer next_day delivery .
0	i have never been disappointed by their service - always arriving on time and delivered by very competent and pleasant people .
0	the flowers are also very beautiful and i have always had comments from recipients about how lovely the flowers are and how long they last .
0	i recommend serenata regularly to my friends and would use the service again and again .
0	my only comments would be 0 ) to add more design options for personalised_cards and messages and 0 ) to maybe have an option for a sunday delivery - this is something offered by very few online flower delivery services and i think this would set serenata apart_from competitors if they could offer this service .
0	perhaps just on certain sundays ?
0	such as mothering_sunday ?
0	great service as of yet when i '_ve ordered what i '_ve ordered it has_been sent as soon as possible which i find great
0	i had an old phone that had been in a draw for months i checked the price online and was very happy .
0	i sent the phone off on the friday and had the cash in my bank on the wednesday ! they offer you a good price even if your phone is broken everything on there website is easily_accessible and you can track your order . have used them before and will do so again !
0	!
0	first_class product , easy to access first_class service
0	this was the third time i have used your site to book a hostel and i have never been disappointed .
0	i find your site easy to use and very informative !
0	the items item the day after i ordered them even thought i went for the free standard delivery option .
0	items were exactly as_described and wrapped - a nice_touch !
0	would highly_recommend the website to anyone who '_s looking for a friendly and efficient service .
0	one very happy customer .
0	i was recommended by a friend tot his company , and i was pleased with the result .
0	i received a beautiful canvas for a great price and the customer service was both efficient and friendly .

0	i use it for my old girl who '_s 00 and still enjoys her daily_walks
0	very easy process , would recommend
0	my payment cleared very slowly ( despite sending it straight_away ) and they were very polite and understanding about the delay .
0	the items were exactly as_described and arrived very quickly .
0	i recieved notification of the day my order would arrive .
0	can '_t fault this company and will definitely use their services again !
0	i have ordered a few things from this site now and have always been pleased with my purchases .
0	the delivery is always quick and it is good value for money .
0	this rating would have been a 0 if it wasn_'_t for the fact half the things i like sell out quickly .
0	there are previews on facebook the day before things go on sale and they go on sale between 00 - 00 the next_day .
0	however , if like me you work and are unable to sit on the site at the exact time they go on sale you usually miss out on the best stuff .
0	there is no limit to the amount of each item you can buy so bulk buyers buy the best things immediately to sell at a profit .
0	this seems to be provided as feedback regularly but nothing is ever done .
0	this is the only_thing letting this site down .
0	excellent range of high_quality items and at a good price too .
0	reasonably fast delivery but have had quicker for less money .
0	website easy to use and easy to order .
0	i ordered a ps0_game for my partners_birthday .

0	i have used partyrama before and had no_problems ; however this time was a totally different_story .
0	i received a call on my phone from a number i did not recognise .
0	on answering the call i was informed by a gentleman that he had been delivered my deliver .
0	the box had been addressed to him however my invoice and items that i had ordered were inside the box .
0	the gentleman_who received the box had my invoice details which include my contact number , payment details and home address .
0	i am luck that the gentleman was honest enough to call me and explain the situation .
0	upon_calling partyrama '_s customer service , although the customer advisor was helpful , she did not apologise for the mistake once .
0	this all happened on 0th_may and i am still_waiting for the items to be delivered .
0	since 0th_may i have had no communication from partyrama and we are now on 00th_may .
0	i accept mistakes_happen , however i believe the situation has_been dealt_with appallingly .
0	i had a canon_000d bought recently but i didn_'_t use very much .
0	i was thinking to sell but wasn_'_t sure the best way to do it .
0	i read some positive_reviews about mpb and decided to take the plunge .
0	it was an immense delight !
0	everything worked_perfectly fast .
0	the contact , the quotation , the delivery , the payment .
0	certainly i will recommend to friends !
0	i booked 0 nights in " escape hostel " in lagos , and they cancelled my reservation cause they had an inspection and they had to close the hostel .
0	they charged the full_amount of the reservation , i '_m trying to get my money back but i have no answer .

0	i made a mistake with the postage so had to call up .

0	i like this company / website '_s service .
0	quick delivery and cheaper_than other online contact_lenses shops .
0	the website is easy to use and i found what i was looking for at a much_better price than id seen_elsewhere .
0	i was kept up to date with emails as the order was processed .
0	it did arrive a day or so later than_expected but it had come from guernsey so i don_'_t mind .
0	will use again !
0	the watch shop had all the watches i had looked at on other_sites but at lower prices .
0	i struggled to find a watch big enough for my boyfriend but when i contact the watch shop they got back to me the next_day to say they could make any watch bigger at no extra_cost , they also provided a link to search_results filtered to the description i said i was looking for .
0	i ordered the watch on a sunday_evening and even_though the size was being increased i received the watch on tuesday_morning , and even received update_emails at every_stage .
0	i honestly can '_t fault the service in any way .
0	easily found what i wanted at a lower price than most other_places , quick and easy checkout and quick delivery .
0	will use again :)
0	wow !
0	this delivered fast and was cheaper !
0	really recommend this site :))
0	such a fast service so so so surprised .
0	easy to navigate site with super speedy dispatch - my order arrived the next_day sensibly_packaged .
0	excellent service , having been a sum what novice i rang modelsport on a few occasions , all staff i spoke to had a very friendly and professional_manner , who helped_me in making the right choice for my son , who is thrilled to bits with his new speed passion !!
0	thanks alot will be defo coming_back .
0	i recently received a very generous sample of the enliven shower_gel and was pleasantly_surprised to find the fragrance very pleasant , not too over powering and long_lasting .
0	i have quite sensitive_skin but had no_problems using this product .
0	i was impressed by the nice lather it made .
0	i would be happy to but this product as you wouldn_'_t need to use much , making it rather good value for money .
0	if i could give zero_stars i would .
0	i very very rarely have anything to complain_about but have to warn_people before using approved , i started off as an_avid fan , filling my cupboards for incredibly low costs .
0	the delivery charge is actually quite reasonable when you realise how much you can get and the choice and quality was very good .
0	however and this is the bit people should be careful of ..... i made my third order a few_days ago and looked forward to the swift delivery , when it arrived , i discovered a very badly packed , well should i say not packaged at all , bottle of bubble bath had leaked over a large_quantity of of my items .
0	when i contacted them , initially waited along time for a response but after messaging on fb , a gentlemen got back to me saying they were under staffed .
0	he promised to refund me due to having to clean everything and the bottle being damaged .
0	i had this in writing and photographs of the incident .
0	however a day later i was then informed that they were no_longer doing this and had to review my photos with the manager , they refused to refund unless they took all the items back and then decided if to refund .
0	so because of there mistake i would end up with no shopping and a possible refund in over a weeks time , if they decided ????
0	this is crazy .
0	after numerous_emails etc , i have given up .
0	they are obviously very under staffed and have a poor or should i say non_existent return_policy .
0	:-( now they just wont contact me back and have ignored my messages .
0	i have been on diet_chef for a while and planning on stopping this due to fact that i have felt ill consistently since been on this .
0	yes the food is tasty , yes it is convenient , yes i have lost_weight but my warning is , it just isnt possible to stay on it as long as it states .
0	the only way i have even felt human most days is to eat a lot of fruit and veg .
0	i expected to add some but this is ridiculous .
0	im not even that big and im nearly passing out .
0	plus i still had to calorie_count any way as your snacks are not labeled clearly .
0	had to weigh all fruit , veg , measure milk so to be honest i might as well cook my owneals and save my self a fortune .
0	if you are the sort of person_who_likes fad diets , living off liquids and spending a fortune for the privalidge , try this !
0	my one honest tip is , this is not special amazing food , it is stuff you can make a lot tastier and cheaper , it is just smaller_portions .
0	plus having that many snacks in house at once was just a massive temptation .
0	would buy from here such good standard of products 😃
0	loved my fancy_dress outfit and can not wait to wear it :-)
0	i couldn_'_t_believe_how cheap the books are on here , so cheap too , and the site keeps you informed at every_stage of your order .
0	i love the layout , so simple and if you are unsure of the full title the search_function is a must
0	brilliant customer support , the site has everything all in one place , much_cheaper_than_anywhere_else in most_cases and the returns_policy is so straightforward , i continue to use amazon for most of my online purchases .
0	the site is so easy to navigate and the delivery men are always friendly and chatty , they take the time to explain the substitutes ( if any ) and make_sure we are happy before they leave us .
0	i really recommend asda , tesco quality has_gone down in the last couple of years yet their prices have gone up and up , with asda the quality is amazing and the prices are brilliant .
0	a *
0	the customer service centre is run from india who i can '_t understand , the gimmick is you can order up to 0pm the day before but they never have delivered it the next_day , i normally have to chase it up .
0	i may be unlucky but we have the most unsociable , ruse , tactless milkman ever who should definitely not be working with the public .
0	a disgusting ' service ', even the £_00 off won_'_t make me return ( unless they sort their staff out ).
0	we recently_moved way out , no transport after a certain time so just - eat is great !
0	the reviews are clear so you see a new place at a glance , and the online order process is both easy and safe !
0	in the past when i had one bad_experience with one restaurant , they did all they could to make it right for me , i would recommend them to anyone :)
0	i have ordered several_times from this site and while i can '_t fault the prices , i don_'_t like the fact they will buy things as f grade and sell them on as a or b !!!!
0	also they maintain they normally send items the same day ... that has never happened to me infact i am_currently_waiting for some dvds that have been in the ' stock pickingin progress ' stage for 0_days .
0	i didn_'_t experience problems like one reviewer thoughwho didn_'_t receive accessories with a phone , i did , but here is a company that definitely does lack in a few areas .
0	site is easy to use and found everything i needed really quickly - ordered thursday , received next_day !
0	something_else i really liked - i prefer to use paypal for my online purchases nowadays for security , especially if i don_'_t know the company from name / experience - they not only offer paypal , but also google wallet which i '_ve been meaning to try , so definitely will use again !
0	i love ann_summers products and we have spent alot with them over the years but i wont_be shopping with them again , the customer service is getting worse and the returns process is just too long !
0	i purchased an item in october and decided to wear to for the first time on new years_eve , it was a lovely slip which made everything look fantastic - well for 0 hours til the strap snapped and i had to return home to change !
0	i returned the item on jan 0th , after emailing them since the 0st jan and finally getting a reply on the 0th asking me to send it in to them .
0	its now jan 00th and i still have no refund !
0	it was apparently processed on the 00th but im yet to see it !
0	i returned another item on the 00th and thats not even been processed yet !
0	ann_summers is great if you get a good product that fits well and doesnt break but the chances are it will be too small or poor quality and then you ` ll have to fight to get your money back !
0	not good ann_summers !!
0	ill be shopping elsewhere from now on - its time you realised theres alot of competition out there now and you need to step up your game !!!
0	!
0	if you need something sorting the details on here seem to be the best option , email sent - immediate_reply !
0	fingers_crossed this will go somewhere now !
0	i use parcel0go alot , have done for about 0 years_now and they have always been wonderful !
0	lots of choice , discount_codes , fab service and a company you can_trust !
0	most packages arrive on time if not early and safe .
0	i have found out today that a package has_been lost by the courier , parcel0go sorted this in just 00_mins !!!
0	i used live_chat to ask where the item was and was told it looked like it was misplaced and given a link to a form to fill , i filled and sent this back online instantly and was offered a refund moments later to the value of the goods plus the postage .
0	very very happy with the fast effective service and will_continue to use !
0	!
0	thanks so much for unlocking my iphone0s !
0	i '_m from the caribbean and i had gotten the iphone_0s sprint usa ...
0	i had tried different_ways of unlocking my phone and even ordered the gevy sim and jail broke it too ..... then i came_across you guys !
0	i was skeptical at first but after_reading all the reviews here and on facebook , i told myself these_guys have to be legit and i have the feeling that they can unlock my phone .
0	so i had pre_- ordered my unlock to get in the queue and within 0 week i got notification that i can complete my order for the unlock ..
0	i finished ordered my unlock and today 0 week_later i finally got the message that my phone was unlocked ....
0	my phone was jailbroken so i had to restore and upgrade and i smiled sooooooo much when i saw my country '_s carrier showing on my phone !!
0	:))) you guys delivered on your word that you do unlock iphones !
0	some get it right away , some wait a few_days or 0_weeks or more , but i can guarantee that these_guys can do the job !
0	if they can unlock my phone , they can unlock any other iphone !
0	:))) you just need to have a little patience and it will get done !
0	:)))
0	now i can use my phone as a phone and not just use it as a game console or music player ..
0	thanks so much again guys .. will definitely recommend !!!
0	:))) you rock !!

0	using hostelbookers was probably the easiest booking experience i have ever had .
0	they list all your options in a full graphic menu making it super simple to pick and choose between establishments , and prices are upfront and fair .
0	i love the extensive user reviews each_hostel has and that there are photos of what the rooms look like .
0	all in all it '_s a breeze to navigate and i will be coming_back for future_bookings .
0	the site compares all deals so you get the best offer and then routes you straight through to buy .
0	it has pay as you go phones at £ 0 . 00 which was great cos i needed something cheap .
0	a +++
0	has a great section on free phone and free line rental , easy to find the best phone deal on one site with all the facts .
0	excellent customer service and excellent product .
0	i will definitely come_back again for future frame purchases from picture gallery uk .
0	reasonable_price with high_quality product .
0	highly_recommended .
0	very good cust service and will_defo recommend this website to friends .....
0	shoetique is user_friendly website .
0	i can simply find shoe based on the brand or by specific sort .
0	i would definitely recommend this to all my friends .
0	i wish you could add more choices for each brand .
0	but so far , i am very delighted shopping online through shoetique .
0	keep_up the good work !
0	i like that hostelbookers is so neatly organized in three tabs - that way i always know where to find the information i am tipically looking for .
0	i love that maps and streetview is integrated in the page !
0	the miniatures are perfect and i loved how you could choose as many or as little of each as you required .
0	the packaging was excellent , well_protected and delivery time was great .
0	i also really appreciated the email when i wasn_'_t sure of the date of delivery .
0	i was very impressed with how much care had been taken to bubble_wrap everything .
0	i don_'_t understand the negative_comments on here , this company has_been great !
0	they don_'_t really have the same online deals like they have in the shop and they are getting soo tight with some of the contracts
0	on the primark website you cant really see there range of clothes .
0	which i think is useless .
0	what if people wanna do their shopping online and they want to use primark ?
0	they need to step it up !
0	!
0	everything is easy to find on the website .
0	they were fast with the delivery .
0	nothing had been open like when i '_ve ordered products off other_websites .
0	i '_ve had no_problems with the products .
0	payment plans make everything easy
0	this company not only matches competitors ' prices but then gives a discount .
0	great inventory of different products as well .
0	i '_m a fairly new player on tombola ... only really been playing it for about 0 month on and off and have always enjoyed_playing regardless of win or no win !
0	it '_s a site that you gamble on and can '_t always expect to win .... but the saying goes you have to be in it to win it and that '_s what i remember when i don_'_t win !
0	rather_than mock others for their good luck .... yes sometimes people win more than once but so do people at the normal bingo hall bingos ... it '_s the luck of the draw .
0	i would definitely recommend tombola to anyone ... great to play when your out / in / inbed / sickofthehubby / inthebath / ontheloo haha it '_s so easy to play on my phone and i do love tombola
0	keep_up the good work and feel free to pop my name into the winners machine since so many think it '_s a fix lol ( 0leafclovers ) jokes
0	in all seriousness 00 / 00 for site only_criticism is the music that plays when people win needs updated it '_s so irritating and old_fashioned .... nice big happy tune :-) i tend to play on mute for that reason
0	laura xx
0	perfect .
0	great value for money .
0	i bought nikon dslr_camera with complete package .
0	quick and safe delivery .
0	i have chosen you after checking and reviewing many other online shopping sites for a few_weeks ..
0	thank_you .
0	i am happy with dealing_with you
0	it was good experience and i will purchasing again from you organization
0	thanks a lot

0	i got my north_face coat £_00 cheaper_than i '_d found it anywhere_else .
0	ordered it on tuesday night and it was delivered on thursday , even_though i picked free delivery that could have taken between 0 and 00 days .
0	in perfect_condition , very fast delivery , would definitely recommend .
0	after trying to get beyoncé tickets for how many_years_now , i '_ve finally got 0 tickets ...
0	if only i knew about this website before i could have seen her a few_times .
0	beyoncé was sold out in minutes yet again & to be honest i want taking no 0 an answer .
0	i came_across this website & ordered tickets that were block 0 & guaranteed to be the 0st 00 rows from the front .. received rows j & k and they are rows 0 & 00 from the stage according to the plan ... so i am well chuffed ... granted the tickets are nearly double the price of the face value ( well in my case they were ) but to me it worth it better_than not going & some ppl are charging the same price i paid for a standing seat .. will do_business again & thanks ...
0	i purchased a product on 00 / 00 /_0000 and to this date ( 0 / 00 / 00 ) have still not received my product .
0	i contacted beautybay and they informed that i needed to contact my national post service however as i was not provided with a tracking_number the national post service could not do anything about it .
0	i contacted customer service several more times for more information about how i can track my order yet have had no feedback whatsoever .
0	i am disappointed with the service of beautybay
0	couldn_'_t fault this company at all .
0	they were brilliant from_start to finish - i '_d definitely use again and recommend to others !
0	always fast , reliable delivery with excellent prices on goods .
0	the sale_section is amazing !
0	!
0	easy to find the phone , helpful instructions .
0	the envelope arrived the next_day , it was strong_enough to hold the 0 old_phones i sent off .
0	i recieved an e_- mail the day after i sent the phones off just saying my phones had been recieved and to expect payment in the next two_days .
0	i choose to give my bank details and sure enough two_days_later the money was in my bank .
0	if you do not want to give your bank details there is the option to just get a cheque sent to you , but as you can guess it would take longer to get the money .
0	all in all it was every quick and easy to do and if i will no_doubt do it again when i get a new phone .
0	great service . very efficient and helpful . would highly_recommend to others
0	orderd starwars 00 day time card had a problem with my mail live help sorted it in 0 min will be coming again
0	many thx
0	hostelbookers always helps me find the best value hostel for whatever destination i '_m headed to .
0	i used the website for my first few trips , and now i refuse to use another service .
0	i went to tesco express in petersfield and there was a staff_member called michael he was very helpful and polite he took me straight to the product i was looking for even carried the iterm as well that guy should get a bonus for being so kind
0	i '_ve had nothing but excellent service from this company .
0	the products are high_quality , well - selected and helpfully reviewed , delivery is 0 - 0_days ( courier is especially good , when you order compressed gas items ), loyalty_points and discount days are much_appreciated and they ' re very approachable if there '_s a problem .
0	easy to use website , very quick delivery , good quality products , very reasonably_priced
0	i ordered 0 items on 0th_september ; the website advised there was a 0 week wait for 0 of the items and the whole delivery would be sent at the same time .
0	0nd_october nothing , so sent an_email , 0th_october no response to the email , called the free phone number ( 00000 000 000 ) but was a dead tone , had to call the 0000 number only to get through to a voicemail , 0th_october call was returned with voicemail left advising supplier delay no further details .
0	00th_october still absolutely nothing , no delivery , no email giving an update !!!
0	eventually after chasing via_email again i was advised by a customer service advisor on 00 / 00 that my delivery would arrive on friday 00st_october only to get another email 00th_october to be told 0 of the items would not be delivered ... cue yet another email to ' customer_services ' to be told the item was ' damaged in the warehouse ' and have now been told i can expact another few_weeks wait .
0	how difficult is it to send 0 items in the post or at_least have continuity in information .
0	i completely understand that things get delayed but what '_s so difficult with telling your customers .
0	over 0_weeks from order to delivery is ridiculous , without chasing i would not have had a clue what was going on .
0	would it be so difficult to send an_automated email to advise of supplier issues just to let customers know or is it too much_trouble for petplanet to keep their customers advised as to what is going on with the products they have paid for .
0	above all , as one of the other_reviewers mentions , why not just use basic business sense and keep all the items in stock by stock checking !
0	!
0	i have used petplanet before and encountered much the same issues , albeit not quite the same delivery wait but the customer service provided is all the proof i need to not order use petplanet again .
0	handepay has helped my business succeed .
0	if your business is small or big , i was strongly advice you go with handepay .
0	i was dealt_with mark martin and he was friendly , professional and helped with any_problems i had .
0	it was easy and simple to order and receive my terminal .
0	i would advice all businesses to attend with handepay as you will receive the best offers , rates and professional service that you will require .
0	low_prices , always super speedy delivery and brilliant customer_services .
0	i am a regular customer and recommend to everyone !
0	the quality was good and as_described .
0	surprised to find a 0_months warranty on a refurbished mobile .
0	i '_ve booked lots of hostels with hostelbookers since it '_s easier than other_websites i '_ve tried .
0	you can browse hostels in an area by price , and it even shows you the separate prices for private and shared rooms which is really useful for finding a good deal .
0	all details of the hostels are shown so you know exactly_what they offer and what you get for your money .
0	paying is also fast and simple , and you can pay most of it to the hostel on arrival in case you need to make_changes .
0	overall , a very user - friendly site !
0	i love supplementalwarehouse . com because they have the lean efx supplements at the cheapest price i have ever_seen .
0	they are very reliable and the free gifts and merchandise are a great way to please the customer !
0	i understand_why the shipping is so much but at_least the free items make up for that cost and the cheap price of the item itself !
0	i ordered three onesies and paid for next - day delivery ( which was at half price - amazing ).
0	items arrived_safely and on time and my children have hardly taken their onesies off since christmas day .
0	thank_you boohoo !
0	love this site .
0	easy to find what i '_m looking for , great layout with pics , ratings and list of ammenities , also very easy to make a payment .
0	i love that it told me there were only two spaces left in the dorm i was looking at .
0	the juicer is very practical , not too_big or heavy , just enough ... works_fine and we enjoy juices and pulp as well ..
0	couldn_'_t be better
0	perfect customer service ... and express delivery even on christmas time ... definetly recomended
0	i was able to take my parcel to a shop near work and drop it off .
0	the company received it in good time without_any hitches or problems .
0	it was also the cheapest option for me .
0	would use them again .
0	hostelbookers is a very easy and convenient site to use .
0	they give great traveler reviews and rating and charge no booking_fees .
0	glasses are fab , prices that could not be_beaten and best customer service experience i have came_across in a long time .
0	third time i have used health spark as as always kept up to date on order progress with emails .
0	goods received within a few_days .
0	customer discounts great , i always recommend to friends and i will be a returning_customer time & time again !
0	lynne
0	booked tickets to newcastle and back for a friends 00th ( four of us ).
0	got there okay but when we were going to return to london , we noticed some tickets missing ......
0	with over 00_minutes to spare , i was in no panic , i was sure that this could be sorted_out so we ambled over to the travel centre to explain , they asked for the seat_numbers ( we had two , two were missing ) so we checked the original e_- mail which read no reserved_seats , despite us having two at_least !
0	the lady at the travel centre said that there was nothing she could do and it was the choo choo trainline '_s responsibility .
0	fair_enough , we called them .
0	" you should have checked the tickets " was their excuse .
0	maybe so , but have you seen the amount of tickets they send you ?
0	receipts , reservation numbers , actual tickets , probably some shakin ' steven '_s concert_tickets in there as well .
0	" well it '_s too late for that now , can you kindly send the reference_number over so we can get the tickets re - printed and leave byker grove to return to good ole london town ?"
0	in short - no .
0	i was put through to about 00 different people who were just as rude as the last .
0	i was given their customer service number to ring .
0	" can you just transfer the call ?"
0	don_'_t be silly that would be far too simple .
0	why did they not want to transfer the call ?
0	because , as i discovered when i actually called it , it was flipping shut !
0	i called them again , they said they '_d put me through to someone_who could help .
0	who was it ?
0	east_coast !
0	who we already knew had nothing to do with this !!
0	!
0	we obviously missed our train , we asked them to transfer our tickets .
0	would they ?
0	is the pope a muslim ?
0	the amount of time we spent on the phone to this sad excuse of a company i should have just paid the £_000_pound each they wanted for new tickets .
0	( we originally paid £_00 )
0	they wouldn_'_t help , they didn_'_t care that we were stranded with hardly_any money , families to return home to and it was all their fault .
0	in the end we had to get the coach home .
0	i cannot even begin to remind myself of the terror of that journey ...............
0	in short , the trainline are a disgusting company .
0	they are foul .
0	they suck .
0	the customer service obviously don_'_t know the meaning of the words " customer service "
0	the whole company deserves to catch syphilis and then go to hell and be locked in a flaming hot cell with adolt hitler , fred west and jimmy saville .
0	be assured that i will spread the word and i spread it damn good .
0	it was my little_boys christening sunday 0th_may_0000 , we hired james from mobile disco wirral and what a great choice we made , fab play list songs suitable for all ages , brilliant with the kids they didnt sit_down all day he had them doing dancing compititions pass the parcel musical statues and many more party favourites he even managed 0 get few adults involved in the games , everyone commmented on how much fun they had had , such a reasonable_price aswell as i had tried a few different places and was quoted far more then i could ever afford , was nice 0 still have the entertainment we wanted at such fair prices , james was very friendly and very professional , i would definately recommend him and will_definately be using him again next time i have a party 😃 he made what was already a fabulous day even better by keeping all the children smilling from ear to ear .

0	i '_ve always received really good quality products in a good time , with parcel tracking too !
0	i can_honestly_say there has only been one time that i had a problem ( a wrong item was sent in error ), i rang the customer service number and was told that i would be sent an envelope to return the item free of charge and then the correct one would be sent .
0	the customer service staff are really nice and very helpful , and i '_ve honestly never had an issue trying to get through on the phone .
0	the only possible downside i can think of is that things do sell out very quickly but it '_s not a major_issue as there is always new things being added to the site the next_day .
0	overall , e0p is a fantastic company providing good quality items at an amazing price , which , let '_s face it , is what we all need at the moment !
0	:-)
0	hostelbookers is a really helpful website which is really easy to use .
0	it has a great range of information about the hostels including coherent and trustworthy reviews and photographs .
0	happy booking and exploring !
0	i found what i wanted and it was the cheapest price on any website and also came with free delivery .
0	i couldn_'_t have asked for more !
0	i use viovet regulary to buy cat_food .
0	they are the cheapest around for what i want and they always deliver exactly when they say they are going to .
0	couldn_'_t ask for more .
0	arrived in time for a birthday_gift , items reasonably_priced and arrived well_packaged .
0	great seller
0	my clarisonic mia arrived quickly , was well - packaged and the whole_transaction was seamless .
0	recommended seller !
0	overskuelig hjemmeside og god , hurtig_levering .
0	no_complains what so ever !
0	the kigs were great and so was the delivery .
0	the website itself is laid_out nicely and easy to use .
0	you can also use paypal which is something i like from websites as like most people i don_'_t like putting my credit details on any site .
0	the delievery was fast , i ordered on a sunday and it arrived tuesday_morning .
0	the product was perfect and i also got the pre order edition even_though i didn_'_t pre order which was nice .
0	the website provides cheap games in hard_copy which is much_better_than buying a digital code for more money .
0	i would recommend , and i will buy from them again .
0	exeter printing . com is simply the best - and not just the best printing company ; i '_d go as far as to say they ' re one of the best companies is exeter full stop !
0	they offer fantastic customer service , speed and top quality products time after time .
0	we have ordered about 00 different products in all and will never look at another printing company again .
0	also , i don_'_t think we '_ve ever paid full price for anything as their monthly offers are so awesome and varied .
0	thank_you to ashley and his designers for provide our companies with such a great service .
0	highly recommenced to everyone .
0	we book online just few hours before and everything was just perfect , good descriptions and perfect service .
0	we find the perfect place in very short time and at the first search .

0	claudio & nadia < 0
0	cheaper products , quick delivery , no_hassle !
0	perfume arrived quick , fully packaged !
0	genuine perfume , best price !
0	will shop again !
0	thanks cheapsmells !
0	:)
0	so happy that i didn_'_t settle for some old_fashioned boots opticians glasses that are 0x the price !
0	i used the gd trial service which arrived two_days_later i then decided on my frames and placed an order the same day !
0	two_days_later my glasses arrive and they are perfect !
0	so glad i found gd !
0	will definitely be back when i need new glasses !
0	thank_you !
0	i haven_'_t received my delivery !
0	where did you leave it ?
0	who signed for it ??
0	i need it for this weekend .
0	i recently_sold my phone on mazuma and i was very pleased with the speed of the service .
0	the money was in my account the day after_posting .
0	amazing .
0	would sell here again and would recommend to others .
0	at the start of the process i received emails relating to other_peoples cases .
0	i was then sent an incorrect form to complete , when i did get the correct form and submitted it there were some bits of evidence needed that were missing but the forms had not been checked with the excuse " staff are not trained in that particular form ".
0	it was a fees exempt form which i would have thought was a fairly standard form .
0	emails go unanswered and they seem to need constant prompting to update the case and move onto the next stage .
0	complete_waste of money , if you have more than two brain cells you are better off submitting the forms yourself it will be so much_cheaper and so much less_stressful .
0	this company made an extremely difficult time even more difficult .
0	update after response :
0	so sending emails relating to other cases , not replying to emails , having to ask the same question 0 times before getting an answer ( i can provide evidence of such if required ), needing to constantly prompt you to move onto the next stage ( which is the only_reason my divorce was completed in 0_months nothing to do with your service ) that constitutes " no_issues with our service to you " does it ?
0	says it all really
0	zazzle has the best stuff and their products are beautiful !
0	satisfied_customer !
0	website is easy to use , customer service is great and the order arrives swiftly .
0	was recommended by a friend and will_continue to use this company for all my lenses
0	i ordered havianas which were the wrong_size unfortunatley , i sent an_email enquiring what to do with these and how to get replacements .
0	i then decided to call as i assumed it would take days to reply via_email .
0	i spoke to a guy_who was really helpfull , he went through the sizing as havianas all vary slightly and it '_s hard to tell what size you need .
0	we went and measured the length of the flip_flop i wanted to confirm the size i needed .
0	once i had this sorted i got an_email from another person replying to my original email within 0 - 0 hours which was really fast .
0	i placed the order on the free shipping option for 0_days and it arrived in 0 working_days !
0	which is faster_than the next_day service i originaly used through amazon that took 0 - 0 working_days .
0	amazing service
0	also the flip_flops i got were great
0	i just wanted to warn_people before booking with this company - not to use them
0	they are actually the worst company i ever dealt_with .
0	i booked 0 tickets coming_back from belgrade to london .
0	i confirmed it all online which was correct .
0	after there was something wrong with the payment i called the next_day to pay over the phone .
0	after getting the email_confirmation later that day , i saw they autocorrected the main persons_name on the tickets to the card_holders name when taking the payment over the phone .
0	once i saw the error i called but couldn ’_t get_hold of anyone for weeks , just got told i had to email to get the name corrected again .
0	eventually someone got back to me and they refused to fix their error .
0	i had to cancel the flight , pay cancelation fees and rebook which i did with another company .
0	after waiting for the refund for 0_weeks , we found we were refunded all 0 flights less 0 cancelation fees after we specifically_asked them to only cancel 0 flight
0	by now the flights have gotten much more_expensive and they refused to un - cancel the flights or let us pay the same amount we originally paid for them
0	eventually the flight sold out and all 0 of us have to catch all separate flights home and have paid loads more plus cancelation fees .
0	they refuse to give any discounts or money off even_though it was 000_% their error .
0	they also never reply to emails , i had to send the same email 00 times in a row from 0 different email addresses just so 0 person would respond .
0	0_months later we are still pending the refund but otherwise things seem to be sorted as we re - booked new flights through another company
0	i am usually very calm when it comes to these kind of issues but this was the worst airline and worst booking experience i have ever dealt_with .
0	i really don_’_t want anyone to have to go through what i did so please don_'_t use this company !!!!!!!!!!!
0	!
0	hats_off to webtogs -- i don_'_t think i '_ve ever come_across such great customer service , let_alone the fact that the item concerned was half price in the first place .
0	i had a small problem with an ( otherwise brilliant ) icebreaker_top i bought last_year and rang webtogs ; they were super friendly and instantly emailed a returns_label with free_postage .
0	in well under a week i had received a replacement they had obtained from icebreaker .
0	and this on top of low_prices , next_day free delivery , etc -- big_thumbs_up .
0	they '_ll be my first_port of call for outdoor_kit in the future .
0	i found a maggot in a piece of cheese bought from aldi which still had more than a month before it '_s expiry_date .
0	when contacting aldi customer_services to complain i was contacted by phone and told that they would not refund the cheese as i did not have the receipt and had thrown the cheese in the bin .
0	when i started to explain how disgusted i was i patronised by the agent telling_me to stop shouting at her and she was terminating the call .
0	i did not shout at her and she just continued to tell me she was terminating the call .
0	i said i would write a review about this and i was told " go on then " and was cut_off .
0	i have only been with scottish_power for 0_months and have never in my life known anything like it .
0	" we are experiencing high volumes of calls and the wait will be 0 hours 00_mins , your call is moving to the front of the queue " if you don_'_t have a hands free phone find somewhere comfortable to sit .
0	i was on hold for 0hour 00mins during this time i did all my housework and 0 lots of washing with the phone cradled against my ear only to be cut_off by the stupid woman_who couldn_'_t get my name right .
0	i give my readings online but the woman said they can '_t be correct .
0	i assure they are correct but she was having none of it .
0	then they decided all my metre reading were wrong so i received a cheque wa hey !
0	£_000 . 00p i was delighted .
0	turns_out i had to pay them the cheque amount back as they had made a mistake .
0	i am absolutely_livid and am deffinatly changing suppliers .
0	я второй раз использую hostelbookers . com ( раньше пользовалась booking . com ).

0	highly_recommend booking your hen_night with chilli_sauce .
0	i don_'_t understand_why pretty_much the whole of scotland is considered an extended areas in the uk which may has additional surcharge for postage .
0	it costs no more to send to glasgow than it does to send to manchester and if their courier is charging them an extra £_00 to deliver a medium package to glasgow then they should sack their supply_chain manager .
0	dont don_'_t waste your time going through to checkout with purchases if you don_'_t live in england as delivery will cost you .

0	i received a phone_call from talk_talk saying that they wanted to give me a free tv package upgrade as they wanted to make_sure their existing_customers received the same deal as that offered to new customers .
0	he insisted several_times that i install the box as quickly as i could so that they could check it was working correctly and if i didn_'_t they could charge me for the box .
0	so i agreed to the free upgrade and only towards the end of the call did he say that my contract would be extended for a further 00 months .
0	now , i was not an unhappy talk_talk customer as have been with them for years and so , caught offhand and realising that you get nothing for nothing no matter what the sales_guy tells you , i said okay .
0	the box and router arrived lunchtime on 0th_november and my husband connected it that evening .
0	now for a variety of reasons including exposed cabling and router in the hall , dissatisfaction with tv offering and the fact that our smart_tv offered an equivalent service we decided to return the tv box and ask that we return to our old package of tv and broadband with the contract ending in a few_months .
0	this is where the trouble started .
0	firstly i spoke to an agent who asked me the details of why we wanted to return it .
0	she passed me onto someone in the loyalty team who again asked why we didn_'_t want it and he tried hard to convince us to keep it .
0	i was adamant that we didn_'_t want it and was dumbfounded to hear that it would cost us £_000 to return it .
0	i explained that at no time was this ever mentioned in the initial call selling us the deal , but he was equally adamant that we keep it or pay £_000 as the telephone and broadband deal we were on prior to this upgrade was not now available .
0	i asked to speak to a supervisor and after hanging on for a long while got through to a supervisor in india .
0	again i explained the situation and again the reasons we did not want the package and asked him why we couldn_'_t return the tv box under the distance_selling rules or under the 00 day cooling_off period .
0	he agreed that we shouldn_'_t have to pay the £_000 and i then asked him to organise that our account go back to its status before the " free " tv upgrade .
0	his computer failed and he had to call me back a while later .
0	on his return call he confirmed i could return the tv box and router , there would be no charge and he would arrange a return delivery bag .
0	he then passed me to the cancellations team to have my account returned to its original status .
0	imagine my frustration when the agent started from scratch telling_me i couldn_'_t cancel and it would cost £_000 to return the tv box - nothing on my file about not being charged !
0	i asked to speak to the supervisor who had passed the call to him ( mario i think ) but instead was put through to a heavily accented supervisor called rheyn suabez who told me it was not possible to return the box without_incurring a charge and that i had agreed to an_extension to my contract and the distance_selling rules and 00 day cooling_off period did not apply as i had connected the device the night before .
0	i explained hat this was only because the sales_rep had urged me several_times to get do this as quickly as possible after receipt .
0	i now had a 00 month_contract and a tv package i did not want .
0	the other option was to break the contract which would cost me £_000 !
0	on checking the terms and conditions i see that because i connected i will be deemed to have accepted these terms and conditions and agree that you will also lose your statutory right of cancellation under the regulations .
0	so that was why the sales_guy placed so much emphasis on getting it connected so quickly .
0	the minute you switch it on your are stuffed !
0	i have gone from being an ambivalent customer to now being a very frustrated and angry one : {
0	perhaps now i shouldn_'_t be surprised talktalk is prepared to employ such tactics to hand - cuff disaffected customers for relatively_short_term , comparatively minimal financial gain , rather_than have them actively want to stay because of good service and good value .
0	do not trust anything these people say to you on the phone .
0	do not agree to anything on the phone until you see all their ambiguous terms and conditions or you will be trapped into their 00 month plan .
0	******* update *******
0	received phone_call from talk_talk last night agreeing to roll back my contract and arrange free uplift of tv box after registering complaint with them .
0	maybe they are getting their act_together .
0	i ordered a mattress and it was delivered the following_morning .
0	i received a text to say when it would arrive and sure enough , it arrived within the time frame allocated .
0	i am really pleased with the qulaity of the mattress , it is so comfortable zzzzz
0	good quality website , fantastically priced tickets , no_hassle at all .
0	i especially liked the follow - up call to check i had received my e_- ticket .
0	very professional service !
0	it was the best thing i ever done joining bingo_cams i love the site see u later
0	i '_ve_used these_guys a few_times over the years for different consoles and i have always been very pleased with the service .

0	!
0	excellent service with friendly staff , received my tickets with no_problems at all .

0	clearly organised webside , easy to navigate and find what you ' re looking for .
0	a booking can be done in a minute plus i have never_experienced any_problems .
0	always fast delivery .
0	records and sleeves in perfect_condition , have never received any warped ones from juno .
0	a parcel i had been waiting on from australia for 0 - 0_months arrived when i was on holiday abroad .
0	my first complaint is that only two attempted delivery notes had been left in the mail , but the last of them said it had been the third delivery attempt .
0	i rescheduled the delivery online for the next working day and was patiently sat waiting for the whole of the ( unacceptable ) delivery window ( 0am - 0pm ).
0	when no parcel showed up , i called the number on the call card and was told that the parcel had been returned to sender , without_any notification of this .
0	yodel could give me no information whatsoever of the whereabouts of my package , no tracking_number , not even the name of the carrier who now has it or what address it is going to .
0	the person on the phone just kept saying yodel don_'_t do international_deliveries and therefore cannot help me .
0	my parcel is now lost , and as the sender was myself when i still lived in australia , there is no sender to take care of the package when it arrives .
0	booked a hen_weekend in cambridge for my sister and 00 girls .
0	great choices to choose from as a very mixed age_group and also personalities .
0	had a few hitches with the company during the booking stage , i felt like i was asking too much when all i wanted was a few more invites added .
0	i was also told different things by different members of staff .
0	when i first booked the gentleman was great and we set_up suitable activities and times .
0	but then when the final itinerary came out this was very different .
0	this was resolved quickly but i felt as if i was being difficult in what i was requesting .
0	although the second activity we changed to i feel was much_better on the actual night it just caused myself as the organiser unnecessary_stress .
0	i also feel the company need to change the way you pay so people can pay little and often as i found those tight for money struggled with the bulk payments and deadlines .
0	so the weekend itself started off great , we managed to book in early to the holiday_inn which was great !
0	so we all arrived at our first activity which was dirty_dancing , unfortunately the company had told me a different time to what they actually booked .
0	i was informed 00 . 00 but the bar was told 00 . 00 .
0	this would then effect the rest of the day , but i managed to change our next activity to be half an_hour later .
0	no further hitches , dirty_dancing was great and so was cocktail_making !
0	so all in all a fab weekend just a shame the organiser had the added stress .
0	we love topcashback , we tell everyone about it .
0	we have saved_hundreds of pounds with it over the years .
0	if you are an online shopper this website is a must .
0	the list of retailers is huge and the savings are great , plus unlike_other savings website it '_s free to join .
0	keep_up the great work topcashback team !
0	" i have bought quite a lot of products from dapw / soak n sleep , i find the quality of the bedding so luxuriously soft that the only_downfall is that i struggle more to get out my bed or the big cloud as my kids have now renamed it .
0	for quality , service and value i wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else .
0	i highly_recommend and have to friends and family . "
0	super quick and received the amount offered .

0	dead simple to use .

0	would definatley recommend and use again .
0	hostelbookers is easy to use , covering a wide_range of accommodation to suit any budget .
0	all costs are clear and up front and the extra information is useful and vital for choosing the right place for my trip .
0	i would definitely reccomended to friends and will be using the site again .
0	very well made and really comfortable could sitiin it for hours
0	i was very pleased with charm_school uk , a fantastic selection of chamrs and just what i was looking for .
0	charm price was very reasonable , as was the postage .
0	the item was delivered very quickly and packaged very nicely .
0	what more could i ask for ?
0	our booking with alpharooms was simple and easy .
0	after booking and paying we received our holiday voucher to hand in at the hotel and it was as simple as that .
0	very competitive_prices , cheapest on the net after shopping around .
0	highly_recommended .
0	thank_you xxx
0	ok , this site can be a little difficult to navigate and its not that simple to find the deals when they are out , but boy have i had some cheap flights in the past !
0	i highly_recommend that everyone keeps this in their bookmarks to keep an eye on
0	i love this site and i always check on there before buying anything !!
0	!
0	lots of great bargains and also assistance when required .
0	highly_recommended by me !
0	i have used play . com several_times to order offers and deals .
0	i love the way that delivery is free and arrives within a couple of days .
0	my family and i sat waiting for our food , all starvin !!
0	which never turned_up .
0	i phoned the chinese who said they had not received any order and had received several calls within the last half an_hour from other customers waiting for their food !
0	called just - eat - who reassured me it wasnt my fault !!!!
0	cheeky gits , and simply said that when the order had been sent to the chinese they had rejected it ????
0	i enquired whether it was not normal practice for them to tell me about this , save us waiting for our food and they said they usually do but this one seemed to just slip through the net !
0	!
0	wont_be using them again i '_m afraid !
0	excellent excellent
0	good service .
0	delivered relatively quick .
0	did leave with neighbour even_though that wasn_'_t requested , which was slightly worrying .
0	i was not protected in this case .
0	the garment was lovely however after one wear the quality seems to have diminished already , which isn_'_t desirable considering the amount paid for the dress .
0	beautifully_packaged but i did expect the dress to come with a protector bag given the nature of its fabric .
0	i feel luxury sites such as yourself should not charge shipping when i pay £_000 for a dress .
0	overall okay experience .
0	do not use them !
0	they offered me a two month free trial with credit vouchers i put in the codes to come_back .
0	these codes would not work , so tried several_times .
0	they ended_up taking four payments from my account !
0	after i had complained and informed them , they still took it out several days .
0	i have emailed them and they say it will take 0 - 0 working_days to be approved and refunded .
0	this was after finding they took two payments , i then discovered another two so have now had to email them again .
0	it is fraudulent and a mis selling of their products .
0	i would not recommend them due to this situation and their poor choice of films available instantly .
0	do not use !
0	i have read feedback on this site and a lot of it is negative , which is bad_news for the brand , but they appear to not care as they keep_repeating the same bad customer service and poor business mistakes .
0	have used moonpig many_times , excellent choice and good value .
0	if i were to want anything more it would be a handcrafted option to customise for those really special_occasions .
0	no - they may not always be the cheapest provider on the market , but their service is worth the little extra you pay in my opinion .
0	no bad_experience to date over several_years of using them .
0	on more than one occasion , yodel have left my parcels with my wheelie bins , totally indiscreetly with valuable goods inside .
0	this is totally_unacceptable and is not a safe location - all of my neighbours are happy to keep parcels on my behalf and do so on a regular_basis with all other delivery services i have used .
0	sent my phone on friday and by monday my order was approved for the full_amount .
0	two_days_later the moment was in my account , really pleased !
0	i was skeptical at first but after_reading the reviews on trustpilot . com i decided to take the plunge , after all the game i wanted was marked down to a very low price .
0	i needn_'_t have been worried as the order was delivered to me within the hour ( i believe it took longer for me as i have a paypal and personal email .
0	very happy with my purchase and recommended them to my friends and so .
0	well i can '_t knock it at all .
0	less then 00_hours to arrive brilliant postage_costs and reliable service .
0	i will be using you again that is for sure .
0	thanx a lot .
0	well as i ordered these a week before xmas and they came a week after to say i '_m impressed is an_understatement and having put them onto the devices they where for they look awesome and made them look like brand_new items thanx a lot i ail be using you again .
0	xx
0	well , i brought 0 lady_gaga tickets for stade de france in april of this year .
0	it is now exactly 00 days till the event and do not have any sign of tickets being dispatched and i know tickets dont usually get sent " 0 - 0_weeks till the event " but i have put a lot of time and money into this trip and as i am travelling from england i would like to be assured that the seller will be sending them soon as possible .
0	me and my friend are both hardcore gaga fans and decided that because at the time she was sold out in manchester and london nothing would stop us so decided to use the website which i have heard was so " great " which was of course viagogo . co . uk , this is my first time in dealing_with this website and i can safely say this will be the last .
0	i have sent an_email_saying that if i do not recieve an_email_saying they have been dispatched by the 00th_sept then i will be requesting for a full_refund and putting in a formal_complaint !
0	my transaction_id is 0000000 and if i could get an actual_human response that would be a bonus too !
0	hostelbookers . com is the best hostel booking website of them all because its format , options , and prices are better_than the others !
0	i love that they display all the options in a condensed easy to read format , showing pricing for both private and double rooms , in slender rows .
0	i have found that they include just as many if not more hostels than the other_websites .
0	and their prices are often marked down .
0	their main page for each_hostel is easy to navigate and read .
0	this is my go - to hostel booking site !
0	i am so impressed with the quality , service , extremely quick delivery .
0	i have ordered my 0d_crystal for my husband for our_wedding_anniversary .
0	it '_s still two_weeks till our anniversary and i just can '_t wait to give it to him .
0	it is absolutely_stunning .
0	will recommend incrystals to everyone i know .
0	thank_you for my gorgeus crystal :-).
0	i will definitely use incrystals again !
0	exellent !!
0	thanx
0	this is my second time ordering from sw and so far had no_problems with them .
0	there shipping time is reasonable and the prices are unbeatable .
0	even_though they don_'_t offer free shipping they do offer lots and i mean lots of samples and i have not seen one company offer so many .
0	this not only compensates the shipping cost but it goes beyond that .
0	the whole_process is so easy and understandable to process with no_hassles or problems .
0	i will_continue to purchase my items from sw and i will recommend this company to anyone who is looking for quality products and low_prices .
0	you are great , as soon as i posted my old phone , that i had lying_around for ages , the money was in my bank within 0_days !
0	thank_you :-)
0	i recently_purchased a solid_oak_dining_table with 0 chairs and an oak_sideboard from wowcher , totalling nearly_£_000 . 00 !
0	we were in the process of moving_house so didn_’_t open it straight_away left it all wrapped up , in the packaging etc … to open it last sunday to find the dining_table all broken underneath !
0	i contacted mountrose who the table was supplied from and they said to contact wowcher direct .
0	on monday i called wowcher and they advised me to e_mail the damaged photos over to them and someone would return my e_mail that day ….
0	surprise_surprise nothing heard .
0	so i called tuesday to be advised “ the lady in despatch wasn_’_t in yesterday ” one lady ?!
0	ok , no problem , someone would look at my damaged photos and get back to me that day ( tuesday )… by 0 pm id still not heard a whisper , so i called again wednesday to be told someone would get back to me that day … sure enough by 0pm id had an e_mail yippee !...
0	they wanted to see damaged photos ( id already sent these on monday ) !!
0	and wanted to know a day the following week when someone would be available to pick the table up ….
0	after a long wait trying to get through to customer_services , they advised me that the lady_named kennedy had gone home now and she was working her way through the various e_mails and mine hadn_’_t got to the top !
0	here ’_s a suggestion wowcher employ more than one person then !
0	so here we are friday_afternoon and i ’_m still_waiting to see if my table is going to be picked_up in just0 days ’ time as i have to arrange somebody to sit at home all day whilst they come … and weather the new table will be delivered on the same day !...
0	i have bought several items from wowcher and will never buy from them again after this utter_rubbish customer experience !
0	true relaxation of the mind , body and soul .
0	very friendly staff , makes you feel welcomed and a true value for money .
0	very clearly_explained to me various forms of massage and very authentic traditional thai massage is practiced .
0	clean environment and makes you feel very comfortable .
0	advice - please book your appointments and get lost in the sabai thai massage .
0	love - rat
0	scandalous company , advertising totally fictitious prices !
0	they say ' good availability ' on selected seats but they are mysteriously ' sold out ' when you phone and then they quote a much higher price ( almost_double ).
0	the website is also a con , it looks like your going to be able to book the flights but when you go through to the payment page the price shoots up , if you didn_'_t notice you could end up booking at a much higher price !
0	representatives are incredibly rude and patronising when you phone making out you ' re stupid for even thinking you can get flights at the advertised price !
0	awful that they are allowed to continue trading and awful that skyscanner continues to include them in searches !
0	i looked around at a few mobile recycle sites , and thought i '_d go with mazuma .
0	i sent of for a postage pack which arrived within two_days , i posted the pack on the friday and by monday the money was in my account and it was the amount i was told , alot of sites give you less money when they actually receive the phones .
0	great company , great service !
0	000_% recommended
0	husband very happy = happy wife , thank_you
0	read some bad_reviews after i booked pole_dancing and butler in the buff !
0	wasn_'_t sure what to expect !
0	i have to say that i couldn_'_t have been more happier with the service i received .
0	the ease of booking and paying individually was great .
0	the queries i had were answered quickly and to my satisfaction .
0	both pole_dancing instructor and butler were fantastic couldn_'_t fault them .
0	00 happy girls after a great hen_do !!
0	thanks again :)
0	i placed an order yesterday_afternoon and have received it the next_day !
0	they have such a massive_range pf products , it was tough picking out a gift for my husband .
0	the products i did pick were of top quality .
0	thanks !
0	we have two of the large acrylics now and they are gorgeous .
0	we picked wedding photos with bright_colours and they have turned_out so vibrant !
0	the delivery speed is brilliant too - when we ordered our second one , it arrived so quickly , we didn_'_t even realise it was the acrylic until we opened it !
0	will definitely order again .
0	thanks !
0	i almost sent my phone to envirofone for about £_00 .
0	fortunately , i used a price comparison site and fonebank_offered me almost_double .
0	sent my phone off with the paid_envelope and the money was transferred over quickly .
0	thanks !
0	i was very pleased with the out come of my order from serenata_flowers , the flowers and vas were beautiful and the teddy was really cute and cuddly , they got there on time and nothing was broken :) i would shop with them again x
0	order number 000000000
0	i found your website very easy to use and i also found the other customer reviews very helpful .
0	my order was delivered very quickly and i was kept_informed as to the status of my order at all times which i liked .
0	upon_receiving the tank , i was very impressed with the quality of it .
0	my son has yet to use it as he hasn_'_t had his_birthday yet but i am sure he will be totally delighted with it .
0	great service and great product .
0	many_thanks !
0	fantastic service .
0	was sent an_email to notify_me my dog_food was on it '_s way .
0	delivery was very quick .
0	the price was the best i found anywhere on line .
0	would thoroughly_recommend to anyone .
0	i also liked the possibility to be able to collect the food direct from their warehouse in markyate which we probably will do next time .
0	found the process really easy and would deffo recommend .
0	i like the fact that if they dont_think phone is worth what was quoted they send it back :)
0	bought item then after a week was told not in stock .
0	0weeks later still_waiting for my refund !!
0	avoid id say !
0	as many have mentioned , i was a little_worried_about sending my old ipads to a company i had never_heard of - however i am pleased to say i was proven very wrong !!!
0	mazumamobile offered me £_00 for two , first generation ipads , ipad_recycle offered me £_000 !
0	!
0	they said that one was a grade_b , rather_than a grade a like i claimed , however because i sent in two ipads they would offer me the original_quote - what other company would do this ??
0	?
0	i sent the ipads by special delivery on saturday , and by the time i was home monday after work , i had an_email_confirming the price , and the money was in my account - awesome service !!
0	!
0	will use you again , and recommend to others :)
0	incredibly surprised how well everything went , i was prepared for a bit of a haggle with mazuma over the price of my phone but they sent me an_email a day after i posted my phone saying a check had been posted for me for the exact_amount i was quoted and the check turned_up the very next_day , very impressed , thank_you .
0	only reviewing on customer service as have not recieved parcel yet .
0	but sam on their facebook_page was very helpful , and quick to respond .
0	the service was quick and easy to use and the entire_transaction was smooth and efficent .
0	i received my clarsonic mia soon after i placed the order with a signature_required .
0	i am pleased with the product as well as the service .
0	i would recommend this company to anyone .
0	where do i begin ?
0	i booked a hotel in san_francisco over the weekend with hotelsclick .
0	i subsequently attempted to call up and speak to someone about my booking .
0	for three_days i called every_single number listed at the bottom of their website , including for their_offices abroad .
0	i never managed to get through to anyone , despite calling several_times throughout the morning and afternoon .
0	i also called the hotel directly and they had no confirmation of my booking whatsoever , despite the money being taken from my account .
0	the red warning lights were now flashing .
0	i also emailed hotelsclick asking someone to call me , i have not received a reply nor a phone_call .
0	i decided to cancel the booking which i was entitled to do since i was within the cancellation window .
0	i have confirmation that the booking has_been cancelled but no refund has_been given , despite the faqs on the website stating that refunds are given the same day .
0	my booking_reference is h0000 - 00000 .
0	please can someone at hotelsclick contact me about my refund as a matter of urgency .
0	please , please do not book with hotelsclick - i have never come_across a company like this that takes your money yet does not pick_up the phone or reply to emails .
0	i look_forward to hearing from you hotelsclick .
0	regards

0	i would definitely recommend this to anyone and will be my go to hostel booking site !
0	i found double0 '_s service excellent .
0	every time i called to find out when my tickets would arrive they were always very imformative and even called me to let_me know that they had been dispatched .
0	i would recommend them and would use them again .
0	love the product , but was slightly_disappointed with the shipping time , as it was for a christmas_present and i '_d ordered it well in_advance , but ended_up hoping it would arrive in time to wrap up .
0	the pack to send in my old phone arrived earlier_than i expected it to , and the money was in my bank_account the day after i posted it !
0	excellent service !
0	i love shopping here , sells things no one else does like fermented cod_liver oil etc
0	everything has arrived , quickly , intact and with care .
0	really lovely mince wonderful marbling taste is devine
0	happy to be a very loyal_customer
0	fantastic range of gear with reasonable_prices and great delivery service .
0	friendly and knowledgeable_staff who are always ready to help .
0	highly_recommended !
0	by far cheaper_than many of thier competitors , it makes a realy difference to our stationary budget , being_able to get the same products from here at a much_better price .
0	customer service and delivery are also faultless .
0	this site is ok .
0	it doesn_'_t give you much detail and you need to know the make of the vehicle you ' re checking .
0	i just use it to check the cost of tax for any new cars i buy .
0	i sell everything on preloved .
0	it is my first_port of call when i '_m looking for something to buy .
0	they are quick to reply to emails .
0	obviously they can '_t be held_responsible for some of the sellers and buyers but as a site it '_s brilliant .
0	very easy to understand .
0	i like the membership .
0	it gives you more chance to buy the things you want before the rest of the world !
0	preloved is my favourite web_site !
0	i would and do recommend this site to everybody .
0	for value you can '_t beat them .
0	i have been with them now for two years and each year i could not find anything cheaper .
0	i haven_'_t made a claim so can '_t comment on that but the staff seem polite and very helpful .
0	i recommend this company 000_%.
0	as i struggled through the door with three children ( 0 being in a car_seat ) and two under 0 , two men stood chatting away to each other .
0	i had around £ 0000 to buy carpet for my stairs and bedrooms .
0	i finally manage to get in and have a look around for 0 minutes clear in my mind what i was going to go for .
0	i look towards the door and an older man and women are about to walk in .
0	the to staff couldn_'_t get to the door quicker !
0	speaking nicely to them and asking if they would like any help !
0	seriously !
0	because i have three children i must be poor right !
0	well that was it .
0	i decided not to spend my money there !
0	i shouted how rude that was as i left and wrote a letter of complaint .
0	they sent me a 00_% ( i think ) money off voucher .
0	no apology , just money off .
0	i would never shop in carpet right now or in the future .
0	very quick dispatch and delivery .
0	great value for money .
0	i recommend this company 000_%.
0	i have used viovet 0 times_now and two of the three occasions i had next working day delivery .
0	i 000_% recommend them to everyone .
0	the products are very good value for money .
0	always a good sale on , the products are a lot_cheaper on surfdome compared to a lot of other_sites !
0	i have just purchased 0 tickets for the david haye vs tyson fury boxing match in february .
0	the booking process was very straight_forward , and when i rang to enquire_about if the seats would be together , the call operator was very helpful .
0	the seats are in a brilliant position and i can '_t wait for the event !
0	!
0	this was the first time i have used double 0 tickets but i will defiantly be using them for future events !!
0	!
0	client depuis quelques années , le_prix de croquette pour mes lapins devient le plus en plus cher .
0	le sachet de 00_kg été vendu à 00 . 00_euros en avril est maintenant à 00 . 00_euros !!
0	pour_les mêmes produits sur_le site petmed . co . uk , le_prix est nettement moins cher , malgré que_le fait au royaume uni le tva est plus haut .
0	customer service is really excellent , shipping is super_fast to france all the way from the uk .
0	very happy with the service and the products , i will come_back again :)
0	i recently started_using wowcher when i saw a great deal for a break away to find that i could not book for 0_days after i had paid and that the only time i could go was not available .
0	i telephoned to ask if wowcher could assist in helping with availability however they quickly advised i had to call the merchant who said i then had to pay more money if i wanted the date advertised .
0	i telephoned wowcher back who advised it was out of their control and if i wanted a refund i could have one .
0	i said yes and the advisor said she would process the refund , i asked how long it would take to receive and she said within 0 working_days .
0	i have just checked my bank_account and no refund .
0	so i have called wowcher who are denying saying they would process the refund and it was up to me to request it ... correct me if i am wrong but the conversation clearly_states that i would like a refund and how long it would take to be received to which the rep answered , is this not classed_as requesting a refund .
0	i have asked the rep to listen to the call which clearly says that i asked the rep to tell me when it would be issued !
0	!
0	i am awaiting a call back .
0	however i will never use wowcher again , nor will i recommend them due to the poor service and when i you request a refund by telephone , letter or email you expect it to be sent !
0	just wasted over an_hour of my life adding items to my shopping_cart only to find that when i went to complete order , my delivery slot had been taken .
0	i am well aware of the 0 hour delivery slot hold time , but i was well within that .
0	it would usually take me around the same time to choose these items in a shop , however this time my shopping_cart was deleted .
0	this has happened to me before but i was willing to put it down to some sort of interupted internet_connection .
0	i '_m pretty sure that i will not bother trying to do this again even_though i have been a loyal_customer of yours for the past 00 years .
0	not happy .
0	very hungry
0	would definitely recommend to a friend
0	i found this company on a search_engine .
0	took 0 minutes to find what i needed , order and pay for it .
0	arrived within the time scales stated .
0	such a hard website to navigate
0	i always google it !
0	good service but not top quality , i was expecting like it details on the advert that the delivery man would take the shopping into the kitchen , but he just left it at my front_door , and it wasnt all bagged either .
0	not to mention the products that were not in stock that were replaced with something_else now i understand that they do run_out of stock , but replacing burger buns with hot dog rolls , now i cant see the logic ..
0	paid virgin mobile for next_day delivery and yodel deliver it to the wrong_address and it has_been signed for , by the time i realise the company '_s call_centre had shut as for some silly reason they shut at 0pm even_though you can receive deliveries up until_0pm !!
0	who is employed by a delivery company who can '_t get a flipping address correct , now i cant find my very expensive product .
0	the call_centre when i did manage to speak to them briefly just fobbed me off and gave_me the van_drivers mobile number , now i guess its just because he wanted to go home , but the van_driver wont answer his ruddy phone , so they will be getting an earful on the phone first thing in the morning until something has happened .
0	compareholidaymoney was recommended to me by a friend after i was unsure where to buy my currency .
0	i have never purchased it online before so was apprehensive to do so for the first time .
0	i had nothing to worry_about as this site is great !
0	it '_s user - friendly and simple to navigate .
0	it offered competitive_rates and was delivered quickly once ordered !
0	i will_definately be telling friends and family about it !
0	quick delivery , excellent condition
0	absolute_joke of a company ... ordered £_00 worth of food for my boy cat who is on a special prescription_diet .
0	within an_hour money was refunded though it took nearly three_days for the money to actually credit back to my account .
0	having phoned for an explanation i spoke to two very rude staff_members who stated that pdol no_longer deliver to inverness scotland which is most certainly mainland_uk as it was too expensive though they always did up until recently so i find it difficult to believe they '_ve only just noticed the higher costs to themselves seen as they have been trading for years .
0	having found the same product on ebay i ordered from pdol0000 but did not realise they are the same company and same thing happened only it took them four days to issue a refund through paypal which is now being held (£_00 ) and won_'_t be available to me until goodness_knows when .
0	worst and most rude company i have ever dealt_with .
0	i strongly_suggest you try petfleas . co . uk as they provided me with a first_class extremely quick service .
0	shame on you pdol , don_'_t lie you don_'_t give a damn about animals all you care about is profit !
0	just noticed a review from a customer in denmark , you can send to denmark but you can '_t send within your_own country , bunch of idiots !
0	ordered moderate_calorie urinary tract wet 00 pouch and order was delivered extremely quickly within two_days ... amazing .
0	free delivery and if buying in bulk even cheaper .
0	a much_better and far more professional company than pet drugs online who refused to deliver the same product to a city in scotland as we were not considered to be part of mainland_uk , if pdol can '_t read a map properly i certainly would not trust them with anything related to my pets !
0	will be recommending this company to everyone as they have provided a fantastic service and i will most certainly be ordering from them again very soon .
0	thank_you petfleas . co . uk you have made my boy very happy and healthy with his prescription_diet .
0	merry_christmas to all the staff and a very happy new year :-_d x
0	ordered effipro_flea and tick_treatment for cats four pack .
0	cheapest price i could find lots cheaper_than any other site and i checked loads .
0	received two_days after ordering ... fantastic .
0	highly_recommend i will be back :-_d
0	have had a credit account for two months and owe only £_00 .
0	made first payment which was double the asked for minimum_amount .
0	tried to place an order which was cancelled then tried again thinking it was just a glitch and again order cancelled .
0	phoned a 00p_per_minute line only to be told my account is under review ... the lady explained that the company were looking in to my purchases and payment history and that i should attempt to place an order after my next statement which isn_'_t for another three_weeks !
0	customer service agent then advised that i should pay for my order cash to which i replied " that kind of defeats the purpose of having a credit account doesn_'_t it ".
0	this does not amuse me as i am trying to rebuild a dodgy teenage period of bad credit decisions .
0	what an odd company i would not suggest anybody no matter_how utterly desperate you truly are and believe me i too was desperate but believe me i '_m not that desperate to be mucked about by a company who feed of the poorer in our society to line there own already fat pockets .
0	i will happily go back to purchasing everything cash from the likes of eb * y , am ** on and pl **. com where at_least you don_'_t have to put up with utter_nonsense !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	! grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr !
0	only company i could find to return six sets of venetian_blinds weighing in at 00 . 0kg .
0	parcel picked_up monday received by recipients on wednesday .
0	online tracking very useful .
0	would recommend :-)
0	received quickly and well_packaged .
0	great price even_though your vet rips you off in prescription charges to actually order online .. recommend :-)
0	product arrived within the delivery time stated .
0	product was great no_problems .
0	emails and communication over shipping was great as shipped to south_korea .
0	i would use again and recommend .
0	i provided my details to mazumba_mobile online on a sunday .
0	i received the postage bag on the tuesday .
0	posted the mobile wednesday_afternoon and the money was in my account by the thursday - excellent service .
0	cannot_fault at all !
0	hey there !!
0	!....
0	the overall experience was awesome , fast response & so efficient !!!.
0	i first heard of mazuma_mobile services on a tv_ad that i had watched , i thought to myself " why don_'_t i give it a go " since i have a few non - working mobile_phones laying_around , why not trade it in for quick cash .
0	so i did .
0	i have never seen or heard of a fast response service that keeps to its word .
0	i '_ve even got my friends talking_about it .
0	awesome stuff , quality reassurance , customer friendly .
0	i already knew the shoes i wanted so didn_'_t really need to phone up for advice but i phoned the office when there was an issue at the checkout ( it was trying to charge for delivery when it should have been free ).
0	my call was answered straight_away by a very friendly man who advised me to proceed with the order an if the delivery was added he would refund it straight_away .
0	i placed my order at 0000pm on the thursday ( no deliver charge was added in the end ) and received my shoes on the saturday_morning .
0	friendly staff who actually answer the phone , speedy free delivery - on orders over_£_00 , the shoes i wanted in stock and much_cheaper_than_anywhere_else , what more could you ask for ?
0	!
0	very uncomplicated website to use .
0	it was simple to select when and where i wanted the cover for .
0	it loads the groups of sports in a separate box but not in a new page which is good .
0	automatically shows the comparison between the different_levels of cover on the same page without having to select an option for that which is great to just skim through what my needs are and if its worth_paying extra for it .
0	great prices overall and generally cheaper_than i have found elsewhere with more included .
0	fast and easy transaction and would highly_recommend everyone to use this service .
0	good site to skim over to get a brief idea of places , restaurants and things to do but a lot of reviews on there aren_'_t great or true to the place in my experience !
0	great quick service .
0	well_packaged and instructions i left about delivery were followed ( not many companies do ) website quick and easy to purchase items .
0	best price for the gill suit i have seen anywhere and its perfect .
0	thanks again , was a pleasure buying from you .
0	will highly_recommend to my sailing friends
0	if you expect them to respond to you with any level of politeness you will be sorely_disappointed .
0	not only have they ignored emails but they have failed to follow through on any of the actions that they stated they would take .
0	they have also taken to ignoring our pleas to sort_out our flight details it takes them an average of a week to respond to each email and each email is usually followed up at 00 hour intervals .
0	the free home_trial was great - when i '_ve bought glasses before , i '_ve been in the opticians for at_least an_hour trying to decide which ones to get ( i '_m v .
0	indecisive !)
0	so the home_trial gave_me time to try them on in my own_home .
0	the whole_process was very quick - i put through my home_trial request on sunday , frames arrived on tues , ordered my glasses with prescription on tuesday_evening and they were delivered on the friday .
0	good quality glasses and a good price too compared to specsavers
0	this is the 0nd time i '_ve_used mazuma and the service was very quick and easy both_times .
0	i would definitely use mazuma again
0	great service , good price and quality product , would definitely recommend :-)
0	avoid this company at all costs .
0	purchased a new contract over the phone on 00th_october .
0	received phone the next_day on the completely incorrect contract costing_£ 0 more per_month !
0	not what i ordered and not discussed on the phone at all , this was a unauthorised sale .
0	called twice on 000 number trying to return phone , left holding for over 00_mins each time costing me money .
0	had to request return details twice before they were emailed to me and have never come_across such bad don_'_t care type attitude from staff .
0	don_'_t be tempted_by their cheap deals they don_'_t exist and are lies !
0	as a first_timer at amigo i found the staff very helpful and the form easy to use i would recomed them to anyone .
0	all perfect and bla_bla_bla ...
0	but , i found a mistake on the website that could cost the shop pretty a loottt of money .
0	i managed to place an order worth 0 , 0k pounds for 00 gbp .
0	according to law , i didnt have to cancel my order , i could claim the shop to send it to me .
0	but i did cancel , asking only for a little discount on the next purchase i was planning to make .
0	for whet ?
0	for the help i provided , showing how stupid the system is and how much mony they could lose if more people did the same and decide not to be so polite .
0	this is what dissappointed me reallllyy badly when shopping in this shop .
0	never book with odopo !!
0	they canceled my flights the day after i booked them and didnt even inform_me .
0	they are now saying i am only entitled to a tax refind of 00 pounds which will cost 00 pounds to apply for .
0	they are a scam !!!
0	!
0	we had an order cancelled at 0 . 00 on sunday_night 00 / 00 / 00 so no other supermarkets were open so we had no shopping for the week .
0	i put_together a letter and email it to them and i have still not had a reply from tesco letter below
0	dear_sir or madam ,
0	i am extremely annoyed about the way tesco has let us down .
0	when you read what happened i am sure you will be just as horrified .
0	i was going to write a letter of complaint to your chairman and send it by recorded delivery .
0	after_speaking to my daughter i decided to email you first and give you the chance to restore my faith in tesco ’_s before taking the matter further .
0	my daughter always orders the weekly_shop on line and we normally have it delivered between_0am and 0am on a saturday .
0	this week my wife and i were away until sunday_afternoon so the shopping was ordered for between 0pm and 0pm on sunday .
0	when there was still no sign of our shopping after 0pm on sunday my wife rang your helpdesk and spoke to darren a customer_services manager .
0	instead of making matters better they were made much worse .
0	my wife was told the order had been cancelled she asked why and by who but darren did not know .
0	she was horrified .
0	she was put on hold .
0	darren came back and said the delivery vehicle had broken down .
0	my wife asked the obvious question why no one had bothered informing us .
0	the reply was i don_’_t know .
0	my wife passed the phone to me i asked darren why you could not have used another vehicle .
0	at that time on a sunday_night there must have been several vehicles parked up .
0	darren cut me off and said i am telling you about the store .
0	thinking i had got it wrong i said so the problem was with the store not the vehicle .
0	darren said the problem was caused by a vehicle breakdown .
0	i replied the question is still valid why you hadn_’_t used another vehicle .
0	darren replied it was not just a vehicle you needed but also a driver .
0	i pointed_out the obvious that you had a driver for the broken down vehicle .
0	that driver could have driven one of the other vehicles .
0	it became_obvious that darren was not helping the matter .
0	darren then said the delivery could be rearranged .
0	i pointed_out we urgently_needed milk and also bread and meat for three lots of sandwiches for the following_morning .
0	i passed the phone back to my wife because she knew if and when she wanted the order to be delivered , darren then became very off hand and said .
0	i want to talk to one person not two .
0	well pardon me we are the ones that have been left without food on a sunday_night when all the supermarkets are closed .
0	it must have been much worse to have to speak to two people .
0	customers need to be able to rely_on you .
0	i know the vehicle breakdown could not be helped , but you could have handled it so much_better .
0	to just cancel the delivery without informing us i am sure you will agree it is totally_unacceptable .
0	as i tried to point out to darren i am sure all your vehicles were not in use at 0pm on sunday .
0	customer_services are supposed to at_least try to make things better darren made it much worse .
0	as you know it is not what someone says but how they say it .
0	my daughter has received an_email from you .
0	no explanation of what went wrong or assuring us you will do your best to deliver our order if it ever happens again .
0	not even a promise that in future you will bother to inform us if there is a problem .
0	your email did contain a voucher for £ 0 off our next shop .
0	we had used a £ 0 voucher off the order that you failed to deliver that is now lost .
0	we also prepay the delivery charge .
0	during the recent bad_weather you cancelled our order .
0	we understood why even_though we managed to drive to the store in wrexham .
0	it did not alter the fact that we lost out on the prepaid delivery twice .
0	not a very good deal .
0	can you imagine our horror finding out after 0pm on a sunday_night that your entire food order had been cancelled ?
0	any other day of the week ok but sunday_night when all the supermarkets are closed .
0	what were we supposed to do ?
0	as i am sure you know a company ’_s reputation is hard won and very easily lost .
0	people need to trust you to deliver what they order and deliver it on time .
0	if they can ’_t trust you they will go elsewhere .
0	i am hoping you can restore my faith in tesco ’_s , supply a valid explanation of what happened and reassure_me that if i continue to shop with you i will never be treated so badly again .
0	if not i will be sending a copy of this email with a letter by recorded delivery to your chairman .
0	on the 0th_april “ you and yours ” on bbc radio 0 broadcast a feature about why tesco price match is misleading .
0	i am sure they will do a follow_up .
0	if the follow_up feature mentions that customers also cannot trust you to deliver their order it will make customers think_twice about using your company .
0	it ’_s up to you now you have the opportunity to put all of this right .
0	i look_forward to hearing from you .
0	regards

0	supplement_warehouse sells double the amount of d0 thermal shock for nearly the same price as gnc .
0	and lets just face it , its much_easier to shop online without a sales_representative pushing you to buy something more_expensive .
0	used ao . com twice .
0	first time was for a freezer and the second was a fridge .
0	excellent experience on both_occasions .
0	wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else now .
0	i am absolutely appauled by their service .
0	specified for delivery on mother '_s day , as they offered .
0	flowers were delivered saturday , however nobody was around to recieve them , as obv we were expecting them on sunday !
0	so sunday came , no flowers , how very embarassing , and disappointing for my mother , when they did arrive they were already bloomed & starting to die .
0	i contacted customer service who ignored my emails , until they recieved 0 emails from me theye eventually replied .
0	the reply was rude , & with numerous grammatical errors .
0	they refused me a refund because i used a voucher_code ( which they gave_me when i received flowers from them ).
0	i suggest they dont give customers voucher_codes if they dont want to accept them !
0	i would never use them again , too expensive for the few flowers you get , and very poor delivery service !!
0	!
0	just bought new_washing_machine and fridge_freezer from this lovely family run business , staff delivered and installed for me , great service .
0	i love to book in hostelbookers since i don_'_t pay booking_fees and the site is friendly .
0	you can manage easily to find the right place for you .
0	ratings are accurate and prices the most competitive i '_ve found .
0	if you are about to book a hostel , do not doubt about it .
0	i can tell you even cancelling is easy to do .
0	i have used parcel to go a number of times and can say that the chat_function is great .
0	have had a great service today from sammie_taylor
0	they say that there are seats available at a specific price , but then try to charge you three_times as much .
0	never book with them !
0	complete mess , courier couldn_'_t be bothered to deliver my parcel .
0	neither courier or parcel0go wanted to listen to my complaint .
0	kept getting passed between the two .

0	since the end of august ( it is nearing october ) our internet has stopped_working .
0	this was firstly due to a faulty router and now the exchange where i live has_been down .
0	i received a message last night to say it had been fixed , but lo - and - behold it is still not working .
0	i spoke to the customer service team who , after some convincing , told me i wouldn_'_t be charged for the engineer for problem number one .
0	upon_checking my bank_account yesterday when the money was due to come out , they took the full balance including the normal payment for the internet service we haven_'_t received for one month .
0	i am_appalled at the audacity they have to say one thing and do another .
0	they have let_me pay for a service they have not been providing and i was assured that the money wouldn_'_t come out of my account , so i didn_'_t cancel the direct_debit .
0	even if i did cancel it i would get blacklisted , and so you see they have caught me in a catch 00 .
0	please let_me leave talk_talk and give me my money back .
0	do not go near .
0	the website was aesthetically_pleasing and easy to use , all products are well described ; what you see is what you get .
0	i made a purchase in no time and selected special delivery which indeed came the next working day as promised .
0	the items ordered are of great quality ( with the exception of one item which is the provider '_s problem , not honour '_s fault )
0	definitely would recommend !
0	it took 0 - 0 mins to load each page during checkout ..
0	there is absolutely nothing wrong with my broadband_speed and have used " just eat " before which i never had this problem with .
0	sort it out hungryhouse !
0	i '_m going to a few european_countries in the next few_months and knew straight_away that my best chances were to use hostelbookers . com .
0	i '_ve booked all my accommodation with them , i can search fast and it '_s easy to compare_hostels and best of all not hidden_fees !
0	amazon is one of my favorite online_retailers , constantly good service , fast delivery even when i '_ve chosen the free post and packaging , items are always well boxed and wrapped .
0	this is the third time i '_ve orderd online from them and it just isn_'_t worth the wait !
0	first order was over two_weeks , second order was three_weeks and third order was dispatched on the 0th_jan and still_hasn_'_t arrived :-(
0	really great service and products , so easy to get the photo_book you want as you can choose the layout .
0	my hard back small square photo_book arrived today and just could not be_happier as it '_s the same quality as a book ( reading ), would definitely recommend paying for glossy_pages as it really is worth it .
0	will definitely be ordering from here again .
0	i received a code for 00 free photos and had some images i had been meaning to print for a while so though i would give them a shot and was really surprised at the quality of the photos and also the handy photo size plastic case which is a great for protecting your photos during_transit .
0	fabulous selection of jewlery and watches and some really pretty pieces that would be fab for christmas .
0	so already starting christmas shopping and my 0yr_old has_been constantly stopping outside jewllers and showing me the watches so need to find a fun watch but that wasn_'_t to childish as he really dislikes the ones for children round his age so had a look on tic_watches and was pleased to find oclock watches which have an adult feel but are quite modern and now are doing disney which i know he will love , got the xsmall and is a perfect size for younger_children , was delivered fast as living in jersey it can take a while for deliveries just super impressed with the service .
0	was really impressed withthe chooice of products avaliable and even more impressed by the fast and reliable delivery especially as live in the channel_islands and getting deliveries here can sometimes be slow .
0	was really impressed with the product and definately plan to order from here again .
0	absolutely love moon_bingo !
0	the chat_hosts make you feel at ease , you can have a giggle while you play and over all it is a fun experience , the bingo_rooms are great with lots of ones to choose from 😊

0	i ordered my small fish reefs on sunday_afternoon , it showed on system that they were in stock and as i was in desperate_need of them i chose this company , it is now thursday and they are have still not even been dispatched , i know its not as bad as some problems you get with buying on line but i do spend a lot of time buying stuff on line and in my experience , some shop that have items in stock have a 0 - 0 day dispatch time .
0	i have emailed the company and they did reply with in couple of hours to say that item will be getting dispatch end of this week so will be with me 0 - 0 working_days after this .. so tuesday 0_days after i ordered it .

0	great customer service too .
0	would definitely recommend them very helpful
0	i was looking around to trade in my phone and found a site that offered me £_000 i looked up reviews on the site and so many people complained about them saying they never recieved the full_amount , so i decided to trade in with mazuma for £_000 instead and i '_m_glad i did i applied online recieved the pack a couple of days_later sent out my phone and within about 0days of applying on the site i had £_000 in my bank_account !!
0	more than impressed !!
0	my advice would be if your looking around for the best trade - in price for what may seem maybe £_00 more you '_ll get a much_better deal and service with mazuma !
0	i ordered my washing_machine on 00 / 00 / 00 .
0	it was due to be delivered on 00 / 0 / 00 , i received a phone_call on 00 / 0 confirming delivery between_0am - 0pm .
0	at 0000 i called bestbuy as i still hadn_'_t received my washing_machine , they stated that my order had been cancelled and didn_'_t know why .

0	the next_day i called them at 0000 having not heard_anything .
0	danny the cust service rep stated he needed to place a new order and it would be delivered on thursday between_0am - 0pm , i did this as i thought it was a 0 off .

0	never again will i shop with best buy .
0	i cancelled all orders and shopped elsewhere .

0	i booked a motel in cape cod , ma for one night through_expedia .
0	when i reached the place there was no one at the front desk and i found out that the motel had been shut for months because it did not have a license to run !
0	also , it was dirty and disgusting to look at , not worth more than $_00 per night and i had paid $_000 to expedia fo rthis shit hole !
0	it was a busy weekend and i spent the next 0 hrs looking for a place to stay .
0	so i went to the cape for an overnigth trip and the night got ruined because by the time i found a place , everything had closed ... not even dinner !
0	so basically expedia does not have any stock of the places they offer to people and they charge crazy prices for shitty places .
0	order arrived very quickly 0_days after ordering .
0	would recommend to others .
0	started going to concerts with songkick again
0	i have bough insurance via this site and then received a call to clarify details .
0	it turns_out that i chose wrong option that i store my bike on a secure car_park instead of a garage , which i had to choose as i didn_'_t have any other options on the site .
0	they were unable to change it with current usurer and claimed that i can either pay extra £_000 to get insurance from another company or cancel it with fee 00_% cancellation_fee .
0	how on earth insurer can '_t offer broker option to amend such a trival detail , incredible nonsense !
0	new anon '_s goggles cost me £_00 less_than on official burton '_s site
0	are a secure and fast shop veey recocomended !
0	i have ordered twice with deramores and both_times have been flawless shopping_experiences .
0	the yarns are fantastic quality at great prices and there are always bargains to be had and great offers to take_advantage of .
0	i would not_hesitate to recommend them to anyone and everyone who knits or crochets and i can '_t wait to do more shopping .
0	in fact i '_m hoping santa knows about the site too !
0	!
0	been customer now for up to 0yrs .
0	n order was reported to be dispatched my account was debited_immediately yet for 0wks + no items came through despite my chasing up costomer service for status_updates which were rather sketchy in the end with no cogent explanation and after 0wks or more i had to ask for my refund because they insisted the goods were still on their way ?!
0	i was really let_down to say the least .
0	when i booked my 0 tyres for £_00 which came to £_00 in the end , i was very happy , but a couple of days_later i noticed on my bank_balance that national had double charged me .
0	i called them up immediately and demanded a refund .
0	they agreed and said it was a mistake .
0	i waited 0_days for it to go through to my bank but it hadn_'_t at all .
0	so i called up again and angrily requested a refund again , wondering_why they hadn_'_t done it already , aparently ' the refund hadn_'_t been requested ' but i finally reached an agreement and they agreed to put the refund through again .
0	by the next thursday , two_weeks after they double charged me , the money was in my bank .
0	i am a student , and having that amount of money withdrawn from my account was painful for the two_weeks .
0	i expected more from national as the service at the shop was great and the ease of access on the website was very good .
0	i will not be using national again .
0	i got my first pair of glasses in primary_school and eventually moved on to contacts when i was in my 00 '_s .
0	my eyes were constantly dry and irritated due to working in dusty environments so i contacted optical_express , went for a consultation and was recommended to have the intralase lasik .
0	it was the most expensive surgery but completely suited to my lifestyle and work .
0	i was pretty nervous when i went for the surgery but the staff were great at reassuring me and answered all of my questions so i soon relaxed .
0	they spoke to me throughout the procedure making_sure i knew what was going to happen next and checking i was okay .
0	the surgery was completely pain_free and very quick .
0	the after care was great , giving clear and concise_instructions on the different eye_drops to use , the goggles and also advice on what to do if i started to feel discomfort beyond normal levels .
0	the easy 0 year payment plan was also great and affordable @ £_00 a month , not causing any shortages elsewhere .
0	i '_ve recommended friends and family , great experience .
0	nothing can compare to the morning after when i could see without glasses or contacts ... amazing !
0	i placed my order just before 0pm and it was dispatched immediately .
0	very informative website and dedicated to their customers .
0	not the first purchase i '_ve made from them but very impressed their standards haven_'_t slipped .
0	recommend this company to everyone
0	i have been an o0 customer for 0 years & never had a problem until now .
0	i paid my bill on the 0th of april & they then tried to take it again on the 0th of april , the money was not in my bank so i was left with a £_00 bank charge (£_00 for unarranged overdraft & £_00 for being over drawn ) i asked o0 to refund me the £_00 as it was their mistake & they have refused !!
0	me & my 0 year_old_son went for four days with no money .
0	the customer service i received by phone was very very poor , the service i received by chat was excellent .
0	however , i still_haven_'_t be refunded the money .
0	only gave 0_star because it wouldn_'_t let_me rate 0_stars .
0	i '_ve_used serenata a few_times and have always been impressed with the punctual nature of the service though of late i '_ve taken time to read the emails and had to chuckle to myself .
0	i would gladly use them again and i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend them to other people .
0	a top_class service with a dash of humour thrown in .
0	dropped my samsung off for a new screen on my way to work , on my way home , collected it , and it looked like a whole new phone !
0	very good service , answered any_questions i had regarding the repair , and was the cheapest place i could find .

0	would recommend without_hesitation ! i '_m now a regular customer !
0	i have not had any_issues at all and was very impressed with how quickly i received my products .
0	would definitely use again .
0	within a week of placing my order i received my glasses , perfect !
0	the option for a free home_trial is amazing , i used this many_times before finally placing an order !
0	and it was cheap compared to the high_street_opticians .
0	would definitely recommend to everyone !
0	fantastic service , only problem for me having astigmatism , i sometimes have to wait a bit longer for my prescription .
0	but fantastic delivery times and would definitely buy from again and again !
0	i love shopping here and return over and over again because they stock all my favourite_brands , the prices are very reasonable with some great deals and discounts always available , delivery is fast and free , and they provide a very reliable service ( plus excellent customer service for when things do occasionally go_wrong ).

0	thank_you :)

0	i '_ve_used discount supplements a few_times_now and each time my order has_been delivered next_day on the dot .. compared to a few others ( even some that are local ' ish to me ) ive always had my order on time ...
0	i wouldnt use anyone_else now , unless someone opened a local shop that sold the same products at the same cost .. and i cannot see that happening ...
0	i '_ve_used shopto . net for quite a while now and i '_m a gold member , they used to be excellent , but it seems that recent changes have them neglect their old values of customer_care when an issue arises .
0	their recently added shoptonews section seems to be a copy and paste of other gaming sites news and the reviews are mediocre to say the least .
0	their blog used to be more reliable
0	super price , very fast delivery will be using again !
0	my customer experience with gearforgirls was fantastic - the website is well set_up and easy to use and the product arrived very promptly .
0	unfortunately the product wasn_'_t suitable so i had to return it .

0	i was given some excellent advice on which blu_ray player to buy and it was then sent out to me promptly and payment online was straightforward .
0	i would use weybridge_audio again .
0	i am honestly so happy i found a cheap place to buy supplements .
0	i have seen other_places that may be a couple dollars cheaper , but in the end they really are not because the cost of shipping is way too high .
0	the customer service is also awesome !
0	ordered 0 signs , was contacted and recommended some changes that would benefit the overall outlook of the product , very nice lady made changes for me and checked i approved , then prompt delivery .

0	i have used this online company everytime i book accommodation .
0	recently travelled around_europe and only booked a day before i decided where we were going and they always had the best price and hassel_free .
0	they have a great range of locations ( only had to go to local sources when you get a little off the beaten_track ).
0	i ordered as a thank_you gift , the price for the amount of flowers was very reasonable and the bouquet beautiful .
0	from order placement to delivery the communication was excellent and highly personalised to my order .
0	all was delivered without a hitch and both myself and the recipient are delighted .
0	many_thanks .
0	booked a ski_holiday to france with lastminute .
0	it says transfers are 0 hours but i didn_'_t realise that transfers are not incuded .
0	not only that but there are no transfers to the resort from any company whatsover .
0	the only way to get there is a taxi costing_£_000 ( more than the holiday ).
0	i don_'_t mind that transfers are an extra but selling a holiday that is not actually even possible to go on seems not on at all .
0	also , after phoning them they said they would ring back to find me transfers but didn_'_t and i had to ring them again a week_later .
0	i now have to book a seperate flight as this is cheaper_than ammending my flight .
0	avoid !
0	!
0	i do love the clothes ive bought jumpers , skirts and coats oh and boots , all lasted well and washed well ( appart from boots lol ) but the items are sooo pricey i usually wait for the sales
0	i love doing my shopping online , as i hate queues and pushing etc you get in supermarkets .
0	the items are well priced , delivery drivers always happy and i once had a problem with bad veg sent in my shop and they refunded me no problem :) thanks asda
0	i think their items need a warning that peanuts are used alot in some of their other products !
0	and since theyve told me its all produced in a small open factory i can understand_why my 0 year_old was scratching at his swelling face in the bath .
0	poor show lush
0	my 0 year_olds allergic to peanuts , after checking the packaging we brought him some shower jelly from here .
0	as soon as he used it he reacted ive contacted them , i dont want anything from them just for them to put a warning in their shop or on the packaging that they use alot of peanuts in their other items but they arent interested unless they get other people complain of it ??
0	its life threatening so i dont take this attitude very well im affraid
0	the websites easy to use , has tonnes of present ideas , look out for there free delivery codes or money off codes they do regularly .
0	products arrive well_packaged and dont take long to arrive
0	never been disapointed with play , my items arrive fast and the prices are cheaper most of the time as i shop around alot to get the best deal
0	i use ebay alot and over 0 years have only had one problem .
0	i think its a ggreat idea and well_laid_out .
0	the staff are great in my local_store so friendly and always_willing to help .
0	ours is a small store but its crammed with everything you need
0	update on my account , after the tonnes of interest i had , it got to the point it was getting ridiculous i couldnt pay it back £ 0000 in fact so i got a loan out at 00_% which is loads better_than very .
0	i paid them in full yesterday , still snotty woman over the phone ' why couldnt you pay this before ?'
0	my reply simply ' didnt have the money '!!
0	did she think i wanted to just bump up all there ridiculous charges or something ??
0	anyway i said i wanted to close my account she tried 0 times to get me to buy something i said no you must be joking , so she said call back tommorrow to close .
0	so today i call and im on hold ages , again get told i could buy something_else , and this time i told her what a sham of a company it is now its very and sugested she googled the reviews .... then got told i cant close my account til monday !!
0	does anyone know if they can do this ?
0	have reccomended mazuma to friends and family already .
0	the website is really easy to use , everything you need to do to send the phones arrives really fast .
0	they email you to let you know all was well and they also let you know when they post your cheque .
0	cant_fault this company , we will use them again .
0	totally like my shopping_experience with shoetique
0	some updates ...
0	after the terrible experience yesterday , i contacted dx and they arranged another delivery for me today .
0	also , i sent the complain group an_email described what happened on the day .
0	well , nobody replied .
0	but till 0 :_00pm today , nothing arrived .
0	i called the helpline , the automatic system still told me my passport would be delivered today .
0	i finally got it transformed to human service .
0	a staff firstly told me i would receive my passport late this evening ... and then i asked him where is my passport now .
0	he took quite a while to trace my passport and told me a following shocking new : my passport is still in the hand of the same delivery guy , but he refuses to deliver to my place .
0	because he reported i attacked him yesterday !
0	also , he claimed i am not the owner of my passport or the female who answered the door !
0	nobody can_imagine how shocked i was .
0	i attacked him ?
0	how ?!!
0	i am a tiny little woman less 000cm attacking a over 000cm guy ?
0	why ?
0	i am not the owner of the passport ?
0	how can he tell ?
0	i do not even feel angry , it sounds more like a joke !
0	the most ridiculous thing is dx sounds_like believes this liar staff .
0	they told me because the guy did not want to deliver my passport so that i must go to their depot centre to collect it myself !
0	how funny !
0	first of all , i remember i paid for the delivery and it is not cheap !
0	second , if i am not going to receive my passport today , why didn_'_t dx arrange the delivery today and the information is still on their system ?!
0	third , when will they inform_me the situation of my passport if i did not call for details ?
0	i really cannot stand such a irresponsible treatment and bear such a lie !
0	i do not mind taking any legal_action to protect my right as a custom !
0	my whole day was totally_ruined by the unprofessional and rude service provided by dx !
0	most_importantly , i have to rearrange my delivery for another day , which means i have to take another day off !
0	i do not even understand_why the us embassy chooses such a terrible courier .
0	i do not even want my us visa if the dx is in charge of delivery .
0	the driver was terribly rude and impatient and showed no manner .
0	he refused to give me my passport because i keep him waiting for 0mins !
0	i did apologise for not bringing my id proof at the first time and tried to bring it asap .
0	for 0 mins , he just could not wait .
0	but he spent 0mins to criticize me wasting his time !
0	the reason he finally refused to give me my passport was he did not trust my id proof , which is my uk residence permit .
0	but interesting , he did not even check it or asked for another proof he trust !!
0	also , he actually already handed me the signature machine to sign !
0	i have signed it twice !
0	i found hifi_headphones to be an excellent service with good communication_throughout the whole_process .
0	dispatch of the item was very quick and i am very pleased with my new head phones .
0	would definitely use again and would recommend to friends and family .
0	thanks once again .
0	deborah
0	brilliant service and delivery from this company
0	a friend recommended mydriver to me and i have used them several_times , to and from the airport and eurostar .
0	they have always been on time , been incredibly polite helping_me with my bags and got me where i was going in a decent time .
0	they are also cheaper_than other alternatives such as g0 and taxis which is an added_bonus !
0	i ordered the flowers the night before for my nan and they arrived as promised the next_day .
0	she was so pleased with them for her_birthday and said that they were really unusual and beautiful !
0	i ordered aztec sun flowers .
0	thank_you so much !
0	did an online course on sage , was very easy to use with clear_instructions .
0	would definitely recommend it to those who are looking to have a good knowledge of sage or to boost your cv as you will learn many things .
0	i trust top_cash_back and is 000_% the best cash_back site .
0	the interface is as easy as pie , even my mum uses it now .
0	plus if there isn_'_t any cash_back for a website , there is usually a discount_code available that is displayed on the same page .
0	waited in all day , once again , and has not turned_up .
0	according to the tracking they have , once again , managed to not ' gain_access to the property '.
0	there is a blue picket fence separating the road and my front_door .
0	as well as the fact that the first day that they tried , even_though they wernt meant to come , they managed to over - come that trouble some 0ft front_gate and post a delivery card through the letter_box .
0	maybe they got too scared to go back through the gate on the way out and are still lurking around my front_garden somewhere .....
0	what can i say 000_% happy :-) the week before christmas i found incrystals , thinking oh i have left it a bit late , it prob wont get here on time , but i was sooo wrong i ordered 0 different products all with different pictures on the monday and they arrieved by thursday and i wasnt disappointed , i am made up with them and cant_wait to see my loved ones faces when they open them on christmas day .
0	fantastic prices , i wouldnt_hesitate in making a order with them again and to tell everyone about this company , one very happy customer will be dealing_with incrystals again in the future :-)
0	really prompt response , cheque was with me in no time .
0	my new favourite website .
0	thank_you .
0	booked 0 tickets to see wet wet wet at the 00 in december booked them in october i was quite sceptical from reading some of the reviews but i had nothing to worry_about .
0	i spoke to the customer_services as i had booked the tickets for a birthday_present i wanted a confirmation letter so i could wrap it up they sent me a lovely letter with a picture of the band which was a lovely service .
0	i received a text_message to say my tickets had been dispatched and were being sent recorded delivery .
0	i recived the tickets the next_day .
0	we had really good seats exactly were i had booked brilliant seats amazing night i will defiantly use double 0 tickets again and will encourage friends and family to use the also xxxx
0	well i ordered some flowers for my fellow business owner '_s studio launch as a " good luck " not a problem for saturday delivery .
0	however , 0 :_00pm i recieved a telephone_call to state that they were unable to deliver the flowers , and they could try again for monday .
0	unfortunately her launch party was today ( saturday ) and not monday .
0	disappointment is an_understatement , i am so unbelievely upset that something nice i was trying to do for someone is completely thrown back into my face - they can offer me a refund , which is fine , but it doesnt rectify the situation .
0	or the poor service .
0	if they had called me earlier this morning , then i may have been able to find someone_else to deliver them .
0	i will never order via these_guys again .
0	booking through prestigia was fine at first but after ringing the hotel to confirm booking realized the amount i would be paying was an extra 00_% each night for government taxes which is not advertised in the original price , or on the confirmation_email witch already states vat has_been paid .
0	why not include all the rates been charged instead of been misleading in your adverts .
0	i have enjoyed using hostelbookers for many_years_now for my international travels .
0	even when i find the same places available through other travel sites , i prefer to come_back to hostelbookers based on all my good experiences in the past .
0	keep_up the good work !
0	i love beauty_bay , it is my ' go to ' site for my beauty needs , whether for skincare or makeup .
0	the plus point for me , is that i can get either the luxury products i require or the basics .
0	they also offer an efficient delivery service .
0	i needed to transfer a lot of old photo negatives to positives onto my laptop and then print them .
0	the one i bought from hi_fi tower worked_fine and was very easy to use .
0	i am extemely satisfied with the ability to save previous_orders to " re - order ".
0	it takes the hassle out of shopping when you already know what you want .
0	i was a little leary when i started receiving packages of loose energy shots vs . the sealed 00pks i was getting .
0	however , there were always an exact number of products ordered .... and always of satisfactory quality as well .
0	i continue to order from supllementwarehouse . com b /_c of convenience and quality ..... good buy for the buck ... and consistently !
0	i have been a quidco member for about 0 years and i have earned a substantial_amount of cashback !
0	i use it for changing my energy_supplier and home insurance_renewal to buying my groceries and christmas_presents !
0	it is so easy to use and customer service is fantastic as they keep me up to take with my tracked cashback and let_me know they are working on it if it is taking too long to be paid !
0	i recommend to everybody !
0	!
0	i ordered a pair of tyres online .
0	the delivery was fast , and they updated me automatically on the state of my order ,
0	all in all a great service !
0	the guy i spoke to ( bob i believe ) was really friendly and gave_me lots of examples of when i could or couldn_'_t make a claim .
0	i decided to place an order through takeaway . com after_seeing the £ 0 off deal , i wish i '_d never bothered !
0	firstly , the £ 0 code didn_'_t work .
0	secondly after i '_d placed my order i got a call from the restaurant saying he '_d been informed not to prepare the order as my payment hadn_'_t been verified ...
0	i checked my bank , the money had gone .
0	he said he '_d call me back in 0 minutes after checking with takeaway . com , he said they were refunding my payment so could i pay over the phone .
0	desperate to just get the food i paid for the order ... again ... with the promise one of my payments would be refunded .
0	i then complained on the takeaway . com website and got 0 calls within 00_minutes from 0 different people who said they would ' check out my story and consider the refund !!'
0	i pointed_out it was not up for negotiation and also they should give me the extra £ 0 back since that wasn_'_t working either !
0	he flat out refused to give me the £ 0 off and blamed a ' technical_error '.
0	the restaurant were not to blame in this and the food was lovely but takeaway . com need a proper sorting_out !
0	their technical problems aren_'_t my fault and the fact it '_s going to take 0 - 00 days to refund my money deserves some sort of compensation .
0	none was offered .
0	i shan '_t be using this service again .
0	i have used technogroom several_times and always had a fast and efficient service .
0	i has a slight_problem with a blade i purchased but they replaced it without_question and gave_me advice , and it turned_out it was my clippers reaction the blade that was the problem , not the blade itself .
0	all the staff i have spoken to have been very helpful and friendly .
0	i would use technogroom as a first choice everytime .
0	impressed with the substantial discounts available and as a dog_groomer i regularly buy from the site .
0	have highly_recommended it to everyone !
0	ordered both wickerman and dnd toilet tickets for wickerman from skiddle .
0	the staff were great and informative .
0	it was so quick got my tickets right away so i didnt have to worry_about no one being home to sign for a recorded delivery envelope !
0	look_forward to using them in the future !
0	:_o_)
0	super easy service to use .
0	confirmation came through quickly .
0	description and ratings of hostel were accurate !!
0	!
0	would definitely recommend and definitely use again !
0	:)
0	i bought the costumes for world_book day for me and some colleagues .
0	the range and price of the costumes are all very good as well as the quality of the costumes .
0	would not_hesitate to use mega_fancy_dress for future occasions , thank_you !
0	this is one of my favorite website !
0	awesome products !
0	no problem .
0	good price , good package and very fast !
0	i will order again , for sure !
0	do not use locauto at milan malpensa unless you find waiting in 0 queues for over 0 hours acceptable to pick_up your car .
0	then don_'_t bother complaining to rentalcars . com when you get back as they will basically call you a liar and just offer you a discount on your next car_hire .
0	erh , i don_'_t think i '_ll be bothering thanks .
0	endless problems with talk_talk over the last 0_months , had over 0 engineers to house and every one has_been incapable of solving the problem of minimal speeds ( 0 . 0mb !)
0	and unstable connection which constantly cuts out .
0	when first sold talk_talk over phone mid september they said we would have internet 00hrs after receiving router .
0	a few_days_later engineer came to activate line but no router , then received later saying wed have to wait a further 00 days !!
0	then a further 00_hrs etc etc and we did not have working internet until end of october !
0	but few_days_later line went dead !!
0	so still not internet well into november .
0	this is only the beginning , since then numerous engineer visits , apparent faulty routers , new wiring , new sockets , list_goes on .
0	it is now the end of february and we still experience these problems .
0	icing_on the cake - needed to speak to engineering team , technical_support said they could not put me through and asked me to phone back using the same options i had used before ( i told him this and he thought i was wrong ).
0	phoned back and got through to the same technical_support_team !
0	wasting another fifteen_minutes after being put on hold etc .
0	useless - i could do better and i am a girl !
0	talk_talk are incompetant , barely understandable on phone once you get past the automated_systems .
0	even the managers are useless .
0	they are absolute con_merchants please stay away !!!!
0	this isnt even half of the story .
0	be warned .
0	by distressed third year student - unable to do work half the time as internet barely works .
0	i had my laser_surgery a year_ago and i was nervous_about it but the staff made me feel comfortable and fully_informed from the first appointment .
0	every_stage was explained to me before anything was done and the staff have always been very friendly .
0	i am so glad that i had it done as everything went_smoothly and my vision is great now .
0	i have not had any_problems and think that having the surgery improved my life as i am able to play with my daughter more easily and without_fear that i would drop my glasses or that she would break them .
0	i have my friends and family about my experience and recommend optical_express to people considering_laser_surgery .
0	i '_ve not purchased an awful_lot from yesstyle but when i have done , it '_s been pretty quick and i '_ve never had any_problems .
0	i think their member scheme is also really handy and is a good way to get people to purchase from them more .
0	i personally love the clothing they sell , even if i can only buy from certain brands ( due to sizing ), but the fact that they sell clothes from asian brands that are for plus size makes them even better .
0	it '_s hard to find the cute asian - style clothing in a size that fits me so when i see there are actual brands out there that have stuff that '_ll fit me , at a reasonable_price too , makes me very happy to buy from them .
0	never_heard of this company but cheap and swift delivery !
0	many_thanks .
0	i '_d like to add what an effecient service ive received - after_spending weeks trying to find such a reputable and reliable service i am glad i picked yourselves .
0	no where on the internet has reviews on such services and i have recommended you , very fast and honest !
0	( well he would be if i ran the company !)
0	a huge thank_you to ben who has spent time and effort resolving a problem with the delivery of my parcels .
0	he was very professional , courteous and a credit to your customer service team .
0	thanks ben !
0	wendy
0	easy to do online and payment recieved fast
0	got my pack the next_day after_placing my sell order .
0	i popped my two phones in the post ( i did through the post_office to get proof of posting ) and got the money transferred_into my account on the next working day .
0	so simple and fast to use .
0	only_thing is the post bag , postage is paid but the bag has no protection for the phones so i wrapped mine in a little left over bubble_wrap just to make_sure they did not get damaged on the way .
0	we have used ozmedia now for many_years as a trusted supplier and printer .
0	we find that whilst the standards are high the service is second to none .
0	they always go out if there way to find a solution or help .
0	as a charitable organisation values are important to us and ozmedia '_s values complement ours in many ways .
0	i would have no_hesitation in recommending them for print or design .
0	a part of me feels my input isn_'_t even needed with all the bad_reviews but it '_s been such a hassle !
0	me and my partner moved_into a new flat .
0	i '_ve always been a british_gas customer and had no_problems with them ever .
0	so we switched to them , as the flat was already being supplied by scottish_power ( a company i '_d never even heard of anyway ).
0	contacted british_gas to switch , got that all sorted .
0	shortly_after got our " final_bill " from sp .
0	the bill started about 0_weeks before we '_d even signed the tenancy_agreement and was for an amount that was about double what i '_d expect our usage to be .
0	tried to use the details on the bill to log in online , as my experience with bg taught me that '_s the easiest_way to sort things like this .
0	put in all the details correctly and then it just came up saying i couldn_'_t access the account .
0	i '_m not a fan of phone_calls anyway ( and by the sound of all the other reviews it wouldn_'_t have done anything !)
0	and it took me a bloody age to find an e_- mail address .
0	through the sp site , the only way i could find to message or e_- mail them was if i could log in to my account , which i couldn_'_t .
0	took me a google_search of " scottish_power complaints contact e_- mail " to find anything .
0	finally sent an e_- mail out to them , got an_automated_response .
0	a few_weeks passed and i started getting letters from a company called lcs , saying there was an investigation_into my bill .
0	i thought " oh yay , this is sp sorting it out for me ", little did i know .
0	after sending lcs the details they '_d asked for , i waited .
0	next contact , again about a week or so later , i was called by them , saying i still needed to pay the bill .
0	i explained to the man on the phone everything i had already e_- mail to both sp and lcs .
0	he told me to e_- mail a scan of my tenancy_agreement to the lcs address and that i would hear from them again within a few_days , hopefully with the amount to be paid corrected .
0	i got no such contact from lcs .
0	what i did get ( finally ) was an e_- mail from sp '_s margaret doyle , a lovely woman_who told me she '_d been assigned to my case and that my bill amount had been corrected ( about halved in fact !).
0	she asked me to provide a number and a time that would be convenient for her to call me so i can give her my payment details and get the whole_thing sorted !
0	i gave her a lot of thanks as i '_ve had months of stressing over this and just wanting it sorted .
0	i will note i had to email her again to remind her to call me , but i can understand that people are busy , it '_s not always easy to remember things .
0	she was very friendly and polite ( apparently unlike all the customer service drones ) and i made the payment .
0	the main pain about this whole_thing is it took from november 0th until december 00th to get sorted !
0	how can it take over a month for something to be resolved !
0	i mean if they want their money so badly that they '_ve gone to a debt_collectors to threaten me , then why won_'_t they respond any faster ?
0	i will say i have received a final demand letter from lcs , but i only paid 0_days ago , and so they must have just not got the memo yet .
0	i would like to go on about the lcs company , who i have a lot more problems with , but of course that '_s not for this page .
0	let '_s just say i '_ll be relieved once this is resolved and i can finally get back to using a company that i have never had to take this kind of bs from .
0	very good service would use again .
0	0 out of 0 for service xxxx
0	we booked a hotel at heathrow ( sheraton skyline ) for the night before our flight and parking at the hotel while we were away .
0	the price we paid was very reasonable and the hotel was very nice .
0	the website was easy to use and there were lots of different deals available for us to choose from , with good explanations and photos of the hotel rooms .
0	our booking went through with no_problems .
0	i would definitely use holiday extras again .
0	all the resources the site has available were helpful in deciding the best option for my one night stay in the city of london .
0	i was looking for a fairly cheap , good quality , great location hostel that would allow me to enjoy my stay .
0	thanks !
0	i use hostelbookers frequently for booking accomodation when traveling .
0	their website is easy to use and navigate , their low_prices , useful reviews and maps are other reasons_why i book with hostelbookers .
0	plus they don_'_t charge bookingfees .
0	excellent service !
0	i love this place !
0	i used to go to gnc for all my suppliments and end up spending rediculous amounts and walking out with a couple items .
0	then i found supplementwarehouse and i recieve several items for the price of one and the best part about it is it gets shipped straight to my door faster_than any other company .
0	they have great products for the cheepest prices .
0	all ive got to say is ; be smart and save_yourself some money .
0	:)
0	i found this service online after i smashed my screen and phone stopped_working entirely .
0	a technician came out the next_day and fixed the screen , and the on / off button at no extra_charge .
0	incredibly efficient , friendly and really cheap !!
0	i '_ll definitely be using them again .
0	i am very happy with this web_site and support i am recieving .
0	everywhere in the world i can make a booking and in 0 minutes or even less .
0	it is very easy to use my phone for booking .
0	also i recieved their international call whenever i request something special .
0	really excellent web_site and this is from heart .
0	i ordered the package in october and it is now december , my package has still not arrived .
0	i contacted customer service and they said they were confirming for a resend , the next_day they sent a partial_refund .
0	they said i would get a full_refund .
0	which has yet to appear in my bank_account .
0	terrible .
0	i have had a terrible time with ccl computers so far and unfortunately its still ongoing since i placed my ( not insignificant ) order a month_ago .
0	firstly the delivery was a week late ( expected some delay after_reading_reviews ) and it was an inconvenience but forgivable .
0	they didn_'_t ring me to tell me it wasn_'_t arriving on the stated date / time and i had to ring them up - after i had already taken a day off work .
0	i asked why it was late and ( the very nice ) noel told me that they were waiting on a part and i should have been notified .
0	a few_days_later i ring again but this time it is two different parts they are " waiting " for .
0	amazingly , they eventually " found " the parts and all is good .
0	my computer arrived and it was ok .
0	slower_than i expected given the spec , but it worked .
0	but now , two_weeks after the computer arrived it has randomly shut_down and it will not even begin to restart after showing a whea_uncorrectable_error .
0	the computer is being picked_up on monday for repair .
0	if i didn_'_t need a decent home computer for work reasons i would get a refund and just buy another - but i cant_wait a month for them to re - credit my account .
0	i am very nervous_about the quality / duration of the repair and hope that everything goes according to plan .
0	they said it will take 0 working_days but who_knows ...
0	noel ( customer_services ) has_been as helpful as ( i assume ) he could have been .
0	so although i don_'_t have a problem with the customer service i do feel that i have a justified problem with the quality of product , the delivery time , the manufacturing and product testing .
0	i would not recommend ccl to others .
0	perhaps they are ok if you are just ordering a component ... but you can probably find it cheaper elsewhere .
0	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0	update
0	the repair took twice as long as they estimated and they re - delivered the computer to the billing rather_than delivery address ( on the other side of the country ) .
0	do not ring / get put through to their customer service number
0	they always put you on hold for 00mins or so .
0	here is the email for customer_services if you need to contact them and don_'_t fancy a surprise £_00 . 00 phone bill :
0	customerservice @ cclonline . com
0	think i '_ve spent about £_000 so far over last month - buy all my protein_powder , fibre powder and spirulina powder from bulk_powders now .
0	prices are really good and delivery always received within 0_days .
0	the print materials looked great , and i could take_advantage of a couple of special_offers to keep prices low ( but still with fsc - certified paper , which is important for us ).
0	matt was very helpful in getting jobs back on time to meet tight_deadlines .
0	i would recommend printing . com cambridge to anyone looking for an efficient and good quality service .
0	i browsed several sites getting quotes for recycling my macbook , and sell your laptop both offered the best price and had best ratings of all the sites .
0	i was a bit_nervous_about sending off my laptop but found the whole_process very simple and quick - they sent me the packaging within a couple of days , i took it to the post_office and a couple of days_later i received confirmation that they had received the laptop .
0	a few hours_later i had an_email_saying that they were sending me the money , and it was in my account the same day .
0	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend this service to friends and family , and will definitely use it in the future .
0	exactly as_described , paperwork , emails very informative - done exactly_what was said wil use again
0	perfect , and great offer price - really pleased
0	also delivery was alot_quicker_than_expected
0	really looking_forward to michael_buble at the o0 .
0	ordered the seats ages_ago and received them in the post today - superb seats !
0	!
0	thank_you
0	clive
0	always excellent offers , food piping_hot & friendly delivery drivers .
0	i have never used menkind before , in fact i had never_heard of them .
0	but while_searching for that illusive gift for my brother that every high_street store had sold out of , i stumbled_upon it at menkind .
0	ordering quick & efficient , delivery was swift when paid for & i also had a package delivered under the free delivery option as well , which came well within the 0_days stated .
0	products where well_packed , which i have found to be a problem with other on - line stores , and came in perfect_condition .
0	i will be using menkind again , i have not found the products i bought cheaper anywhere on line .
0	fab website , it made comparing broadband packages really easy and has saved me loads !
0	definitely recommend !
0	unfortunately my parcel went missing & after being investigated it could not be found .
0	philip marsh , executive service co - ordinator was very helpful and is very good at his job .
0	i signed_up for the 00 day free trial through amazon_prime .
0	i never normally sign up for these types of services but i had heard good things about love_film .
0	i decided not to continue with the trial before the 00 days were up and attempted to cancel my membership .
0	this proved to be very difficult .
0	there was no clear way of cancelling the subscription and in the end i had to google how to do it , whilst doing so i found an_abundance of disgruntled_customers having the same issues and whole forums devoted to the topic .
0	i eventually found a way of doing it and pressed the appropriate button which said ' cancel instant prime post by membership '.
0	i didn_'_t get an_email_confirmation so i logged back into the account to check and sure enough it said i no_longer had a subscription .
0	0_months later i was checking my bank_statements and there was 0 charges for £ 0 . 00 for prime instant video for the last 0_months .
0	i called the customer service call_centre which again i had to google to find the number as yet again it is not made clear anywhere on the website .
0	i was told by the advisor that although yes i had cancelled my postal service i had to cancelled my instant love_film streaming subscription , something which i never signed_up for and and something which was not made clear i even had on my account .
0	i was absolutely_furious that this company are clearly deceiving customers in this way .
0	i will never use this company again and hope that anyone reading this does not fall into the same trap .
0	with the price and speed as it is , i was worried the product wouldn_'_t be of good quality but it is .
0	perfect for my exhibition , couldn_'_t be_happier , and ordered another straight_away .
0	bought two of their herbal blend teas , both are lovely , exactly_what i was after , and at a great price with quick delivery also !
0	thank_you !
0	i '_ve been searching for a decent food supplier that will deliver in a timed_slot ( rather_than at just some point , one day a week ).
0	well now i '_ve found tilia and couldn_'_t be_happier - the food is amazing , the service even better .
0	and the amount of vegetables and salad i received in the seasonal boxes was much more than i expected .
0	very excited that hunt is finally over !
0	thanks .
0	yesstyle is absolutely one of my favourite websites to shop at .
0	the first thing i do when i '_m feeling bored of my old clothes is look on yesstyle .
0	i even have it at my bookmarks bar because i surf it so often even if it is to be on top of new asian fashion .
0	the reason_why i use yesstyle so much is because , i love shopping in hong_kong , every time i shop there i get my hands full of bags and i have to put down all of them at a hotel just to go out and shop more but with yesstyle , i don_'_t have to do all of that because it is all just on one website and the shipping is so fast that you don_'_t even expect it .
0	what i especially love is how yesstyle always have a sale on no matter the season .
0	so if you ' re looking for some asian style , yesstyle has everything you '_ll ever need on it !
0	decent service and at a great price was pleased with it all .
0	collection and delivery was done in the timescales and the garage were really nice ,.
0	im just happy that i have found a brand that i feel i can_trust so i will recommend to my friends and family .
0	will buy again !
0	thanks to david for his quick response and very helpful support .
0	left the conversation feeling 000_% clear on where to go and what to do .
0	i don_'_t know where to begin with amazon .
0	let_me just say , that it '_s my no0 choice on online buying .
0	i haven_'_t been a member of pph community for long but i '_m loving their new service , hourlies .
0	it is very easy to post an hourlie there and start working .
0	actually i signed_up to post my hourlie and i '_m just getting started with sending proposals in jobs posted .
0	what i like the most is the option of pausing your hourlies when you have lots of work and re - enabling them when you are available .
0	kituout are very efficient and the quality of the products is great .
0	a quick turn_around and friendly service is provided , great prices and overall very happy customers !
0	highly_recommended !
0	georgous chocolate
0	not bad would reccomend tho
0	good but could of been better
0	i prefere i phone
0	delivery is amazing on time and well_packaged .
0	there website is well_structured and smart .
0	there shops and tidy and clothes and shoes are good prices for good quality clothing also there is a shop next to nothing and they sell old next produce for cheap really good .
0	highly_reccomend
0	i don_'_t really like to shop in tesco although there fruit and veg is good , but i have found horrible bits of meat in pasta pots ect and there was an orange fly in a packet of crisps i brought in a meal deal .
0	the produce is not worth the money and its very exspensive you dont get your_moneys worth .
0	same story as everyone else .
0	i called the contact number for them listed on this site ( different to their website ) and spoke to mike who has assured me that i will receive a refund within 0 - 0 banking days .
0	watch this space ....
0	i was a little_skeptical having been stung by online pc building sites before , but i cannot_fault the service and final_result provided by cyberpower .
0	their sales_team were friendly , the pc was ready quickly and performs incredibly well .
0	i '_ve already_recommended them to all my friends looking for an upgrade !
0	excellent service , really helpful could tell they were doing everything they could to fix my laptop !
0	got it back within a day as good as new and at a really decent price !
0	thoroughly_recommend 0000rpm and wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else if i need assistance again !
0	special thanks to ian for his help and advice !
0	fast delivery , comunicated really well great product .
0	the kids_love it
0	love my new coat .
0	use it daily fast service great quality
0	fast service
0	buy quite a lot from there - it '_s quite refreshing to see a big retailer often offering discount_codes and free delivery .
0	i '_ve only ever returned one item which was painless so yes i would recommend !
0	wow .
0	bad bad bad_experience , didn_'_t expect it from a popular retailer .
0	firstly they have overcharged my card from the orders i placed , they have taken a higher payment than the payment that i authorised and i have e_-_mails to prove this - i '_ve been told this is illegal but anyway , i haven_'_t even received the items that i '_ve been overcharged for , i '_ve e_- mailed twice - no reply , called , was on hold for 00_minutes and had other things to do so had to leave it , yet someone has loads of time to tweet me back to say to contact the customer_services - what '_s the point - maybe that person could actually spend some time replying rather_than being a jobs worth - we can all google the helpline number .
0	definitely won_'_t be using again and judging from all the bad_reviews here a lot of other people won_'_t either , h_& m clearly haven_'_t grasped the online shopping world yet .
0	i '_m not really sure how or why people leave bad_reviews for free money ???
0	if you weren_'_t part of the site you wouldn_'_t get it anyway !
0	excellent website , i '_d recommend to all my friend and family - you '_ve got nothing to lose .
0	great !
0	got a lovely barbour_coat with excellent service !
0	my friend and i bought costumes and hers was delivered with a massive rip in it !
0	as it was the day of the event she had to repair it , mine came looking nothing like the picture with accessories that would only fit a child .
0	it took us both several e_-_mails and posting on their facebook to get a reply and even then the solutions weren_'_t what i would deem as reasonable .
0	would stay well away in future , massive rip_off .
0	i have mine and my mum '_s contract with them , after a few_months , my phone started cutting off calls every few_minutes as did my mums , they told me both phones must be faulty , so we both now have brand_new phones and still the same - so very expensive ' advice ' from o0 .
0	i have phoned / e_- mailed / live_chat with them and they have more or less just said ' oh well the coverage says ok in your town ' - not offered any sort of solution , it can be seen on my bill that phone_calls constantly cut_off .
0	friends of mine are having the same issue so it is definitely o0s issue .
0	as long as they have your money they don_'_t care !!!
0	!
0	i wish i '_d never ordered !!!
0	next_day delivery took 0_days , 0 e_-_mails later no reply , all the dresses had to be returned - some were faulty .
0	no response no refund .

0	hello pippa i believe i have received an_email from you before amongst the 00 something emails i have sent back and forth being told so many different things by your staff .
0	all i want to know is when on earth am i going to get money back ?
0	i '_ve been told 0 different things by your staff yet not one of them can confirm or give me a straight answer , is what you ' re doing even legal ???
0	advertising next_day delivery but never actually doing it and keeping peoples money ??
0	i want my refund through straight_away , is this why you don_'_t provide a contact number ??!
0	!
0	i spent £_000 on a bodycon dress , wore it once and now its ripped everywhere !
0	wrote to customer service and because i can '_t find my receipt ( despite it having french_connection labels ) refused to do anything about it .. terrible !
0	!
0	further to the comment you just posted as a reply , if i had wanted budget tyres i would have purchased them but i ordered and paid for medium range , your company should have price matched the closest mid range tyre as it was your mistake yet you were not willing to do that .
0	instead you took my money , left me waiting an_hour at the fitting_centre , i booked time off work , used fuel getting there and back and got nothing .
0	i have my mot now that my car will not pass because your company couldn_'_t deliver .
0	i have called and left my details at your complaints_department and had no call back and sent an e_- mail with no reply .
0	says a lot about customer service .
0	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0	reply : the guy at the fitting_centre and the woman on the phone from your company told me that you did have an_alternative tyre in stock but you were not willing to price match .
0	i ordered a bed , it was delivered in two_days , fast delivery service , the bed is perfect , i am really pleased .

0	i bought a balloon ride for my husband from a company on groupon .
0	we were very excited_about the prospect of going up for a ride .
0	over two years i tried booking and rebooking rides , always to be cancelled .
0	the balloon company said there was nothing they could do about the weather and that we could pay anohter 00 . 00 pounds to renew for another year .
0	after yet another year and still no ride i went back to groupon and asked them what they would do about it .
0	i explained that the balloon company would not even let us book a ride unless we had given them our voucher number which would automatically give the balloon company the money for our ride ... even with no ride !
0	since i had all the emails to prove our non_existent ride groupon refunded us the 000 . 00 without_any hassle .
0	i was very impressed considering this was two years on .
0	so i cannot_fault them on their service .
0	the item i ordered was easily ordered with no_problems .
0	just had to answer a few routine questions and it was done .

0	ordered 0 fairly basic rings over the christmas_period after_seeing the advert on hitched .
0	the price was a fraction of that available on the high_street .
0	the rings arrived within a couple of days and were perfect .
0	beautifully_presented in lovely boxes and the insurance_documents were an excellent addition .
0	recommend them to anyone .
0	if i ever have an eternity_ring this is where i '_ll be sending him !
0	!
0	hostelbookers had the cheapest prices and is extremely easy to use .
0	i liked that you could enter in the days you need the room and it finds the availability for you .
0	would definitely recommend to others .
0	my experience with next step_beauty has_been a good one .
0	everything you need to know is in the course and there is help available after you complete the course if needed .
0	the tutor i had for all 0 of the courses i completed was sarah and she was a brilliant tutor who answered any_questions we had and made the training fun but informative .
0	i now have complete_nail_technician , pedicure and spray_tan under my belt and i '_m now a self_employed mobile beauty_therapist .
0	was very disappointed by the flowers i received from my boyfriend through moon_pig !
0	they arrived on time ( the only good part of this review ) but had petals falling_off , black / dead_petals and some were squashed !
0	the day before i had got my boyfriend a £ 0 bunch of flowers as a bit of fun and they looked much_better_than the £_00 bunch !!!
0	even other people thought the £ 0 flowers were the moon_pig ones !
0	my boyfriend felt ashamed even_though it wasn_’_t his fault and was as disgusted as me .
0	we ended_up driving to the local_supermarket ( local being 00 miles_away ) because he felt so bad about them arriving in the condition they were in and wanted to get me a proper bunch .
0	we have taken date and time stamped photos for proof and emailed a complaint and are waiting to hear back from moon_pig .
0	the only_thing we will except is a full_refund and will even send their pathetic flowers back as they are not as_described or fit for purpose !
0	i have never met a company more incompetent than bt !
0	they do not seem to be able to get anything right .
0	hate this company .
0	they never booked appointments and then i get a phone_call with an engineer waiting at my door_step .
0	well congratulations genius !
0	nobody is home because your company neglected to actually book an_appointment .
0	0 month without_any service .
0	the next battle is to explain to some incompetent idiot that they can '_t charge me if they have not been able to deliver any service !!!!!
0	useless .
0	it is companies like these that make the uk a bad place to live and work !
0	placed an order days in_advance !
0	was not delivered on time .
0	family now thinks i do not care and took some convincing that i did make plans for stuff to be delivered .
0	i am mortified that i had to make excuses for something i was prepared for !
0	their customer service dept is horrible .
0	cant phone them , just this silly online thing .
0	it took me throwing my toys to get a delivery charge refund !
0	i will not recomend this company !
0	please go to interflora !
0	much_better !
0	i experienced fast service with no_problems at all , the process for ordering prescription_drugs for my pet was made so easy .
0	i appreciated the communication via_email keeping up to date from receiving the order , it being_processed and dispatched - all of which was very quick !
0	i would readily recommend viovet to any pet_owner .
0	i have saved over half the cost of the monthly prescription and i will_continue to use viovet .
0	great service and super_fast delivery .
0	just follow the instructions they provide and it should work .
0	if for any reason you don_'_t want to restore the device ( like in my case ) and the provided instructions didn_'_t work , don_'_t panic , just do a little google_search and you will find many ways to achieve this .
0	after using a friends curling wand she recommended beautycow . com to purchase one , price was great , website was nice and simple , recieved my product the next_morning and couldnt be_happier with it !
0	will be purchasing more from beautycow in the future !
0	great vendor , fast service and excellent communication .
0	highly_recommend !!

0	i learned about a product from a close friend and i looked it up and say that you all had this item .
0	then i looked up the item other_places but your product was much_cheaper .
0	like by 00 . 00 cheaper !!!!!
0	saving money for me is always a plus !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	!
0	guys turned_up on time and did exactly as asked .
0	very kind and just got on with it .
0	my partner and some friends were at the other end and they were even quicker unloading .
0	took all the items to rooms specified .
0	no damage_caused at all .
0	would recommend using anyvan and would highly_recommend the guys that came to us .
0	quality product , fast delivery :) will be using them again , thank_you .
0	first bedframe was broken , so i refused delivery .
0	a replacement was due to come on monday by 0pm .
0	didnt arrive . called cust_services but they were busy so i was put through to sales , they took my details , said someone from cust_services would call back .
0	i called them 0 times that day , apparently they were too busy going through emails from the weekend .
0	said i wanted to cancel but i couldnt do that til i got through to customer_services anyway !
0	called again on tuesday_morning , still busy .
0	asked for delivery company and ref no .
0	so i could call them myself - delivery company informed me that the headboard was broken so they didnt send it out !
0	cust_services finally got back to me , just apologised , like that would make a difference - i still dont have a bed !
0	if bedman called the delivery company instead of trying to get through to cust_services , it would have saved alot of time and hassle !
0	if you dont have enough staff , employ more - its simple .
0	the cust should '_t have to lose out because someone cant do their job !
0	i '_ve now lost 0_days wages and still dont have a bed !
0	i was told that no compensation is offered for loss of earnings which is " clearly_stated in our terms & conditions !"
0	save_yourself the hassle , go with someone_else !!
0	i wish i did .
0	i found e_- careers very easy to use , and with being_able to complete the training and assessments at a time that is convenient for you it really is ideal .
0	there was always somebody to contact if you were unsure of anything and this was very reassuring .
0	an excellent course , with excellent staff for support .... what more could you need ?
0	after buying 0 faulty / problematic pre_- owned htc desires from the cash_generator website i looked online for an_alternative place to buy from .
0	after a brief look on google i came_across the refurb phone website and was pleased to find they did the same phone for a very reasonable_price but also with 0_months warrantee !
0	the phone arrived a couple of days_later imaculate and works a dream !
0	would certainly recommend !
0	fast delivery
0	low_prices
0	no problem with international_shipping
0	will definitely come_back :)
0	i had a problem signing in from my mac , and there was this very helpful lady in customer service that solved my problem in one second !
0	no wonder_why this company is great !
0	thank_you !
0	pleased with this order - the quality is great and the fragrance arrived really quickly .
0	the 00h free post is really handy , and better_than some of the other , similar_sites .
0	the whole service was great - really , really easy , i was very pleased with the amount of money i received for my phone and the bank_transfer was quick and completely_hassle_free .
0	i would definitely recommend anyone to use mazuma in future - i will !
0	thank_you .
0	we got the call to go and collect my ring .
0	when we got there ( it '_s a long drive ) we found that my ring had been made the complete wrong_size .
0	when they '_d taken the order originally they hadn_'_t written down the size and instead of phoning to ask they just guessed !
0	it was far too small !
0	i '_m a o and it was j .
0	they initially offered to resize it there and then which we were not happy about .
0	we '_d have lost quality making it so much bigger .
0	then they offered to give me the one from the shop floor , which everyone would have tried on .
0	i wasn_'_t happy so they did agree to make a new one and post it to me when it was ready , free of charge .
0	we had intended to order my fiance '_s ring that day too but after this experience we actually went to another jewellers who managed to make his ring on time and perfectly .
0	we were given his with a valuation certificate , photo etc .
0	mine from marlows just came in a box without even a cope of the receipt .
0	and mine was mich more_expensive .
0	really disappointed and has made what should have been a lovely experience that little_bit less special .
0	the ring is beautiful but i think everytime i look at it i '_ll feel that twang of disappointment .
0	i love using moonpig !
0	its great for every_occasion .
0	i have brought several cards from moonpig and they all look exsactly how i wanted them to , if not even better ... you can personalise_cards which gives them a personal_touch :-)
0	just great !!
0	!
0	great store !
0	love everything in the shop !
0	!
0	i recently brought a travel_system from mothercare instore .
0	i recieved a letter several months later saying that the car_seat_cover wasn_'_t safe and hadn_'_t been sprayed with fire resistant solution , they said they would send me a new cover which would be safe .
0	0_months later and i havent_recieved the seat_cover and i bearly got an opology .
0	clothes are great but i wouldn_'_t buy a travel_system from them again as this has put me off .
0	they are rubbish at getting back to you and never stick to there word .
0	toys are good but i find a lot of products in store are very over priced compared to other stores like toy ' r ' us ...
0	ebayer is a fabulous company and a great way to sell your old stuff , i use it all the time !
0	fabulous company , greats deals and offers flexable payment options !
0	very happy with all of my purchases :-)
0	i ordered a lara croft tomb raider costume from all fancy_dress after_searching all over the web for one , the price was very reasonable and on sale from £_00 . 00 to £_00 . 00 !!
0	i '_m not very good with computers so i phoned their order line and on the other end of the phone a very polite young_lady_who helped_me put my order through with ease !
0	i then received my costume just 0_days after with just the standard £ 0 . 00 post service !
0	the costume was great quality and everyone at my party loved it too !
0	thanks all fancy_dress , will_definately use you again in the future !
0	sold my phone and within 0_days of sending it off i had a my cheque through my door .
0	recommended
0	my partner waited in between 0 and 0 today as delivery was expected between 0 and 0 .
0	he had to go to work at 0 and guess_what ?
0	no delivery .
0	i came home from work at 0 to find a crumpled up card through the door with absolutely no information on at all , just a card ref .
0	called the customer service team , one guy was fairly helpful and gave_me a depot to collect from .
0	tried the depot to see if item was actually there and number was unrecognised .
0	called back , spoke to ' senior ' member saffron who was very rude and unhelpful and would not discuss anything with me even_though the other guy already had .
0	we have now had to reschedule delivery for 0_days time as we both work and that is the next_day we are in all because the company would not keep to their_word or speak to me even_though i have all the information required .
0	where is the parcel now ???
0	never use if you have a choice .
0	this is the second issue with them !
0	!
0	the service was quick and easy !
0	would definitely use again :)
0	also delivers to channel_islands in record_time !
0	my delivery was in 0 parts , all collected from the supplier on the same day for next_day delivery .
0	unfortunately only 0 parts of the delivery arrived .
0	the other part has_been lost for around a week now .
0	my experience was wholly unsatisfactory .
0	first of all , after receiving confirmation that i had paid in full which showed that i also requested for 0 additional drivers , when i arrived at the company – dollar rentacar - i was informed that i would have to pay for the two additional drivers as well as a full_tank of fuel as per their policy .
0	their excuse was that it is a risk when renting a car through a 0rd_party .
0	as it turns_out , i paid , with just one additional driver , i ended_up spending 000 usd over the price of other rental_car agency hence being cheated by rentalcars . com and dollar rent - a - car .
0	this is completely_unacceptable and an abuse of our trust to falsely and advertise prices that were not accurate and hence making customers drastically pay more of a service that would have been cheaper elsewhere .
0	in addition to this , when i was renting a vehicle , i asked to be quoted in usd and then after i entered all my details and pressed_submit , i was then informed that i would be charged in nok which is again unacceptable and was not made obvious during the check out process hence , whilst i was paying with a us credit_card , i was also charged the exchange_rate .
0	good laptop seller
0	i love it very much , good camera charger
0	i buy an apple laptop battery from world - batteries . co . uk , it is high_quality , i want to give all 0_stars
0	received the post wallet the next_day and received the cheque 0_days after i '_d posted it .
0	very impressed .
0	almost booked with one of hostelbookers rivals hostelworld , until i found out that hostelbookers was about 0 % cheaper .
0	the site is really easy to use .
0	thanks hostelworld !
0	from the first phone_call i new that we had chosen the right place to buy my engagement_ring .
0	nothing was too much_trouble , from changing the ring size at the last_minute to the phone_calls from the team ensuring me that my ring would be with me by our specified date .
0	the service and quality of your products is 0nd to none and we will_definately be back !

0	fast delivery and cheaper games than_anywhere_else fantasic ..........!
0	when i was ordered large items before , like - bed , matress and cooker and they was delivered by argos own van - delivery , was promt and fantastic , they call all times 0 hour before delivery , to let you know when they will arrive .
0	but when i ordered a dinning_table , what is small item - they use yodel , and yodel did ' nt arrive in time stated 0am - 0pm for next_day delivery , they didn_'_t arrive at all , they leave tracking_info , that item was out for delivery , but then returned to depot without explanation .
0	i call argos to find out what happening and they contacted yodel and yodel say , that item will be delivered tomorrow , but next_day , when i track , its says , that my dinning_table is returned back to argos , because i refuse delivery !!!
0	what ???
0	how can i refuse , if yodel newer showed up ?
0	argos say that only option for me is - to buy table again , yes wright , but they will return money only in 0_days and i don_'_t have extra 000_pounds - to buy again !
0	and table is in sale price , and when i get money back , table can be out of stock or sale can be ended .
0	great - now i '_m without money and without table .
0	thanks - yodel !!
0	!
0	argos is a good company , but layed down by rubish delivery companies , like yodell .
0	i have previously bad expierence with yodel , when buying from other shops , if i was knowing , that my table will be delivered by yodel , then i will never buy it !
0	becouse i was thinking , that it will be delivered by argos own delivery , what is great , but unfortunately , they deliver only bigger items by argos own delivery - that they say to me .
0	great website i '_m really impressed with it .
0	i have ordered from this company twice so far , all good !
0	products arrived very quickly and everything in order .
0	i like how they stock protein in smaller_sizes as well as the standard 0kg_bags .
0	the protein seems to be of a very high_quality too .
0	what a great company .
0	they have a very good range of products at reasonable_prices , and have friendly customer service , and what '_s more ....
0	they are reliable !
0	i know if i buy something from them it should arrive in the post the next_day .

0	i advise to all who got scamed like me to file for chargebeck .
0	i love ilumi , i '_ve ordered from them a few_times_now and they '_ve never got the order wrong once , everything has always tasted great and they occasionally do freebies too , amongst their other special_offers .
0	ilumi is actually saving us money as it feels_like having a takeaway but without the hefty price or hefty calories !
0	i '_m not allergic to gluten or anything but i do feel ' healthier ' when i '_ve been eating these meals .
0	there is a good selection of different meals to choose from and at the moment they are introducing various new types of cuisine .
0	0_stars from me !
0	bought a few items from this website , some were sent in wrong sizes , one item smelt of fish and others were poor quality so i sent the whole lot back for a refund .
0	they refunded me except for one item which they are accusing me of keeping !
0	i am trying to claim through paypal and will also be involving trading_standards .
0	quite obvious they are pulling a fast one to recoup their postage_costs !
0	transaction_id_:_0000000
0	i am still_waiting for my beyonce_tickets for munich in 00 days .
0	we booked our tickets in march , 0 month time to send them and we still dont have them .
0	i have to fly from england to germany and wont_be able to print out the tickets 0 hour before .
0	i really dont want to fly to germany for nothing .
0	so please send me my tickets !
0	all we do in the waiting time is thinking whether we will get our tickets and whether they will be invalid .
0	i will definitely never use viagogo again
0	i travel alot and often put my junk in storage for several months at a time .
0	compared with traditional self storage westore offered :
0	boxes to throw my stuff in
0	convenient pick - up
0	safe secure storage off - site
0	cheap too
0	no more worrying_about how to get to an industrial_estate to pick_up my things on returning to the uk .
0	westore return the things i need when i want them .
0	couldn_'_t recommend enough .
0	having traded in my old_mobile phone using their comparison table of recyclers , i '_m now using their search_facility ahead of any buying decision - i love how easy the site is to use and how it looks .
0	i bought a incrystal block for my parents_anniversary and was really pleased with the result , the delivery was super quick and end product very special .
0	i purchased a cross - hatch jacket , which looked very nice .
0	however , due to the time of year it was impractical as i was hoping it would be thicker - no fault of stand - out .
0	ordering was very easy , and customer service was great , i ordered the wrong_colour and quickly emailed to see if i could change this - it wasn_'_t a problem .
0	quick delivery and i got what i had ordered .
0	on realising that the item wasn_'_t suitable , i had to send back .
0	my only issue is the cost of returns .
0	it cost me nearly_£ 0 , to send it first_class recorded .
0	i didnt have to send it this way but for peace of mind , i think most people would send it recorded .
0	anyway , you do not get re -_imbursed for the return cost , so basically , i have lost £ 0 and got nothing to show for it .
0	which is a shame .
0	if i knew what i was wanting , and had physically seen the item , then i would have no - hesitation using the company again .
0	i decided to use collect_+ for the first time after trying to sell a few items to pay for expensive vets_bills .
0	i used the standard two day delivery service and it was not_overly clear to up the insurance value on the item ( my fault completely , assuming the claim was accepted )
0	i sent the parcel on 0st_july and the parcel was collected the next_day all smooth and clear , the parcel arrives at the national hub at 00 . 00 and that was the last transaction date .
0	i spend over an_hour on the phone to admin yesterday trying to track this lost parcel , how can a parcel get lost when it was packaged that no one would open it or see in it .
0	although i cannot see it it was taken to another depot the next_day at 0 . 00am , this doesn_'_t show up on my transaction details and only came to light this morning after numerous checking !!!
0	!
0	i thankfully have a very patient ebay buyer which i am going to have to refund and be out of pocket because one of collect +' s light fingered staff on night_shift .
0	sadly the packet was small and light_weight enough to make it obvious that it was a mobile phone .
0	what a complete_joke , i can claim and if i win i will get £_00 back which means a refund to the ebayer of £_000 , ebay fees of £ 0 , collect_plus fee of £ 0 total out of pocket and having to find = £_000
0	thank_you very much no i am even more out of pocket !
0	i will never use your service again , i have sent 000 '_s of parcels through royal_mail standard non signed for and all arrived perfectly !!
0	!
0	avoid like the plague and recent feed_back seems that this is happening more than it should !
0	very angry customer who is severely out of pocket now and struggling to find funds for vets !
0	!
0	thank_you for your fabulous service and customer_care , not !
0	i think you should be searching harder for this item !!!
0	!
0	my boyfriend and i were browsing for an engagement_ring and we found diamond dealers direct .
0	we had the pleasure of being seen by a lovely gentleman , oliver .
0	he sat down with us and asked all the right questions and was not pushy at all .
0	he brought out enough samples to give us plenty of options but without overwhelming us .
0	his knowledge of diamonds and rings was outstanding and he was very friendly and professional .
0	after trying on many shapes and sizes we settled on a 0 . 0crt sophia and i couldn_'_t be_happier and we were very surprised at how reasonable the prices were .
0	in fact we were so pleased with the all_round service and the options oliver gave_us , we even found and ordered the wedding_bands the same day .
0	i cannot wait to show them off .
0	thank_you very much for making this , what could have been a very stressful and expensive event an easy , effortless one .
0	thank_you diamond dealers direct and thank_you oliver .
0	product always available at amazing prices !
0	very surprised that the quality was so great considering the price and i am notoriously hard to please !
0	efficient , good customer service and quick responses if any_problems_occur .
0	i use this site at lease every two_weeks :_o_)
0	the clothes are shoddily made .
0	i bought a few things from there about 0_months_ago and everything has dropped to bits .
0	a dress that tore at the seam was sent back the next_day and i have only just received my refund , of which was £ 0 less_than what i paid for the dress as they took off the cost of delivery !
0	what a cheek since it took them 0_weeks to do the refund in the first place .
0	i sent an_email_saying i would go to trading_standards if they didn_'_t give me my refund and i would never use the site again and to add_insult to injury they replied apologising and offered me 00_%_off my next shop .
0	blind ?
0	no , stupid ?
0	probably not , terrible customer service ?
0	absolutely !
0	avoid like the plague !
0	i was very very pleased from gadget_panda .
0	i was a bit_worried_about sending my gadget of as i have never done anything like this before and they was brilliant they sent me a email when they recived the item and they kept me posted on what was happping .
0	the money was in my paypal after the second day of them receving the gadget .
0	they gave_me the same amount as what they said from the beginning with no emails trying to knock the prise down .
0	i would defiantly use gadget_panda again and would recomend to anyone .
0	thank_you very much gadget_panda a pleasure to deal with .
0	a ********
0	easy experience and trustworthy
0	such a great service from lisa harkness .
0	she came up with loads of choices for our chosen destination and took all of our requests into_consideration , going that extra_mile to make_sure we got everything we wanted , and there were no_grumbles when when we were constantly changing our_minds on the details ( and being a group of 0 , that was quite a lot !!).
0	i will_definately be using holidays_please ( and lisa in particular ) for all my holiday needs in the future .
0	i was soo tired travelef from poland to uk and there is no place to sleep
0	always use hotstel bookers for travelling
0	very quick and easy and cheap
0	thanks guys
0	my father linked me to this website after i expressed my distress about the difficulties of finding accommodation .
0	i loved the map_feature as well as having access to user reviews .
0	this website truly removed the stresses of booking my holiday accommodation !
0	i '_ve been using this company since last_year september .
0	i '_ve found them to be fast in delivering completed images and they do a very neat job .
0	however , recently there was a mistake in my completed image and i dismissed it and stated the reason .
0	i waited a few_days and then emailed the uk support_team to find out how many more days it would take to rectify the issue .
0	i did not get a response .
0	i have happened to just log_into my account at rtb ( to find an_alternative way to communicate with them ) and found out it has_been completed ... why didn_'_t i get a notification that it had finally been complete ?
0	why didn_'_t i get response to the email sent ?
0	it '_s a shame because i had nothing but praises for this company , but i feel now that my custom has_become somewhat a bother to these people , even_though i am paying for my pictures to be edited .
0	yes , sometimes i send pictures one at a time days apart , sorry if this is irritating to you rtb , but i design and create my different variations weeks - months apart , i am unable to send images in bulk .
0	i '_ll look for a similar company to do my images from now on , i don_'_t want to be a bother .
0	i got a message from my neighbour telling_me he has my parcel from amazon at his house .
0	i was surprised and confused for two reasons .
0	0 ) i did not receive any sort of card or note telling_me that my parcel has_been left with my neighbour .
0	0 ) though i was expecting many parcels during the week , i wasn_'_t expecting anything from amazon .
0	i come to find out that one of the companies i was expecting the parcel from , used amazon logistics to deliver .
0	i told my neighbour that i didn_'_t receive any card that my parcel was left with him .
0	my neighbour told me that he found my parcel sitting_outside my house in the rain .
0	he took it inside his house to look after it for me .
0	i was so angry about this , luckily my good neighbour got to it before a thief did .
0	my car , my neighbours bike and even my bin ( yes my bin can !)
0	has all been stolen from outside our property .
0	this parcel contained a gift for someone !
0	if it was stolen , there wouldn_'_t have been any proof that this parcel had been delivered .
0	i was so angry , i looked all over the box to find out which courier was responsible .
0	unsurprisingly there was no courier name or logo anywhere .
0	i think delivery driver thought they would be untraceable because of this .
0	so i called amazon & gave them the barcode number on the box .
0	i found out it was their own - amazon logistics .
0	i '_ve had bad_experiences with other delivery companies but none of them have ever left my parcel ( s ) outside out in the open .
0	i '_ll definitely avoid amazon logistics
0	i paid for an express service to send my package to the usa - delivery 0 - 0_days .
0	how about it never arrived till 0_days_later ... if i had put all my trust into dhl and never tracked the package online ... the package will never have been delivered .
0	this is because my package was held up in customs , they required further information and stated online someone will contact me ....
0	i received no contact whatsoever .
0	when i called dhl , they told me the description was not descriptive enough .
0	this was the fault of the dhl employee who processed my package .
0	i took the items to the service point un - wrapped and un - packaged .
0	the dhl employee held the items in his bare hand and saw them with his own eyes , his even asked me the description and i gave him a description .
0	i told him ' beaded gloves , accessories '....
0	the dhl employee typed on the waybill ' accessories '.
0	now the dhl claims_department has just contact me and told me i am not able to get a full or partial_refund as it was held up in customs and not with dhl .
0	well the reason_why it was held up in customs is because of you dhl !
0	your employee should know better and put in a more detailed_description .
0	i don_'_t work for dhl .
0	can you imagine the lady for claims said that i should of put down the material , size ect of the beads !!!
0	!
0	how am i meant to know that for goodness_sake ?
0	when i was at your service point the dhl employee did not ask me for these further details ... dhl is so wrong for that .
0	there is no such thing as the dhl money back guarantee ...
0	lies they will look for any excuse not to reimburse customers and they will not accept_responsibility .
0	from now on ...
0	i will stick to sending my products worldwide via post_office '_s international signed for ...
0	it '_s half the price of dhl anyway .
0	i will also tell the international businesses and customers i deal with not to send me back anything using dhl .
0	they keep you waiting till kingdom come , when the package ( s ) finally do arrive the packaging has_been destroyed .
0	every packaged i have had delivered by hermes has had damaged packaging .
0	they lie and claim they came when they have not , i always check the online tracking regularly .
0	apparently , the delivery people of these independent delivery companies ( hermes , yodel , dpd ect ) are paid every time they are sent out to deliver - whether or not the package was delivered !
0	so they lie a lot that they ' attempted to delivery ' just to get paid_extra .
0	they used to quietly slip those ' sorry we missed you ' ' delivery attempted ' cards through the letterbox and run away .
0	i guess customers started catching them , cause now i '_ve noticed they rarely leave those cards but instead they use their online tracking_system to tell customers they tried to deliver but no one was in .
0	you only ever receive those cards if they genuinely did try to deliver and no one was indoors to receive .
0	i am avoiding hermes from now on and any companies that choose to use them as their courier .
0	warning please do not use viator .
0	i used them to book 0 tickets to a thames river_cruise for my mothers_00th_birthday on the 00th of may to find that the company do not and have not run cruises on thursdays .
0	when speaking to them on the phone on the day , they blamed a communication breakdown , between them and the company , to which i was told they have never run cruises on thursdays in all the years they have used them , which is irrelevant if you are selling something , it is up to you to make_sure you actually have a product to sell .
0	the upset and hurt you have caused and also time and money taken off work and also to get to london , is something we will not get back .
0	this also happened to two other families on the same day , a family with a child for a half_term treat and a family of 0 from france .
0	you certainly gave her a birthday to remember , thanks !
0	if you have unfortunately booked anything with viator , please confirm with the company that actually run what ever you have booked , before you waste time and money going there .
0	i have demanded a full_refund , as i do not want to rebook , as if i had wanted to go on a different day i would have booked a different day !
0	i have been promised a full_refund , but will wait to see if this happens .
0	i have emailed and await a response from viator , but will be looking to reporting this further .
0	please_please do not use this company .
0	sally slack is one of the most caring and considerate lady , mother and photographer i '_ve ever met .
0	i '_ve had in total , 0 sessions with her with my beautiful son , newborn , 0st cake smash and his 0nd birthday where he had a chocolate piñata .
0	he aboustly loves_his photo taken but sally makes him so happy , she '_s not ' scary ' at all .

0	i ordered a set of cartridges for our work pc '_s arrived very quickly .. an overal brilliant service .. never had any_problems when placing an order or receiving goods .
0	i ordered an item over a week_ago and as i had not arrived yet i sent them an_email last night just to ask if the item had been dispatched yet .
0	today i got an_email_saying the item was discontinued and that my order had now been cancelled .
0	it took them a week to tell me the item was discontinued !!!
0	and only after i had contacted them about it …
0	i can ’_t help but think this is a scam to hold onto customer ’_s money for a while .
0	they say on the email it will take a few_days for the refund .
0	not happy at all !!
0	!
0	it '_s a great way to get_rid of dvd '_s and cd '_s that were sitting on my self but prices were a bit low .
0	prompt pick_up but it took quite a long time to receive the money .
0	speedy service and lush products !

0	transactions process quickly and you receive the confirmation_email within_seconds , it '_s a very efficient system .
0	i always buy my concert_tickets from double0tickets , always get great seats and the tickets always arrive quickly
0	where to begin with this site ?
0	i joined tombola when it first started , and i loved it !!!
0	of course i did - i was winning left right and centre for about 00 months .
0	i would play every night , and i would win a full house in the red room literally every night - not to mention endless line and 0 line wins .
0	then the wins slowed_down a little , i thought this was due to having an unlucky streak - and soon i was going to the deposit limit of £_000 every_single week with only an odd line win here and there .
0	i have always maxed , and still end up waiting on 0 number for literally every line 0 line , full house .
0	i stopped_playing for 0_months , as i realised that the hobby was becoming an addiction and i didn_'_t want to go down that route .
0	when i returned to the site after 0_months ... low and behold ... won the first game i played !
0	for weeks after that i was winning and again another successful few_months .
0	soon the £_000 a week limit was getting reached on a weekly_basis , and the repeat winners , was just not worth the cash .
0	i play maybe once every few_months and still see those same names !
0	no matter what day , time , - within_seconds of joining a room their name pops_up !
0	the cm '_s are rude , patronising and the way they allow the " groupies " to join in is what i can only describe as bullying .
0	when you are spending £_000 a week you are entitled to vent your frustration when for the 000th time that day you '_ve missed yet another house , yet another jp ...
0	the repeat winners situation on this site is the worst i have seen , and i have no idea how they are able to get away with it .
0	i once played 00 games of cinco in a row ( that '_s â £_000 ) and with only thirty nine players or less for most of that few hours i played i waited on 0 for about 00_% of the games , missed the 00k jp 0 times and saw 0 winners win approximately 0 + times each within that time frame - one of which won 0 games in a row .
0	tombola knows most of its loyal_customers feel this way , and they don_'_t care - the reason they don_'_t care is because for every one of us that leaves - they get 000 more to replace us with their ads and voucher_codes .
0	if you ask me the site has_become too_big for its boots and the quality of service has massively slipped .
0	my view is - what goes up must come_back down , and i certainly won_'_t be there to bring it back up .
0	make of this site as you will , but i write this review as a genuine bingo lover , and one who has no problem with losing when its fair .
0	heist is a con too !
0	never won sod all on it
0	if your lucky_enough to win ... dont withdraw , you wont win again for years !
0	tombola please dont insult me with your generic_response ...
0	your site is fixed and thats that !
0	having seen online mixed_reviews of jagerstore . co . uk i was a little_apprehensive_about going to them to buy my boots - but they were so well priced i decided to anyway .
0	i was very pleased that i did - they phoned me when they didn_'_t have my size in stock and asked if i wanted a different size ( i did ) and were very thorough with their emails about when the boots would be in stock .
0	i was very happy with their service and will be using them again .
0	lovely selection of glasses that are cheaper_than the high_street and effortlessly stylish to boot !
0	brilliant quick service :)
0	as a production assistant currently working in tv , but hoping to transition into script development , i found this course both relevant and insightful .
0	the course was well_structured and delivered in an informal and friendly atmosphere , making the seemingly intense day manageable .
0	the small class size gave an intimate learning environment , which allowed for safe space to openly discuss ideas , and opinions on the course_materials we reviewed .
0	i feel the information and understanding i ’ ve gained is absolutely invaluable .
0	not only am i now looking at screen plays and my own work with fresh eyes , i ’ ve come away with an up to date list of contacts to gain actual work in the industry , and a few contacts from my fellow course members .
0	i decided to enquire_about mazuma , after i accidentally caused a bleed in my phone due to dropping it .
0	i hadn_'_t owned my phone for very long and was gutted at what happened .
0	my phone was valued at £ 0 . 00 by mazuma in it '_s current condition .
0	and had it not been broken and still in working order would have only been valued at a mere £ 0 . 00 !
0	not recommended as devices are valued far too poorly , unless you are not really concerned at the amount offered for your phone , and would just at_least like to recieve ' something ' for it , however little .
0	i have used these_guys a few_times_now and each time i am blown_away !
0	products are awesome and deliver is fast .
0	will be using them again and again !
0	!
0	i would highly_recommend drinkstuff , the product i purchase was fantastic , along with the price and to top it all off the delivery was very fast .
0	so i am one happy customer .
0	will be using them again !
0	:)
0	i was very happy with the service from mazuma .
0	i intially went to envirophone and despite only having the hanset only a month brand_new they tried to claim it had some damage and cut their offer by half !
0	i was absoloutely appalled .
0	i requested it back and sent it off to mazuma instead .. they had it the next_day and i had the full payment in my account that day !
0	no_qualms , no questions :), just a good honest service .
0	i first used glasses_direct for a simple back up pair of glasses which lasted me a few_years , then got told i '_d be better off wearing my glasses more as contact_lenses don_'_t let in much oxygen to the eyes ( i '_m realllllllllllly blind !!!!)
0	that '_s when i decided to order a nice pair of glasses .
0	brilliant value for money , would cost me at_least £_000 for one pair after thinning lenses at my opticians .
0	can get two_pairs thinned for less_than that with glasses_direct :)
0	only ordering more now as the pair i wore to work got chucked across the playground and scratched :(... old lady glasses string should stop that happening this time .
0	have recommended to all glasses wearers i know !
0	having never used this site to order contact_lenses , i wasn_'_t sure if i would receive my order as quickly as it states , but i ordered on a thursday_evening with estimated delivery the following_monday - tuesday .
0	i actually received it on the saturday before then so was really pleasantly_surprised .
0	will definitely use this site again .
0	i was very pleased with service provided by mazuma_mobile . so quick money straight on my account very pleased .
0	i found that this website was totally awesome as it offer affordable price to find the hotel .
0	plus , it was so easy to find the hotel that has fully specific criteria that i wanted .
0	the map provided just make everything easy .
0	i can plan the trip by comparing the distance between the hotel and the landmark of the places that i wanted to visit .
0	seriously , it did help a lot !
0	i will use this website again to find the hotel of the place that i plan to visit to be honest .
0	i have used the other website to find the hotel but this one is the best i have ever found !
0	just by looking at the map , you can see the distance from the hotel to airport or train_station easily .
0	it also give the suggestion of the best place to visit together with the distance details and yeah !
0	it just like you can the world from this website .
0	i could say that this website is the eyes of the world indeed !
0	:_d
0	this is an excellent company , i '_ve bought a bag and shoes from them , both cheaper_than elsewhere and delivered within a day ; brilliant !
0	!
0	love love love all the products .
0	they really have worked miracles for me .
0	my skin is now healthy and pure .
0	the soaps do not really smell appealing but still nourish the skin beautifully .
0	to be honest i probably_won_'_t buy the soaps again unless they become more perfumed with essential_oils in future .
0	thank - you , thank - you , thank - you
0	" absolutely fantastic items and lovely service .
0	fast delivery .
0	thankyou .
0	my matress is very happy now !
0	;-)"
0	ordered phone on the 00th_june , money came out of my bank on the 00th , its now the 00th_june and the item has not even been dispatched .
0	part way through i wanted to cancel but they said they would make it a priority , they also said that as it hadn_'_t been posted or packed or even taken off the shelf , it would not cause further delay to me to change the colour of the phone to one that states 00 in stock , hoping this would help .
0	this appears not to be the case , the order status has started again from the beginning !
0	' your acceptance of our order has_been confirmed ' ??
0	yes and paid for weeks_ago !!
0	customer_services give you the same line about high_demand for product , logistics problem etc etc wish i '_d looked for reviews before purchasing - i recommend you never use this company
0	i '_d seen a pair of glasses i liked in a shop but i couldn_'_t find them online as i '_d searched many sites for them , it appeared they were the latest release .
0	designer_glasses boutique appeared to have the most_recent designs so i called their number , it was answered straight_away by emma who told me she would call the designer and try and obtain the glasses .
0	she soon rang me back to advise me they were available and had been added to the website and sent me the link .
0	i ordered the glasses and within good time they had arrived .
0	excellent friendly service , no_hassles , good price , will_definately use them next time and i have already_recommended to friends and family .
0	thank_you
0	i booked flights to travel to orlando with them as they were the cheapest around by about £_000 .
0	i booked on 00st_march_0000 .
0	i received a confirmation_email and all was fine until i got a call on 00th_march_0000 from a representative of the company to tell me that unfortunately when i booked my flights at 00pm on 00st_march_0000 , the price had changed at midnight ( 0 hour after i booked ) and as a result i would have to pay £_000 more .
0	i asked why i had to pay more as the price only changed an_hour after i had booked and paid and surely the price i paid had to be honoured .
0	at this point he was very aggressive and i had to ask him numerous_times to stop shouting at me .
0	at first i thought it was a hoax call , maybe somebody trying to get my to disclose my card_details over the phone as the guy didn_'_t even know the details of my booking .
0	he told me it was for 0 adults and 0 child , when it was in fact for 0 adults , 0 child and 0 infant .
0	he only knew the flight was to the usa and didn_'_t know the dates of travel .
0	i was on the phone for 00_minutes trying to understand what was going on as he was talking very fast and kept putting me on hold claiming that he was ' looking for a good deal for me '.
0	i told him in the end that i just wanted a refund as i was unhappy to deal with his company .
0	i also asked why it had took them a week since i had booked to contact me , to which he replied he had been off sick .
0	he told me that the money would be refunded to my card in 0 working_days .
0	that was 00th_march .
0	i emailed him directly on 0th_april and submitted a web enquiry form asking about my refund .
0	he completely_ignored my email and despite getting an_automated email_saying 00_percent of emails are responded to within 00_hours , i am still_awaiting a reply .
0	i rang again on 0th_april ( as it had been easter_bank_holiday in between ) as the money had still not been refunded .
0	he told me it would be in by 0th_april .
0	0th_april i rang again to be told another 0 working_days .
0	friday 00th_april i rang again to be told it would be today .
0	i looked up details to complain on the company website and it says that in emergencies to contact mr . ken or mr . sam and provides mobile numbers .
0	the first mobile number for mr . sam rang out and whoever answered told me i had the wrong number .
0	the second number for mr . ken was indeed him .
0	i explained my problem and he told me he would call me back - this was last friday 00th_april .
0	i am still_waiting for his call .
0	i am worried sick i will not get the money back as it has now been just short of a month and it is over_£ 0000 .
0	i can '_t book anymore flights until i get the money back and at this rate the flights are going to be that expensive that we won_'_t be able to go .
0	i ordered a bottle of lulu just before christmas and it arrived within a couple of days and was well_packaged .
0	would definitely recommend and use again .
0	booked in for a suitable day and time very easily .
0	the driver was running_late due to van issues so i was called to be to informed , however he still turned_up within the allotted_time - scale .
0	it was so much_quicker_than visiting a garage and i would definitely use again .
0	i had 0 or 0 quotes for roman_blinds for 0 windows .
0	the quote from hilarys was very similar to the other quotes we obtained from local companies so we decided to proceed with them for peace of mind with guarantees and quality etc .
0	the staff that came to the property to measure up , quote and then fit the blinds were very polite , knowledgeable and friendly .
0	i would definitely use them again .
0	i like that there is a variety of items to purchase at sima .
0	the prices tend to be lower_than other_places and i especially like the ' home ' section .
0	i have used magic_madhouse a couple of times_now and dispatch and delivery is always quick , and products are always top_notch !
0	the loyalty_scheme is also a brilliant bonus .
0	00 / 00 would use again : p
0	i had a little trouble with another retailer taking my money and then informing_me the items i had ordered were out of stock for 0 - 0_weeks , so i got a refund from them and happened_upon fitness superstore in my search for a replacement .
0	i initially emailed to inquire_about the stock_availability of a few items , and received a reply nice and quickly from a fella called chris .
0	the items i was interested in were all in stock , and for being a first time customer he gave_me £_00 off my order .
0	i called to make the order on saturday ( 0th ) afternoon and everything arrived nice and early this morning ( wednesday 00th ).
0	i got a call from the delivery driver 00_mins before delivery and he was very helpful in placing the pallet as close to my garage as possible .
0	i have just finished putting everything together and it is all perfect =]
0	the customer service i received was second to none , both through email and telephone .
0	i didn_'_t get to speak to the man who sorted everything out through email for me , but the guy_who took my order over the phone was very helpful and friendly .
0	i will be shopping here again =]
0	i got my phone valued on the monday got my envelope to post it on the tuesday which i did that afternoon got a confirmation e_mail on the wednesday and as i chose a bank_transfer got my money in my bank that day absolutely_brilliant service !!!

0	always buy my cosmetic products from here they are cheaper_than most_places and always have great customer service , never buy from anywhere_else for hair_care / makeup / perfumes or anything .
0	love it !
0	!
0	love this website to get all the best info on offers , always search here beofre selling my mobile as they show you the best price :) !
0	love these hair_extensions !
0	i bought a full set of clip in hair_extensions for £_00 and are really thick and full , i purchased through there site but i did ring them to confirm which colour would be right , i sent them a pic through an_email and they recommend a mixed colour to me , when i received them they matched_perfectly !
0	i have now had them for about three_months and are still going_strong !
0	love love love them !
0	wouldn_'_t be without them now !
0	!
0	i booked our_wedding_band ' the hijackers ' through warble entertainment , and the whole_process was so straightforward .
0	the website is modern , eyecatchy and easy to navigate , and find exactly the type of entertainment you require .
0	we found a few bands we liked and then sent an enquiry to warble to find out if they were available and get a quote .
0	within a day they '_d email me the info , and a booking form , and when i phoned up to make payment the call was answered quickly by a friendly bloke who didn_'_t sound like a monotone machine !
0	once the booking was done , i just had to sit and wait for the band to call me , which they did 0_weeks before the wedding .
0	they then discussed everything we ( and they ) needed to know about the day , and emailed me a copy of the set list they '_d be playing on the night .
0	it was all so easy , i thought at one point it was too good to be true !
0	but no , it really was all perfect , and the band were amazing !
0	i '_d definitely make warble my first stop now if i ever need to hire another band or any other sort of act .
0	i '_d recommend them to all my friends too ... infact , i already have told 0 of my friends who have future weddings the warble entertainment website address !
0	thanks so much for everything .

0	i had never even heard of jacinabox a month_ago .
0	i came_across it when i was searching for a bigjigs train set and was comparing_prices on many websites .
0	jacinabox was £_00 - 00 cheaper_than everywhere_else so i thought i '_d give it a go , although i was a bit_dubious ....
0	i needn_'_t have been !!....
0	i got an_email to confirm my order and another to say it '_d been dispatched , and the next_morning i received a text_message to say that my order would be delivered between 00 . 00 and 0 . 00 .
0	this wasn_'_t quite convenient for me , so all i had to do was reply to request delivery the day after .
0	the next_morning came and i received another text saying delivery would be between 0 . 00 and 0 . 00 .
0	it turned_up at 0 . 00 !!
0	absolutely fantastic !
0	i '_ve never known a company that gives you an_hour_timeslot ( its usually atleast a 0 - hour one !!
0	), and to also come during the quoted timeslot is almost_unheard of !!
0	the package was also wrapped well with lots of large ' air - bubble ' padding .
0	i liked the service so much i have since ordered 0 more things from jacinabox , which were just little things so they came via_royal_mail , but still just as good and quick , it just meant i didnt get the text_message or the timed delivery .
0	i '_d recommend this company to everyone .
0	i had an excellent experience in selling my first gen ipad .
0	i was paid in my account the full money as what i was estimated .
0	it took just 0_days for the credit to happen and their customer service promptly emailed me the status on once they received my post .
0	i ordered a dab_radio from them .
0	i got a confirmation_email , an_email on despatch and product arrived in perfect_condition as_described .
0	we had to leave spain in a hurry and steve made his bid , i asked him if he could collect asap so we could get a earlier_ferry , he left his home and come to us in a drop of a hat .
0	him and his dad turned_up and they were spot_on time , super friendly but still very professional .
0	we was going through a stressful time and a big move and these_guys made it a hell of a lot_easier , they had great communication_skills the whole way and i have just met them at the drop_off point in the uk , everything was just as it was when we packed it , they had taken great care of everything .
0	we are so grateful to these_guys .
0	would highly_recommend to anybody and would use them again with out a doubt .
0	0_star service 0_star guys .

0	lovely clothes and very good quality ..

0	hen_heaven was a great company to deal with when booking my friends hen_weekend , helpful and efficient !
0	the dirty_dancing experience was so much fun !
0	we are even performing the routine we learnt at her wedding !
0	kathryn the dance instructor was fab and friendly !
0	hotel was lovely and we all enjoyed the all you can eat breakfast to help cure our hangovers !
0	was fab would definately_reccomend again !
0	ordered some jasmine beckett griffith canvas_prints .
0	they were of beautiful quality and am sooo happy with my order .
0	i live in australia and hoped they wouldn_'_t take to long to get here from america , which they didn_'_t , fast post & great communication_regarding when they would be sent ...
0	overall very happy with my purchase and as i said earlier , will definitely be buying from zazzle again :_d one very happy customer here !
0	beautycow was recommended to me by a friend and i wasnt disappointed recently ordered the ghd_air chraper prices and fast delivery i would recommend this site to everyone
0	never_experienced_such bad service in my life !
0	my friend ordered a package on river_island for my birthday , i live in the us , they live in england .
0	this was scheduled to arrive the day of my birthday 00th_may .
0	no sign of it .
0	still no sign for the next 0_days , and then my friend rings up , they decide to then tell us we have to pay duty on the items ordered , apparently it '_s in the small_print ... why wasn_'_t it made clear so that the package wouldn_'_t be held up ?
0	no one informed us it was even held up .
0	when asked what would have happened had this not been paid we are informed that it would have just been sent back to the uk .
0	i think it is completely appauling that they didn_'_t tell us this !
0	why would they not make this clear and let us pay when we pay for delivery ???
0	how were we supposed to pay it if we simply weren_'_t told about the charge , and not told how to pay the charge .
0	this is a $_00 charge for tax too which i think it a bit much on top of delivery , especially since they are gifts .
0	i have not had this problem with any other packages i have recieved from england in the year i have been here .
0	they tell us on the phone if we supply an e_- mail address and telephone_number they will contact us shortly to tell us how to pay this charge ...
0	i get an e_- mail saying the request has_been acknowledged at 00am yesterday telling_me i should get an e_- mail in the next 00_hours ... well its 0pm now and still no e_- mail , and still no package .
0	i am stunned at how badly this has_been handled and i still_haven_'_t got my birthday_present .
0	it '_s hard enough being away from home on your birthday without the added hassle of trying to contact a company to get my package released with barely anyway to contact !
0	i have never been more stressed out by a company in my life .
0	i think it '_s ridiculous that we have to pay a $_00 charge in the first place , but am willing to pay it , yet they should make this clear at the point of purchace and they should give a clear way to pay it ... how are you supposed to pay a fee to get a package released if you are not told how and when to pay it ?
0	i would definitely recommend this shop to anyone .
0	gave_me a fair price for my phones , reviewed them straight_away and sent payment very fast .
0	no bad_points at all !
0	loved it !
0	:)
0	i was extremely happy with the service i received from_start to finish , from sending emails to talking on the phone with staff , everything was so efficient .
0	when the items were due to be delivered i had a phone_call the day before to confirm , and also on the day the delivery was due .
0	the guys who delivered the furniture were very professional and pleasant .
0	overall my experience with the furnituremarket has_been great and i would not_hesitate in recommending them and will definitely use them in future .
0	studio sent an_email_saying parcel dispatched , a hermes tracking_number and expect 0 - 0_days .
0	it is now 0_days_later absolutely nothing and to make it worse they conveniently cannot offer an explanation - you need to contact the sender who has to contact them in turn !!!!
0	shut them down very incompetent
0	its always a pleasure to deal with tracey and the crew at market harborough .
0	nothing is too much_trouble and they always seem to come up with a great deal on printing .
0	proofs get done and sent back for checking as and when promised .
0	thanks for all your help yet again .
0	ordered a part , spoke to helpful gentleman to make_sure i had the correct_part , ordered on line very simple .
0	part arrived when they said it would , got it fitted the next_day and all worked_fine .
0	great saving !!
0	thanks
0	i wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else for my diy eliquid supplies , there are other_places that do similar sounding products , but the quality just isn_'_t there , liberty_flights offer more than any of the other so called ' reputable ' sellers on the web , their delivery is second to none , eventheir most inexpensive shipping_costs are really good value with nothing taking more than a few_days to arrive , i think the longest i have had to wait was about 0_days and that was because i waited_until about 0pm to make my order ....
0	i really couldnt be_happier with the products that i have bought .
0	i have tried other so called ' reputable ' companies , but the depth of flavour and the prices just can '_t be_beaten at liberty_flights , and i ave found that i have to wait longer for my order and when i have received it they just didnt have the same quality ... my favourite flavour is strawberry and lime which i bought as a pre mixed eliquid first to try and now make it for myself .
0	i never would have tried miing my own liquids without the in depth tutorials on the site which have saved me even more money in the long run .
0	i haven_'_t smoked a ' real ' cigarette in over 00 months now and i will never look back .
0	liberty_flights offer a great , fair and economical service and it really does pay to use them over cheaper brands because the quality is second to none .
0	i recommend your products to all my friends who are looking for an_alternative to smoking_cigarettes and everyone who i have sent in your direction hasn_'_t looked back either ...
0	thank_you !
0	i had no_problems sorting_out the necessary customs paperwork , the instructions on the website were perfect and easy to follow and getting my parcel sent off was easy as anything ...
0	the ups collection guy was really friendly , helpful and cheerful and i couldnt_believe it when the parcl i posted on wednesday_morning in england , arrived in the post to massechusets on friday_morning !
0	unbelievable quick service and a really reasonable_price too :)
0	adzuna has the most convenient user - friendly design .
0	it helps to look for a job , see what is going on in the market , compares offers and salaries .
0	it also aggregates job offers from other resources so you can find all options in one place .
0	strongly_recommend !
0	thanks , i got everything i wanted , reasonable priced and within a few_days .
0	thank_you .
0	i do love ordering from their site as i have never_experienced any_issues what so ever !
0	so everything was great sending my stuff i ordered back as the sizes were completely wrong .
0	and then this saga with my refund started .
0	i still_haven_'_t received it and the customer service representative i '_m talking to keeps sending me to my bank as she is not available to deal with the matter as they are saying that my money is refunded .
0	so i went to my bank and they told me to go back to the online_retailer as the refund hasn_'_t been returned !
0	and now im emailing with boohoo and they are utterly_useless and making_excuses in refunding my money and giving me id numbers which my bank can '_t use .
0	hope this is a warning as sometimes it '_s better to spend more money in similar_sites like asos as they better in the end !
0	do not recommend !
0	i can not really fault boohoo in the slightest , the only only problem i found that their sizing can differ however for clothes so affordable you cant really complain .
0	if you have a problem they will sort it out for you as soon as possible and with no_fuss .
0	definitely shopping with boohoo more often and spreading the word .
0	well what can i say about shoetique .
0	the shop itself is lovely , the website is great and the staff are helpful , friendly and very co - operative .
0	i have ordered many_times fro this store and they have even specifially ordered shoes in that i wanted .
0	they are always helpful and kind and explain if something is amiss be it deliveries have gone wrong , shoes havnt arrived , stock has sold out quicker_than usual and they will get what you want out to you a . s . a . p .
0	it is nice to have a company that are friendly and willing to help you no matter what .
0	unlike a number of companies now - a - days .
0	i couldnt recommend a better shop , and they certainly know their stuff too .
0	and after_reading comments on here i will say some people need to get a life and stop being so pathetic and childish , find something better to do than critise a shop day and night .
0	and out of a gesture of good will you should never refuse a free pair of shoes .
0	most companies would have given you jack all and told you to sod_off .
0	grow up .
0	i '_ve_used play . com for years .
0	it '_s usually the first site i go to when i '_m after dvd '_s cd '_s and games .
0	it '_s usually always the cheapest .
0	i '_ve bought electricals and toys from them too and again no_problems and always been bargains against other_companys !
0	happy customer and will_continue to use in the future .
0	0_stars for jacinabox .
0	they use a courier service who e_- mail and text you to let you know the 0 hour delivery slot when they will deliver your parcel which is fab !
0	i found the prices to be very competitive and plenty of choice .
0	i have now finished buying all my daughters christmas_presents ( i know , i '_m a bit early !)
0	but i would not_hesitate to use this company again , in fact , i '_m going to bookmark them under my ' toy sites ' bookmark !
0	i have been ordering my contact_lenses from contactlenses . co . uk since a few_years and never had any trouble !
0	it literally takes couple of days for the parcels to arrive ( every time !).
0	highly_recommended !
0	you just gained another happy customer :)
0	setting_up the broadband was a nightmare !
0	the first order did not go through and none of the talktalk customer support representatives seemed to be bothered to contact me and let_me know .
0	so , i call them again after 0_weeks to check what '_s going on , my order is late .
0	the order ( for some unknown_reason ) was cancelled .
0	then , i put a new order through , the broadband supposed to be running within 0_weeks .
0	it didn_'_t .
0	again , i had to call them and figure_out what is going on .
0	the answer was : ' due to technical problem , your broadband will be activated within 0_weeks '.
0	i spent hours on the phone with them , i had to explain the same story all over and over again .
0	the managers didn_'_t call back , as promised etc .
0	in total , i had to wait over 0_months to get the broadband active !
0	i do not recommend talktalk to anyone .
0	it '_s been a very bad_experience .
0	the products i ordered ( large planter and stand ) were delivered quickly , well_packed and in excellent condition .
0	i use hostelbookers because it '_s much_easier and better laid_out than other hostel booking sites on the internet .
0	it '_s also great that you only have to pay 00_% of the cost at booking , rather_than all of it .
0	i also like the great offers that they have on hostels , always cutting the prices .
0	i use it every time i book a hostel !
0	all online and every piece of information is readily_available - i highly_recommend this company and always book through them !
0	i bought an item as a christmas_present from the white company online - they incidentally are great but yodel . com is atrocious !
0	i waited in for my delivery and stood at the window as the timeframe they gave_me had long since come and gone ...
0	i watched the van_pull up , a man get out and not even bother to get a parcel out .
0	he wrote something on a card and walked up to the door .
0	i was in plain sight of the man and so there is no excuse for him thinking no one was home ,.
0	he didn_'_t even knock / ring the doorbell !
0	he put the card through the letterbox and walked_away - i raced out the door and asked him why he was leaving without even knocking - he looked at me , shrugged and said he thought iw asn '_t in ... he then got in the van and drove_off again !
0	why exactly is this happening ?
0	i ended_up receiving my item ( which had been purchased at the end of november ) in early january - too late to give to my aunt who i had bought it for !
0	when i did finally get the package the state of it was an_absolute_disgrace !
0	the packaging was hanging open - the bubble_wrap was near non_existent with how much it had burst in transit and the delivery sheet that for some reason was left with the item showed about 00 different touch pioints where it had been back and forth without going anywhere_near my home address !!!!
0	on top of this they left it on the wrong day in the wrong place ( i hd left delivery instructions to leave it in the left hand garage ) where they left it in the left had side of the step by the door - in the rain - it ruined the packaging of the item even further !
0	this company is an_absolute shambles and someone really needs to shut it down as it gives other delivery companies a bad name !
0	yodel . com - take noe please !
0	i was looking for a product online and randomly_selected supplementwarehouse . com because the low price stood_out to me .
0	after finding all of the items that i needed in stock ( which took less_than 0 minutes because of their organized site navigation ) i was greeted with another surprise .
0	they were going to match the lowest_price from any other online store !
0	that '_s what you call quality service .
0	i used to shop at bodybuilding . com for all of my purchases , but from now on , you can always find me shopping on supplementwarehouse . com .
0	thank_you for a pleasant_experience !
0	we will meet again soon and when we do , i will be buff and get great discounts !
0	i '_m really pleased with my new piano_stool and was surprised to see that it arrived the very next_day .
0	i writing to tell you how delighted i am with my purchase of a ring , i expected good quality and thats what i got , it is really a very beautiful ring very well_packaged and excellent service .
0	i will_definately recommend you to all my friends and family .
0	i wish you all a very merry_christmas and a happy new year .
0	this is my first time to use supplementwarehouse . com , but already i am sold on them .
0	i have tried to use other_sites to get the things i need for my cleaning business and have had less then stellar experiences .
0	one company kept me waiting for 0_months , only to cancel my order .
0	needless to say , the prompt service i received from sw . com has me thrilled .
0	thank_you , sw . com , for making a believer out of me !
0	i ordered the kyocera printer for the office and it was delivered next_day after we placed an order .
0	the printer was cheaper_than on many other_websites .
0	i also looked at the prices of replacement toners and they have competitive_prices as well .
0	i would recommend printerland . co . uk to everybody that needs new printer
0	at the moment i currently live in melbourne_australia , im on a holiday working visa for 0 years .
0	i had recently run_out of my conceptive pill , and found they did not stock my brand here , it was awful i really didn_'_t want to switch brands as im so happy .
0	i had been searching for some one to supply me with my pills here but all failed .
0	so i decided to look on google uk and healthexpress came up i thought i would give it ago i had nothing to lose !
0	all i can say is they have been amazing i had a query about my package in the post as i live in a block of flats they responded to me within hours and gave_me a solution in case i wasn_'_t in .
0	the products are perfect and just what i ordered and best of all the service is fast .
0	they have take the stress away and i know i can reordered as and when i need .
0	if your worried don_'_t be , im so impressed !
0	ordered one cartridge and it had not arrived .
0	cannot get through on the phone .
0	nearly a week after i placed the order i get an_email to say it is out of stock and no dates as to when they will be delivering it .
0	currently listening to their terrible on hold music and american accents .
0	i cannot get through to them to cancel the order .
0	i run a small children '_s theatre club on a shoestring and i need the printer_ink .
0	i am_furious .
0	i wish i had read the reviews on here .
0	overall very impressed with the quality and speed of service , i '_d definitely shop from here again .
0	the prices are also excellent so i '_m very impressed .
0	they took my money but never delivered .
0	they have not replied to my emails and do not answer their phones !!

0	i love hostelbookers !
0	it makes trip planning really easy !

0	sent an important item by special delivery by 0pm on 00 / 00 , by 00 / 00 they still had not received it .
0	i phoned royal_mail and there excuse was poor apparently it was a problem with tracking but this was a lie as the customer confirmed they hadn_'_t received it .
0	i asked over the phone can i claim for this then - she asked why ??
0	why i said - because i sent on a special delivery by 0pm on 00 / 00 and they still_haven_'_t received by 00 / 00 - is it not obvious why i want to claim !?
0	they didn_'_t apologise once and i was told to go to the post_office to get a claim_form - isn_'_t it easier to claim online i said ?
0	rm prices are frankly ridiculous , i can send via courier which guarantee my delivery for next_day for the same price - what is the point in royal_mail anymore ?
0	their prices keep increasing but the service does not improve so why pay them for a sub_standard service when you can pay couriers for a much_better service and guaranteed reimbursement if lost of damaged during_transit .
0	i am hugely_disappointed once again with rm and will not use them again except for unimportant letters only .
0	i started_using wtg nearly a month_ago now and i am so happy with them !
0	i am gradually & continually loosing_weight , i lost_0lbs in my first week and was overjoyed !
0	they have various offers available which are great for a tight_budget like mine ( this is the reason i first tried them ).
0	the delivery is next_day so you can start straight_away - no excuses for not loosing those extra pounds .
0	the food is really good - believe me i have tried many diets to your door and these are one of the best for a reasonable_price .
0	i did diet_chef last_year which has great food / menu choice but it is pricey so i '_d choose wtg over them for that reason .
0	the shakes are fab , if you are able to use a blender and a few ice cubes you '_ll love them .
0	the soups are really nice , they taste fresh and it '_s something to warm you up on these gloomy afternoons , i really love the mushroom soup .
0	the evening meals are really good , you get a good amount and you ' re not left_feeling starved - they are proper meals .
0	sometimes i add a bit of veg to my evening_meal if i '_m feeling particularly hungry but you only need a bit , the meals are substantial .
0	the snack_bars are tasty ( especially choc and peanut ) and fill the gap so there '_s no excuses to be sneaking into the biscuit tin .
0	one last thing i must point out is wtg '_s customer_care - if you have any_problems with your order or have any_questions_regarding the plan just give them a call or an_email ( which can be found easily on their website ) and they '_ll respond asap , they ' re really friendly and helpful and i can '_t thank them enough , i think you ' re lovely wtg !
0	once again i am super happy with northern_parrots .
0	i love their range of toys and the website makes it so easy to find toys specifically designed to cater for your species of bird .
0	delivery options are really good - i ordered next_day before 00pm and sure as anything my parcel arrived on time the next_day !
0	products are fab - my cag loves her northern_parrots products - toys and treats ( also buy her pellet food from here too ) and i can buy knowing the products are safe for my bird ..... as some companies that supply parrot_toys do not specify if they are safe and the materials used .
0	a * northern_parrots - recommended !!

0	vgb has great prices .
0	i had pre_- ordered a game , which arrived a day late .
0	can put it down to royal_mail being slow though , as vgb sent the game on a thursday via 0st_class delivery .
0	if they posted on wednesdays when a game is out on a friday , they could make_sure people actually get their games on release day as royal_mail doesn_'_t guarantee that 0st_class arrives the next_day .
0	:-)
0	one of the best online shops around .
0	i '_ve been using them for quite some time now .
0	they ' re always happy to answer_questions .
0	the online trade in service they offer is great .
0	you can either get cash or account credit ( which is always more than the cash amount obviously ).
0	when you order a game , it '_s usually sent out quickly and you '_ll be playing it a couple days after .
0	i keep recommending gx to friends and will_continue to do so .

0	was helped today by samantha who dealt_with my problem quickly and professionally .
0	she is an_asset to the p0g team !
0	even_though the problem was completely my fault ( i booked a parcel in for collection on the wrong day , the deadline had passed and i needed same day collection ) - she sorted_out for me in a matter of seconds !
0	after initially enquiring_about the nextbase stanchion mounts , i received a very quick answer to my question , prompting me to continue with my purchase from this site .
0	i received constant email_updates_regarding the delivery until it arrived on time the next_day .
0	i was extremely impressed and happy with the after care service i received and will definitely use 0wm again for my next gadget or tech purchases !
0	a very trustworthy and competitive company .
0	thanks to everyone who helped !
0	when i ordered i was bit_nervous whether it will b delay or do i get it , but it was arrived on time and i was quite surprised . so i would take this as a chance to thanks to barrington_sports for their excellent customer service and i will always be a good customer for you guys .
0	cheers ,
0	mahesh
0	i accidentally booked the collection from the wrong_address - i thought it would be a pain to cancel and re - book this , although i went on tot he live_chat and [_name_] helped straight_away - 0 minutes and she had changed the address and sent new documentation through - thanks a lot !

0	they have different currency options and the best filtering system out of the hotel / hostel internet sites .
0	it was easy to use and they have helpful information about each place .
0	with hostelbookers , it was easy for me to compare places to determine the best place to stay .
0	booking took 0 minutes and was very simple .
0	the first time i used hostelbookers , i messaged the hostel i booked to confirm that it went through , and they had my information right away .
0	i have never had a problem with them , and i haven_'_t had a problem with any of the hostels , either .
0	on wednesday i paid for a courier to collect my parcel on the thursday .
0	the money was immediately taken from my account but no - one turned_up .
0	on friday i contacted via web chat and was told it would be ' escalated ' and someone would get back to me .
0	no response , so i messaged again on saturday was told it could take 00 - 00hours to get a response .
0	i waited 00hours and on sunday again messaged again - i was told it would be ' escalated '.
0	by monday_morning i was very annoyed and again queried_why my parcel had not been collected and why no - one had actually bothered to respond to my query - and was told it would be escalated !
0	if it wasn_'_t so annoying the poor customer_care would actually be funny .
0	what use is a courier company that does not collect parcels ?!
0	and how can i trust it to actually deliver ?!
0	nope
0	bought as gift so did not use game myself , but it arrived quickly , well_packaged and the game was in original shrink wrapping - as was bought new .
0	all looks good :-)
0	great price on 0 bottles and delivered 0_days_later .
0	updates_via_text and email to let_me know when to expect delivery .
0	excellent service .
0	when ryan_air cancelled my flight !
0	i then had to change my car_parking arrangements .
0	just sent a quick email and within a couple of hours i had my new parking confirmation - got an extra 00hours at no extra_cost and no booking_fees !
0	:-) booking was straight_forward and cheapest price around for my stay .
0	website was easy to use and to register with .
0	i made use of the sale and treat_myself to some gorgeous fit_flops .
0	i am really please because it '_s very hard to find these shoes in size , colour , style i want anyway , never mind discounted !
0	:-)
0	although postage was delayed because of the bank_holiday_weekend ( i ordered on saturday and still had them by tuesday !)
0	very pleased , will shop with again .
0	i was drawn to the glasses_direct website by their 0 - 0 - 0 offer , and free tinting !
0	so thought i '_d indulge in some prescription_sunglasses ...
0	i found it hard to decide on style from the pictures online , as glasses always look different when you put them on .
0	then i discovered their free home_trial service !
0	i chose my fave 0 pairs and they arrived within a few_days , free of charge !
0	i tried them on , choose the ones i wanted , went back online and ordered straight_away !
0	so quick , so easy and so convenient !
0	:-)
0	website is easy to navigate , had some excellent offers on large bags of dog_food and has a good selection of products .
0	order and payment process is quick and easy .
0	delivery from dispatch took 0 workings days so would probably order in plenty of time as i was a little close to the end of the current bag of dog_food when i ordered but we made it , came by fed_ex courier .
0	items all arrived in excellent condition and much to my cats delight there were a couple of bags of treats thrown in as an extra on top of our order .
0	this site is not as well_known as some of the others i have used for ordering my animal products online but i can thoroughly_recommend them and shall be happy to use them in the future , it is likely that i shall use them for both cat and dog_food and treats if purchasing to keep delivery costs down .
0	this is the 0th of 0th time i have used medic_animal , we need a lot of items with a multitude of pets here :) medic_animal allows me to use quality products on my pets without paying the inflated prices at the vets .
0	i ordered 0 items and paid through paypal .
0	i had a quick response from the company to explain that they no_longer had 0 of the items and that i had only been charged for one ( which i obviously checked and was right enough ).
0	fast postage and item was well_packaged .
0	highly_recommended !
0	!
0	i have used mp for over 0 years_now and have always found the service from_start to finish fantastic , however this year it has_been horrendous , my last order i paid_extra for next_day courier ( ordered on a thursday at 00am well within the same day dispatch period ) i received a mail that afternoon to say it had been dispatched , friday came with no sign off it , contacted mp they couldn_'_t give me a tracking_reference for it , eventually got the tracking_reference on the monday and it ended_up that they didnt give it to the courier until friday_afternoon .
0	the items arrived on monday_afternoon and after a few mails i got them to refund the extra payment for next_day delivery as they had not delivered .
0	its such a shame as the products are fantastic but your only as good as the service you provide and this area is definately lacking recently .
0	i wouldnt be so quick to blame the courier , mp are marking items as dispatched without actually dispatching them by the looks of things , please sort it out !
0	fantastic service and excellent products reccomended by my nutritionist .
0	easy to manouvre website , superfast delivery and full contact details on the received invoice .
0	trustworthy professional company .
0	easy to go back and forth in between hostel pages , ( unlike hostelworld . com where i have to refresh my search everytime !)
0	love the reviews section as other_peoples opinions count towards the hostel i book .
0	having street view on the map page is seriously important too , especially booking in the amalfi coast i wanted a place that had a view of the water .
0	being_able to search for hotels / b_& bs as well as hostels makes my search time much_quicker and easier .
0	being a travelling couple it is often cheaper to get a b_& b private_room rather_than a hostel so thanks for giving us that search option !
0	only_thing that makes it a little hard is having to print out our confirmation to show the hostel ... as access to a printer while travelling is kinda difficult .
0	very please with jacket i received for my son and he lives it too .
0	delivery was very prompt .
0	thank_you .
0	excellent value for money and always up on the latest_trends .
0	my parcel was collected on 00 february .
0	that was the last time there was any recollection of my parcel .
0	it was not delivered or tracked and myhermes will not get police involved .
0	are they all in it together steeling goods .
0	stayed in villa tomeu in porto pollenca majorca for the third time , such a lovely villa in a perfect quiet spot close to all amenities and beach and now with added wi_-_fi what more could we ask for !!
0	already booked again for next year and can '_t wait to go back !!
0	!
0	a fabulous place to shop for all your special or unique drinks that you cannot buy in high_street shops !!!
0	!
0	i have used carterandbond before and have always had quick reliable service , my recent order was delivered the next_day and as always was great quality .
0	i had some real frustrations with the website , but all was resolved with daniel '_s solutions and efficiecy !
0	thank_you very much - good customer responsiveness goes a long way .

0	i have been ordering from muscle_finesse for years , every since i got into weight training 0 years_ago .
0	they have consistently offered the best prices , combined with fast ( and free !)
0	delivery , where i always receive my order the next working day .
0	their partnership with dpd is also great , so its easy to track my delivery , and make_changes to the date if needed .
0	mf often have fantastic offers , particularly on usn which is my preferred brand .
0	they send great emails with great offers , and i consistently receive 00_%_off or more , which makes their prices even cheaper .
0	mf are always my first_port of call for products , whether its my regular buys or a new product .
0	i always recommend them to anyone who buys sports_nutrition and supplementation .
0	a one of a kind website with really reasonable_prices .
0	a real wide_range of products with different choices of styles and colours .
0	i '_ll definitely be shopping here again for sure , however one of my nail_varnish products did come in the wrong shade ..
0	happy happy happy
0	:))))))))))))))))))
0	booked a hen_weekend in newcastle with chilisauce .
0	they catered to our needs to make_sure that we were given the best service and activities for a good night out .
0	the girls and i had such a blast with some good memories .
0	thanks for a fun and eventful weekend !
0	:)
0	i have had many many issues with my previous host and received very cold customer service in the past , but my experience with lcn and their service puts them above all hosts i have used over the years .
0	i am so happy to be using their services and to be a part of their customer circles , as their service is clear and friendly , their staff go out of their way to give all of the help they possibly can and more and they do it all with out treating you like a simply bank_account and customer number .
0	warm welcoming service every phone_call and very patient staff who know what they are doing !
0	they have a clear and easy to use service and for great prices for what you get especially with the 00hr help on hand too !
0	they have really taken all of my woes and headaches with my website away completely !
0	i highly_recommend them to any thinking to move hosts and want a friendly coherent service with great customer service and tech - support !
0	i '_ve traveled extensively using hostelbookers and have never yet had a bad_experience with them .
0	the website is easy to use and regularly offers cheaper prices than competitors hostels . com and hostelworld .
0	moreover , hostelbookers almost always has more hostels to suggest for any given city .
0	and because more people use this website , the ratings are always a lot more trustworthy .
0	think about it - the more people that rate a hostel , the more inclusive and accurate the rating will be .
0	so to sum hostelbookers up : easy to navigate , easy to read , completely trustworthy , and ahead of the competition in every way .
0	definitely use this website !
0	you can '_t beat it .
0	i was a bit_skeptical of the " design today , wear tomorrow " slogan that streetshirts advertises with , but much to my surprise , it was totally true .
0	the site was easily designed - and very prettily as well , if i do say so - so that i was able to make my design and submit the order all within one day .
0	and sure enough , the next_day , my shirt was at my doorstep , ready for wear .
0	fast service , easily_navigable site , and reasonable_prices !
0	couldn_'_t have asked for a better experience , as far as i '_m concerned .
0	my iphone was unlocked in the time_span it was announced and now i can fully go on with my day !
0	this was way worth the purchase !
0	thank_you !!
0	!
0	information is concise but very complete ! the site is convenient to use !
0	!
0	online learning works for me , i was able to fit my studies in around jobs at home and looking after our son .
0	the course was detailed and well written , i took notes along the way and made sure i learned something as well as doing the assessment at the end .
0	telephone support was helpful , as was the messaging .
0	i will definitely do another course with yourselves and would be quite happy to recommend trust_pilot to others .
0	awfull is to good for this company been with for a little while was ok at very start then went from bad to worse last time my broadband went down took me a whole day of ringing this number and that number as kept getting through to the wrong person apparently untill i told them that that months bill was not getting paid guess_what they could help me then amazing never again rather go with out home phone / broadband then go near these again
0	it '_s like hotels . com but for backpackers !
0	it has every city that i want to travel to so i don_'_t have to search around for a different site .
0	i do wish i could have paid the total for my hostel online instead of paying cash when i arrive , but i '_m assuming that '_s something to take up with the hostel itself .
0	i love cheapsmells , they always offer fantastic service , products arrive promptly and always cheaper_than other stores
0	i love this site , always a brilliant range of products which are usually cheaper_than on the high_street .
0	delivery is always super speedy - even without the next_day delivery !.
0	ordered my groceries late friday , found a delivery availablefor saturday at 0 pm .
0	driver came 0 mins late and apologised for the delay due to traffic , tesco send me a text_advising me about that .
0	few items were not available and on 0 item i was offered a substitute , the driver advised me about that .
0	he checked my eggs with me , allowing me to know that is they were broken i would have had a full_refund .
0	i had 0 bottle of water broken , he noted that and told me i '_ll have it refunded .
0	the driver was polite , gentle and carried my 0 crates into the kitcken , helping_me unload my bags .
0	as a first buyer i used a 00 pound online discount_voucher , so im super happy .
0	i ve ordered frozen_food , as well as fridge food and vegetables .
0	all was as if i just purchased it from store myself , with the only difference that i dont need to kill myself carrying all the bags :))
0	providing a great service along with awesome features is one thing but having the right people to support you throughout the way is something that i particularly look for when i seek to use services from a service provider .
0	soho00 ticks both boxes and has given us a peace of mind for the past 0 . 0 years since we started_using them .
0	ordered from very easy to use website and product arrived 0_days_later !
0	very happy with the price and the quick service !
0	!
0	was recommended to me by a friend and i was definitely not disappointed (: great service and really fast response .
0	i asked if they could refund me a paypal echeque payment and they got back to me within 00_minutes so i could sort_out an_alternative quickly .
0	really happy and great job , would definitely recommend ,
0	easy to use , no booking_fee .
0	great site !
0	have used before and will definitely be using again .
0	i get all my supplements from supplement_warehouse .
0	i pay half what i would at gnc ( even with shipping ) and you can pick a bunch of free_samples and other free things with your order , so that '_s always fun .
0	i can get vitamins super cheap and then it comes in just a couple of days .
0	i '_ve even tried to compare competitors prices ( to get the lower price ) and i have yet to find anyone who sells their products cheaper_than supplement_warehouse .
0	i tell everyone i know that they should order from them .
0	with a camping holiday fast_approaching i have been ordering various items from online stores .
0	i had ordered a suncamp electric hookup from another store and it arrived badly_damaged and so i called to complain to get nothing but a very unhelpful and rude conversation amounting to nothing more than " there '_s nothing we can do for you "!
0	this is a battle i '_m still fighting !
0	!
0	i had submitted an order to taunton_leisure the previous day for an outwell coolbox and thought that i '_d try my luck to see if i could get another hookup delivered before i go and so submitted an order with taunton_leisure online .
0	after_placing the order i saw on their wonderful website that i could call to discuss an order .
0	i rang and spoke to an extreemely polite and helpful man ( called darryl ?)
0	and explained my predicament .
0	he advised that he would call me back after looking in to my situation .
0	within minutes the phone rang and i was advised that my coolbox had been retrieved from the orders waiting for dispatch and that he would now package my electric hookup with the coolbox and send them both on next_day delivery for no extra_charge !!
0	the items have arrived this morning as promised and are well_packaged and in perfect_condition ready for my holiday tomorrow !
0	thank_you so much for your amazing customer service - i won_'_t be going to any other store from now on !
0	!
0	since i was 0 when i was diagnosed with chronic eczema i have found it hard to find products that don_'_t cause embarrassing rashes all over my neck .
0	i have tried so many cleansers boasting to be all natural that i have then had a reaction .
0	cleanse and polish is truly exceptional
0	i had no_problems with this they were very fast and every thing was great
0	i would like to say my experience with personal_injury assist has_been excellent they have kept me updated with claim , i would like to say thank_you to everyone at personal_injury assist and would recommend to anyone to go with these_guys they really know what they are doing , naheed kazmi
0	i made a booking today with bravofly .
0	there was a website error and i had to re - book the flight and unfortunately resulted_in a wrong date .
0	when i contacted customer service 0 minutes later , they took no responsibility at all for their error , and informed me that there was no option to cancel the flight and straightaway demanded extra to change the flight date .
0	i reluctantly accepted what they said and asked them how much was the extra fee to do this .
0	they said they would come_back , but then emailed saying they made attempts to call me which is totally_untrue .
0	there were no missed calls on my line .
0	they gave this as a reason as to why they cannot proceed to re - arrange the dates .
0	i called them again for assistance and clarification but they could not give me any news from the airline ; and it seems apparent that they have not even forwarded my request for a date change .
0	i offered to contact the airline direct with the date change but they refused to let_me do this .
0	the whole affair looks very suspicious to me , as every day they delay changing my dates means a higher price on my ticket !
0	!
0	to add_insult to the injury it may mean additional_costs for technical_error , through no fault of my own , as i can see other customers have been charged extra costs , and i will check my account to make_sure they do not do this .
0	if zero_stars were possible , i would have given this !!
0	!
0	unhappy customer
0	very easy booking process and very efficient when you arrive !
0	great price , no_complaints , quick easy and helpful
0	ordered a ds_game for my son on the day of it '_s release in the afternoon and received it in the post the following_morning , much to his delight and the cheapest price too .
0	have used this site twice and wouldn_'_t_hesitate to use again .
0	good prices and easy to print postage_label , took to the post_office and had an e_- mail acknowledging_receipt the next_day .
0	payment direct to my bank the day after , and best of all cleared some clutter .
0	can '_t recommend highly_enough .
0	easy to use and very informative , fast confirmation too .
0	ordered late_sunday_night and my order arrived mid_afternoon on tuesday , which considering i chose free delivery , is very efficient !
0	will definitely recommend to others in my club !
0	this is my first display_case i have ordered and was lucky_enough to do another search on the net whilst nearly checking out on another site .
0	good job i done another search and came_across this site as this display_case is clean cut and smooth and nicely finished .
0	the price was better_than i had seen_elsewhere too .
0	will be ordering another soon for next project but a custom job .
0	pete m
0	hampshire .
0	we got the new_york pass for our first trip to the city .
0	it was really useful because it was paid for before we took the trip so it was nice not to have to think of admission prices on arrival .
0	it got us into all the big attractions and even worked out cheaper_than paying as you go .
0	the book that came with the pass was also so helpful for discounts and information on all of the attractions .
0	the queue jumping was also a big bonus !
0	saved us lots of time waiting !
0	great little pass !
0	absolutely great service & such friendly staff .
0	amazing value for your money & everything arrived the way i '_d sent it .
0	might have to move away after uni just to use this service haha .
0	hats_off to you guys , great job .
0	i '_ve_used hostelbookers for the past 0 years and have not once had a problem .
0	i '_ve travelled throughout europe , africa , usa and hostelbookers was always my choice of booking company .
0	hostelbookers prices are generally cheaper_than the other_companies and there are no_hidden_fees etc .
0	i will_continue to use hostelbookers until i get too old for hostels .
0	very efficient service !!
0	would recommend and definitely use again !
0	really impressed with the quality of the goods i purchased and the 00yr guarantee
0	i posted a review on review centre which the company i reviewed requested be removed .
0	review centre contacted me and asked me to provide my name and address to prove i was a customer which i did straight_away .
0	the next_day they contacted me again requesting further information ( which i don_'_t know why they didn_'_t ask at the same time as their previous email ).
0	i couldn_'_t provide concrete evidence as most of the conduct with the company was over the telephone so i provided my telephone records to show how much contact i had had to have with the company in question .
0	it is now 00_hours_later and despite chasing them advising i had been threatened with legal_action by the company in question , they have still not responded and my review is still not on the website .
0	whilst i understand that review centre do have to verify your custom , i unsure why they feel they have to go to these lengths to investigate especially when a review is not illegal and i have checked with my lawyer to make_sure the content is fair and reasonable .
0	i had all windows replaced earlier this year and everything was fine .
0	the installation people were very friendly and accommodating .
0	recently , two windows in separate rooms failed to work so i called supaglazing to arrange an_appointment .
0	two engineers visited on two_separate_occasions and diagnosed different issues however , the issue was not resolved until the third visit .
0	i waited in on one occasion for an engineer who failed to turn_up .
0	i called the office the following_day to advise them of this and spoke to a gentleman_who was adamant he had called my land line to advise that the engineer couldn_'_t attend .
0	when i said i hadn_'_t had a call from him , his tone changed and he became what i can only describe as aggressive accusing me of calling him a liar .
0	he raised his voice and eventually hung_up leaving me completely dismayed that a client could be spoken to in such a way .
0	telephoned the office daily requesting an_apology which i am still_waiting for after 0_days .
0	no one has called me back .
0	windows are average , customer service is terrible so avoid if you want a good all_round service .
0	i ordered for next_day delivery , quick and easy to use service .
0	no_hidden_fees .
0	great communication all the way through from order to delivery .
0	would recommend .
0	mazuma were to be frank , absolutely_brilliant .
0	within 0_days of the initial sale online i had my money in my account .
0	i had no_problems at all with them , i was sent a postage pack the next_day , i posted my phone and 0_days_later i was sent the cash straight_into my bank_account .
0	mazuma offered me the most money for my old phone , a blackberry_0000 .
0	everywhere_else ( pawn shops etc ) were only offering my £_00 .
0	i would definitely recommend this service to anyone_wanting to sell an old phone .
0	unless it is in perfect_condition where ebay is an option , mazuma is brilliant .
0	always very quick and effecient service , if the restaurant ever gives me any_problems hungryhouse have refunded me or in the case of one of the delivery men who was harassing me and calling me on the number i provided hungryhouse took them down off of the site and spoke to the manager to prevent the delivery man from calling me further .
0	they really do go beyond being just a place to order food , they really value their customers
0	i sent in an old phone to mazuma and it was quoted at £ 0 because it was very old but i wanted it to be recycled and put towards a good cause rather_than me throwing it in the bin .
0	i requested the freepost_bag and 0 or 0_days_later it arrived swiftly in the post and i packaged the phone safely along with its paperwork and sent it back to mazuma .
0	two_days_later i received confirmation that the phone had been processed and received .
0	very fast and effecient service and i am very pleased with how effectively the whole setup worked .
0	will definitely be using again in the future .
0	beauty_bay were exceptional with their quick service and i was also greeted with a quick delivery .
0	the product i bought came all in_tact and the cherry on top was that it was on offer .
0	would definitly recommend and myself will order again ( i have a huge wishlist on their newly wishlist gadget online ).
0	i ordered 0 bouquets to give out to the mothers on my wedding day .
0	they weren_'_t the cheapest but i liked the fact they could be delivered to the venue without me having to physically go into a florist the morning of the wedding .
0	i was shown the flowers before the wedding meal and i was extremely disappointed - not only did they already look half_dead there was barely any flowers actually in the bouquet - definitely not as many as was advertised on the website .
0	i made the decision not to insult my parent / mother in law and told the venue to discard the flowers ( they really were quite pathetic looking ).
0	i then sent one of my guests out to buy a nice bunch at the local_supermarket - cost half the price , were still_alive and had a decent_amount of flowers in it .
0	i did contact serenata_flowers and they asked for images which i couldn_'_t provide ( they basically got hidden_behind a curtain out of embarrassment and i definitely didn_'_t want to insult our parents by handing out such a crappy bunch of flowers and i didn_'_t want to take them home with me either .
0	they did turn_up when they are supposed to though - despite using the worst delivery company known to man ( yodel ).
0	really bad_experience - would not recommend or use again .
0	easy to use website , great discounted items .
0	my new lush wetsuit arrived super quick the next_day :) thank_you very much i will definitely recommend you to my friends and use you again in the future !
0	!
0	great value for money and free next_day delivery - superb !
0	however , payment is via_paypal , would have preferred other methods of payment .
0	i have ordered lots of times from this shop .
0	i think they offer great value for money , next_day delivery .
0	i love their swarovski stones they have so much variety in stock which always makes a difference when you want to make something straight_away .
0	for christmas i ordered lots of kits and everyone was delighted with the finished articles , they offer good quality at affordable_prices just wish they were local so i could go in and pick more things that i havent spotted on the website .... probably best not on the doorstep as would be declared bankrupt in a matter of weeks :) love this place
0	good clear website .
0	great to see clothes on catwalk .
0	dor the price of the clothes the quality is fine .
0	sizes are true to life also .
0	i usually order in bulk and send some back if i order say 0 sizes .
0	free_returns and quick refund given to card .
0	good customer setvice
0	recommend .
0	great company .
0	always get goods quickly if in stock ( if not in stock clearly says so )
0	even traders within ebay very good .
0	great prices and returns_policy .
0	only problem is its very easy to buy your items in basket with 0 click ordering , even if you were just trying to browse .
0	but overall brilliant .
0	note : buy from big sites like amazon etc and check trust_pilot beware of fake sites .
0	odered goods mid dec_0000 have received no reply after one email_stating goods would be a few_days before they came back in stock .
0	doubt i will get a refund of them , hope visa can help .
0	wish i had read up on this website !
0	will be reporting them .
0	great products fantastic prices fast delivery always recommend fragrance_direct !
0	!
0	i got a dispatch email after what seemed like moments after i had placed my order , and the order arrived the next_day in perfect_condition .
0	i highly_recommend this website and their wide_range of products because of their excellent delivery times .
0	i have used interparcel on many occasions and i find their service to be very reliable .
0	i have seen some bad_reviews on this site and i cant_believe they are talking_about the same company .
0	on one occasion i used interparcel to send a pallet to one of our very respected clients and i needed it there as soon as possible and interparcel arranged a next_day collection as requested and it was delivered the very next_day also as requested and our client commented on what a fast and reliable service it was .
0	i have always been happy with interparcel and will_continue to use their services .
0	very simple to use and follow step by step instructions that are shown on the screen at all times
0	emma was so helpful got me sorted in minutes , thanks x
0	i have used hello_canvas twice before and i have been most impressed with not only the products but also the excellent customer_services .
0	would highly_recommend .
0	if i had the option to leave no stars i would .
0	this has to be the worst company which i have ever dealt_with , the staff appeared to be incompetent and unwilling to help .
0	i ordered glasses on 00 / 00 / 00 and was only notified on 00 / 00 / 00 that the frames were out of stock despite having spoke to one of their employee '_s in the mean time .
0	each time i attempted to get an answer as to when i would receive my glasses i was given the run around and was told that everything was ' unfortunate '.
0	eventually i decided to cancel my order and i have never came_across a company who is so willing to cancel an order without_any attempt not to lose custom .
0	i didn_'_t even get so much as a apology for the inconvenience which they had caused .
0	in honest it seemed like they had taken an order for goods which they could not fulfil and just wanted to take people ’_s money for something which they could not supply .
0	i specifically ordered ray_ban glasses as those were the ones which i wanted only to be offered their own_brand frames which were not even similar , the constant lack of stock appears to be just a ploy to get people ’_s money to then fob them off with whatever they have lying_around .
0	all in all i would never recommend this company to anybody and will be relieve when i have the money back in the back so i never have to deal with them again .
0	they have put me off ordering glasses online again .
0	we received all of our_wedding_invites ( day and evening , reply cards and all envelopes ) earlier this week .
0	i couldn_'_t be_happier .
0	had my reservations_about ordering online but had nothing to worry_about in the end .
0	the invites we chose were very different and the text was arranged beautifully and split in a perfect place !
0	could not be_happier .
0	very quick delivery considering volume of invites ordered - very high_quality too . thank_you so , so much !
0	will definitely be recommending to friends and family in the future .
0	hostelbookers offer valuable information for anyone who is searching for ideal place to stay with better price .

0	nikki was great and helped sort my login problems really quickly .
0	she was very polite and it was nice to be helped without being made to feel like you had done something wrong ^^
0	i ordered a floral_tribute for a funeral service last_week to be in the hearse and then placed outside with the other tributes .
0	they were not in the hearse and did not arrive while we were at the service at all .
0	myself and the other family_members are all witnesses to the fact that they were not there .
0	as if this isn_'_t bad enough , i have got in touch to obtain a refund and they are insisting that they were there and are at the crematorium for me to collect now ( a week_later !!).
0	they have had me ringing the crematorium directly to check ( presumably because i '_m mistaken ???)
0	and have fobbed me off on numerous_occasions regarding my refund .
0	one week_later , still no refund .
0	very upsetting and humiliating .
0	don_'_t entertain using them as they cannot be trusted and offer shocking customer service .
0	i ordered my items late_sunday_night and they were with me by tuesday - great service and very happy with the items .
0	will definitely use again !
0	i '_ve made a purchase with this provider for the first time .
0	the product hasn_'_t been delivered due time as the robot email suggested .
0	when xmas_period time passed , i was mildy surprised , as i received another automatic email prompting me to provide feedback about their quality of service .
0	oh well , it turned_out the shipment has never been delivered , so another free purchase was made .
0	i got mildly suspicious about the speed of delivery of the second ( free order ), this time arriving the very next_day of the purchase , despite the customer_care team told me they didn_'_t have one of the product on the stock , and therefor i would have to wait 0 additional days .
0	perhaps they '_ve forgotten my first shipment ?
0	whatever way , inconsistency in providing information to a customer can make a wonder !
0	update 0th_january_0000 : just received what i believe should be a retention campaign to keep customers .
0	! 0 %_off your next order until a month from today .
0	i am not going to change my shopping behaviour since 00 years , so thanks but the offer has no value to keep me interested shopping further with you .
0	there are means in e_- commerce these days to tailor timely offer to adjust to the customer , not the other way around ...
0	never thought i would use strong words here , but bravofly fuck yourself for ( here comes the list why ):
0	0 ) direct_debit from your card instead of your mobile for calling a customer service for € 0 per_minute ,
0	0 ) offering a return change for 0twice the price of your return ticket ,
0	0 ) for being so cunty about your top on prices , including additional changes in flights ( i . e .
0	no offer of +/- 0_days consecutive flights for a reasonable_price , that would not cost double what i paid in a return ticket .
0	your_own search_engine shows you are just being stingy .
0	also £_00 for a credit_card fee , seriously ?)
0	note to customer service people : i am actually sorry you working for this company , because clearly the stingy way of ripping of customers is embedded in bravofly '_s business model , and nothing you may be able to influence , so may it seems by having talked to one of you .
0	-----------------------------------
0	" if you like to get fucked on the fly , pay for nothing to a stingy @ bravofly "
0	this site was super easy , i found everything i wanted in about 0 mins and booked in 0 .
0	i will use this site again when looking for hostels in europe .
0	great live_chat service by catherine_corless .
0	friendly and professional .
0	i can '_t fault mdp , their delivery times and customer_care team have been fantastic , and as such i would recommend this company without_hesitation .

0	i purchased tickets online march 0rd for a beyonce show on april 00th .
0	i directed the tickets to a friends apartment with my name on it because i did not feel comfortable sending it to my dorm .
0	checked ups tracking later and saw that they had tried to send it to his apartment but needed a signature , so it was sent to corporate goods .
0	ups was suppose to at_least leave a note at the address saying that the package tried to be delivered but they did not .
0	called both ups and viagogo asked what i needed to do , where i was directed to call viagogo where i changed the address .
0	a week_later i received an_email_saying the package was received and that i could not get a refund .
0	confused i went to pick it up and it had not been delivered .
0	called viagogo again and they said they would get back to me but never did .
0	i had also checked online after this and the address to deliver had not changed .
0	i called twice more and received the same " we '_ll get back to you " with no response .
0	when i called a third time i was told that the tickets had been destroyed and there was nothing i could do and i can '_t be refunded .
0	this just feels_like no one was doing their job and i am very upset about it .
0	all i want now is a refund because this was such a hassle with such a terrible result .
0	would buy from iconic_watches again , trustworthy and fast delivery !
0	very happy with my watch .
0	ordered new bike on sunday_evening , delivered first thing tuesday_morning .
0	particularly good when 0 other popular cycling websites claimed they would not have this particular bike in stock until the end of january .
0	excellent customer service ; phoned to confirm i '_d ordered correctly as sizing was slightly out , and advised on best parts for bike .
0	not to mention great podium points_scheme , resulting in me receiving a free helmet and inner_tubes .
0	could not rate them any higher , excellent service .
0	very fast delivery and great to . order from .
0	fantastic quality and would definitely use again .
0	i had a very good experience with this company , absolutely excellent customer service , top_class product and definitely recommend to all my drumming friends
0	i bought from this company through amazon uk , and i was very impressed with the service i received .
0	i did order a clairsonic in the lilac_colour but unfortunately this was out of stock but they quickly informed me of this and offered me to wait the extra time for the lilac one or pick a new colour .
0	i went_ahead and picked a new colour which was then delivered to me very quickly .
0	i was very pleased with the delivery , the contact that i had with this seller and also the product .
0	it came exactly as_described .
0	thanks !
0	i lost my old ghds so was on the hunt for a reliable company who had great prices - beautycow had my ghds at lowest_price i could find .
0	the service was quick and efficient and they came within 0_days just like they had said , which is just what i needed after being without hair_straightners for a week :(, definately would recommend to friends and family and will be using them again .
0	highly_recommended company !

0	priceline never_fails to let_me down with their name your_own price or their express deals .
0	before traveling to toronto , i decided i wanted to stay in a hostel to save the costs , so i decided to google " toronto hostels ".
0	the first two websites that came up for me were hostelworld . com and hostelbookers . com .
0	i chose to look at both , and quickly found that hostelbookers . com '_s prices were generally cheaper , so i decided to stick with them .
0	the website sponsored a hostel called clarence park , which is a hostel that didn_'_t come up through other_websites such as hostels . com .
0	i was very excited because this hostel looked beautiful .
0	i put in my selected dates and it told me there was only 0 room left , so i decided to go_ahead and book it .
0	the next_morning i received an e_- mail from the hostel stating ,
0	" we are emailing to inform you that your reservation cannot be honored .
0	we do not know how your reservation was able to go through as we have not had availability for almost 0 month for these dates .
0	we are contacting hostelbookers immediately to see were they dropped the ball .
0	sorry for any inconvenience !"
0	needless to say i was pissed .
0	it '_s understandable ( though not pleasant ) if there '_s miscommunication between websites of availability within a couple of days , such as if i was trying to book a room for the next two_days , but for a hostel that has_been booked up within the past month .
0	i do not understand how this happened .
0	of course , i decided to read the terms & conditions , and their stance on wrong information is basically that they ' re not perfect , and cannot be held_responsible : " you should note however that we do not warrant that such information will be error free and in using this website you acknowledge that the information provided may include inaccuracies and / or typographical errors ."
0	and if errors are to happen , " we will inform you as soon as reasonably possible if the supplier needs to make a significant change to your confirmed arrangements or to cancel them .
0	we will also liaise between you and the supplier in relation to any alternative_arrangements offered by the supplier but we will have no further liability to you ."
0	i would have much rather paid the more_expensive 0 . 0 % prices of hostelworld , seeing as how when i looked up the hostel and my traveling dates on their website , they provided the correct information .
0	i have used these for 0_weeks now , i found them very cheap , all they always have a different selection of branded items , cheap delivery for 00kgs for 0 . 00
0	i would recommend these , as it will save a fortune
0	easy to use , reliable and the best value hostel site .
0	this website has_been my best friend for a long time !
0	(: i find it very easy too find what i want , the delivery is fast and friendly and the items are much more fairly_priced that anywhere_else ive gone to buy something
0	this website for me is very easy to use , a simple layout that makes it very easy to find the items you want and the service is very friendly
0	this service was very fast and friendly , i wouldnt go_anywhere_else to sell my old_phones
0	i first used iflorist to send flowers to my sick mum in the usa , i have used other_florists in the past but they are becoming so expensive and the choice of flowers are always the same .
0	iflorist are a creative team who you can tell actually love their job by their posts on facebook .
0	i have recommended you many_times to friends , sometimes it '_s good to search for better choices than stick to the ones that we know best .
0	fab service :))
0	ecareers is easily_accessable whenever you need it .
0	it also has a simple home screen that is good to navigate through and find exactly_what you need without needlessly clicking_through pages .
0	the online support_team are extremely_helpful and polite if ever you need help in regards to your account .
0	great product , fully met my expectations .
0	helpful customer service team , i will be ordering from voga again .
0	very good for price , ordered at lunch and it was delivered the next_day .
0	would definitely recommend .
0	i '_ve never rented with other_companies , lovefilm is the first one i '_ve ever used and i will stick to it .
0	despite all the gift cards and vouchers they send every once in a while , their costumer service is awesome .
0	i asked about going on a holiday and because my account was the light use one there was no way i can put it " on a holiday ".
0	i wrote to them and they replied in less_than 0 hours giving me 0 alternative ways to deal with my account .
0	very nice :)
0	came on time , and only took money out when the book came , very good
0	my stuff hasn_'_t come yet , but i already want to give them 00 stars if it is possible .
0	well basically , i was being stupid and accidentally ordered a pair of headphones that were out of stock .
0	the moment i realized my mistake i wrote to their costumer service telling them i want to change .
0	and at 00 o ' clock monday ( i sent my messages on sunday ) they replied that they '_ve provided me a refund and my other headphones were on their way to me .
0	i am so thrilled .
0	i bought a pair of headphones from an_independent seller , when the seller failed to send me my product , amazon refunded me instantly .
0	the independent sellers may not be great but amazon '_s customer support is awesome
0	i can '_t say anything about the customer support because i didn_'_t need it , but the delivery time was great , in the range that they claim to be
0	whenever i need new tyres for my cars i end up using nothing else , but tyreshopper .
0	a good , easy to use homepage with straight_forward options .
0	i have used the same fitting place couple of times_now , the staff was always helpful and friendly .
0	wow got loads of great cds and dvd boxsets at a fraction of the price and all were in very good condition !!
0	great service and cheap delivery - thanks cex !
0	!
0	an simple and quick way to save cash on a purchase you was already going to make .
0	just log in and click on the store you want to buy from and let topcashbacknow . com do the rest !!
0	i cant_believe the amount i have received back making online shopping even better_than before .
0	0st time i had ordered from this site .
0	item came within 0_days and is great - perfect for mother '_s day !
0	!
0	thanks
0	i had problems with the domain being that the previous_owner passed_away and coudnt get to renew it , i was becoming desperate on what to do and how but the customer service online helped_me fast with the precise information i needed .
0	they did not ended the chat until i had all my settings and my date restored , and they made sure i was able to get everything i needed .
0	i call that real good service and real good customer support .
0	i would recomend it always .
0	ok , first of all , they were the cheapest for the 0 hotels i needed , 0 in london for 0 nights and 0 in greece for 0 so there is that .
0	and their new website is ok .
0	the not so good now , they didn_'_t send the email_confirmation straight_away , the login process and access your data for the itinerary is poor quality ( gives no info !)
0	- i have booked in full a transfer which is just resold from a0b transfers and they haven_'_t sent me the voucher because the hotel is only partly paid till 0_weeks before_departure .
0	that is stupid , surely they have no right to use the transfer money as a deposit for anything_else .
0	if you need help and you raise a query , expect long delays for someone to come_back to you and they are never apologetic .
0	i '_d say , use only when they are cheapest .
0	activation key came quickly - about 00_hours after payment ( it does say it may take upto 00_hours , so relatively ...)
0	followed the instructions and after a lengthy download , i was playing bf0 .
0	does what it says on the white carton thing ( yeah i know , not as catchy ).
0	caffeine tablets worked as you imagine .
0	i '_m a small build though so i break the tablet and take just a quarter .
0	i have used mazuma two or three time and have consistently found the service extremely simple and speedy .
0	payment is always prompt and even better now they cab send a faster pay payment directly to your account .
0	i think they are great !
0	i brought two_pairs of glasses from smartbuyglasses i thought the customer service was great !
0	i had placed two_seperate_orders & didnt get a confirmation_email with one of them so i emailed them telling them what had happend i had a response within_00hrs ..
0	within the next couple days i had updates of where my glasses was & when it would be shipped out .
0	they had used dhl to deliver my purchases which including tracking so i knew when & where my order was .
0	delivery does take much longer_than any other company but its worth it at the end for such reasonable_prices .
0	would definately buy from them again !
0	having suffered from arthritis for a few_years i decided to get a steam shower .
0	the steam shower has helped_me feel better , and gives much needed temporary relief .
0	di vapor made the entire_process smooth and i had my steam unit up and running in no time .
0	brill .
0	i '_ve done multiple bets with them and haven_'_t had any_problems .
0	i know other people as well who use them and haven_'_t had any_problems .
0	maybe people write bad_reviews because they lost their money on a bad bet .
0	after trying a different company that promised to unlock my phone and it failing i was hesitant to try again .
0	this worked great and super_fast - they said 00_hours , but not on weekends , i submitted it friday_afternoon and received confirmation sunday_afternoon !
0	this was a great surprise as i expected to not here until tomorrow .
0	thank_you so much for doing exactly as you said even faster_than promised !
0	i got a bit_worried on the length it took to get unlocked .
0	this was probably down to the fact we started the process when the i - phone 0s was just starting to become available .
0	the support was 00 / 00 - really amazing .
0	just got the email_confirming unlock - worked 0st time !
0	thank - you ...
0	i really like this website .
0	i am a student who often looks for cheap hostels !
0	i like the fact i can narrow my options down at a price between £ 0 -£_00 .
0	i always choose this option !
0	i think the reviews are really helpful .
0	the ratings in percentage form are easy to scroll past and see what '_s going to be good quality or not .
0	simple on line service , fast delivery with no_issues at all .
0	so pleased with the product , it was half the price of any of the other_retailers i '_d looked at so i had my doubts_about the quality of the item i must_admit .
0	thrilled when it arrived , much_better_than the others i '_d seen , will definitely be using victoria_plumb again .
0	placed the order needing 0 fancy_dress costumes quickly .
0	no_hassle at all costumes arrived on the day they said .
0	both were brilliant , good quality too compared to other_places i '_ve_used before .
0	will definitely use again .
0	we ordered a kids playhouse from here , and although the house is good we had a nightmare with the service .
0	the order came incomplete and it took about 0_weeks , numerous_emails , being ignored , rude staff and not being_able to get through to call_centre to get it resolved .
0	we had already started putting the house together , had to buy screws because it came without them , and no instructions .
0	have complained to them and received a very insulting " goodwill_gesture ".
0	i would use another company , plenty selling the same sort of thing without the hassle .
0	fast , easy to use site with no_hidden_fees !
0	highly_reccommend to everyone looking to book accomodation !
0	pilates class is just great , perfect for me .
0	i love gomammoth and i would recommend it to everyone .
0	our pilates teacher - joanna - is 000_% professional , lovely , always full of energy , very helpful and understanding .
0	thanks to this wonderful class i can relax , forget about the whole world and just focus on my exercises .
0	great choice of music too !
0	love it !
0	:)
0	i '_ve already bought three kitchen_appliances from appliances_online .
0	i chose them mainly_because they have an option of recycling the old_appliance .
0	there '_s always a problem when you want to replace your old one with a new one .
0	it '_s easy to do with appliances_online .
0	i just had to tick the box that i want my old device to be taken and pay £ 0 . 00 .
0	i think it '_s a fair price for the service .
0	i don_'_t have to worry what to do with , for example , my broken microwave .
0	the other thing i like about app online is that i can watch a video which shows you how the appliance looks like and what it can do .
0	i ordered a mobile phone case from this website .
0	i payed via_paypal , got a confirmation e_- mail from paypal and the money was taken out of my account .
0	0_days_later , i '_d received no correspondence from handtec about the order to say it had been despatched , or indeed that there were any_problems .
0	contacted them today to make_sure everything was ok , and they tell me the order was cancelled because of a problem with payment , even_though the payment has actually gone_through fine !
0	so now in the dark , don_'_t know if i '_ll ever even receive the product , and their e_- mail responses are very slow .
0	don_'_t trust at all .
0	generally cheaper_than other shops and delivery is only £ 0 , which is good
0	cheap phones , good reception , in my room at uni , only vodafone gets any service , and i can call 0 numbers as much as i want for only £ 0 , which is amazing , 0000 times better_than any contract ive seen
0	envolop was delivered quickly , and money came through very quickly , very good service , would use again .
0	we ordered our items on late on thursday_night and received them early saturday_morning .
0	didn_'_t even use next_day delivery .
0	the items we purchased were less_than half the price the exact_same items in major shops .
0	would definitely recommend .
0	the service is easy to use , the checkout_process is really simple especially if you want to reorder the same lenses again .
0	cheaper_than buying direct from your optician and havent had a situation yet where my lenses have been out of stock ( as they so frequently are at the opticians !)
0	can '_t fault delivery either , always super_fast .
0	i placed my order late on sunday_evening , my lenses had arrived by the time i got home from work on tuesday !
0	have already_recommended this site to many friends and will_continue to do so .
0	i had my doubts but decided to put them aside when i received a my voucher_codes discount through email .
0	i '_m so glad i did , i swear the price i paid for my perfume is even better_than duty_free !!
0	i have recommended fragrance_direct to several of my friends and family whom have gone on to place orders for various items and they too have been converted .
0	my only , minor insignificant complaint , is the length of time it took for the parcel to arrive however i accept that could just as easily have been down to the postal service .
0	overall fragrance_direct come highly_recommended and i will most definitely be using them again .
0	just booked a mot for 00 pounds , what a deal
0	i have now got 0 different blinds on my house ..... all from blinds0go !
0	the quality of them is fantastic and the prices are even better !
0	cannot recommend enough !
0	!
0	fast & easy to use .
0	managed to get the product i wanted at a great price .
0	would definitely recommend to others .
0	i had a really good experience using mazuma , i was offered £_000 for my iphone_0g on monday , delivery envelope was received on tuesday and i had received my cheque for £_000 by saturday .
0	a very fast and effective service from mazuma i cannot_fault them in any way and would recommend them to anyone who_wants to sell their old_phones and needs fast cash .
0	i have just completed the excel course .
0	very quick and easy to use .
0	really learnt alot through this which i can apply to my work
0	thank_you for excellent service andy is a gent he was a lovely man and top service provider will be spreading the word to family and friends thanks again x
0	really pleased with my laptop - selling experience ; there was specific data i needed saving which was no problem , they kept me up to date along the way and gave_me a really good price .
0	would use them again .
0	many_thanks !
0	thanks for a great shopping_experience ; i '_m really pleased with the service and the items i bought - the great value deal was also brilliant .
0	i was very impressed .
0	they have the supplements i want and offer to make their price lower_than a competitors .
0	that '_s what got me .
0	i love the fact that i dont have to search the whole site trying to find a certain supplement , it '_s pretty easy and always quick to find what i '_m looking for .
0	i love it !
0	would definitely reccommend to other people !!!!

0	we did cocktail_making on a hen_do in sheffield .
0	it was great fun , there was a great selection of cocktails ( plenty to drink !!!)
0	and the barman was fab !
0	would definately recommend and use again
0	a group of us went to sheffield on a hen_do and did perfume making and a burlesque dance party .
0	funktion_events made it easy for me to arrange as they were so helpful and knowledgeable .
0	the hen was really pleased , as it was a surprise and the rest of the group loved it .
0	i would recommend them to anyone looking to arrange a party .
0	i ordered the chocolate hamper for my mothers_birthday , the order was placed 0_days in_advance .
0	by 0 . 00_pm of the delivery day the hamper has still not been delivered .
0	i have tried to contact the customer service number provided on the webpage but it won_'_t dial .
0	i have contacted eflorist by email but have only received an_automated_response .
0	i am completely disapointed with the service , and very embarrassed that my gift did not arrive .
0	great thankyou [_name_] very helpfull
0	i placed my order late_afternoon and my item was delivered the very next_day .
0	no_problems at all using this site and i would definitely use and reccommend this site again :-)
0	beauty_bay has a good range of products and their service was great , i '_ll be looking here again in future .
0	lovestretch has wonderful service , they send orders out very quickly and have good updates and communications .
0	i am very struck by the brilliant sale pieces .
0	i would not say that i dress in the style suggested ( luxe - lounge ) but i find that the choice and quality of the pieces are able to be worked into my wardrobe , adding items which i may not see elsewhere .
0	i would ask if lovestretch could show how they can reduce the environmental impact of sending clothes by mail , my clothes arrived in very slick and secure postal packet wich was many_times the size of the product i ordered , which no_doubt kept my good nice and safe but seemed wasteful .
0	for example , the company nature shop uses biodegradeble bags and make their commitments to sustainability very clear .
0	i posted something on here last friday and received a call from sonia soon after .
0	but still no sign - sonia , can i have an update please ?
0	infurn have told me it was sent to the courier on 0th_feb but quite honestly given today is 00rd feb this must be a lie ?
0	what courier service takes over 0_weeks ?
0	awful , awful , awful .
0	i wish there was a zero star_rating
0	ordered bean_bag via_groupon on november 00th .
0	expecting it within 0_weeks as promised and as of today february 00th i am still_waiting .
0	was supposed to be a christmas_present for my son
0	infurn don_'_t even respond to emails which i just find incredibly rude .
0	if they just replied and put their hands up and said sorry then i wouldn_'_t mind so much .
0	problem is i still love the product and i know my son will really love it so i am persevering !
0	groupon have been telling_me dispatch dates but they just come and go with no sign
0	honestly don_'_t understand how they can be so awful and still trade , how have they not gone_bust ?

0	i have had superb customer service from order to delivery .
0	even_though there was damage to the original bag , i rang up and my call got answered quickly by a polite , helpful and courteous operative .
0	she did her very best to arrange a new bag to be delivered the next_day , even_though it was the cut_off time for next_day - and it was delievered the next_day !
0	she also said she would call me back if couldn_'_t arrange for next_day .
0	also the price of the item was the cheapest around !
0	i will certainly use this company again if i need other things and very highly_recommend to others .
0	truely fantastic customer service from this company !
0	i bought a pay as u go mobile for my daughter and also a £_00 top up voucher , i had to ring to register the phone and sim and i was told the voucher would take 0 - 0hrs to be added on .
0	0_days and 0 phone_calls later , i am still no further forward .... i asked to speak to the line manager and i was put on hold for a further 00mins only for them to cut me off and again i had to ring back .... its cost me a total of £_00 in calls and at present i am waiting for the manger to call me back ( very much doubt he will !!)
0	this is the worst mobile company i have ever had to deal with , my daughter is very upset as this is her first mobile and she was over the moon when she opened it on her_birthday , as yet she hasnt been able to use her phone .
0	i will never ever use this company again , i only wish i had bought a different ohone on a different network , im going to get the phone unlocked and put her on a different network .. absolutely_disgusting ..

0	i went into an electrical store to purchase a dyson but came out with something totally different brand , this was partial to do with price and functions against other models and the staff_members recommendation .

0	i wanted to get some flowers for a friend to brighten_her day ; unfortunately , she_lives in liverpool and i live in northamptonshire .
0	i googled ' flower delivery liverpool ' to see if there were any local_florists nearby and came_across serenetaflowers which looked ace !
0	i ordered the adore bouquet as she_loves red_roses and once they arrived i received a lovely text from her thanking_me .
0	she says they were absolutely_beautiful !
0	i '_ll definitely use this service again , thank_you !
0	so it was my mother - in - law - to - be '_s birthday .
0	i '_d already decided i needed to get her some flowers but i could leave the house due to having to wait for building regulations guys to come check out the work done on our house .
0	i placed the order around 00am and , guess_what ?
0	the delivery girl was knocking on my door by 0pm !
0	i was absolutely amazed_at how quick and easy the service was .
0	though the bouquets themselves plus delivery is a bit much pricewise , i '_m still impressed at the service and will most_likely use again !
0	i love this website , the stuff is really good and whenever i order i get really nice clothes or trainers not_necessarily available in my local sports store and i like the fact i can track my stuff on their website after they send it
0	this was a really good find for reasonably_priced flowers i loved the fact i could choose which date i could get my flowers and they came in perfect_condition with a vase .
0	recommended
0	excellent communication and very quick service , the website is easy to navigate and makes it clear where prescriptions are required .
0	would recommend this site to everybody .
0	i found that double0tickets gave_me the best service over any other ticket agent i have booked with before .
0	their website was fast , clear and easy to use .
0	once you booked your received an_email_confirmation that your tickets had been booked .
0	i then received a text the day before my tickets were dispatched to confirm that they were being sent out .
0	amazingly great service and i will definitely re - use again .
0	so simple , easy and fast .
0	sent the phone off on tuesday and the money was in my account on wednesday .
0	very impressed with whole service
0	i was due to receive a parcel yesterday between 00 . 00 - 00 . 00 .
0	on the lovely map they sent me , it was due to be delivered to my work .
0	however the emails said it was my home address .
0	i was at work all day , and i work on reception , and nothing was delivered .
0	i then return home after work to no calling_card there either .
0	there are no telephone_numbers like some other courier companies , to speak to someone about whats happened .
0	i then check the tracking and it says the parcel was refused !!
0	by who ??
0	i then log on this morning to see that it is being held at the romford depot .
0	i cannot call as there is no number , and i have no calling_card ?!
0	so what do i do ?
0	?
0	i ordered online with mdp_supplies and received my package very quickly .
0	the courier company they use is very efficient and communication great .
0	mdps website is informative and easy to navigate and they have a wide_range of quality products .
0	i bookmarked their site after my first order and have returned on more than one occasion to make further_purchases !
0	vackra blommor levererade i tid
0	i purchased this last night and i still have not received any emails saying it was successful ??
0	imei is correct ive made sure does it usually take this long its been almost 00_hrs ??
0	?
0	surfdome used to be my number one online shop to visit for anything !
0	i have spent_hundreds of £'_s on the website and have always been 000_% happy with the service ...
0	im going on holiday tomorrow , and after ordering some items for next_day delivery on monday , i still won_'_t be receiving before my holiday .
0	the reason for this is because they sent it to an incorrect_address 0 hours away from where i live !
0	i looked at the tracking and called the customer service line , and they said it would be sorted for me , and nothing changed !
0	i rang again today and they have told me that there is nothing they can do now even_though all of the items are still in stock .
0	oh ...
0	but they have told me they will ring me later today to try and get it sorted again ... at 0pm !
0	there is no way i will have anything ive ordered before i go away and i am thoroughly disappointed .
0	some may say that i shouldn_'_t leave it so last_minute and its my own fault as problems do occur sometimes ...
0	but as i used to trust surfdome so much and never had problems ...
0	i though it would be fine .
0	it '_s the incompetence of the customer_services team that is the worst part of it all !!
0	!
0	surfdome is a great online shop , but i wouldn_'_t recommend ordering anything that you need asap , or trust their customers service team because they have only let_me down !
0	easy website to find your way around , and completely spoilt for choice !
0	!
0	received the items wrapped thoroughly and in pristine_condition !
0	will definitely use again and highly_recommend !!
0	!
0	thank_you fancy_dress ball !
0	i '_ve ordered a few_times from sputnik , and both_times i '_ve had queries about the items .
0	i emailed before purchase , and all of my questions were answered by the next_day and i '_ve gone ahead with the purchase .
0	the items have always been sent and received in perfect_condition and so quickly !!
0	the prices are really good and they will definitely receive more orders from me !
0	would recommend to anyone !
0	!
0	i ordered a dyson_vacuum from this company .
0	i received it so quickly after following the simple instructions of payment on the website .
0	after i placed the order i received email_confirmation really quickly , and was able to track my order on the courier website aswell .
0	i will use this company again and recommend it to anyone !
0	i rang up recently to ask about a few products .
0	i passed my bike test and have planned to travel around_europe with friends for a few_months .
0	i spoke to a girl on the phone and asked about loads of satnavs , bluetooth headsets , charging cables for the products , mapping updates ... the lot !
0	i couldn_'_t_believe_how knowledgeable they were of every product i asked about , and if she wasn_'_t sure she would find out the answer so quickly !
0	i ended_up getting everything i needed and it was all sent to me the next_day !
0	the products were brand_new and so cheap .
0	the satnav was newly overhauled but it was perfect !
0	exactly like new , just a different box !
0	i would reccommend this company to anyone because of how well i was looked after by them
0	well_done globalgps !
0	i look_forward to buying more products from you in the near_future , and my trip !
0	delivery arrived the morning after i ordered even_though i placed it late_afternoon .
0	loved the raccoons as a kid .
0	i bought 0 tickets for boxing on sat .
0	traveling friday .
0	have been panicking all day , phoned viagogo twice .
0	both_times spoke to friendly staff who explained they can come the day before the event , it '_s the individual who has sold viagogo the ticket who hasn_'_t sent them to me yet ( they contacted the seller on the 00st_may to ship them to me , so i dont understand_why the seller holds on to them for so long ).
0	they said they would get them sent to the hotel we were staying at in london if they hadn_'_t come by thursday .
0	also reassured me i could potentially collect them from the venue if the seller lets me down .
0	this evening i have had an_email_saying dispached .
0	not got them yet but i '_m feeling slightly more at ease !
0	i do feel that the seller should be made to send viagogo the tickets or to the buyer by a decent deadline .
0	these tickets have been released ages_ago .
0	it '_s really unfair to make us wait to the very last_minute and get so stressed out about it .
0	the seller could have easily decided they don_'_t want to sell them anymore - at the last_minute !
0	what do they gain from hanging onto them ?
0	i don_'_t begrudge paying over the odds for an event of a lifetime but the stress of thinking we ' re not going to get to go is awful .
0	a trustworthy and efficient service !
0	i send my phone off to them at the beginning of the month - 0th_jan - ( after they failed to collect it twice !)
0	i was skeptical of these types of companies so took multiple phones of my phone before i sent it .
0	i followed up with them after the ten day period and they advised they had lost my phone , it wasnt until the 00st of jan that they located it .
0	they then advised me i would be receiving no funds because the phone had water_damage .
0	i had checked before ( and had photos ) and i had not had any water_damage therefore it would have occurred whilst they had lost my phone .
0	they are refusing to acknowledge the damage was caused by them .
0	for god sake dont use them .
0	i had a photo collage done of me and my boyfriend for xmas , it '_s so cute and looks fabulous !
0	much_better_than i was expecting , and is taking pride of place in our house :) couldn_'_t be more pleased .
0	when i can '_t be bothered to cook or go out and get something locally , my go - to is almost always just - eat .
0	i love the fact that there are so many different cuisine options that are easily_accessible to me ; it makes deciding what i want for lunch / dinner much_easier as sometimes i will go on with absolutely no idea what i feel like .
0	a lot of the time , i end up finding takeaways that i never knew were close by , or i discover new takeaways that have just opened in my area .
0	another great point is that they allow you to review those restaurants on their site - this makes sifting_through restaurants much_easier and gives you more reassurance .
0	no one wants to make an order , whilst hungry , only to have your food arrive 0 hours_later , so being_able to read_reviews means you know which restaurants have a good reputation and which do not .
0	i have had some bad_experiences with some restaurants but just - eat themselves were never the problem .
0	all i had to do was leave a bad_review for that restaurant to warn_others of my experience , and never order from them again .
0	problem_solved .
0	on the occasions when restaurants have cancelled my order for various_reasons , just - eat '_s customer service has_been excellent , as they will always text me to let_me know , if not call .
0	this is much preferable to email as i don_'_t always check it immediately !
0	it saves the trouble of sitting_around , waiting for over an_hour , only to go on my pc , check my emails and be disappointed to find that my order had been cancelled and i will in fact not be eating within the next 00_minutes .
0	the new - ish app is also very handy , though makes naughty orders quite easy ...
0	in fact i don_'_t keep the app '_s button on my main screen anymore so i am not tempted so often !
0	the only improvement i can suggest is to go the hungryhouse direction - offer the meal free if the order is more than 00_minutes .
0	this means the restaurants that are with just - eat have to step up their game and it guarantees the customers are not disappointed .
0	if my food didn_'_t turn_up within the time - frame given , i '_d be mollified by the fact that it would be free .
0	whenever parcels have been sent to me from online_retailers via_dpd , i '_ve always had a good experience .
0	my orders have arrived in timely_fashion and i really appreciate the text update to let_me know the hour time - frame they will deliver between .
0	this is such a great idea as , unlike with some other couriers , i do not have to wait in from 0am - 0pm with no more specific indication of what sort of time they might arrive .
0	no one enjoys wasting an entire day , eg .
0	if the delivery comes at 0pm and you realise you could have gone out and done plenty of other things in that time .
0	my most_recent delivery was today , sent from asos ; i was sent a text and an_email_saying it would arrive between 00 :_00am - 00 :_00pm .
0	the parcel arrived at 00 :_00am , very pleased with dpd '_s time - keeping .
0	i '_m so glad asos has chosen to either stop using myhermes or at_least does not use myhermes for next_day deliveries .
0	i '_ve not yet needed to use the redelivery via_text , but i think it '_s fantastic that they give you the option to choose whether you '_d like to delivered to a neighbour or delay delivery for up to two_days .
0	keep_up the good job , guys .
0	update 00 / 00 / 00 : i have another parcel being delivered by dpd for today and during the tracking process , i '_ve just noticed the " follow my parcel " section and i love it !
0	i love knowing exactly where my delivery driver is , and which delivery he is currently making , and how long it will take him to get to me .
0	see you in about 0 hours , bill !
0	i really like the variety of items that asos offers , and usually i do not have a problem with asos whatsoever in terms of item quality or pricing .
0	one of the reasons i am giving asos 0_stars is because of the unfortunate problem that they still use myhermes .
0	i will not go into detail about my horrible_experience with myhermes here - if you click my profile to see my other reviews on trustpilot , you will be able to find my review for myhermes .
0	the other reason i am not giving any higher than 0_stars is because of their customer service .
0	it is frustrating when there is no contact number and my only options are to wait for a response through email or via their facebook_page , which are usually very slow ( barring the automated_messages saying they have a high_volume of emails ).
0	when i had my problem with an order due to myhermes , asos were essentially useless and just asked me to " wait a little_longer " and to contact them if it still had not arrived by a certain_date .
0	it did not , so i messaged them back on facebook , only to receive a reply several days_later , after the order finally arrived a week_later than i was told it would .
0	of the three queries i sent in via their contact form on their website , only one was responded to by an actual person , and they only told me things i already knew / could find on their website , rather_than answering my actual question .
0	my returns experience was hassle - free , and i '_m pleased that i could return items free of charge , with no random fees deducted from my refund , and also that they send a confirmation of receipt of the return .
0	due to myhermes being a pain in the bum in regards to standard delivery , i chose to go premier with asos so hopefully i will not have to go through the whole debacle of trying to locate my order again .
0	i certainly hope i never have to contact customer_care again , as they are rather useless .
0	i returned an order on 00 / 00 / 00 as some of the items did not suit me , and one of the items i requested an exchange as it looked of poor quality ( i took a photo , sent it with a cover letter in the parcel , as well as emailed customer_care with the same cover letter & photo ).
0	i emailed on 00 / 00 / 00 asking if they '_d received my return yet , and was replied to the next_day saying they had not .
0	today , 00 / 00 / 00 , i received an_email from missguided '_s customer_care team saying that the item i wanted to exchange was out of stock and they have simply refunded me for it .
0	everything '_s totally fine , responses were quite speedy , and the refund was processed relatively quickly compared to most online companies i '_ve had to return stuff to .
0	all sounds great , shining customer service ... until i noticed an " adjustment fee " deducted from my refund .
0	i have scoured their entire website , from their returns & exchanges policy to every_single section of their terms & conditions , and could not find any sign of the reason for this fee .
0	it is also suitably vaguely named - adjustment fee ?
0	what are they adjusting ?
0	it cannot be the fee charged for return shipping as i did not use their provided sticker , as i preferred to send it myself via another method .
0	i stated this in the cover letter included in the returns parcel as well as in the email sent to customer_care .
0	then what could this mysterious fee be ?
0	it sounds very sneaky , and though it is not a great amount of money (£ 0 . 00 ), it is the principle of it that is the issue .
0	due to this bizarre " fee " deducted from my refund , i decided to check out their other claim - that the item i requested for exchange was no_longer in stock in the size i wanted .
0	lo and behold , on their website , the item is still available to purchase in the size i wanted .
0	working for an online_retailer myself , i know that if i was going to let a customer know an item was out of stock , i would ensure the item was listed as such on the website before emailing the customer .
0	this seems petty but can be a massive inconvenience as well as disappointment , and i know from both_sides of it that we do not want the customers to go through the hassle of changing their order or waiting for a refund , if we can help it .
0	i have emailed missguided '_s customer_care team once more , requesting information of both of those issues , and wait eagerly for their response .
0	it really is such a shame as i was actually planning on making another order at the end of the month , but will no_longer be doing so .
0	update 00 / 00 / 00 : was emailed by missguided to say that the " adjustment fee " was actually the charge for returns postage , despite the fact that i told them i would not be using their sticker .
0	my returns sticker was hand - written , for christ '_s sake !
0	still do not understand_why they '_ve called it an " adjustment fee " rather_than " returns postage fee ", which would make it entirely less vague .
0	they also firmly stated that the product i wanted was definitely out of stock on their website .
0	funnily_enough , i checked there and then and found that not only is it still available , i could also add that particular item in that particular size into my basket and attempt to pay for it .
0	i screenshotted it with a timestamp , and sent it to them along with a requested proof of postage , which seems really petty of them for a mere £ 0 . 00 .
0	essentially their customer service is a complete farce .
0	i really am disappointed as i was looking_forward to my next order come payday .
0	why_bother when they '_ll probably do this all again if i find i have to return more unsuitable items ?
0	i made an order with a big online retail company who unfortunately use hermes .
0	the order was placed on a friday , and i was pleasantly_surprised to get a confirmation_email_saying the parcel had been dispatched on the saturday .
0	obviously i '_m not one of those idiots who think it might arrive the next_day because to paraphrase uncle vernon , " no post on sundays ".
0	on tuesday i tracked the parcel to see that it was supposedly at the depot , ready to be delivered on wednesday , which was also the day the retailer claimed it would arrive , latest .
0	the next_day , it was claimed to be " out for delivery " from 0am .
0	it did not arrive this day .
0	didn_'_t think it would take over 00_hours to deliver it from a depot unless the depot was actually in scotland , but i patiently_waited another day without complaint .
0	tracking on thursday told me the same info , that somehow the delivery person must have been looking high and low for over 00_hours for a business address in central_london that received and sent post every_single weekday .
0	at this point i decided to try to contact hermes .
0	how silly and naive of me to think this would be a simple phone_call or email .
0	after going through a bunch of faq questions , as if i wouldn_'_t have already exhausted that resource , i reached an impasse - they were conveniently " contractually unable to discuss the order " with anyone other than the retail sender .
0	annoyingly the retailer does not have a " call_centre " ( considering i read on wikipedia that this company have over 000 workers , could they not even spare 0 to pick_up a phone ?
0	), so i emailed and facebook messaged them only to get unsatisfactory automated_responses .
0	still i had nothing to do but wait .
0	at 0pm today , the thursday of the aftermath , hermes updated their tracking page for the order .
0	" hallelujah !
0	", you might think .
0	no , it turns_out they deleted the part where it was apparently out for delivery , to replace it with " receipt at depot .
0	processed at depot ."...
0	which is exactly_what the previous two steps said .
0	which suggests to me that the delivery person could not be arsed to find my workplace , left it in the van for two_days , then returned it to the depot , where my order still is as of 0pm .
0	hermes managed to deliver an order made by my sister , after i placed my order , from the same retailer , so it seems not all of their drivers are useless , but i '_d still give hermes a sad , singular star because not even bothering to try and deliver parcels is ridiculous .
0	i really hope all online_retailers take into account the fact that hermes continously receives 0_star_ratings and has an overall 0_star_rating ( i '_m_sure it would be 0_stars if most people had their way ), and switch to a different , more reliable ( even if only slightly more ) courier .
0	nothing could be worse_than hermes .
0	except maybe tom cruise '_s dead eyes .
0	i was recommended to getlenses ( postoptics at the time ) by a family_member who already purchased from this site .
0	it was around the time i first started_wearing lenses , so i was dubious_about buying online when the deal with my opticians seemed so good !
0	it didn_'_t take me long to realise that almost all opticians charge you heck of a lot more than if you just purchased a year '_s worth online , even if you factor in solution .
0	there was also the whole_thing where i could choose what lenses i wanted to try , instead of what the opticians wanted me to try ( the most expensive ones !).
0	after 0 years of buying contacts ( of both clear and coloured varieties ) from getlenses , i would never look to anywhere_else .
0	i was drawn to charterhouse as i was in the market for a new , smallish tank for a betta ; i did so much research over various_websites , even looking at used ads .
0	turns_out charterhouse was the cheapest around for what i wanted - even second - hand tanks the same size ( or smaller !)
0	cost more .
0	i made my choice to go with charterhouse , and i was assured that my tank + equipment would arrive on a tuesday .
0	and arrive on a tuesday they did !
0	it was well - packaged ( so much bubblewrap fun now ) and i am very satisfied .
0	even with one order taking longer_than_expected due to being short on some stock , they were kind enough to let_me cancel the two out - of - stock items out of three in the order and refunded me for them , instead of cancelling the entire order and me having to order the third item again .
0	all in all , i would definitely shop at charterhouse again , and fully recommend it to others .
0	this is the first time i '_ve_used lakeland '_s online ordering service .
0	bought a nespresso_coffee_maker .
0	it arrived within a matter of days , well_packaged and the transaction was absolutely hassle_free .
0	thank_you lakeland .
0	if i '_m looking for electrical products i will definitely use you again .
0	five_stars !
0	placed an order with laura_ashley three_weeks_ago .
0	nothing arrived so rang last_week to find out when i could expect it .
0	surly customer service peron said it was in the warehouse and ready to be despatched .
0	made me feel_guilty for daring to ask !!
0	this morning i found it hadn_'_t actually been sent " because they were very busy ".
0	sad really , over the years i '_ve spent so much money with this company , but as there are many alternatives who are so much_better and less expensive i don_'_t think i '_d shop with laura_ashley again .
0	what the hell .
0	i '_m only a customer !
0	rarely have i seen such diabolical feedback anywhere than here .
0	surely we can '_t all be wrong !
0	i have already put a review on about this company and their response , as you will see is “ we believe customer guarantees should be guaranteed ( doesn ’_t make_sense , i know ) and therefore would be happy to offer you a full_refund or free exchange and will also reimburse you for all your postage_costs .
0	“ i was then contacted someone in the complaints_department .
0	without_hesitation , i was offered an_immediate full_refund which i was told would appear on my statement in four days , and a replacement pair as a goodwill_gesture ( which i declined ).
0	i returned the glasses and waited for the promised refund .
0	that was december .
0	in january , with no sign of the promised refund , i rang and spoke to emily the delightful customer_services manager .
0	she denied ever receiving the glasses back , nor that anyone other than her would have the authority to make such a promise .
0	she said unless i had it in writing , they would not honour the promise .
0	i found her very rude to deal with , constantly talking over me until i nearly lost the will to live .
0	subsequently i wrote to the md to make a complaint about my dealings with her and the firm in general .
0	no surprise i never received so much as an acknowledgment .
0	i expect he either needed her permission to respond or “ they never received the letter ”.
0	i have lost in excess of £_00 for glasses plus two lots of return postage .
0	happily i now have a pair of glasses that are spot_on from another firm .
0	if you ’ re happy to throw money away , go_ahead – buy from these_cowboys .
0	otherwise , stay away !
0	i had never used double0_tickets before and i was dubious but the tickets i ordered last_week have arrived this morning by special delivery and i '_m over the moon .
0	great service and a realiable company , i will_definatley use them agian !
0	selected next_day delivery expecting it to arrive sat , for me to wear the clothing sat night .
0	it didn_'_t arrive , no communication .
0	fair_enough sometimes this happens .
0	i expected it mondau and received an_email to say it would be delivered between_0am - 0pm - again it didn_'_t arrive .
0	no card through the door , no email or phone_call .
0	i had to call weds , both dx and ax paris to be told my full address wasn_'_t adequate , their driver couldn_'_t find my house .
0	lesson_learnt ; i need to be able to mind read !
0	i asked for the parcel to be delivered to my parents house , built over 00years , a fully established postcode ...... weds , no delivery ....... no email , no call ...... finally thurs it turns_up .
0	a week_later than when i ordered and paid for next_day delivery .
0	i now have to return as the items have arrived far too late .
0	and you want me to rate you ??!!!!!
0	!
0	bought plenty from jokers_masquerade before - never had any_issues :)
0	i just have to say that this site is amazing and i am so pleased with my products .
0	everything was in perfect_condition and the delivery speed is spot_on .
0	and they keep you informed of how your order is doing .
0	the first time i ordered , one of the products wasn_'_t available but they sent me something in exchange that was very close to what i wanted .
0	thats not something you experience form most online companies .
0	i will most definately keep using this site , thank_you so much :) xx
0	after finding a lovely engagement_ring on the high_street which cost far too much (£ 0000 ), me and my boyfriend decided to shop around after all it had to be right cost wise as well as being the one we wanted .
0	we were very scared about buying something so expensive on the internet , but can now say with 000_% confidence - that we have no_regrets in doing so .
0	in fact we are very glad we used infinity - jewellery . com .
0	they have a wide_range of engagement_rings and they allow you to customise your order .
0	we were impressed to find out that a very similar looking ring to the one we had seen on the high - street was available for just £_000 !
0	hoping for the best , we placed our order .
0	it arrived after 0 business days .
0	i really like the ring , it '_s stunning and even more beautiful than the photos on the web_site .
0	it came in a well - presented box and with all the relevant certifications .
0	the next week i actually took the ring along with the diamond certificate to a local jewellery store and they confirmed the diamond certificate .
0	so if you still have any_doubts let_me leave you with this , i '_ve told all my friends about this website .
0	a month has passed and i still cant_believe i have such a stunning engagement_ring !
0	rustic_stone went above and beyond and turned a fantastic memorial_stone around in record_time !!
0	the stone was replicated perfectly to our design and will be a cherished memorial to our much loved nan !
0	would definitely reccommend and use again !
0	used a voucher_code from mighty_deals "£ 00 worth of flowers for £_00 "
0	i am just glad that i hadn_'_t actually spent £_00 on them , didn_'_t expect them to be delivered in a cardboard_box they were also disappointingly small and just less that 00_hours , the roses and gerbera '_s are wilting and the lilies don_'_t look like they ' re even going to open !
0	wish i '_d gone to morrisons , spent the £_00 plus delivery on the beautiful bunches they have !
0	i absolutley love surfdome , they have such a large range of clothes and accessories .
0	the sales are always great .
0	the prices they offer for branded clothes are great aswell as what they have to offer for its own_brand .
0	delivery prices are reasonable and often free with a voucher_code and returns are free aswell through collect_+, and they accept nus so you can save even more .
0	cheap , good products , quick delivery and great idea to use bybox makes getting deliveries so much_easier .
0	i saw their ad while_searching for a camera on amazon .
0	because of the competitive price they offered i decided to give this company a try .
0	and it turned_out that their service was amazing - very efficient and very responsible - at every_stage of the dispatch / delivery i '_d get an_email to confirm and reassure things were going fine .
0	i also received a text this morning stating the exactly time period my package should be arriving - and it did arrive on time !
0	it '_s been a very good experience shopping with them , and i would totally recommend bestcameras !
0	( this is actually my first time writing a review on any websites !
0	i just felt i had to give them some positive_feedback !)
0	i was really impressed with the speedy delivery , i purchased the underfloor_heating for my ensuite and bedroom , great product .
0	the tile backing boards are almost_half the price than in b_& q .
0	i would recommend this company without_hesitation
0	i ordered a pink floyd shirt which i could not find anywhere_else .
0	it arrived within the time specified and the quality was just as i hoped .
0	the sizing was just right , as i am always worried_about when buying online !
0	they have a few more rare designs that i intdend to purchase soon .
0	highly_recommended !
0	recently bought an oil rig and a few glass dabbers from this company .
0	i am very impressed with the quality of the craftsmanship .
0	plus they have designs i have not seen anywhere_else , they actually are unique as claimed on the website .
0	prices are quite reasonable and shipping went fine also .
0	i highly_recommend this company .
0	recently received a handmade purse from that i ordered on esty .
0	was very happy with the item .
0	they make things so much_easier than ebay , if anyone has not heard of them do check it out .
0	will be ordering via etsy anytime i have to buy gifts !
0	i will be ordering again from btcsunglasses . com , i just got my first pair of fake ray - ban_sunglasses from them and i am quite satisfied with the quality and price .
0	their selection is pretty extensive as well , i think i '_ll go for some fake oakley_sunglasses next .
0	i '_ve gotten some good deals but have also been burned by some sellers who sell counterfeit ... got to be careful !
0	my favorite place to get the daily news and see what programs are on for the week
0	this site came up as the lowest_price for for an ipod_touch so i proceeded to place my order .
0	the item showed up the next_day in perfect_condition .
0	highly_recommended seller .
0	i was a little_dubious to begin with as id read a lot of bad_reviews , but within 0_weeks of ordering and over a month before the event , my tickets have arrived as promised .
0	will definitely be recommending double0 to friends and family :)
0	brilliant price for some michael mcintyre tickets , ordered on friday_evening , arrived on tuesday , very fast service !
0	tickets came well ahead of show date too , very impressed
0	will definitely be using double0 again !
0	very reasonable_prices and speedy delivery .
0	gorgeous flowers .
0	would recommend to others and definitely will be using again .
0	extensive choice for all ages , fast , free delivery , easy to negotiate website , great sales !
0	this is a good site for selling second_hand good and also purchasing .
0	it is possible to list ads for items wanted aswell .
0	you can post free ads but if you want to promote your ad it will cost .
0	you can upload 0 free pics as well for your ad .
0	as with things like this always sell face to face and be careful if you are unsure .
0	i would recommend as you can find some interesting items on here .
0	there are jobs pages aswell .
0	update_: i still enjoy looking at gumtree but be very very careful if you are selling , anyone who_asks you to give out your paypal email address because they will give you an extra £_00_-£_00 for postage is scamming you and should be reported immediately .
0	i have shopped in hmv a lot over the years and prefer spending my money instore rather_than online .
0	when i have ordered online i have either had my item dispatched and recieved within 0_days or i have had to wait 0_days to be dispatched dispite it being in stock .
0	this has happened 0 or 0 times and now if not dispatched in the time it states i just cancel and try and find the product elsewhere even if i have to spend a few more pounds .
0	one item i did order was meant to be 0 discs but was only a 0 disc cd so they should probably check their product details .
0	not sure_whether i would recommend their online service .
0	i think they are a great company and i have used them several_times when ordering beads and findings for making my jewellery for my site .
0	i have always had my items dispatched promptly and arrived within 0_days so i would highly_recommend .
0	brilliant site , i make jewellery so like to source interesting and different beads .
0	i have had to contact customer service on one occasion as i had something not turn_up , when i phoned they asked me what i would like to have sent as that has_been out of stock and they posted it out and i recieved the next_day .
0	prices are reasonable and you can pay by paypal aswell which is great .
0	highly_recommended company .
0	i have used play . com for just over 0 years_now and have always recieved excellent service .
0	when ordering pre_- orders they guarantee that the price if lowered is the price you will pay and also they do not take any money until it is ready to be dispatched .
0	i have recieved pre_- orders before the actual release date on several_occasions .
0	most orders are delivered in 0 - 0_days from dispatch .
0	they now have a whole range of items from books , gadgets , toys and even electrical items .
0	quick delivery of international dvds , never had a problem with them and great customer service , all dvds are region 0 so ensure you player can play them .
0	prices can be a little high but there are no taxes to pay to ship them into the uk .
0	one to recommend .
0	so many bad_reviews online i should have listened to .
0	booked my car in on monday for a mobile fitting service of two tires , to come on wed ( the day before my pre_- booked pre_- paid mot appointment ) on tuesday got a call confirming the address and to say that i would get a call 00mins before the fitting ( which was in a 0 : 00 - 0 : 00 , time_slot ) wed came and i know i should have called earlier in the day but was giving them the benefit of the doubt , when i called late in the afternoon , they said they couldn_'_t fit me in today and had changed the appointment to thursday and that he was surprised no one had called and let_me know , all they could offer was to get someone to call me the next_morning , which doesn_'_t really work when i have an mot booked first thing .
0	pathetic customer service especially for a large company , now i have to wait a week for a refund !
0	and am out of pocket on an mot i will fail .
0	have learnt my lesson and will stick to supporting the local community !
0	i have used them once before as well .
0	very easy , very quick , from filling in the online form to payment to my bank_account was less_than a week .
0	well it was one of those gifts that people never expect , and i gave it to a friend of mine .
0	her day was made !
0	she never expected a pillow with her face on it ahahahah !
0	well honestly , she loved it .
0	we are much_better friends now because of photoworld cewe .
0	thank_you thank_you thank_you .
0	you guys are the bomb !
0	:) xo
0	all the products are very affordably priced .
0	there is a wide_variety and a sundry range of products , items , gifts , flowers , sweets , and amazing other stuff to choose from .
0	the categories are truly incredible .
0	and last but never the least , the service is sweet , friendly , punctual , easy to manage , and very efficient , each time , every time .
0	this is awesome work , a gift to us .
0	thankyou .

0	best phone_recycling company there is !!
0	!
0	will be telling all my freind and family
0	just received the money .
0	it took a little_longer_than i thought but i got the money .
0	sorry for bad_review
0	very easy to use , it has a quick search_engine within the site , found exactly_what i wanted first time .
0	very user_friendly .
0	it was actually easier using this site than the hostel '_s own site !
0	it was also cheaper which is great .
0	it was really quick and easy to use , no confusion and need to double_check for a " catch " and the ten % payment means you don_'_t have to hand over all your cash until you '_ve seen the place you are staying .
0	excellent service .
0	my email_confirmation came through within about 00 seconds .
0	got a really good price on my order , better even than amazon .
0	delivery was fast , which was great as it was for a birthday .
0	very happy with the service from gamegears , will definitely shop_here again .
0	had a large hen group of 00 so knew i would need help organising such a big event .
0	after a long discussion with terri from the company over the phone we came to a decision that bristol would be the place for the group .
0	she was very helpful and let_me know of any changes and updates very quickly !
0	the hen_do itself went very well , everyone agreed that it was excellent value for money : 0_star hotel including breakfast , 0 course_meal and drink , strip_show and nightclub entry all for £_00 !
0	when we got to the hotel we realised that one room was around £_000 so excellent deal !
0	brilliant night had by all !
0	the only one negative i would have is the website .
0	some of my group did not receive emails even_though their emails address '_s were correct and some people were unable to get onto the website at all .
0	other than this we all thoroughly_enjoyed ourselves so thank_you very much chillisauce for taking the pressure off of me to organise such a big event !
0	invitations were beautiful and better_than_expected .
0	the order was delivered quicker_than_expected .
0	the packaging was wonderful .
0	to all the brides to be out there , use this site !!!!!
0	!

0	it was so quick and easy to order and they were delivered within a couple of days !
0	absolutely love my glasses and sooo happy with them !
0	would totally recommend this website !
0	i have just placed my third order in as many weeks from animed .
0	their prices are so much_cheaper_than our vets for exactly the same product .
0	my cat has recently had a bad case of fleas which is always costly but the indorex spray is half the price my vet_charges and the free_postage makes it better to order online .
0	also my cat is on royal_canin gastro food that i have been buying from my vets for over a year and paying £_00 for 0kg , today i have bought 0kg for £_00 . 00 from animed .
0	a massive_saving .
0	their website is easy to use , i can always find what i need and checkout is so straightforward .
0	this really is a first_class website for your pet products !
0	many_thanks , received order today , really beautiful , have
0	a good and prosperous 0000 and you will be hearing from me again , excellent
0	service , well_done xx
0	i '_ve_used all beauty several_times_now .
0	they have a great range of products at very good competitive_prices .
0	very quick delivery and free_postage which is brilliant .
0	all beauty will always be my first choice when looking for my favourite_perfume .
0	can highly_recommend .😀
0	divine_trash is a lush shop that sells fantastic clothes at very reasonable_prices .
0	you can buy outfits for every_occasion .
0	they also have fab jewellry , shoes and make up too .
0	delivery service is quick and reliable .
0	the staff are wonderful and help you and give you great advice .
0	if you come to buxton make_sure you visit this lovely shop :-)
0	seriously do not use this scamming company !!
0	!
0	oh god i am fuming !
0	sent my old_blackberry to this company to have the excessive cosmetic damaged email .
0	logged_onto cash0phones and to check status and there is was " excessive scratches to screen ".
0	sorry but not buying it .
0	the item was sent in very good condition for the age and was packed with bubble_wrap and posted off .
0	was offered £_00 now offered £_00 !!!!!
0	no chance !
0	and not prepared to pay £ 0 . 00 to have phone back .... which is just another way to rip someone off and get them to accept the very low revised price !!!
0	emailed them today and will wait_until tomorrow to see if i have a reply .
0	if not then i will get on the phone and let rip !
0	how can a company operate this way !!!
0	!
0	people do not use this company !!!!
0	my mission now it to make_sure as many people as possible know about this company ......... utter scam_artists !!!!
0	!
0	simply buy the things you normally would but click through_topcashback and make some ' free ' cash .
0	simply fab !
0	the only_downside is it can take sometime ...
0	genuine products , great prices & prompt delivery .
0	all great !
0	easy to use website , simple process to post off my phone .
0	fab communication at every_step of the way via emails .
0	very speedy bank_transfer !
0	all in all faultless ...
0	my only worry is with royal_mail .
0	i made sure i posted my device special delivery for insurance level purposes .
0	i am very disappointed with the service which i received from this company .
0	i have used them many_times in the past however , on this occasion has changed my opinion i sent off a perfectly working phone with no damage !
0	however i was told this arrived with a cracked_screen !!!!
0	the fact they only give you a pathetic jiffy_bag and if dropped or chucked around by royal_mail can damage the goods i get penalised for it !
0	- what a joke so i was forced to accept a small_amount for the phone or they return the damaged which has no value to me now .
0	secondly i wrote an e_- mail expressing my feelings as i disagree that i should be deducted the damage incurred through postage they haven ’_t even replied - what great service i re - sent the e_- mail 0_days_later as their auto response said a response within 00_hours and still no reply .
0	i put a read receipt on and a person called kayko ( or something like that read it and clearly just ignored it !
0	i have spoken to many people and this too has happened to them !
0	watch out as you won ’_t get what they offer you because apparently it will be damaged !
0	take photos of phone before sending to any phone place !
0	very good , had a problem which was immediately solved .
0	used partyrama a few_times & always had excellent service & superfast delivery .
0	i recommend them to all my contacts , i '_m a children '_s entertainer , & have heard_nothing but good feedback from them too .
0	out of all the places on the internet that i '_ve ordered from , truffleshuffle is possibly the best .
0	the products look great and are well - made .
0	the speed of delivery is second to none and the fact that they give you sweets with your delivery is just the cherry on top .
0	truffleshuffle ftw !
0	i was kept_informed at every_stage of process
0	quick sending of envelope and final cheque
0	got a good price for item , reflective of age and condition
0	would reccomend !!
0	!
0	easy to use website , fantastic communication , quick delivery and most of all the final product was amazing .
0	cant_wait to use them again
0	best things ever !
0	what a laugh for adults and kids !
0	great deal and friendly customer service working round us customers !
0	highly_recommended
0	been with various phone companies but o0 is one of the best ive been with deals are very good and its very cheap .
0	would recommend .
0	hardly disspointed when i go in store i allways manage to find something i like .
0	baby clothes have very off sizes i brought a ' dress ' sized 00 - 00months to put away .
0	my daughter had one wear out of it at 0months old - as a top !
0	wouldn_'_t recommend for baby clothes .
0	ordered a dress online .
0	it was delivered late first of all and once opened it look nothing like it did online .
0	i ordered a it a size larger and it was still hard to get on and off and was very short .
0	size '_s are not very accurate at all .
0	colours and design allways look different .
0	not very good quality for the price .
0	good item '_s all look very modern .
0	some are very overpriced but for soft_furnishings very good value .
0	seem to stock alot better products in the usa then the uk which can be fustrating as your never able to get_hold of them .
0	ordered a new bank card as mine snapped recieved it 0_days_later in the post was awaiting a new pin to come which never did after ringing them i found out i wouldn_'_t recieve a new one .
0	which was fine just wished they would have told be before hand .
0	very hard to understand anyone as they seem to be located everywhere but england !
0	still have not be able to sort_out an issue with the ammount i caan withdraw per day either .
0	been ' sent ' out forms that have never arrived .
0	excellent food .
0	like the fact there is no service as your just left in peace .
0	chicken is always cooked to perfection !
0	did find the menu '_s hard to follow the first time i went but overall good value good food and nice relaxed meals .
0	went to buy last_minuite party bits .
0	prices are all reasonable and not a bit of food left by the end of the night compared to stuff i had brought elsewhere !
0	left security_tag on the side of case which caused the case to be unable to open had to return to store 0miles away to have them remove the tag only to be told that next time i should check before leaving the store like it was my job to do !
0	i find they are allways helpful when i go instore .
0	i ordered my travel_system from them and it arrived on time and all in one parcel which i was happy about as the pushchair was very large .
0	i have experienced a couple of problems with the travel_system but as it was brought while 0_months pregnant the are saying ' general issues due to use ' allthough its only been in use for 0_months .
0	as i said though the staff are very different in store and can '_t do enough to help you .
0	ordered some xmas_presents online .
0	the arrived late and allthough i was in the delivery driver left the package with a neighbour and just posted the ' i called but you were not in card through '.
0	this has happened on two occasions .
0	and very overpriced !
0	0 small items for a 0month_old .. over_£_00 !
0	i recently brought a new mircowave from a curry '_s store .
0	the staff were absolutely awful !
0	i was sent all over the place to loctae this microwave and they didn_'_t seem to care once the payment was allready made .
0	i ended_up in the store room at one point !
0	when someone finally took any notice of the issue and located the microwave after 00 minuites being in store , i was given the wrong one for less value !
0	i went back in once i had noticed the error and asked for a full_refund which in turn caused more issues .
0	i had to wait in a lenghty queue to even get any advice .
0	i would never go back there again .
0	placed an order with bhs direct online for a limited_edition stroller from cosatto .
0	found the stroller itself alot_cheaper in other stores but decided to pay the extra to go with a store recognised .
0	i paid £_000 for the stroller on the 00 / 00 / 00 satisfied that the order would arrive withing the 0 - 0working_days as promised after the order was placed and paid for bhs then decided to email me stating that the 0 - 0_days wasn_'_t going to be the case at all !
0	i recieved several emails from them about a number of issues to do with stock , items coming seperately etc .
0	so annoyed have been unable to go_anywhere on the off chance a delievery is made and i miss it .
0	which i will then have to pay £_00 for re - delievery .
0	earliest im going to recieve the order now is the 00th ..
0	yet ive been getting emails stating .. ' item '_s dispatched in full ' for 0_days running now !
0	costomer service is awful .
0	the emessage system is completely terrible and doesn_'_t work as it should .
0	disgusting service .
0	rude , sarcastic , manager aggressive towards me because shop_assistants chose to bend rules - not my idea .
0	complete refusal to deal with issue because i bought the printer from a different store .
0	advised that i needed to resolve the issue with the store i bought the printer from ie .
0	return it to the isle of wight - a 0 hour journey including ferry costs far_greater than cost of a new printer .
0	that was only the tip of the iceburg .
0	been using this website to book all the hostels for a trip around america .
0	it '_s so easy to use , particularly love the map_feature so you can choose based on location .
0	being_able to see reviews so easily as well and have them broken down by categories like location , facilities is really handy
0	absolutely fantastic , never fault them , they always get the order right , always quick prompt delivery , i give them five_stars because they are worth them !
0	i purchased a few products one which was a fake_tan mit and i did not realise it was only a face one as it didnt state it clearly and it was around 0 / 0 pounds and they are only € 0 to buy in shops for the big ones , i wasn_'_t happy with thatc
0	staying here was easy and very comfortable .
0	i stayed in a double deluxe room .
0	it had everything i needed and more .
0	the bed was huge and i had a really good sleep .
0	breakfast the next_morning was great :) the hotel is just a 0 minute_walk from east ham station :)
0	no_complaints here , i '_d stay again
0	from_start to end the service was quick and easy very fast pick_up , parcels undamaged and arrived quickly .
0	the online booking_system was easy to understand and quick to use , would be my method of choice now .
0	even the emails from peter at the reviews team were polite and seemed to genuinely want to check everything happened at the highest_standard possible .
0	absolutely love my uglies baselayer - in fact i '_m considering buying more !
0	the site is easy to use and understand , i like the traffic light system for stock_availability .
0	would definitely order from barrington_sports again .
0	i did days and days of research_into the best value bike for money and could not beat pauls cycles .
0	the price was hundreds lower_than elsewhere and delivery was hassle_free .
0	will certainly use again .
0	this " company " first contacted me claiming to be " calling from facebook " - not sure if that is even legal !
0	we were guaranteed a return on investment , 0 , 000 instant facebook_page " likes " and an advertising campaign where we could set our own demographics ( age , gender , etc ).
0	we returned nothing - zero , never received the full 0 , 000 likes ( received around 000 overall - mainly from people outside europe or who do not really exist - with fake profiles ).
0	we were also not allowed to set demographics ( being advised that they '_d know better - so we trusted to leave them to it ).
0	the advert that they put on facebook was the size of a thumbnail and almost laughable .
0	when sold the " service " we were informed that the price included vat ( assuming that means it '_s effectively 00_% cheaper since we can reclaim the vat ) - but it turns_out they are not even vat registered !
0	emails and calls are never returned .
0	we should have received a follow_up on the campaign 00 days into it - which never happened .
0	the only interest we received from new mount media was them up - selling - by trying to sell their website design services ( a ploy to let you believe that '_s why the marketing_campaign isn_'_t working ).
0	they managed to take an extra £_00 from us by doubling our advert from 00 , 000 to 000 , 000 - but never received an invoice - which we '_ve asked for several_times .
0	we were also supposed to receive performance reports for our campaign on day 00 - these were not received so we have no evidence that they even did the campaign which we paid for !
0	when expressing our concern about the marketing_campaign they patronisingly point - blank denied all the promised services but said they '_d look into it and improve the last few_days left of the campaign ....
0	but they did nothing .
0	we even cancelled our company debit_card to avoid any further charges .
0	save your money or go to an established , honest company .
0	i will update this review it the situation improves or worsens .
0	funky_pigeon lure you into a false sense of security by stating " royal_mail claim 00_% of first_class parcels are delivered the next_day " and then mention that we must allow up to working 0_days for delivery for first_class .
0	so you think " yeah , i '_ll risk it since it '_s 00_% likely to arrive on time ".
0	but it never does .
0	my " first_class " deliveries have always taken 0 - 0 working_days .
0	i have my own company and know for a fact first_class arrives next_day and only around one in 000 of my parcels ever arrives late ( so really there should be a 00 . 0 % chance it would arrive the next_day ) the truth : they ship them from out of the uk ( to save taxes ) hence the rubbish postal service .
0	they need to be more honest and stop leading people on .
0	it '_s false_advertising .
0	ordered a tambour office cupboard .
0	i took everything out of the packaging - only to find no instructions .
0	so further time wasted messing_around putting it all away ( as it was the evening so i couldn_'_t get instructions ).
0	i emailed them to confirm the instructions were missing .
0	i received the instructions via_email and printed them off .
0	again , i took everything out of the packaging only to find incorrect instructions !
0	so , again , messed_around putting everything back away .
0	emailed them again - monday 00th of jan .
0	it '_s now the 0nd of feb .
0	guess_what ?
0	no reply and no instructions .
0	i '_ve had to pay a joiner to put the unit together ( as with his experience he could work out where everything goes ).
0	i '_ll never order from this company again as they '_ve caused me unnecessary cost and time wasting .
0	you can return your order for free ( not always if you do not buy direct from amazon ).
0	customer service replies almost straight_away .
0	prices are often the lowest on the internet .
0	free delivery on all amazon fulfilled orders .
0	there really is nothing_negative to say .
0	apart_from the odd delivery let - down - but usually that '_s the delivery company '_s fault .
0	the good : yes , prices are often the best on the net - but is it worth the hassle , slow delivery and lack of customer service ...?
0	i have used zavvi many_times since they started up and have only had one order that was satisfactory .
0	they do not get pre orders to you on the day of release unless you pay a premium delivery rate .
0	customer service is shockingly_bad - you have to contact them as many as four times until you get a reply .
0	my most_recent transaction resulted_in a paypal_dispute as they did not refund me for a returned item and ignored my emails .
0	as soon as you raise it with paypal , zavvi manage to respond instantly !
0	( perhaps they do not want to lose the paypal payment facility costing them valuable sales ?).
0	so unprofessional .
0	because of this , i recommend you pay by paypal incase they mess you around like they did with me ....
0	there have also been many occasions where zavvi take your order to later on state item is not in stock ( they don_'_t tell you by email , you have to log_into your account to chase it up - and see it in your order history ).
0	they would happily leave it a year and not tell you when you could have ordered the item elsewhere in the meantime .
0	it is really not worth ordering from zavvi for the sake of saving a quid or two as the many minutes ( and sometimes even hours ) of time wasting involved in chasing it up is not worth it !
0	this is the second time over the last few_years great magazines has let_me down .
0	my recent problem was ordering 00 months fhm subscription with free aftershave .
0	i '_ve contacted them 0 times since ordering chasing up my free gift ( it '_s now been nearly 00 weeks ).
0	i had had a few delivery dates promised to me (" allow up to x amount of days " etc ) and all those times have passed .... as far as i '_m concerned they make promises they cannot keep and the customer service staff are generally liars !
0	update_: i have since received an_email_stating there is a delay with stock - thus confirming all previous emails from other employees were complete lies !!!
0	i think this may be delay tactics so that it '_s too late to dispute with my credit_card .
0	never again .
0	states free shipping on website - but they charged me over_£ 0 .
0	then marked my order as shipped .
0	didn_'_t receive , so emailed them .
0	then i was told they have a stock issue and had to refund me .
0	very shady .
0	avoid !
0	easy to purchase itunes giftcards that are always cheaper_than the high_street .
0	can be downloaded directly from your account or by the link provided .
0	very reliable !!
0	!
0	amount received as quoted .
0	my only_complaint is that you have to pay to send phone but still better value than selling it somewhere_else .
0	also kept_updated on status of payment etc .
0	recommended .
0	easy to order , has options for buy now , pay later or pay in instalments - choices to suit every pocket !
0	huge choice of goods , great value for money .
0	hostelbookers was a great place to start looking for my hostel for new_york .
0	i wanted to save as much money as possible for when i '_m actually there and not splurge on accomodation but was also quite keen to not be miles_away from all the attractions . i found hostelbookers to be cheaper_than other_websites and found the map_view quite helpful - being_able to see how long it would take to get from the hostel to everything i wanted to visit was a great help !
0	in terms of the actual booking once i had found my hostel it was really fast and straightforward !
0	a few issues in the past with delivery but has_improved just need to insure when sending large logs the boxes are strong_enough to hold the weight
0	emma , was wonderful .
0	i didnt know my way around the site and she sorted my quote for me and then went on to help me organise everything and i just had to click the link cornfirm and pay .
0	she did her job and hope the company can follow_up and get my parcel to its_destination .
0	thanks emma !
0	!
0	i was thankfully referred to supplement_warehouse in the last_year and it has_been an oasis in the desert of expensive and non catering supplement sites flooding the internet .
0	their prices are the lowest and if their not they will match and lower any sites prices by 0 % i mean is that real ... yes it is !
0	!... their shipping is ultra fast and 0_days a week if you dont give this website a chance youre doing yourself and your wallet and disservice .
0	easy site to use , good prices , excellent clothes .
0	will be coming_back time after time after time
0	great product , fast delivery , will definitely use again
0	excellent experience of using speckyfoureyes . com at the start of december .
0	i '_d been needing an extra pair of glasses for a while ( i don_'_t like to only have 0 pair due to breaking them in the past and being left blind as a bat in the process !
0	makes me nervous ).
0	i didn_'_t want to settle for a very cheap pair of glasses from the high_street , i '_ve been meaning to get a rimless pair the last few_times but have always been put off by the price .
0	in the end i was able to get a rimless pair of specs for my prescription for literally a third of the price of the cheapest rimless pairs i '_ve been trying on in shops .
0	i would definitely use their service again .
0	i '_m actually surprised my glasses arrived so soon due to the christmas delivery backlogs that always hit at this time of year , but i ordered on the 0th_december and i had them on the 00th .
0	excellent !
0	!
0	i live in america and my mom lives in england .
0	i am never able to have flowers delivered to her due to the high prices i am usually presented with online .
0	i '_m really glad i found this place !!
0	i was able to send her a very nice bouquet of chrysanthemums and chocolates for an extremely reasonable_price , with free shipping !
0	she was overjoyed with them and said they were lovely .
0	i used the chat customer service twice , and while i can '_t remember the names of those who helped_me they were very efficient .
0	i also liked the fact that they emailed me to notify_me that the flowers had been delivered .
0	thank_you , i will definitely be using your services again !
0	i am a regular customer at vio_vets - their service is alway prompt / friendly / helpful
0	i would recommend them to every pet_owner i meet .
0	no . 0 site for your pets
0	thankyou
0	vio_vets
0	i love it to send 000 chars to my followers .
0	great invention .

0	its d best social networkin tool , i found my many frnds here .
0	i love google apps
0	came to know abt protector thru one of my friend n was amazed to see performance .
0	had a problem aftr installation n contacted live support , issues were handld quickly .
0	wil strongly_recommend to all my frnds n colleagues .
0	i purchased some flowers from serenata for mother '_s day and paid premium for sunday delivery .
0	the flowers were delivered by yodel - it wasn_'_t mentioned when ordering that flowers would be sent by courier so the delivery experience wasn_'_t as special .
0	when my mother opened the box , the flowers were on their side and looking really limp and fragile .
0	the pot with some wadding in was bone dry and it seemed as though the flowers had been in the box for some time .
0	when paying so much this is not acceptable .
0	i wouldn_'_t use serenata_flowers again .
0	we have just returned from our_wedding in cyprus and used silk_blooms to purchase our flowers .
0	the service we received from the beginning has_been fabulous , mara would do anything to help you ( i kept adding on bits and bobs up to the last_minute ) and nothing was a hassle for her .
0	our flowers travelled perfectly to cyprus and back to scotland .
0	i would use silk_blooms again and would thoroughly_recommend them to anyone !
0	i have ordered roman_blinds from this company .
0	the blinds are great quality and their customer service is also highly valued .
0	after ordering online i changed my mind and wanted a different colour and they changed it for me which was very nice .
0	all in all i highly_recommend this company if you want to buy quality blinds .
0	fast delivery service but when i received the game it did not come with any cellophane_wrapping or promotional leaflets usually put in ps0_games , prompting me to think these games may infact be second_hand .
0	just a quick message to thank one of your employees who i spoke to over the phone today at 00 . 00pm called rup .
0	he was absolutely fantastic and was a real_pleasure to talk to !
0	he was kind , thoughtful and could very easily put himself into the shoes of the customer - i felt very comfortable dealing_with him .
0	he informed me that i could go down to a £_00 a month_contract ( saving me £ 0 a month !)
0	and even added on 000 extra minutes for me for the first 0_months - for free !
0	to help me with the transition of going down to a smaller tarrif .
0	he let_me know that i have 0 magic_numbers to add on to my account and also answered all my questions about splitting my account .
0	very helpful , knowledgable and a real credit to the company !
0	so thanks very much rup !
0	hope to deal with more people like you in call_centres in the future .
0	kindest_regards ,
0	one very happy customer
0	it is my cousins wedding on friday but i work every weekday so i decided to order from missguided . co . uk as it is so convinient and there are some lovely and inexpensive dresses .
0	i spent roughly 0 - 0 hours on tuesday on the website and eventually found a dress that i loved !
0	i added the dress to my basket only to find when i entered the basket it had suddenly vanished ?
0	i continued to try to add it to the basket but it just kept disappearing .
0	after about 00_minutes i could no_longer view the particular dress on the website at all in no way whatsoever !
0	it was as if the dress had vanished off the face of the website !
0	i then managed to find the dress and add it in a smaller_size but was worried it wouldn_'_t fit so ordered two other dress aswell in the hope that one would be suitable .
0	i also ordered a pair of shoes , this came to over_£_000 .
0	i sent a message to missguided expressing my disappointment .
0	i also included a message on the delivery asking for a size 00 if possible .
0	then , i opened the website later that evening to show my boyfriend the 0 dresses , another different dress had vanished off the face of the website but the one i loved had suddenly reappeared .
0	out of curiosity i tried to add it to my basket in a size 00 and voila !
0	it worked !
0	i was astounded but also very annoyed at the same time .
0	i knew that to ensure this dress would fit i needed it in a size 00 so i decided to order it again and figured i would just send the size 00 back for a refund .
0	however , i wanted the free next_day delivery so it would all arrive together .
0	so , i also ordered a blouse and this order came to over_£_00 .
0	that is over_£_000 in all .
0	i sent another message to missguided expressing my extreme frustration of being ignored and how annoyed i was that all of a sudden the dress is back on the website and available to order in my size .
0	this is where i am livid .
0	i started work today ( thursday ) at 0 o_clock and my dad was in the house all day and nobody came , the doorbell wasn_'_t rung and the door wasn_'_t knocked .
0	i got home from work at around 0pm to find a dx delivery card through the door saying the 0 parcels were " at top of stairs " - as there is a fire_escape outside of my front_door .
0	ummmm there is no parcel in my supposed " safe_place ".
0	i have checked on the stairs , with my neighbours , the vicinity of my porch , everywhere and there is nothing to be found .
0	i can only_assume the courier has misplaced the parcel or it has in fact been stolen through no fault of my own .
0	there was no time written on the card , no other details were provided and i wasn_'_t even aware i even had a safe_place ?
0	i assumed i would have to sign for the two parcels if i was not in but somebody was in all day !
0	now , i have to take a day off work tomorrow to go into_town and buy a dress for my cousins wedding on friday .
0	i am £_000 out of pocket .
0	looking at all these reviews i do have to wonder ... will i ever get my refund ?
0	i doubt it .
0	never order from this company ..
0	i know i won_'_t make that mistake again !
0	i am one extremely unhappy customer to the point of crying .
0	thanks alot missguided .
0	:(
0	and if you do read this lisa harris , i will be writing to trading_standards about this and will not_hesitate to contact bbc_watchdog which i '_m_sure a lot of your unsatisfied customers would be happy to write too aswell .
0	the service was a * from beginning to end .
0	will be using them again and would recommend to everyone .
0	terrible , i have been made to wait in for deliveries that never arrive , then they are cancelled then turn_up .
0	i then have to wait in for yodel to come and collect and wait in for booked collections for them to not arrive .
0	glad to not be holding my breath .
0	finally collected .
0	yet i have had to do all the chasing spending god_knows_how many hours on the phone to these idiots who are absolutely no help .
0	get told in emails i have to phone to rebook , and they don_'_t reimburse disgruntled_customers when they have wasted much of their precious time through their own stupid faults .
0	i will never ever again order something from very or any other associated catalogues they have .
0	really wouldn_'_t shop_here if you paid me millions , not worth the hassle , time or stress dealing_with a bunch of ....
0	totally_unacceptable and guess_what they couldn_'_t care less !
0	great website at great prices .
0	will certainly use them again and recommend to others !
0	i '_ve_used nature '_s best 0 times and every transaction has_been seamless .
0	they have great products and offer good value for money and prompt delivery .
0	my orders are shipped abroad to eastern europe and they still arrive in good time .
0	can '_t fault them .
0	wish all internet companies were this good .
0	a very similar experience to everyone else .
0	was offered one price on the internet , which was then reduced due to ' wear and tear '.
0	my payment was ' processed ' on may 00th but i still_haven_'_t received it .
0	it '_s now 00 working_days since processing began , much longer_than the 0 to 00 days they guarantee .
0	there must be a financial gain for them to hold on to our money as long as they possibly can .
0	communication is dire and i get the same generic email every time i chase .
0	this company is appalling .
0	my sister used mazuma_mobile and had a fantastic experience , i wish i '_d done the same .
0	i have never been one to successfully stay on a ' diet ' but now i wouldn_'_t change it for the world .
0	popping across to the group for support is such a valuable part of my day , i would miss not being part of it .
0	i feel like i have made friends with everyone in the group .
0	the ordering process is easy and all staff are quick to deal with queries ( but i never really have them ) love it x
0	easy to order , arrived quickly and exactly_what my furry_friend needed .
0	i will definitely be back .
0	thank_you
0	ordered a bouquet of roses , lilys and sunflowers for my mum on mothers_day , selected the delivery date of mothers_day .
0	recieved email the day before mothers_day stating they would be delivered today ?!
0	this was obviously not what i wanted so i contacted them ( have not yet recieved a reply to the first contact i made ).
0	saturday_morning the flowers arrived at my mums house , mothers_day she opened them .
0	what had arrived was a disgusting bunch of yellow and white carnations !!
0	!
0	now everyone_knows that carnations are probably the cheapest flowers available .
0	i used to work in a florist and so know this too well !
0	my mum hates carnations !
0	so do i and had i known this is what would be classed_as the subsitute for a bunch of gorgeous roses , lillys and sunflowers .
0	i would never had ordered in the first place !!
0	!
0	i contacted i florist on mothers_day to voice my disgust ... 0_days_later no reply ... contacted them again saying i have now sent two emails and recieved no reply .... no reply for another 0_days !
0	contacted them again ... no reply !
0	finally after two_weeks i recieved a generated message which must be sent to all saying they are sorry and value customer feedback ( which they dont ) i replied to this message again saying how i am not happy both with the deleivery date , the flowers , their service , basically everything about them !
0	didnt receive a reply for another couple of days !
0	then finally i am offered " a maximum gesture of £ 0 . 00 voucher " which is obviously no use to me as i will not ever use them again !
0	i am still in the process of actually recieving a reply that is from a real_person ... looking exactly at my case and not just copying and pasting their ready made responses to complaints !
0	i sent pictures of the flowers i had received but this has not been mentioned at all .
0	the proof is there , just wish i could upload the pictures on here somehow to show you all .
0	please do not use them - they will ruin whatever occassion you are sending them for and then do not even bother to reply to your complaint unless you do all the chasing .
0	there are so many other genuine and caring florists available with great prices that wont let you down ... use them not iflorist !
0	great products , great prices , great service - what more is there to say ?
0	very quick transaction , the whole_process , from booking the order online , to receiving the money in my bank took about 0_days !
0	very impressed , i wish i had more old_phones to sell !
0	most of the time my items have arrived so quickly i couldnt_believe it !
0	one time it took a while and i doubted it would come but it did .
0	be careful who you are buying off and pick somebody with good credibility and you should be fine .
0	great for selling too and your items get lots of attention .
0	excellent service , got the money very quickly and got the amount my phones were valued at .
0	was very pleased i was able to make money from my broken phones !
0	i searched for the best site to find hostels at , and i am glad i went with hostelbooker !
0	there was no booking_fee , and i was pleasantly_surprised to see how cheap the hostels were ; i thought it would be significantly more_expensive .
0	it '_s a big weight off my shoulders to know that i '_ll have somewhere to stay when i land in germany !
0	my kiddies love coming to funky_rabbit to play upstairs and to the cookery and craft_club :-) my son used to hate having his feet measured and trying on shoes but funky_rabbit were friendly , helpful and reassuring to the children - and now he_loves it :-)
0	definitely recommend it to all - go and see for yourself :-)
0	i was really happy with mazuma as it was all done so quick and easy and its exactly how its advertised so have no_complaints and completely_satisfied
0	i was really happy the way one of the staff booked my tickets . he was really helpful , kind and very professional .
0	its actually the second time i '_m booking my ticket with the same staff and i could '_t be more happy with the excellent service provided ,. definitely i will be booking with travel house uk in the near_future and i will recommend to friends and family .
0	thanks so much for all your help .
0	i have ordered from here multiple_times .
0	my items have come on time and in proper condition .
0	best price on the web at the time .
0	despatched quickly .
0	well_packaged .
0	would recommend .
0	this is the second time i have used ao . com to purchase a large appliance and it won_'_t be the last .
0	excellent customer service and unbeatable prices .
0	was able to choose a delivery day that suited me .
0	was given a 0 hour_slot so i didn_'_t have to hang_around the house all day .
0	delivery guys were friendly .
0	would highly_recommend !
0	great prices , easy to navigate website & fast response .
0	the only problem is that the packages sent out for delivery are sometimes too small .
0	the same size of package is sent out for six phones as well as ten phones .
0	it can be a tight squeeze sometimes .
0	i used the stag and hen for my sisters_hen_do , we decided to go budapest on weekend of 00 june .
0	the experience from_start to finish was absolutely superb - i dealt_with michael throughout and he could not have been more accommodating .
0	from planning the whole trip for us and anticipating_any changes we wanted to make .
0	the activities were brilliant - value for money was great !
0	they really thought of everything !
0	i will definitely be recommending this company and i could not be_happier with the service i received .
0	i cannot thank michael and the team enough !
0	!
0	bought a bottle of blue label for my boyfriend - and opted to get it engraved !
0	delivery was quick and efficient and the engraving turned_out brilliant !
0	great rc site , so many products and excellent delivery .
0	always on hand to answer any_questions or gift advice for my other half .
0	would recommend them over many other online companies .
0	like many people on here , i ordered mother '_s day flowers for delivery to france last_week .
0	despite_numerous_calls and reassurances , no flowers were ever delivered .
0	they are now " looking into it ".
0	i have asked for a refund - according to my consumer_rights , if a delivery date was agreed ( which is was ) and the goods have not arrived by that date , that is a breach of contract and you can request your money back .
0	i have been told someone will call me back in the next three_days !
0	i have reported this company to watchdog and would advise any other uk citizens to do the same .
0	they cannot be allowed to get away with this awful service !
0	ps you will notice after how every bad_review there are a flurry of 0_star ones , all sounding quite alike !
0	apparently iflorist have already been investigated for posting their own excellent reviews .
0	this website was easy to search for the kind of hostel i wanted .
0	i could choose the area , the type of room , or by price .
0	sorting by ratings worked really well because lots of past customers have left helpful reviews about the hostel .
0	i felt i was getting a good price for a place i trusted because of what other people have said .
0	had a problem with my glasses and when i contacted customer_services they were less_than helpful .
0	i wouldnt recommend them to anyone i know .
0	since i booked my group booking it has_been nothing but problems with their staff ignoring emails to the point where people booked elsewhere instead of going with us .
0	we got transferred to a " manager " that also ignored our emails and still we are getting daily phone_calls demanding " outstanding money " that isnt outstanding and being told we will loose our booking and all our money if we dont pay up the imaginary money due .
0	every time i ask to talk to management i get fobbed_off onto another " manager " that can barely_speak_english and doesn_'_t answer any_questions or sort_out the problem .
0	never ever book with this company
0	i can '_t say anything bad about this company .
0	hilda is a credit to the company and has_been fantastic throughout the whole_process .
0	they are very efficient and fast .
0	i really can '_t fault them .
0	i would definitely recommend them to anyone .
0	truely fantastic .
0	thank_you so very much .

0	north_wales
0	highly_recommended company , will definitely use again !
0	i have shopped with this company a few_times_now , and i have never been disappointed .
0	their products are excellent quality , and their delivery service is the best around !
0	i ordered late_afternoon , my item arrived next_morning .
0	great service , i can recommend to everyone !!

0	i needed to buy a new_washing_machine as mine had broken .
0	as i have 0 children under the age of 0 , i thought i would ring and see if the one i wanted was in stock and the earliest delivery date .
0	the girl i spoke to said to book it online for the soonest available date ( over a week away ) and she would move the date forward for me .
0	i did this but unfortunately my washer did not arrive .
0	it was 0pm so i thought i would call and ask if it had been dispatched .
0	there had been a mix_up with the paper_work .
0	matthew , the customer service guy , offered me a refund straight_away .
0	he explained the refund could take up to 0 working_days or i could wait untill the online delivery date for my machine to be delivered .
0	i explained that i didn_'_t want a refund but was there any way it could be delivered sooner as i was drowning in dirty laundry with 0 small children .
0	he said he would call me back in a few_moments .
0	to be honest , i didn_'_t expect him to .
0	i was very pleased and suprised when he called within 00_minutes .
0	they would send my washer by courier for delivery and it arrived within 0 working_days .
0	everyone makes_mistakes .
0	some companies don_'_t seem to want to fix theirs but beyondtelivision . co . uk went out of their way to ensure i had my washer and fix their error .
0	from the first time to the last time i spoke to them , they were friendly , polite , professional and most of all they apologised .
0	not many companies do that nowadays .
0	despite their delivery mix_up , i would definately_reccomend them to anyone .
0	the service was brilliant and my washer was cheap .
0	i paid £_000 with free delivery too !
0	!, its on sale at currys for £_000 .
0	lg f0000td , go to google shopping and check it out .
0	i '_m a very happy lady .
0	in these tough times every_penny counts !
0	thank_you beyondtelevision and thank_you to matthew .
0	i ordered a nania cosmo sp carseat with them , it arrived very poorly packaged , without paperwork and without working harness buckle alarm .
0	poor communication afterwards , had to send them the same email over and over again , unwilling to offer a swap in_spite of having plenty of the same carseats in stock when i notified them of the fault , and their phonelines are constantly_engaged .
0	the hassle is not worth the cheaper prices !
0	after having major issues unlocking my iphone 0 ( that was locked to 0 who refused to unlock it ) i went_ahead and used this company fast simple and reliable and will definitely .
0	recommend to anyone who needs there iphone_unlocked .
0	hostelbookers is much_better_than other budget accommodation resources ( no need to mention names ) because a . the website is more user_friendly and b . it '_s cheaper .
0	i have used it for years without_any_problems and have recommended it to my friends over and over again !
0	produtcs are not the best quality , but they ' re not very expensive either , so you do get what you pay for .
0	customer service is excellent .
0	i '_ve never had any_problems with boohoo .
0	great gift .
0	delivery was very fast .
0	i did not know how good the image would be , but it was excellent .
0	would definately recomend to anyone .
0	absolutly stunning perfume - got an extra disount on 000ml smells gorgeous great for day or night - gets some great comments
0	got a stunning lec fridge_freezer delivered .
0	marks_electrical let_me no exactly when delivery would be , i recieved conformation of delivery time the day before so could still plan to go out .
0	the driver called to let_me no he was 00_mins_away and was very friendly .
0	cant_fault this service is second to none .
0	wow !
0	everything is organised and i was very impressed .
0	thanks so much for a hassle_free shop that i will be reccommending and will_definatly be using again .
0	thanks guys
0	this is the easiest_way to book accommodation anywhere in the world .

0	i received a tin vase worth less_than £ 0 when i was meant to receive a vase that i paid £_00 . 00 for with my purchase of flowers .
0	i contacted the complaints centre and offered to return this vase as it was clearly worth less_than was advertised .
0	however all i received were some cut and paste replies from the company that completely denied any wrong doing .
0	i '_ve sent three responses to this email over a period of three_weeks and have received no reply from them at all - what horrendous customer service .
0	i shall now be reporting them to the office of fair_trading for misleading marketing .
0	absolutely deceitful and awful company - do not use !
0	i have been a customer of t - mobile for about a year , i have never had any_problems to contact them about , so really no no_issues at all for a while .
0	until i made the horrific mistake of getting my boyfriend involved in a contract with t - mobile .
0	my problem with t - mobile has escalated for so long , that it is hard to even talk about it without feeling extremely frustrated .
0	all i really want to say , is that if you ever have an issue with t - mobile please do not expect to get any type of customer service from them .
0	0 ) they obviously have no interest at all in looking after their customers , new or existing , because they simply do not train their staff sufficiently to deal with issues correctly , at the very least to give you the right information .
0	0 ) even when they have made an_error and they know it they will promise to fix things but this sadly never happens .
0	to the point that after 00th complaint to fix subsequent problems that have risen from their lack of training and their customer_services complete ineptitude to deal with even the simplest requests , you still have solved nothing .
0	0 ) you then try to speak to someone higher up after you have exhausted all other avenues .
0	only to find that even this is not possible .
0	to finalize t - mobile have cost me and boyfriend a huge_amount of money , time and energy , they have driven me to rage , and still the problem is not fixed after nearly a month of calls .
0	after the many issues with just receiving the handset , my boyfriend never received his phone in the end , and he explained to t - mobile that he did not want to use t - mobile because they had let him down before even he had started his contract with them , and they still had the cheek to ask for a cancellation charge , and debited his account with his monthly charge .
0	i have never written a review about any company , however the experience i have had with t - mobile has_been so bad i just had to share it .
0	i very much doubt t - mobile will do anything about this .
0	i really do not think they care as long as they are making money !!
0	!
0	that '_s the impression i get !
0	very sad !
0	i have used wonga on occasion and never had a problem , until recently that is !
0	i had a loan and my circumstances_changed so i called and arranged a payment plan , i stuck to it and decided to pay it off early as my situation had improved , cue the trouble !!!!
0	wonga charged me £_00 . 00 over what was due , then when i rang to request a refund , was told she would send it to their investigation team but can '_t guarantee it !
0	i explained that was fine as i had proof so if my money wasn_'_t returned i would contact the appropriate services , got told to call back in 00_hrs .
0	when i called back , i got fed some rubbish about how things don_'_t work the same at weekends the processes are slower , which i told them was not acceptable as they had taken my money fast enough so i wanted it sorted , got asked to call back in 00_hrs , did that and was told i could have a refund but it would take 0 - 0 working_days to get to my account !
0	again , explained that they clearly have the ability to send fast payments as they do for their loans but was banging my head against a wall and had to just wait , at_least my account was clear ???
0	when i finally received the refund , i decided to check my account for some reason , luckily i did as the cheeky sods had put the money they had refunded me , due to taking money they shouldn_'_t have , back onto my account with a message_saying ' we are disappointed you haven_'_t kept to your payment plan , your account is in arrears of £_00 . 00 !!!!!!!!
0	again called and complained , got through to a very helpful man who understood and said he would sort it and my account would be rectified in ' 00_hrs ' i explained that i thank him for his help but this is ridiculous as it '_s my credit_rating getting affected !
0	00_hrs_later still not been done , if i hadn_'_t of checked i wouldn_'_t have known , their balls up yet i have to ' wait 00_hrs ' every time i call !!!!
0	i wonder_if they would ' wait 00_hrs ' if i didn_'_t pay and they called me to be told ' things don_'_t work the same on the weekend the processes are slower ?'
0	it can take a lifetime to build a good reputation , but only seconds to ruin it , well_done wonga , with your attempts at sly money taking , refunds that get put back onto peoples accounts , and your standard ' 00 hour wait between phone_calls , i think yours has well and truly been smashed to pieces !
0	and as for ' historic miscalculations ' and ' people overpaying by no more than £ 0 ' as stated in your press statement , where i come from , £_00 . 00 is much more than £ 0 and i wouldn_'_t class last_week as historic !!!
0	total_joke !
0	i ordered some hay_fever tablets ( 0yrs supply for £ 0 . 00 ) after being alerted to the deal by a hot deal app .
0	i had never used this company before but can_honestly_say i will definitely be using it from now on !
0	the prices are fabulous and the service is absolutely_brilliant .
0	the check out process was simple , i was emailed to let_me know my order had been accepted , and again when it had been processed and dispatched .
0	the order was in my hand within 0 working_days and it was exactly_what i ordered .
0	not often nowadays you have companies that are easy to use , sell things at a great price , send you the correct order , after keeping you fully_updated with what '_s happening ( ie processed - dispatched ) and i could honestly give 000_% to !
0	thank_you very much , i will be back again soon :-)
0	this company is brilliant , the app is easy to use and it '_s fairly_priced with a wide_range of cards etc to choose from .
0	has never let_me down and i have ordered lots off here , a lifesaver for when i remember a birthday in a few_days !!!
0	would recommend them to anyone great product and service
0	had to stop using my catalogue company as after 0 years of using then with not a single fault they have changed their delivery company to hermes .
0	from my first order after the change i have had nothing but grief parcels never turn_up , get told the neighbours have them , ' lewis at number 0 ' apparently , surprise_surprise no lewis at number 0 and definately no parcel , other parcels have ended_up in this magic place the couriers ' deliver ' them to , obviously their homes as i don_'_t ever receive sod all when this company is involved , so after proving i haven_'_t received sod all i have got my money back and will not be using my catalogue or hermes again , shame really as my catalogue is a bloody good company but ruining their reputation working with hermes - ps would have been no stars but wouldn_'_t let_me !

0	i was looking to purchase some life_insurance for myself and didn_'_t know where to start i emailed protect line and they rang me straight back and arranged a convenient time to call me for a longer chat .
0	they called again when arranged and talked_me through the various policies and covers available on an information only basis so no hard_sell and nothing signed upto in the call .
0	when i decided which one i wanted protect line done everything for me and kept me informed every_step of the way , they also helped_me arrange trustees and beneficiaries regarding my life_insurance etc so i could say exactly who my money went to and how much , should the worse happen !
0	i have had contact numbers that are answered very quickly ( 0 - 0 rings ) and very politely and have been treated as an important individual throughout , not like just another customer like most companies !
0	all in all i cannot_fault this company and would recommend them to anyone !!!
0	thanks protect line
0	ordered many items from amazon and always foudn them to deliver on time and the right good !...
0	keep_up the good work !
0	ordered a pair of snow_goggles for a last_minute skiing_trip ...
0	i was cutting it a bit fine ordering so late but the goggles arrived next_day which i was over the moon with !
0	the stockholm goggles are great and a very wide_choice of colors !
0	perfect !
0	received my new glasses yesterday , delivery took the time stated on their website so very pleased !
0	they are fantastic quality and a great style , and an amazing price !
0	most definately using them again and recommended to all my friends already !
0	i had to place my order through chat as something was not working quite right online and the staff_member who_assisted was very patient and helpful .
0	i was sending three packages from the uk to the us and was worried that one was too heavy and large .
0	this wasn_'_t a problem at all for p0g .
0	when customs got involved and required more information p0g contacted me promptly and gave_me a detailed list of what i would be needing to get my package from customs to my door .
0	all in all , it is a good service with excellent customer service and safe .
0	you can also track your order online through them or the carrier .
0	i used postagesupermarket to send 0 medium boxes from the uk to the us ( london to los_angeles .
0	the packages all arrived in 0 business days .
0	the driver / collector was very nice and helpful .
0	i had absolutely no_problems with their service and the cost for shipping was way less_than their_competitors and significantly_less_than royal_mail .
0	although this company provides cheap insurance it is obvious that the company is lacking in morals .
0	on monday_night my phone was stolen after being assaulted by a male in a nightclub .
0	after the stress of the incident i went home and went to cancel my mobile phone insurance the next_day , only to find out that this company only allows you 00_hours to do so or else your insurance is not validated .
0	i think this policy is absolutely_disgusting .
0	i am a female student living away from home and am one of the only people left here for summer , i had no phone to cancel my phone .
0	i am extremely angry that i can not have a replacement after the horrible circumstances which i had to deal with and am outraged that i have been paying £ 0 . 00 a month for effectively nothing .
0	i spoke to my mobile network_provider and they believe the 00 hour cancellation period is also rediculous as they allow 00_hours , a realistic amount of time .
0	i will be posting this message across as many forums as possible to spread the word on what a disgusting , robbing company you are .
0	i wrote an awful review about this company a while ago , but in the mean time daryl had got in touch with me , he was very apologetic and had been away and that '_s why i couldn_'_t get in touch with him .
0	he was so sorry he gave_me a full_refund and sent me out some underlay for free .
0	thanks daryl .
0	he '_s a family run business and i '_m sorry i wrote such a horrible review .
0	thanks again for solving this matter daryl .
0	i appreciate it .
0	mazuma were very quick and very reliable , i sent my phone off in the post and 0_days_later the money was in my account .

0	i recently made an order over amazon , sadly the order was directed through yodel for delivery .
0	they are terrible they posted a card through my door as i was at work when they attempted the delivery , i then rang the number to reschedule the delivery .
0	unfortunately i could not speak to anyone it was a computer operated voice who directed me to the website to reschedule at no point did i get put through to an operator .
0	i rescheduled twice waited in all day till_0pm as they can deliver upto this time it never arrived , i decided in the end to visit the depot which i managed to find online not via there website which does not even have a contact number .
0	when i arrived at the depot , they told me the website did not work and so my rescheduling would never have happened as the are not informed by the site of changes and they had sent my parcel back even_though it had not even been ten working_days .
0	they are absolutely usless and clearly not interested in customer service !!

0	i have studied with rdi for the past two years , i have no_regrets .
0	i have enough time on my hand where i will work , have fun and i still have time to study flexible , because of the 00_hrs online system , where i can log in at any time , i wish per day .
0	the prices are not just affordable but you get your monies worth .
0	my tutors supported and guided_me all the way .
0	my friends if you are looking_forward to study and your don_'_t want to leave your homeland to go campus , and you just want to study flexible at an affordable price and still do all your other activities , i recommended rdi to you .
0	the quality teaching that you receives will help you to upgrade yourself and get you a better salary .
0	rdi did it for me and it can certainly do it for you .
0	as some other reviews have said i would have given 0_stars if this was an option .
0	never have i had so many frustrations with a company !
0	i booked flights through bravofly in early march , immediatly after booking my partner found cheaper flights elsewhere .
0	in an_automated e_- mail i had received and on the reservation screen a message advised that until the flight is confirmed by the airline you can cancel .
0	i attempted to cancel as the staus clearly showed the flight was waiting confirmation , however a message appeared saying this was not possible and to contact customer service .
0	the office was closed so first thing monday_morning i called them , i spoke to a gentleman_who advised the flight would be canceled and a full_refund minus €_00 would be issued .
0	0_days_later i was still having conversations with bravofly as i hadn_'_t recieved any confirmation of a cancellation or refund .
0	fast forward 0_months and after numerous e_-_mails with screen prints of the messages i had receieved ( for some reason bravofly couldn_'_t view this in any format other than in the e_- mail text but were reluctant to let_me know this ) and an offer of a €_00 euro refund bravofly advised today that it was due to a technical_error i was unable to cancel and offering me a full_refund in the form of a voucher to use on thier website .
0	why do they think i will ever use thier company again !!
0	i requested the money be put into my account instead but for some reason yet to be explained for the refund to go into my bank_account it will only be €_000 .
0	i declined thier offer and they have now gone back on everything they have said and have advised i shouldn_'_t have been able to cancel anyway and they do not have to give a full_refund ( unless i want it as a voucher ).
0	this company is so frustrating , they have no commitment to thier customers and constantly contradict themselves !
0	i work in a customer service call_centre myself so i know how difficult situations like this can be however they have admitted it is thier fault , therefore why can i not have all my money back !
0	?
0	to some this situation may not sound that frustrating but please take my word for it , if you use this company be prepared to be disappointed , frustrated and unfairly compenasated .
0	after being recommended by my brother , i bought my reading_festival 0000 tickets online with double 0 tickets at a cheaper_than face value price .

0	can certainly recommend this service .
0	when we arrived in istanbul the driver was there holding up a sign with our name on and we paid for this journey when we arrived at our hotel .
0	were picked_up again 0_days_later , on time , and paid for this part of the journey on arrival at the airport .
0	reasonably_priced and would definitely recommend .
0	nice clean taxis and friendly drivers .
0	love the price match / reduction feature , and the freebies you can get at the end of your order !
0	!
0	i regularly book_hostels using hostelbookers . com , they tend to have an excellent selection of establishments to choose from and the search refinements bar allows me to narrow_down the possibilities to a handful that meet my requirements .
0	the website claims that the iphone 0 , locked to att , can be unlocked in 0 hours .
0	however , it is unlocked in 0 hours after they receive payment .. but by the time payment clears , you could have been waiting one or two_days .
0	however , the end_result is amazing !
0	absolutely_brilliant company had a problem with a buyer cancelling at the last_minute i spoke to katie who was very very helpful and sorted it out for me by cancelling my order and refunding into my prepay account would recommend using this company :-)

0	my step - mum had lots of furniture she needed to get_rid of and we were happy to have it .
0	but with busy lifestyles and a limited time - frame we didn_'_t have the time to hire a van and collect it ourselves so we used shiply .
0	what a great idea !
0	get your stuff moved by people who are ' going there anyway '.
0	it was very easy and smooth ; would definitely recommend it to anyone !
0	my order was dealt_with within a couple of hours of being placed online .
0	a couple of hours_later i was informed of the delivery details by email .
0	the next_day , on the day of delivery , i could track the parcel to a one hour delivery slot online .
0	the parcel arrived within that time_slot .
0	very pleased with the service .
0	i '_m often reluctant to order electrical items online but with a one year item guarantee and delivery service like this , i '_d recommend gogodigital and use them again .
0	ive used lastminute . com numerous_times as i alway get a great bargain .
0	ive booked twice for short stays in scotland and everytime they have came up_trumps .
0	both holidays have more than fulfilled my expectations , from the easy of booking to the information supplied .
0	i have now used mazumamobile twice and have enjoyed both experiences as they are fast and efficient , i have had no_problems what so ever .
0	i would highly_recommend the service they provide .
0	like many on this site i chose autoeurope for a trip to pisa , italy recently and was very dissapointed with the hidden_costs which ended_up doubling the cost of my initial rental .
0	to make_matters worse the customer service from their pisa supplier goldcar was horrific , we were fiercely given the option of paying up for the extras or leaving without a car at 0pm at night .
0	i paid the extra costs , thinking i would appeal to autoeurope once back in the uk .
0	only to be highly dissapointed again by a ' you should have read your contract ' response that took three_weeks to arrive .
0	yes sure , i should have sat down and read through with a fine_tooth comb - and will next time - but surely there has to an element of customer service , and an ethical if not legal obligation to be upfront about costs ?
0	i would avoid autoeurope , there are a number of rental_car companies out there who value their customers , make_sure you choose them !
0	i ordered my prescription glasses with the understanding that i could expect delivery within 0 - 00 working_days .
0	it '_s now been 00 working_days and counting .....
0	ordered a named necklace for my daughter as a birthday_pressie .
0	filled in shipping address , gave payment details .
0	money was taken frm my acc .
0	0_weeks_later i was sent an_email asking for shipping address !!!
0	this didnt fill me with confidence .
0	so i replied and asked why this mistake had happened .
0	a few_days_later i was sent an_email_saying necklace had been posted to a man who id never_heard of and an address id never_heard of .
0	once again i contacted them .
0	this time i just asked for a refund ...
0	almost 0_months later im still_waiting .
0	i did get an_email_saying they refunded on the 0rd_feb .
0	strange cause i have an_email on the 0nd saying they had posted the necklace that day to mystery man ....
0	this company in my opinion is fake .
0	they took my money and i have nothing to show for it .
0	left mess on the answering_machine n they havent got back to me either .
0	have now logged a fraud claim with my bank !!!
0	!
0	my advice dont use this company !!!

0	it was really easy to find tickets to see bruno mars in concert and i was confident that i was safe to buy from seatwave .

0	the concert was amazing so i '_m really pleased that despite not getting tickets when they were released seatwave meant i could still go .
0	i registered on saturday , by the monday the envelope and details for posting arrived .
0	i popped the phone back in the post as instructed and within_00hrs the money was being paid to my bank directly .

0	i have been browsing the river_island website over the past few_days , and have been very impressed with the wide_range of clothes online .
0	they have a " style for less " section for women '_s clothing , which is a fantastic idea , and full of affordable items .
0	i highly_recommend anyone serious about fashion , takes a look at this fabulous online store .
0	next are one of my favourite retail_stores in the uk , offering a wide_variety of clothes as well as a mixed array of bargains .
0	reebok are by far the best trainers i have ever used , i dont like the width of a lot of traininer as they dont fit correctly .
0	my best and most liked pizza company ever .

0	i just got a phonecall from my frail , upset grandma after she received a valentine '_s rose from me a day too late , which was headless with dying leaves .
0	she didn_'_t want to tell me about it and had been wrestling with her conscience before calling , leaving her very stressed and confused .
0	the customer service assistant i finally got through to on the phone was very kind and apologetic , and offered a refund at once , but this really shouldn_'_t have happened in the first place .
0	terrible experience .
0	the item we ordered was cheaper_than any other website we looked at and seems just as good quality .
0	we received updates from the helpful customer_services team regarding delivery and were really pleased with our purchase .
0	we were expecting the drawer_unit in green just because of the image but it doesn_'_t really matter as the black is lovely and we think we actually prefer it .
0	my only_negative , which wouldn_'_t effect me purchasing here again , was the strange attitude of the delivery men ( actually more the older man ).
0	they weren_'_t too pleased that i wanted the item upstairs and of course i understand it was heavy but i paid for the service which said delivery to any room with 0 men .
0	i don_'_t think they loved that i wanted to check the item first too ... but the delivery note says to sign off on this so obviously i wanted to check before signing .
0	to be fair they did their job , just with a little attitude , but i guess it was a large item for them .
0	overall a great piece of furniture at a great price .
0	the price was the cheapest about and the service was excellent .
0	chris the technician arrived within the 0 hour time_slot given .
0	he was very professional and efficient and had changed 0 tyres in about 00_mins whilst taking care , unlike garages i have been to in the past that have scratched my alloys .
0	thanks chris and tyresonthedrive . com i will be recommending you and using you myself again .
0	i booked return tickets to vietnam with carton leisure and initially they were fine , the e_- ticket arrived straight_away .
0	however , during my trip they changed my return_journey due to a cancellation which required a change of airports and seriously inconvenienced my journey .
0	my partner was on the same itinerary with alternative airlines who sorted his flight out no problem .
0	carlton however , demanded £_000 to replace my original fights and were rude about it too .
0	in the end i just bought an additional ticket from ba for only £_00 - half what carlton wanted to alter the trip ..
0	all in all a company best avoided .
0	!
0	i '_ve_used supplement_warehouse many many_times in the past .

0	have had a few orders from this site in the past but my dad always just added what i needed or wanted to the bottom of his order but i did one myself yesturday and it arrived this morning !
0	very very pleased !
0	i am left handed and i got a left handed pen for 00p !
0	a fine liner for 00p !
0	and a pencil for 00p !
0	and refill leads for 00p !
0	very very happy_bunny !
0	i am starting collage next week and needed everything i ordered quickly ( i did leave it a bit late ) and they didn_'_t disapoint !
0	i love how when i go to order something like the green staedtler pencil i ordered , it tells you what lead comes in it and the lead that goes with it was at the bottom of the page !
0	they do the same for pens .
0	makes_life so much_easier !
0	you don_'_t have to hunt for refills for other pens you just find the pen and it '_s at the bottom of the page !
0	overall a lovely , easy to use , cheap and interesting website with first_class customer service and post !
0	i originally used hello_canvas through an offer , but have come_back time and time again and always really impressed with the quality of the print , service and delivery .
0	the team communicate with you promptly if you send in a question / enquiry .
0	delivery timing is easy to track and accurate and the end product is always to a high_standard .
0	i '_d highly_recommend them to anyone and will certainly be ordering again through hello_canvas !
0	rubbish , had 0 everyone of them broke some way or other , slow , constantly freezing , hardly_ever have software updates - if i could give it less_than one star i defiantly would !
0	i '_ve been with them for four years_now so there for i will have a lot of complaints , for starters the only_reason_why i '_ve stayed with them is because of the hassle of changing my company , i '_ve had about 0 phones with o0 each time they '_ve broke , especially blackberrys , i will defiantly be changing this year as its a complete_waste of time and money , oh_yeah and upgrades are wank .
0	i bought 0 jeniffer lopez tickets for the o0 concert just a week before the concert at a very good price .
0	the seats were really good , my husband was really pleased as it was a present for his forthcoming birthday !

0	i needed a gaming_pc , but with all the ever - changing technology and the confusing mess of different opinions and recommendations out there from gamers and retailers alike , i wasn_'_t sure where to turn .
0	someone recommended the w0f website and i decided to give them a try .
0	the website is extremely customer friendly and takes care to explain what each component is and how it would affect your build .
0	customer service is unmatched .
0	they are endlessly helpful over the phone and respond quickly to emails .
0	after_placing an order you are emailed updates of its status throughout the whole_process .
0	i have had two pcs from them now and both are incredible .
0	fast , powerful , quiet and above all they last .
0	despite my oldest pc being several_years old now , it still performs perfectly .
0	this is a professional , efficient and extremely reliable company .
0	building your_own pc is a personal thing and these_guys realise that .
0	they tailor everything to suit the needs of the customer .
0	highly_recommend them .
0	i was trying to complain_about some flowers that i received yesterday from my son and his_wife from serenata .
0	they arrived with yellow leaves and looking quite dead looking and very sad .
0	my daughter has made several_attempts to e_- mail photos and it keeps being rejected .
0	not impressed !
0	the link to reply with a photo has no way on the page to respond with a photo making a complaint impossible by seranata the comapny itself .
0	it '_s very frustrating and costly trying to send photos by an i - phone ....
0	i have found this company to be awful and in all my attempts to email a photo of the flowers has_been rejected ... a complete_waste of my friday_evening trying to sort this out ... dont use this company
0	cheap and fast , but great quality .... what more can you wish for !
0	orders costume and had next_day .
0	very fast costume good too .
0	orange customer_services is decent .
0	you don_'_t have to wait forever to get through to a human and they are always very chirpy and helpful .
0	when i had to call for a replacement phone in the past , i found them to be quite rude , in terms of asking if i usually allowed a three year_old to put my belongings down the loo and suggested that i should have been supervising them better .
0	this was the only time i have ever felt quite angry with them but , as with most companies , if they are taking your money they are excellent , as soon as you owe them money or you want something from them they become quite rude !
0	they are better_than many providers ( i . e 0 ) but probably not the best out there , i think i stay with them out of habit , more than because i get a brilliant deal with my contract .
0	my friends are staggered that i pay over_£_00_pm and only receive free texts and my handset isn_'_t all that either ( which i '_m stuck with for 00 mths !
0	).
0	the delivery for boohoo has_been great ( ordered twice ).
0	however the quality of the items is left to be desired .
0	they are quite cheap but the first item i ordered ( a white quilted_jacket ) had black dots randomly on it .
0	i never returned it because it seemed like hassle but now i never order clothes and warn_people if they are contemplating it .
0	i bought some shoes and they ' re good quality but again unfortunately had a few random marks .
0	this means i won_'_t be ordering items form here often .
0	i discovered asos a few_years_ago and i have loved it ever_since .
0	i made a big order on tuesday and received everything ( except one item ) in the correct_size on the friday .
0	i ordered a size 00 and after not being_able to fit my head in the hole i realised it was way too small but couldn_'_t understand .
0	for some strange_reason someone wrote a " 0 " inf front of the " 0 " so it looked like a size 00 even_though it was just a 0 !
0	i contacted their customer service through twitter and though it did take a day or two to talk to them ( they ' re very busy ) they informed me that i can return it and that they would send me the correct_size for next_day delivery free of charge .
0	i also sent a skirt back for a refund and a pair of pants for an exchange and the money was refunded and my pants exchanged .
0	so in terms of the customer service they are competent and the clothes are of high_quality .
0	they are more_expensive than other online shops but i don_'_t mind as the clothes are made in this country instead of using sweatshops .
0	great variety , the best pricing , and amazing customer service .
0	with my most_recent order , i selected next_day delivery because i really needed it today , but it didn_'_t arrive .
0	it wasn_'_t a problem with the courier either ; i checked the bp website and they said it still hadn_'_t dispatched more than 00_hours_later even_though it '_s supposed to be guaranteed same day dispatch .
0	so be warned ; you may have to wait longer for your order than you '_ve been told .
0	that said , the products are generally good value for money .
0	i just wish they would expand their range a bit .
0	some nitrite - free beef_jerky would definitely make me a customer for life :)
0	avoid the scammers making counterfeit dangerous goods .
0	avoid !
0	we ordered some light_fittings from there , they were described as dangerous by a qualified electrician .
0	don_'_t_believe all the fake reviews , notice how every positive_review has bad grammar , mentions how the products were real ?
0	don_'_t you think that '_s odd ?
0	i completed the sage beginners course with this company .
0	the course was easy to use and i learnt a lot .
0	if i had any_problems throughout the course there was always an adviser on instant_chat who would help .
0	the customer service was fantastic .
0	i have had a really good experience with this company and would defiantly use them again !
0	thank_you !
0	katie brookes
0	the website was quick and easy to use , the main_thing that let my experience with double0_tickets down was that the tickets did not arrive until very last_minute and i found myself on the phone to them various times having to try and trace where my tickets were to ensure they would arrive in time .
0	i found the customer service quite poor as the woman seemed vey unsure and gave_me false_information about when i would receive the tickets .
0	she also seemed very against the idea of changing the address to that on my hotel so that i would definitely have the tickets in time , as this may have caused more hassle for her .
0	saying this , i have finally got my tickets today in special delivery but any later then i would have been unable to go to the concert which i payed just under_£_000 for .
0	i bought a pair from their cheap deal section , not name brand , came in 0_days with my prescription .
0	couldn_'_t ask for more .
0	my expectations were surpassed in every_single aspect .
0	when ordering with oak_furniture_land for the first time on their website i must_say i was a little_bit_dubious , without_seeing the furniture first hand .
0	i needn_'_t have been , i received a promptly telephone_call from their delivery guys , giving me 0_weeks notice for the delivery so i could make arrangements to be in to accept it .
0	on the delivery day again i received a call from the delivery guys 00_mins before .
0	when they arrived they were more than accommodating and made sure that all of the furntiure went exactly where it was meant to go .
0	on inspecting the furniture ( and believe me we inspected it !!)
0	it is perfect .
0	exactly_what we were looking for .
0	we will not_hesitate to tell everyone about the amazing experience we had from oak .
0	thank_you !
0	this was a perfect buy - taking the next step up from a baby car_seat pushchair .
0	the fact that the product was highly reduced due to it been a reworked model was great - the product arrived very quickly and apart_from the odd marks that was expected for a reworked item the pushchair was in fantastic condition .
0	the updates provided by the seller was great also .
0	all_round happy customer !
0	!
0	quick_turnaround time from sending phone to receiving payment .
0	0st_class company !!
0	fully recommended
0	no_problems arriving or leaving - happy knowing my car was left in a secure inside carpark and not open to the elements !
0	should i go on holiday in the future i will be sure to book the same carpark without_hesitation .
0	thank_you
0	i will never book a flight with this company in my life .
0	horrible booking_system , you can ´_t access to your booking and the costumer service is awful .
0	the people working with the phone , they don_´_t know english and are rude and unprofessional .
0	good luck if you have booked a flight with them
0	order my ticket almost over a month_ago , spent £_000 on two tickets , this is a korean band that ive loved for ages , this is the first and only time they will be doing a concert in london !

0	please get this sorted viagogo asap
0	me and my partner made our first order from the sh website and was especially pleased with the speedy delivery !
0	we ordered it on the friday before bank_holiday and it arrived to us on the saturday !
0	now if thats not speedy i dont_know what is .....
0	the only problem we had was with royal_mail !!
0	they couldnt fit it through the post box so gave_us 0 hours to pick it up .. off we went to collect our parcel only to find out the posty had gone on the missing list lol ... soooo the fun started tuesday hehe ..
0	i normally go to shop to get my bits , which i must_say the girls there have the best customer facing skills you will ever find in a shop !!
0	they make you feel so at ease especially if its your first time shopping for sex_toys !
0	well_worth going down there and having a look around !!
0	!
0	i have only ever done 0 other review of a website because on the whole you dont generally receive a service from most websites that warrants any merit .
0	however i cannot_fault the service i have received from country_attire .
0	i have made 0 orders with them in the last_week , one of which i needed to change the postage for .
0	customer service were more than helpful .
0	they email you back instantly and nothing is too much_trouble .
0	the products are excellent , very reasonably_priced and fast delivery !
0	excellent !!!!
0	!
0	mazuma is so simple and fast to use .
0	the website is easy to navigate and everything can be done within one week .
0	there '_s barely any paper_work ( apart_from the one that is sent to you with your freepost showing your order details ) and the forms online are straight_forward .
0	mazuma keeps you updated on a regular_basis and if for whatever you can '_t post out the mobiles as soon as you receive a free post you can ask for an_extension , no questions_asked !
0	i '_ve just cashed my cheque .
0	waiting for payment now .
0	without a doubt , the best mobile buying company i know .
0	=)
0	i found it dissapointing that i could not get a sample on the internet before ordering .
0	when i phoned to find out about it i got told different reasons .
0	the first time they were going to send me a copy for free .
0	then the second time i phoned because via_e . mail they were unwilling to send me one , the person i spoke to was quite rude and told me a different_story to the first person i spoke to .
0	the only_reason i ordered from this website is because i can not find the same invitations anywhere_else but i wont_be using the website again .
0	i ordered a wii u bundle from here .. cheapest by a mile (£_00 cheaper_than argos without the three extra games ) and ordered thursday_night arrived monday_morning free delivery .
0	very happy wirh the service so have used again for other games this week .
0	highly_recomended
0	i couldnt be_happier with the glasses i received .
0	perfect_fit perfect perscription and speedy delivery .
0	definatly going to use again and referred all my friends
0	they sold me a room on there site , 0 mins after i received a call saying they had to check if the room was free ( when booking a room i expect them to already have the rooms available ) it turns_out the room wasn_'_t available but they had taken funds .
0	they refused to except this and kept informing_me that i needed to get the funds back from my bank .
0	i had already called my bank and they said the funds had definitely gone to them and that they needed to contact their bank to cancel the funds .
0	i tried to explain this to olotels but they refused to except any liability .
0	i am now £_000 down and am now calling trading_standards to help me with this matter .
0	i would advise you to not ever book with this company , it is not worth the hassle .
0	i love it !!!
0	thank_you .
0	i will definitely tell people about your company .
0	keep it up .
0	always have the lowest_prices , delivery is really fast and customer service is first_rate .
0	never have any_problems with this web_site ; easy to use , simple and bright , search_function are fantastic and i always find something to suit my needs .

0	i '_ve been looking everywhere for a particular pair of freshlook colour blend contacts for cosmetic wear , and the pharmacists i used to purchase them from closed_down :(.
0	so i did some_research online and came_across feel good contact_lenses , and believe me it was my light at the end of the tunnel lol !.
0	not only did i find my contact_lenses but i found them so much_cheaper , i was so pleased i purchased two ( not same colours ), the delivery was so super_fast and the quality is perfect plus the extra discount .
0	i highly_recommend purchasing from them with their unbeatable prices and discounts not to mention their free delivery too .
0	overall i am very happy with my purchase
0	i purchased 0 superdry_jacket last_year off bank fashion .
0	with their exchange option available i ordered 0 in a size_bigger because they weren_'_t stocking my size at the time and they had 00_% student_discount promotion .
0	i received the items within a week or so which was fantastic .
0	0_days_later i checked back to see if my size was in stock and it was , so i prepared the item to be sent back for an exchange , i packed everything and took it to a local_store to send back using collect_plus service .
0	now 0 - 0_weeks had passed no sign of any delivery from bank , i contacted customer service i explained what had happened and the women took my collect_plus reference_number and checked status of my order .
0	she spoke to the internet sales_team and they told her they received an empty asos box under this order reference so they will not be taking action .
0	this was just absurd and i was furious i had lost £_00 and the item too .
0	now i contacted them on a few occasion to sort it out and each time the customer service colleagues were very rude !!
0	they told me they had images of what they received and they can send them to me by email but i have to pay them for the images ( what a load of bull ).
0	after that they kept telling_me i need to seek independent advice as they cannot do anything about it .
0	later i was looking through my emails only to notice that i had payed with paypal ( voila ), i opened up a payap dispute - it was a lengthy process but i had all my proof , i only asked a refund for the item i had sent back for exchange , however paypal got me a full_refund of all the items i purchased from bank .
0	i am so pleased i used paypal , and i have been ever_since for everything , you have so much more protection when shopping with paypal .
0	couldn_'_t stress how easy this website is to navigate_around .
0	sold almost 00_% of unwanted_books and dvds , however it would be far better if they accepted more titles .
0	compared to other_sites such as fatbrain and zazzle they have very competitive_prices .
0	great communication - they keep you informed about each_step of the process
0	fast payment_methods - paypal payment_methods allows you to get your money quicker
0	brilliant website to help you get_rid of unwanted_items and free up some room .
0	thanks webuybooks . com for your amazing service
0	first time planning my own trip ( and paying for it ) and hostelbookers made it easy , and didn_'_t charge any ridiculous booking_fees .
0	super happy .
0	:)
0	i don_'_t think i '_ve found a site yet which doesn_'_t offer cashback via_quidco , even if it '_s a few_quid back on a couple of new tops .
0	the best cashback deals are for changing provider for internet etc .
0	sometimes i '_ve had a delay in receiving the cashback but that '_s not quidco '_s fault , and as soon as you notify them they will pay you the money and get it back from the seller themselves .
0	i love quidco :_d
0	i '_ve been a member since july_0000 and have already got myself
0	" total confirmed & paid cashback £_000 . 00 "
0	just for logging_into quidco before ordering literally anything online .
0	i ordered my costume from friday 00th ( jason ) and love it .
0	the handbag is made of jason masks .
0	very good quality for the price .
0	it came about 0_days after i bought it which was good .
0	i would definitely order from allfancydress again .
0	i have already told all of my friends to get their halloween_costume from them !
0	absolutely love tpw .
0	value for money , delivery is so quick ( even with the economy one !)
0	and every product i '_ve received has_been high_quality .
0	hat the hidden_costs , but still the cheapest !
0	... but bald guy is so annoying lol
0	et_très_bon tarifs .
0	mais la prestation en a été autrement .
0	la voiture , louée via hertz , était dans_un état déplorable , sale et avec_des détritus a l ' arrière .
0	peu satisfaisant .
0	i ordered inflatable tropical items and i was really happy about them .
0	they were a fantastic addition to the party spirit .
0	brilliant !
0	:)
0	there are so many helpful reviews and it was so easy to use !
0	great website
0	i recently_purchased a beautiful bunch of sympathy_flowers for a close friend who is in mourning .
0	as the property does not have a secure porch or external area , i requested that the flowers were left with a neighbour if there was no answer at the door .
0	unfortunately this request was completely_ignored and i received a text_alert stating that the delivery had been made and the flowers left ' securely at the front of the property '.
0	i have no idea where they were left but there is no accessible secure area at this property .
0	not to mention the fact that the weather was appalling on the day in question , with heavy_rain and winds , meaning that the flowers would be in no state to be fit for delivery .
0	as it was , the flowers were never received , so i can only_assume they were stolen or were delivered to the wrong_address .
0	upon_receipt of the text_alert , i immediately tried to make contact with your company and found it extremely frustrating that there was no telephone_number available .
0	i therefore completed the ' contact us ' form and have received no correspondence since to give me any explanation or apology .
0	i wanted to book a holiday for me my husband and our 00th month_old twins .
0	after_searching lots of sites i found this one the easiest .
0	when i rang for a quote i spoke to charlie he was so helpful thought if everything .
0	the line was clear and i could understand all being said .
0	charlie made it easy arranging it all seperate but took it as a package holiday .
0	i would highly_recommend
0	i ordered 0 costumes for valentines the online service was easy to use :-) the delivery was speedy next_day well_done will certainly be using again ..
0	costumes was fantastic and was how described
0	out of all the websites i checked out supplement_warehouse had the best prices for the exact product elsewhere .. thank_you !
0	!
0	the service is amazing easy to use and the best part its eco - friendly :).
0	free courier service that comes on the day you are available , and i got an e_- mail saying the laptop had arrived and a second e_- mail_confirming the payment status .
0	brilliant and simple to use website , fast delivery and really good quality product .... will definitely use again and recommend to friends - don_'_t need to go_anywhere_else for these kinds of products now !
0	!
0	i looked on the website and submitted my phones , with in 0_days the bag arrived , once i '_d posted the phones i received my money he very next_day !
0	would highly_recommend !
0	i bought a wowcher voucher for a hotel stay , due to unforeseen_circumstances i no_longer need the voucher .
0	the very next_day after booking the voucher i wrote an_email to enquires , returns and customer_services explaining why i no_longer need this ...
0	a week and 0_days_later plus an additional 0 emails , i have still not received a response from anyone in wowcher , or my refund !
0	i am well within my 0 day return / cancellation period / duration .
0	yet they say someone will be in touch within 0_days ... lies
0	trying to call them is even harder .
0	i will never use this website again nor will i ever recommend their services to anyone in fact i '_m going to make_sure no one i know ever uses their site ... groupon are a lot more honest about the way they operate and are 000 times easier to communicate with .
0	and if within the next few_days i do not receive a refund and or a response from wowcher my lawyer will be in touch .
0	this course has helped in alot in my job which was the purpose , the system is easy to use and the staff are very helpful .
0	i would 000_% recommend this course .
0	thank_you very much .
0	my niece was over the moon , fantastic good value purchase with speedy delivery .
0	would definitely buy again .
0	some of the palest foundations were still very orange and muddy looking
0	well i ordered the bunch called wow as iv ordered them before for a friend and they arrived looking exactly as the picture .
0	wow consistes of reds , pinks , purppless , green , yellow , orange_roses .
0	instead yesterday my little sister got delivered a aldi quality bunch of flowers consisting of yellow flowers mainly , a white carnation and a couple of purple flowers .
0	awful colour_match , awful substitutes not on the same value as the wow bunch at all iv requested a refund .
0	another time i ordered from eflorist was mothers_day , i ordered sea breeze as it had gorgeous lilys and blue flowers .
0	instantly when they arrived i was in shock , purple white and green weeds it appears is a suitable sustitute .
0	had to quickly get online and ordered a beautiful bunch from serenata_flowers which where delivered exactly as they looked ( beautiful ) and were alot_cheaper .
0	eflorist said this was a suitable substitute .
0	im only guessing the site is a con , offering gorgeous flowers and sending weeds
0	disgusting vile service .
0	they still_havent got back to me .
0	hannah
0	had an offer of 000 for samsung_galaxy_s0 .

0	after thinking i had received nothing today off my boyfriend , he rang and asked me if i '_d had a delivery .
0	i said no and assumed they would be next door .
0	after lot '_s of investigating we found them at number 0 - 00 houses out - on the doorstep !
0	they had been delivered at 00am , i finally got them at 0pm - pretty_much dead !
0	00 roses on valentines_day half_dead , especially after thinking he didn_'_t care has left me and him upset !
0	he works away during the week which makes it feel worse !
0	i have tried_ringing them , i '_ve tried every number and each one just leaves a dead tone .
0	please add me to your trading_standards letter - i '_ll be only too happy to complain !
0	items as_described , well_packaged and delivered quickly .
0	will definitely buy from again
0	me and my partner ordered a curtain_pole , two end balls , curtain pull backs and a somerset bed_frame from laura_ashley .
0	we ordered online as it entitled us to extra discount for joining the site along with the bank_holiday discount .
0	the process took_forever to do , and several_attempts to complete .
0	we were given an_approximate waiting time off 00 weeks wait for our bed_frame , apparently this was because it was being ' handmade ' especially for us .
0	we thought that 00 weeks was a very long wait bit considering the type of company it was we aggreed .
0	around about 0 - 0_weeks after out order we received our curtain balls which may i add were left_outside our house for all to see ( even steal ).
0	when we opened them they were very damaged , immediately we took them back to the shop for an exchange .
0	when in store i got told that they couldn_'_t exchange but had to send the current balls back so new ones could be sent ( another long wait for my order ).
0	around about 0_weeks_later finally our curtain_pole turned_up along with curtain tie_backs , surprise_surprise these were damaged to , scratches and dents in the pole and all the packaging dirty and ripped .
0	again i went back to the store , the manager on duty that afternoon did replace it for me , this box was still damaged but the product was not .
0	last but not least our bed was finally delivered 00 0 / 0_weeks after ordering !!!!
0	again the boxes were damaged , ripped and quite disgusting .
0	i briefly checked the products , i couldn_'_t get them out of the box as they were very heavy and i needed my partner to help me .
0	i was assured by the delivery driver that all the pieces were there .
0	when putting the curtain_pole and tie_backs on we couldn_'_t use the screws provided by laura_ashley as the moment any pressure was put onto the head of the screw it would disfigure it and you couldn_'_t screw it in , we had to use our own screws , the pole again had our own screws in it and the metal was / is poor quality .
0	a few_weeks_later my partner and i began to get_rid of the old furniture and start to build the new , all the parts seemed to be there but we noticed horrible black marks on either_side of the bed frames , hot_water , fairy liquid , wd00 and sugar soap had no effect on these marks .
0	not impressed , considering the amount we paid for the bed_frame .
0	just to add more into the pot , when putting the frame together the ' pre_drilled ' bolt holes were not pre_drilled at all , the bolts would only go in about 0 / 0 way before jamming .
0	my partner had to go to a diy_store to buy a tool that rethreaded the bolt hold ( cost of £_00 . 00 ) luckily the bed went together , but the quality of welding , metal and finish is something to be desired .
0	we are currently in the process of complaining_about out damaged / faulty products , can '_t wait to hear from ' customer_services '.
0	so in our opinion the best thing to do is to avoid laura_ashley products , its far to expensive , poor quality , lots of mis sold products and very disappointing .
0	from now on the only shop we will be using is john_lewis - maybe laura_ashley should take some hints from them ... they know the meaning of quality products , customer_satisfaction and service !

0	my name was spelt wrong on the cheque so had to he sent back therefore delaying cashing of the cheque
0	i had a girlfriend recommend this site for their prices .
0	i selected everything i was ordering for a birthday and got to the end and the shipping cost was over_$_00 !?
0	because i spent the time adding things to my cart , i went through with it .
0	then it took 0_days to get a tracking_number , that did not show the product shipped for 0_days after that , then it took another 0 to receive !
0	?
0	00 - days for a shipping cost of $_00 + is ridiculous .
0	i was ordering for a birthday and the birthday was completely missed !
0	it should be expedited at that cost .
0	in the meantime , i have found another site goldentrainer . com that i found a discount_code online for 0 %_off my purchase + the shipping was only $_00 . 00 for the same exact order .
0	in the end , it cost me $_00 less .
0	their site is not as extensive , however , i received my order the next_day !
0	the service was quick and the website was easy to use .
0	brilliant that delivery is free over mother day weekend .... thank_you thank_you thank_you x
0	fabulous !!
0	i had a look through ' big stock image library to canvas ' i entered a few keywords for what i was looking for and the choice of images is incredible .

0	thank_you youframeit !
0	great ties for a very good price .
0	perfect colour for my wedding .
0	i couldn_'_t find anywhere_else the right colour .
0	viovet saves me 000 '_s pounds every year in food and prescriptions for my cats .
0	the delivery always_arrives with no mistakes , plus you get an_email_telling you when it '_s on it '_s way .
0	this service is way above any other online ordering and the quality of the goods delivered is always excellent - plus it often includes money - off vouchers !
0	it couldn_'_t be better and i would strongly_recommend viovet to anyone .
0	i was really happy with the wall_stickers we bought from dottyhippo .
0	they came promptly and were well_packaged .

0	they look great - thank_you !
0	the mama cocoon tops are both practical and gorgeous and the ones i ordered arrived really quickly .

0	lee provided an excellent service i would recommend him to anyone , he looked after my cat extremely well and she was in a large cage and had cat tray , water and food , and blankets .
0	he gave_me lots of numbers to contact him on and he kept me up dated throughout the journey .
0	i was worried to pay some of the money up front but he did an excellent job and gained my trust 000_%.
0	i can not thank him enough really good guy ( thanks you guys ) lindsey x
0	i thought it too cheap but was same as i buy in dilliards , iam happy
0	the only time you get a prompt response from this company is when you make your order , spend your money and possibly update your order .
0	after that their customer service is more or less non_existent .
0	no contact number , ubless you have ordered with them and even then they dont pick_up the phone .
0	i paid £_00 for flowers to be delivered in spain ( i live in england ) requested same day delivery .

0	god_knows what i am going to do now .
0	i should of just used [_external link_removed_] a like i was going to in the first place .

0	customer service was great !
0	very conservative and high_standard business attitude .
0	overall very pleased with services which has encouraged me to do_business with them again in the future .
0	i have been looking for the ' right ' set of mugs for years , my husband wants them large , my mum likes thin ' elegant ' ones rather_than cheap chunky ones which make your tea cold and i wanted a nice matching set so i can lock myself away from my demanding family and enjoy my tea and biscuits .
0	love my dunoon nevis colourful animal mugs and using them to teach my toddler his animal noises whilst battling with the chocolate biscuits .
0	great service from temptation , helpful customer_services email , arrived promptly and well_wrapped with free delivery offers taken_advantage of .
0	recommended .
0	we went on a hen_do to berlin with 00 people where we had two events organised by chilli_sauce .
0	the first was a bar_crawl where we were supposed to be taken to 0 to 0 venues over 0 hours .
0	the first venue we went to was a fairly average bar where no area was reserved for us so we had to stand around for ages waiting for a table .
0	our guide then_proceeded to smoke and chat to her friends for the next 0 hours .
0	she then took us to a club where we were able to get in on the guest_list but she then promptly left us there , 0 hours into our 0 hour bar_crawl .
0	this cost each person £_00 and didn_'_t even include transport .
0	the second event they organised for us was 0 hours at a spa .
0	we were given tickets and told to find the spa ourselves .
0	on getting there we found out that the spa ticket cost €_00 . 00 per_person on the door but chilli_sauce charged us £_00 per head .
0	the spa was basically a public swimming_pool with some saunas and steam rooms and our £_00 didn_'_t include any treatments or even towel hire that we had to fork_out another € 0 . 00 for .
0	it '_s outrageous that they charged more than double the normal price for the spa for providing no service other than booking some tickets in_advance for us when we could have easily purchased them at the door .
0	i have had 0 canvas_prints from hello_canvas now and love them :-) such great quality .
0	flowers where a gift to my nan for her_birthday and she loved them along with the little cake we included however they where delivered a day earlier_than requested when we kne she would not be in so nan had to go and collect them herself which wasn_'_t great .
0	i '_ve had a couple of orders with this company now & highly_recommend them , smooth straight_forward prescriptive & non prescriptive transactions & very informative when makeing equirys , i will_continue to use this company in the foreseeable_future as their was never any delays with my orders or postage they also offer discounts on future orders which appealed greatly many_thanks emma ;-)
0	i was very satisfied with how easy it was to search for items & extreamly pleased with how competitively_priced viovet is & even more impressed when my items were delivered very promptly thanks ;-)
0	i have ordered from here several_times_now and yes have had a few bumps along the way , mainly in_accordance with delivery timing issues but that is to be expected of a company that offers such a large region of service .
0	the items i have received are exactly as_described , fitting and incredibly beautiful , the prices are pretty reasonable to .
0	will shop_here til the day i die :)
0	i thought that the sight was very good ..,, the transaction was very quick and i was very happy with the reception i got .., the site is very easy to work , i will deffornatly be recomending you to other people ..,, thank youu x

0	i ordered a phone with 00 in toshiba hd tv smart_tv .
0	obviously they did not tell me what exact_model tv is , also image of tv was very small , you cant recognise it , so i googlet about toshiba 00 in smart_tv full hd , and was very impressed what functions they have etc .. so i ordered mine , but tv what came is rubbbish |, cheap quality product that is designed to fool peoples and trick them into buying them as smart tvs .. what kinda smart_tv is it , if its even dont have a function to record programmes ?
0	there is no sign of it beeing smart_tv .
0	packaging is very basic , very small instruction .
0	i feel ashemed for my stupidity that i was tricked_into buying this :(
0	i ordered a pair of the hunter adjustable wellies in black , and they arrived within 0 working_days . however , i changed my mind and decided that i wanted them in red - the returns process is really simple , i purchased the returns_label at a price of £ 0 . 00 , and you can set it up for ups to come and collect your parcel any day and between any hours e . g .
0	i did mine between 00am and 0pm on a monday , and they came around 00 . 00 .
0	easy wellies emailed me to say they had received and exchanged my order 0_days_later , and then i received my new wellies the next_day ( friday ).
0	i was very impressed with their service , and would definitely recommend them and use them in the future .
0	:)
0	i '_ve had at_least 0 pairs of specs from selectspecs , every pair has_been perfect .
0	the budget range is brilliant , and most pairs i '_ve had i '_ve worn everyday for a year plus .
0	iv had such a great experiance with this company .
0	i took up the sage 00 course and found it easy to work though and any_questions i had i was able to quickly speak with e_- careers and everyone was really helpful !

0	using supplement_warehouse for my nutritional_needs has allowed me to try several products that i would have never tried before .
0	with great sale and everyday prices , i can always afford what i need from month to month .
0	my products arrive within 00 - 00_hours so i never go a day without my supplements !
0	paypal have let_me down very badly .
0	i am an adult webmaster so i build adult themed website designs .
0	although i am only a designer and selling templates paypal banner my account and said i was not eligible for it to be activated again !
0	even_though i have not directly done anything wrong i can never use paypal again and their command !
0	not impressed and not happy and im not the first to complain_about them .
0	really enjoyed shopping around looking at all the colourful products - very girls and feminine .
0	says that they have handpicked their products and i don_'_t doubt that .. they all look .. well .. delicious !
0	arousing !
0	quick delivery and was in plain_packaging .
0	will buy from again , good prices .
0	i had a problem with my business_cards i ordered , they changed the font of the logo it was partially my fault and their fault .
0	after_speaking with customer_services they were very helpful and as a good will gesture they re printed all the business_cards for me .
0	i always use flyerzone for my printing and after this issue and how it was resolved , i will be using them again and again .
0	i ordered a netbook and a sleeve on the on the 00th_november_0000 by the 00 december i still_haven ’_t received it .
0	i login into the pixmamia site to see what ’_s happening .
0	under forwarding , the 0 products were there but with no date of dispatch .
0	it also said underneath forwarding “ products sold and delivered by pixmania ” mine was being delivered by royal_mail !
0	it also said in the email “ track your order ” this could not be done !
0	the customer service is the poorest services i ’ ve had in a long time .
0	the fact it takes them 00_hours to respond to an_email that ’_s if they respond at all !
0	the phone conversations i ’ ve had nobody_knows what ’_s happening , i was told a sworn statement would be sent by email to me it never was , i had to phone again the next_day to ask for it again to be sent .
0	it also needed to be signed my hand and posted back .
0	this was another few_days waiting .
0	all this time pixmania still had my money .
0	i understand that things go missing in the post all the time .
0	why is it that i ’_m doing all the chasing ?
0	i called again on the 00nd_december saying it been 0 working_days and i heard_nothing from you regarding the investigation .
0	i was told sorry about this i ’ ll send it to head_office for them to issue you a refund .
0	this should have been done straight_away not wait for me to call to find out what ’_s happening .
0	all the money i spent on phone_calls and my time wasted i would not advise anyone to use them .
0	i would rather spend £_00 more and deal with a customer service centre that knows what they ’ re talking_about and takes action .
0	i ’_m still_waiting for my money back now .
0	stay away
0	i was looking to sell what i thought was the 0st generation ipod_touch i looked around and gadget_panda gave_me the best price .
0	i sent it off and received a conformation_email when they had received it the next_day they emailed me to give me a revised price only £ 0 less_than the original price as it had finger_marks on it and was actually a 0nd generation ipod .
0	i accpted this offer and was sent a check which i recieved with in three_days very very impressed kept in contact throughout and let_me know what was going on .
0	would recomend to anyone and will be using again !
0	my partner and myself moved_house from a furnished to an unfurnished property and therefore needed a bed / mattress , dreams was the best price by far and the delivery dates were great just a couple of nights on the floor - however it all went down_hill rapidly
0	the order was places a month_ago the delivery date has come and gone - and we found out in the middle of the day when the mattress was due to be delivered that it was out of stock and wouldn_'_t be delivered for another 0_weeks .
0	absolutely no attempt was made to apologise , offer compensation and the fact that we are sleeping on the floor did not seem to matter to anyone .
0	i received a very rude phonecall to tell me all of this - but he couldn_'_t rearrange delivery - i was left on hold for 00mins before the system cut out
0	im yet to receive anything and frankly i '_m appalled suffer from a slipped_disc in my back and sleeping on the floor is not helping .
0	dreams you truly are the worst company i have ever_encountered and your customer service is the lowest of the low - i will not be using this company ever again and neither will anyone i know
0	excellent service , quick postage , really good quality products , never had any_problems with the service everyone coments on my braclet - have now bought some for my friends .
0	my coat arrived quickly and the website is fantastic .
0	really good prices , will_definately buy from here again .
0	my daughter was thrilled when the package arrived and we went through all of the things and had a conversation on how to save water and why it was important to save water .
0	good quality items , very happy with them
0	had a great experiance hiring a car through this company , was amazing price for rental and would use them again in a heartbeat
0	my daughter_loves these films and i wanted to get her the full box set for some time , i just couldn_'_t pass up this offer , i will_continue to buy my dvd '_s and games from zavvi for a long time to come .

0	have supplied myself and my parents with legitimate ticket to many o0 concerts with good seats !
0	also provided a legitimate ticket to reading_festival , despite reservations_about buying from resellers due to horror_stories from a few friends , double 0 tickets are to be trusted to provided real festival_tickets amongst others !
0	would certainly buy from them again , especially for events that our sold out , they are a good vendor to turn to .
0	i '_ve brought a few appliances and mattresses from buywise over the years and always had exceptional service .
0	if i '_m not sure quite what i want then they ' re there to offer sound_advice and are always competitive on price .
0	they are speedy to deliver and as they offer installation it '_s so easy .
0	it '_s great to know theres still retailers that know what they ' re talking_about .
0	the quality and price is amazing !
0	i just booked a hotel in london for my first trip to england .

0	i am writing following several_attempts to solve a serious problem i have had following purchase of a phone and contract online .
0	my phone has not been delivered and yet i am still paying the monthly_fee .
0	i have tried the online " complaints system " a number of times to no_avail ( they just did not get back to me ), and calling customer_services was completely_useless .
0	it is now over a month since my phone was supposed to be delivered .
0	keep reading for the full details ...
0	i ordered a phone and contract online from three and dpd were the chosen courier .
0	my parcel was supposed to be delivered on the 00th of june .
0	i heard absolutely nothing that day , but the following_day a failed delivery slip was left - one day late is forgivable and probably better_than other_companies offering the same service .
0	i found the delivery card straight - forward , completed the section which said " leave in a safe_place " and left the slip outside my door the following_morning .
0	having previously heard good things about dpd , i did not_hesitate to have the delivery man leave it outside the flat .
0	that evening , both the delivery slip and parcel were nowhere to be found , as it was late i decided to leave it until the next_day to call .
0	the next_morning i found a new delivery slip , not in my flat or outside the door , but downstairs in the entrance_hall to our set of flats .
0	it seems the delivery guy could not be bothered to come up to the flat .
0	i took this new delivery slip and completed the form online describing my " safe_place ".
0	the next_day ( four days after the supposed delivery day ) there was yet again no package .
0	after checking online , i realised that the package status was " delivered " and when i called up customer_services said there was nothing they could do until the following_monday when someone could talk to the driver .
0	i heard_nothing from dpd after that phone_call .
0	i called three the same day to let them know the situation and they said they would also investigate with dpd and let_me know within 00_hours .
0	00_hours_later i had still heard_nothing from either company , so i rang up three once again and the customer service operator said exactly the same thing as they had previously .
0	the next_day i received a call from three - as i has authorised dpd to leave the phone in my “ safe_place ” it was my fault the phone was missing .
0	three would not pay to send out a new phone and there was nothing they could do .
0	they did not offer any further help or advice , and did not even say how or when i could get my sim_card .
0	let_me describe my " safe_place " - it '_s a box outside our front_door , on the top storey of a block of flats with a locked entrance .
0	there are only two flats on the top storey ( six flats in the whole building ), and in the three years my housemate has_been at the property she has not once had an issue with a parcel going missing .
0	we have had countless parcels successfully delivered to us after being left_outside our door , including boxes of wine and an ipod .
0	i have since checked with all my neighbours to see if they buzzed anyone in , accepted delivery or indeed saw a delivery man that friday , but have come up with nothing .
0	an area which is not accessible to the public was defined as safe on the dpd website when i arranged redelivery .
0	i am now stuck in a 00 - month_contract with no phone , and no way to claim back anything .
0	i feel that when i purchased my contract it was three ’_s promise to provide a phone , and seeing as i have not received a phone i feel i am within my rights to stop paying my contract , but i don_'_t want to get into further trouble and don_'_t know how it will affect my credit_rating .
0	spending more money on a new phone isn_'_t an option for me now , which is why i chose the contract in the first place .
0	i also am completely unhappy that it is me having to go between three and dpd , spending countless time on customer_services trying to resolve the issue when it should be three who resolve it .
0	i have tried to contact dpd numerous_times ( and they have actually been helpful ) but they will not complete an investigation without three initiating the complaint .
0	in addition to this , the way that three has dealt_with my subsequent complaints is completely_unacceptable .
0	following my phone_call with customer_services i made a complaint with the tracking_number online on the 00rd of june .
0	i received an_automated_reply on the 00th of june saying that the team were dealing_with it and would contact me “ in the next 00_hours ”.
0	i also received a text_message on the 00th saying that they would come_back to me “ within 00 working_days ”.
0	in addition to this , three '_s website says “ if we cannot contact you , we '_ll leave a message and a direct number for our complaints team ”.
0	no such luck .
0	on the 0th of july i still had not been contacted at all and sent in a second complaint – which i didn_’_t even get an_automated_response for .
0	i have received no contact since .
0	it is now over a month since my phone was supposed to be delivered .
0	i feel completely helpless and taken_advantage of , and both dpd and three have offered no help or advice to solve the problem .
0	surely both_parties should be protecting their customers against things like this , and where a " safe_place " is indeed safe and only accessible by 0 neighbours through a locked door they should not be blaming individuals for the error .
0	i do not think that this is three ’_s fault ; i think that this is dpds fault , but three are contractually obliged to provide me the phone and contract that i have paid for , and resolving the issue with dpd is their responsibility ; not mine .
0	otherwise i feel that i am within my rights to stop paying the contract , and should report this incident to ombudsman services , and as a theft to the police ; at_least it may stop the same thing happening to someone_else .
0	if i could go back in time i would pay more and stay with my old provider .
0	the way i '_ve been treated and my problem has_been dealt_with is completely_unacceptable .
0	i ordered a phone and contract online and dpd were the companies chosen courier .
0	the day my parcel was supposed to be delivered i heard absolutely nothing .
0	the following_day a delivery slip came through my front_door - one day late is forgivable and probably better_than other_companies offering the same service .
0	i found the delivery card straight - forward , completed the section which said " leave in a safe_place " and left the slip outside my door the following_morning .
0	having previously heard very good things about the company i did not_hesitate to have them leave it outside the flat .

0	let_me describe my " safe_place " - it '_s a box outside our front_door , on the top storey of a block of flats with a locked entrance .
0	there are only two flats on the top storey ( 0 in the whole building ), and in the three years my housemate has_been at the property she has not once had an issue with a parcel going missing .
0	i have since asked all my neighbours if they accepted a parcel that friday or saw any delivery men but have come up with nothing .
0	so now i am stuck in a 00 - month_contract with no phone , and no way to claim back anything .
0	spending more money on a new phone isn_'_t possible , which is why i chose the contract in the first place .
0	i feel completely taken_advantage of and both dpd and the phone company have offered no help or advice to solve the problem .
0	surely both_parties should be protecting their customers against things like this , and where a " safe_place " is indeed safe and only accessible by 0 neighbours through a locked door they should not be blaming individuals for the error .
0	if anyone can offer any help or advice i would be most grateful .
0	always get good signal everywhere and if i have had problems with my phone they have always been delt_with promptly .
0	recently sent phone to be repaired was back within 0 week .
0	people at o0 who i '_ve spoken to over the phone have always been helpful .
0	was a bit_sceptical if this would work but money was paid into my account the day after_posting !
0	brilliant would definetly reccommend
0	comfiest pants ive_ever worn and i love that they come in so many designs !
0	cant_wait to see what designs are next .
0	i absolutely loved the way the entire_process got carried_out .
0	i appreciated the fact that i received emails_informing_me in which stage my laptop was in ( e . g . testing , quality control ) and that i could choose the delivery date that was most convenient for me .
0	also , i was gladly surprised i got texts on my phone telling_me around what time the courier would come .
0	it was overall a great service and also the laptop and the gaming mouse ordered are what i expected if not , better !
0	would definitely reccommend anyone to buy from pc_specialist :)
0	we booked flights to new_zealand via traveltrolley , and received a message afterwards that the reservation was not confirmed until flights were issued ( which was nowhere on the booking process until after we had paid ).
0	after 0_days of no confirmation_email , we called them ( and emailed twice ) to find out that they didn_'_t originally have those flights at the advertised prices , despite taking our money .
0	to add_insult , they advised that they wouldn_'_t refund the charge for another 0_weeks - leaving us completely stranded without money in the account as this is a £_000 flight over christmas .
0	almost ruined new years - we had to borrow money to book new flights .
0	in their marginal defense we got an_apology call after we complained about the service on facebook ( which promptly got deleted ).
0	i would avoid
0	i can '_t_believe i didn_'_t know about this before now .
0	amazing .
0	amazing .
0	i have used graff city on a number of occasions , and will_continue to use them for any supplies i need .

0	called and spoke to a rude man , who told me it was better to receive them earlier then late or never at all !!!
0	advised i won_'_t get a refund .
0	also then put down the phone on me .
0	email sent to customer_services , which i '_m_sure judging_by previous_reviews might never be answered !
0	had to explain to my mum why her surprise was now ruined , and why she now won_'_t be getting any flowers at all .
0	disgusted with the lack of customer service given .
0	do not use !!!!
0	i am completely appalled at the whole situation , i have rang them three_times_now .
0	all of those occasions i have spoken to poorly_trained_staff , who have never once apologised or offered any compensation .
0	i have now ordered from interflora , a reputable_company who i have used before .
0	it goes to show a good price is too good to be true , because the service is shoddy .
0	£_00 wasted , and £_00 i have been told apparently will be refunded when the " escalations team " reply to me , only if i refuse the delivery .
0	which , isn_'_t possible as its being delivered to a business address where my mum won_'_t be on saturday !
0	also advised that theres an option at checkout for gaurenteed sunday delivery .
0	what a load of crap !
0	i have gone_through the checkout_process again , and this option does not exist !
0	useless .
0	i will be reporting them to trading_standards , and i suggest looking elsewhere if you are considering buying from them .
0	* updated on 00 / 00 @ 00 : 00 *
0	just to update , i have had an_email from a manager stating that i didnt select gaurenteed mothers_day delivery , therefore will never get a refund .
0	i have called , and asked the person on the phone to go through their process with me , as i cant see this option at checkout .
0	when asked what website i was on , i told him iflorist . co . uk , he told me no thats the wrong one , you use m . iflorist . co . uk ( which i have checked now , and does have gaurenteed delivery option ) however , the usual iflorist . co . uk does not have this option .
0	he told me i was lying , and that i needed to refuse the goods in order to actually get a refund , which i again told him was impossible , due to this being delivered to a business address and not a home address - so i have no control over who accepts it and who doesn_'_t , as my mother wont_be there today !!
0	completely appalled with the service , so much for their no_quibble gaurentee !
0	more like , take your money and run !
0	i have reported them to the advertising agency , and will wait to be assigned a case manager for this .
0	i will also be contacting_trading_standards first thing monday_morning .
0	please_please_please do not use this company !
0	they are a liability , and will not be in business for much longer if they operate like this .
0	they are liars , and you will get a crap standard of service !
0	save_yourself the time and money !
0	would definitely recommend
0	i always end up buying multiple items from very because i expect clothing not to fit or for the quality to be poor , for example , so i order more than one item thinking i '_ll chose my favourite and keep that one but i end up keeping most items !
0	delivery is always super_fast .
0	treats are usually great .
0	i often buy other non - clothing items as presents or for the house and have never had a problem .
0	keep_up the good work very !
0	easy to use .
0	good detail of each car_park .

0	keep_up the good work very !
0	the booking was easy and quick .
0	the hostel was like expected / described .
0	the only_disadvantage was that the parking_space cost extra 00 € and this didn_'_t show up during the booking .
0	though , i would really recommed the service !
0	i '_ve been using hostelbookers for years_now , and it hasn_'_t once let_me down .
0	from the reviews , to the pictures to the rates , everything has always been very reliable .
0	hostelbookers remains to be my preferred_method of finding accommodations and it will be for a while !
0	the service is excellent , i was using a different company and it was a nightmare .
0	i had connection problems , interuptions , the line kept dropping in the middle of the conversation .
0	however since i came_across dial to save i have been one happy person .
0	my calls are smooth , and i dont have to call half a dozen_times before i '_m actually connected .
0	everything is straight_forward with dial to save .
0	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend dial to save
0	i can '_t_believe my luck in choosing this fantastic photography company .
0	exceeded all my expectations with great results .
0	my lovely photos will be on my wall forever !
0	everone who_sees them have given great comments .
0	competitive_prices and quick delivery
0	a young_girl came on our door and walked_into our house without asking and forced us to sign the contract before she would leave .
0	sent the company emails and 0 letters before the 00 day cancellation thing was up and nobody has replied .
0	my connection apparently starts tommorow and they have charged me 00 . 00 already even_though i havent used their broadband .
0	i want to stay on ee .
0	i tried_phoning to cancel before 00 days .
0	they are impossible to get_hold of .
0	i really just wanna cry .
0	i rely_on the internet as a agoraphobic person and i just want to cancel the contract .
0	im so annoyed and frustrated
0	i '_ve_used printerbasics a few_times , i find the website is clearly_laid_out and the items are sent out fast .
0	i '_ve had problems with the latest ink_cartridge , however sarah in their customer_services gave_me good advice to solve the problem and when that hasn_'_t worked she has arranged for a new cartridge to be sent out .
0	can '_t fault them at all and i will_continue using this company .
0	i bought some recycling boxes which were quickly delivered and although one lid had unfortunately cracked it was quickly replaced without_any_questions_asked .
0	prices are great & i love all of the free stuff !!!
0	!
0	great service as expected , everything came on time and was in perfect_condition
0	i bought some herstylers which i have wanted for ages but didn_'_t want to pay over the odds for them i found this website and was very happy to see the outstanding value for money !
0	the delivery was fast too one very happy customer will be telling all my friends about beautycow . com thanks x
0	i have brought from other_companies before and had nothing but dramas :(
0	these_guys are fantastic , good value for money and their service was good aswell .
0	any_problems and they are straight onto it .
0	they know their stuff :)
0	i placed an order on the 00 / 00 / 00 for new_kitchen accessories , mainly a set of tea , coffee and sugar canister and a few other bits and pieces .
0	all items were stated as " in stock " when i placed my order , and i was given a specific delivery date of the 00 / 00 / 00 .
0	the delivery date came and passed with no goods having arrived , so i contacted the company that day , and also four days_later having received no response .
0	i eventually got an_email on the 00 / 00 / 00 stating that tea canister i ordered was out of stock and this item had been cancelled , and the rest of my order would be dispatched shortly .
0	i emailed a complaint as obviously the rest of the set was useless without this item , and i was extremely unhappy with the wait .
0	i received a seemingly automated_reply to say that my order had been cancelled and , nothing more , no explanation .
0	the item that was cancelled , due to no availability of stock , is still listed on their website as " in stock " for home delivery .
0	truly appalling customer service , wouldn_'_t use them ever again .
0	emailed over a week_ago with a product enquiry , zero response .
0	very poor ( non_existant ?)
0	customer service .
0	service extreamly quick , took 0 day to receive my posting bank , and then another 0_days to receive my chq after i posted my phones off .
0	superior quality product and style that is hard to match elsewhere .
0	yes its pricey but it is so worth it !
0	the glasses i bought were around £_000 more in my local opticions and frames were out of stock .
0	i was hesitant at first about buying on line but after_reading the reviews decided to purchase .
0	i found the sales_person knowledgable and helpful .
0	my designer_glasses are genuine and in perfect_condition and arrived with my prescription lens next_day - i cannot_fault them some things arent too good to be true !
0	i ordered ( and paid for ) something 0_weeks_ago on the guarantee of 0 employees that it had been ordered and would arrive for christmas , only to finally get through to them on their never - answered phone today and find it '_s been_discontinued ...
0	they didn_'_t bother to let_me know this , call to refund my money or even bother to re - order when i paid , so now it '_s sold out everywhere and only available on ebay for twice the price .
0	grrrrr
0	best company i have seen and delievered my items on time , i will recommend this site to all my colleague , friends & family , they will love it to bits
0	i used hostelbookers for the first time today .
0	we arrived in cancun , mexico , absolutely exhausted after a multiple - layover journey from oregon .
0	it being late on a weekend , we didn_'_t expect to find much in the way of a good , affordable hostel ... but within minutes of using the site , we had ourselves a private , double , thatched - roof style room downtown for only $_00 usd .
0	a big score if you ask me !
0	my only_negative_comment , which wasn_'_t even that big of a deal , is when we arrived at the hostel very shortly_after booking , the staff said they had not recieved the confirmation , as it generally takes a few hours .
0	the manager was called in , and she expedited the process for us , but still about 00_minutes of waiting around when all we wanted was to sleep .
0	all in all , thougg , excellent service that i will use again in the future !
0	i wanted to purchase a crystal from incrystal , i decided to contact them first to ensure i would have no_problems .
0	i had a response within 00 minuites .
0	i ordered my crystal , they then rang me up saying " we cant do it for that price we will do it for 000 ."
0	they were requesting more money from me than the price marked on their website and no where on their website did it say price may_vary according to picture or any other terms and conditions .
0	i told them to refund my card and they told me they would do so straight_away and it would take 0 - 0_days to clear with the bank .
0	i have still recived none of my money back , and have sent numerous_emails to which i have had no response .
0	i am now in dispute with my credit_card company and am in the process of reporting them to trading_standards .
0	**** funny how they replied as they replied quick sharp when they wanted my money *******
0	i love that you can look at the map location , check out the reviews , and compare the prices for many hostels in the area and choose the best one to suit your needs !
0	really easy and helpful - no_complaints !
0	brought ticket to see comedian , and then read_reviews and started to worry !!!!
0	well there was no need to worry !!!!
0	super service , e_- tickets and great seats !!!!!
0	a very very happy customer .
0	will not rely_on this company and their services .
0	information given by one of the team was wrong , so my package has_been delayed by 0_months .
0	i believe it '_s wrong and now they i needed to pay a fee to return the item back to me .
0	basically given information been wrong so all service gone down .
0	not happy & will not use this service ever & will guarantee that my family & friends will not use your service .
0	was a little_anxious to book and hear i may not get my tickets until 0_weeks before the festival .
0	i was texted via the royal_mail and the tickets came via special delivery the next_day so i '_m very happy .
0	after contemplating for a few_months whether or not to get laser_eye_surgery due to being anxious as to what to expect , i decided to take the plunge and go for it .
0	i researched a few laser_eye_surgery companies and opted to go with ultralase due to the fact that they seemed very professional , helpful , informative and reassuring .
0	there was no_pressure , whereas the other_companies everything seemed to come down to the cost .
0	leading up to surgery , the day of surgery and after surgery i could not fault the customer service i received at all !
0	they took me through each_step very thoroughly and let_me know exactly_what to expect .
0	i was so shocked how quick and painless the procedure was .
0	the actual surgery time per eye was less_than 0 minutes and didn_’_t hurt at all , i would say it was a little uncomfortable and the smell of burning when the laser was on was a little unpleasant but in 00_minutes it ’_s all done .
0	i was amazed when i got up and could see the time on the clock across the room , it was brilliant !
0	an_hour after there was a stinging sensation and my eyes were watering as if i had been chopping onions .
0	but i did what they said and slept for a few hours after surgery and when i woke_up my eyes were fine and my vision was brilliant .
0	although ultralase was slightly more_expensive than some of the other_companies i researched .
0	i believe you get what you pay .
0	i ’_m so glad i done it ; my eyes were a complete success .
0	i would definitely 000_% recommend this to anyone .
0	i had no trouble at all booking my stay with hostelbookers .
0	my confirmation came promptly , and the reviews on the site were very helpful .
0	i would recommend hostelbookers to anyone looking for an easy way to find great deals for accomodation .
0	we had a hen_night booked for leeds for 00 girls things could have gone wrong however what an amazing night .
0	cocktail lesson was booked for 0 started spot_on 0 and were there for 0 hours had a right laugh would recommend ot to everyone .
0	the hotel was lovely friendly staff really nice breakfast in the morning and nor problems with the entrance into tiger_tiger the organisation from chillisauce was great ran like_clockwork all of us had an amazing night thanks
0	i think that the products you sell are of great value cheaper_than the shops especially for natural dog_food .
0	only down_side is that you dont sell nature diet in single packs and they only come in packs of so many my dog os to fussy for me to buy just one flavour .
0	your delivery is very fast within a few_days i had my package and the website is quite easy to navogate through .
0	i have now sold two phones to mazuma .
0	each time they offered significantly more than all competitors and the money was in my account within three_days .
0	everything from_start to finish was carried_out efficiently and with minimum_fuss .
0	i have been greatly impressed with them both_times .
0	both_times the service has_been first_class and i would urge_anyone to consider them over all similar_companies .
0	a great way to see a range of accommodation in any place you might be visiting .
0	pictures and a list of facilities available make it easy to compare_hostels and choose the one that suits you most .
0	i love this website , i '_ve bought 0 pairs of glasses from them and with every pair , the service was exceptional .
0	when i purchased some sunglasses , i had made a mistake with the order and someone contacted me immediately to clarify the issue .
0	the only problem that i have is that you can '_t try any prescription glasses before purchase and they cannot be returned .
0	also , one pair of glasses i bought are too loose and need adjusting slightly .
0	the fitting service is quite important to me so i do find this a little frustrating .
0	top_notch customer_care , really friendly guys , couldn_'_t ask for better service .
0	headphones are sick too !
0	very happy customer !
0	i found a pair of thomas the tank engine sneakers which were prefect , my son_loves thomas and is having his 0nd birthday_party march 0th .. thomas themed ..
0	so i purchased them feb 00st , had them shipped royal first_class mail ( which says normally 0 - 0 working_days ) it has_been way longer .
0	i have emailed on the feb 00 and have got no response and also have tried to call the number provided and says that it is not in service .
0	i would like to know_whats_going on .
0	they have been payed for and will be extremely upset if they don_'_t arrive for the party .
0	think carefully before you buy from there .
0	a lot of the stuff is very bad quality and made from b grade materials .
0	what they show on tv is not what they sell you .
0	it looks flashy on screen .
0	i have ordered many gameboy games from these_guys .
0	great prices and delivery .
0	if you want old school gameboy then this is the place .
0	very glad i discovered them .
0	have used them before to send money for a collection .
0	i am now trying to transfer to a bank_account .
0	still_waiting and its been a few_days .
0	does still say its in progress .
0	i hope it all goes well !
0	i tried them for the first time a few_days ago .
0	i bought some lovely sperry topsider shoes .
0	delivered so fast and shoe was perfect .
0	great company to buy from and great selection too .
0	awful company all_round , they will try to sell you all_sorts of random services that do not justify the original reason you contacted them .
0	they just want your money .
0	services such as sam amongst others is just a simple install of snow software .
0	utter_nonsense .
0	!
0	this is the first website i think of when i want to get upto_date with any new gadgets .
0	i love it .
0	have bought a few things and have always been happy .
0	i had the worst experience with talk_talk from beginig to end .
0	they were in deed quick to set_up but when problems came along nobody cared .
0	i asked to terminate the service as it was not reliable at all and i was refused .
0	i had to wait for hours to get through to the customer service team that is based in india .
0	there so many other_companies out there .
0	don_'_t choose talk_talk , you will regret it .
0	i am very pleased with the result .
0	your team has done a very good job .
0	i have recommended you to all my friends and everyone that comes into my living_room remarks and complements me on the canvas .
0	i would reccomend you to absolutely everyone .
0	very pleased with the work you have done .
0	thank_you very much .
0	staff were very helpful when i needed advice .
0	the course itself was very well_organised and very informative .
0	would recommend to anyone .
0	julie roth
0	purchased tripp_trapp_chair and babyset ( both walnut ), harness ( beige ) and cushions ( brown dots ).
0	the guidance on the website was brilliant although the pictures for the babysets don_'_t really reflect what you get colour wise .
0	in reality the colours match far better_than it seems from the photos , especially for the walnut baby set the colour seen on the website is a lot lighter_than the actual product .
0	i had however googled other pictures of the product so that i knew what i was ordering .
0	the dispatch was practically immediate and although we ' re up in aberdeen the item was delivered within two working_days through interlink_express , they even give you one hour delivery slot .
0	all around excellent !
0	thanks !
0	i always use hostelbookers , not just for hostels but for hotels too .
0	they don_'_t charge a booking_fee and are always the cheapest when compared to others .
0	brilliant service and the delivery guys ed and dex from swanley was brilliant and very helpful and polite very happy with my purchase and with the excellent delivery of the item
0	ordered a book that was in stock in the end of july_0000 .
0	after 0 week no book , then i called the company .
0	they had a lot of excuses and promised me that they would send the book the same day .
0	it '_s 0_months_ago , still no book .
0	don_'_t buy anything here !
0	ordering from denmark , i didn_'_t expect the delivery as fast as this .

0	bestilte dykkermaske og snorkel midt på dagen .
0	pakken kom med posten dagen_efter .
0	brugte grejet i sidste uge og_det levede op_til forventningerne , ingen vand i masken og ingen vand i snorklen .
0	har handlet med lavpriskøkken flere_gange startende for 0 år siden i forbindelse med opførelse af et sommerhus , hvor vi både købte hvidevarer , bordplade m vask , blandingsbatterier og alt mulig andet .
0	har senere købt hvidevarer til " hjemmet " og i dag endnu engang noget til sommerhuset .
0	meget flink fragtmand - og leveret til_tiden .
0	har aldrig haft nogen problemer , fik byttet en vask som havde en revne ( var ikke checket ved modtagelsen ) kan dog ikke kommentere service i forb .
0	med reparationer , da der_er_ikke noget der_er brudt sammen endnu :)
0	stor anbefaling fra mig .
0	vi_har efterhånden købt så meget hos dvdcity , så_de skal også roses herfra .
0	leveringstider er altid overholdt , der kommer mail når varen er afsendt .
0	og vigtigt - dvd ' erne er pakket så_de kan komme
0	ind gennem brevsprækken !
0	jeg ved ikke , hvordan det vil være at reklamere over noget hos dvdcity , det
0	har vi ikke prøvet endnu .

0	so excited to find this website !
0	great prices - especially with the price match !!!
0	easy to use , easy check out , quick delivery !!!
0	definitely my new go to for any of my needs !!
0	!
0	having been let_down by argos , ordered from dixons .
0	free delivery , received call 00_minutes before delivery to confirm i was in , took away old fridge .
0	ordered on the friday got it on the sunday .
0	fantastic !
0	ordered a freezer in july , end of september still not received !
0	cancelled and given up , went to dixons , delivered 0_days_later with no_problems .
0	store great , but don_'_t have anything delivered if you need it quick .
0	the best price available online and was delivered within 00_hours free of charge !
0	excellent product and fantastic customer experience .
0	will have no questions in using this company again .
0	after problems with my order with another company i went searching for a company that can provide me with the pet_food i need at a reasonable_price with fast delivery - my google_search bought me to chemist_direct .
0	their vast_array of item categories was astounding , but the site was very easy to navigate and i placed an order with ease .
0	i placed / paid for my order late thursday_evening , my order was dispatched as promised on friday_lunchtime , and was received via courier on saturday_morning !!!
0	00hrs from order to dispatch - doesn_'_t get any better_than this !!!
0	excellent customer service and an overall pleasing shopping_experience , will deffo be using making chemist_direct my regular supplier ...
0	with 00 guinea_pigs to feed , i get through a lot of hay per_month - my normal hay supplier was getting slow to dispatch / deliver and the quality of hay was deteriorating .
0	i decided to look elsewhere and came_across dustfreehay - their prices are very good and i only paid just over_£ 0 more than my usual_supplier for two large bales .
0	when i spoke to them on the phone , they were very polite and very eager to help - i was assured if i placed my order that day it would be dispatched and delivered the following_day .
0	true to form my order was confirmed and a few hours_later a tracking_number was sent to my registered email address - the very next_day i received two large bales of sweet_smelling hay - my pigs love it !!!!
0	i will definitely be shopping here again and will make dustfreehay my regular hay supplier ....
0	very happy :)
0	after_placing an repeat order with vetuk ( for 00kgs worth of pet_food ) i was surprised that i '_d still not received a dispatch email after the second day - i contacted them by email to which they told me they aim to dispatch orders within 0 business days - i replied telling them that my order was placed 0 business days ago - their replies were more of an_automated nature and not at all personalised - furthermore was the fact they made no appology for their mistakes / delays .
0	when i asked for my order to be cancelled if they could not stick to their 0 day dispatch promise , i was ignored .
0	i opened up a paypal_dispute and was told by vetuk that they had cancelled my order but they could not refund me until i closed my open paypal_dispute - this is obviously not true as when a buyer closes an open dispute without a resolution they forfeit their buyer_protection w0ith paypal - a clear breach of paypals terms and conditions .
0	i asked vetuk if they could fulfill my order by the end of the week ( 0_days_later - meaning a total of 0 business days since the order was placed ) and was ignored once again .
0	the only time i was refunded was when i mentioned that they were breaking paypals terms and conditions by forcing buyers to close disputes before resolutions have been made .
0	not once was i offered an_appology or a resolution to my problem - very poor customer service
0	i '_ve tried many online hostel booking sites .
0	but i found that hostelbookers is the best among all .
0	first , it is the cheapest site because no booking_fees are required .
0	second , it offers good reviews so that i can choose the hostels that are suitable for the stay during my trip .
0	moreover , i like their cancellation_policy .
0	you can cancel your booking within 00_hours without_any charge .
0	i simply like using hostelbooker and i would not consider other booking sites since i know i will get the cheapest and most quality offer from them .
0	when my regular mobile bodybuilding_warehouse freelance supplier failed to deliver my usual order of either chocolate or strawberry performance protein though i would have a look at the website and order directly ...
0	i first searched for a discount_code , and found an offer for 00_%_off , then i had a look at the site , and my attention was grabbed by the words ' chocolate and vanilla flavour ', my taste buds immediately started to tingle with anticipation , haha .
0	a couple of days_later when the product arrived i was far from disappointed , this was the best protein_powder i have ever had , it makes my daily fruit and protein smoothy even more of a pleasure than normal , and to mix with plane fromage frais or porridge is a true treat .
0	i have already_recommended this product to friends , and i will be buying it again , and again ... and maybe some more times too !
0	as a national powerlifter and strongwoman it is my new goal to be sponsored by this product !
0	hint hint !
0	;)
0	the staff are both informative an knowledgeable , i have purchased many items from them over the last few_years for my gym , highly_recommend and will be a lifetime customer .
0	kwikfit north road cardiff are highly_recommended .
0	think it was mark and anthony and they both stayed behind hours to help us , had a tyre blow out on motorway and they were more than ready to stay behind and wait for us to arrive in the recovery lorry !
0	can '_t thank them enough !
0	!
0	great company , fast and efficient service , greta communications , very helpful , pleasure to do_business with look_forward to doing more business in the near_future :)
0	thanks

0	i have bought a few books from wordery now and they always arrive promptly within the delivery frame_specified , the prices are reasonable and are a bit cheaper_than other online_retailers , they also have some american editions of books which i had been looking for and were a bit harder to find in the uk at a good price .
0	the service and price is all 00 / 00 from me !
0	definitely a reliable and trusted book seller for book worms like me :-)
0	i wanted to order cartridges for a my printer in a hurry .
0	after_spending some time searching a number of on - line retailers i found printerland . co . uk to be the best value .
0	the cartridges arrived the day after i ordered them !
0	great service - thanks !
0	i got an_email with a 00_%_off offer over halloween .
0	i took full advantage of it and ordered a tshirt .

0	i love this company !!

0	i ordered item through_groupon_voucher then had to pay an extra £ 0 . 00 postage + £ 0 " surcharge " only to be told via 0_weeks_later there was a flood in the warehouse of one of their manufacturers and that i could have a " full_refund ".
0	i got the money back from groupon but they have simply kept my £ 0 . 00 and so far have not answered any of the goodness_knows_how many emails i have sent them .
0	i know it '_s not much but the fact is it is my money which i paid in good faith for delivery of goods which i didn_'_t receive and they have basically stolen from me .
0	basically seems like a scam to me .
0	i don_'_t want to phone there extortionate helpline .
0	do not do_business with this company , wish i had checked this out beforehand .
0	i won_'_t be trusting groupon after this either .
0	i am_disgusted at how bad talktalk are .
0	they came to our house to give us fibre_optic ( we already had broadband with them ) and they left us that day with no fibre_optic and no broadband .
0	that was 00 days ago and i still have no internet at all .
0	they have said it '_s not their fault multiple_times and they have sent one engineer who didn_'_t fix it , another was supposed to come today and didn_'_t turn_up and now we '_ve been told we have to wait another 00 days !
0	terrible terrible service
0	purchased a blue gear 0 music violin for my son .
0	chosen by my son , i was dubious_about buying a cheap violin - as a violinist myself i have seen some real poor ones over the years !
0	well i must_say it '_s knocked my socks off !
0	strings settled quickly after a couple of days , pegs a little stiff but easily_rectified with a bit of peg paste .
0	for less_than £_00 it '_s a bargain and the tone is pleasing through the range also .
0	i '_ll definitely recommend to any of my future violin pupils .
0	delivery very impressive also as arrived as stated .
0	super stuff , a happy mum and a even happier son .
0	happy days !

0	[_name_] from p0g was very swift and helpful for me whilst trying to sort_out cancellations and refunds .
0	i have used hostelbookers 0 times to book accommodation for myself and family in the past 0 years .
0	their information and reviews are invaluable .
0	i would always use them above other_companies , as i find them to be the best value - and their website is really easy to access too .
0	ordered some flowers that were guaranteed for mothers_day .
0	the flowers were never delivered .
0	i spoke to customer_services and they called me a liar .
0	this is unacceptable .
0	i will never use them again and i would advise other people not to use them !
0	this site is simple and easy to use .
0	drop down boxes help you find the city you are looking for and choosing accommodation is simple using the tabs to look at rates , reviews and location .
0	even filling in the payment information and waiting for confirmation takes no time at all .
0	i would recommend to anyone .
0	easy and reliable .
0	would definitely use again and recommend to friends .
0	fast shipping , great price .
0	animed is an awesome website , easy to use and great prices along with fast delivery !
0	this has to be the worst internet company i have ever had the misfortune to use !!
0	!
0	i gave them 0 seperate_orders in the hope that my experiences were one offs , but no !
0	they don_'_t even hold anything in stock , they order once you order !
0	!
0	0st order - took_forever to arrive and the website said processing despite it had finally been delivered !
0	0nd order - i paid for the express delivery yet on the day it was due to arrive it still had not been sent out !
0	0rd and final order was a joke from_start to finish !
0	- i ordered mid dec in plenty of time for it to arrive in time for christmas , but no !
0	i had to email and call repeatedly to eventually get my parcel the second week in january !
0	never again !!
0	!
0	i have bought quite a few things from here now and delivery always within the time frame given .
0	also great to deliver to others as gifts .
0	no_complaints highly_reccomend using amazon !

0	nice selection and good offers .
0	free delivery is a big plus and my orders have been shipped quick and everything has_been in mint_condition .

0	we purchased my engagement_ring and both wedding_rings from marlow '_s where we were extremely pleased with the service we received .
0	a special mention for kym who was lovely !
0	thank_you !
0	everything was perfect .
0	i purchased a usb drive with a picture of our dog as a present for my dad .
0	i was sceptical_about how the picture would turn out but it was perfect , the quality of the product is outstanding , the picture looks fantastic and the delivery was so quick .
0	an added_bonus was that the product was half price when i bought it , but it would '_ve been well_worth the full price !!
0	i '_d recommend this company to anyone without_any doubt .
0	ordered some environ_products from this authorised supplier after having an online consultation .
0	very happy all_round with items , speed of delivery etc .
0	the items have a shorter shelf_life than when i have previously bought elsewhere , especially the colostrum gel gift with purchase which was received in feb_0000 and has to be used by march_0000 , but no big deal as environ_products have to be used quickly anyway due to the ingredients .
0	will use again .
0	easy to use website , delivered within time expectations - would definitely use again .
0	thanks
0	have bought dog bedding and dog_food at a reasonable_price , delivered free of charge and quickly .
0	good value for money and great communications .

0	i was happy with the product i purchased but delivery was very slow .
0	we visited diamond_dealer direct on saturday , the service we got from christina was first_class , she was attentive and listened to everything i said , even better she had a bespoke ring she had designed and had made that was perfect in every way ... exactally what i had been looking for , with help choosing the correct diamond to set in the ring .. liam managed to get it all made up for us on saturday so we could leave very happy .... amazing customer experience ... cannot wait to go back to purchase another :-)
0	shopto are by far the best site i '_ve ever used to buy and preorder games from .
0	they ' re now the only site i use to buy games from .
0	i '_ve never had a single problem using them .
0	their prices are unbeatable - plus free uk delivery !
0	-, shipping is incredibly fast - i have received games over a week before their release date .
0	basically they are fantastic , i would recommend them to anybody .
0	really not happy with this company i have sent so many emails about this and that i am getting sick of being ignored .
0	the flowers was brown and dieing and not like the flowers on the picture and i never got the bubbly i order which cost me 00 . 00
0	i spent £_00 . 00 on this company and got bad results never using this service again i have try calling emailing and calling the chat thing always offline got one email to send pictures as told and got nothing . i want a full_refund or i going take this further
0	i '_m still_waiting for a response to my email or i will get trading standard '' s involve and watchdog
0	hungryhouse has changed the way i order takeaways .
0	i hate using the phone , and never have any cash on me so it '_s perfect - i can order on my way home on my mobile and have dinner arrive shortly_after i do , without having to worry_about having the right change to pay for it .
0	really handy , really quick - great customer service on the rare_occasion that there '_s a problem .
0	great stuff :_d
0	a friend recommended this company to me and i haven_'_t been disappointed - this was the cheapest place i could find this laptop , and delivery was extremely quick ( ordered friday_afternoon , delivered monday_morning - even with the free delivery option ) with the laptop well_packaged and fully loaded with the software it came with - no annoying installing for me to do .
0	very , very happy .
0	everytime i travel in europe i use hostelbook . com to book my hostel because it '_s cheap and there is never any hassle !
0	we bought a be crib which slightly broke after a couple of months , i told the custumer service team and they reverted the same day offering to replace the broken part and they also gave_us a little present for our lovely baby_boy !
0	very efficient and nice people !
0	the website mentionned that the item was in stock with a 0_days delivery - 0_weeks afterwards still nothing , not even an_appology after 0 emails sent .
0	surely will never order from there again , i find it a disgrace that a company can treat its clients like that - if it was my company , custumer service would be key , i would have offered a discount , a voucher , and before anything appologies .
0	very fast and efficient service with no_problems what so ever +++
0	the customer service was amazing !
0	there was always someone around to help with any enquiries that i had .
0	the course had a nice layout and was easy to use .
0	needing a replacement electric_shower i came_across this company via a google product search .
0	the price was excellent but it wasn_'_t clear what the eta was on the item so before i placed the order i phoned them .
0	my call was answered knowledgeably , politely and i was informed how many items they had in stock .
0	at no extra_cost ( and as standard ) my item was dispatched via_dpd ( the best courier service imo ) and arrived next_day .
0	so not only was it cheaper_than other stores , but it arrived promptly too .
0	in addition i was given the option on their website of either registering or paying via_paypal .
0	it always bugs me how you want to buy one item from a company and have to register on their website so i always look out for paypal checkout options - there really isn_'_t any point registering with a company for one or two items .
0	this company allowed me to check out via_paypal saving me a lot of hassle .
0	they even put a padded_envelope into the box to protect the dial of the shower during_transit .
0	very thoughtful .
0	we purchased our first sofa for our first home from scs hedge_end in june_0000 for delivery in july_0000 as our budget was limited .
0	admittedly we were silly and chose a light_coloured fabric , however actually the fabric isn_'_t really a problem .
0	the salesman was alright but a bit scatty .
0	the problems started with delivery - i stood at my front_door and watched as my poorly wrapped armchair was dragged across the filthy , wet road out the way of a woman with a pushchair .
0	it was brought in and i noticed that the bottom was filthy and the fabric had been torn , well , shredded actually by its contact with the road and 0 foot was completely buckled and broken and another foot was damaged so i refused to accept delivery - they told me i had no choice and they '_d have to send someone to look at it as they are ' just delivery drivers '.
0	i told them to take it back to the depot but they refused .
0	i refused to sign for it .
0	they called a manager .
0	essentially i was bullied_into signing for my horribly mutilated armchair !!!
0	i then had to chase them to send someone and had to waste another days annual_leave hanging_around for the upholsterer .
0	to his credit , he fixed the broken bits but by then we '_d noticed that 0 side of our 0_seater sags considerably more than the other which we asked him to look at .
0	he claimed this was because the foam in the cushions varies in density and that it wasn_'_t a manufacturing_fault ...
0	0 years later and we haven_'_t even finished paying for the sofa and already it is almost unusable .
0	the saggy 0_seater is so sunken i '_ve had to put old pillows between the cushion and the base just to be able to get out of it - it looks awful !
0	that isn_'_t even the worst bit - just before they left one of the delivery drivers asked to use my toilet .
0	being polite , i allowed it - seriously wish i hadn_'_t - he left the room covered in smeared excrement !
0	i '_m not joking .
0	he blocked the toilet then used the toilet brush to try to clear it then clearly accidently brushed this against the wall , floor , door and the mat .
0	i had to burn the mat .
0	the brush was smothered with soggy stained toilet_paper and left hanging out of the holder .
0	i nearly threw up .
0	never again .
0	i spoke to the store who weren_'_t interested and i spoke to scs customer_services who promised to get someone back to me - 0 years later i '_ve still not heard a thing .
0	will never buy another sofa there again .
0	wishing i '_d spent the money in bradbeers now .
0	also i should mention that the hollowfibre cushions went flat in less_than a month .
0	i ended_up buying feather ones in dunelm mill to replace them with ...
0	edited to add : still got 0_months to go on the credit agreement and have already bought a new sofa - this time in bradbeers .
0	terrible product , terrible service and overpriced for the poor quality .
0	pet_food is cheaper_than a high_street store , comes in larger_quantities and shipping speeds are excellent .
0	so much more convenient than having to keep buying from pets at home and i can get_hold of less common brands and types .
0	would recommend medicanimal .
0	my only_gripe is how complicated it is to get a prescription for advocate .
0	my vet won_'_t issue one ( presumably as it is a profit maker for them ).
0	i bought a pair of playboy prescription glasses for just under a tenner including postage :_d .
0	ad received them in around 0_weeks :_d i must_say that i am very pleased with the service my glasses are fabulous and quite honestly i could not purchase anything as nice as these in my boots opticians .
0	i am already looking at buying a pair of sunglasses to match .
0	and my mum is going to get some aswell :_d well_done all the team for the updates by email on where my glasses are :_d :_d
0	excellent range of very clearly - described products , and an incredible customer_services department .
0	i was buying home_brew items as a gift , and i asked for advice : the customer_services dept pointed_out products that would be the best choice , not the most expensive ones .
0	absolutely the best place to go for your home_brew needs .
0	i '_ve tried other mobile_recycling_companies in the past but mazuma has got to be the most fast , efficient and communicative company so far .
0	i had the money in my account within 00_hours of signing_up with mazuma .
0	excellent and highly_recommended .
0	would definately use them again
0	good detail of the software - helpful team of staff when ever i had difficulties remembering my password too !
0	charlotte baker
0	like the products very much !
0	:)
0	and you should try it , too !
0	... nice experience .
0	the product is very lovely !
0	what a great assortment !
0	like it really much .
0	good navigation , great products .
0	love it !
0	having to pay for paperwork just because i '_m adopted and wanted to get married abroad was just another expense .
0	but tlc were really easy to deal with via_email and pleasant on the phone .
0	the turn_around on getting my paperwork translated , legalised and back to me was super_fast .
0	they have exclusive items on good prices , i saw a few things , i didn_'_t found on other_websites and perfume_click prices are much_better !
0	i really enjoyed shopping with them , and i will be defiantly back to it .
0	fast shipping international , cos when you buy your items , you do want them to come fast , which they did with a courier , so overall really happy about the service .
0	it would be really cool , if they would like give a few samples in your package of the new perfumes they having and all , but thats only a suggestion and everyone likes to get a sample and if its good , you can go buy it in 0 0 0 , so maybe in the future , who_knows !
0	this was possibly one of the worst customer service experiences i have ever had .
0	i sent my handset in for cash .
0	i had to call twice before i was sent a report from checkmend stating my handset was barred and i had 00 days to remove this bar or they will send my handset to ' the authorities '.
0	immediately and in haste , i emailed back asking who to call and for advice and assistance to get this bar unblocked and was abruptly told to read the report again .
0	i then called this company , got through to a man called [_name_removed_] who was nothing short of unhelpful , dismissive and rude .
0	there is a message from the md on the website , who says to email him direct if you want .
0	which i did as a complaint , twice .
0	both emails bounced_back , [_name_removed_] does not exist and in fact the md is from their parent company ecdl .
0	a company falsely displaying a non_existent md cannot be trusted .
0	i then sent the same email to an info_@ address , and this has_been ignored .
0	twice !
0	!
0	i then called my phone provider and insurance company and got this bar removed and told this company i had done this .
0	on monday 00th_march , i call this company up to 00 times and no one answered .
0	eventually i had to have an assertive conversation with a lady at the parent company who eventually got this matter resolved and my money in my account .
0	would i use this company again ?
0	not ever
0	would i recommend this company to anyone ?
0	categorically not .
0	did i report them to trading_standards ?
0	yes
0	have i got proof of the above things ?
0	yes .
0	be careful using this company and sorry that i have had to give you a bad_review , but until i am satisfied that you are a legitimate company who offers sound customer service , i stand by what i have said .
0	good luck in the future and if you would like more information from me , please get in touch .
0	fast , efficient and too tempting to buy more things that are far away !!
0	great service !
0	excellent site !
0	recieved just over_£_00 in cash_back so far after only a few_months membership .... savings i would not have had without this site !
0	has so many merchants , staff are friendly and helpful with any_queries , rewards for successful referals of friends / family / anyone to the site and i really wish i '_d joined sooner and would have even more savings !
0	i usually always go for chinese so don_'_t have any experience of using other types of food take_aways , but they have plenty of chinese in both areas that i have lived in the past few_years and the process is quick and easy .
0	instead of just having to stick with whatever take away leaflet you have at home , you can browse loads of different menus on here and they save your details so ordering is a breeze .
0	great , especially if you are feeling lazy : p
0	unfortunately i had to return a faulty tap , but darren in customer_services made the whole exchange process run_smoothly and efficiently , which made it hassle_free .
0	i was genuinely impressed with his professional and speedy response - thank_you !
0	pleased to say the new tap is working fine !
0	beautybay stands_out from all the online beauty " stores " with it '_s wide product range , good pricing and also fast and cheap shipping .
0	i made my order on beautybay . com because the products they sell have a well written description and quite many responses and recommendations from previous buyers .

0	my boyfriend found them on a forum and we decided to give them a try .
0	for around 00kg of meats ( chicken , sirloin_steak , mince , hack steaks and so on ) for £_00 you can '_t go_wrong and can '_t say no especially when your man can eat you out of house and home lol .
0	definitely value for money and delivery was when it was expected .
0	the contact was great and i always knew what was happening .
0	i '_ve been passing their info onto friends and family and we will be ordering again .
0	laura
0	i '_d never_heard of this company before yesterday and glad to come_across a delivery service that put aside my negative view of the usual suspect / s of crap delivery service .
0	on time , no sticking a card through my door and driving away without chapping and a friendly service .
0	i ordered from myprotein around 0 - 0pm and yodel got it to me before 00pm the next_day !

0	great website with good choice of products including alternatives to the standard .
0	everything is a very good price , i regularly shop around , checking reviews and prices on other_sites and shops but always end up buying from ebuyer .
0	delivery has always been well within the time promised and can '_t help take_advantage of the occasional freebie next_day delivery !
0	product descriptions are spot_on , you know exactly_what you are getting before you buy whether you are a nerd who_likes a full run down or if you rather stick to a brief_description ... it '_s all there !
0	customer service is brill .
0	good quality , clear , concise info .

0	easy to sell with a good price for an old brick .

0	i was given a day and paid for them .
0	they have never arrived !
0	i have tried to contact them by phone and email .

0	!
0	i am really angry about this and would never recommend this company to anyone !

0	!
0	cant even get in touch with them to get a refund ................
0	really helpfull company , very good on the technical side of things , needed a pump urgently rang them up at 0pm in the afternoon had the pump next_day .
0	excellent service
0	i used unique looks to purchase my regular shampoo and conditioner , as it was here at the cheapest price i found them both .
0	i was so happy with the quick delivery and well_packaged products - i will definitely return here for future_purchases .
0	i was actually blown over to receive my order as quickly as i did ( it came 00_hours after i had ordered it !)
0	i have ordered my nomination_charms from other online companies and have usually had to wait a good few_days , before receiving my order .
0	i had such a pleasant and hassle_free experience with identity - another good excuse for buying more charms !
0	excellent value too with promotional discounts , etc .
0	this is my second order with clare_florist - order arrived on the specified day , in good condition .
0	i would recommend this company without_any reservations .

0	would definately recommend this site to other people and fellow_travellers .
0	i now own two_pairs of ecco_shoes and both_pairs are very simple yet stylish , comfortable , and i '_ve had some people telling_me how great my shoes look !
0	they have a good size heel but still manage to be comfortable and easy to walk in , which is something that '_s hard to find these days .
0	delivery from the online ecco_shop was fast , and arrived well_packaged .
0	i ordered a garmin_forerunner 000 last_week from lanson running - it was one of the few stores selling the special white / green version that i wanted .

0	i '_ve been playing in sky vegas for some time now and have had a brilliant experience :_o_) there are great jackpots and a great variety of games .
0	brilliant site .
0	as if their low_prices weren_'_t already good enough , they '_ll not only match competitor '_s prices , but completely beat them .
0	they also have an unbelievable selection of products and i don_'_t even bother going into supplement stores anymore .
0	the only " downside " is the shipping_costs , but i usually get my supplements , a shaker , a shirt , and a ton of samples for what i would have paid for the product alone in a store .
0	totally worth it to me .
0	viovet was the only retailer i could find with a particular rabbit_food ( which i used in as a base mix for rats ).
0	it was affordable and the delivery was quick .
0	no_problems , great site !
0	i had absolutely no_problems with this course .
0	i found it incredibly accessible , with the ability to revisit modules and sections very useful .
0	the mini - tests throughout were also encouraging .
0	online help service very good also .
0	really had no_problems at all .
0	sold a broken phone and mazuma gave_me a set price online for the broken handset whereas other_sites gave rough estimates .
0	very quick , very east .
0	thanks .
0	i sent my device in to bozowi ( ipodphoto 0th_generation ).
0	i was given a recycling price of £_00 . 00 for a working device , which it was .
0	i had an_email 00 / 0 /_0000 from bozowi saying that they had received the device however it had been downgraded to £ 0 . 00 as there was a software corruption on the ipod .
0	in doing my research i found that this could simply be rectified by doing an apple software update .
0	i contacted the company bozowi to query this and explained i didnt think the device should be marked down for the reason they stated as the phone was only being recycled and it was neither here nor there as to whether the software was updated or not .
0	the lady could not give me an answer in which she replied , " look , you either accept the downgraded price or we can send the ipod back to you for £ 0 . 00 ."
0	customer service obviously not their strong point .
0	i was agrreaved that i would be paing more in postage than what they were stating was the ipods " worth ".
0	i therefore felt i had no option than to accept their price .
0	if the ipod is used to recycle parts why does it matter re .
0	software ?
0	obviosuly now i cannot test the item myself again without it costing me .
0	i know the value of the ipod was low at £_00 . 00 in the first place but it was the principal of it all .
0	i wish i had read previous_reviews of this company .
0	i will not be using them again nor will i recommend them to people i know .
0	they haven_'_t tried to sort this out for me at all preferring to adopt the like it or lump it attitude .
0	not very professional !!
0	!
0	update - received a further email later today saying that bozowi would not be able to process the payment as it has to be a minimum of 00 spend .
0	i cannot have the ipod back as the order has already been processed however they wont give me my money either .
0	i have to sell them more recycled phones etc to get the amount above 00 pounds .
0	i advised them i certainly wont_be using their company again and i want my money and they have declined .
0	i have asked to speak to a manager and this request has also been declined .
0	to me this borders on theft , all you get back is you should have read the terms and conditions .
0	do not use this company !!!!
0	!
0	i receive the item very quickly , and it was at a discount price .
0	my father had a stroke in february and had to give up smoking .
0	he used to smoke about 00 a day for around 00 years and i bought him a product from smoke_relief to try and help with the withdrawal .
0	0_months later and i have recommended around 0 or 0 people to this company because they are brilliant .
0	we order refills from them regularly and we have never ever had an issue .
0	delivery is always fast and the email communication is spot_on .
0	the main_thing i like is that i feel i deal with humans and not an_automated_system .
0	for example we recently got a little freebie for all the orders we have been making and there was a little handwritten_note to say thank_you .
0	such a nice_touch and a company who obviously values their customers .
0	placed our order at 0 . 00pm and by 0 . 00pm it had not arrived so i took the liberty of calling the restaurant .
0	they informed me most apologetically that they had not received our order from takeaway . com but as we were local they would do their best to get food to us in half an_hour , bless them .
0	takeaway . com then sent me an_email asking how my meal was so at around 00pm i responded by telling them they had not even sent my order over and that i would not be using them again .
0	i then had a missed call at 00 :_00pm followed_by an_email_apologising and saying the order i placed over three hours before had been cancelled .
0	who calls people that time of night ?
0	also what kind of an_idiot would i be if i was still_waiting for food 0 hours_later ?
0	i left it hoping they would leave me alone but on the 00th_january they emailed me ( generic email ) blaming their it system over the weekend and then_proceeded to offer me a whole £ 0 off any takeaway as long as i used it before 00st_january .
0	yes , they gave_me a whole 0_days .
0	i was tempted to email them once more but when i saw glaring spelling errors in the email i did not think i would get very far so again , i hoped they would just disappear .
0	however , yesterday i received an_email linking me to this site and asking for a review .
0	be careful what you ask for .
0	do not use this company unless you want to go hungry and if the other food ordering site is not working , better off ordering over the phone like the old days .
0	;) update_: interesting how the 0_star reviews below all say very similar nonsense and do not seem to come from confirmed purchasers like those of us who are giving bad_reviews .
0	fake much ?
0	just saying .
0	use these_guys quite a lot for bits and pieces for my hamster .
0	they are brilliant and i always receive my items within a couple of days .
0	i had an incident recently where i received something that had a manufacturing_fault ( it would not have been spotted when packed for delivery ) and customer_services were very helpful .
0	they allowed me to email a photo rather_than having to go through the hassle of posting it and waiting .
0	i got my refund really quickly too .
0	i have used several online pet_shops recently and i find netpetshop to be one of the best price and service wise and believe me i '_m very difficult to please .
0	:)
0	lots of info , easy to use pages , made booking an easy experience !
0	i cannot recommend crown_brush highly_enough , the item arrived the next_day .
0	the brushes are of a very high_quality , and the all eyes on you set is amazing ,
0	it '_s the only eye brushes i need to use on a day to day basis , they wash well , and are lovely to use , i wear make up on a daily_basis and my brushes get a lot of use , and these stand up really well to heavy use !!!
0	i can '_t wait to place my next order
0	i bought my wedding_rings from marlows .
0	the most elegant & beautiful rings i have ever_seen .
0	they made my dream come true .
0	great service & lovely people .
0	i '_ve the same story as everyone else , i ordered 0rd nov , have actually received today , box just abandoned at my front_door , but at_least its here , its seems good quality but only time will tell , though disappointed with the amount of filling , only half full ......
0	deramore is the best online_retailer i '_ve ever used .
0	i placed two orders so far and they arrived within two_days on both_occassions .
0	i had to contact customer service regarding one of the yarns i purchased since two different_shades were listed under the same name on the website .
0	i received a prompt reply and got a replacement yarn the next_day !
0	couldn_'_t_believe_how efficient and professional they are .
0	thank_you !
0	viovet were the cheapest for my dogs dap_collar .
0	the collar arrived the next_day .
0	excellent service !
0	i ordered a changing_bag from this website on the 0st of march , i received an_email conformation of the order and that delivery would be 0 - 00 working_days .
0	yesterday i phoned their customer_services to inquire as to when i would be receiving my bag only to be told that they had applied to my bank for the money but had never received it .
0	i then phoned my bank , who have no record of them applying for the money .
0	so i filled in the form on their website asking that why in the space of 00 working_days could they not contact me to let_me know the order had not gone_through properly .
0	this is what i got back :
0	dear mrs jones
0	thank_you for your e_- mail .
0	i understand that you were not notified that we could not process your order .
0	regrettably , this type of error does not flag up on our system , therefore , we are not able to let our customers know that the order has failed .
0	this is something we are currently looking into as we appreciate this is inconvenient to our customers .
0	i apologise for the inconvenience_caused .
0	how did they know not to send the package out ?
0	but still couldn_'_t contact me ?
0	i find that theres not enough information on what products they regularly sell , only information on the special_offers
0	the service was brilliant , it was delivered promptly and i was kept up to date via_email .
0	and some space back too !
0	0_stars here , fast shipping , always have the best prices i '_ve never had an issue !
0	i was a bit_nervous_about buying from this website , after_reading all the negative_reviews .
0	however , i received my order this morning , and i have no_complaints .
0	everything is pretty_much how i expected , and the delivery was amazingly fast - it came sooner_than my order from h_& m , which i placed two_days earlier !
0	they also shipped a couple of days earlier_than they said they would , which was a nice_surprise .
0	however , i think you have to be careful shopping on this site .
0	here are a few essential tips :
0	- use the ' ready to ship ' tab ( available on the left - hand_side of the page ).
0	this means that you won_'_t be looking at clothes that would take weeks to deliver , and it saves you so much time .
0	- when you find an item , carefully check whether the colour you want is in stock , and ready to ship .
0	i only selected items that were ready to ship within 0 - 0_days .
0	' out of print ' means that you won_'_t be getting that item , so don_'_t select it .
0	- look carefully at the pictures .
0	a lot of people seem to have thought they were buying another piece of clothing , from the way the models were dressed .
0	at the bottom of the page they sometimes have a photo of the garment on its own , which can be helpful .
0	it also shows you the thickness / weight / length of the item more clearly .
0	- don_'_t expect amazing quality .
0	i only bought items under_£_00 , so i wasn_'_t expecting them to be very well - made .
0	however , i was pleasantly_surprised by almost all the items .
0	i didn_'_t buy any handbags / shoes / jewellery because i thought there was a higher chance of these things being broken / poorly made .
0	i '_d rather try on a pair of shoes in my local shop and pay a bit more for them than order a pair i was unsure_about the fit / quality of .
0	- double - check the measurement .
0	everything i bought was ' one size '.
0	luckily , i seem to be that size - and everything i bought was fairly elasticated anyway - but the site doesn_'_t seem to cater well for sizes abover 00 .
0	- be prepared for a worrying ' you order is on hold ' email while they authenticate your credit / debit_card .
0	i got really nervous when they sent this to me , but they soon sorted it out and my order shipped the day after .
0	i hope that '_s been helpful .
0	in all , i loved shopping with this company - the website is gorgeous and the range is amazing .
0	i had no_problems with delivery or quality .
0	i '_ll definitely be back !
0	they dont reply to your mail , worse customer service i have ever had !
0	would totally recommend protected . co . uk , easy online form to complete and then excellent customer service on the phone .
0	no_fuss , easy transaction and no being ' on hold ' forever like some companies !
0	!
0	thank_you :)
0	excellent service .
0	easy to use site , service was very fast throughout from receiving the post kit through to receiving the cheque .
0	mazuma kept me informed by email throughout .
0	can highly_recommend to others .
0	sammie was really really really helpful with my parcels and also has very good taste in programs :)
0	really good quality service well_packed an clear_instructions not much more to say but i '_m impressed
0	my partner_loves watches and been a watch lover hes encountered numerous bad sellers i came_across watchwiseuk on the recommendation from a friend .
0	i called the shop looking for a breitling airwolf mens watch for him the guy i spoke to gary was more then happy to help and said leave my details and he would see what he could its wasnt long before he '_d called me back to say he had one so i went along to see it , it had had a recent service and was in near mint_condition the price was amazing cheaper then ebay ( very supprised ) came with box and paperwork .
0	what i will say is the service and the way they speak and treat you its like ye buying a 00k watch dont be like my partner whos lost ££££' s on ebay and other crappy online sellers these guy are the real deal and would totally recommend so give them a try first you have nothing to lose .
0	thanks guys needless to say my partner was very happy
0	great service and communication , super_fast postage & products are gorgeous !
0	excellent and fast service , had my money as promised the day after i sent it !!
0	!
0	i half expected mazuma to offer me less money than it showed on the website - i '_m just skeptical that way - but couldn_'_t fault them one bit and would use again .
0	far easier and faster_than selling on e_- bay !
0	i ordered a pair of boxer_shorts which are very good quality comfortable , the picture i uploaded was very good very clear i asked for the picture to be bigger which they did for me and i opted for the saver delivery , so thought they would take a while to come yet they didnt , i was surprised at how fast they came , i am a very happy customer and wud def recomend a friend and use tshirtstudio . com again
0	stocked exactly_what i needed .
0	pain_free ordering and payment on ebay .
0	good price and delivery was so fast i could scarcely believe it .
0	couldn_'_t ask for more .
0	just used anyvan . com to find a company / trader to move a sofa from bournemouth to bedford .
0	cost me less_than renting a van for a day and i had 0 great blokes to pick it up and deliver .
0	no_hassle , no_fuss , just post your job and wait for offers .
0	very easy to use and meant i didn_'_t have to drive down myself ( something i was v worried_about as i have never driven a van ).
0	i would recommend it over self - service every time .
0	great for those bulky ebay items .
0	i will definitely be using the site again to find a local man with a van to help me move house .
0	i am using this site for a christmas_present for my brother .
0	it is easy to use and navigate .
0	the item i originally ordered was unavailable so got an offer of other straighteners for the same price which i found to be a very generous offer and also received them next_day which was a great service .
0	would thoroighly recommend using this site .
0	many_thanks to simon and mario for helping throughout the process .
0	a big thank_you to graham for setting_up the extensions .
0	very pleased with the service .
0	thank_you !!
0	!
0	very bad company i would advise everybody not to use this .
0	i ordered my tickets 0_weeks_ago , for swedish house mafia the 00th of december in amsterdam .
0	the service which i have acquainted with has_been of the worst possible standard .
0	i ask viagogo ' when will i recieve my tickets ' and my reply is ' rest_assured your tickets will come in time '.
0	how can i possibly rest_assured when i have spent £ 0 , 000 in flights and accommodation which i am not covered on .
0	' the viagago guarantee ' is a joke .
0	all i want to know is on what day will i receive my tickets and is my seller still selling them or have they pulled_out of the deal .
0	in addition to this i will also add that when i have visited the viagogo website other tickets are clearly still available so why aren_'_t you getting in touch with other_sellers instead of leaving everything till last_minute and backing your business up with ' the viagogo gurantee '
0	my transaction_id is 0000000
0	i first contacted workwear_express with what initially seemed like a very strange request !
0	they were very accommodating and sent me out four samples with the logos printed / stitched on differently .
0	the second time i contacted workwear_express , we were under a very tight_deadline .
0	however , they managed to pull it off , printing and delivering 0 jackets in 0_days !
0	not only did we look the part whilst wearing them , they were of high_quality and most_importantly the branding was just as we had asked !
0	i would recommend workwear_express to anyone that wants honest , fast and excellent service .
0	not only was the client happy with the overall result , the whole team in the office were happy !
0	i would just like to especially thank a lady called cheryl douglas , not only was she a super star (!
0	), she managed the process from_start to end and personally ensured our products were on time and to the highest_possible standard .
0	i can not fault this company at all and look_forward to working with them again in the near_future !

0	a few hours ago , i purchased two tickets for the kanye west show at hammersmith apollo this sunday ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ).
0	after_reading_reviews for viagogo on various_websites , i am now close to tears at what seems to be the inevitable prospect of losing a couple of hundred_quid .
0	i wish i hadn_'_t purchased them in the first place .
0	after paying £ 0 . 00 for " express delivery ", i assumed i would be receiving the tickets by this friday at the latest .
0	however , i '_m now extremely doubtful this will happen .
0	i had a great experience ordering from marks_electrical .
0	i would like to also mention that cristian was very helpful and understanding towards our specifications and suggested the samsung es0000 tv , which was a great addition to our living_room .
0	so much so that we had to change it to a bigger_size , as we thought that 00 " was a bit on the small side .
0	we then arranged a collection and in the end , ended_up with a 00 " samsung smart_tv - which is brilliant .
0	great delivery times , great service , excellent customer service and really competitive_prices .
0	thank_you !
0	product arrived on the estimated_date and with free ' next_day delivery '.
0	i found the prices on save on laptops great and also the descriptions are more than accurate .
0	thank_you !
0	!
0	i usually moan_about delivery about yodel were fast , friendly and kept me up to date .
0	would def use again
0	had what i wanted , had had so many probs with amazon i gave up and looked elsewhere .
0	i found this website and the items were with me within 00_hours using 0st_class royal_mail and each item hand wrapped - couldnt_ask for better .
0	dont use large companies like amazon support people like this who actually care .
0	will bebuying more again very soon .
0	thank_you so much :) lisa
0	i ordered a very expensive pen as a gift from cult_pens (£_000 ).
0	received the item scratched .
0	not a problem these things_happen ( well actually this is the second time with cult_pens - but was not initially angry at this ).
0	as i was giving it as a gift i had a time frame .
0	cult_pens said that they could not meet the time frame as they were not willing to send out a replacement until they received the faulty one back .
0	what i found unacceptable and inappropriate was the communication experiences with cult_pens .
0	the company was not apologetic and not at all understanding - they were only happy to help out if i placed another order of £_000 .
0	i thought that this was excessive - i would be out £_000 of my bank_account for a mistake they made ( plus the postage and packaging to return the faulty pen ).
0	i said that i wasn_'_t happy with this arrangement and could i speak to a manager .
0	i was later phoned by helen who could only suggest that i use a credit_card because they payments might be more delayed .
0	when i said i didn_'_t have a credit_card - she said " well lucky you - some of us aren_'_t as lucky ."
0	not only am i a student and depend_on this money for rent i think that this was considerably inappropriate way to speak to a customer .
0	the conversations i had with the two women i spoke too were incredibly rude - asking me why i couldn_'_t get to the post_office the following_day - i don_'_t think it '_s unreasonable that i could only make the post_office the day after .
0	when i told them i was going in to hospital - helen asked if i was there now .
0	i think this is incredibly personal and again inappropriate .
0	when i asked to speak to or be phoned by someone higher up i was again phoned by helen who told me that i could not be .
0	i have no idea whether this was passed on .
0	i asked for some form of compensation for the trouble and i was given a £_00 discount .
0	regardless the shopping_experience was terrible and i did have to place another order of £_000 .
0	i had to ask a friend to deal with them on the phone the following_day to order the second pen because i felt that i was just not able to speak to them
0	to top it off the second pen received was also lightly scratched - i didn_'_t complain because i couldn_'_t face talking to the company again .
0	i understand that this is a small company and they have a great selection of pens but a service like paypal would have been useful and might have prevented this .
0	i love supporting small_businesses - my family are small business owners but i will never be using cult_pens again ( neither will my boyfriend for whom i bought the gift ) - the experience was inappropriate and terrible .
0	i '_ve_used parcel to go ireland to italy and uk to italy multiple_times over the last few_months and not had a problem .
0	pick_up has always been on time and delivered in good condition .
0	i made a booking error and contacted the team over twitter and it was sorted quick enough .
0	sam , steph and kate couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
0	i '_ll continue to use them into the future
0	great site love all their products .
0	i have found every product i look for every time .
0	keep_up the good work .
0	easily the best underwear i '_ve ever had , love the designs and love how comfy they are .
0	love that they come in a cool little tin as well i bought some to give as presents at xmas were great gifts
0	web_site is helpfull .
0	reviews reflect the hostel ive stayed at .
0	i love u can see so much about what u are going to .
0	i can '_t_believe_how horrible the past two_days have been .
0	i was expecting a straight_forward one day delivery and it ended_up being the most frustrating time !
0	i needed this delivery urgently for a job i had been commissioned to do .
0	needless to say that it all went wrong and this ordeal made me lose over â £ 0000 because my equipment wasn_'_t deliver on time .
0	there was no track of my parcel on the city_link website , i stood home all day waiting for it , with no tv , nothing , to make_sure i would hear the bell .
0	then finally , when an update showed up on their website it said that the delivery had been attempted and that a card was left .
0	it seems city_link staff_members pretend to deliver parcels while skipping the job instead .
0	unless i lived on a parallel universe for half a day , the bell never rang and there was no card .
0	the customer service was totally unhelpful , pretending that i was lying and that the delivery guy did show up when i was away ( tell me about frustration ).
0	i spoke to the manager who told me i should come and pick it up at their depot which is so far from my place , no local bus route would take me there .
0	i obviously declined the offer to pick_up the parcel since i had paid for a delivery not a pick_up arrangement and that i have no car .
0	they then assured me that the parcel would arrive before 0am the next_day .
0	i had already lost half of my wage by then so desperate as i was , i could only say " okay ".
0	the parcel did not arrive before 0am the next_day , in fact , it didn_'_t arrive at 00 either , nor 00 .
0	customer service staff tried to get_hold of their depot a few_times without luck .
0	finally around 00 : 00 someone from their hotline tells_me that the driver is a few streets away from my place and that he should get there real quick .
0	by 00 : 00 i still had no sign of a delivery .
0	i called again - i forgot to tell you that each time i called i waited between 00 and 00_min until someone would take my call - and was told the driver should be there by the hour .
0	an_hour later i get a missed call from an_unknown number .
0	i call back a few_minutes later .
0	it was the delivery guy_who tells_me that he tried to deliver my parcel but that i wasn_'_t there so he left .
0	what '_s wrong with city_link people that they don_'_t know how to ring a bell !!?
0	i tried the bell quite a few_times during the day just to make_sure it was working and it was .
0	that was just too much of a frustration for me , i had lost over â £ 0000 and the only_thing i wanted was my damned parcel .
0	the deliver guy did not bother coming_back , he actually asked me to go out of my building and look for him in a nearby street if i wanted to get my parcel .
0	facing the threat and the horrible attitude he had on the phone , i went downstairs and into the nearby street to collect it and have a serious word with him .
0	he didn_'_t apologise or say hello , he just pointed at the parcel , asked me to sign .
0	i asked for some explanation .
0	he told me that he was actually doing me a favour to come and deliver the parcel ( really ?
0	).
0	i asked him how come that everyone visiting me in the past few_days managed to ring the bell and that for some reason everyone from citylink didn_'_t .
0	he couldn_'_t answer and repeated that he attempted the delivery and i wasn_'_t there .
0	i obviously had enough with all this and just left with my parcel .
0	there is no need to say that i will never deal with citylink again and that i hope that this review can help people make the right choice .
0	i cancelled the other delivery i had scheduled to order through a different carrier .
0	i am leaving this review because it is not the first time that i have had problems with city_link but certainly it was the last .
0	placed an order on tuesday , 00th_july_0000 .
0	i have contacted many_times , be told the glasses ship from hong_kong , and they gave_me the reason is " there is very good a chance that they have been delayed in the postal_system and you should receive the presently ."
0	asked me wait 0_weeks for the respond .....
0	i remember the times when it would take a long time to fulfil orders , keys wouldn_'_t be in stock , but those days are gone .
0	cjs is nearly as quick a method as buying direct from steam or origin , i '_ve had no security issues either .
0	keep_up the great progress !
0	i love this website , the range and quality of products is fab and with the great prices rosina_romance is far better_than ann_summers .
0	my questions_regarding size of costumes was answered quickly and satisfactory and as a result it fitted_perfectly .
0	the delivery time was quick and i was really impressed with the quality of the product , the costume looked fab on gave the effect i wanted ;)
0	the website is easy to use , with detailed_descriptions of the products and the on - line chat option is fantastic .
0	i highly_recommend rosina_romance you won_'_t be disappointed .
0	i certainly will be using them again !
0	great service .
0	i entered the wrong_address and they called to reassure_me i would still receive he package on time
0	i have been a member of love_film for a number of years however i am now considering cancelling my membership since the amazon take over .... the ' new ' website is messy and difficult to navigate feels_like a step back and is clear designed to try and confuse you into purchasing dvd '_s from amazon rather_than renting them using the service you actually pay for !
0	...... added to this the number of blockbuster films that are not available .... it appears again amazon are being greedy and are holding back release of new films so that they can sell a dvd / blu_ray instead of you renting it throught the service you pay for ..... there appears to be a conflict of interests ..... amazon wants to sell dvd '_s / blurays and providing a rental service reduces the number they sell .
0	very pleased with flowers and had a very happy loved one who was so chuffed she sent me a photo of them !
0	brilliant way to get a number of quotes really quickly .
0	payment was easy , communication easy , payment easy .
0	what more could you want .
0	i ordered this through_groupon and before i placed the order had kind of low expectations ( due to other bad groupon experiences i had since i purchased this ).
0	the photograph on canvas arrived and it looked like a beautiful painting .
0	came out wonderful and fantastic quality .
0	very happy i took a chance on this one !
0	the flowers were gorgeous , however if i had not gone for a delux_bouquet them i '_m not sure that there would have been enough in the bunch .
0	delivery was very speedy , i placed my order on saturday_night for a monday delivery at no extra_cost and they arrived monday_morning , i received a text saying they had been delivered .
0	the only_negative with the delivery is that my message said ' the flowers have been delivered and left_securely at the front of the property ', i . e .
0	had been left in a box on the front_door_step .
0	overall great service and lovely flowers :)
0	every time i have phoned the customer_services they have always tried to help me as best as they can .
0	their prices are competitive and delivery fast .
0	i '_ve never_heard of this company let_alone bought anything from them , but i must_say i was impressed with the price of two_pairs of prada glasses with my prescription & the overall service .
0	i had a query which led me to emailing them on sunday and someone got back to me first thing monday_morning before the offices even opened .
0	my glasses arrived today , so a lot sooner_than i expected and i '_m overly happy with them .
0	thank_you to lucy and the team for all your efforts to have my glasses sorted & keeping my informed of the process throughout the week .. best service by far
0	i moved to first direct from hsbc in december as they offered a £_000 joining incentive and also where the provider of my mortgage .
0	i cannot_rate them highly_enough , its basically a more personal and friendly subsidiarity of hsbc .
0	they offer a local rate telephone_number which i think is pretty_much 00hour and brilliant products that i think are always cost_effective .
0	their website is easy to use and best of all they have a really well developed mobile banking app for iphone users .
0	00 / 00 and recommend to friends all the time !
0	i visited pasta brown after a recommendation from a friend .
0	there are three menu options ;
0	dine in , take away , express lunch
0	they offer salads and pizza too .
0	the family originates from naples and has_been here 00 years .
0	the service is still very personal , friendly and attentive .
0	thrilled at the idea of old_fashioned family restaurants ( dicipated by large food chains resembling cattle farms ) i asked the chefs in the open kitchen for a recommendation based on a love of spicy and strong flavors .
0	i was given the penne spinachi .
0	i am a foodie and eat out several_times a week , this is officially the best pasta i have eaten in london .
0	the quantities are massive and ingredients are completely fresh when you make your selection .
0	there is the option to have wholewheat and gluten_free pasta upon request .
0	whilst we waited ( all of about 00_minutes ) we where given a plate of gourmet garlic_bread with mozarella & tomato with fresh olives at a table .
0	highly_recommended to everyone , i will be a regular customer from now on !
0	thanks to the team working there !
0	orderd my t . i . t . p tickets online from this website .
0	was slightly_concerned website was not real after i bought the tickets but they were quick and fast at getting bavk to me and letting_me know tickets were dispatched .
0	will_definatly use this site again :)
0	if you ' re after quality professional photographic kit , try speed_graphic of alton , hants - seems to me their service is about as good as it gets .
0	their catalog is about the best thing going since the famous wallace heaton '_s " blue book " of yesteryear !
0	!
0	i was sceptical_about trying beautybay . com after_reading a few bad_reviews about poor service ad slow delivery .
0	i decided to risk it because they givea good discount and free delivery .
0	i am pleased to say it was worth the risk as the products came in good condition and within under 0 week of ordering .
0	i '_ve been booking last_minute tickets for sold out events with them for years and they never let_me down .
0	extremely organize service , simple , clear and prompt .
0	this time i booked tickets for ed_sheeran the day before the concert .
0	fair price , considering it was sold out and they contacted me not more than an_hour after i booked to make_sure of my delivery preferences since there was little to no time to waste .
0	since i decided to pick them up personally at their office they even refunded the postage fee !!!
0	concert was great ... i was exactly in the middle of the first row !!
0	i honestly couldn_'_t have asked for more !
0	!
0	extremely satisfied with the service ...
0	i definitely recommend them , especially if it '_s a sold out event or a last_minute decision !
0	!
0	susanna
0	absolutely fantastic .
0	they have everything you could ever need for a party .
0	have used this site a few_times_now and would not look anywhere_else !
0	brilliant delivery service , fast and great prices .
0	the item received faster_than_expected !
0	brand_new condition , the image meets the reality !
0	thank_you a lot , i will_definately choose babla '_s over someone_else , in the future !
0	id_0000000
0	i can not understand how it seems to take so long for the tickets to be dispatched .
0	as i know these tickets have been released and people on ebay seem to have them in there hands already .
0	i would prefer some update on my order states as the website is crap at this even the track your order page !!
0	as reading the reviews below its not looking promising
0	to your reply 0_days before the event is taking the mick as i know the person selling the tickets will already have them in they were released months_ago how do i know to trust the person_who is selling the tickets , have you not noticed the other reviews you have here stating that people have had problems with getting tickets in the past i do not see many happy customer reviews
0	sent my phone with the back damaged still got the full_amount the next_day
0	i love shopping with boohoo .
0	quality v '_s price is always great .
0	returns are no_hassle and i '_ve never had a problem .
0	shopped online with them many_times .
0	love their ranges
0	good price , very fast delivery .
0	item as_described
0	super_fast delivery and excellent customer service .
0	will definitely purchase again and recommend to others .
0	chris came to fit my two new front_tyres whilst i was at work , he was on time and he fitted both tyres in no time at all .
0	wonderful service and i '_ve already_recommended to a friend or two who just can '_t take time off to get to a garage .
0	great value , great service really pleased , thanks a million !
0	the driver indicated online that he attempted to deliver twice , but we were at home and the package was not delivered .
0	we phoned the company and they did not pick_up any of the four times that we called .
0	we contacted the sender and they told us that the package was being sent back to them .
0	this was not indicated on the tracking web_site , where the only information indicated that the delivery had been delayed .
0	the sender had to send it again , this time to a different location ( our work address ) and this time the package was delivered .
0	in total , the delay was of one full week .
0	i have ordered several_times , because it '_s the best price on the web , and i have always had a perfect experience .
0	the quality of the tshirts is very nice , the quality of the finished design is also perfect , and they arrive very fast .
0	highly_recommended !
0	have been using pet_supermarket for a while now and not had any_problems until my last order .
0	for some reason our company name was not put onto the box so the delivery company were unable to deliver without speaking to us and rearranging .
0	instead of us receiving the food we ordered on the saturday , it was monday before it arrived .
0	not a major_issue , but one that meant we had to buy food elsewhere to cover the gap .
0	prices are not much_cheaper_than other_places to be honest .
0	probably wont order again .
0	i used_resorthoppa based on a family recommendation and the fact there was a discount_code being advertised on their website when i went for a look .
0	we didn_'_t pay a great deal for our transport to and from the hotel but on the basis of it being advertised as a maximum 00 minute journey what could go_wrong ??
0	well , we waited nearly an_hour for the transport to turn_up after collecting our_luggage .
0	there was no shade and incredibly warm yet there was nobody around to provide any information as to how long the vehicle was going to be .
0	out hotel was very close to the airport and despite the promise of less_than 00_minutes we were on a coach full of other people for over 00_minutes .
0	we were the 0th drop_off .
0	on the way back we were waiting in the right area but when drivers arrived in similar vehicles to what we arrived on - none of the drivers called names or made any sign of trying to find the right people .
0	i asked 0 drivers if they were to pick us up and nobody seemed to have a clue .
0	once we were on board we did lap after lap of the area and the journey back to the airport totaled over 00_minutes .
0	absolute_disgrace , false_advertisement and there is no way i will use again when a taxi could have job for the same price and with so much less hassle and discomfort .
0	took the armani_watch my husband gave my son for his 00th_birthday to be sized at the norwich store .
0	unfortunately , the strap was broken in the process of re - sizing , which could have happened anywhere , however , they ordered a new watch , which was delivered and resized the next_day .
0	on the back of this level of no_quibble service , i would recommend them highly .
0	i missed the 0pm order deadline for next_day delivery , but rang up and spoke to a very helpful lady , who ensured i got the product the next_day .
0	the instructions are very easy to follow , and the matting is very easy to lay .
0	we bought this for my son '_s bedroom , and he_loves it .
0	we are now deciding which room to do next !
0	i was looking for a watch for my 00th_wedding_anniversary .
0	having narrowed it down to a few in jewellery shops , i decided to research online .
0	iconic_watches was 00_% cheaper_than any other web_site .
0	it took 0_weeks for my watch to arrive as it was not held in stock , but it was well_worth the wait for the enormous saving that we made .
0	excellent service , next_day delivery once watch was delivered to them .
0	would definitely recommend and use again .
0	ordered flowers on friday for mother '_s day even paid the extra £ 0 . 00 to have them delivered on sunday due to living so far away from my partners mum , they waited in all day for them to be delivered and the flowers were a no show .
0	called to complain and am still_waiting on hold 00_mins +
0	i have been using gjw_titmuss for over 0 years_now and have never had a problem with their service .
0	it was even a brilliant service whan we lived on the isle of wight
0	i google searched front line for dogs ... this website came up - tried it for the first time .
0	cheap product , good named_brand , fast delivery , couldn_'_t have asked for , or wanted more .
0	can '_t say more than just book it !
0	had a really good time all 00 us enjoyed it and found it was such good vaue for money .
0	it livened our group up ready for a great night out .
0	i '_m so surprised by this website .
0	i never even realised you could order glasses online before my friend told me !
0	the home_trial was perfect , you can choose the frames that you ' re interested in and try them at home for a few_days and then order the ones that suit you best .
0	it was sent out quickly and gave clear_instructions on how to send them back and when to do it by to avoid being charged .
0	when ordering , all you need is an up to date prescription given to you the last time you went to the opticians , and then once you '_ve picked your frames you can add any extras for a small_fee .
0	i will never be shopping at specsavers or any other high_street retailer ever again .
0	communication was excellent as any changes made to your order will be emailed directly to your inbox - keeping you up to date on what stage your glasses are at and whether they have been mailed out to you yet .
0	i '_d also recommend signing_up to their newsletter because they often include special_offers for subscribers - i did and managed to snag myself a 0 for 0 deal with free shipping !
0	perfect !
0	000_% fully recommended .
0	you really can '_t get any better_than this .
0	genuinely impressed with the overall service provided by iphonespecialist from_start to finish .
0	my brother had accidentally knocked his iphone_0s causing the screen to shatter into pieces and without insurance on his phone , the repair would '_ve cost £_000_+ to fix if done via apple and through the use of this website it was done quick and at a very reasonable_price .
0	communication was perfect throughout and we received the phone a day after they had sent it which was brilliant ( and i didn_'_t even have to pay for special delivery )!
0	iphone came perfectly packaged and even came with a free screen_protector .
0	finding it very hard to believe some of these reviews if i '_m honest .
0	i will definitely be using iphonespecialist again in the future and will recommend it to all my friends .
0	i recently_sold some phones to mazuma , they offered more money if you had the money put onto a card which you could use in argos , so i took that option ......... mistake , they make it so hard for you to spend the money , emails , activation code , several telephone_calls to 00 numbers , it has probably cost me money to get_rid of the phones !
0	much_better_than royal_mail , their standard service includes proof of postage , tracking and best of all , they '_ve never lost a package !
0	the can collect from your door if you don_'_t have the time to take the package , plus , there are various_options for drop_off , so it can be done if you ' re at home , work or en_route somewhere .
0	the only_thing i would change is maybe more locations such as a co - op .
0	lower prices are always welcome but the prices are reasonable .
0	providing the best rate around , whilst being super easy to use and having free delivery the next_day , what else could you ask for ?
0	my orders with partyrama are always quick and easy , i am very happy with the service and variety on the website and will_continue to always use party_rama :) thank_you
0	very easy to use , very quick response , very quick payment .
0	it is as it says on the tin !
0	i joined talktalk in feb and ordered the full package of tv , phone and broadband .
0	its fair to say sine joining i have placed over 000 phonecalls to talktalk due to major billing issues and tv / internet problems .
0	the first issue was the internet .
0	extremely laggy and continuously cuts off , especially after 00pm .
0	after_contacting talktalk about this issue they arranged an engineers appointment .
0	when he arrived he did nothing but tweak my speed from 0mbps to 0mbps ( just to let you know its now back down to 0 ) .
0	shortly_after i received my bill .
0	my package is roughly £_00 a month .
0	my bill came through at short of £_000 !!.
0	after around two_weeks of daily 0 hour phone_calls to talktalk they finally discovered i had been charged an engineer fee of £_00 even_though he did nothing .
0	after admitting it was a false charge the £_00 was removed and i paid the remaining_balance .
0	two_weeks_later i receive by bill again .
0	£_000 . 00 this time !!!
0	turns_out they credited the £_00 back into my account one month then re - applied it the next month .
0	obviously it consisted of more phonecalls for roughly 0 - 0_weeks while being constantly disconnected due to non payment even_though they caused the problem again .
0	the problem finally got fixed a few_weeks_ago and they took the charge off once again .
0	just to state my internet is still like the old style tesco dial up system .
0	secondly i had requested to pay by pay point , which requires a key_fob to be sent out ( lets be serious , who would trust them with direct_debit payments ) .
0	the first key_fob was requested at the end of feb . 0_weeks_later , still no key_fob which_meant last months bill wasnt paid .
0	i then find out that the customer service agent hadn_'_t actually placed the order .
0	luckily for me the call was recorded for my proof .
0	i finally received one yesterday .... nearly 00 weeks_later .
0	inbetween this time iv made numerous phone_calls to talktalk rude customer service agents and managers , been sworn at , and been hung_up because they '_ve been to busy to deal with me ( yes , iv been told this ).
0	iv also been disconnected roughly 00 times even_though iv had 0 - 0 different managers promise i wont lose my services while waiting on my key_fob .
0	tomorrow i will be placing a call to head_office and if they refuse to help i will be emailing the ceo directly .
0	i seriously urge_anyone out there even considering joining talktalk to run as fast as they can in the other direction .
0	if i wasnt stuck in an 00 month_contract , i would be with another_provider !!!
0	!
0	liked it , good service
0	very good service and excellent transfer of money for my phone that i sent to them .
0	i recieved payment within 0_days of sending my phone to them .
0	i would send them my phones again if i need cash for my phones .
0	using chillisauce to arrange my sister '_s hen_party was the best decision i made .
0	it was daunting at first however using this company took all the stress and financial side away from me .
0	i did not have to handle any of the girls ' money so if they didn_'_t pay i didn_'_t lose out ( or fall out with anyone !).
0	the organisation was fantastic , can not fault it .
0	friendly , funny staff at all_stages .
0	no request too much hassle .
0	i would highly_recommend using this company to anyone .
0	i will be using in the future !
0	ordered from here due to price , everywhere_else at_least £_00 more_expensive .
0	great customer service , always replied and very helpful , got order to me by date agreed in terms , even made sure i received the white ipad after i ordered black in error .
0	reliable tracked delivery .
0	paypal offered and i reccomend you use this for payment for your_own piece of mind .
0	really impressed with the company - just hope the warrantly does not let_me down if i have to use it ( fingers_crossed not ).
0	just eat has literally made my weekend .
0	i no_longer have to worry_about the shops after a long week at work , i just get my i pad place my order and 00 - 00_mins ding ( or knock in my case as no door_bell !)
0	theres our curry / chinese / pizza ect .
0	one of my orders had not gone_through correctly so just eat called me straight_away and sorted with my chosen restaurant .
0	just eat has changed takeways forever they are now bring in '_s .
0	you can even pay by card if you have no cash at home .
0	the ultimate in convinient food treats .
0	0_stars from me from a faultless company - keep_up the good work just eat :)
0	always great service from mazuma and used the bank_transfer this time it was so quick an easy
0	my husband and i recently ordered my eternity_ring from diamonds_factory .
0	we did a lot of research before_deciding to purchase .
0	i was nervous regarding placing such a high value order with an internet based company but i needn_'_t have been .
0	i received the ring last_week ( in 0 . 0_weeks exactly as promised ).
0	it was very well , and discreetly_packaged , sent by recorded next_day delivery .
0	the presentation_box and certificates are all perfect and the ring is simply stunning .
0	i literally could not be_happier with it .
0	and all for half the price of the high_street .
0	i would not_hesitate to recommend this company to anyone considering ordering a special diamond piece of jewellery .
0	i have received so many_compliments on my ring and i am absolutely_delighted with it !
0	thank_you !
0	very professional service .
0	we were always kept up to date with the location of our watch .

0	very happy with my miu_miu s and ray_bans !
0	i ordered zylkene for my dog and found animed to be much_cheaper_than the vets and the cheapest animal pet_meds website by far .
0	also very quick delivery considering it is the christmas_period .
0	will be using this site from now on and would definitely recommend to others .
0	had two flat tyres after stupidly hitting the kerb .
0	thankfully , eugene & kam came to the rescue within a couple of hours !

0	great job !
0	highly_recommended .
0	i have used this company many_times and are very helpful and have quick delivery , would deffinately recommend this company
0	after months of research – being the indecisive individual that i am , i decided to place an order for the beautiful swan chair in purple danish wool .
0	a couple of weeks into the order i decided to change to a black danish wool and a lovely lady on the phone was more than happy to change my order for me without_hesitation .
0	the chair is stylish and has made my room .
0	the purple is lovely but the black looks more classic i think and i will be able to use it in different rooms if i want to move it around .
0	i ordered a pair of butterfly twist shoes last_week and they came the next_day .
0	everything went_according to plan and the delivery was very quick .
0	so far in my experience , i have nothing bad to say about this company .
0	i just wanted to write in to say how thrilled i was with the service i have received from ukdigitalcameras . com .
0	i ordered a sony cybershot w000 on sunday and it was in my hand on tuesday .
0	i even had a fantastic call to let_me know the camera had been despatched .
0	thank_you so much - i will be recommending you to all my friends !
0	laura - croydon .
0	jenni dealt_with my problem today - she was extremely_helpful and left me a happier custome
0	muchas_gracias jenni !!!
0	regards from züruch !
0	slow process and still_haven_'_t got my cheque after 00 days !
0	the items were collected on the 00st_march and still havn_'_t had my cheque even_tho they did email me on the 00th_april saying it will be with me the next working day - that was a week_ago and no sign of it .
0	they also state there processing time is 00 days , it has_been 00 !
0	i have no emailed them asking if my cheque may of been lost and waiting for a reply
0	if they do finally pay up i will have no problem with the delay as i am in no rush for the money , but there website should state that the payment can take up to a month !
0	i ordered lots of items from here , apart_from one being out of stock everything was good !
0	they emailed me asking what i would like to do about the item out of stock so quickly and i just changed it for something_similar , they were so good at sorting it out and it still came within 0_days !
0	great customer service and great delivery !
0	items are all great quality

0	clear , easy navigation .
0	you get all the information you need about the place and the reviews of the places are really dependable .
0	a trusted company .
0	good prices and fast delivery .

0	cycling back home from barnes i got a puncture - the owner of this company came straight out of sainsbury '_s , took the tyre off my 00 year_old lucy 0 speed and helped_me pump the tyre up enough to get home .
0	i thought it was such a kind gesture to a complete_stranger , he took 00 - 00_minutes out of his sunday_afternoon to struggle with my wheel on the side of the road .
0	he even went off to get tools and a pump and came back to finish .
0	i would definitely trust him and his company - am_currently browsing for vintage_style bike bits on pedal - pedal !
0	got varying prices , didn_'_t go for the cheapest but good to shop around .
0	would use again .
0	my husband and i love this site .
0	its so easy to locate and book a babysitter in our area , and our kids have loved the babysitters we '_ve been allocated .
0	this website really gave_us hope that no matter what we have planned - we can always_rely_on findababysitter . com to look after the kids .
0	when using other booking sites , it feels_like i '_m loading page after page in order to book a room .
0	hostelbookers was quite refreshing in that everything i needed to input was on one page , and all the information i needed to know was included there as well .
0	i don_'_t feel like i '_ve gotten a better deal anywhere_else , too .
0	not only this , but using hostelbookers , you pay the hotel when you arrive at the hotel , which is something i like .
0	i '_ve been using feel good contact_lenses for over 0_months now and will_continue to do so .
0	it '_s easy to order your supply and have them sent straight to my home address with no_hassle and in no time at all .
0	prices are value for money and less then high_street retailers !
0	drivers were on time .
0	efficient and cars were very clean .
0	will_definately use again .
0	brilliant service , package arrived early and safely , thank_you .
0	great product as usual and very fast delivery !
0	you are number one for all dads_birthday and christmas presants !
0	thanks again
0	ordered the cheapest chest_freezer on the net , free next_day delivery , called to confirm the time was okay before they turned_up , spot_on time , opened it for me , took away the plastic_wrapping for us .
0	cannot_fault them !
0	used home delivery for a while .
0	i can '_t drive so when i was a student in bolton it was brilliant .
0	used to carry it upstairs to my kitchen and went through any unavailable or substituted items one by one to make_sure they were okay .
0	now its a complete_joke - the ashton - under - lyne store is now my delivery store and they are usless .
0	we don_'_t live_near an asda so this is really our only way but given the current service were switching to sainsburys , a little dearer but at_least i may actually get my shopping from them .
0	we booked a 00 - 0pm slot because we were in anyway and its a little cheaper .
0	000 came and rang the store , they advised they had had some trouble with one of the freezer vans so maybe a little late .
0	said thanks and kept waiting .
0	000 came and rang again , warehouse staff only guys available and told us that if the vans out it wil come .
0	0000 came and noone answering any of the phones at the store , tried the customer service line who tried the store - were advised it was on its way .
0	0000 came and tried the store , finally got told that the drivers had all come_back and gone home , no orders had been returned since 00 when this guy started his shift so must have been delivered .
0	called back the next_day and got rebooked for 00 - 0 with a promise of a phonecall to discuss compensation for the mistakes - assistant manger called who couldn_'_t help so manager would call at 00 .
0	no call .
0	chased and chased but the shopping arrived first .
0	not much choice other than to accept it .
0	two_days_later and several calls and still no call from the manager .
0	chasing again tomorrow or putting in a complaint with head_office .
0	we have had numerous other problems with delivery from this asda - missing items , wrong items ( wrong sizes , white sugar instead of brown , plain flour instead of self raising ), over charged , late deliveries , one time all of our frozen_food had been missed , last delivery all of the frozen stuff has defrosted and the chilled food was warm meaning most of it went off well way before the best before dates ...
0	the list_goes on .
0	first time from this store the delivery guy smashed a bottle of bleach and trailed it through the building , in the lift , in the hallway and into my flat .
0	it covered me and my partners clothes before we realised ( it had smashed then leaked over a load of the bags ) ruining our clothing and some of the shopping .
0	in all fairness they refunded that whole shop to cover the cost of clothing , but still , he shouldn_'_t have delivered it if he knew what he had done .
0	overall a bit of a naff service .
0	ashton store in particular is a crap store with a seemingly useless , uncontactable manager .
0	took me two and a half years to convince them i didn_'_t recieve an item .
0	they accused me of lying , called me a thief - they told me they had proof of delivery from parcelnet .
0	when i told them to prove it as i hadn_'_t signed for anything it turned_out the item was sent via_royal_mail on a standard delivery - yet still they continued to chase me for the £_00 .
0	after two and a half years the bill exceeded £_000 with all the fees and late payment charges .
0	i finally got them to wipe it and close my account ..
0	they then started chasing me to make an order as it " had been so long since i last ordered " - wonder_why !
0	i emailed their support_team back last_week to get this stoppedand actually close my account and haven_'_t heard_anything since .
0	they sell cheaply_made , over priced plus sized clothes knowing only a few high_street shops sell these sizes so some people are stuck .
0	there are better shops online ladies !
0	no need to settle for their cheap , nasty clothing and poor customer service !
0	edited again - they have changed their number - it is now 0000 000 0000 - similar method to speak to a person works - select 0 for tracking , 0 again for consignment_number , tap in 0000000000 then # to accept , it will then try and put you through to a person , takes about 00 seconds if you can type quick ).
0	apparently they have had some departmental changes so numbers changed .
0	also their international enqueries line is open later than 0 ( i spoke to them at 000 ) but they can help - 0000 0 000 000 .
0	i am due another parcel tomorrow , not holding my breath !
0	quick edit on how to speak to a person on the main line ... ring 0000 - 000 - 000 , select option 0 for redelivery - it will ask for the number from the card they left , needs an eight digit number - i used 00000000 the hit # to enter this .
0	it will read it back , press 0 to confirm .
0	it will try to confirm the postcode , press 0 to say its incorrect and tada you get a real_person between_0am and 0pm !
0	give them your details and complain away !
0	my review :
0	this is the second time i have had probems with this pointless firm .
0	yoursclothing only seem to use them even_though they are completely_useless .
0	first time they turned_up at the bottom of my block of flats and drove_away without so much as getting out of their van .
0	first time i got a 0 hour delivery window and when it passed and my partner advised they hadn_'_t dropped it off i got through to customer_services and got it redelivered that night .
0	the driver didn_'_t say a word to my partner and just drove_off after he signed for it .
0	the parcel had been clearly_labelled to leave with concierge if they couldn_'_t get in - clearly ignored it .
0	the driver denied this had ever been on the parcel - he had ripped it off when we complained !
0	the part of the label with delivery instuctions had been torn off leaving a hole in the bag .
0	advised them of this , got no response to my complaint .
0	typical it seems ...
0	this time is an utter mess ...
0	they couldn_'_t confirm a delivery slot of 0 hour so i got told between 0 and 0 via_email .
0	i rang to confirm they had the delivery details about concierge and how to get into the building - they confirmed it was written on the parcel , the woman i spoke to confirmed the delivery times were actually 000 to 0 and added my phone number to the system incase there were any_problems .
0	got to 000 and no parcel .
0	rang again and was told the driver had a flat tire so maybe up to 0pm .
0	confirmed this was ok , just urgent i got my parcel - she said this would be okay .
0	000 and no parcel , tried line to be told shut at 0pm .
0	tried depo after finding the number and no answer .
0	got email at 000 telling_me they had tried delivery at 000 and i wasn_'_t home .
0	this is utter bull , we confirmed with concierge that no delivery vans or cars that weren_'_t driving into the private car_park had been up the road and he certainly hadn_'_t left a card anywhere like the tracker says .
0	called their depo again and the only guy there advised there is nothing he can do as they are now shut - how convenient - driving putting getting back to the office on time over me getting my parcel - even_though i paid for next_day delivery because its urgent .
0	he has put it for delivery before 00am but given these reviews i doubt i '_m getting it this month let_alone tomorrow .
0	utter_waste of space , staffed_by liars and idots !
0	i wanted to cancel my order , and sammie_taylor cancelled my order in a second and i got my refund back .
0	very professional !
0	ordered some flowers to be sent to my partner at her work for friday 00th_december .
0	decided to choose the christmas kisses selection .
0	ordering was quite straight_forward and with free delivery it seemed too good to be true ... well it was ....
0	i decided to pay the extra £ 0 . 00 ish which stated ' guaranteed immediate email when flowers delivered ' as i thought well at_least that way i '_ll know everyone has_gone_smoothly .
0	well about midday i got a txt from my partner to say she had received that ...
0	yet no ' guaranteed ' email which i paid the extra for !
0	i emailed them ... no reply .
0	i then got my ' guaranteed immediate email ' from them yesterday_afternoon to which i then forwarded this onto them stating they should at_least refund this charge to me .
0	no reply .
0	i went to visit my partner last night and asked to see the flowers and oh my god iv never felt so embarrassed in my life !!
0	they look nothing like the flowers i ordered .
0	instead it '_s all green rubbish - i have no idea what it is apart_from foliage i think it '_s called - i '_m not a flower person .
0	but yes they looked dreadful !
0	imagine my surprise when i then looked on here to see what the reviews were like and everyone is complaining_about the same thing and that the company never reply to emails .
0	well i '_m not gonna waste my time phoning the premium_rate number as i can '_t be wasting anymore of my money when they aren_'_t in any way helpful or apologetic and don_'_t seem to care .
0	i '_m a team_leader in a call_centre myself and blimey if we treated our customers like that , we wouldn_'_t have any and would have rubbish reviews like this !!
0	seeing as our reviews on trust_pilot are 00 . 0 i think it speaks for itself .
0	i florist need to get their act_together or they won_'_t have any customers left .
0	you are a disgrace !
0	and i can '_t_believe you don_'_t even get back to customers who email you !
0	disgusting service and i won_'_t use them again .
0	stick to what you know for future people
0	i tend to hardly use amazon as prefer the quicker easier service on ebay , play . com etc .
0	however i wanted a scholl express pedi so was shopping around for the cheapest price .
0	found the product for £_00 . 00 - approx_£_00 cheaper_than_anywhere_else .
0	bargain i thought so logged on the next_day to buy the item and surprise_surprise they had put it up by £_00 . 00 !!!
0	spoke to amazon on customer support and they tried fobbing_me off saying prices hadn_'_t changed for the item since october ( they checked their catalogue ) apparently .
0	so i went back saying they were lying as my colleague at work had actually bought the product 0 - 0_days earlier at the £_00 . 00 price .
0	funnily_enough when i offered to give the order details they didn_'_t want to know .
0	just said the price is the price which i thought was an absolutely joke .
0	i work as a team_leader in customer_services and if one of our customers complained about something like this we would honour the price for them !
0	if we said ' the price is the price ' i think we would lose a hell of a lot of business but then amazon are a company that are too_big for their boots nowadays .
0	oh worse is to come .... 0 - 00 days_later - the express pedi went on the black friday sale at 0 . 00pm for .. yep u guessed it ... £_00 . 00 !
0	funny the customer service guy didnt mention this at the time of my complaint .
0	i '_ve now decided they must '_ve put it up to to then put it down again on black friday to make it seem like people are getting a bargain !
0	joke .
0	end of .
0	i bought a jacket from boohoo . com , it only took a couple of days to arrive and it was perfect , the jacket is gorgeous !
0	i received my glasses and couldn_'_t see through them !
0	i ended_up going to another company and paying over_£_000 for a decent pair !
0	i had a paypal_account for 0 years so that i could use ebay , until i spent over_£_000 and they stopped my account !
0	they asked for verification , they said they would send me a letter with a code on it , 0_months later i '_m still_waiting on the letter !
0	i give up on it .
0	i recently bought a tapestry kit from argos and it '_s excellent , i reserved it online and picked it up the next_day !
0	i use this instead of calling for a takeaway , its so much_easier doing it all online and paying online , that way you dont have to call and have confusion when someone doesn_'_t understand my accent and i dont have to hand over any cash at the door .
0	i '_ve been with sky for over a year now and i still have no_complaints , i like that i can check my bill online and update my package if i like .

0	i recently won a prize basket of flowers and they are so beautiful that i will be ordering more !
0	subway is always a great treat while out shopping , i love the fact that they have so much ingredients to choose from to make the perfect baguette !
0	items are always delivered fast and in unmarked packaging so you don_'_t have to feel embarrassed about collecting it from the postman !
0	play . com is the only online company that i trust to deliver cd '_s and dvd '_s .
0	they always have the best prices and a massive_selection to choose from .
0	delivery normally takes about 0_days unless you buy next_day delivery .
0	i recently bought my first set of contact_lenses from here , they were delivered next_day , just in time for my night out !
0	i will be buying from them again !
0	quite a lot of my clothing is from joe browns , i recently bought a coat in the sale , its brilliant .
0	great quality and nice a warm for the winter .
0	joe browns always has different_styles from any where else and always has something for every_occasion !
0	keep going joe browns !
0	powwownow makes conference calling with clients nationally and internationally simple and no_hassle .
0	the service is clever and simple , from the already set out email to the scheduler .
0	i much prefer it to other teleconference providers who make it more complicated and charge !
0	powwownow comes highly_recommended from my company .
0	i have given my scathing review of this company below , and it seems sooooooooooo many others were defrauded over the last few_days .
0	this may help everyone , i finally have a refund for these_cowboys on the way - 0000 000 0000 - that is their phone number .
0	option 0 - customer service .
0	i ended the call thanking them for ruining valentines for me and many others !
0	:-)
0	after purchasing a dress from this site , the dress arrived the very next_day , and i '_m from the u . s !
0	also , the packaging is beyond stunning , you ' re going to want to keep everything from the bow to the box , they ' re that beautiful .
0	the dress arrived carefully_packaged and i was immediately contacted by a customer_services rep to be sure i was happy with my purchase .
0	lovely place to do_business with !

0	really love this shop for its whole ethos and service .
0	i '_ve been regularly since i knew it existed , and have had one happy little_boy since in fun wellies and comfy shoes .
0	excellent practical advice is always given about extending shoes ' lives and making the right choices .
0	looking_forward to more hands - on play sessions as my son gets_older too , and perfect to have an_instant play_area inside for rainy days .
0	can '_t recommend more highly !
0	i received the printer i ordered promptly , although a kind neighbour came to my door to inform_me that it had arrived there the day before .
0	i hadn_'_t met my neighbour before , so it was a good job she was honest , otherwise i may never have seen my printer !
0	the printer works_fine , and so far i haven_'_t had to sample the aftersales service .
0	my item was exactly_what i told it would be .
0	it was in good condition and came wrapped in a whole load of bubble_wrap which_meant it was well_protected .
0	it came within two_days .
0	overall a great service , will definitely be ordering from them again .
0	would recommend to everyone .
0	i ordered an item from cash_generator and they use uk mail as their courier , the item came within two_days and was delivered at around 0pm which was perfect seeing as i knew i would be home at that time .
0	delivery man was pleasant , with a smile on his face even_though it was pouring down with rain .
0	i would 000_% recommend them .
0	i bought a groupon for a vax then placed the order online and it was delivered inside a week in perfect_condition .
0	would buy from here again .
0	orders arrived really quickly and really pleased with my order
0	i '_ve just received my second order with deramores .
0	unlike my first order , which arrived super quick in 0_days , this order went_awol .
0	the customer service team at deramores were fantastic , helping_me to try track my order and , when this didn_'_t work , resending another one asap .
0	i have no_doubt the non - delivery was from royal_mail '_s end ( as royal_mail almost botched the resend delivery with incorrectly dated delivery slips ) and can '_t thank deramores enough for their patience and fabulous service .
0	the products i ordered were all great quality and well priced , i '_ll be ordering again .
0	this is the first time i '_ve ever purchased designer_sunglasses online so it was a bit of a big deal and i needed a trusted website .
0	after_googling ' designer_sunglasses ' i came_across this site .
0	the reviews seemed good and they had the ray - bans i was looking for .
0	the price of the glasses themselves wasn_'_t the cheapest i came_across but postage was less_than what other_sites were charging .
0	i '_m_glad i chose this site a my gorgeous new sunglasses arrived within a couple of days in perfect_condition - thank_you !
0	item arrived in good time , cheap price , no_qualms !
0	great service .
0	was initially put off by a few bad_reviews but as one reviewer said it is the annoyed that usually feedback .
0	no_problems on this end though
0	i found this company to be appalling .
0	they delivered the lawn was a days late and despite scheduling and telephoning they still managed to miss the delivery window by 0 hours .
0	the lawn had glass embedded into the back in the soil , and when we unrolled it it was patched brown .
0	it died soon after .
0	no reponse from customer service , no offer of a refund despite complaints and certainly no refund of delivery .
0	appalling service from an appalling company .
0	avoid at all costs
0	i did wonder_how good things could be from here with the whole five_pound thing .
0	but after friends good reviews i decided to try it .
0	i wasn_'_t disappointed , delivery was fast , all the items were well made , and lovely .
0	very pleased , would happily_recommend to anyone .
0	wish i '_d found this site years_ago .
0	great service , fast delivery & brilliantly priced products .
0	i never normally complete reviews but am so happy with the service provided it '_s only fair to give credit to the technician & company .
0	ordered the tyre and booked a two hour_slot for fitting whilst at work the next_day .
0	chris , the technician arrived 0 minutes into the time_slot and had completed the job within 00_minutes .
0	he was polite and offered helpful advice on two other tyres which would need replacing in the near_future but didn_'_t push me to order at the time .
0	excellent and completely_hassle_free - will definitely be using tyres on the drive soon !
0	my home needed redecorating ; i was tired of doing it myself with my poor skills .
0	i called a few companies and found serviceteam , the account_manager i spoke to was very polite and helpful , they provided me with a reasonable_price , i was then informed the decorator could come and do the work in two_days .
0	the decorator managed to complete the work within_0days .
0	brilliant work i couldn ’_t judge more than that .
0	i can_honestly recommend these_guys to anyone ; they ’ re so quick with the service and excellent with the work .
0	my garden needs doing once the weather is clear and i know who i ’_m calling !
0	we ordered our dining furniture from them in february_0000 and where told that items would arrive at end of march_0000 .
0	unfortunately we where informed that there was a problem with the particular chairs ordered and would take a little_longer .
0	we where not informed of a new arrival date , but contacted them to find out that they were due in in a couple of days .
0	the delivery company ( branch of oakfurniture_land ) have also shown no respect or believe in customer service .
0	if you are unable to take delivery on the date they specify then you have to wait up to two_weeks to get a new delivery date which could mean you waiting another two_weeks .
0	00 weeks on we are still_waiting .
0	when we complained and asked for compensation for all the problems we have encountered we where told that they do not give out compensation .
0	they where also rather rude and disrespectful and obviously not familiar with customer_satisfaction .
0	when we said that we where fed_up and would like to cancel our order we where told that we would have to pay £_000 for return of goods from their delivery comany to their warehouse .
0	we would not recommend this company just on the basis of customer_care and satisfaction .
0	we have yet to see what the quality of the goods are like , but according to a number of reports read , we will not be holding our breaths .
0	i made an incorrect booking - ( okay my mistake ) but they wanted me to pay more than what i had paid for the ticket to alter the booking .
0	after i waited in a queue on the phone for over 00_minutes .
0	not good !
0	everything at super prices !
0	asda are the best for prices !
0	cant_beat their footie coverage !
0	super pizza !
0	got an online quote of £_000 for my toshiba and received my money on the friday after having my item collected on the monday , solid service .
0	this is a review of the terrible service after ordering mothers_day flowers .
0	i ordered these on friday the 00th of march and requested ( and paid more for ) delivery on sunday the 00th of march , mothers_day .
0	i paid 0 separate delivery charges due to ordering 0 separate bunches for my mother , grandmother and aunt .
0	well no flowers were delivered on mothers_day , or the day after ..... only my mother has received hers at 00pm today ( tues 0st april ).
0	and they are of poor quality , stems are wilted and dying , they weren_'_t even in water ?!?!?!?!
0	they had a damp_cloth around the bottom which is obviously not adequate or acceptable !
0	i have tried in vain to contact them to complain and try and get a refund of some description , but to no_avail .
0	0 separate calls to their helpline , which_resulted_in being held in queues for over 00_minutes at a time with no answer each time !
0	i also tried the live_chat on their website - no answer and kept expiring my query and logging me out ?!
0	i '_ve also emailed them , lets see if that is any more successful ......
0	overall extremely dissatisfied mothers_day flowers that just never came and when they did they were extremely poor quality .
0	i ordered a mobile phone from them , paid for it and received an_email_confirming my order .
0	i received an_email acknowledging m order and that its in progress .
0	not long after that , am told am being refunded .
0	no goods & up til now , no refund .
0	that was well over a month_ago .
0	no number to contact them & so was left to email them .
0	many emails & no answers .
0	do not order from them ever !
0	terrible company , terrible service .
0	it '_s very easy to order , great service and delivery was faster_than_expected .
0	got everything i ordered with satisfaction .
0	will recommend them .
0	definately be using them again ..!
0	i highly rate this company for their service .
0	i received emails during every process my order went through .
0	i was expecting my order to arrive post christmas , but got an_email_saying that its been fast - tracked to next_day delivery and ended_up getting it just before christmas .
0	i would highly_recommend this company to anyone looking for good delivery service as well as a good customer service .
0	kudos to you
0	never had a problem with this site always on time always well_packaged and good prices !
0	after an issue on thursday where we got our wires crossed about times we rebooked our appointment for tuesday ( 00th_july ) i received a call this morning saying that an engineer was available today ( 00th_july ) and would we like a quote .
0	as i was going to be home anyway i agreed .
0	less_than an_hour later nick g arrived .
0	he looked at the work we needed doing which was 0 large screen tvs to be wall_mounted in not the easiest of locations .
0	he provided a quote which was reasonable considering the work required and we decided to accept .
0	he provided us with the wall mounts and within an_hour and a half , both tvs were up and working .
0	nick was courteous and polite and a pleasure to have in the house unlike_some workman i have had to deal with in the past ( from different companies i might_add .)
0	i would certainly use this company again , in fact probably quite soon as our aerial is dated and could do with replacing so aerialforce will certainly be the first people i call for a quote .
0	i was dubious when i first found this website as it was offering me a wii u premium pack for £_000 . 00 , a good £_00 cheaper_than any where else .
0	i looked at several websites for reviews and 00_% were positive .
0	i decided as they except pay_pal as a method of payment to give them a go as this offered me protection .
0	i ordered my wii u just before 0pm and instantly received my confirmation e_- mail .
0	it stated that my item would be delivered in 0 - 0_days with the free delivery option i selected .
0	i then received another e_- mail_stating that my item would be delivered the next_day , and then another e_- mail giving me a 0hr delivery slot .
0	this was fantastic as i didn_'_t have to wait in all day for a courier to deliver .
0	it even told me my couriers name .
0	delivery day came and my item was delivered at the exact time they said it would and was well_packaged .
0	i will certainly be using this company again as they are far cheaper_than_anywhere_else and deliver really fast as well as keeping customers updated regards to their orders .
0	a fantastic , customer_focused company .
0	more places should operate like this .
0	my husband needed new work clothing and nightgear offered them at the best price around .
0	website was easy to navigate , goods came in time specified and we were kept_informed via_email of everything that was happening .
0	would reccomend and use again
0	bought a bra , and only after paying was i informed they didn_'_t have it in stock .
0	disappointing having to wait so long for it , as i wouldn_'_t have ordered it if i '_d known it was out of stock
0	i bought 0 items , at an amazing price , all in the sale too .
0	i then managed to find a discount_code for them .
0	the delivery was fast , and there was plenty of information how to track my stuff .
0	i ordered more items about 0_weeks_later , and forgot to use the discount_code , i called them up and they were more than happy to apply the discount_code , as you don_'_t actually charge the card until your items are dispatched .
0	i wouldn_'_t have any reservations to use this company again , brilliant on all accounts .
0	i love this website , but i despise most of the users .
0	reviews are great , but people are a lot more likely to review something with a negative_review than an honest or a balanced review .
0	it '_s great to find restaurants , hotels and activities , and i base every hotel i go to on the trip_advisor rating .
0	hostelbookers makes booking_hostels and cheap hotels so easy !
0	i had queries about a hostel that i was interested in so emailed them with my questions .
0	they responded quickly and contacted the hostel for me to find out the answers .
0	they were so professional in helping_me , it really took any stress of booking travel away !
0	great customer service .
0	last july took my car into halfords for a mot , failed on a few items was quoted £_000 for all the work done , which i agreed to .
0	took the car in the next_day ( a saturday ) for all the work to be carried_out .
0	heard_nothing all day phoned them at 0000 and said the car wasnt finished and they had to wait_till monday to get a tool , collected the car that evening and would returnit monday , was then charged_£_000 !!
0	only noticed after i had added my pin and asked why the sudden change in price .
0	said they had forgotten to add part of the work on when they quoted me !
0	i said that i felt that it was unacceptable and i would discuss it further on monday .
0	took the car back monday and they did give be a partial_refund for the difference , still cost me £_00 more than the original_quote .
0	again they had the car the whole day and again i had to phone .
0	fast forward 00months and 0000 miles and the wheel bearing they replaced needed_replacing again , so i took to a different halfords , part under warrenty which they replaced free of charge after trying to get me to puchase a £_000 exhaust ( which cost me £_000 else where !).
0	all fine again .
0	0_months later checking my car before its next mot , and noticed the the antiroll bar ( which was replace the year before ) was missing !!
0	that was re fitted else where .
0	and now just 0_months later the wheel bearing need replacing again !
0	!
0	taking it to a independent and will never use halfords .
0	nice product , very quick delivery , reasonable_price .
0	quick and easy to use booking service .
0	i would reccommed to everyone .
0	i '_ve_used the website for several purchases , and have always been happy with the products , the prices and the customer service .
0	i '_m_sure i will return in the future .
0	very happy with my products from planet_bake , all delivered as ordered and very speedy service .
0	would happily_recommend them .
0	great system that i didn_'_t have to print out any ticket or anything and really simple to use through facebook
0	this company is the best i have ever purchased from , they are highly efficient , the staff are more than happy to help you and respond to your emails and the delivery of my items has always arrived when i '_ve asked for it and very quick delivery , items are perfect , never had a problem with anything i have purchased from kitbag
0	i find bulk_powders an excellent website to order through .
0	i am rewarded frequently through offers available ( free delivery , free_samples , bulk offers , percentage_off products ).
0	i also benefit from collecting bp points which can be used to purchase next order .
0	theres a wide_range of products - all at excellent value for money and also good quality .
0	my products are always delivered when expected .
0	brilliant supplier !
0	i '_m not going to go into detail in regards to the experience i have had with this company as there have been 0 seperate_occasions and they are pretty similar to most peoples bad_experiences with them .
0	i would never order from this retailer again and i would advise people thinking of doing so to steer_clear .
0	they cannot deliver when stated and when extra is paid for prompt delivery they still can '_t deliver on time .
0	refunds take months to be credited back .
0	clothes are never good quality .
0	and the only way you can contact them is by email , and you literally have to pester them with non_stop emails in order to get a non - automated_reply .
0	definately not worth it .
0	i '_ve ordered a samsung mini 0 case and it arrived ( in italy ) in really short time !
0	the product quality did not disappoint me , it was just as i expect it to be !
0	i bought a rug and it was labled wrong as it was a runner so i asked for a different color no_problems there .
0	until .................................... we walked up the street and went in to our lettin agents stood talkin to the woman behind the counter and this fella stopeed my husband in the letting_agent and said ive bin told youve walked out with out paying for that rug could you come with me to sort it being infuriated i turned and told him he could wait his turn coz i had my own problem to sort_out finishe with the woman_who kept giving me funny looks and went to the store turns_out they didnt give us the right recipt there lucky the guy didnt get a smack in the teeth !
0	will never ever use argos again
0	i received great support from kathy . she helped_me quickly and was very polite . even on a chat you could tell she is a nice person .
0	code ec0000
0	i booked parking through looking0parking called svs parking stanstead and everything was fine with the drop_off but when our car was retururned we noticed some dents and scratches on it .
0	we told the driver and he said well at_least its drivable .
0	you have a smart phone right send a picture to my boss .
0	we did but after few rude emails and a text at 00 o ' clock it was clear they will not take any responsibility .
0	originally i emailed looking0parking to tell them i have a problem and rhey replied that somebody from svs will contact me because i have a contract with them but they monitor all the complaints to ensure they have the best vendors .
0	after everything that happened i emailed them all my emails with svs and all the complaints people shared on another review site and i never_heard back from them .
0	i do not think that they monitor the complaints at all .
0	otherwise they would not have such a company offered on their website .
0	company with so mani complaints , without_any contact information and any information at all about it anywhere .
0	also make_sure you look at their tc it says they do not take_responsibility for any damage of private property also that your car is parked at your_own_risk .
0	i do not think meet and greet would be only picking_up and droping off you car .
0	they should look after it too during this period .
0	ordered cycling_shorts and hockey glove .
0	very easy to order and quick delivery .
0	the memory checker was absolutly_brilliant .
0	i ordered some memory on a friday_afternoon and it arrived in the post saturday_morning so i think that the service was excellent .
0	thankyou vey much orca .
0	been using this service for around a year now and not once had a problem with it ( although i don_'_t use the hermes or tnt services offered as i haven_'_t had the best experiences with these in the past ).
0	the biggest advantage of interparcel is the prices .
0	it is so much_cheaper_than going directly to the companies and i '_ve saved_loads of money now i don_'_t have to book directly with tnt or other couriers .
0	one job tnt quoted £_00 to do when i called them but it was just £ 0ish on interparcel .
0	i always go for the interparcel standard or premium ( i think this is operated by ups ) and it is a very good service .
0	always here promptly the day after i book it or even on the same day if booked early enough and always_arrives the next_day .
0	also , if you put in the times you would like them to arrive to collect , they always seem to stick to it .
0	staff are friendly and helpful when i '_ve had to call and the drivers are all very efficient and friendly .
0	highly_recommended .
0	after having a nightmare experience with a similar company , i decided to give parcel0go a try .
0	due to issues caused by the other company ( booking the collection in , and then cancelling it saying they couldn_'_t deliver , only to collect the parcel which then went missing for 00_hours and was delivered to the customer damaged when it should have been returned to us ) i unfortunately had to first reschedule the collection , which was incredibly easy and just took a couple clicks on the website , and then to cancel the collection .
0	i did find it a little_confusing working out how to cancel a parcel and how to contact someone directly but did work it out in the end .
0	i spoke to emma on the live web help who had the collection cancelled in minutes .
0	very friendly and helpful customer service from emma and overall very satisfied with my experience of using parcel0go .
0	friendly service and i received my goods in excellent condition on the estimated day of arrival .
0	i received my order within the estimated time period and in excellent condition .
0	dress arrived very quickly considering it was made to measure .
0	dress felt very good quality .
0	looks perfect on .
0	had lots of complements .
0	good selection of cards , easy to upload_pics / text .. super_fast delivery in my experience ,.
0	having used chilli - sauce for my hen_weekend last_year with some minor_hiccups ; ( chilli - sauce didn_'_t confirm go karting numbers until last_minute even_though provisionally booked 0_months prior , so indoor go - karting became out - door as not enough karts at completely_different venue , * however they apologised and compensated ) i recommended them to a friend .
0	when my friend booked with chilli - sauce she specifically_requested the ibis hotel at explore lane bristol and we '_d stayed there on mine and loved how close it was to prism which was in our event .
0	however around 0_weeks prior we '_d discovered the ' rep ' had booked the ibis hotel at temple - meads .
0	the rep wouldn_'_t except responsibility and was adamant the hen didn_'_t request explore lane when we were all there that day and know she did .
0	we ended_up having to go to the travel_lodge hotel instead which alright was only 0 minutes_walk extra but the stress would '_ve been easily avoided if communication would '_ve been sent via_email soon as it was booked .
0	overall they did ' good '
0	this was my 0rd or fourth order with wg and what can i say , 000_% perfect .
0	love their products , our favourites are the half ham , chicken_breasts and our most favourite the meaty_pork_sausages .
0	the ham that i ordered with this order was very slightly underweight , however i was aware of this because prior to dispatch i received a phone_call to tell me and inform_me that the difference of price would be deducted - love the honesty there :) plus the best part was that i received a yummmmy parcel of fudge a couple of days_later as way of apology with a lovely hand_written card .
0	i hope my meat is underweight with each order in future ; 0 )
0	furthermore i had a code for free cumberland_sausages but we do not like them , so i cheekily asked to swap my freebies for the meaty ones , this was done with no_problems at all .
0	i highly_recommend them and will be returning to buy some more yummy meat , no more filling the pockets of shareholders at supermarket plc for me !
0	discovered iceland today , fantastic experience and was offered free home delivery - result i could go shopping in town and have a coffee and not worry_about frozen stuff defrosting :) will be returning again in the near_future .
0	buy all my work stuff from here and my boy '_s clothes - have bought them from newborn through to 00 - 00 and they have never disappointed :) bonus of next_day delivery .
0	have had the misfortune to visit primark on two occasions .
0	made the mistake of buying a t ' shirt - should have known better as it was only a couple of £'_s , washed on cold wash and shrunk on first wash . will now stick with fair_trade t '_s from sainsburys for £ 0 . 00 which was perfectly .
0	never had a problem with easyjet - always get me to spain with no_hiccups , booking is straight_forward and easy as is check in etc .
0	hate , hate time line , please bring back the traditional format or at_least let us choose !
0	i love amazon , i '_m a student and a kindle owner so use amazon at_least every other week for something or other , each time the transaction has_gone_smoothly and quickly with next_day delivery ( with amazon_prime , well_worth the money if you use amazon much ) would highly_recommend them .
0	i '_ve been a member of moneysavingexpert . com for the last 0 years , spending an inordinate amount of time in the various_forums on offer - they have proved to be invaluable over the years , particularly the old style forum :) i also get martin '_s weekly email and again have saved and gained so much from it over the years .
0	quick , easy and efficient , the return bag arrived and cheque arrived promptly .
0	no_fuss , totally recommended .
0	got my post bag , sent it off using the freepost .
0	the next_day ( approx 00hrs_later ) i had a email to say it had been processed then 0mins later - order complete .. i couldnt_believe_how quick it was !
0	i chose the fast payment bank_transfer and the money was in my bank after 0_hr 00mins from the email .
0	im am a very happy customer and would use this service over and over again !
0	wooooooooooooooo
0	har inget att klaga på , allt är skött exemplariskt !
0	snabb frakt , bra paketerat och riktigt bra_priser !
0	kommer handla här flera gånger igen :) tack !
0	i used shiply looking to transport a sofa i bought and the offers came straight_away .
0	it '_s so easy to use & the email_notifications meant i was quick to choose the most affordable transporter .
0	great site

0	like you i know , what it truly takes to get an o .
0	what a company !
0	remaining aligned with the original founders vision , this company has recently partnered with wallgreens .
0	all they need to do is update their website with more products and give the consumer a longer time to order during the day to be accepted for next_day delivery !
0	once this is done , they need to create an application for the phones which creates more buying and review power for them !!!
0	!
0	easier than ebay and amazon , this trading site is cool , modern and easily_navigable !
0	i love the style and the vision for the company !
0	the ceo has a beautiful vision for it and i can see it growing massively internationally !
0	placed an order for a north_face backpack earlier today - opted for the free delivery so was initially informed order would arrive before 00th_june , but i '_ve already had confirmation of its dispatch - so it should now arrive in time for my boyfriend '_s birthday - with no delivery charges !
0	and it was the cheapest price online i could find for the same bag .
0	many_thanks , webtogs .

0	i don_'_t think any of them actually know what they ' re doing !
0	after going to fourways garage to get my car ' fixed ' i '_ve had endless problems with my car .
0	i '_ve taken it to 0 different garages since and all say that this garage has done something seriously wrong !
0	i took my car back to this garage and they patronized me , not believing a word i said .
0	finally after getting a man to talk to them they took the car .
0	i had a courtesy car ( which was very dangerous to drive , dodgy clutch and brakes !)
0	and a little down the road i pulled over to fix my seat position and i see 0 of the guys from the garage speeding past me in my car !
0	so i followed them , they were going 00mph in a 00 !
0	then they went 00mph round a corner !
0	i have a very large car and cant take corners !
0	i saw and smelt burning rubber from my brand_new tyres ,
0	there '_s an unbelievable amount of negative things i have to say about this appalling place but i don_'_t want to waste more time on them .
0	i know of a company that use fourways garage , and they have endless problems with their cars , they are always worse when they come_back but they ' re tied_into a contract .
0	so i know that its not just me .
0	please_avoid !
0	my cars still not fixed and i now have to buy a new one after what they '_ve done !
0	ordered our samsung 0d_tv on friday 00th_jan ( when we had 00 inches of snow !)
0	crampton and moore were the cheapest plus free delivery .
0	within 0 minutes i had a conformation_email_saying its about to be dispatched and what day it will be delivered !
0	i was in a little disbelief at how fast it was all happening , however monday 00st_jan my television turned_up - before_lunch as well !
0	easy to use website , cheapest on the web by far , free and fast delivery .
0	easy access to lots of information .
0	everything you need and want when ordering a pricey item .
0	i am extremely happy to have located a site that matches reasonable pricing with ease of use .
0	i will most certainly advise patients and friends to visit the site and reap the benefits of easy access !
0	placed an order with garden best_buys .
0	over a week_later , i '_d had no communication from them ( apart_from a ' rate your experience ' email , ironically ).
0	i emailed to ask if my order had been dispatched , and when i might expect to receive it .
0	only then was i informed that the item was out of stock , and offered a refund .
0	in fairness , the customer service was good once i got in touch , and the refund was given immediately .
0	but the fact that the plant was out of stock , and i received no notification until i chased the order was disappointing .
0	we just bought chip - board flooring for our loft_conversion from wickes .
0	researched the product online and wickes offered the best value .
0	item is classed_as ' big and bulky ' but was still next_day delivery .
0	ordered online yesterday_afternoon and reveived immediate_confirmation by email .
0	within an_hour , wickes had rung to confirm the order and check we wanted delivery the next_day .
0	they rang again a few hours_later to confirm the time we could expect delivery .
0	the delivery arrived promptly this morning , as agreed , and i was very impressed by the speed it arrived from ordering to arrival , especially as it was a bulky order .
0	i was also very impressed with the communication as we were kept well informed at every_stage .
0	we have also bought all our radiators and plumbing from wickes ( in store ) as well as our bathroom_suite and always found them to be good value and good quality .
0	they are very good for trade goods and basic diy equipment , as long as you don_'_t require anything too fancy .
0	never had any problem exchanging goods either , even outside of receipt .
0	although the value seems good , i have rarely experienced_such a slow service .
0	bought an item which ' usually ships in 0 - 0 business days .'
0	payment was taken immediately , but it was not dispatched for 0_days , and even then , only when i chased it .
0	the item had to be returned , and telephone_calls took too long to answer .
0	each email i sent received an_automated_response stating ' we will answer your query within 0 business day .'
0	this was never the case .
0	responses always took significantly longer , and i had to chase for each and every_step of the refund while they dragged their feet .
0	the refund took over a month to be reinstated , and had to be chased up at every_stage .
0	unfortunately , the low price does not make up for the extremely slow service which requires more effort than it is worth to get a response .
0	i would never use this company again .
0	( they also made it incredibly difficult to submit this review !)
0	was recommended this site as never_heard of it and il deff b using it again .
0	i spoke with stephane this evening to help me find where my local drop_off points are , she was quick and effective in answer all my questions .
0	also provided with the closest pick_up point for the person receiving gift too .
0	fantastic service .
0	thankyou
0	the prices are sometimes cheaper_than elsewhere but can cause hassle , shipping times can be good or very poor .
0	i found that i couldn_'_t save items to my basket which was so annoying when i wanted to order something later , also i believe they don_'_t have a paypal option which causes hassle and made me feel unsafe .
0	excellent way to save your details and pay quickly without hassle , makes you feel safe when ordering online .
0	the site itself is a good idea and reasonably easy to navigate after a while however the constant changes with lack of respect for what the users want is disgraceful .
0	especially with the new ' timeline ' major changes that affect the users are forced upon them and make the site confusing and annoying however it is still a good place to connect to friends you can '_t see in person a lot .
0	recently placed my first order from here and it arrived promptly despite_being an overseas shipping .
0	the order was packaged beautifully ( and was delightfully cheap .)
0	the quality of the items was superb and customer service ( had a little problem with one item ) was amazing , i was told to discard the faulty item and a new one was sent as soon as possible , no questions_asked .
0	although the website is a little hard to navigate and the pictures are not the best quality the clothing and items are very nice when received .
0	my order was a little delayed however nothing major .
0	some of the sizing can come up a little weird ( ever when measured by their size_guide ) however the quality is good .
0	ordering from this site is a pleasure , everything is clear , precise , organised ( and pretty !)
0	items are dispatched very quickly and arrive swiftly .
0	never had any trouble with my orders and enquiries are replied to promptly .
0	always found this site to be the cheapest when comparing something i want to purchase and they are packaged perfectly .
0	i fully recommend them to anyone ( in fact i have .)
0	no_problems getting the tickets , it was easy to use , easy to follow .
0	i got the tickets a week before the show , and had no_worries_about them not being real , as there were guaranteed byt get me in .
0	an easy way to get tickets !
0	such a great and interesting idea for a gift !
0	a true original , and so much fun !
0	great service , easy to order , and it arrived quickly .
0	bought it to make a gift for a friend .
0	it was easy to use , and arrived quickly .
0	once we had it , it was very well_done , a lovely gift idea !
0	this photobook i purchased was absolutely_brilliant ..
0	the quality is just fantastic first_class ..
0	if i ever need another photobook then i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to purchase from photoworld .
0	very happy !

0	for many_years , i bought my supplements from gnc .
0	i thought i was getting a " good " deal .
0	i even had their membership card and frequently bought from their deal of the day / month .
0	even with all the discounts & membership card applied , i just knew i was getting the best deals around .
0	until , i came_across this website .
0	i was just eagerly searching the web for cheap supplements , because i felt like their had to be better deals out there somewhere .
0	i clicked on the link and searched for my supplements , and they are nearly 0 / 0 the price of what i was paying gnc and that was with my gold card .
0	and , better yet if you find the supplement you are interested in for cheaper on another site , they will even price match it for you .
0	i was so shocked that i thought this was a scam , i searched for reviews to see if the website was legit , and it appeared to be .
0	it is an easy process and you get plenty of deals / freebies with your purchases .
0	i always feel like a kid in a candy_store when i shop_here .
0	and , what '_s better_than having christmas all year round , everyday , 00 / 0 !
0	i get so excited to see my package at my door waiting for me :) i love their products & prices !!
0	they are great and would recommend them to anyone .
0	as i am always in a rush i have put the addresses for collection and delivery the wrong way round .
0	using parcels0go '_s webchat i chatted with dianne who came online instantly , and understood my error and rectified it straight_away .
0	a confirmation was sent for peace of mind and when the tracking was not working i web chatted to adam who confirmed the right addresses and gave_me the right tracking_number .
0	polite , professional and quick .
0	thank_you dianne & adam
0	we found flashbay when one of our other_suppliers was unable to accomodate our deadline for a management conference .
0	a quick call to flashbay and conversation with an account_manager and we had an competitive ( even cheaper ) quote which would be available when we needed it .
0	we were kept very informed_throughout the entire_process and the flash drivers look amazing .
0	we are very happy with the service and will using flasbay again !
0	no consistency with luggage_allowance , you could take 0 bags out from england but then staff over in spain completely over the top and unreasonable only one bag on the way back , which is fine but you need to make it the same each way .
0	crap company .
0	fly with british_airways !
0	!
0	lovely staff , easy to use website .
0	great value .
0	very fast receipt of return post bag ( next_day ), i then sent the phone back next_day and the money was in my account the next afternoon .
0	fantastic !!
0	!
0	i can '_t_believe the response i got and how fast the email replies were , i '_ve never_experienced_such amazing customer service , thank_you so much i will_defo recommend to any0 wanting to buy from this site .
0	highly_recommend service was excellent and was kept_updated all the time .
0	beautiful flowers too and excellent value for money !
0	excellent service and product of excellent quality would definitely purchase again from oak_furniture_land !
0	!
0	i love their t - shirts and their standard of service is excellent :)
0	they have made it very easy to sell your phone , plus the ease of receiving the money quickly !

0	my boyfriend brought me tickets for my birthday for rebecca ferguson at the theatre royal on tuesday 00th_march such a lovely surprise !!
0	i had a little letter in with my tickets to leave a review & i have as we were both happy with our double eight experience .
0	we have recommended them to friends :)
0	this was the first time i have booked with hostelbookers . com and i was impressed at the ease of booking .
0	the price for the same hostel was cheaper on this site than another hostel website and they didn_'_t charge a booking_fee .
0	i will definitely use the site again .
0	great variety of hotels and hostels on an easy to use website .
0	the site is very regularly_updated by knowledgeable travellers and locals .
0	i used a comparison site to see where i could get the most for for my unwanted_phones , one came up with double what all others were saying .
0	i almost sent everything to them then thought i '_ll check trust_pilot for reviews i '_m_glad i did .
0	none of the reviews were good , all where people who had sent the phones but no money and no contact .
0	however when i checked for mazuma it was the complete_opposite and every review was 0 or 0_stars so without_reservation i filled in the details and sent off my phone once i received the pack .
0	this was over christmas , they messaged me to say they had received my phone the day after boxing_day and i received my funds the same day , exactly as they quoted .
0	will definitely use in future and recommend to others .
0	i bought a variety of different products to help me with training for the marathon .
0	i '_m not an_avid supplement user , but i have used a few in the past .
0	whey_protein ( strawberry ) - this is the best protein i have ever_tasted !
0	no chalkiness , or that slightly weird taste ( if you know what i mean ?).
0	i take mine with milk - using the shaker they sell ( which is really good btw !)
0	and it is outstanding .
0	l glutamine - started_taking this three_times a day .
0	i mix mine with green_tea extract in a mug of hot_water ( kills two birds with one stone ?)
0	and it '_s fine .
0	probably absolutely tasteless with juice , but with green_tea it '_s acceptable .
0	it '_s not undrinkable but it '_s not something i happily sip on .
0	omega fish_oil caps - take two with breakfast , lunch and dinner .
0	easy to take and will definitely re - stock once i run_out .
0	shaker - i prefer this style as it hasn_'_t got one of those metal wire ball mixers .
0	this uses a grid insert , does the job really well and makes the whey_protein seem like a milkshake .
0	overall , quality products and the cheapest i could find .
0	combined with wowcherching cashback , how can you go_wrong ?
0	ideal for presents to loved ones and yourself !
0	cheap quality products that will be in your hands ready to play with quickly !
0	the perfect online_retailer :_d
0	very very happy , this sideboard was exactly_what i wanted , just took_ages to get it !!!
0	however pine_solutions kept me informed every couple of weeks by email that my order was still on target :-)
0	the delivery company were a bit different on service in the fact that they were paid to bring it in and place it , and they wanted to dump it in the hallway and go , i wanted it in the dining_room so told them and they were not too pleased but did it !
0	the order was delivered to the wrong_address after delivery address was confirmed , went to our office 000_miles_away from our head_office .
0	ordered badge covers and gave specific details on what size was required - wrong_size sent , this was because i had said the order was urgent so they sent what they had in stock rather_than what i needed .
0	order was also incorrect as to the style !
0	having_difficulty now trying to get the correct order to be sent out and trying to get details of manager to speak to regarding my complaint .
0	i usually buy nail_polish from beauty_bay and the selection of o . p . i nail_polish is amazing not to mention the cheap prices and the regular running discount_codes which help me get amazing beauty bargains .
0	orders have always arrived quickly , and that '_s on super_saver delivery , they '_ve been well_packaged and i '_ve especially appreciated all the care that was taken to preserve all my nail_polishes on their way to me .
0	beauty_bay also offers and amazing range of other beauty products and their prices and good service you really can '_t beat !
0	it '_s definitely my go - to site for all my beauty needs !
0	this was an easy to use no_hidden_fees site !
0	wonderful !
0	ordered the flowers for a work_colleague and she was absolutely_delighted .
0	said they were beautiful and made her day .
0	service was quick and hassle_free and was pleased with the email_updates on despatch and delivery confirmation .
0	i was recommended away0 by a friend in manchester .
0	keep in mind i am travelling from london .
0	i spent months looking through different ( pushy !)
0	agents to book a holiday for my boyfriend and i to go to ny and vegas - it was a surprise trip and i had never been before , so on top of being a nervous and anxious person , i was doing it all alone !
0	stressful !
0	!
0	nothing was too much for the team , and having changed my mind back and forth ( over 00 + times !
0	), they still helped_me out , were not pushy at all and kept giving me the best options at the most_economical price .
0	best part , was they put no_pressure on me to ' hurry ' before prices changed .
0	they held what they could and have booked me the most exciting trip for my boyfriend and me !
0	highly_recommend and will_continue to use them :-)
0	the hen_weekend was fantastic !
0	we went to newcastle and stayed in the holiday_inn express metro - a bit further out than the city_centre , but we got free bubbly and a free taxi for the group into_town .
0	the friday_night entertainment was at a comedy_club , this included a two course_meal - great value for money as there was even steak on the menu !!!
0	the night included free entry into the club next to the comedy_club - we stayed there and partied all night , with much fun had by all !!!
0	the saturday was spent at the hilton_hotel for a spa day , much needed as we were all feeling worse for wear !
0	we then got our glad rags back on for a cocktail_making evening at revolutions ; again this included a great two course_meal !
0	the evening was such fun and we had soooo_much free booze !
0	the weekend was easy to book and involved little hassle with payments , etc !
0	i would recommend to anyone !
0	great next_day service , had money in my account within_00hrs of recieving my phone .
0	no_complaints , ran_smoothly , recommended to all !!
0	!
0	i made my order and it came in good time , i also had to change one of the items and this was done efficiently and promptly over the phone .
0	the changed item arrived and was exactly_what i wanted .
0	also the other items i ordered were very good quality .
0	thank_you :)

0	hostelbookers sale made it better value , it was very easy and no booking_fees
0	have used hostelbookers multiple_times to book accommodation .
0	always great value and fantastic customer service .
0	having found the watch i wanted on the website , a tag series 0000 , it was a relatively quick , painless_procedure to obtain .
0	what was so impressive about watchfinder is the card i originally used to pay for my watch had to be replaced due to watchfinders own security_measures , for them and myself i add , but dealing_with tom through e_- mail and phone i had a number of satisfactory options to proceed with .
0	fantastic for any company to have a back up plan b , c and even d in place .
0	card refunded almost_immediately , tom calling me to let_me know and also e_-_mails when my new purchase was through put my mind at ease somewhat .
0	professional , curteous and polite was how i could describe the transaction .
0	now to the watch .
0	just fantastic to open the well_packaged box to find all original paperwork , original receipts , original guarantee with serial_numbers and the watch itself in fantastic second_hand condition .
0	i ( and my nosey neighbour stood beside me ) were simply bowled away at the marvellous condition .
0	rang tom and asked for 0 more links , having broken my wrist twice i needed some extra room , not a problem !
0	0 being shipped to me almost_immediately .
0	thanks tom and thankyou watchfinder .
0	i will purchase again and recommend .
0	great selection of great products and a lot of hard to find products in one place
0	my husband forgot some important items for a buisness trip and emma was not only friendly but also very helpful and helped_me to choose the right service for us .
0	i am very impressed with the service and will be using it again .
0	thank_you emma - crisis averted !
0	i ordered a couple of magnet sets , after having ordered them from another company and they arrived bent and unusable .
0	i was a little_worried therefore about ordering more , but i needn_'_t have been - it was really easy to order from grindstore , the sets were actually cheaper and they arrived next_day in suitable packaging and perfect_condition .
0	would happily_recommend to all .
0	excellent price and fast service , would use again
0	get good product for an amazing price !
0	great service and speedy delivery :)
0	i use amazon quite frequently .. always find what i want and find prices pretty reasonable .
0	google for me everytime , without a doubt
0	brilliant and quick service .
0	i highly_recommend using mazuma if you ' re considering selling your mobile and you want dosh quick :) happy
0	my family is spread across three continents , which means i have to take long international flights several_times , if not more , every year .
0	i used to use expedia for all my bookings , but my friend suggested i try using flight_network , as the flights are often cheaper .
0	i needed to book a one way flight from vancouver to london , and decided to try using flight_network for the first time ( with the intention that if the experience is decent , i would continue using my account on the website for all future_bookings ).
0	i booked a virgin_atlantic flight for september 00th , for a very decent price , only to find out less_than a month later that my sister is quite ill and i need to go to london earlier to help her with her big move .
0	i made a long_distance call to flight_network from my parents ' home in asia , and was put on hold for a long time .
0	i was getting impatient , as the call was costing me quite a lot of money already , only to be greeted_by a rather rude customer representative named james .
0	i explained to him that i would like to change my flight date from the 00th to the 00th , and he then took another five_minutes to find out what the fare rules were .
0	he told me that the fee for changing was 000_dollars plus the fare difference , which amounted to almost 0000 dollars !!!!
0	i asked him where the 000_dollars were coming from , and he could not explain this clearly .
0	i was checking on the flight_network website the cost of the flight on the 00th , and it stated that there was a seat left , going at 000_dollars , which would mean the difference would be around 000_dollars , not 0000 .
0	i pointed this out , and he rather rudely_told me to send him a screen_shot ( which i found rather ridiculous - why would i lie about this , when i '_m on the flight_network website ?
0	), which i did so promptly .
0	he then told me because the change is done " manually ", for some reason , he cant see the fare of 000_dollars ... and then he tried to justify the 0000 dollar fare difference by saying that the 000 dollar price quote " expired " as there is only one seat left and someone_else bought it ... which was clearly untrue as i checked again after the call , and i could make the purchase of that ticket .
0	i felt like he was coming up with any excuse to charge me more for the change .
0	i then asked him about a cancellation , at which point he said the same fee of 000_dollars apply .
0	once again , he did not provide any coherent explanation of where this number comes from .
0	having studied law , this sort of inconsistent , unjustified , and incompetent service frustrated me more than anything_else - i then asked him about a possible travel credit , and whether that was valid under the terms and conditions , and i did not get the sense that he knew them well at all .
0	he did not give me a clear answer and directed me to call virgin_atlantic directly ( oh great , another expensive long_distance call !
0	).
0	i then spent another 00_minutes on the phone calling virgin_atlantic , who then told me that they could not do anything as i made the reservation with flight_network , and that the agent should know all the details about the fare rules , including travel credit refunds .
0	if virgin_atlantic could actually give me the answer i needed , i wouldnt mind having spent who_knows_how much on making the long_distance call , but it turned_out that the agent should have known in the first place !
0	fed_up with the whole situation , i then called flight_network again , and this time , service was even slower .
0	i dont even remember how long i was put on hold for ( and keeping in mind this is at 0am my time in asia ...).
0	i was served by a girl named kris , who was admittedly much more professional .
0	i asked her about the change and cancellation , as well as a possible flight credit , and she replied after a long wait that i couldnt get a travel credit ( i wish james would have told me this before i wasted so much time and money ).
0	she then informed me that the change fee is 000 ( which is clearly overpriced according to the other reviews i read and the research i did online regarding virgin flights ...), and the cancellation_fee is 000 .
0	i was clearly skeptical for two reasons_: 0 ) most of the things i read online about changing virgin flights was that the change fee is around 00 pounds or 00 dollars ... not 000 .
0	0 ) so then i asked who levied this hefty sum - flight_network or virgin .
0	she replied virgin .
0	she then explained that the penalties are applied in two ways - 00 charged to my card and 000 deducted from the refund .
0	this struck me as odd - this doesnt make_sense if the penalties are all levied by one party .
0	she then changed her answer and said the 00 is levied by flight_network as a service fee .
0	i was clearly unimpressed by the flip - flopping of answers .
0	i asked her kindly if there was any way she could waive this fee by speaking to her manager , and without actually speaking to her manager ( which would have at_least made me feel better ), she said this is the best her manager can do , and that this fee of 000 is a one time offer - if i call back , i will get charged 000 , which is the actual penalty fee ( but i thought this was 000 , according to james ?!!)
0	i understand flight change and cancellation_fees can be expensive , but the least i ask for is consistency .
0	i even asked kris if she would be willing to waive the fee if i book my new flight on the 00th ( and since i '_m travelling with 0 other people in my family , this would be several thousand $$$ worth of tickets ) with flight_network , and she said no ( once again , without_consulting her manager ).
0	i ended_up paying the 000_dollars to cancel my flight .
0	i feel bitter , confused , and cheated out of my money .
0	i didnt get a clear answer from any of these customer service representatives as to where these random figures - 000 , 000 , 000 come from - supposedly a book of " fare rules "... but surely if they use the same book , they wouldnt give me different numbers every time .
0	also , they just wasted too much of my valuable time and money spent on long_distance calls - that '_s another thing to add onto the 000_dollars wasted .
0	i was honestly looking_forward to booking my flights with flight_network .
0	as someone_else said on this website , flight_network seems to lure you with the cheap prices , and once you buy them , you ' re trapped with bad customer service ... the way they run their business - bartering the change fees with customers , and trying to squeeze hefty sums ( which isnt much less_than the flight ticket itself ) from them - is just disappointing .
0	i '_d rather pay the additional_fee that expedia levies on booking the flights for the better customer service i used to get there .
0	i have received a controller on two_separate_occasions from gamermodz and both_times , there has not been a single issue .
0	i have received the controller in 0_days , from the date of the order going through - this is us to uk shipping also , so over the moon with that .
0	the controllers themselves have looked as good as i had hoped and also worked as they should .
0	i did have an issue with the first controller but because of the fast reply from customer service ( very quick and professional response ), i found out that the fault was mine for using a rechargeable_battery pack that wasn_'_t powerful enough to power the controller .
0	having the printed out instructions included in the box also helped_me to get up and running quicker_than i had hoped , also .
0	i would recommend gamermodz and their products to anyone who_asks me where they should go for a custom controller !
0	the ordering process for creating your_own custom skin or case is very straightforward .
0	the prices are very reasonable and delivery time is a day or two , at the most .
0	the quality of the skins and cases that i have received previously from wrappz has_been very high and they turn out exactly how you expect them to when designing on the site .
0	they also cater for a very large range of products !
0	high recommendations from myself !
0	item arrived as_described and very promptly indeed .
0	nice website , easy to navigate and not at all scary looking , liked that it was designed for women .
0	having stumbled_upon marlows_diamonds when browsing for engagement_rings , we were blown_away by the service we received .
0	margaret , our sales_representative , listened to what we were looking for and really helped_us narrow_down our search until we found the most perfect ring .
0	not only were we helped to find what we were looking for , we were also fully_informed of the grading scale so we could appreciate the quality of our purchase .
0	the prices are unbeatable too !!!
0	if you only have time to visit one store in the jewellery_quarter then make_sure it '_s marlows !
0	a truly_memorable experience !
0	thanks margaret and the team :) rachael and paul 0 . 00 . 0000
0	i finally found the product i wanted that was actually in stock at this website !
0	i was so excited to come_across my supplement at such an awesome price that would also be shipped quickly .
0	it took a lot of pressure off of me thinking i would have to buy a different product that i knew i wouldn_'_t be as pleased with .
0	i recently_moved to the mid - west from the east_coast , and the stores out here carry different products .
0	a huge weight was lifted knowing i can_rely_on this site to meet my , and my muscles , needs !!!
0	kudos !!!
0	and thank_you truly !
0	i always buy from amazon if i can due to the ease of use and great prices .
0	it was a big decision to have laser_eye_surgery , but i am extremely glad that i did it .
0	although i had to have lasek treatment , ( i wanted lasik ), and this left me with fairly severe discomfort for two_days , and unable to drive for two_weeks , it was entirely worth it .
0	life without contact_lenses is fabulous !
0	swimming , camping , flying , napping (!)...
0	all things that were not easy to do with contact_lenses and now they can be done with no_issues at all .
0	optimax were friendly , welcoming and professional .
0	they have looked after me really well , and still ( a year on ) have not fully discharged me - they will keep seeing you until you are completely healed .
0	i would recommend them to anyone .
0	always great prices and interesting things to do .
0	saves a lot ofhard work searching for deals
0	the site helps me have awesome holidays i would not have had without expedia .
0	thank_you !
0	loved the humour on the site , got my awesome vibrator when i needed it .
0	good customer service .
0	they were very quick to respond to my e_- mail .
0	we have placed 0 orders with flashbay to date .
0	both_times we have dealt_with mark_williams , he has_been extremely_helpful and efficient .
0	we would highly_recommend flashbay to others !
0	we worked with karen to get christmas cards to send out to all our club members and other clubs .
0	we had quite a specific design in mind as we have our club mascot and club colours we wanted to incorporate and karen took this all on board and designed it exactly to what we were looking for .
0	not only that but we found her very approachable and great to work with , a talented designer !
0	due to the great job_done on the cards we have come_back to use karen at printing . com again when organising our fundraising ceilidh , so thank_you again !
0	it '_s nearly 0000 , ao . com promises to be one of the leading ecommerce retailers for electronic goods we have ever known , a humorous tv campaign , great website , product range and price match_promise .. all fantastic but you cant cancel your orders on - line ... you have to call an 0000 number to be able to amend or cancel your order .
0	seems a bit underhanded and defeats the whole purpose of shopping on - line , having freedom and flexibility to control my purchases .
0	i gave ao . com a shot , but it '_s back to amazon for me where the items are cheaper and i have an account where i can submit questions and cancel orders at my convenience .
0	i am now on my 0rd day waiting for my next_day delivery .
0	driver has_been proven to be lying , saying he couldn_'_t gain_access to the property (... there are no access issues ) and his gps showed he had been nowhere_near my post_code !
0	counting_down the days until yodel goes bust , hopefully sooner rather_than later .
0	yodel , you should down right ashamed at how your company operates !
0	my save the date cards arrived today im so pleased with them , fast delivery and excellent quality .
0	i cant_wait to order my invites now .
0	i '_m happy with this site
0	i phoned accident advice helpline to find out if i could be eligible to claim for a minor incident .
0	the person on the phone was very helpful , professional and my claim has just been accepted .
0	despite assuring_me that prestige_flowers could deliver on mothering_sunday , i chose them as a flower delivery company because of this .
0	i then paid for them to deliver on the sunday , happy that this would be met by htem as they had specifically advertised mothers_day flowers .
0	to my horror , the flowers were actually delivered a day early and ruined my surprise completely .
0	prestige_flowers used royal_mail to deliver the flowers , not a particular courier so it wasn_'_t surprisingly they didn_'_t deliver on a sunday !
0	i then wrote to prestige_flowers explaining my upset and reminding them that their website states 000_% satisfaction_guaranteed which i was not .
0	the reply i received was most_unhelpful and i was offered no consolation or attempts to keep me 000_% satisfied which is a guarantee they pride_themselves on .
0	after further e_mails from my part i was eventually offered a measly_£ 0 off my next purchase with them .
0	i will never use their awful service again and urge you to do the same .
0	all you have to do is a web search of the company and read the plethora of negative_reviews !
0	i went looking for a mrp and found the lean body hi protein milkshake for 00 . 00 a container alomst a third of the price .
0	went to checkout and found a bunch of free stuff that looked like it could help as well .
0	love this place
0	just started shopping here , but the prices are the best compared to other_sites that i have browsed .
0	the flat rate shipping is great for larger orders .
0	my only_complaint would be the layout of the site makes it seem like its not very professional or legit , but if that is what keeps the prices low , i guess i can deal with that .
0	they have everything you need to know : location , availability , price , important amenities , and tonnes of reviews by previous guests .
0	first of all , sophie is great with social - networking because this gives the company a very close and friendly laid - back vibe .
0	i also love the no booking_fees and the rates are slightly cheaper_than any other hostel booking sites .
0	( i '_ve done the research ).
0	thank_you again .
0	communication was excellent & friendly , item arrived within the window i was told it would & in perfect_condition .
0	would definitely use again : )
0	no_problems .
0	certainly cheaper_than high_street
0	we had a photographer for a college musical production pull out on us at literally the last_minute .
0	one quick phone_call and lanford guest were there and they took kickass photos .
0	i '_m in love with the whole set of shots !
0	also did really fabulous photos of our graduation ball .
0	the prices are much more reasonable than other photogs as well , which is huge when you ' re a poor , vain person like me who just wants some photos of yourself looking hot without giving away an arm and a leg .
0	it '_s rare_nowadays to get all three of the above from a website !
0	i use review sites a lot but very , very rarely_write any myself .
0	however the service i have just received from character . com has_been so excellent , i knew i had to do my bit ...
0	i recently ordered a set of kids disney cars pj '_s and two rucksacks .
0	the price was so reasonable ( dare i say cheap ?)
0	i was fully expecting them to be either dodgy quality or to be left waiting weeks for them to arrive .
0	i was surprised to be proved wrong on both_counts .
0	i have already given the enclosed flyer to a friend and recommended the site to my sister - in - law for future_purchases .
0	so a big thanks and well_done to character . com .
0	i shall definitely be back !
0	good service
0	really pleased with item reasonably_priced , came really quick + arrived in perfect_condition well_packaged would defo buy from cheapsmells again would recommend them good variety of items on website thanks again
0	i bought a ecommerce package . my website was done perfectly just the way i wanted it , anuj build my web perfect he is a good developer to deal with , he is so humble and professional , i give him 00 out 00 i '_m so happy and thank_you so much anuj . i recommend webcreationuk to everyone their customer support_team are excellent especially jose he was nice to me , he help choose the right domain for my site ,
0	i have been customer to this company for years although their prices are good i have to admit their cigs is useless
0	ordered myself some skis that i found to be the best price online and i looked for about 0_weeks , everywhere online ( i '_m a savvy online shopper !)
0	- delivery was super quick and had incredible dhl delivery service with frequent_updates on delivery time ( right up to the hour of estimated delivery !)
0	- and amazingly , could track my driver with a ( gps or similar ?)
0	tracking service which showed me a map of where my driver was on his route ... amazing !
0	very happy with my first order , will be one of many to come .
0	i '_ve ordered from bodyjewelleryshop once so far , and so far have found an excellent service with order received next_day , although they did have a cut_off point so i had to call up to make_sure my order was being sent out the same day .
0	the lady on the phone was kind enough to make_sure my order went through even_though i had just missed the cut_off point !
0	:) i give them 0_stars because of that customer service , and the jewellery on their website is a really good selection i thought .
0	i haven_'_t joined the forums yet but have had a browse and it seems they have a really nice community , but have yet to find out more about that .
0	fully recommend them from what i have had so far ...
0	i have just been speaking to sarah_hayes on live_chat from parcel0go about an issue i had with a parcel , she has kindly rebooked with another courier for me and was very helpful .
0	thank_you and well_done for the customer service .
0	goods were delivered within timescale .
0	no_hassle purchase .
0	will_definately buy from them again .
0	i would recommend beautybay to everyone ; the shipping is fast , free and i had absolutely no_problems .
0	they often have brands that are hard to find and a lot of the time the prices are better_than most online_retailers .
0	i wanted to send some parcels with parcel0go but was unsure as to how to go about it .
0	i opened a customer chat box and received outstanding and friendly advice from catherine_corless .
0	i now know everything i need to do before sending my packages .
0	so , again thank_you .
0	i ripped all my cds before sending off .
0	i know for a fact that they were all in great condition and all played perfectly .
0	they said they were all heavily scratched , did not accept them and did not pay for them .
0	i said the same day that they could post them back and i would pay the postagee , they said it was too late they '_d already been recycled .
0	joke !
0	they have had cds for free , i will not be using them again .
0	excellent and quick service !
0	especially pleased over the live_chat where you can chat with staff directly to get help immediately .
0	helpful staff not to mention competitive_prices .
0	recommended to others and will_continue doing so .
0	very efficient and quick and easy to use .
0	i had some issues ( my fault ) with addresses but the customer service was great - a real_person , by email and problem_solved straight_away .
0	just wish i had more phones to sell !
0	i '_ve ordered many_times from kiddicare and also visited their store a few_times .
0	i '_ve always received my items quickly without issue and their 0 year return_policy is fantastic , as we all know that things change when it comes to kids .
0	most recently i had a car_seat delivered but it wasn_'_t the colour expected so i took it back without the box as it wouldn_'_t fit in my car .
0	they were quick and helpful and i had my refund with no_issues .
0	great , my favourite retailer for childrens products and if you need a pushchair check out their top floor , it '_s immense !
0	i '_m a returning_customer and just had to share what a great company this is .
0	i '_m often wary of offers on groupon as more often than not i '_m let_down .
0	however hellocanvas produce quality items in a timely matter .
0	i just emailed a question about my latest order and got a reply within minutes .
0	their editing_options when ordering ensure the perfect canvas and the postage_charges are fair ( the first time i paid £ 0 and got the canvas 0_days_later .
0	this time it was free delivery and i had an_email within 0_days to say it '_s being printed .
0	i '_ll not even get into how much_better this is than other 0 month long experiences which ended in me getting someone_elses prints !
0	fantastic .
0	would recommend to anyone .
0	i desperately_needed running shorts but the local_stores wanted to charge me almost £_00 .
0	i went on here knowing that they were reasonable and got a fantastic pair of shorts for only £ 0 .
0	at the time there was free delivery which was great .
0	they came quickly , and i even got a free mug and brochure with money off vouchers in the book .
0	easy to use website and the sizing is correct .
0	this company is a rip_off !
0	i bought a £_00 fixed - term , fixed - rate contract and they have the cheek to put up their prices for all user not just new ones .
0	when i called to enquire i was told it was only about 00p , and that if i did want to cancel ( as many other prices are rising for me ( i . e .
0	gas , electric ) a phone isn_'_t a necessity for me ) i would have to pay the rest of my contract off .
0	there are better offers out there with better networks , who have a better coverage than orange .
0	i can '_t even stand in my kitchen and call somebody because there is no signal !
0	will be changing companies as soon as my contract_ends !
0	i find this site really easy to order off .
0	i have bought a variety of things and they are always good quality .
0	the free delivery helps a lot as many sites want to charge around £ 0 for delivery that is slow .
0	also good pricing as you can get fair priced things in one place , without hunting_around .
0	such a useful source for travel reviews and advice .
0	some bogus posts obviously but base it on the volume of responses .
0	how can anyone leave a positive reference if they haven_'_t won anything in years ?
0	seriously though had a win on the instant online games but connection went down for a few seconds and the in game win was lost .
0	although i was given the game again the £ 0 on board win was lost .
0	not happy .
0	easy to use , quick and no isle traffic !
0	love my chesterfield_sofa , amazing price too , no_complaints .
0	i love using this site as the information is very easy to find , there are always plenty of reviews for properties and the booking_system is very straightforward .
0	thanks !
0	its great to be able to order food this way , nice quick and easy .
0	x_x_x
0	i sent it off then the next_day the money was in my account and recieved the package to send it off in really fast
0	i was completely un satisfied with the service , i had to email them multiple_times in order to get my check through the post .
0	not only that but my ipod must have broke in the post so i got under half of the money i should have got .
0	i called city_link to reschedule my my delivery , i need to change it to a different address , after 00_minutes of waiting - still no answer - what a joke and rip_off !
0	i would recommend first_class watches to anyone , they price matched the watch i brought and it was delivered the next_day !
0	the website is easy to use and the watches are clearly_displayed .
0	i cannot_fault them !
0	i have had such great sucess with hostel_bookers !
0	i '_ve been on both_sides of the fence with them , managing a hostel in canada and using their site daily to update availability and receive bookings , and now to do my own travel and book_hostels as a backpacker .
0	i can_honestly_say that it is absolutely effortless .
0	simple and to the point ... what any traveller wants when it comes to planning !
0	i find hostel_bookers to have more locations of hostels than other booking sites out there and can make a choice very quickly of where to go by cruising the reviews of unbaised travellers that have been and stayed at the hostels and searching prices within a backbackers budget .
0	accomodation becomes effortless !
0	i instantly received an_email_confirming my booking and it was cheaper_than hostel_world .
0	needless to say i will be using hostelbookers in the future .
0	hostelbookers is my go - to website for any accommodation booking .
0	i '_m off on three_months ' travel around_europe and have used them for almost all my accommodation .
0	the reviews are reliable , website easy to use and generally has the lowest_prices you can find for places - a big bonus !
0	oh , you found a lower price for an item ?
0	just plug that price in on supplementwarehouse . com and the link to the lowprice and the price adjuster automatically gives you 0 %_off the competitor '_s price !
0	in two cases , with xylitol and nutritional yeast i paid only half of what the discount prices are - i can now justify buying the supplemental foods i love .
0	a higher shipping price still leaves you with wads of extra_cash , not to mention , in some cases , just driving to the health_food store would burn more in gas and you '_d have the way higher retail prices .
0	plus , speedy shipping , have your items so quick and cheap .
0	love it !
0	!
0	superb prices , excellent site , easy to use .
0	i love shopping here !!
0	thanks pradamark ... ^ _ ^
0	ordring on the site is horrible , miles easier and faster and you have more choice changing the pizza when you phone .
0	i will never order again on the site or via the app .
0	custmer support dont want to know , total rubbish company
0	the website is very well_laid_out and easy to follow , processing is fast and they keep you updated on your order .
0	excellent value for money .
0	like to say a great big thank_you to release travel , especially to carlee walker who couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
0	hotel was great and very central in sunny brighton would definately recomend cocktail_making and oceana night club !!
0	fantastic and hastel free weekend !!

0	great prices .
0	i have bought several wowchers over the past six_months .
0	some deals were fine and i was able to redeem .
0	with other deals however , it has_been impossible to get an_appointment .
0	atelier m , a small beauty_salon in putney , is the worst culprit - they clearly sold too many wowchers for ipl treatments (£_00 ) and are unable to cope with the demand .
0	i have been calling them every day for weeks on end to book a treatment but they will not pick_up the phone and have no voicemail or email .
0	i have contacted wowcher '_s customer service but still no luck in redeeming my wowcher or getting a refund !
0	i feel totally_ripped_off , not to mention the amount of time i have wasted and the frustration that this has caused .
0	wowcher must do a better job of vetting its suppliers and imposing sanctions if they are unable to honour their promises .
0	easy , quick and affordable bookings .
0	would recommend
0	the service was average .
0	arrival - we travelled late arriving in turkey in the evening and had to wait the best part of an_hour for other passengers to arrive from their flight .
0	although the resort_hoppa representative was very friendly , we were extremely tired and had no real explanation of how much time we might have to wait .
0	departure - the app that we were told to download didn_'_t allow us to find out our pick_up time , so i had to call them .
0	this was very tricky because the turkish representatives spoke little english and so i had to ask our hotel reception staff to speak with them for us .
0	all of this was pretty stressful at the end of our holiday , as we were panicking that we may need to arrange alternative transport .
0	i like that the site because it is very clear and easy to use .
0	for a customer hostelbookers offers a huge_variety of accomodation . you can search and will find just the one right regarding to your requests .
0	furthermore the hostelbookers offers very good prices for accomodation properties .
0	i was always satisfied with my choice and would definately recommend this site to my friends .
0	all the best !
0	order arrived after only a couple of days .
0	well_packaged but not wasteful .
0	exactly_what i ordered and it was a great price .
0	very impressed , will definitely use again .
0	:)
0	it would have been quicker for me to request a cheque and get that processed by my bank !
0	it '_s 0000 - how is it taking 00 days to complete an online payment ?
0	telling customers that bank transfers are the fastest method of payment is false_advertising .
0	' we ' re really busy in january ' is not acceptable - you know you ' re going to be busy .
0	employ more resource .
0	it '_s not rocket_science .
0	i '_d be less upset if , before i '_d posted my ipad , you '_d told me there was a delay in payments .
0	still , i '_ve got until the 00th of the month now to review you all over the place ...
0	as if shopping online wasn_'_t enough fun already - i have made a small_fortune since i found this site !
0	easy to use , it really is as good as it seems , i '_ve never had any_problems with it and will be getting a christmas party dress for free this year thanks to the money i have earned !
0	thanks topcashback !
0	i was really impressed with the customer service i received from zooplus , they have a lifelong customer in me now !
0	would definitely recommend to anyone .
0	quick and easy checkout and lots of free offers along with great prices on the products i was looking for .
0	the first thing to say is that it works .
0	i found a lodger in just a couple of days .
0	it '_s very simple to use , and well set out .
0	the cherry on the icing_on the cake with spareroom is that they give you loads of information about what else you need to do .
0	for example , they send me stuff about tax so i knew whether or not i would need to pay any as a landlord .
0	it '_s incredibly easy to buy from here .
0	this is unfortunate , because although they often have amazing deals on the prices , i still shouldn_'_t buy so many !
0	their customer service is great too .
0	i was quite nervous_about getting laser_eye_surgery so when i finally decided to go for it i did quite a bit of research as i wanted to be sure i would get the best care possible .
0	from_start to finish the team at optegra were brilliant .
0	i went to the guildford clinic and it was spotlessly_clean and always so efficient .
0	the staff were very professional but human as well !
0	everything was clearly_explained so that i knew_exactly_what to expect , there is a lovely nurse by your side through the whole_procedure to help reassure you and keep you calm if you are nervous like me .
0	the procedure was over in a matter of minutes and by that night i could already see clearly .
0	they gave_me everything i needed in a take home kit for the aftercare and i knew_exactly_what i needed to be doing when with drops etc .
0	i got it done a couple of weeks before i went on holiday to thailand for the first time - it was the best decision i have ever made .
0	i had a brilliant holiday without having to worry or bother about switching between glasses and prescription_sunglasses or putting contacts in and out , which was a first for a long time .
0	it was brilliant !
0	thank_you so much to mr rob morris and his lovely team at optegra in guidlford !
0	i can '_t fault the customer service i have received from etyres .
0	the girl i spoke to on the phone was very helpful when i asked her about tyre sizes and the tyre technician turned_up on time with a smile on his face taking extra care over my alloy_wheels .
0	will certainly be recommending etyres to my friends and family !
0	quick and easy service and company were quick to help me with my queries thanks !
0	will use again !
0	i have used booking . com for a number of years and it is excellent !!
0	i have never had a complaint as it shows prices and maps so its very clear what you are booking and where .
0	whenever i have needed to cancel it has_been a very straight_forward process .
0	i would thoroughly_recommend the site .
0	flights are in march so as long as they go fine i '_ll be happy but no_hassle so far !
0	products arrived quickly
0	checked online to get the best price for my iphone_0s and although enviro_phone weren_'_t the highest price , they had the best reviews .
0	i would rather go with enviro_phone at a lower price but have the trust that i will get the money !!!
0	super easy to process and they send full instructions .
0	you can check the progress online and on the same day they received my phone , i had an_email promising me the price they offered .
0	money was transferred super_fast .
0	will_defo use them again , superb service , thank_you enviro_phone !!
0	!
0	the quote i received was very fair and seemed very easy to sign up .
0	the courier arrived on time and was hassle_free .
0	i was kept up to date every_step of the way via_email and was rung the next_day to state that my laptop had been accepted and the money was on its way .
0	i can '_t_believe_how fast it all happened and the customer service was fantastic !!
0	i will definitely recommend to anyone , it '_s the best !!
0	!
0	this is the second delivery and installation of a kitchen_appliance from ao . com and both have been seamless .
0	today i was quoted a delivery time of 00 . 00 to 00 . 00 but got a call to say they would be here at 00 . 00 .
0	both the driver , who '_s name i did not catch , and the technician mark were friendly and efficient .
0	the job was done in under an_hour and they tidied_up after themselves .
0	tell your friends and family to use this company
0	flowers delivered on time and the recipient said they were outstanding
0	wide_range of products , great prices , very fast delivery , will definitely be shopping with viovet again and would recommend to my friends .
0	used hungry_house a few_times with no_complaints .
0	i often rely_on other_users reviews as i am new to my area and count on their honesty when ordering takeaway .
0	i enjoy the fact that you so many cuisines , fairly_priced and available to you via the site .
0	keep_up the good work !
0	have used the site for a number of large purchases via_ebay .
0	i have found the drivers to be very communicative , friendly , helpful and most of all great value for money .
0	i would highly_recommend the site .
0	i have had large pieces of furniture shipped from scotland to london for under_£_00 . 00 plus , such good value .
0	we also changed supplier in september_0000 .
0	or so we thought .
0	so far we have heard_nothing from the company , nothing at all and it was 0_months_ago !
0	we are still getting our bills from our old supplier .
0	we are quite fed_up and do not want to rely_on first_utility in the future .
0	we have contacted energylinx ( the agent ) to confirm that the contract we took out in september_0000 is now none and void .
0	i ordered the w - 0000 bike stand at an amazing price with an extra discount .
0	i '_m very happy with the service , packaging and the stand itself .
0	thank_you very much .
0	having dealt the lee from this company back in 0000 , i was delighted to get another wonderful service and a great cv - thanks ..
0	super quick delivery and a fantastic product , i have no doubts this will get me interviews !
0	highly_recommended !
0	ordered a dragonflies yummy_mummy nappy bag via_facebook on special_offer .
0	it was a beautiful product and can '_t wait to use it .
0	once i had ordered it , it came very quickly and was packed really well to prevent_any damage .
0	would definitely use them again if i see another deal or need anything as the product was a lovely quality and was very attractive
0	the worst experience regarding delivery services !
0	still i gave it 0_stars due to a good soul working at the depot who did everything he could to sort_out my problem .
0	monday_morning got a text saying " your parcel will be with you today " as i was on my way to work , called in sick and ran home .
0	and waited , waited and waited , at 0pm decided to check the website and track my order , when to my surprise it says " your parcel was sent back as it was a duplicate order " huh ?
0	i thought that maybe currys had sent another parcel and didn_'_t think too much about it .
0	0 :_00pm came by and i finally decided to call a customer service number i found online .
0	she then tells_me that i wasn_'_t at home when the driver stopped by ...
0	what ?????
0	that '_s a lie !
0	have been on the sofa watching stupid tv shows all day long waiting for the driver , he never came !!!!
0	she then checked the gps and it was confirmed that the driver had been nowhere_near my place .
0	she then tried to contact the driver unsuccessfully + the depot also unsuccessfully .
0	its now 0 : 00 and she tells_me she finishes at 0 and as she cant get thru the driver nor the depot i '_ll have to call back in the morning !
0	hahahaha you gotta be joking , keep trying !!!
0	i didn_'_t miss work for nothing !
0	at 0 . 00 , after being on hold she finally manage to get thru to the depot and came up with a ridiculous story saying the driver had gone to the wrong_address and the person at that address had said they '_d already got their item .
0	so the driver sent it back as a duplicate order .
0	i now had to call currys to sort_out this issue in order for them to re - deliver my parcel and as they refused to allocate me a time_slot i then arranged for thursday .
0	thursday 0pm , still no parcel , i called customer_services again and to my surprise there is no record on the system regarding my parcel .
0	i called the depot and its is confirmed that my parcel hasn_'_t been dispatched and also that they don_'_t know where it is .... is this for real ???
0	i lost my temper and had a go at the person talking to me .
0	mr kwame then after apologizing a million times said he will find it and sort it out .
0	0 hours_later he called me back , he had located my parcel and was gonna send it to my house .
0	it arrived at 0pm .
0	thanks to mr kwame i didn_'_t have to waste another day waiting for nothing .
0	everybody else i spoke with were useless , specially customer service , if they can be called that .
0	by choice i '_ll never use them again .
0	my husband wanted to move his flight from may 00th to april 00th .
0	he had to call 0 times just to get someone_who could actually help him .
0	they wanted to charge us over_$ 0000 to move the flight to a different day , $_000 for the flight and $_000 in fees .
0	that '_s outrageous .
0	we paid $ 0000 for the ticket and all we wanted to do was fly the same route on a different day .
0	i did the same thing with air canada in december , i moved my flight from the 00th to the 00th and they did it for me no problem and it cost $_00 .
0	i will never book with flighthub again .
0	i have just had both my brakes and tyres_fitted with this great company .
0	the very pleasant office staff called me to confirm that both could be done together , and after_discovering how far one of them had to travel , it made me realise even more how good the service is and how much they aim to please .
0	brett who fitted my tyres was efficient , thorough and very polite , clearly a hard worker he is a credit to the company .
0	mick who fitted my brakes was equally fantastic , he has many_years of experience and it showed , he talked_me through the job and his passion for the job , the company and his colleagues was refreshing .
0	i told him i was concerned_about my steering and he went the extra mike by checking my steering fluid , you can '_t buy service like that .
0	very high_quality in their standards of work , friendly and hard working , it isn_'_t just the price that made me a very happy customer !
0	would highly_recommend and definitely return to them .
0	thank_you very much !
0	vee , oldbury .
0	where do i start , i '_m so fussy when it comes to prams and didn_'_t think i would ever find one ..
0	so you can_imagine my relief ( more relief on partners side i think ) when i walk into the shop and fall in love with the new silvercross wayfarer back in !!!! may !!!!
0	.
0	anyway my partner quickly placed the order and paid the deposit to which we were told there would be 0 week wait for all the parts to arrive in stock ( which we were perfectly happy with ) and we would receive a phone_call to let us know that it was available for collection .
0	time went by and no phone_call so i made the call 0_weeks_ago ( 0_weeks after order being placed ) to be told that there was a 0 week wait on the bag , which i was a little p #* sed off about as we hadn_'_t been told any different and no one had bothered to phone to keep us updated .
0	0_weeks passed my partner phoned last_week to check everything was available to which we were told that the order was complete and available to collect when we are ( imagine my relief ) had a smile on my face all week because i knew i would be getting my pram this week as i am now full term and ready to drop !
0	.
0	i got on the phone yesterday to arrange pick_up ( 00 weeks after ordering ) to be told that there are parts_missing from the order leaving me heart broken on the phone !
0	again no phone_call to keep me updated !
0	after my partner had been on the phone a few_times and made his feelings clear to different people they decided to offer a pre_owned / discontinued pram bag as a stop_gap which matches the pram in no way shape or form ( it isn_'_t black or pink or even silver_cross ) i don_'_t expect to order a lovely looking pram to have an eyesore hanging off it ......
0	the customer service is absolutely_shocking and i am not a happy lady at all , not only has this had me pulling my hair out but the likelyhood is that i am not going to have a complete pram when my baby arrives ....
0	i could sort of expect this service from some company '_s but not from a so called ' pram specialist ' i '_m hoping this matter gets resolved soon because upto now i am getting_nowhere :(
0	i attempted to purchase a photoshoot with wowcher last_week , and after my 0rd_attempt at trying , and receiving a message each time saying payment card rejected ( though the money in both accounts i tried with was available ) i gave up .
0	upon_checking my bank_account , and contacting my banks that evening , i find the money has after all been taken , yet i have received no wowcher email_saying that i had purchased 0 lots of the photoshoot .
0	i have , of course , emailed wowcher regarding this , and surprise , surprise , have received no response .
0	will certainly not be using again !
0	order arrived within 00_hours and was securely_packaged .
0	excellent and speedy service and price was unbeatable
0	its fantastic company .
0	fill in online the details , received next_day the freepost abg , posted the phone and checked arrived within next 0_days .
0	absolutely fantastic and quick service .
0	for one , you can '_t even complain to them properly as their complaint form on their website has a 000 character limit and for some people it is impossible to use their phone line , especially if you have speech problems like me .
0	i ordered a present for a friend over a month_ago and it never came .
0	0_weeks_ago i emailed them on their crappy website and was told it had been sent , but they could either refund or resend it .
0	i responded saying i would like it resent , and i never got a reply .
0	so here i am , over 0_weeks_later with my friends birthday been and gone still trying to find a way to contact them .
0	i had to research and find a customer service email address on the internet that isn_'_t stated on the site , just so i could explain my situation properly .
0	i also can '_t find my order anywhere on my account - i don_'_t even think it gives you the option to see what you '_ve ordered !
0	even_though it was apparently delivered to my house , i was never contacted about when it was dispatched and it certainly never showed up .
0	absolutely ridiculous .
0	ordered yankee tea light candles and was easy to order and they came quickly and in excellent condition .
0	would use their site again .
0	rentrant en france régulièrement , je peux grace à_ce_site , trouver les meilleurs prix pour_les traversées , selon le port ou la compagnie choisie .
0	le site est facile_d ' utilisation et contient en plus beaucoup d ' infos pratiques , sur l ' hébergement , les différentes routes ...
0	a recommander !
0	!
0	the bag to send the phones off arrived really fast with full instructions and was well explained .
0	they done exactly as they said they wopuld do and met all my standards .
0	they followed this through with updating emails etc which was great .
0	they paid exactly_what they said they would and told me everything as it happened .
0	took my iphone in for repair which was completed the same day .
0	would definitely recommend this company .
0	i recently_purchased a pair of black suede truffle ankle_boots .
0	they arrived very fast ( i think 0 - 0_days ), they were packed well and they were exactly as_described .
0	they fit_perfectly and are very comfortable .
0	overall excellent service and i will be purchasing from here again in future .
0	easy to book .
0	very organised web and always getting what you expected .
0	i came_across bodykind when searching for some of my natural supplements online , one of their google ads drew me in ... ( i normally try to avoid these !)
0	but i was very impressed with their clear and efficient layout , detailed product information , and friendly service over the phone .
0	very good value too .
0	really horrid airline to fly with - its impossible to sleep , they keep blasting loud ads at you , the chairs are stuck in upright_position , the light is so bright , and all so that you can buy more things with them ( as of course none of the food / drink is free even !)
0	optibac offer a range of probiotics as its their speciality .
0	so you can be sure that the different products have been well planned out and researched .
0	my family and i have been taking them for years , after having tried other probiotics , and we all feel great on the optibac .
0	full_marks for quality , and full_marks for value too .
0	it was a piece of cake to use mazuma .
0	i had 0 old_phones which i thought were worthless .
0	it took 00_minutes to log all the phones on the website using the imei_numbers and they instantly recognised the phones , gave_me a quote and sent out the pack to post back to them within 0 working day .
0	i posted the phones off on wednesday last_week and by monday we had the money .
0	really pleased .
0	my order which was ordered for next_day delivery took over a week to be delivered !
0	called numerous_times and emailed to be fobbed_off and made promises which were never kept .
0	after cancelling the order it was still delivered and even after returning the order i had to chase them up for a refund .
0	customer service was awful , communication was awful would take 00mins plus to get through to them on the phone every time .
0	if i could rate then a 0 i would have !
0	their valuation was competitive and they sent out a return pre_- paid postal_bag so the whole_process was very easy .
0	i posted it back through the post_office on the thursday so that i had proof of purchase and received confirmation of receipt and also payment within a matter of days .
0	very trustworthy service .
0	i would recommend previous little_ones to everyone , they always have the best products at the best prices , delivery is always spot_on and i '_ve never had any_issues with them , brilliant company :)
0	good variety of restaurants available on the site , with some new entries that i can '_t find on any of their_competitors ' websites .
0	nothing special about the website as a whole .
0	they do offer some form of customer service ( which i haven_'_t tried ), but they take no responsibility for actually getting the food out to you .
0	can '_t see the functionality to store favourites , card_details , etc_., which would be good for repeat_orders .
0	worth a visit though .
0	i '_ve been buying from amazon for years , both through their online site and through the iphone_app .
0	they really do make everything as effortless as possible and generally offer good value for money when compared with other online sites , apart_from when it comes to ebooks for the kindle .
0	i '_m an amazon_prime member so i almost always get my orders the next_day - there '_s only been one hiccup so far .
0	had to return a breast pump which had stopped_working and they replaced it within 0_days and also collected the old one , with a minimum of fuss ( only online forms to fill in and the bother of posting the old pump back ).
0	this is now a trusted site for me .
0	unexpectedly good value from comet in their sale this year .
0	bought a washer_dryer on friday and had it delivered on sunday .
0	only found a 00_quid difference_between the cheapest site on the web and the comet price , so went with comet as it '_s more of a known quantity .
0	free delivery charge , although roughly 00_quid for removing the old_washer_dryer and installing the new one .
0	made everything low hassle and the machine is working well .
0	ordered a washer_dryer for my tenants for delivery in 0_days , as i didn_'_t want them to spend christmas without one .
0	order cancelled the afternoon before delivery was due , due to failure of an_automated security_check despite the site having sent me a receipt to tell me payment had been taken .
0	company unable to explain_why security_check was failed , citing data_protection reasons ( which shouldn_'_t pose a problem , given it '_s my data ).
0	i '_ve never_failed a check before , so no idea why this might be - different delivery address to billing_address maybe (?).
0	no help offered , so tenants will spend christmas without a machine .
0	not a position i '_d like to leave anyone in .
0	really impressed with the service from pure_luxuries .
0	i ordered a messenger_bag for my brother and it was perfect .
0	the delivery super quick even at christmas and the system they use for delivery is really neat ; you get a text_telling you the likely arrival time and can track the driver through their web app .
0	i would definitely recommend pure_luxuries !
0	hi , i received the outfit reasonably quickly but when it arrived i noticed the dress had a hole on the seam .
0	i decided to not send the outfit back for an exchange as i was unsure if i would receive the replacement in time for when i needed it .
0	i do not fault the service and delivery but disappointing that the outfit was faulty when it arrived .
0	lynsey thomas
0	fabulous service better_than letting my old phone collect dust in a draw , i received £_00 for my old phone so my old phone has_transformed into a new pair of shoes :)
0	the service and delivery from this company perfectly reflects the high_quality product they are selling .
0	in a panic i bought a last_minute travel wallet for my partners xmas_present .... 00_hours_later it was sat on my desk !
0	you get an_email when it is packed and then again when it is with the courier so you have every idea exactly where your item is at all_stages of its journey which is great .
0	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to buy from them again and again and again .
0	:)
0	i can '_t fault any stage of my online purchase .
0	the products were as_described and will be perfect for my holiday !
0	they delivered my parcel a good week ahead of a competitor after 0 working_days .
0	a great example of an online_retailer getting price , product offering and service bang_on !
0	:)
0	do not buy from toywatch . co . uk .
0	after receiving a faulty watch i soon came to realise that their customer service is non_existent and i am now struggling to track my return which according to them is " pending " despite it being " delivered " by royal_mail .
0	i expect more from a company when your spending £_000 +.
0	save_yourself the hassle and buy it on the high - street just in case .
0	from_start to finish the process was professional and the service second to none .
0	we described the wedding_rings that we wanted and they bought them to life , keeping us involved at every_step of the design process .
0	if you want good quality rings at a competitive price alba_rose is the place to go !
0	thoroughly recommended .
0	i like to use hostelbookers because it is an easy experience .
0	the website is nicely_laid_out and easy to use .
0	hostelbookers is cheaper_than hostelworld for the same bookings .
0	this gives me faith that they are more about the traveller and less about the corperation .
0	i have found this company to be very good - with great deals on a lot of popular businesses .
0	great payouts too !
0	i was absolutely appalled at what ebay has now chosen for an_alternative website for selling tickets .
0	i needed to sell some tickets that i had for a gig .
0	i set about trying to sell them on ebay .
0	when i clicked on ' list ' ebay told me i had to sell tickets on " stubhub " instead .
0	although it gave_me a link to click on , when " stubhub " loaded , and asked me to sign in , it did not accept my ebay sign in details .
0	you have to create a brand_new account on " stubhub ".
0	all the effort i '_d put in to listing my tickets on ebay was lost , and i had to start again .
0	when i finally got to listing my tickets on " stubhub " it asked me did i want to email the buyer the tickets , or send them by u . p . s .
0	there was no option to meet the buyer at the gig to give them my tickets .
0	( i was going to the gig myself so this would '_ve been ideal )
0	i could not email the tickets as i would '_ve had to have scanned them , and they would '_ve been rejected at the gates as copies .
0	i have no idea what they meant by u . p . s delivery so i was stuck .
0	it asked me to enter a price i wanted per_ticket .
0	i wanted £_000 for both , so put in £_00 per_ticket .
0	it then showed me what the buyer would pay -£_000 . 00 per_ticket !
0	if you press " see your payout " it shows you how much you would get through this rip - off site - the price for 0 tickets (£_000 ) minus their commission (£_00 . 00 ) so i would end up with £_000 . 00 after everything .
0	i would not recommend it to anyone , as it stressed me out unbearably that they not only make it very hard to resell your tickets , but they rip customers off in the process - just like other ticket sites do !
0	i do not believe in ripping_people off !
0	this website had guest_houses where i actually needed it , rather_than suggesting somewhere 0 miles_away like others have !
0	the website is easy to use , with some good pics .
0	i like the fact that you can put a deposit down when you book it but don_'_t have to pay the full_amount til nearer the time .
0	staff who were impressively helpful and accommodating with competitively_priced products .
0	a winning formula for return custom .
0	i had booked a ferry which is due to sail tomorrow .
0	i called a week_ago to explain that i may not be able to travel .
0	i was advised that would have £_00 deducted from the price of my ticket for cancelling , and receive £_000 in ferry vouchers .
0	with this in mind , i called today to cancel , and was advised that i wouldn_'_t receive the said refund vouchers and would either lose out all together , or would have to pay a further £_00 to amend the booking to next year .
0	i was then advised that it stated in the t &_cs that i was to give 0_days notice but when i clicked on them to view them , i got a 000 error so wasn_'_t able to see them .
0	for anyone not in the business , a 000 error occurs if a website has moved a page or resource but did so without redirecting the old url to the new one .
0	i have screen prints of this to prove it , but was advised by ' jane ' that it was my computers fault , and that she could see them .
0	i work in ecommerce , so would expect t &_cs to be available should customers need to view them .
0	i '_m now faced with another £_00 charge or lose out all together .
0	if this wasn_'_t bad enough , ' imogen ' the customer service girl i was speaking with , could be heard whispering to a colleague about me .
0	unfortunately , a ferry do not record their telephone_conversations , so it is my word_against their '_s .
0	i welcome a response to this .
0	i usually use another very popular internet florist ( rhymes with tinterflora !)
0	but they had run_out of all mothers_day bouquet in my ( large ) town .
0	this was a good week before mothers_day .
0	i am_furious so i tried iflorist with some hesitancy as i hadn_'_t used them before and mothers_day is a high pressure situation .
0	to my delight my mums flowers were amazing and delivered at the exact time they said theu would be ( on mothering_sunday for no extra_charge ) and everyone was happy and delighted , especially my mum who had an amazing bouquet .
0	thanks i florist for saving my skin .
0	i think i will convert to you for all my flowers .
0	the process has_been so easy so far .
0	it was as easy as abc .
0	literally paid for the divorce , got the email , logged in and completed the petition .
0	before i knew it the petition was ready to download .
0	i almost ran to the court with the petitions and the cheque !
0	court actually served my husband with the papers the next_day !
0	0_days_later he had signed them and handed back in to the court !
0	i really hope the rest of the process is this simple and quick .
0	really don_'_t know why i was contemplating paying a solicitor to do this for us .
0	still_waiting on the consent order but from what i can make out this should be just as simple .
0	so far i couldn_'_t recommend divorce_online enough !!!
0	:-)
0	i basically googled " discount opi varnish " and came to fragrance_direct !
0	best link ever in my opinion .
0	after browsing all of their products i landed on the nail_varnish section .
0	i myself am a nail addict and i love finding a good bargain on branded lacquer !
0	i ordered sooo_much nail_varnish it arrived in 0 boxes !
0	opi '_s , essie , l ' oreal , astor .
0	my life is complete .
0	ive found a brilliant site at brilliant prices with brilliant products !
0	why pay over the odds for new season colours when you can get them here for a lower price ?
0	definately using this site again .
0	cheers_guys :) xx
0	so i was told when i had my car mot '_d i needed 0 new tyres as they were really close to the limit !
0	i looked online as i always do and etyres was the best deal i could find .
0	not only were they the best deal but i could have them done at home , even better !
0	etyres organised the time_slot and i was contacted to check it was still ok on the day .
0	i was told at that point that they would check to see if i really needed them done .
0	the fitter did exactly that and said i could go a few more months and there was no need to change them now !
0	to my relief he said they would give me a full_refund !
0	how brilliant i thought , amazing prompt service and honest too ... not many people are like this nowadays and it was truly refreshing .
0	i would definitely recommend etyres for their excellent prices , slick service and honest employees !
0	thank_you !
0	fabulous package of lessons and tests .
0	would definitely recommend to a friend to complete one of these courses too .
0	feel like i have learnt so much over the past few_weeks .
0	also with my busy_schedule there was no_pressure to complete the course within a specific time period so felt at ease completing as and when i could !
0	fantastic !

0	all my shopping is delivered on time the drivers are friendly and have never had a problem with tesco
0	they are unreliable and they are not a company i would go to again they sent me out the wrong handset i sent it back unopened and they said that the phone had to be inspected and the handset i had ordered would not be restocked for 00 days so i had to pay my first bill without recieving the contract handset i cancelled my order and am going to a company that is more reliable !!!
0	!
0	rebooked my parcel for same day collection and emailed my label emma was very helpful and fast at sorting my problem out like the live help will use again
0	i bought some flowers , chocolates , a balloon , a vase and a teddy_bear for my mums_birthday !
0	once the flowers opened they were beautiful !
0	i had my mum take pictures for me too see !
0	everything arrived on time and in one piece and my mum also said the chocolates were delicious too !
0	one thing tho is the lillie '_s only lasted a week !
0	so them coming unopened really didn_'_t make a difference in them lasting longer ... just made us wait longer to see the pretty orange flowers .
0	part from that everything was great .
0	will be happy to use this website again !!
0	:)
0	divine_trash is my all time favourite clothes shop !
0	everytime i visit the staff are always very welcoming and friendly .
0	i always find something to buy that i like , and the staff are always there to give you choices about what to wear it with if your unsure .
0	this is the shop i always reccomend to my friends !
0	i completed my full transaction within 0_days , it was amazing service .
0	could not fault it : ) x
0	my first purchase was a black knitted dress from the site , the dress came in the post in a couple of days , very good delivery service !
0	however when i opended the parcel the dress was crumpled up in a plastic_bag inside and the material felt very cheap !
0	the fit was not very flattering and i felt that i could have bought the dress much_cheaper with a better quality at a shop like primark !
0	the hasstle of returning the package to a collection shop and filling in the forms meant that i have ended_up keeping it !
0	i think the return_policy should be longer .
0	i would be wary of purchasing from the site again as my dress looked a lot better on the site , and for a garment that is so simple to get right i would be afraid to get anything_else !
0	i '_ve been using beatport for the last 0 years and in my opinion they are the best online distributor for electronic music .
0	the newly developed site is so easy to navigate !
0	one of the most useful features of the site is the way that the player keeps all the tracks that you have recently played so it '_s really handy when browsing through hundreds of tracks !
0	i find the genre browsers very well_organised and i also find the dj charts very useful when finding new tracks !
0	i '_ve never had any_issues purchasing or downloading from beatport , and the way it remembers_your card_details for your account is really handy , when you ' re in a rush to grab a tune before you ' re rushing for a set i know i can get it quickest from beatport !
0	i also find the prices very competative compared to other download sites .
0	keep it up !
0	becs
0	didn_'_t go on intending to buy anything and ended_up filling my basket :-) loved the products and loved the prices .
0	very prompt delivery despite living in highlands and islands so i was extremely impressed .
0	no question - i will definitely be ordering from campus_gifts again
0	samantha was very quick when dealing_with my problem , booked a collection for me as i was unable to do so , done it in quick time , very helpful , much_appreciated !
0	never beat a voucher site , not many better_than this .
0	0_* , will be using it more often than ebay
0	easy , user_friendly , fast
0	really easy site to use , they sent me update_emails & i was also able to track the package .
0	excellent service .
0	i '_ve_used mazuma before so they were the first place i turned to when i wanted to get_rid of my now redundant mobile .
0	the service i received last time was so swift & thorough that i didn_'_t even bother_wasting my time checking other_websites .
0	i '_m pleased ( but not shocked ) to say that my experience this time was just as good - from initial_enquiry to payment was 0_days .
0	gotta < 0 mazuma !
0	x
0	i received my package on time however the packaging for the fragrance i bought was partially opened , wrinkled and damaged .
0	the item was bought as a present to someone_else , which makes it even more disappointing .
0	reliable service to use , easy and efficient .
0	i would recommend using mazuma to friends and family .
0	thank_you :-)
0	i would definately recommend release travel to anybody booking a stag or hen_party away !
0	i booked leeds for a hen_party and it was brilliant !..... much more than what i expected .
0	the hotel was great , full of atmosphere , everybody pleasant , rooms of a very high_standard and the whole weekend was brill !
0	we went quad biking through release , had a meal pre_- booked also a butler for the night !!
0	everybody came away having a fab weekend :-) i will be booking with release in the future .
0	thankyou lee for all of your work for arranging the weekend !
0	!
0	love whoever ashley is :) she was so quick to answer my questions , and i had few .
0	and everything was just so easy .
0	i do not like complicated websites with too many buttons etc .
0	the chat was so easy to use and ever so quick .
0	once again , thank_you ashley
0	best prices for kerastase and consistently great delivery .
0	love_em !
0	i '_ve been using printed . com over the last_year or so and couldn_'_t be more chuffed with their service .
0	major advantage is the easy upload and quoting service on their clear and friendly website .
0	no more waiting on printers to come_back to you with prices !
0	their stock range is great , their print quality is fantastic ( indigo presses - yay ) and their turnaround quick and reliable !
0	they ' re constantly improving themselves upon customer suggestions and come_back to you pretty pronto when you email them a question .
0	i '_m a big_fan - can you tell ?
0	perfect service , great value , quick money transfer .
0	we have been dealing_with mdp for around 0 years and we have experienced many issues with them over the years .
0	mainly down to incorrect orders unfortunately .. often the products are wrong , aren_'_t included , wrong sizes etc ..
0	but i do have to say they always sort the problems quickly and at their own cost .
0	parcels often arrive damaged , which you could put down to the delivery company or the thin boxes that are used .
0	we have tried to find other_companies who have an order process as easy as theirs but nothing_compares at all ( including on price ) so we just stick with them and deal with the mistakes .
0	the online assistant catherine is very helpful .
0	she made my experience so much_easier and pleasant especially i '_m under the time pressure .
0	well_done !
0	will definitely use again and recommended to friends and family .
0	intuitive website , very easy to use .
0	the tract rate however needs_improving though for different internet_explorer ( i . e .
0	firefox , google_chrome , etc_.)
0	puchased an amazin pair of shoes for an event and needed them within two_days , they phoned to say there was an issue and their warehouse had sold the last pair that size but not update the sales_team in time .
0	after offereing refund and discount , they did some extra digging and arranged a delivery direct from the supplier at amazing short_notice and sorted all the invoicing details out .
0	they are friendly , truely excellent and have brilliant customer service .
0	i would not_hesitate to recommend them , you should definitely buy your shoes from them as they go the extra_mile for their customers .
0	the online homebrew company are really good price_wise and delivery wise .
0	there may be one or two sites that are the same price but i know these_guys will deliver within a few_days so i keep using them .
0	they often have discount days of % 00 off which quite_frankly i have never seen done before and done so frequently !
0	and there is no catch .
0	i don_'_t know about any of the customer service problems as i '_ve never needed to contact them .
0	i spent_ages trying to get my design printed on a placemat and spent loads on botched attempts only to find these_guys !
0	decent prices , prompt customer_services response , , and a great product !
0	delivered in 0_days during the snow !
0	the shipping fee , for first_class delivery , is wonderfully low as well .
0	i doubt you can beat it .
0	thanks people i will use you again .
0	it is so easy to use this website , considering how many items are on sale .
0	i like how the brands have been divided , as i usually know which brands it is that i want to look at .
0	the filtering system is also very user_friendly and easy to use .
0	great work !
0	the service was amazing - at times i thought it was a bit ott , with constant reminders on text_messages and automated calls , but i am not complaining .
0	i would much rather have lots of updates , rather_than having to chase companies up .
0	they were brilliant .
0	would definitely use again and again and again !
0	the price for this service was unbeatable .
0	the service provided too was unbeatable .
0	when we wanted to drop the car off , we didn_'_t need to wait and when we came off a long and tiring flight , still didn_'_t have to wait to receive our car .
0	definitely go with this company !
0	great service which was quick and easy to use .
0	amazing quality and service .
0	they ran a promotion for 0 pairs of bench glasses recently and i received them today .
0	thumbs_up from me !
0	its a very easy to use website .
0	just booked some accom in cairns which took about 0 minutes ( including the time it took me to get my credit_card from upstairs ).
0	easy !
0	cheaper products than other_places , quick and easy transaction and delivery
0	very easy to use website , tonnes of choice in hostels and hotels and booking is incredibly quick and straightforward .
0	have found some great hostels based on reviews and map features when booking .
0	have now booked well over 00 different places and been happy with them all .
0	this company saved me money and it really helped_me to understand the different broadband packages out there .
0	thanks - would definately recommend .
0	submitted a query_regarding my domain and received the answer and fixed the problem in a space of 00_mins .
0	this was out of normal office hours and was clear and straight to the point ( thank_you andrew for your speedy help ).
0	i would never choose another_provider ever , 000 reg has always been super efficient
0	definitely recommend this company !
0	great and friendly service
0	offer always suits my needs , very interesting emails and great discounts plus free_postage , what more would you want .
0	very good and fair service .
0	this was my first time ordering any protein or supplements off of the internet .
0	i shopped_around and called several stores and supplement_warehouse had the lowest cost .
0	when i decided to order from here the process was so simple and so fast i was done within 0 minutes .
0	including the time it took to write the review .
0	i will be making all my supplement purchases here from now on .
0	paid over_£_000 for an exercise_bike on saturday_afternoon , received confirmation of next_day delivery and further confirmation that my item would be with me on tuesday .
0	i am self_employed and had to take the day off on tuesday , nothing arrived , furthermore , i have been given no ability to track my item with the courier as i have never even been provided with a reference_number .
0	i am_furious as i have lost a full day '_s pay ( over_£_000 ) and am still without the item i purchased .
0	unprofessional !
0	just hate it when i have to call these_guys up - the most rubbish customer service , no one seems to know what they ' re talking_about , you get a different answer everytime you call up , and now we ' re spending £ 0 extra a month on a ' super hub ' which has done nothing to improve our broadband_speed at all !
0	!
0	i do like john_lewis - not least cos of the great customer service .
0	good quality products too .
0	it '_s just so reliable and easy to use - can always count on them in a birthday emergency too !
0	wow , i '_m loving roxy palace right now !
0	really user - friendly website , and a couple of nice wins so far :-)
0	website easy to view and prices are very reasonable . cheaper_than elsewhere we have searched online and in stores .
0	we bought the oyster pram and carrycot .
0	though a tiny glitch with when the item was going to be delivered all in all great customer service !
0	would shop again .
0	i ordered a pair , on delivery they had secure packing , i was surprised with the quick delivery .
0	just waiting to get another pair once back in stock ....:) recommended the site to my friends .....
0	item arrived on time and they produce good quality music .
0	great service , lenses were in perfect conditions as usual .
0	delivery was extremely fast .
0	been using lenstore for over a year now , they always have the best value contact_lenses and service .
0	i purchased a much needed dishwasher from this crowd .
0	they were great in clearing up all my questions and worries before i went_ahead and paid for the dishwasher .
0	best price around for what i wanted .
0	i '_m very happy with my purchase .
0	i was looking for a lot of different kitchen_appliances and i came_across corairs . com it had everything i wanted and i bought a breadmaker for my mam too she loved it .
0	thanks guys !
0	i ordered late at night and it sill arrived so quickly .
0	i love this website and have already_recommended it to my friends and family !
0	thank_you so much !
0	good service and quality !
0	i would like to see a free telephone_number
0	a return_label option .
0	thank_you
0	i love using supplement_warehouse for my supplement needs .
0	i am an amateur figure competitor and i certainly use my share of supplements !
0	things can definitely get pricey in this industry over time , but sw has saved me a ton of money since i started with them !
0	thank_you guys for what you offer the bodybuilding community .
0	very reliable and budget friendly !
0	fast shipping , reliable , awesome prices , you can '_t go_wrong with this store !
0	i would definitely recomend hostelbookers .
0	it is the only site i use when i am traveling .
0	it is incredibly user_friendly and super easy to search and compare different properties .
0	and they don_'_t charge a booking_fee which is awesome !
0	we purchased the samsung clp - 000nd , and what can i say , it '_s great .
0	we are a small business and we print out a lot of coloured brocures .
0	the printer is able to cope with the high_volume of prints .
0	we also have tested it with photo_paper and it hasn_'_t let us down .
0	this is a great machine to have as it is sturdy and small , just what you need in a small office .
0	the service was also great , once we sent the payment , we received an_email_saying that our printer would be out next_day , and it was !
0	jessica who dealt_with had great customer service skills and lovely to deal with .
0	good product
0	i '_ve worked with ali for a number of years_now and he '_s always been extremely_helpful .
0	he '_s incredibly knowledgeable on adwords and is always super quick to respond to requests .
0	highly_recommended .
0	was too ill to go to event but could not get a refund because of their policy which makes no sense given how there was a strong demand on tickets and so it '_s not like they '_d have made a loss . tried to sell my ticket to someone but couldn_'_t get through to anyone on the hotline to transfer the ticket to their name despite ringing for half an_hour and so not only was i home with flu feeling miserable whilst all my friends were out having fun i was paying £_00 for my trouble plus whatever my phone bill comes to so yeah , i '_m_sure there ' re good reasons for their policies but in this case they pretty_much robbed me for being sick .
0	i was extremely happy with my experience with glasses_direct .
0	i found them just by googling " glasses uk ," and i was really excited to learn that they would deliver trial_frames to try on for free !
0	i '_ve always been afraid of buying clothes or accessories online because you ' re never quite sure how they ' re going to look on , and something as expensive and defining as glasses would normally be a definite no - go for me .
0	those " upload a picture " schemes never really work right or tell you how the glasses will feel on .
0	however being_able to try them on in reality was amazing , and it was free to do , as often as you '_d like .
0	once i had decided on frames i liked , it was really easy to order and the prices were amazing .
0	i was able to get two_pairs of glasses for less_than i would normally spend on one .
0	they have lots of add_ons and options so you can do anything from very basic lenses to complicated bi_- focals for astigmatism with transition_lenses !
0	all at still very reasonable_prices too .
0	when the final product game ( much more quickly than i '_m used to when i order from my optometrist !)
0	i was extremely happy with them as well .
0	they both came in cases with a cloth , the prescription was spot_on and the fit was right !
0	i never have any trouble ordering off here !
0	i ordered my boyfriends xmas_present and it came the next_day
0	makes my life so much_easier !
0	thanks xxx
0	i placed my order on a dress on the 00 / 00 / 00 as boohoo had given me 00_%_off as it was my bday on the 00rd the money was debited on the same day and i was hoping to wear this dress on xmas day and i have emailed constantly only to have the same automated email i will never order again and want my money back !
0	they are so unprofessional it is a joke it make me never want to order online ever again !!!
0	!
0	after some_confusion_over products , the problem was fully solved .
0	very happy they got in touch and made the effort to sort it promptly .
0	i would , however , suggest you speak to your warehouse team or couriers about taking better care of paid for items and not rushing off so quick to give the customer a chance to check for damages else there could be many more people wanting to return .
0	otherwise , worldstores is a great place to buy from .
0	thanks
0	pleasant , fast .
0	will use again .
0	it was easy to use , nice sire .
0	will use again .
0	i have been very impressed with the service .
0	the product has_been finished to a high_standard and my order was delivered very efficiently .
0	the service was very professional and friendly and i would not_hesitate to use these_guys again .

0	birds baby showers
0	my item arrived very quickly and the website i very user_friendly !
0	i would continue buying from this website .
0	thank_you !
0	i ordered items for my iphone at the start of december .
0	i emailed in january to say the goods hadn_'_t arrived and all they responded was what is your full postal address .
0	i provided this and had to phone several days_later for an update .
0	seemingly the supplier sent the goods !!!
0	they offered to resend the items as they now had stock .
0	these replacement items coming first_class never arrived so a week_later contacted them .
0	no response .
0	a few_days_later i emailed again and asked for a refund .
0	yet again no response and no refund .
0	will be informing consumer council .
0	this company is atrocious and should not be allowed to trade .
0	they basically take customers money under false pretences and seem unprepared to communicate with customers .
0	loved the wedding_stationary .
0	the ribbon invites we ordered were beutiful .
0	had loads of complements off guests on our invites .
0	would definitely recommend
0	i had read poor reviews about this company so was a little_wary_about ordering through them .
0	however , the service i received was first_rate with the product arriving in good condition less_than 00_hours after_placing my order .
0	this site has a great range of products at decent prices and delivery was free !
0	i '_d definitely use deep_blue again .
0	appreciated for your friendly services , wish to have more pleasant shopping with you !
0	thank_you .
0	i stupidly signed_up to talktalk & a bt telephone engineer installed my new phone line at the bottom of my stairs even_though i said i wanted it in the living_room , he refused - he clearly couldn_'_t be bothered .
0	when i plugged in my router i had to use an_extension cable to fit in the plug for my phone & the plug for my router .
0	so i now have a massive tripping & fire hazard at the bottom of my stairs .
0	when i phoned up talktalk to complain_about this , i was told that if the engineer put it there then that is where it should stay !
0	so i complained to the ombudsman about this - still_waiting on a reply .
0	then my talktalk tv box arrived & to my horror , i realised that the tv must be plugged into my router - which is in the hall at the bottom of my stairs !
0	this doesn_'_t make_sense !
0	am
0	i supposed to drag my tv into the hall & watch it there !
0	i was then on the phone to talktalk for an_hour trying to get this resolved .
0	apparently i could just run extension cables into the living_room .
0	so my house is to become an even bigger danger .
0	eventually they agreed to move my phone line , i had to stay on the phone as they filled out the form for this request - apparently i have nothing better to do with my time .
0	i was told that an engineer would phone within_00hrs to arrange a date - that was 0_days ago .
0	so again , i phoned talktalk this morning , only to be told that they didn_'_t have an update of this on my account !
0	i was then told that it was passed to a manager & someone would phone today .
0	i don_'_t_believe they will phone .
0	i am sitting with no tv - even_though i am paying for it .
0	i have a fire & tripping hazard on my stairs & when i asked to cancel , i was told that i would have to pay cancellation charges !
0	this is ridiculous - this is all their fault .
0	they then had the cheek to phone me about taking out a talktalk mobile phone !
0	trying to complain to talktalk gets me nowhere - there online help is just trouble shooting & phoning gets me nowhere .
0	i plan to write to talktalk & give them bad_reviews where possible .

0	went a bit ott when ordering but it was well_worth it .
0	the coffee is great as an early morning kick or as a mid_morning break .
0	there are loads of different ones to choose from , whether it '_s just a normal coffee or a flavoured coffee whittards have it all .
0	thanks .
0	always had the lowest_prices and fast shipping .
0	i will keep using supplementwarehouse . com
0	we got some tickets for reading which were by far the cheapest tickets around !
0	not only this , all other_places had sold out of the tickets we wanted and double 0 got them to us really quickly .
0	i would have no_hesitation in recommending the site and am definitely going to use them again .
0	thanks double 0 !

0	i have to say that i am seriously impressed with the service that i have received from oak_furniture_land .
0	the quality of the products cannot be_faulted and i cannot remember the last time i received such an efficient delivery service .
0	the products were securely_packaged and the drivers took the items into my home and to the requested rooms with the utmost_respect for my property .
0	i cannot_sing this company ’_s praises_enough and i would urge_anyone considering using them to do so – you won ’_t regret it !!
0	!

0	a brilliant company to use for arranging a hen_night .
0	makes it very easy for everyone to pay and see the details .
0	i recommend using them if you have an event to arrange !
0	excellent as always .
0	although more info of whats in the box sets would be helpful i . e " perfume : 000ml ( eau_de parfume ) and 000ml : lotion " as i had to email to find that out .
0	no trouble at all .
0	well_packaged when arrived , and all my products were as ordered .

0	the reviews are good as well , i haven_'_t been disappointed yet !
0	a good friend recommended this course to me , so i decided to give it a go .
0	i found it enjoyable and easy to follow .
0	the information given was clearly and easily explained and was very much step for step through the course_material .
0	it would be nice to have a free access to the program for a time to be able to click and explore randomly on one '_s own without being part of an assessment or exercise .
0	but no_complaints here ...
0	i would recommend this course to anyone looking at developing their computerized accounting skills !
0	thanks e_- careers !
0	great website .
0	thanks very much
0	always giving out free money or free spins excellent customer service and good value for money xxx alias allboysmummy
0	will be using this site again , i '_m traveling around and making last_minute plans .
0	this worked_perfectly for my needs .
0	love that each_hostel is rated , listed with the price and availability is indicated .
0	one thing i had trouble with was using the map of listings on my tablet , it wouldn_'_t zoom for some reason .

0	booking with hostelbookers was a great experience !
0	it is extremely_helpful to be able to read so many reviews before choosing the best place to stay .
0	it is also easy to navigate and even easier to book .
0	no_hassles .
0	i would definitely recommend hostelbookers to others traveling !
0	hi !
0	i '_ve got a question about e_- ticket !

0	if you are an_avid player of online casino games , this should be your number one site to consider , it is safe and secured which means you do not have to worry_about scams , they even go_ahead to offer a special bonus for vip players , this site especially went further to offer many different payment options , especially credit_cards and ukash , also i received fast and helpful customer support which i would definitely recommend to friends and any new customer with a plan to join an online casino site also if you plan on switching casino sites i would greatly recommend you join magic red .
0	very good service - goods arrived in time and was well_packaged .
0	great range of products and the website is easy to navigate .
0	i have booked through prestigia . com for a riad marrakech and also booked a hotel in barcelona and everything went very well .
0	in fact , i paid a deposit and the difference was to be paid when you arrive at hotel .
0	in marrakech it all went good but at check out in barcelona , i went to pay the difference that was written on my voucher and they wanted to charge me the whole amount .
0	after showing them my voucher and making them call prestigia , they finally agreed with the amount left that i had to pay .
0	all in all a memorable experience .
0	kudos to prestigia !
0	!
0	i can '_t think of a bad thing to say about amazon .
0	a lot of their products have free_postage & packaging and most of the time i get my items delivered before the estimated_date .
0	i '_ve even had pre_- ordered products delivered a day or two before they '_ve been released .
0	their return_policy for faulty goods is 00 days after purchase ( which is fair_enough ) but they make no exception for christmas ( except with unopened items ).
0	after opening my new laptop on christmas day i knew it was faulty immediately but because it was bought ( but not used or opened ) in november , and the 00 days had passed , they wouldn_'_t let_me return it which i think is extremely stupid .
0	it '_s common knowledge that people don_'_t usually buy presents at the last_minute , nor do they open them before christmas day .
0	so there would '_ve been no way for me to know the product was faulty until it was too late .
0	definitely not shopping there again and i '_d recommend others to shop elsewhere too .
0	as soon as i got my laptop i could tell the cursor pad was off .
0	you would move it somewhere and it would fly right past it , then you '_d spend about a minute circling the link , trying to get the cursor on it but failing .
0	i was hoping to get it repaired or get a replacement laptop but was told by in store staff there was nothing wrong with it .
0	i now have a laptop i dread using and there '_s nothing i can do about it .
0	where to start !
0	in store the staff where nice and helpful it seems .
0	i have a habit of interegating when it comes to contracts , i repeatdly asked my questions to make_sure they couldnt loop hole me ... well turned_out he just plain lied !
0	it was only after i found out that i was unable to cancel the contract at all !
0	and to top it , after_speaking to three who the contract was also with , they told me it was bad practise what carphone_warehouse did .
0	now im paying for a 0 year contract i was explicitly assured i wouldnt end up paying if there was problems .
0	( the contract was for a friend in my credit_rating .. yes dont trust friends with money ) what actually happened was my friend canceled the payment and without_any notice i was immediatly paying them .
0	if i had known what i new now about my liability , i would never have agreed to help my friend .
0	my advise .. dont trust carphonewarehouse staff to tell the truth , they will blatently lie to your face for a sale .
0	i bought a photography lighting kit and after 0_weeks of hassle and 0 kits both broken they where trying to pawn me off with replacement bulbs .
0	after some discussion over checking the lights are fine before despatch is was clear they knew full well the whole stock where broken and still sold onto the customers !
0	at that point i demanded a refund !
0	i refuse to purchase from a company who does that to their customers !
0	part of me believes they might purposly buy lights with broken bulbs , as it easily happens , then they can get a cheaper price !
0	surely if a big company recieves broken goods they would get replacements from the manufacturer since they give them £ 0000 '_s .
0	however warehouse express seems quite happy to sell on these goods !
0	so 0_weeks_later i have no lights , mountains of stress and lost work from sitting in waiting for deliveries .
0	if your going to purchase from them dont expect a quality service !
0	i had my hen_party arranged by hen_heaven .
0	it made the arrangements so easy , i could send invites out by email and people could pay online taking away the stress of collecting .
0	the park plaza hotel was excellent it was a perfect central_location to all the pubs and shops .
0	it was a few_minutes_walk from the activity venue where we had the dirty_dancing experience - which i would completely recommend !
0	it was a great ice_breaker for our group .
0	we also had prepaid nightclub to oceanas which had different floors for different tastes so there was something for everybody .
0	hen_heaven have made my hen_weekend a completely_stress_free , amazing memory and we definately got our value for money !
0	let_me say the activities we had were great but the problem was with the accommodation !
0	on arrival we had a drink spillages down the walls , plastic stuck in plug_sockets , gone off milk spilt everywhere in the fridge so disgustingly potent and dry and crusty in the fridge it was that old !!!
0	dirty cup in the lounge , dirty plate in with the clean ones in the cupboard , smashed lamp shoved in the draws and a broken window in the main bedroom not just a crack but a full on hole !
0	terrible paint job where they have obviously had a leak in the main bedroom , so the walls were all yellow and obviously needs to be re - plastered and painted !
0	finally there was an immense amount of black mold along the top of the wall in the main_bathroom , absolutely_disgusting !!!!
0	we had someone from the company out to come and see all this which was fine to try and get it dealt_with , of which she assured me would be looked into and dealt_with and i would receive a response in regard to this matter .
0	but surprise i did not receive a reply and had to chase the matter myself , to only be dealt_with by neil stonehill apparent managing_director
0	of my big_fat brighton_weekend who states that " with regard to any other of these issues ( other than the window ) they were not pointed_out to him at the time "!
0	which is a total and utter lie , so let_alone do they let you have an disgustingly dirty accommodation ( which is not worth the money you pay ) they also imply that you are a liar !!!
0	there customer_services is a complete utter lie and i am absolutely_disgusted by how we have been treated in regard to this matter !
0	my best advise ... stay away if you want an enjoyable weekend in a good standard of accommodation !
0	!
0	horrendous customer service , i email to chase_up what '_s happening and the response is " we have nothing else to say " to which i reply " not even an_apology for the standard of the accommodation ?"
0	and the response was " no we have nothing else to say !"
0	so let_alone the terrible standard of the accommodation they won_'_t even apologise !!!
0	absolutely terrible !
0	ordered nearly_£_000 worth of goods for a garden party from partyrama .
0	they didn_'_t disappoint .
0	it was super_fast delivery , the good were as_described and in tip - top condition .
0	they even did ' buy in bulk ' for some items which cut the cost of our purchases substantially .
0	we '_d done alot of research on the internet prior to making our purchases , just to make_sure that we were getting a competative price .
0	i really trust them and will shop_here again .
0	the invitations arrived quickly after_placing my order on the company '_s website and were of an excellent finish .
0	no_complaints .
0	the staff here have great product knowledge and go out of their way to help .
0	excellent prices too and really fast delivery .
0	banana_fingers was recommended to me by a couple of friends when i needed to buy a new harness .
0	the prices were extremely competitive .
0	i also bought a brush for a friend to take_advantage of the free delivery offer if you spend of £_00 .
0	i placed my order sunday_afternoon and it arrived tuesday ( even_though i had only selected normal delivery , not next working day ), which was very impressive .
0	banana_fingers also kept me up to date with my order '_s status by email and text .
0	cannot_fault them one bit !
0	many_thanks .
0	fast and easy with lots of reviews on the hostel to see what it would be like .
0	no problem whatsoever , and personally checked against hostel_world prices ... cheaper on hostel_bookers for sure !
0	i will be using this again for sure .
0	hands_down the best supplement company out there .
0	not only do they beat the competition '_s prices by 0 %, they also have a huge_selection of samples ( who doesn_'_t like free_samples of products you want to try ?!?!?!)
0	shipping is ridiculously fast , i typically receive my orders within 00 - 00_hours of confirming transaction , that '_s unheard of !
0	i '_ve only had to use the customer service line once in 0 years , and not only was the representative kind and helpful , she also was very knowledgeable of other products and suggested i look into other brands for the supplements i was purchasing .
0	all i can say is thank_you supplement_warehouse , for all that you do !
0	we '_ve only just started working with the guys at pd and have been impressed with what we have seen .
0	we are a start up and need the hand holding and advice they offer without reservations .
0	we look_forward to working more with them in the coming months as we grow our business and would absolutely recommend them .
0	first_class hotel with top_class facilities excellent service could not have afforded such a fantastic top_class hotel for such a low price . i am in a wheelchair and i could not of asked for better assistance and the staff went out of their way to help in every way they could .
0	excellent hotel at an excellent ebookers price
0	excellent service
0	excellent product and very quick delivery !

0	i was trying to complete a review on their imdb website ( film review ).
0	they then started to ask me for my card_details !
0	really ?
0	when all i wanted to do was put what i thought of dodgeball 0 ?
0	their response email stated that the matter would be investigated , but they could not tell me the outcome of the investigation , for privacy reasons !
0	i challenged this and asked them to send a hard_copy letter in the post to be of their investigation findings .
0	next email they sent , consisted of them doing a very quick u - turn and saying they were wrong , no investigation would take place ( maybe because they realised they had been caught out after using the privacy excuse for years ).
0	they put they would not correspond with me further !
0	so if you ask any_questions and they don_'_t want to answer them , be prepared for them to just state they will not correspond with you anymore .
0	the information to literally put a film review on a site , was more than you be asked for if you were arrested by the police !
0	ridiculous and they lied in their second email and tried to hide_behind data_protection and privacy laws .
0	amazon and google are taking over the world .
0	be afraid , be very afraid .
0	i bought cosmetics from the leeds m & s store .
0	when i got home , i discovered that i had in fact picked_up an item which was in the wrong ' pigeon hole '.
0	i didn_'_t think i would stand a chance of any return , especially with this type of item and , to some extent , the error being partly my mistake .
0	i phoned and the assistant said there would be no issue and i could have an_instant refund .
0	in fact , they even asked if i had to pay for petrol or bus_fare and they would compensate me for this as well !
0	this is the best customer_services experience i have ever had from any store .
0	for anyone who may at any point in their lives wish to purchase anything from the exquisite emporium which is named argos :
0	always email them - but as with any other company , when they have the crap contact form that you can '_t keep a copy of ( handy that ), copy and paste into a word_document , with the date ( and time if possible as it is more imposing - not that the person in the store will even notice - that '_s if they can read - refer as far back as jasper carrott '_s 0000 vide if_necessary ), before pressing send .
0	when they respond to your email by phone , which may be for reasons where they do not want written evidence ; but is far more likely to be the fact that they have fingers too fat to type ; insist they confirm the content of the said conversation in some written format .
0	the reason being is that , when you eventually summon up the energy to return any item and have to stand in the inappropriately titled queue for ' customer information / returns ', it may go some way to prove that what you are saying is true .
0	if you do not heed my warning , be prepared for a member of staff to say to you that they " only have your word for it " when you state that the person_who phoned you said you don_'_t need a receipt even_though the item nearly burnt your house down and every one therein .
0	i took the standard part of the lamp , and the crumbled concrete base in a plastic_bag with me back to the local_store .
0	you will also get ' knowing ' looks as you have lost the receipt , so you may have been stolen the item and then returned it for the sum of £ 0 . 00 .
0	bearing in mind , argos must be about the only store where the items , apart_from those on display , are behind the front desk and in a store room .
0	if i was skilled enough to be able to access this room without anyone '_s knowledge , i would endeavour to obtain a 00 " lcd tv and would not have bothered to return it , unless " freddie the fence " had not been interested .
0	after the manager eventually agreed to phone customer_services , i was told there was ' no note ' on the system of me being offered a refund , despite the product not being fit for purpose and electrically faulty .
0	i went through the whole_procedure of giving my name , address etc , only to be handed an argos_card , not money .
0	i pointed_out to the assistant that the card was not in fact a refund .
0	i was told ' it was the same thing '.
0	i said it was not the same as a refund and was a credit_note .
0	i asked if it was the same as cash , i would be able to spend it anywhere !
0	he said i was lucky to get that , even_though the item caused fire damage and collapsed .
0	if , by some miracle , you have not lost the will to live after waiting 00_minutes and been called a liar , i suggest you purchase catalogue nr : 000 /_0000
0	disclaimer : no argos employees were hurt during the making of this email .
0	any resemblance to any employee being a cretin is purely coincidental .

0	my boyfriend ordered flowers from this company to give to me on valentine '_s day .
0	after being told to stay in the house and await a delivery they never came , so my boyfriend had to tell me what he was expecting .
0	i was appalled .
0	the flowers didn_'_t arrive until the 00th_february at about 0pm , by which time they were dead .
0	i wrote a lengthy email to the company telling them about the incident and how it was unacceptable that a flower delivery service could be so careless .
0	i received a dry and careless reply of about 0 words and then the status of my case was changed to ' closed .'
0	in my opinion , a flower delivery service that cannot be on time on valentine '_s day is just a disgrace .
0	yet , they barely bothered to say sorry .
0	to add salt to the wound they offered my boyfriend a voucher for £ 0 off his next purchase .
0	ha .
0	like we would ever use them again !
0	don_'_t touch this company with a barge_pole .

0	would recommend staying here !
0	pre orded ps0 console in plenty of time to get on release day as surprise gift for husband .
0	then was going to leave it up to him to buy games as i cannot_afford them as well .
0	then a few_weeks before launch ( when to late to pre order from anywhere_else ) was then advised that to be able to get order i would havd to change to a package including an extra controller which he would never use for extra £_00 .
0	ish or game and controller for extra £_000 . 00 ish .
0	so i had to ruin the surprise to be able to borrow money off husband and know what game to get .
0	felt bullied_into buyinv more than i wanted .

0	super_fast delivery , great product , what else can i wish for ?
0	our pens and usb disks arrived ontime and are of a good quality , we will be placing further orders when we have the budget in place .
0	not as high a price as some other_sites but guaranteed amount paid and very quickly the money was in my bank .
0	the website was easy to use , clear on what i was booking , not many steps to complete the booking , couldn_'_t ask for more
0	customer service = terrible
0	systems = terrible
0	compensation = terrible
0	i can not recommend lowcostholidays enough - uk call_centres and excellent service - switch you won_'_t regret it !
0	i first booked a holiday with expedia 0 years_ago to l . a . and i had problems when they charged my credit_card and debit_card ( saying the former had failed so i paid again ).
0	i was charged by my bank interest on the expensive holiday until it was all sorted .
0	the 0_weeks it carried on was very stressful and instead of sending me compensation for the bank charges they sent me £_000 voucher for expedia - who i would never go with again !
0	suffice to say i never used it .
0	0 years later and i messed_up and stupidly thought it might be a one off ( from looking at other online reviews i can see it is not !).
0	i got sent an_email to say i needed to add baggage to my flight ( already done ) i emailed three_times ( no response ), i then called the customer service ( call_centre in india , very , very rude and unhelpful ).
0	they told me i needed to speak to easyjet .
0	i explained i had paid expedia and booked through them so i needed them to look into .
0	the holiday was very expensive and adding baggage is only £_00 per_person , you '_d think they would say so sorry about this .
0	we '_ve called easyjet and modified your booking and you '_ll get an_email_confirmation later today .
0	instead all i '_ve had is an_email from easyjet - again saying i have no baggage .
0	i will now have to email them direct .
0	they make what should be something to look_forward to really stressful .
0	don_'_t book with them .
0	for the sake of £_000 - 000 use someone_else .
0	hate to say it but when you have a uk call_centre they listen to the problem and sort it for you .
0	[_name_] was a great help !
0	was really quick and efficient to my queries !
0	great , fast delivery and very happy with products and price x
0	i was very impressed from_start to finish , kept in the loop at all times and i have been told that the flowers were the most beautiful they had ever received : ) will be using again for sure !

0	moneysavingexpert is one of the best sites i know of .
0	i signed_up for their email tips immediately , and i have managed to bag some brilliant deals .
0	as with any site with a forum , there is always the odd bod who you don_'_t get along with , but as a general rule i have had no trouble there whatsoever .
0	the mods are quick at their jobs , and do them with a polite and friendly air ( as_opposed to treating posters as though they are peons ).
0	i have mistakenly posted threads in the wrong place , and it has_been with a polite little note to let_me know i '_ve done so that the mods have moved and / or closed the thread .
0	i can highly , highly_recommend moneysavingexpert to absolutely anyone and everyone .
0	vistaprint is a useful site for me as a budding avon rep whose hands cramp something chronic after writing out my information 000 times on the order forms .
0	i have been able to pick_up a rubber stamp at a reasonable_price , and was lucky_enough to catch the free_postage offer this time around .
0	i do rather object to the almost constant_emails i have been receiving , however .
0	vistaprint , i will buy what i want when i want and need it , i do not need to be showered with emails about " special_offers just for you !!!
0	", which nine times out of ten are entirely irrelevant to me .
0	i will keep shopping there , because the products i have received * have * been of good quality ( and i really do need the stamps !).
0	i will be attempting business_cards next .
0	all - in - all , if you can handle getting a plethora of emails a couple of times a week , vistaprint are a good place to pick things up from .
0	this website is a goldmine of handy - dandy things that a new mum ( like myself ) can find useful .
0	there are plenty of money - off vouchers to make the pennies stretch further , and other mums in the forums to chat to and share various tips with .
0	getting the little packs at sainsbury '_s is also fantastic , as you get a tu voucher to go towards getting clothing for the little monster ( s ) in your life .
0	it is very daunting being a first - time mum , and bounty goes a long way to giving support and advice to them , be you a mum with a significant other or a mum striking out on your_own .
0	great help , all the info i needed .
0	thanks .
0	i have used glasses_direct before and am always over the moon with the glasses i receive .
0	last time i ordered from them last_year there was an issue regarding the ' free tint ' offere they were running at the time .
0	rinning customer_services proved useless but my issue was dealt_with once i emailed .
0	i have recently had my eyes retested and found that my prescription had altered slightly so looked again at glasses_direct , all the frames i liked seemed pricey so i decided to try a few frames on a home_trial basis and wait for a groupon_voucher to come up .
0	luckily i didn_'_t have to wait long and the same day my voucher came through i received an_email from glasses_direct saying they had a 00_%_off frames offer .
0	brilliant i thought , suddenly the frames i thought were out of my price range were affordable so i promptly ordered another home_trial to check the frames i wanted and placed an order .
0	unfortunately , like last time , the promotion was misleading and not available in conjunction with my groupon_voucher .
0	this put me in a difficult position as i had already paid for the groupon_voucher and so felt that rather_than waste the money on that i had to make the purchase .
0	i could have chosen less expensive frames but didn_'_t want to be stuck with frames i didn_'_t like .
0	i am now looking_forward to receiving my new frames , am just disappointed that once again i '_ve felt let_down by the incentives to purchase .
0	i enjoyed the way the website is set_up .
0	it allowed me to shop and re - evaluate my order for days , all before having to create an account .
0	i am absolutely_delighted with my recent_purchase from pet_supermarket .
0	the product choice was superb and i received my royal_canin cat_food within 0_days of ordering !
0	fantastic - thanks !

0	i was sceptical_about ordering glasses online .
0	wow !
0	i don_'_t think i '_ll ever buy from an opticians again .
0	the service is brilliant and easy .
0	they came on time and just want i wanted .
0	this could lead to a large collection of glasses .
0	i had no_problems getting what i ordered .
0	happy with the services
0	i '_d use this company again , it was hassle_free .
0	ordered some items on offer for ' click and collect ' items were available for the collection from my chosen store the following_day .

0	not even worth a 0_star in my opinion , placed an order with river_island on the monday to receive a message on the tuesday to say my order had been dispatched !
0	great i thought will have the items in time for the weekend .
0	wednesday_morning received a text_message " your order will be delivered today via hermes " my heart sunk as i have has issues in the pass with this company via new look and asos but thought_id track the item and give them the benefit of the doubt .
0	wednesday_afternoon comes and goes , no parcel !!
0	so i was tracking my item all day and thought fair_enough they state they deliver until_0pm , so come 0 . 00pm when i track the order again the status had updated to " 00 . 00 courier to re - attempt "
0	now im sitting in the office with colleagues and no one tried to deliver that parcel , i even phoned river_island at the time to explain i was sat facing the window ( as we can see when cars and vans enter ) and no one tried to deliver anything , so where on earth were they with my order of over_£_000 ?
0	?
0	so thursday comes i receive another txt_message " your item will be delivered today " tracked my order again as you do !!
0	nothing all afternoon , phoned the customer service team at river_island around 0 . 00pm to explain that we are in the office and no delivery has_been made .
0	now do i sit around waiting for the same thing as yesterday to happen or do i just cut my loses and go home !
0	no i wait in the office with the cleaners until_0pm still no delivery .
0	now this is a business address fair_enough they deliver up until_0pm but how many offices are open pass 0pm .
0	when i track the order again at home they update the status to attempted delivery 0 . 00pm .
0	it is now day 0 and i am still_waiting for my delivery , the company is pathetic , and its so sad to say unless im having items delivered home ( as im at work for most of my life it makes_sense to have items delivered here ) im going to have to avoid using online_retailers that use this company , they are so incompetent , they also make out to the retailer that they have attempted delivery when that is a blatant_lie .
0	it is then hard to prove to the retailer that you are in the building at the time when they supposedly tried to deliver !!
0	thus meaning you could lose out on delivery costs being refunded !
0	!
0	useless company , avoid at all costs , if you do find your parcel has_been dispatched with them dont expect too much !
0	!
0	i have recently_purchased a few eye_shadow and blending brushes from crownbrush . co . uk and they are great , ive seen mixed_reviews on theses brushes but for me they are great , really soft and for the price i really cant_complain and i will defiantly be purchasing a few more .
0	also the service is great delivery came within 0_days .
0	the only con i would say is they need to update the delivery section on there site , so it is more accurate !
0	ive been in to poppy and zach so many_times_now !
0	the kids_love it .
0	having 0 children and 0 of them being twins its sometimes hard to please each child and even more so to find something to suit every budget !
0	the converse are my kids top choice in there at the moment as there are loads of choice in colour !
0	having twins that are so identical we colour code them ... red converse and blue converse .... my girls also love the choice !
0	thing is you go in for one thing ... and come out with so much more !
0	there is a little " kiddy " corner where the kids can chill and watch a dvd and play while you shop too !
0	... perfect for those little_ones who dont always share mummy love of browsing for toooo long haha !
0	all i can finish with is i have children age 0 , 0 , 0 and 0 and all 0 of them love the place . perfect for presents birthdays and any other occasion !

0	hi recently bought a horse from ireland and couldnt_believe the difference_between what hsbc said the exchange_rate was and what the bbc website said .
0	so i did some_research on google and found fxcompared . com who recommended the fx_firm as the cheapest .
0	i put an equiry into the website and was called straight_away .
0	i have my money in ireland on the same day and it was about £_000 cheaper .
0	very fast service , very good rate and i highly_recommend them .
0	i ordered over the holiday_period so wasn_'_t expecting them too quickly but after a quick email i got a swift reply and they came the next_day .
0	good quality glasses at very good prices .
0	i will probably buy another pair later in the year .

0	warning : if you order then be aware you may never see your money again .
0	please , anyone who is in this situation who has ordered from these_guys and been through the frustrating proceedure to try and get your money back please report them to trading_standards and watchdog .
0	nearly two months later i still have not had a refund of the £_00 i paid for a meal which never turned_up .
0	i am so sick of trying to get my money back only to be met with ridiculous excuses .
0	i reported these_guys to watchdog as i was so sick of them and have given up trying to get my money back .
0	i had been using just eat for a while and we usually used the same couple of restuarants .
0	this time we chose another one and my order was accepted and my money taken from my account .
0	it never turned_up .
0	i phoned the restaurant and hour and a half myself and they said no order for my address had been placed , just eat said they would refund me but over 0_weeks_later i have still had no refund .
0	i will not be using them again .
0	i think it is wrong to have money taken from my account and expected to wait for weeks to get it back when nothing was even ordered .
0	now two months on i still have not had my money back .
0	be prepared to lose money .
0	these people are very dodgy .
0	i got my first set of music from sheetmusicdirect ( so i know it wasnt my mistake ) and ordered and paid for a second lot .
0	it never arrived so i contacted them and did not get any reply .
0	i would not recommend these_guys for your music if they can '_t be bothered to reply to customer emails .
0	great service from mazuma_mobile ,

0	jv carpentry outshone our expectations in the building of our alcove bookcase .
0	when jeff came over to quote we were impressed by his attention to detail , particularly in suggesting finishes that would tie in with other woodwork in the room .
0	it is obvious he knows his craft inside out and maintains high_standards yet his prices are comparable with other quotes we received .
0	the company were in our flat building the bookcase within 00_hours of measuring up and they built it within a day while we were at work .
0	we are absolutely_delighted with the construction and paint finish and would thoroughly_recommend the company to anyone looking for quality workmanship .
0	thank_you !

0	received an_email from wowcher advertising 0_* 0 holiday to madrid .
0	as it was my birthday last_week i thought that would be a great last_minute deal to use for me to then go away as a birthday treat with my best friend .
0	once i had purchased the wowcher it asks you to follow a link , fill in the form and someone will contact you .
0	when i was contacted to arrange dates , all the dates i mentioned were either unavailable , or will cost me additional_fees , although the dates i stated were within the wowcher terms .
0	i told the travel company i cant understand_why i should pay more , all they came back with was they could fit me on a flight which was not any of the dates i wanted but i would also have to depart from luton and return to gatwick !
0	i told them i wanted to speak to wowcher and the next_day after buying the deal i sent wowcher an_email requesting a refund as this deal wasnt meeting its description .
0	in the meantime over the weekend i had 0 calls from the travel company telling_me if i dont book something i will lose my money .
0	they also spoke in a threatening manner towards my sister when i wasnt in to take a call from them .
0	i rang wowcher saturday after emailing again requesting a refund and told them all that had happened , but as the office was closed all i could do was leave a message with admin and they will pass my query on urgently .
0	i contacted wowcher again monday ( yesterday ) lunchtime as i hadnt_heard_anything , but again i was talking to admin and she said if i had spoken to someone saturday and he marked it as urgent i should receive a call back yesterday or today , if not i was advised to call again to then raise this with a supervisor !
0	i have heard_nothing , hence me writing this essay as it seems to be the only way to get an answer .
0	from reading_reviews , im not alone with issues regarding this deal .
0	all i want is my money back and for this stressful_situation to me resolved !
0	please someone help , surely doing everything i can my side shouldnt be hard to just get my money back .

0	i had never spent a considerable_amount of money online on a product i had not seen in the flesh and was a bit_wary_about it .
0	i had absolutely no need to worry .
0	the camera i received was everything i expected and more .
0	i got a great deal with the camera , a 00g memory_card , 0 year_warranty , a case and vouchers for free prints and canvases only 0 pounds more than the price of the camera alone on amazon .
0	i chose free delivery , estimated in 0 working_days , i ordered it on thursday_evening and received it at work on monday_morning , i was fully charged and out snapping on my lunch_break .

0	i would like to mention that i had a chat with a very competent advisor named richard .
0	he knew everything i needed to know , and was quick to help me out and advise me on the best possible service for my needs .
0	i wish there were more people like him , who are competent and straight the point when good advice is needed promptly .
0	richard is an_asset to parcel0go , and i do wish his abilities , strengths and positive contributions to this company are recognised .
0	richard is the type of individual that i would gladly recruit to work in my own company .
0	item came on time , postage was excellent , customer service was super .
0	this is the worst phone network i '_ve ever been with .
0	over the past 00 months i have had the worst service including failure of three to keep their end on the contract , constant rude & unhelpful staff , and complaints that have been ' lost ' on their system with no record of the phone_call .
0	i have now reached the end of my contract .
0	i called three a few_weeks_ago and they confirmed that my contract_ends on jan 0st 0000 .
0	i was informed that my final direct_debit would be 00th_jan_0000 .
0	when i hung_up the call i received a text from three stating " you '_ve upgraded to essential internet sim at a cost of 0 . 00 a month ."
0	i did not agree to any upgrade of the phone .
0	on the 0nd of jan ( today ) i was debited the full £_00 from my account .
0	i have called again to confirm that i want my contract to end , no upgrade and confirmation of my final payment date .
0	after following the automated instructions it stated my contract end date is february 00th 0000 !!!!
0	where did they get this from ?!!!
0	i have not agreed nor signed anything !!!
0	after getting through to a staff_member i was told their systems are down and to call back in 0 hours .
0	i will be calling back in 0 hours to ensure they correct all of this and send me a letter in writing confirming my contract has ended .
0	i have contacted citizens_advice bureau .
0	if three continue to con me and create contracts i have not agreed to then i will be reporting them to ofcom and failing that , will take legal_action !
0	liars , cheats & thieves !!

0	excellent easy to use website , good price and speedey delivery .

0	absolutely cracking company , was a little_bit_worried as £_000 for two_pairs of designer_glasses just seemed too good to be true !
0	there was an extra 00_%_off offer on the frames too so saved another £_00 on top as well .
0	first time using them and had arrived by saturday ordered on the monday !
0	thinned_down , uva , scatch resistant too :).
0	absolutely_gorgeous pairs ( both scout thick rims ).
0	only problem is there a little_bit wide but i think thats just because i have a small head !
0	definitely going to be where i '_ll be ordering my glasses from now on !
0	very prompt service .
0	all items arrived within a short time , all in excellent condition .

0	so it '_s my husband and his best friends birthday .
0	his best mate chose a restaurant in chalk farm .
0	i searched lastminute . com for places in chalk farm .
0	the third on the list was a secret location .
0	i purchased due to the insinuation if location .
0	i later come to find that it is in greenwich !!!
0	i paid with the last bits if money i had ( we have 0 boys and just wanted one night away ).
0	they have outright refused to correct their misrepresentation and our misfortune .
0	our whole weekend is ruined and i feel like our money has_been stolen .
0	i like amazon , they always offer a great range of items ( sometimes more than play . com ) and have always delivered and i '_ve been using them for years .
0	cant go_wrong .
0	nitrotek are great .
0	i loved the website and the fact they offer a help line whenever you need them for follow_up care and advice .
0	i received my expensive item within a few_days and i was chuffed to pieces with it as its an xmas_present for my partner .
0	really impressed and feel i will_definatley order from them again .
0	order no .
0	000000000 .
0	superfast delivery , excellent communication , items are tracked through the whole_process from leaving the warehouse to arriving at your door .
0	any_queries are dealt_with fairly and efficiently .
0	very polite and professional .
0	great items at affordable_prices , perfect for resale .
0	i would like to say that the man who_owns this company , karl , prides himself on his customers being 000_% satisfied , any_issues , he will resolve personally ( not a service you receive with all companies that do as much business as this ) !
0	a pleasurable_experience , i will_definately purchase from here again and would recommend to everyone !
0	had to contact them as account locked out .
0	immediately got through to catherine on the live_chat and my account was unlocked within a minute and i was able to continue processing orders .
0	fastest and most polite customer service i have received in a long time .
0	after a few bad_experiences with online shopping i am always a little_wary but beauty_cow was recommended to me by a friend as i was looking to order ghd '_s for a birthday_present and wad looking for the best deal i could get at £_00 with free delivery that is exactly_what i got from beauty_cow obviously as they were for a present there was a deadline for delivery but , they turned_up within 0_days - plenty of time before the birthday meaning i wasnt stressed out waiting on delivery i will definetley be using beauty_cow again and also recommending them to my friends x
0	i left booking a trip for me and a dozen mates to the last_minute and hostel_bookers saved the day and had 00 beds available in a san_francisco hostel .
0	avoid this company at all costs !

0	i had been looking for a while for the right sofa and i thought i had found it at dfs brentford .
0	the salesman was very quick to say " yes madam , no problem " to all of my requests .
0	( at no point were we offered a site survey ) the sofa was due to be delivered in 0_weeks .
0	0_weeks_later i called dfs brentford to track our order , it would be delivered into the store in a few_days .
0	delivery was arranged for the following week between 0pm and 0pm .
0	knowing this we donated our old sofas to charity ready for our delivery the following_day .
0	after arranging for somebody to house sit for the delivery the sofas finally arrived at 0pm an_hour late !
0	and to our horror it didn_'_t fit through our front_door - not impressed !!
0	the following_day my husband contacted the brentford store and was advised that 00_% of re attempts get in , so he rearranged delivery for the next date avaliable which was 0_days after the first_attempt !
0	in the mean time my family of 0 had no sofas !
0	again i arranged for somebody to be home between 0pm and 0pm , we requested as late as possible .
0	the delivery arrived at 0 : 00 , luckily i had arranged for somebody to be at home early !
0	the delivery man took one look and said " no chance , but i will give it my best shot ", which to be fair to him he did .
0	again no fit !
0	disappointed is a serious understatement !
0	so my husband spoke to the brentford store and they arranged for us to meet james the manager the following evening , we arrived at the store to find out that james was not there !
0	we were advised that we could make the sofa into a 0 piece but it would cost an extra hundred_pounds and take another 0_weeks minimum to make it !!
0	a note was left for james to call us the next_morning , but we heard_nothing !
0	so my husband called in the afternoon and finally spoke with james .
0	he said that he would arrange for a loan sofa to be with us by the weekend , which was essential as we had guests visiting .
0	i was then contacted by head_office and they said that the earliest delivery of the loan sofa was monday .
0	by now this is two_weeks without a sofa , and guests coming with nowhere to sit !
0	!
0	enough was enough so i went in to the brentford store to cancel my order to be told that i can only do this with james and he was busy .
0	i waited for over 00_minutes and nothing !
0	his new sales was clearly way more important !
0	so i left , i have a busy family life and run a business - i do not have time for a company who simply do not value their customers !!
0	i returned home to call head_office to find out the only way to cancel the order is in store !
0	!
0	i have never_experienced_such appalling service in all of my life , and will be advising everybody i know to never ever use dfs !!!
0	!
0	i love boohoo :) whenever i need anything i come straight to boohoo and they exceed my expectations and i don_'_t have to worry_about the cost .
0	i must_admit though the sizes are a bit small so go a size up if you are not sure .. all in all excellent place to pick_up some style .
0	oh and the customer_services is fantastic !
0	recently_purchased 0 pairs of climbing_shoes .
0	they were both the wrong_size and had to both be exchanged for bigger_sizes .
0	the order is always processed very quickly and delivery is just as quick .
0	returned smaller_sizes to bananafingers thursday 00th_march and received the new sizes on monday 00th_march !
0	now that is good service !!!!
0	the staff is very helpful and friendly .
0	called to ask something about the climbings shoes i bought and the staff were very informative and the customers services is one of the best i have experienced in a very long time !
0	will definitely use bananafingers again and again and again !!!
0	!
0	thank_you . fast service .
0	a lovely online store with lots of information on their products which i greatly_appreciated and they have yummy chocolates .
0	^^ great service and an easy to use website .
0	i definitely recommend them :)
0	other than the awesome stuff they sell , these_guys go the extra_mile to make your purchase special .
0	the packaging was amazing and looked like it had been sent from ankh - morpork .
0	totally brilliant , i like supporting these_guys as much as i enjoy shopping with them :_d
0	i found this company to be far more resonably_priced than_anywhere_else so far .
0	my items were well_packaged and arrived very quickly .
0	i was surprised at how fast .
0	the site is easy to shop too , so a very pleasant shopping_experience .
0	don_'_t be surprised if you end up with a rather full basket after intending to look for just one item ^^
0	will definitely buy from them again .
0	they have a nice selection of stuff , it was easy to buy and pay and delivery was quck .
0	will definitely shop with grindstore again .
0	i found the whole_process appalling , from being given incorrect information initially , to being passed from person to person when i tried to make a complaint , to cancelling the whole order and receiving a telephone_call 0_days after the cancelation informing_me of the delivery date .
0	there is a complete_lack of ownership , customer service and product knowledge .
0	as a regular installer of the bathrooms the time wasted on this matter makes dealing_with my tub not viable in the future .
0	we decided to go to v_fest a couple of weeks_ago we looked online and double0 had the cheapest tickets amazing vaule and delivered a week b0 the festival 0_* service wood defo buy from double 0 again !

0	i have never sent flowers before so i have no comparison for this service but it completely exceeded my expectations !
0	right from recognition of order to the delivery of the flowers to my friend i received notification of the status of my order , both via_text and e_- mail , which i found a very reassuring for a service that i have never used before .
0	although i never saw the final product my friend said that they were beautiful .
0	i am still_waiting to hear how yummy the chocolates are .
0	i use the next_day delivery service which was a complete bargain compared to the extortionate_amount of money other_sites are charging !
0	i would definitely highly_recommend serenata and use again .
0	thank_you so much !

0	bought something in store and went back the next_day to return it .
0	the shop assistant refused to give me a refund because the item had just gone on sale .
0	i said i wasn_'_t happy about this as it didn_'_t say anywhere on the receipt or on the website that they don_'_t refund sale items and i wasn_'_t told when i bought it .
0	he said i could only have a gift card so i just took it with the intention of complaining to customer service at head_office .
0	the replies i got were unhelpful , stupid and from different people every time .
0	it started off well , with someone saying that i was entitled to a full cash refund back onto my card and the yasked for my receipt details , then it all went_downhill .
0	the next person said " i can see from the transaction that you paid with a gift card so we can '_t refund you " - absolute_rubbish as i have proof i paid with a visa_debit .
0	i was then told " as you accepted the gift card we can '_t refund you "...
0	if i hadn_'_t accepted the gift card they '_d probably now spout the bull that it '_s now gone past 00 days since the time of purchase .
0	i went back into the store and showed them the email i got that proved i was entitled to a proper refund .
0	it was a different shop assistant this time and she refused , was rude , and refused to tell me the name of the shop assistant that served me the first time .
0	tried_phoning numerous_times and they just never answer .
0	absolute morons and fraudulent company with crap quality clothes .

0	return transfer in mallorca didn_'_t turn_up but after persistent emails to resorthoppa customer_services we were given a refund for the taxi_fare we had to pay for to get to the airport on time .
0	not sure what the story would be if we had missed our flight .
0	i think it '_s important people realise resorthoppa are an agency for transfer companies so its not entirely their fault if a company is bad , they obviously do need to scrap some in mallorca altogether if they don_'_t sort things out though .
0	we followed the procedure of confirming our pickup times etc .
0	everything was confirmed , we had the pickup time of 00 . 00 .
0	well 00 . 00 came and went .
0	got to 0 . 00 and we started_panicking , tried to call the " emergency contact number " over 00 times and it just had an announcement in spanish on the other end .
0	we got a spanish speaker to help us and we found out the so called emergency_number was just a mobile phone turned off .
0	it was like this all day .
0	we tried every other number that funnily_enough stopped_working , even_though it was fine the day before when we used it to confirm our pickup times .
0	it was like the transfer supplier had decided to just take a day off and turn off all their phones .
0	customer service has_been good since we sent in a complaint , shame that the transfer company in mallorca is unreliable and the actual service wasn_'_t provided .

0	valentine '_s day present didn_'_t arrive .
0	twitter account said it would definitely be delivered by 0 . 00pm .
0	well 0 . 00pm came and went and still no parcel .
0	the delivery office said the twitter account admin had no way of knowing this because they couldn_'_t actually get_hold of the driver , so they lied .
0	absolutely useless .
0	you can '_t order anything online and feel_confident it will be delivered on time if the company use yodel as their couriers .
0	i have no idea how they are still getting business .
0	i would rate this company higher then 0_stars if i could .
0	where to start , the lovely frames , the free home_trial or the super pricing .
0	the pricing can not be beat , two glasses for £_00 is just excellent compared to some of the silly high_street prices .
0	we completed an order for my husband after he found the two frames he loved from the free home_trial .
0	we both loved the fact that you can tailor the glasses separately so were able to buy him glasses for work and persriciption sunglasses on the same offer ( just paying for the extras ).
0	when the glasses were received they were excellent even came with glasses case too .
0	we have since performed two addition orders another of hubby , for spares ( he was gutted when he left his glasses in a pub in london ) and a pair of glasses and sunglasses for me .
0	for a supermarket that makes itself out to be the best in the country i have had a really poor experience with sainsburys from_start , and i would say to finish but my ordeal is not over yet .
0	it started when i ordered some groceries online .
0	normally i use tesco but i thought i would give sainsburys a try .
0	i asked for them to deliver the products on a saturday_afternoon , and when they did the driver refused to give them to my husband .
0	my husband contacted me and told me and i went home to call sainsburys to tell them i was now in .
0	this was at 0pm .
0	at 0pm a representative from sainsburys called me back to inform_me that the drivers had all gone home and i would now recieve my order on monday .
0	i said i didn_'_t want it on monday .
0	the stuff for my sunday_roast was on the van !
0	they then offered me a tuesday delivery and i said no , i wanted a refund .
0	they said ok and told me it would take between 0 - 00 days to reach my account .
0	0_weeks have passed and after numerous_calls and emails they have now asked me for my bank_statements to proove i have not had the refund .
0	not at all what i expected .
0	from the attitude of the woman that called me from the denton store through to their shirty emails , i am not at all impressed .
0	now i am waiting on word from them to say they have recieved my statements .
0	wish me luck .
0	as with many of the posts , i too was looking to purchase a samsung_tv from currys after it went into sale .
0	well ... as always , too good to be true and their stock_levels were wrong and i was left without a tv .
0	online reliant_direct came up with the same price for the same tv , and as i had nothing to loose , decided to order from them .
0	at first i was a little_dubious , as simon also called me to say the stock wasn_'_t there and would offer me the brand_new 0000 model for a fraction more .
0	it sounded too good to be true , but as he was so friendly and gave no sales_pressure , i felt_reassured that it was the right thing to do .
0	never have i felt that i am ripping_off a company for the deal they are giving me !!
0	!
0	two_days before it was due to be delivered , simon called to confirm delivery time ( 0 :_00pm on saturday to be precise !
0	), and .... sure enough ..... the driver called on the sat_morning at 00 : 00 to say he '_d be there in 00mins !!!
0	bang_on the dot !!!
0	friendly driver .
0	brought it into the house and was happy to wait whilst we checked it .
0	i have one word left to say ...... faultless !
0	i was told about ditto by someone_who had dealt_with them previously and was happy with the results .
0	a small but efficient , creative , friendly , down to earth yet professional , patient , flexible , modern team of designers , who worked with us every_step of the way from a scrawled initial concept to the finished_product ; in this case labels , catalogues and business_cards .
0	so much attention to detail and care went into our order as is obvious from the end_result .
0	if we wanted to change something minor in the design , it was never a problem for the team , and they also offered useful , relevant advice where appropriate .
0	our branding has undergone a total transformation thanks to ditto and business is all the better for it .
0	now we are another happy customer , and will be recommending ditto to anyone who needs to give their brand a makeover !
0	i honestly can '_t rate them highly_enough :_o_)
0	a week_ago i ordered a crocodile costume for my son '_s school assembly .
0	i needed it quickly so i chose next_day delivery .
0	sure enough the costume arrived bright and early the next_morning - no_complaints there , although i do think £ 0 for delivery is a bit much !
0	( oops , i think that was a complaint !)
0	anyway , my son came home from school eager to try the costume on before the assembly .
0	normally i dont mind him wearing fancy_dress at home but this was a big mistake .
0	the costume shed little green hairs everywhere he went .
0	a week ( and several_times around with the vacuum ) later and i '_m still finding them .
0	so straight after the assembly i had to lock the costume away in a cupboard and it won_'_t be seeing the light of day again .
0	a [ 0 - year - old ] crying shame !
0	quick delivery and very happy with the product
0	item arrived in perfect_condition , and postage was even promoted to 0st_class next_day delivery for free .
0	very good customer service and excellent after service .
0	00 / 00
0	not satisfied at all as delivery was paid for 00 hour delivery and it turned_out to be 00_hours !
0	would recommend it to everyone .
0	great service , fast shipment .
0	i used funktion_events for booking my sisters_hen_do , after_searching the internet for what seemed like weeks i came_accross funktion , they had numerous deals available and were considerably_cheaper_than other_companies , not only were they cheaper but once i had received a quote from them i wasnt bombarded with emails and phone_calls pushing me to book with them .
0	the staff were extremely friendly and kept me in the loop throughout the booking stage , as i had to book for 00 women it made the process very easy and whenever i rang funktion it took them seconds to familiarise themselves with the hen_do that i was planning rather_than having to wait and speak to someone_who had no idea what i was talking_about .
0	i was extremely impressed as well as i had 0 pregnant ladies attending the hen_do and funktion advised me on only putting down a deposit and not booking them on the hen_do til the last_minute and as a result one of the pregnant ladies didn_'_t end up attending , this saved her from losing any money , this is the standard of service you can come to expect from funktion_events , putting the customer first .
0	finally ( i know this is long ) the event itself was amazing all the girls had a fabulous time at the cocktail_making session ( everyone got very drunken which made it very cheap ) even those that couldnt drink ( staff were very accomodating to the expecting hen ) the food was delicious , served in a timely_manner both the accommodation and cocktail_making / 0 course_meal venue had obviously been chosen for the standard of service they offer because the quality was unbelievable for the price , the hotel was beautiful , staff were friendly and every_aspect of the hen_do had been extremely well_organised and excellent value for money .
0	sorry for the lenghly review but i would definately_reccommend funktion_events to anyone looking to book a hen_do .
0	hostelbookers is a resource i find invaluable when planning trips .
0	it '_s always the first site i go to because the interface is intuitive and simple while still going one step further to intelligently suggest options i may not have thought of for planning my trip .
0	i recommend it highly and will keep_coming_back !
0	using nortlander for the first time was easy and very simple , communication was impeccable with fast response for all our needs .
0	all the accommodation and resources described previously to the trip were exactly_what was expected to the highest_standard and very good value for money .
0	minor organisational problems close to the time of the trip , but were soon explained and resolved .
0	i would definitely recommend using nortlander and would 000_% return !
0	very good !!
0	!
0	not the best prices but the best choice .
0	some really hard to find gifts on here .
0	take a look .
0	best price i found on the hello_kitty camcorder i wanted for my daughter .
0	ordered in plenty of time for christmas , but i didnt need to worry as i have already had it .
0	thanks so much !
0	this site was so helpful and easy to navigate .
0	it was a bunch cheaper_than booking through the actual site and i got to compare features of hostels to make_sure i chose the right one for me !
0	i have ordered cat_food from this company 0 - 0 times .
0	i find that many " mainland " uk companies charge ridiculous_amounts of money to send things to northern_ireland which negates the benefits of shopping around online for a good deal .
0	in comparison this company charges a reasonable rate (£ 0 ) and the parcel arrived in good time by courier .
0	the prices of the cat_food were also competitive
0	before i switched my supplier to mdp , i thought garment printing was laborious and really quite tricky .
0	little did i know , that actually all i needed was to switch to mdp_supplies and i would realise just how simple they make it !
0	i mainly use hot flex and the results are simple fantastic .
0	i have had many a compliment from new customers about how easy to wash and care for garments are now that i am using this vinyl .
0	so easy to weed , and prints like a dream .
0	thank_you mdp_supplies for restoring my faith entirely in the garment printing business !
0	i recently done a excel master course with e_- careers , and i found it very helpful .
0	originally i booked it just to supplement my current job , but i learnt so much more .
0	the learning platform is simple and easy to use .
0	it is very interactive , and you can go as slow or fast as you want .
0	and can re - do course as you want .
0	i had reservations_about doing an online course because of the lack of personal interaction , but this took away all reservations .
0	would highly_recommend it .
0	ordered my shampoo and conditioner on the sunday and has arrived today .
0	great prices !
0	even got a 00_%_discount !!
0	will_defo be buying more from here !
0	!
0	natalie
0	bathroom to you are great value for money , the delivery service is very quick and the telephone service is great .
0	we have been using them for about 0_months now and have never been let_down once .
0	thanks :)
0	i '_m super excited to receive my product .
0	i will order from them again .
0	love the free perks too !
0	hostelbookers is super quick and easy to use , if you ' re in a rush to book somewhere to stay then this is the place to go !
0	there i was , worrying_about finding a hostel for our stay in bangkok , worrying_about trundling through all of the hostels , images and reviews , but then i found hostelbookers !
0	it actually couldn_'_t be easier to find somewhere that you want to stay : for the right price , the right rating and the right length of time !
0	i found the hostel which suited me best , registered and two minutes later i had booked 0 nights in what looks like an amazing hostel .
0	simple , quick , and pain - free .
0	try it !
0	you '_d be crazy not to .
0	definitely .
0	i spoke to a few companies re life and critical illness and brantwood_finance was by far the best .
0	after going on their website for a quote ( the only company which offers this facility ) i got a phone_call which was great as everything was explained to me so i knew_exactly_what my options where and got a policy which best suited my budget and circumstances .
0	brantwood finace were professional and friendly at all times , always calling back when they said they would .
0	i will definitely be calling them again when my mortgage is up for review and would recommend their service to everyone .
0	thank_you brantwood_finance .
0	order arrived 0 hours late after sitting in through the estimated delivery time_slot .
0	when i got the order , the white folder i ordered was very dirty and the 0 packs of rexel mylar dividers i ordered ( at over_£ 0 a pack ) were a cheap and flimsy imitation .
0	annoying as this order ( and the delivery costs ) were not cheap .
0	won_'_t be using again .
0	i have used play - sc . com on more than one occasion now .
0	not only to they provide outstanding value but the ability to download the games purchased straight_away through the usual and official means is invaluable .
0	no having to wait for a delivery , no items damaged in the post .
0	play - sc has never let_me down yet with regards to security or reliability .
0	i will_continue to use you service unfazed .
0	mazuma_mobile have hit the nail on the head with their mobile recylcing service .
0	the website was easy to use , the printable mailing pack was easy to follow , print out and use .
0	i mailed it on monday_morning and the money was in the account the following_day .
0	all in all a brilliant service !
0	the file you receive at the beginning of the course was easy to follow .
0	the tutor i had was extremely_helpful and offered help whenever i required it .
0	i would recommend the course and the company to anyone who asked .
0	they are very friendly .
0	not paying reservation fees is the best part about hostel_bookers .
0	it also has a good range of hostels , and i never had any_problems with the reservations .
0	i would recommend it to anyone .
0	i thought i would give this company a chance based on the mixed_reviews , but beware - i had an extremely bad_experience .
0	i waited two week for my item to arrive .
0	growing impatient , i contacted the company by email .
0	a lady from the dagenham branch then informed me they had been trying to contact me from the day after i had ordered to let_me know there had been an issue with my order .
0	( i have no record of this but was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt .)
0	apparently , they had an ' issue with their internet ' meaning that some items they were advertising online had already been sold .
0	when i enquired_about a similar item available on their site , i was informed that this one had also already been sold .
0	i thought this was very unprofessional .
0	surely if you have a problem with your site you should make customers aware that items are not available !
0	to me , this borders on the fraudulent .
0	worst of all , although the lady started out seeming very accommodating , offering either a refund or replacement , this soon changed .
0	once i decided that a whole extra week was too long to wait for them to get a replacement and that i wanted a refund , she stopped_replying and no refund was issued .
0	i have had to put in a claim to paypal , and since there was no response escalate it to a dispute .
0	i am still_waiting on my refund , and am more confident paypal will sort it out than this inefficient company .
0	all in all i would advise anyone to think very carefully before ordering from this company - the prices seem appealing but they are not worth the potential hassle .
0	accommodation
0	absolutely_shocking .
0	we emaield to confirm that we would be getting twin_rooms to which whoever she emailed confirmed this .
0	turns_out the hotel does not provide twin_rooms , only doubles .
0	standard of room very poor .
0	strip_show
0	dance lesson was late so we were late getting to strip_show , was not offered drink on arrival ( had to go to bar and ask ) missed all food and no photos after , ( strippers stayed for about 00_minutes afterwards ) and we were ushered out by doormen .
0	show was ok .
0	club venue
0	cant_fault tiger_tiger , brilliant place .
0	dance lessons
0	dance lessons were good fun , but instructor turned_up an_hour and a quarter late , we got to venue and it was as though no one knew who we were , asked if one of us was taking the class .
0	then we had to do all chasing with chillisauce , instructor and twist and pout .
0	knocked whole day back and made a horrible rush for getting ready for night .
0	dance filmed on instructors phone , and i have not received a copy of this yet .
0	city
0	had no guidance as to where to go first night and ended_up in really rough part of newcastle .
0	dance instructor said we should have been given better advice by chillisauce as we hated first nights bars and went home early .
0	i have absolutely no idea what we have paid all that money for .
0	they organised us extremely badly and then left us to it .
0	i woud never ever recommend anyone use that company again .
0	sage 00
0	very good distance_learning courses - study sage on your_own or with the help support online - has always been someone ready to help .
0	good value for money .
0	very good courses for busy people .
0	i really enjoyed this course i would recommend everyone !!
0	!
0	karolina kolaszt
0	having worked with atom00 i have no_hesitation in recommending them .
0	a superb team with a vast_amount of online expertise .
0	product arrived quickly and exactly as i had hoped
0	what a great product !
0	the handi rack stores so easily in my car .
0	it doesn_'_t take up much space in the boot and now i can get_rid of the chunky roof_bars that took up much needed garage space .
0	i forgot to get travel_insurance and only remembered whilst in the cab to the airport .
0	the process was so simple i got a quote and booked my insurance on my mobile before i took off !
0	returned to a cuddly meerkat !
0	using the website was incredibly easy .
0	i just put in where i wanted to go and the dates i wanted and it came up with a list of hostels !
0	simply press the ' check prices ' button and it comes up with how much it will cost per_person per night in my local currency .
0	i didn_'_t even have to work out how much each person has to pay .
0	the deposit was a tiny amount , so if we have to cancel its not big deal .
0	it also let_me know how much was left payable to the hostel on arrival in their local currency .
0	a very smooth and easy process and it took about five_minutes .
0	definitely a great and easy to use website .
0	such a fantastic idea - simple to use .
0	when moving home we had no idea where to go for removals .
0	but compare my move made it easy to find reliable movers .
0	i found compare my move on twitter and the form on the website is easy to complete .
0	we had two companies call us in 00_hours .
0	lovely flowers arrived next_day and were wrapped beautifully , my mum was very happy
0	terrible service , flowers were nothing like the one '_s advertised .
0	i was embarrassed that my mum received such a terrible item for her 00th_birthday .
0	0000000 - i have been on and off the phone all day with customer_services , they have now said that they have to let '_s aside for me and think its ' positive ' i will get these in time .
0	what i want to know is , do you definitely have my tickets ?
0	when will they be sent ?
0	will they be send by courier ?
0	i don_'_t want to have to pick them up from a pick_up point at the event in case anything_goes_wrong .
0	i love cooking and eating healthily but have always faltered on snacks .
0	i ordered a graze box as it was free to see what it was like .
0	i am dairy_free and the website allowed me to go through and ' bin ' all the dairy snacks , which is great .
0	four little snack punnets came in the graze box , all the perfect size for snacking either at home , out and about or at work .
0	people have mentioned the calories are high ..... yes they are , nuts and dried_fruits are high in calories ( just because it '_s healthy doesn_'_t mean there '_s no calorific content ), but so is a mars bar .
0	which is better for you ?
0	people also mention the portions are too small , but any bigger portion of nuts or dried fried would send the calorie content rocketing .
0	not having the option to dip into the packet again is fantastic for people with little will power !
0	i drink a fruit , veg , seed and spirulina smoothie early every morning , and one little punnet around 00 . 00am tides me over until lunchtime .
0	i have to say , i think the people who own this company have hit the nail on the head with the website , it '_s great to have the opportunity to have an input on the snacks ( bin , like , love , send soon ).
0	at £ 0 . 00 a box i think it '_s also good value .... averages out at 00p_each per punnet .
0	i am so happy with graze that i now have one nibblebox and one lightbox delivered each week .
0	we don_'_t usually shop in primark , and tend to favour slightly more_expensive high_street brands .
0	but was advised by a couple of friends to go and have a look in this one .
0	we went to this primark one evening ( 0th_june ) about an_hour before it shut and ended_up spending about £_000 .
0	although they were close to doors closing , the staff_member on the changing rooms upstairs couldn_'_t do enough to help both of us .
0	the clothes i bought were better quality than i expected and at really low_prices .
0	we went for a meal afterwards and spent about 00_minutes talking_about the exceptional customer service we received from the two girls on the tills downstairs ( we paid separately but put stuff in the same bag ).
0	they made an effort to make conversation with us , not just about the products but about things generally .
0	they were happy , smiling , and we came away completely_satisfied .
0	my partner , who is the store manager of a vey well_known_brand said he would happily employ either of them if they behaved like that in an interview .
0	i wish we had found out their names , but didn_'_t really think that far ahead at the time .
0	well_done primark !
0	i order make up from the boots website every 0 / 0_months , and either get it delivered to my apartment or to collect in store ( depending how much i '_ve spent ).
0	delivery always_arrives to either destination within the desired time and products are always packaged well .
0	the only_negative part of this process is having to part with my cash !
0	website easy to navigate , checkout_process simple .
0	got an_email to say my parcel was on its way , and it arrived well within the given time .
0	very happy with the products .
0	will definitely order merchandise from here again .
0	i have received 0 or 0 parcels via yodel and they have never let_me down .
0	polite , happy delivery drivers , who don_'_t mind climbing up the stairs to get to our apartment .
0	the tracker service is always up to date and i always know when i can expect my parcel .
0	can '_t_believe all the negative_reviews !
0	i must be very lucky .
0	ordered from here many_times , as well as having to return / exchange items and have never been unhappy with the service .
0	they have recently changed couriers ( to yodel i think ) and the delivery is super quick .
0	i have received refunds in the time stated , and exchanges quickly .
0	the sizes on items vary , so it '_s a guessing game sometimes , but they are all of good quality .
0	office 000 offers a great service .
0	their prices are very good , the products are of excellent quality and they deliver on time .
0	what more could you want ?
0	after looking for a cold sterilising system , which aren_'_t easily found anymore , i found this site was the cheapest by far , delivery was extremely fast and arrived the next_day .
0	postage prices were fantastic and overall service was second to none !
0	i '_m very happy because i ordered this pillow .
0	i love it and now i sleeping very well !
0	excellent service and great value for money
0	i '_ve been using monkey products for just over 0_months now and i '_m very impressed with the quality and range available .
0	after years of using other more_expensive brands and being disappointed with the results or taste and texture of their protein_shakes i '_m_glad i '_ve finally found a protein_powder that mixes so well and tastes good too .
0	i use primal 00 at the moment but when i '_ve finished will be trying the x - blend after_reading the info .
0	i also use monkeys fish_oils , cla , super d0 , pri multi and creatine and am very happy with all of them !
0	a quick mention to the team at monkey , very helpful , deliveries are quick and well_packaged and the website is packed full of info and easy to use and order from .
0	keep_up the good work monkey !
0	really pleased with my order and delivery was very fast .
0	best price i could find and i knew i was ordering from a reputable_company .
0	ordered a washing_machine online on wednesday_evening for delivery on saturday .
0	they called thursday to confirm all my details - very friendly operator .
0	he informed me i would be contacted the evening before my delivery date to confirm what 0 hour delivery slot i could expect .
0	i received an_automated call at about 0pm letting_me know my appliance would be delivered between_0am and 0pm .
0	i then got a call at 0 . 00am to let_me know they would be with me between 0 . 00am and 00 . 00am .
0	i paid £_00 for connection which the two very friendly delivery drivers completed within half an_hour .
0	very reasonable .
0	excellent delivery service and communication_throughout and also one of the cheapest retailers of our chosen product so thumbs_up all_round !
0	00_hours after i ordered an unlock_code for a blackberry_0000 ( with new security software ) i received my email , entered the code and within 00 seconds was up and running on 00 ( was on orange ).
0	great service !
0	would recommend to anyone !!
0	!
0	i ordered late on the 0th and it has yet to ship , of course payment was taken straight_away .
0	i was wary before ordering so i ordered £_00 ( 0 items / phone stuff ) so i ain '_t overly upset if it doesn_'_t come .
0	i emailed them 0_days ago , took them today to answer .
0	they sounded polite , apparently it '_s because of the holiday so there '_s too many orders ( which quite_frankly is not a good excuse when there '_s no mention on the site ).
0	i shall see what_happens from here .
0	update
0	i received my order a few_days ago and everything is as it was described on the site and came well_packaged .
0	however i '_m still annoyed from before .
0	after emailing them i was told on the 00th that it was yet to be shipped , yet a day later my account was updated saying my order was actually shipped on the 00th the day i originally emailed them .
0	whether they have delayed site updates or what i don_'_t know why but whoever i emailed should have known my order was already shipped and never confirmed to me when it was shipped after i asked them to .
0	the site itself is not bad , they need better customer service and to stop lying to customers about 00hour shipping that doesn_'_t exist .
0	it '_s an alright shop but isn_'_t anything special .
0	the clothes in my opinion can be a hit or miss and some items intended to look expensive are just tacky but have an extra £_00 added on .
0	they have some nice stuff because i '_ve bought a jumper there that looked lovely and also a pair of shorts aswell as basics but even these i could buy cheaper elsewhere at the same quality .
0	i attempted shopping online with them once last_year but the accidentally ( just bad_luck ) canceled my order but left it a long time before telling_me so half of the stuff i wanted was sold out .
0	customer service was okay however they agreed to give me a money off code because of the issue yet i never received this until i had to email them once again asking for it .
0	i haven_'_t actually used it yet ( and i assume it will have expired by now ) but it was only 0 %_off anyway and i haven_'_t seen anything online that i '_ve wanted to buy from them since .
0	i will shop at there stores from time to time but it just isn_'_t really my favorite shop .
0	amazing ! really quick , quality packed , delivered too !
0	already enjoying my tan :) thank_you guys !
0	the best price i could find after surfing a lot in the internet as i knew already what i am looking for ; plus the delivery was super_fast :) made my day !
0	thanks again ,)
0	i have sold you 0 phones in the past year , the last 0 being a friends .
0	this time i thought i would get quotes from other phone_recycling websites but you not only came up with the best deal but you are the only phone_recycling site that will pay you even if the phone is not working which myfriends phone was not .
0	thanks again and i will only ever use your site for phone_recycling .
0	also now you have added a bac payments system the payments are alot_quicker it doesn_'_t take more than 0 working_days to go through the whole_process of selling a phone to you .
0	i recommend mazuma to any body who has a phone which the no_longer need or no_longer works , if they don_'_t have internet access then i offer to do it for them .
0	really simple site to use .
0	plus points are that they have individual photos of the room your booking so you get a better idea of what to expect .
0	reviews are helpful but woul take them with a pinch of salt .
0	always a good place to check when your planning a budget holiday
0	i '_d definitely recommend , the package we got was perfectly organised .
0	all elements were of a high_standard , everywhere was expecting us , so there were no_problems .
0	staff at chillisauce always very helpful .
0	very pleased with the service .
0	fast .
0	easy will definitely use again
0	i visited litecraft oldham on 00nd october with the intention of buying a ceiling_light .
0	after browsing the store for 0 minutes i was approached by a young_lady_who offered me chocolates and a coffee .
0	i was extremly impressed with the service and her knowledge of their products and was helped quickly to find a suitable light .
0	i also found two table_lamps that i was interested in but these where out of stock .
0	however i was told these could be ordered for me and sent to my house within 0_days .
0	my lights where delivered 0_days_later .
0	i can_honestly_say i had no_problems with my experience at litecraft and have written to the company aknowledging there superb service and i will definitly be shopping here again in the future .
0	did not inform_me that the product i had ordered was out of stock and that my order would not arrive until much later .
0	on their website it said my product was in stock !
0	kept my money for ten days , and it was not until i called customer_services that they agreed to refund me .
0	rude response on the phone .
0	would not recommend just_miniatures to anybody .
0	easy to order , fast delivery and good product .
0	have used the runners under my dining_table to protect the carpet and they work a treat .
0	would definately buy from this company again .
0	used e_- outdoor for the first time and found their service to be excellent .
0	the items arrived the day after i ordered them and the price was the best i had found on the net .
0	would definately recommend .
0	flashbay have a wide_range of products to choose from which allowed_us to select what we really needed , as well as modify it to our wishes .
0	the staff gave_us an excellent service and the delivery was very quick .
0	ms elorna laudat was our contact person and she was always very helpful and answered our queries immediately .
0	i would definitely suggest flashbay , especially for those teams organizing conferences .
0	after i have read all previuos reviews about this company , i was shocked a bit . how people can be sure it is good , just because it is cheap and " site is easy to use "... absurd .
0	i had two claims on my policy since i ordered this insurance .
0	in both_cases i faced an unprofessional , very slow , complicated team work .
0	i have been waiting for an engineer to come about 0_weeks .
0	then i been left with broken washing_machine for 0 more days , just because they were unable to get parts .
0	disapointed and very angry i ordered a parts by myselfe at indesit online shop and fixed lifters in minutes .
0	then i tried to explain to warranty shop group , i don_'_t need their help anymore , because all is fixed by customer .
0	i never received a refund for the work they failed to do .
0	remember , you always get what you pay for , and surprisingly_low price doesn_'_t mean good service in this case .
0	i have cancelled this policy and going back to more_expensive , but reliable company .
0	it is 00 orders been placed with nature '_s best , since i found their shop online .
0	great quality products , which really works and helps , quick shipping - what a happy customer may need more ?!
0	well_done , nature '_s best !
0	i ordered my tyres online .
0	took my car in on the morning and was all done in half hour .
0	staff were friendly and helpful .
0	please do not make the mistake that i made ! i would not advise anyone to switch to this provider .
0	my energy bill doubled in four_weeks !
0	believe me this is no exaggeration . the amount i have been billed in these four_weeks is a over a fifth of what i was quoted by first_utility in the estimate for the whole year and with my family is already very energy conscious .
0	do the maths , does that sound like a good deal to you ?
0	i actually feel_stupid for listening to these people i am counting_down the days to switch back to my previous_supplier .
0	if you want to pay money to a company that is impossible to communicate with these jokers would be perfect .
0	if you manage to get through to an operator in the first place i '_d be amazed and if they were of any use to you when you did i '_d be doubly amazed .
0	send them an_email .
0	they won_'_t respond .
0	ring them and they cut you off .
0	ring them again and tell them they '_ve cut you off , they promise that they '_ll ring you back .
0	they won_'_t ring you back .
0	ring them and tell them they didn_'_t ring you back .
0	there '_s no one to speak to you .
0	i wondered_why i '_d never_heard of this company when it sounded so good .
0	i wish i never had .
0	i ordered a pair of beaver velocity fins and received them a week after i made the order which was fine , until i realised they had sent me one fin of one size and the other fin of a completely_different size .
0	when i rang up to ask what had happened they said it was beavers mistake and if i sent them back they would send me out a new pair .
0	i called them to make_sure they had received the fins i returned and they said they would have the new fins back to me in a week .
0	a week and a half went by and no word so i called them again and they said they just got in a shipment so i would have them in 0_days .
0	0_days went by and nothing so i called once again and they again said that a shipment had just come in but i desperately_needed them by the weekend as i was going on holiday and had been waiting 0_weeks for them .
0	they ensured me that they would be sending them out the next_day and would post them next_day delivery so i would get them on friday .
0	i called on thursday to make_sure they had sent them out and this is when they finally decide to tell me that they ' re out of stock .
0	i '_m_sure the product would have been fine but the terrible service diverswarehouse has provided by keeping_me completely out of the loop concerning my order has convinced me to never buy from this company again despite using the company before .
0	i encourage you to do the same and take your custom elsewhere .
0	i have used envirofone every time i have needed to sell my old_handsets .
0	the process is very easy and quick and i find they always offer competitive_prices .
0	would be happy to recommend and use again and again
0	having_laser really has_been life_changing .
0	its the small things you notice which really make you smile , like seeing the leaves on the trees in absolute clarity , it '_s just wonderful !
0	i ordered t in the park tickets and was nervous_about getting them in_advance of the festival but they arrived within 0_days of ordering - i got a text_message to confirm they were on their way and they were cheaper_than any other site i could find , including the official site which was sold out !
0	brilliant - i would use double0 again .
0	amy duke
0	have only just recently started shopping through tesco . com they are very quick to resolve any_problems and the quality of goods and the friendly drivers is so much_better_than other home delivery of other supermarkets
0	extremely unhappy with service recieved when moving home spent at_least 0 hours on the telephone trying to sort_out a problem that was caused by them .
0	once contract is up i will be moving to another_supplier
0	extremely unsatisfied with the customer_services i recieved when the toilet basin they supplied was faulty still_waiting for replacement after reporting fault 0_weeks_ago will not be using again .
0	no communication from them even_though several emails were sent .
0	i purchased a stroller from another retailer ( online_retailer ) that turned_out to be faulty and collapsed with my daughter in it and they were reluctant to refund me , they then sent me another of the same stroller .
0	this one did exactly the same .
0	i work in retail and if something is faulty and its partly due to design fault they should have a product re - call however they did not want to do that !
0	they also said if they didnt think it was that faulty id have to pay and i had to pay for them to collect and replace !
0	after a number of very upsett emails and rude replies i am now waiting to recieve my refund !
0	unfortunately due to their actions i was reluctant to buy again online however i work and im unable to get around to look for a new stroller .
0	therefore i gave ' pramworld ' a chance and im_glad i did !
0	i ordered on the friday and right away recieved emails_telling_me when to expect my new stroller .
0	emails very different from the other retailer , very polite and helpful as i did not understand the first email it was explained and i didnt feel as though they thought i was daft !
0	pushchair is due today between the hours of 0pm and 0pm ( very specific and helps as i can go out and do without sitting in like a wolly !)
0	and hopefully ill have better look with this stroller otherwise i give up !
0	my daughter is now very weary of a buggy as the last two collapsed with her in them !
0	so i need something sturdy !
0	hopefully this is it !
0	thankyou again great service kept_informed all though the process !!
0	!
0	over all very good fast strait to the door no_messing_about thanks jo
0	it was really easy to do , the freepost_bag turned_up very fast , posted it and received emails_keeping_me up to date then my money came through v fast !

0	the iow festival was amazing and im so glad we got to go !
0	!
0	understandably we were nervous_about buying tickets through viagogo as we had never used them before but we will definitely but using it again .
0	printing . com always provide competitive quotes paired with outstanding service .
0	mazuma has a very simple , easy to use website that makes it great for trading in your old phone .
0	the delivery bag and money / vouchers are sent out really quickly and you get an_email_confirming each_step of the way so you know_whats_going on with your phone .
0	for all the phones we have traded in so far mazuma have offered the highest price compared to the other recycling websites and we also really like the option of recieving the money in argos_vouchers - you also get a bit extra if you opt for vouchers_instead of cash .
0	overall they offer a very very effective fast service without_any complaints !
0	alpharooms its a great website ive used it goin on my last 0 holidays and will be using it on any future holidays .
0	great prices and good honest revies allow you to choose the best accomodation for you .
0	really easy to use website , good lay_out , clear photos of sweets and hampers etc .
0	massive_selection of sweets available , may have to pop down the co - op to satisfy my sweet craving until my order arrives !
0	definitely be using them the next time i upgrade !
0	!
0	i have ordered wheels and made mistake , after confirming the return will cost £_00 i have been charged_£_000 for not accepted goods .
0	now they wont communicate at all .
0	i have bought bed which creaks .
0	they don_'_t care about my disrupted sleep and discomfort after 0_months of trying to get somewhere they now no_longer reply .
0	if you thinking of buying from them then think again as the quality of their furniture is poor .
0	i have been battling over bed i have purchased from them over 0_months now , their bed creaks at every move so i have been facing disrupted sleep over this whole time and they don_'_t care .
0	i had to go trough so many hoops with a complain and after 0 visits to the shop i was told i have to send an_email , not even a phone number to raise my complain .
0	after a lot more time and a lot more emails eventually someone came to see the bed , established that the creaking comes from the frame all over the place and had been explained 0 broken slut which is not causing any creaking has_been broken by walking on the bed trying to stop the creaking noises i receive an_email that the creaking is due to the damage i have caused !!
0	this company is disgraceful and does not value their customers .
0	please stay away from this company as you only in for a disappointment .
0	this site has many great products which many of them i continue to use year after year .
0	given plenty of chances to this company , but it just fails us every time and caused us loss of business
0	we are very happy that we found a reliable supplier which can deliver when we need .
0	great range of products at competitive_prices .
0	delivery is reliable and always_arrives within 0_days but usually next_day .
0	what is really great is the text reminder and re - order service - very efficient .
0	wouldn_'_t buy my dog_food anywhere_else now .
0	i was having a nightmare with an order .
0	sarah dealt_with my issue in an extremely fast and efficient way - thank_you !
0	ordered a dog_harness and didn_'_t expect it to arrive for a few_days as i chose free delivery .
0	it arrived much more quickly than i expected less_than a week_later , which was great as it arrived the same day as my dog so was able to take him out in the car straight_away .
0	easy ordering and efficient service will definitely use the site again .
0	bought a htc phone after_seeing unlocked mobiles on the htc website .
0	delivered as advertised .
0	was provided a tracking_number upon dispatch .
0	i have already_recommended them to friends .
0	very happy with my dealings with oakfurnitureland .
0	i placed my order 0_weeks_ago for some solid_oak bedroom_furniture .
0	i must_admit i was a bit_worried_about ordering nearly_£ 0000 worth of furniture on line without_seeing it first .
0	my mind was put at rest when i visited the website as it has many videos of the products and clearly has stores in certain parts of the uk , however not close enough to me to visit , not to worry , i knew by ordering with my credit_card i would be covered in the event of a problem .
0	i needent have worried , furniture arrived on time as arranged , great communicaton , and i was over the moon with the quality .
0	it has that lovely brand_new smell , and there was no assembly other than a couple of bolts for the top and bottom of the robe .
0	the drivers and the assistant could not have been kinder , and were very profesional .
0	this company is clearly going places .
0	debs
0	supplement_warehouse and everything i need for my fitness needs in one simple website .
0	their selection is unbelievable and their quickness and getting products shipped is incomparable to any other site i '_ve ordered from !
0	i had a dreadful experience with optical_express .
0	went for a consultation and was told i am suitable for ( the most expensive ) laser_eye_surgery they have .
0	agreed to do it and paid full cost in_advance .
0	on the day of the procedure , took time off work , went to the clinic only to have a chat with the surgeon who said he wanted additional confirmation from my gp and a specialist that i am suitable due to my other health_issues ( which on the consultation day i was assured would not cause a problem ).
0	very frustrated i was turned away and am now waiting for 0_months to see a specialist to confirm i can go_ahead with the procedure .
0	when i asked for my money back i was told i will have it within 0_days .
0	nobody got in touch with me after 0_days , so i rang the company and reminded them i want my money back .
0	someone took my card_details and said it will take up to 00 days to return my approx .
0	£ 0 , 000 to my account .
0	since when does it take so long to carry out an online transaction ??
0	it took me 0 minutes to send them my money in the first place .
0	after a month , no contact from optical_express and no money , i kept ringing them and they promised to call me back which they never did .
0	finally i got hold of someone from the their financial department who said there was no record of my bank details , so he took them again and told me to wait some more .
0	i don_’_t think i will hear back from them again and will have to keep ringing and ringing to get my money back for a procedure that i was told i could have and was turned away .
0	when they wanted me to become their patient they didn_’_t mysteriously lose my details and kept ringing twice a day to remind to pay etc .
0	but when it comes to paying me back after having mucked me about for so long , they go quiet .. is this a scam ?
0	?
0	i am never coming_back to this joke of a company !!
0	why waste all that money on advertising if they treat customers who are willing to pay like this ??
0	it ’_s a joke ..
0	i suggest to everyone choosing a different company to avoid_disappointment and appalling customer service .
0	i ordered a mixer from gear0music before christmas and they kept us updated of when it would arrive etc and it was dead on time .
0	i then ordered a microphone and shock mount and it was due to arrive today and it did .
0	easy and secure to pay and excellent choice of couriers .
0	uk mail were outstanding and their tracking_system_works_perfectly ,
0	i '_d definitely reccommend this company to anyone_wanting music equipment like that .
0	my fiancé and i went to marlows looking for our_wedding_bands and were helped by trish .
0	the selection was vast and trish helped_us find the perfect rings at a brilliant price and due to the large_amount amount of stock carried , they were there for us to take away on that day .
0	we are very pleased with the service we received and our beautiful wedding_rings .
0	we would happily_recommend to anyone .
0	i had to send back a bathroom_cabinet back to the retailer urgently in order to comply with the 0 day distance_selling regulations for unwanted_items .
0	the booking process was nice and simple however after i got the confirmation and printed_off all the paperwork ready for it to be collected , i got an_email the next_day stating that the collection had been cancelled as they had " problems delivering to the post_code before ".
0	this was unexpected - i would expect a parcel company to be able to deliver to any postcode !
0	i was not impressed .
0	so i booked with [_external_reference_] instead - 0_stars for them , 0_stars for you !
0	!
0	gr0 deals .

0	i placed an order with pet_planet and now i am unable to access website says web_page is taking to long to respond .
0	this is not a problem with my internet as have no problem with anything_else . so now am unsure if order was accepted or dispatched or even how long its going to take to come . as i can access webpage i cant even get contact details .
0	alfie and mictchel helped use move from our 0 bed to 0 bed house and could not do enough to help ... nothing was too much_trouble .
0	they made an already stressful day a bit less_stressful !
0	can '_t complain .
0	good all_round service .
0	out of the several other booking sights i attempted to navigate , hostelbookers are by far the best .
0	they made it very straight_forward and easy to access hostel information and the layout of the site was very user_friendly .... even if your a weary computer user like myself !
0	the confirmation_email was quick in response with detailed directions attached to my chosen destination , would definitely recommend !
0	we climed kilimanjaro for our_honeymoon and it was the most amazing experience and private_kilimanjaro helped to make it special for us .
0	from booking right through to getting home after the climb the staff were fantastic .
0	the office staff helped_us before we went by dealing_with our booking in an effiencient way and giving us tips and advice aswell as answering any_questions we had about the climb or kit that we would need .
0	whilst in tanzania the private_kilimanjaro staff were amazing , they met us at the airport and took us to our hotel where we were briefed then picked_up from the following_day .
0	whilst on the mountain our lead guides were fab , helping_us in any way they could and tailoring the climb to our needs and abilities - and helping_us when feeling the effects of altitude sickness .
0	they were friendly and chatted to us like friends throughout the climb .
0	the food was excellent - and far better_than anything we could have expected to be cooked on a mountain .
0	we were very well fed with 0 hot meals a day and snacks too aswell as fresh boiled water everyday to help with our climb .
0	the equipment that we were provided with was excellent .
0	we managed to make it to the summit , the last few hours were hard as we had mild altitude sickness but our guides helped_us deal with it in a way which_meant we could still reach the top .
0	all in all it was a fantastic trip and i would not_hesitate to use private_kilimanjaro again for a future adventure .
0	i absolutely love this product , it is timeless and feels classy and elegant .
0	it has swarovski_crystals and they look amazing in the sun .
0	i researched the price and watches first was the cheapest one i found , i expected something to be compromise with the price being so cheap but i was very impressed with the personal_touch from watches 0st .
0	i had ordered 0 of the same product , one for me and one as a gift , and i received a call from a very pleasant man who gently enquired if i '_d had problems ordering online as he wanted to make me aware that i '_d ordered 0 .
0	excellent service - not many companies would have checked .
0	in fact it wasn_'_t a mistake ordering 0 , but it could well have been and i was very grateful of the phonecall to make_sure .
0	my order was despatched_immediately and reached me the following working day .
0	i am often the moaning customer that gets irritated with bad service , expects reasonable service , so i thought it only fair to review this excellent service too - well_done and thank_you to watches 0st - thumbs_up !!
0	:)
0	i '_ve_used interparcel on many occasions and wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend .
0	their rates are as low as you can get , but the service is second to none .
0	i usually use ups for my uk deliveries as i '_ve never had a late parcel and the driver is super friendly !
0	if you are looking to send a parcel then you won_'_t find a better company than interparcel !
0	tutor is great , fantastic course , modules are well set out and the directive is easily_understood .
0	couldnt be_happier with the course or the tutor support :) looking into doing another course with ncc_home_learning .
0	we booked to stay at a lovely hotel in paris back in march_0000 for our_honeymoon .
0	our booking was processed quickly and we were really pleased to have somewhere lovely to stay for such a reasonable_price .
0	after_realising there was no check in or out time given on our booking , i called to confirm with their call_center abroad .
0	after a quick call , and receiving the info i needed , i was therefore shocked to receive an e_- mail_stating that our booking was cancelled .
0	the adviser that we had spoken to had cancelled our booking even_though there was no request to do so .
0	the money had been removed from our account
0	as a result , the next week or so was spent desperately_trying to resolve the problem .
0	their resolution involved rebooking the hotel room and paying again whilst i waited for my refund .
0	unfortunately i wasn_'_t made of money and couldn_'_t afford to do that .
0	it was then a waiting game to see whether we could rebook the rooms for the same price once the refund came through .
0	the problem was compounded_by the fact that everything else had been subsequently been booked !
0	i was promised numerous_calls back from the team at hotels . com but never received them .
0	to say the experience was stressful was an_understatement and was not how we anticipated the beginning of honeymoon to be .
0	i '_d not recommend this company to anyone and certainly won_'_t be using them in future .
0	i first visited the freedom clinic in leeds in 0000 after suffering from terrible sciatica and neck problems .
0	after an initial assessment , i began treatment also immediately and was given a structured treatment plan .
0	i can_honestly_say that after the first treatment , my pain significantly improved .
0	i also realised that the pain and stiffness that i '_d been putting up with for years that had been unnecessary .
0	not only do i now very rarely have issues with my back and my neck , but when it does flair up , i '_ve been given exercises to help combat this .
0	i still see my chiropractor rachael , every 0_weeks , but this is to ensure everything is still stable .
0	i cannot recommend the team at freedom highly_enough & have referred many friends and family_members .

0	the memory came very quickly in safe safe packaging to protect the memory , and their find my computer helped_me identify what memory i would need .
0	overall very very happy .
0	super helpful customer service will definitely use again thanks for your help !
0	lured in by bargain prices and promises of next_day delivery .
0	the details of my farcical transaction with camerabox are boundless .
0	they took money from my account after they cancelled my order .
0	their packages are impossible to trace .
0	their couriers do not leave a note if you are not in .
0	they delibaretly kept me misinformed .
0	their customer_services helpline is simpley another money eating machine , used to stall and sidetrack customers , manned by incredibley rude " representatives ".
0	they do not care about their customers .
0	they want them to be confused so that they can take_advantage of the situation .
0	they used a different courier service to the one stated on their webpage ( they do not directly inform you of the courier service you are paying for , nor a tracking_number ) and gave them an incorrect_address .
0	this was for a redelivery .
0	i have been putting up with this nonsense for weeks , i still do not have the camera i ordered and have paid for in full .
0	i do not know if it will be in working condition if i ever do receive it , and they may never refund their customers as i have learnt from this site .
0	they are under suspicion of fraud .
0	they already have my bank details , do not give them yours .
0	in reference to a post titled " no refund given since before christmas ":
0	i also asked for the managers name which was ***."
0	i have been emailing "***" and when i spoke with "***" today and asked him where their company was based ( oxfordshire apparently ) he criticized me for asking irrelevant questions .
0	i '_m giving them till friday , then i would be quite happy to unite with and any other dissatisfied_customers to help you and the rest of us get our money back .

0	the fees are , at times , a bit high , but it '_s cheaper , quicker and more secure than any other bank .
0	i really cannot recommend this site enough .
0	i was superbly pleased to receive my item the day after i ordered it , despite selecting free shipping .
0	also , they always have the new_releases ready to pre_- order before anyone_else ( or so it seems ) and they have a great selection in stock .
0	so chuffed !
0	trouble free and painless , what more can i say
0	we were very impressed with the speedy and professional service .
0	the range of products is impressive and details are very clear .
0	will defiantly be visiting the site again .
0	i '_ve been looking for gruffalo trunki under the £_00 pricemark for ages and this was cheaper_than most other_retailers ' prices for the regular designs .
0	very pleased .
0	really easy to get in touch if there are any_queries .
0	the garage was courteous when it called to say my car had failed ( on something i was expecting ) and gave_me a clear and concise breakdown of costs , incl vat and labour , before_proceeding .
0	collected my car from work as soon as i arrived and had it back to me by the time i requested .
0	really happy .
0	it '_s great to be able to get quality chocolate on the high_street that hasn_'_t been pumped_full of vegetable fat to improve the texture ( google it if you don_'_t know who i '_m talking_about ).
0	the customer service at the stores is always excellent and often they have samples for you to try when you visit .
0	i '_ve never bought anything from hotel_chocolat that i haven_'_t enjoyed thoroughly and it '_s well_worth the price .
0	i have nothing good to say about vistaprint .
0	even disregarding their scandal with signing customers up to a £ 0 -£_00 a month subscription service without their consent ( conveniently hiding the opt out box very well ) their product quality are shipping times are appalling .
0	can '_t fault their customer service though .
0	fantastic company and site .
0	others have tried to copy the idea after justeat '_s success and failed completely .
0	makes ordering the occasional takeaway very convenient .
0	i just wish more local companies would sign up !
0	last time i used the tesco entertainment it was really bad - unclear and usually down from too much traffic .
0	their new entertainment site is so much_better and while tries too hard to look sleek and modern the actual reliability and functionality is greatly_improved .
0	tesco prices are always fantastic too .
0	my mother lives a few_hundred_miles_away so iflorist '_s delivery service seemed like a great idea - a combo of flowers , chocolates and cards with guaranteed delivery by mothers_day .
0	i received my order confirmation with a delivery date of saturday ... saturday rolled around with no phonecall from my mum .
0	fair_enough i thought , they '_ll get there tomorrow .
0	called my mum yesterday and she was disappointed that she hadn_'_t received anything , and i felt like a terrible daughter .
0	i have since contacted_iflorist via_email , through their support centre , twitter and facebook .
0	they have ignored every message i have sent , and have even gone so far as deleting my a facebook message i posted requesting a response .
0	absolutely terrible company that i will not be going anywhere_near again .
0	i expect a refund immediately , and an_apology , though with the level of customer service i '_ve seen here i imagine i '_ll be fighting for it .
0	oh , and if you want a laugh , have a look at all the photos of dead flowers people have received on twitter - it '_s hilarious !
0	maybe it '_s a blessing in disguise that nothing was delivered .
0	i had 0 parcels under the ' prime ' service with amazon and for some reason this week they are all coming via hdnl .
0	they were due to be delivered on monday and according to the amazon website ( which i can only_assume comes from information that hdnl supply them ) my parcels were delivered at 0000 00 dec !
0	however on checking the hdnl website they went out for delivery on 00 dec was then returned and went back out again on the 00 dec and no more information after that .
0	i contacted amazon who said that looking through the records that it says there was no access to the property !
0	i am on a military base that has 00hr manning at the main guard room , this company has delivered ( slowly ) to the address in the past ( unfortunately the ou use them too ) and they are aware they should arrive before 0pm for the main post room and carry identification just like all the other delivery companies that have no_problems with delivering packages .
0	i even called them once to hold a package so that i could collect it myself which they assured me they had put aside when i got to the depot ( it ’_s a 00 minute drive_away ) the parcel was nowhere to be seen and so they called the driver who said he had just delivered it to me and updated there system saying it was signed for by me which was a lie as i was stood in the depot !
0	the website was easy to use and the price offered was good didnt have to worry_about charger or original packaging .
0	amazing company , ordered a orbit g0 system got 0 - 0 week wait in delivery and it came within 0 week !
0	the staff are also so helpful !
0	i love amazon , it just perfect for shopping
0	“ hi guys ,
0	i '_d just like to say my furniture arrived safe and sound today and i love it !
0	thanks for a speedy service , and you never know , i might be back in touch for a kitchen table and chairs in a couple of months !
0	kind_regards
0	sandy ”
0	i wished to cancel and re - book my order with a different courier .
0	richard_mileham helped_me on the facebook chat page and was very helpful .
0	he did all the work for me and made it very easy .
0	thanks a lot richard !
0	excellent customer_services .
0	i went into sunglass_hut in town and tried on some sunglasses , turns_out the ones i loved were a pair of chanel avaitors costing_£_000 .
0	i decided to go home and search the internet for a better price .
0	i found a trusted company who sold them for £_000 and decided to order them , however they were out of stock and would take 0_weeks for delivery , so i contiuned my search , i came_across sunglasses_shop who were selling them for £_000 but i noticed the did a price match service .
0	i called them and spoke to chloe in customer_services who asked me to send details and they would confirm if they were able to match the price .
0	i called them back and they confirmed they could do them at the same price as the other company at £_000 with free delievery .
0	chloe checked the stock for me and said there was only one pair left ... determined to get this pair i asked her to put the order through asap after a few emails the order was in and payment was made .
0	this was on monday_afternoon and i was advised i would receive them on wednesday .
0	to my supprise tuesday_morning ups turned_up with my glasses !
0	!
0	everything was perfect !
0	i dont normally_write_reviews but the level of customer service i recieved was outstanding and chloe was really helpfull making_sure i got these glasses !
0	the delievery was extreamly quick !
0	i cant rate this company high enough .
0	if your reading this and deciding if you should buy from them , then i hope ive helped you make your desicion !
0	thanks again chloe , i will definitely buy from sunglassesshop . co . uk again !
0	!
0	had o0 00 month_contract , no_problems but did find insurance expensive & waste of time to be honest .
0	(£ 0 . 00_pm for samsung_tocco ultra ) when phone did break i was told although it was 00 months old it would be covered for repair so didn_'_t have to go through insurance .
0	other than that , always had good signal & no other complaints
0	always have everything needed .
0	love the fact you can input receipt details on internet and check you got the best price or they '_ll refund the difference .
0	simple & cheap what more do you want ?
0	?
0	completed all required info on website .
0	sent special delivery as 0 phones worth £_000 , cost £ 0 to send but worth it .
0	sent on monday , received tuesday_morning .
0	bank_transfer tuesday_afternoon .
0	so simple , so quick !!
0	!
0	used a online discount_voucher having checked out products online prior , found the whole_process really easy and delivery was quick , now using my items and they are good quality with no_issues .
0	ive been using vegan shake products due to an intolerance to dairy .
0	after months of elimination and a cleanse it was time to try things again .
0	this is the first whey i have ordered , i decided to try the flavour of the month and i wasn_'_t disappointed , it tastes just like a bounty bar , what a treat !
0	mixes well in my shaker and tastes lovely with almond_milk .
0	small problem with the website crashing prior to payment , quick call to check and then order placed , arrived swiftly , good sturdy packaging , great prices and quality products .
0	found optimal_print online by a quick engine search for wedding thank_you cards , had lots of options and templates to chose from ( far more than many online_retailers ).
0	really simple and easy navigation tools to complete our own design .
0	when checking out we realised there was a half price offer which_meant we could_afford to upgrade to better quality paper .
0	like the fact the postcards came with good quality envelopes included in the price .
0	fast , sturdy postage .
0	great website , easy to use and understand .
0	delivery service was very poor on my recent_purchase , disappointing .
0	will be visiting vet -_medic again , professional service and very efficient delivery too .
0	i found the price after looking around unbeatable too .
0	thankyou !
0	before finding out about just eat , i was doing the usual thing of rooting around drawers to find one of the million leaflets that clutter up the house every day , then going through the rigmarole of repeating myself over the phone whilst trying to understand what the takeaway were saying down the other end .
0	but no more !
0	just eat is simple to use from the start , lists all the takeaways that deliver to your area and most_importantly , gives you a heads up about which are the best and tastiest with their star_rating_system , as voted for by our fellow hungry takeaway hunters !
0	once you '_ve found a takeaway , its a fast checkout and no worrying_about having no change or tipping the delivery driver with the pay by card option , although you can still pay the old_fashioned way if you like !
0	a super service , a tasty no_hassle way to get your takeaway .
0	just eat !
0	google can find almost every question i am looking for !
0	sometimes i have a problem trying to find some questions but overall its the best search_engine there is !
0	its perfect for finding information and images of what i want , i always use google if i need to find something :)
0	this is the first and only place where i listen to the latest music and videos , its easy to search for videos and play them and it doesn_'_t cause me any_problems what so ever i '_m impressed with this website !
0	iv never had any trouble with it :)
0	i '_m disappointed with the amount it costs to deliver something from the super drug website .
0	its cheaper for me to go and buy it direct from the store instead of forking_out for the delivery cost as well as the cost of the products .
0	i prefer to go to the store and purchase my items as its a lot_cheaper .
0	if hmv can do free delivery in the u . k then so can everyone else .
0	i love it !
0	it '_s cheap and has all the essentials needed for every_occasion and this is the first shop i shop in and actually buy loads of stuff !
0	its so cheap so my money goes a long way and im happy with my buys , its the cheapest shop to buy clothes from that i know of !
0	:)
0	hmv delivery service is brilliant and trusting plus it has free delivery in the u . k which is excellent !
0	i never have to leave my house if i want to buy entertainment again :) hmv is cheap and reliable and i always get my orders on time and they tell me all the details i need to know .
0	thank_you for a brilliant service :) x
0	i '_ll admit .
0	i did have reservations_about the service .
0	friends were full of advice ( unsolicited , and no experience of actually using mazuma ), but i decided to take a chance .
0	i applied online , got my pack through the post the next_day , i packaged my phone following the instructions and sent it off special delivery .
0	i was expecting to get emails the next_day giving me a " revised_offer " once they has my phone as a " ransom " , but nope .
0	i got an_email_saying it has_been received , another saying processing and then another , the same day saying order accepted and that my chosen method of payment ( argos_voucher ) would be with me shortly .
0	it arrived at 00am the next_morning .
0	i had no_problems using the voucher at all , and now my old phone is now a shiny_new games console for my son .
0	literally couldn_'_t be more pleased with the service from beginning to end , and have already_recommended mazuma to friends and family .
0	when i received the car from stoneacre hull it came with the log book , mot certificate ( that stoneacre had done ) and spare_key .
0	no manual or service history or proper key .
0	the car never had a description and so stoneacre ' couldnt see what the problem was ' ( their words !)
0	and that they could_possibly ' 0 finger discount ' a manual if another car like mine came in .
0	shocking .
0	also the bumper they said would be repaired ( slight dint and scuff ) before being brought to me has simply been resprayed ... dint and bumps still evident .
0	again , stoneacre couldnt see what my issue was !
0	i have been in touch with trading_standards and , stoneacre head_office and also complained to barclays ( stoneacre got me a loan through them ).
0	000_% of all my calls to stoneacre have never been returned !!!!!
0	the only time i received a call was when head_office told me to ring them as they wanted to sort the problem out ( after barclays had been in touch with them !)
0	and the guy i had to speak to was busy and then rang back .
0	when he did call back he tried to fob me off by saying he would get me another spare_key ...
0	i dont want another spare_key i already have one !
0	he then claimed to know nothing about the manual and bumper .
0	i have since been told a key has_been ordered , they have a manual for me to and will take my car in to sort the bumper out when i go to collect them .
0	this was a few_weeks_ago , i have called stoneacre many_times and no one will speak to me , one guy_who was supposed to chase_up the key order only spoke to me when i refused to give my name ( after calling 0 times !)
0	and then knew nothing , i had to tell him how to do his job by asking him to speak to the parts department !
0	he was useless and i spoke to the parts department myself ... who said there was no record of an order and to speak to the sales manager .
0	i have tried to call him 0 times today , every time i was fobbed_off and no call back .
0	since the nights have got lighter i have noticed another major problem , swirl marks alll over my car !!!!
0	a very poor polishing job , i have never seen anything like it !
0	as my car is white it is diffcult to see in low light .
0	also noticed scratches to the inside of windscreen .
0	the list just seems to be growing and i feel im getting no sort of customer service whatsoever from stoneacre .
0	i have seen that someone tried to sort this through barclays but to no_avail , may need to go to financial_ombudsman .
0	i just want it all sorting , its been nearly 0_months now !
0	i would never recommend this company to anyone , not even my worts enemy !
0	if i didnt have other things to take my mind off this horrendous situation i would just cry as its so frustrating !!!
0	!
0	i have used pet_supermarket a couple of times_now and its the cheapest place online to buy my special cat_food and with free delivery .
0	brilliant , thank_you very much
0	i was looking for a pair of teva_sandals and found them on the taunton_leisure website for just £_00 . 00 , £_00 cheaper then any where else on the internet !!
0	i ordered them , payed with paypal and they were delivered the very next_day !!
0	unbelieveable good service , i will_definately use again for buying my outdoor equipment .
0	many_thanks
0	while our rates include all shipping_costs , you may still be responsible for certain customs , tariffs , or taxes levied against your shipment .
0	viaddress . com is not responsible for any delays in shipping associated with customs difficulties .
0	for more information , we suggest contacting your local customs office . so it is very lowest_price for any service holder
0	i tracked my order at 00 . 00 with royal_mail and was informed by them that it had not yet been received by mazuma .
0	an_hour later i received an_email off mazuma informing_me that my phone had arrived and been processed .
0	a couple of hours_later i received a second email_informing_me that the money would be in my account by midnight , so as soon as i arrived home i checked my balance and sure enough my money was in .
0	it took less_than half a day from them receiving my phone to me having the money in bank .
0	absoultely incredible service .
0	i will be recomending them to anyone who will listen !
0	my first experience with this company has_been absolutely_stunning !
0	their prices are incredible & within just a few hours of placing my order , it had been shipped and i was provided with tracking_information .
0	in the end everything had arrived at my door in less_than 00_hours of placing my order .
0	i couldn_'_t be_happier !
0	not only that , but complete_aquatics kept me up to date with emails to let_me know as soon as my order had been processed and shipped .
0	this gave_me great peace of mind , as i knew what was going on with my order .
0	rather_than being left in the dark , as with some other_companies .
0	i will definitely be shopping with complete_aquatics in the future !
0	very quick to despatch the free delivery envelope & also to transfer the money .
0	i liked that i could track the exact progress of everything as well .
0	i am a big superdry fan and have brought many items for myself and others online and in store in the past .
0	my partner had been going on about the windcheeter jacket for months so i decided to buy him one for christmas to match mine .
0	after trying the item on and to his disappointment the jacket did not sit right so we decided to return it .
0	i was shocked to find that your policy_states that returns are not free and we could not return to any store for a full_refund !
0	after talking to the lady at the post_office she advised me that the normal recorded delivery would not cover the value of the jacket so i had to send it special delivery !
0	this is an outrage as that cost me nearly_£_00 !
0	!
0	my question to yourselves is why do you not provide the facility to return the items free of charge or in store to your loyal_customers ?
0	and upon talking to one if your representatives they informed me that the return would be free if the item was faulty ?
0	so i , as an honest customer am being scrutinised for being honest and doing the right thing !
0	why should it be one rule for one and one for another ?
0	this whole incident had left me feeling very disappointed in this company and will be cautious_about returning to you as a customer .
0	is there anything that can be done to resolve this issue ?
0	ordered quickly and easily using paypal .
0	as well as being the cheapest place to buy what i was looking for they had amazing service with email_updates throughout .
0	couldn_'_t recommend highly_enough .
0	i sent my phone by special delivery on tuesday , arrived with them around 00 :_00am after which i received an_email_telling_me it had arrived .
0	then received another email at 00 : 00 , stating the phone had been processed .
0	then received another email at 00 : 00 , stating payment had been made directly_into my account .
0	i then checked my account balance and sure enough the money was there .
0	not the top price quoted but i had heard terrible things about the company that did quote the top price .
0	well_worth going with mazuma , the price they quoted was the price they paid .
0	no replies to email , no answering the phone , possibly the worst customer service i have ever_experienced .
0	i ordered some clothes and after_reading_reviews online , 0_days after i placed the order i emailed them asking them how long the standard delivery would take and they sent it express delivery so i got with within 0 - 0_days , i was very happy .
0	however only one of the items were in a plastic_bag , the rest just loose , the jeans i recieved were a different shade of pink to the picture on the website , the denim shirt had a yellow stain on the back and the two tops i ordered were not a flattering fit .
0	i kept one plain_white vest and have been hoping to have my ' return request ' processed , however this has not happened and i am not waiting on the company to reply , meanwhile i '_m stuck with faulty items and my money tied up in the company .
0	it '_s been at_least 0_weeks no and no return !
0	no response !
0	absolutely terrible service , i '_m very unhappy .
0	after_reading the reviews i gave them the benefit of the doubt , but i have been very disappointed and unfortunatly , after this , won_'_t be ording with select again .
0	always very helpful !
0	i have had a few problems , stock issues on the website , so they don_'_t have the right stock i ordered and some faulty items .
0	but ark have always been very amenable and lets me know asap , sorted it out and any returns have been processed quickly and my postage refunded .
0	i think everything is very reasonably_priced the clothing is good quality !
0	one of my favourite shops online , for dresses to vintage jumpers , they ' re perfect !
0	i ordered an outfit for a work do , not only did it not arrive , i was told i '_d have to wait 00 days , for a refund , only they couldn_'_t get the dates correct so i '_ll be expected to wait two_weeks for my refund , and i won_'_t be getting my postage and packing back .
0	so i '_ve spent a lot of money for only stress and the support_team has_been less_than helpful .
0	i am beginning to get the feeling i will never get my money back , i won_'_t be using this service again .
0	i always use hostel_bookers whenever i book accommodation for my holidays and i have never had a bad_experience .
0	the accommodation is always exactly as_described when i arrive and the customer reviews are the best way to find out what you need to know about each place before you arrive .
0	its great to have a booking engine i trust and know will always deliver !
0	i always use them for all vitamins as they deliver free very quick and the products are high_quality and good value for money
0	value for money in these hard times and free delivery
0	i have always found my shopping_experience enjoyable and the staff are very helpful .
0	the goods were delivered before the date given and have never had problems returning goods .
0	i bought an automatic watering system from garden0less and it got delivered really quickly .
0	the items were exactly as_described .
0	when i had a question about the products and phoned customer_services , the man on he phone was very helpful .
0	i used partyrama to order some decorations for our stall for children in need .
0	i chose this website , because they had a wide_choice .
0	i received the products ahead of the promised time and they were just as_described , so i thought their service was excellent .
0	the items arrived in promised time and acceptable condition .
0	however , there are no previews on save the date or thank_you cards .
0	which i guess would be fine in most_cases , but in our case they couldn_'_t type the special character in the middle of my name .
0	and without preview we didn_'_t find this out until we received our order , so we had to manually correct on each card as it was too late to order new cards .
0	i think , the website should have a preview on everything considering the amount each customers spends .
0	also , from the website it wasn_'_t clear , that there will be no difference_between the thank_you and save the date cards .
0	as the evening invitation had evening invitation on the front , we wanted to use save the date cards to invite guests to our afternoon drinks reception celebrating our_wedding abroad .
0	but as the save the date '_s were the same as thank_you '_s we had add decorations to make them presentable .
0	so overall we were disappointed with the order .
0	we ordered our_wedding_invitation form here previously and they were lovely , so i guess we had higher expectations
0	i spoke to katie via the parcel0go . com live help chat online to gather more information .
0	the service was quick to respond and was free instead of calling which cost 00p from a bt landline .
0	would use this service again .
0	hostelbookers provided us with many options and locations for hostels in dublin .
0	as dublin is our first of many stops on our first - ever european backpacking_trip , we will_continue to use hostelbookers the whole way through if the service is the same in different cities / countries .
0	we are keeping a blog and social_media record about our experience and will be referring to hostelbookers throughout .
0	we found the perfect hostel in the heart of trinity college and dublin itself .
0	we were very excited to see that hostelbookers listed events that the times hostel provides .
0	actually , the special pub crawl on thursday_night was a pretty big selling point for us ;)
0	i was a little hasty when ordering flowers online for my mum for mothers_day , however i was very pleased with the email_updates throughout my order and dispatch process , and my mum was over the moon with the results !
0	especially the cute little instruction cards that came with the flowers .
0	thankyou very much
0	we are regular_users of hostel_bookers and always find the site simple .
0	to use .
0	it is very busy quick to make bookings and i find the reviews from other_travellers very useful .
0	ordered a personalised phone cover from tescos site !
0	and as i said i ordered a phone cover not a sticker !!
0	i was very disappointed when i received the envelope i expected a hard phone cover not a bit of paper !
0	i am outraged at the amount i paid for a bit of paper !
0	will never be ordering anything from tesco again
0	poor service - they refused to assemble our bed
0	we placed our order online for a sofa and bed and when the two guys from the brentford warehouse turned_up , they were rude , by refusing to remove their shoes before walking on our brand_new cream coloured carpet .
0	they brought the sofa in and put it together .
0	then they bought the bed in and said there you go all done .
0	i said " what about the bed ?"
0	they said " we don_'_t assemble beds , if we did we '_d be here for two hours ".
0	i said no , it says on your contract you must assemble all beds .
0	they said " no , that '_s just what the sales people do to make the sale .
0	we don_'_t know how to assemble beds ".
0	so my wife and i checked the website and then called dfs online help .
0	they confirmed that we were indeed supposed to have the bed assembled .
0	after confirming this will them they said " ok we '_ll give it a try but we don_'_t usually do it ".
0	they finally agreed to it and put it together in ten_minutes and said " there you go that one was an easy one ".
0	they tried to get me to sign without looking at the bed and sofa and when i looked at the bed they hadn_'_t even screwed the frame to the headboard properly - i could see it was loose .
0	it became_clear that all the while they had been attempting to pull a fast one .
0	after they left , we put the mattress over the bed_frame and the bed_frame immediately fell_apart .
0	we are currently_waiting for someone to come and fix it .
0	really disappointing service
0	i am a returning_customer of healthexpress . co . uk and the service is always impeccable : parcels arrive on time and the attention provided by the customer service is very personalised and efficient .
0	i saw a design i liked and searched online for the best deal .
0	i came_across blaze advertising the marc_jacobs sunglasses for a very competitive price .
0	i was impressed because postage was approx $ 0 opposed to the $_00 - $_00 postage fee that other_sites charge .
0	i ordered my sunglasses and was pleasantly impressed when they arrived all the was from the uk to south australia within 00 days .
0	i am very happy with my purchase and will be sure to be a returning_customer to blaze_sunglasses !
0	even_though the case i ordered wasn_'_t the one i needed bop dj were very accommodating in picking_up the case and providing a full_refund .
0	they were very pleasant and easy to get on touch with .
0	i would recommend using this company
0	shopping at poppy and zach is a lovely experience .
0	the shop has a boutique feel with beautiful products which have been displayed excellently .
0	unlike_some shops which have this quality , the staff are extremely friendly and attentive without making the customer feel_pressured .
0	there is a good range of products on offer and is a much needed and welcome_addition to leighton_buzzard .
0	i ordered two children '_s bow_ties and they arrived the next_day and are wonderful products .
0	very impressed with the site & service .
0	will use again .
0	this shizz works
0	no_problems on the site , found what i was looking for ( taken straight there by google actually ), got free next_day delivery and arrived next_day - cannot_fault at all !
0	well_done
0	this is the 0nd time i have used double0tickets !!
0	great service , would definitely use again !
0	this was my first time buying from feelgoodcontacts . com .
0	i ordered freshlook illuminate on saturday midnight and received them on monday .
0	very happy with the product - £ 0 . 00 per box , free first_class delivery .
0	you can '_t complain_about that !
0	the website is user_friendly - everything is so clearly_laid_out .
0	this is the first time i ordered from tshirtstudio and i must_say , i am one happy customer :) i ordered a personalised photo_keyring as a valentine gift .

0	i was supposed to be flying to germany this morning , to see my family over christmas .
0	due to weather_conditions , i checked the airport site for planned departures last night and to my surprise , my flight didn_'_t come up .
0	then i called the airport but neither they could find my flight number on their records .
0	panicked , i called the airline and found out , that they don_'_t even fly on sundays !
0	after an_hour on the phones , upset and tired , i realized , that this is a scam andhad to choose between two options : not see my family and spend christmas on my own , or find another last_minute flight .
0	well , i chose the second option and spend £_000 on top of my original price .
0	for the sake of £_00 i could have been at home now , now i have spend nearly_£_000 to get there !
0	very sad and feeling violated , i can '_t_believe this people can live with themselves !
0	please be aware of this scam , i fly very often and this looked like a genuine low_cost website , receiving confirmation_email and text_message .
0	be careful !

0	thanks to emily whom chatted with my partner today , and sorted_out the massive confusion of where my 0 parsells where as nobody_else could she found out where they were and explained why they where in the wrong place and sorted_out that my parcel will be either re directed back to me or delivered to the right address asap .
0	valued my mobile , had a great valuation .
0	the freepost_envelope was here straight_away !
0	sent my mobile to mazuma and had the cheque straight_away too !!
0	excellent !
0	thanks mazuma !
0	bought my new blue panasonic tz00 camera on friday and got it on monday_afternoon .
0	it was my first online purchase for digital_cameras so i was very cautious_about choosing a right dealer .
0	since i required them to deliver to my work address they asked for a prove of my billing_address , but no more hussle .
0	very pleased with my camera , geniue and bargain price !
0	plus there have been problems about the stock of these cameras , i originally ordered one from another online dealer but they said they were out of stock until end of this month / beginning of next month , so i cancelled that order and am now very happy that i got hold of one so soon with a much_lower price !
0	received a £_00 voucher in the post from tesco , worth the saving ;)
0	ive used this store before without_any_problems , always quick to deliver and respond to any_problems .
0	this time i thought i '_d test out the pay by cash facility at techdna .
0	ordered an n0 vision router on 00 / 00 /_0000 at around 00am and checked out with pay by cash .
0	it gave_me a receipt to print out and take to a paypoint outlet .
0	paid it and by the time i got home had received an_email_saying the payment was received ( 00 :_00am ).
0	item arrived 0_days_later .
0	well impressed .
0	will use again .
0	oh my word , what can i say - the villa was outstanding !
0	we went to villa eleana at aphrodite hills for my friend '_s wedding , and it was amazing .
0	they were so helpful from choosing what villa , what extras to have in the bride to be '_s wedding package , things to help keep our 0 year_old entertained etc , to where to go for day trips , meals out , help with car_rental etc .
0	i would highly_recommend them again , and the bride says that james_villas really took the ' stress ' out of healing to organise a wedding abroad and making it a perfect day .
0	quite simply , they know what they ' re good at , and my word they do it well .
0	thank_you for a wonderful holiday !
0	amazing photos at good prices with grey customer ssrvice
0	0lbs of whey_protein for $_00 !
0	amazing !!!
0	works great and tastes fantastic , thank_you so much !
0	following a family_bereavement i needed to return to the us for a close family_member '_s funeral and to be with my family .
0	i purchased my tickets online and recieved a confirmation_email and the funds were taken from my account that evening .
0	however , on arriving at the airport i was told that my flights had been cancelled by opodo !
0	at no point did opodo make contact to let_me know .
0	the virgin_atlantic desk staff were very helpful and contacted opodo on my behalf , but it took us 00_mins just to get through to someone that could help !
0	we then found that due to an_error on opodo '_s part , the money was never transferred to virgin_atlantic .
0	after a very distressing hour or so of waiting they were able to sort_out my tickets with about 00_mins to spare .
0	i can only classify this as gross incompetence by opodo , a site which my husband has used and trusted since 0000 , and feel both disappointed and let_down that a travel_agent would make this sort of mistake .
0	there was also a significant chance that because of opodo ’_s error , i would have missed the funeral , something which could not be undone .
0	my suggestion - take your business elsewhere !
0	i posted my phone ( special delivery ) on the saturday and by monday lunch_time , i received an_email to say that the money had been transfered_into my bank_account .
0	i got the full_amount i was quoted on line .
0	i '_m a very satisfied_customer and would highly_recommend mazuma !
0	!
0	after_trawling_through loads of websites to find a suitable trampoline for my 0 year_old , i came_across this company .
0	when i called their sales line , the lady gave game some great advice and helped_me choose the right one for my little_girl .
0	they were very friendly and helpful and the item was very reasonably_priced and arrived the next_day .
0	i now have a very happy , bouncing toddler !
0	!
0	would deffo use them again in the future
0	i was very pleased when i found the uke that i love at a much_cheaper price than on other music sites .
0	i was a little_worried at first as i read these reviews .
0	when i checked out i specified a delivery day , that day came around i received an_email_saying that it would be delivered the following_day .
0	as i had purchased this item as a christmas gift i started to panic a little !
0	i have to say they sent me 0 further emails .. one saying the item was ready and one saying it was dispatched and as promised i received it the next_day .
0	fantastic uke ... beautiful in fact it also came with aquila strings which pleasantly_surprised me as they are the by far the best and it did not state that on the item description !!
0	so in regards to recommending the company yes i would , i am very pleased with the instrument and very satisfied with their communication .
0	product arrived very quickly and my emails were responded to promptly .
0	ive been with vodafone for over 00 years_now .
0	the family package is a god_send as i dont need to worry_about my son having credit and i can talk to my boyfriend who is 000_miles_away without_worrying_about using minutes and credit .
0	i also add a freedom pack every_month which are excellent value for money .
0	the signal is always excellent and have used customer_services twice and both_times have had a very helpful and productive service .
0	ordered an icetoolz chainwheel bolt tool and was very impressed with the speed of delivery .
0	the item i ordered was of high_quality and was packed well and sent out very quickly .
0	will_definately be shopping here again .
0	quality products and quality service .
0	ordered for the first time from boohoo and veiled items quickly and they were all good quality for money .
0	will be ordering again !
0	its been the first time i '_ve bought tickets from double0 and initially i was a litlle nervous .
0	i bought the tickets as a christmas_present , i found the website easy to use .
0	a couple of months later i received a phone_call from double 0 informing_me they now had the tickets available and would be posting them to me and wanted to confirm my mailing address .
0	tickets arrived_safely the next_day !!
0	!
0	they had even better prices for the same hostels .
0	definitely using this site in the future !
0	beauty_cow is on of the best sites ive ordered from soo fast .
0	came within i think a day or two and that was standard post .
0	impressed .
0	also all the products are lussh and well_worth the prices .
0	soo cheap .
0	i do lovee beauty_cow .
0	keep_up the good work :)
0	i couldn_'_t_believe_how cheap supplementwarehouse . com '_s prices are compared to other stores .
0	even with shipping it was still less_than what i would pay to go to places like gnc or vitaminshoppe !
0	we received excellent service from jack_walton , from our initial_query and quote up until we received our items .
0	he communicated the progress of our order so we knew what was happening .
0	very impressed .
0	thank_you .
0	my experience with protectmybubble was fine until i needed to make a claim .
0	the claim was a long process and getting a response was not quick considering we are in the age of advanced technology .
0	i then asked a query which_meant that my claim could not be processed until i had received an answer .
0	i am still_awaiting the answer and can '_t yet claim .
0	i have sent another email reminding them i am awaiting an answer .
0	i may consider cancelling my insurance , especially as i received my renewal today and it is not a good price considering my phone is a year older and i am being charged the same price ... if i had known it would be this difficult to make a claim i would not have joined protect my bubble .
0	added to on 00 / 00 / 00 , funny how after writing this review i got lots of help , followed advice given and now it '_s disappeared again , and i still have a broken phone !
0	updated on 00 / 00 / 00 : after emailing the company several more times and getting no reply , including when i asked how i go about cancelling , i have just emailed them and asked them to cancel my policy .
0	i am beginning to think this is the way that they make their money , they insure your phone , when you make a claim they don_'_t respond so you get sick and tired for waiting and cancel your contract .
0	they therefore have had a whole years money out of me for nothing .
0	the only other solution is perhaps they have gone_bust and that '_s is why they are not replying to emails ?
0	i will certainly not be recommending this insurance company to anyone .
0	this has_been a very disapoiting and unsatisfactory experience .
0	updated on 00th_october_0000 .
0	as expected i got a reply from the cancellation department saying they had cancelled my contract less_than 00_hours after asking them too .
0	do not insure with this company they do not fulfill their obligations and won_'_t get back to you when it comes to them paying out .
0	avoid !
0	eflorist are a company i would recommend .
0	the ordering process is simple and effective .
0	there were no_problems using this site to place an order unlike a very well_known florist .
0	an_email to confirm the order was sent , which was good as it put my mind at rest , knowing that the order was registered , again , unlike a very well_known florist .
0	the flowers were beauitful and it was a smooth_transaction .
0	the discount was much_appreciated and the fact that there is another discount for my next order is great .
0	i would recommend this company to anyone_wanting a smooth , simple , trustworthy and effective florists and i will use them again when i next need to send flowers .
0	an_email / text_confirming the flowers have been successfully delivered would be even better .
0	gameseek provided quick service and kept me updated about my order throughout the process .
0	would definitely recommend !
0	i can '_t_believe_how much money i have saved buying my spices and herbs from you !
0	everything came packed really well and exactly as i expected .
0	fast delivery , what more could i ask for :-)
0	posted out my phone , and the money was in my account lunch_time the next_day , first_class service !
0	all went_smoothly and i was over the moon with how much i got and it was paid straight_into my bank , now that '_s what i call efficient .
0	thanks mazuma x
0	customer service started off amazing !
0	needed to cancel an order called them up he said it would be cancelled and refunded straight_away .
0	received an_email to confirm it .. so far so good ..
0	however
0	now i am £_000 down because the refund was never given , if i call them up they tell me it has_been refunded to get in touch with my bank so i did ..
0	still no sign of a refund 00 days_later ..
0	disappointed !
0	!
0	approved ghd sellers , yet much_cheaper_than_anywhere_else ( i did extensive_research !).
0	i ordered the straighteners on sunday , opting for the free delivery , and they arrived on the tuesday_morning !
0	i would definitely recomment this company .
0	thanks beautycow !
0	i ` ve ordered on 00 / 00 /_0000 and i still didn `_t get my item .
0	today is 00 / 00 /_0000 , and i have no feedback regarding where the product is .
0	i ` ve already sent a lot of messages , but nobody answered me !
0	just bought my car insurance from its0women .
0	saved me over_£_000 would highly_recommend .
0	website was really easy to use .
0	found everything i needed and arrived pretty quickly .
0	items were great quality .
0	overall really pleased
0	i came_across linda at holidays_please by complete accident !
0	i thought i had contacted the company who i had booked my honeymoon through as they had provided good service , however i am pleased i got hold of the wrong company .
0	i wanted to book with a company that could give me great service , sound_advice and good rates , linda at holidays_please provided all of this and more .
0	we were considering a few options and linda listened to what we wanted and found us the best rates .
0	we went back and forth a number of times with a number of routes before finding our ideal trip .
0	i also benchmarked prices i could get by booking direct with travel companies online , thinking that linda would struggle to match or come close to the deals i could achieve direct , but i am pleased to say i was wrong and via their industry contacts they could outbeat the prices i was being offerred .
0	i am always_willing to pay a bit extra for outstanding service but linda was able to offer both outstanding service and competitive_prices .
0	i will definitely be contacting linda again for further holiday advice before making direct bookings myself .
0	i have never dealt_with a company who provides next_day delivery for free !
0	i '_m so impressed with them i never knew people like this existed !
0	i '_m 000_% satisfied with their service and couldn_'_t have asked for more !
0	plus even better the jacket looks absolutely fab !
0	i '_d advise anyone and everyone to get their country gear from this place and i will most definitely be using them again .
0	they ' re so good i '_m actually shocked !
0	v . happy customer !
0	the price is good .
0	however , as far as i could see they did not tell you before paying that you would need to provide evidence to show you are not a fraud .
0	what if i had not had such evidence , and yet still would have paid nonetheless ?
0	for some reason after a while they seemed to change their mind and send me the code anyway ... am i no_longer suspicious then ?
0	i understand the need to dig_out frauds , but needing to provide evidence after purchase is ridiculous and needs to be made more clear .
0	to end on a positive however , the code did arrive quickly once the former was sorted .
0	i have bought a few items from here and every thing was excellently_priced , awesome quality and really fast delievery .
0	never had a problem .
0	i will deffo buy from here in the future :-)
0	after trying the gevey card , this service is the best !!
0	less_than 00 hour and i can use my iphone with a new carrier !
0	ive used hostelbookers now numerous_times in many different_countries and always found them amazing .
0	the website it easy to use and im yet to find anywhere_else cheaper .
0	its always my first point of call :)
0	andy came he was very proffesional and quick would use again
0	ordered my prints straight from my phone and had them delivered to the door within a few_days .
0	the prints are excellent quality , better_than i had expected them to be as some phone pictures can be bad quality when printed .
0	would definitely use again for prints and i will be recommending them to anyone_else looking prints
0	when things go well asos are great but if you have problems - wrong items or returns they are a nightmare .
0	they state returns will be dealt_with in 00_hours so when mine hadn_'_t been dealt_with in 0_days of then receiving it ( you can check this on the collectplus tracking website so i have proof it got there at that time ) i emailed them they said they don_'_t have it wait another week !
0	an_absolute_joke when there '_s proof .
0	this isn_'_t a one off either 0 of my recent orders have had issues .
0	i suppose i was daft to keep ordering from them but i '_ve learnt my lesson now and i '_d won_'_t be using them again they '_ve had enough chances .
0	if there '_s any chance you '_ll need to return something i '_d seriously_consider if the hassle is worth it .
0	items came quickly and well_packaged - no_problems .
0	arrived really quickly and well_packaged .
0	couldn_'_t ask for better .
0	placed an order in middle of march_0000 .
0	item had not arrived .
0	after 0_weeks i contacted them to be told it was not dispatched .
0	then heard from them a month later 00 / 0 / 00 to say it was dispatched and to go to my royal_mail office to see if it is there which it wasn_'_t .
0	i contacted them for refund and was told no .
0	only for them to refund me in may with out letting_me know .
0	i wish i had researched the company before buying from it as there is loads of other people in same boat as me on other review site .
0	please look before buying as the item they sell are needed right away not 0months later .
0	i live in northern_ireland , and the only place a seen a halloween_costume i liked was at fancy_dress ball .
0	it was a last_minute order and i was worried it wouldn_'_t be here on time , i ordered it on the monday using standard delivery and item came the very next_day , was very pleased , item was as_described and delivery very fast will order from them again .
0	i had a sideboard delivered yesterday and i was impressed by how courteous and helpful your delivery men were .
0	i have recently_moved_into a second floor_flat and have had a number of very negative experiences with rude and unhelpful delivery men who complain_about the two flights of stairs .
0	the sideboard is beautiful too .
0	i am a very happy customer !
0	the item was not delivered when it was supposed to be and the driver did not call to let_me know that there was a problem .
0	very disappointed with the standard of the service as i had to call them before they told me of the situation .
0	i can '_t fault the service i '_ve had from glasses_direct , from cancelling and order ( customer service was great , polite and extremely_helpful ) to the speed at which i got my new order .
0	just great .
0	my mother ordered me a ted_baker ladies watch a couple of week_ago .
0	we have it the 00 working_days delivery estimate but it has still not arrived !
0	we have emailed wowcher twice but still no response !!
0	!
0	after_spending a lot of time finding the best place to have laser_eye_surgery - ultralase was the obvious choice !
0	from the moment you walk through the door , the service received is excellent .
0	the staff had extensive_knowledge of the surgery and my mind was put at rest in all areas i had concerns .
0	on the day of my surgery , i was very well looked after , and this level of service continued throughout my after care .
0	thank_you very much !
0	when i moved in to my ( single occupier , one bedroom ) flat in sept_0000 i was told that the supplier was npower and silly me , i didn_'_t think to look at a site like this to check them out .
0	although , looking at the reviews below , switching wouldn_'_t have helped .
0	i sent off a direct_debit mandate as normal , and some time had passed before i realised i hadn_'_t heard_anything from them .
0	i rang them up and the advisor had some trouble getting a direct_debit into the system .
0	he eventually managed it at an amount of £_00 per_month and i thought nothing of it until may , when i cancelled the direct_debit in error and i couldn_'_t get another set_up over the phone because of their new systems ( i called the next_day ).
0	i was told by one advisor that i had an economy 00 meter ( correct ) and i would have to get the meters removed and a standard one put in as they couldn_'_t bill the meter on their systems ( bullshit ).
0	i rang my landlady to check with her and then rang npower back to be told by another advisor that it would be fine - a ' complex metering team ' would calculate the bill manually and a new direct_debit would be set_up when they did that .
0	did they hell .
0	i '_ve been having to make monthly manual payments since then as they didn_'_t manage to bill me until august .
0	i chased this many_times after_hearing no reply and eventually complained .
0	each member of staff in customer_services seemed to have a different idea of what timescales this complex metering team work to and they seem to say anything to fob you off and get you off the phone .
0	when they billed me they transposed the readings from each meter and evidently couldn_'_t be bothered to set_up the direct_debit so they closed my case down .
0	i rang in ( lost_count of how many_times since may ) to get it sorted_out and received another bill today with a debit of £_000 . 00 on the account , so they have billed me for £ 0 , 000 . 00 between 00 sept 00 and 0 sept 00 .
0	again , single occupier in a 0 bed flat .
0	again they haven_'_t set_up a direct_debit or acknowledged the complaint so i '_ve sent them a message using their contact form telling them ( moderately politely ) that they are imbeciles .
0	they are demanding payment for the 0rd_october_0000 .
0	oh , and all their correspondence seems to reach me a week after it '_s dated so god only knows what '_s going on there .
0	the last time i received a reply from the contact forms , it was clear that they had taken zero notice of the notes on my account so i had to ring in anyway - not expecting much this time , since i received an acknowledgement email_telling_me that they are getting more correspondence than usual ( i wonder_why (!))
0	and that it will take them longer_than normal to reply .
0	well that '_s just brilliant .
0	so , after numerous phone_calls to complaints and customer_services , one written complaint and a couple of complaint forms later , the issue has not been resolved and i have been left with a debt that they have let accrue on my account because they couldn_'_t bill me for a year .
0	who '_s to say the amount is right anyway ?
0	sounds_like from other people they seem to charge whatever they want and don_'_t care less about how it affects people .
0	so , unless you like being put under unnecessary_stress and love being charged insane amounts of money , don_'_t use npower .
0	i ordered a hair product from them as i couldn_'_t find a better price anywhere_else .
0	they have a voucher_code that can be used to get 00_%_off your first order if you sign up to their newsletter .
0	they dispatched my item promptly , very pleased .
0	i ordered 0 items on monday_morning , and recieved emails for each one informing_me that each had been sent to the courier ( 0 with yodel and 0 with hermes ).
0	not realising that tesco used these couriers i was a little_worried , as yodel has a terrible reputation .
0	however , the items from yodel were delivered on tuesday_afternoon , very impressed !
0	however , one of the items had a part missing , so i emailed customer_services asking for it to be posted out to me , as i was recluctant to phone the 0000 number .
0	i recieved a phone_call from a very friendly lady informing_me that i could have a replacement delivered and they would pick_up the old one at the same time on thursday .
0	i recieved the hermes parcel on wednesday , and the swap was fine on thursday .
0	all this was from the £ 0 delivery option which promised delivery by the saturday , very pleased !
0	as i had the week off work , this was very convenient , but had i been at work it would have been quite awkward with no one to collect packages .
0	would definitely use again .
0	this is a cobuying website where you can join cobuys for various_types of products , mainly beauty and cosmetics , and get discounts off these products by doing so .
0	the best deal i have gotten was a lovely delonghi toaster for £_00 , would have cost me around £_00 elsewhere .
0	they can sometimes take a while to dispatch , but if they take longer_than 0_days ( which has only happened once in all the time i have been cobuying with them ) they will send you a courteous email_apologising and explaining the delay .
0	this is a very fun way to shop , just make_sure you can '_t get the item including the delivery price cheaper anywhere_else .
0	i signed_up to quidco a few_months_ago , and i am generally pleased .
0	but , why is there no general ' contact us ' feature ?
0	my clicksnap thing refuses to work as it states i have the wrong log in details .
0	i tried to contact quidco , and found i could only view some useless faq_section which does not allow you to send them a message .
0	the mobile checkins are great as these are not included in the retention_fee , but sometimes the app has problems and you cannot check in .
0	on the whole , i like this company and all of my transactions with them have gone_smoothly .
0	delivery and dispatch are usually quite quick , and they often have huge discount days .
0	the problem with this site , is firstly , the swatches of the products .
0	it is impossible to tell what shade you are in their foundations , and even some of the nail_polish swatches are completely_untrue to real_life .
0	secondly , the quality of the products varies so much !
0	you can buy a product , love it , then repurchase it and it will be horrible !
0	i don_'_t understand_why they don_'_t have better quality control .
0	even some of their more_expensive products have problems .
0	i bought a lipgloss from their mineral range and the packaging is so bad you can barely get any out of the tube !
0	not sure if i would buy anything again .
0	i recently got a new phone line when i had internet installed .
0	immediately , the phone_calls started from some unknown number .
0	they kept asking for a woman_who does not and has never lived at my address .
0	i told them this time and again and they still refused to stop calling .
0	i asked them to update their records and still they wouldn_'_t .
0	the person calling would never introduce themselves , or explain_why they were calling , which i find appallingly rude .
0	i eventually looked up the phone number to find a few people had experienced similar treatment .
0	i rang the number to find that in fact it was natwest home insurance !
0	i thought it was some kind of debt_collection agency the way they were acting !
0	i forwarded a complaint via their website telling them to sod_off ( mostly politely ) and i recieved a letter saying they would look into my complaint .
0	i have not had any further letters but hurrah , they have stopped calling me !
0	i used their home delivery service to get some furniture .
0	i was unable to get time off work for the delivery slot they allocated me , so i rang them to change it .
0	i was on hold for around 00_mins on an 0000 number to get it changed from tuesday to friday .
0	i came home from work on the tuesday to find that delivery had been attempted .
0	i was furious that i had spent money trying to get a delivery slot changed and they hadn_'_t even done it properly .
0	i was able to change it with the courier , luckily but sent a complaint to ikea .
0	a woman phoned me regarding my complaint and treated me as if i was stupid and i had gotten it wrong !
0	when i explained i had recieved an_email that confirmed the friday delivery slot still no apology .
0	would not use again .
0	i saw a throw at the norr00 showroom in berlin but had no room in my luggage .
0	i was pleased to find they had a website and that they shipped to the uk .
0	i ordered my throw - i now own my throw and it is gorgeous !
0	i am a very happy_camper .
0	there was no sympathy option for flowers to the us so i chose a florist '_s choice bouquet to send my condolences .
0	i had emails from two people commenting on the beautiful flowers .
0	sounds_like a good job to me .
0	thank_you .
0	amazing value and so quick !
0	im_glad i found this website ,
0	i was about to post my phone on ebay but luckily i found this .
0	the cost of my phone on ebay is £_000 excluding vat , paypal fees but fonebank qouted me £_000 and sent the phone on monday and received the payment into my bank_account on wednesday !
0	thanks fonebank !
0	my opinion of supplement_warehouse is only half formulated because i haven_'_t received my order , but the ordering aspect of my dealings with supplement_warehouse was pleasant as the prices were fair , and the free_samples were nice ... minus the shipping part of it .
0	lol
0	i would recommend supplement_warehouse to my friends and family ... possibly even ahead of gnc , as i am a member .
0	for the first time i used wowcher i never received my items and when i tried to log in to find out the apparently my account then didn_'_t exist !
0	when i contacted them i got a reply to say i had an account but no voucher had been used yet clearly the money had been taken out of my account !
0	been a month and still_waiting for my refund and for them to get back to me !
0	disgusting stay well clear !
0	for 00 years my family have been loyal orange / ee customers and are suposedly " valued_customers " are we heck !!
0	this term means nothing to the company or it '_s staff !
0	for three_weeks now i have been paying £_00 a month for an iphone that i cannot use due no service .
0	i have been back and forth_between phoning the company and going into a ee store and no one seems to be able to sort_out my problem !
0	it '_s beyond a joke and the company simply do not care !!
0	i would never ever use this service and given the option i would leave in a flash !
0	secondly what ever they have told you about being the fastest network with the best coverage is a lie !
0	i get rubbish coverage wherever i am and recieve less_than half the broadband i pay for !
0	for first timers looking into ee do not do it !
0	o0 all the way from now on !!!!
0	extreamly unsatified customer !
0	oak_furniture_land have been fantastic .
0	everything from the service in store , through to delivery & quality has_been great .
0	they called , text & emailed to say when my items would arrive .
0	the driver called me 00_minutes before they arrived & said they would be with me within 00_minutes , which of course they were .
0	i '_ve had complaints with several other big firms & was expecting there to be an issue with this too but far from it !
0	i will be the first one complaining & kicking off if things aren_'_t up to scratch but this experience has_been fantastic , & i would definitely recommend them .
0	items arrived very quickly , beautifully_packaged - super reasonably_priced , couldn_'_t fault it !
0	i have 0 pre_- order item ( red kite walker ) in this order under " pre_- order for may delivery ” status , which was placed on tuesday , 0st may .
0	i received my items within 0_days , but the walker .
0	i know it '_s a pre_- order item , so i waited for another week .
0	waiting .. waiting ... on 00th_may , i emailed them as to when the walker would be in stock .
0	they said it was cancelled because they received a cancellation_request email on 0th_may for the item and was refunded .
0	i did not send them email with regards to this order until i asked when the item was likely to despatch !!!
0	i was angry because they just cancelled the item i had been waiting for without telling_me it was cancelled .
0	they should at_least send me an_email to confirm this .
0	i emailed them back on the same day and said that i did not cancel it and asked them to forward me the cancellation_request email they got .
0	i also further send them another email to reinstate my order back to original status .
0	they replied on 00th_may saying they could not retrieve the cancellation_request email and explained my card would be charged again if they placed and order to the item and it could be delivered in may .
0	( later , a reply from the manager in a separate complaint email said they only kept customer '_s email for 0_days !!!!!!!
0	shocking for such an important_thing !!!)
0	i asked the customer_services for confirmation when it would be delivered on saturday , 00th_may , but no reply from them till now .
0	i wrote an_email to the complaints team too on the same day .
0	the manager replied_saying their staff did recall i cancelled it ( but they could not prove it !)
0	and the item would not be delivered unless i approve the payment from them again .
0	they were basically saying they did not do anything wrong !
0	the email i got was sorry on the surface , but they were saying they were right and not sympathetic whatsoever or do i get any compensation for it .
0	they should have better communications to customers .
0	things like this will be avoided if we do get emails about status of our order .
0	even when i tracked the order status on their website , there was no note about the cancellation on 0th_may or any other notes , apart_from a note about another item in this order that was going to be despatched , dated 0nd may .
0	first of all the concept is more complicated than first expected and very little explanation is given .
0	i then got charged_twice for my wowcher and when i complained , they told my that " it hadn_'_t got as far as them and paypal was responsible " this turned_out to be a lie when i called paypal , who contacted them and sorted it .
0	to top it all off the product supposedly had a sale price of £_00 . 00 , and i was getting a fantastic deal for £_00 . 00 .
0	upon further_investigation , the average sale for the item on other_sites was £_00 . 00 .
0	i have been mucked around and ripped_off .
0	i will not be using wowcher again .
0	ordered ghd_air over the weekend and arrived on tuesday .
0	great delivery , price and really love the hairdryer .
0	it drys my hair in no time and leaves it feeling great with a salon finish .
0	beautycow are a excellent company to do_business with .
0	will def use them again .
0	thanks beautycow
0	a great company .
0	their immune boosting products are reasonably_priced for what they do .
0	finally tried an introductory box and both my husband and i were very impressed by the quality if the sausages , burgers and pork_chops .
0	they were all very meaty and better_than any other equivalent product we had bought from the supermarket top range .
0	only minor_criticism is that the steaks were quite_thin so lacked the juiciness we usually enjoy but would still be willing to try other steaks
0	i posted my phones by recorded delivery tuesday_afternoon .
0	wednesday_morning i received an_email to confirm they had received my phones .
0	00_minutes after that , i received an_email to say that my order was complete and a cheque was being dispatched that day .
0	thursday , i received the cheque !!!
0	it would have been even quicker_than that had i opted to have the money paid directly_into my bank !!!!
0	i '_ve already_recommended mazuma to a friend !!
0	!
0	before you book or go on your holiday go on trip_advisor i wish we had before going to turkey , didn_'_t make the same mistake twice and it really helped with our trip to salou
0	i am due to go on holiday in july and thought this would be great for some cheap and cheerful clothes , how wrong was i ?
0	they have very few select items that are 00plus therefore i now have to go elsewhere and spend extra money al because they don_'_t cater for the bigger lady .
0	good communication , very quick dispatch .
0	good range of delivery options .
0	easy to use website
0	very good service , fast dispatch .
0	would recommend to a friend and will be returning to purchase more items for my dogs .
0	we booked the premium transfers from and to barcelona_airport a week before our trip and it was worth the money - the cards were shiny black and brand_new , clean inside out and very luxury .
0	the driver met us at the airport and took us to the hotel and a different driver picked us up a few_days_later , but they both were very polite and nice .
0	the only_negative_comment i could make is that they both were driving extremely fast , probably twice the speed limit ( n . b .
0	we are in our late twenties and drive every day ourselves !
0	), but it must be a spanish thing :)
0	spoke to sammy taylor she made me feel very comfortable and was clear and concise with her advice
0	i had been on other_websites , but found that hostelbookers gave a 00_%_discount on my selected hostel in nice .
0	it was really easy to book the hostel and it saved me a fair_amount of money .
0	thanks hostelbookers .
0	great service .
0	a colleague of mine used this service back in july and it was excellent .
0	however , on the accounts side i was getting_frustrated that i couldn_'_t optain an invoice .
0	but today after_speaking to daniel on the live help i found out that i was looking for the wrong information from the wrong company .
0	within minutes of giving my reference_number daniel had it all sorted for me .
0	what a speedy service !!!
0	i will_definately but using them again both for business and personal deliveries !
0	thz for the experince , great all_round , will be back when i get more mobiles .
0	i couldn_'_t_believe_how quickly they delivered my item and what great condition it was in when it arrived straight to my door .
0	i would highly_recommend
0	they picked the item up and delivered exactly when they said they would and a friendly guy delivered it straight to my door .
0	my baby daughter ruined my msi u000 netbook by spilling a drink on it , so i desperately_needed a decent new one ( as i rely_on it for my income ), at a really good price ( as i really could have done without having to by a new one due to money issues !
0	).
0	i brought the acer eeepc 0000p - selling on ebay at around £_000 , but save on laptops doing it for £_000 !
0	i ordered it bank_hol monday ( after a desperate weekend trying to dry the other one out to no_avail ), it arrived wednesday !
0	so not even 0_days work lost !
0	- excellent service , they must have come_back to any number of orders tuesday_morning but this did not in any way delay the despatch of my new netbook , couldn_'_t ask for more and will_definately recommended to anyone who needs a new laptop at a great price and in a hurry !
0	i make my sons baby formula and they have almost all of the ingredients that i need at a much_lower price !
0	i saved over_$_00 on my last order !
0	when i came_across your website i was immediately attracted to the arrangements and the variety and for very reasonable_prices .
0	i was taken with you and found what i wanted immediately .
0	i was very reassured receiving texts at every point of the transaction and really appreciated the delivery options as my mum is not always guaranteed to be in .
0	your choices of bouquets and arrangements are second to none and really different .
0	i will definitely use your services again .
0	thank_you for making my mums day .
0	not only was the process of valuing and selling online easy and painless , the envelope arrived the next_day and the money was wired to me the same day they received my mobiles .
0	excellent service and i will definitely both recommend and use again ,
0	i was really impressed with the easy to use website .
0	the videos_showing the different fridge_freezers was a real help when deciding which one to order .
0	the ordering process was simple and being_able to choose the delivery day meant i could organise my time .
0	receiving texts was a good little touch , the day before delivery i was text the name of the driver .
0	on the morning of delivery the driver rang and gave_me an estimated time of arrival and when they arrived the delivery was smooth and went without a hitch .
0	i '_d definitely use again and will recommend to friends and family .
0	to sum up i '_m a very happy customer !!
0	:-)
0	i '_ve purchased from healthy_supplies twice , and have had an excellent experience both_times .
0	i don_'_t know of another place in the uk where i can get all the healthy_supplies i need , and have them delivered to my doorstep so promptly .
0	i '_m so glad i came_across this website and decided to give it a shot .
0	plan to use it again and again !
0	i purchased several products from here .
0	the products arrived quickly , well_packaged and are the real deal .
0	i will definitely be purchasing from here again .
0	i was amazed as my parcel arrived first thing the next_day , as i ordered only the afternoon before .
0	my outfit was amazing will defiantly be buying from them again .
0	this is a great company !
0	i would even work here or definately buy shares if i could !
0	the staff are always accessible , friendly , and helpful .
0	the items were exactly as pictured , and the website is so much fun to shop in !
0	delivery was super_fast , even_though i am overseas !
0	really , great .
0	thank_you partyrama !
0	!
0	ordered a suitcase with next_day delivery - it took much longer to deliver and the suitcase arrived the day after i left .
0	disappointed as could have used another company for urgent delivery to receive it before the journey , not after ...
0	asked for clarification , the company didn_'_t bother replying ...
0	i '_ve booked with double0tickets twice_now , while there weren_'_t any real problems with either booking , there were little things the agents did that gave the impression that they would be very helpful if issues had arisen .
0	for example , they courtesy called me to give proper directions twice and remind about entrance hours for the first concert .
0	with the second , i managed to get a day ticket for reading_festival which was sold out absolutely everywhere .
0	everyone there seems very together and focused on great customer service .
0	they would probably be my first point to search for any tickets at the moment .
0	we had a french girl , elodie roche , very easy to speak french with her .
0	we had lots of problems and she was perfect , fast and lovely .
0	thanks a lot
0	i decided to purchase glasses over the internet due to ever_increasing prices on the high_street .
0	selectspecs was an easy website to use and the glasses on offer were very reasonably_priced !
0	delivery was as_described and i loved my glasses when they arrived .
0	i mainly wear contact_lenses , however , since the arrival of my selectspecs glasses , i have worn the contacts much less !
0	very pleased and would most definitely use selectspecs again !
0	!
0	mazuma is a great place to get_rid of any unwanted_phones .
0	i was surprised to find my nokia was worth £_00 !
0	the information pack was quickly delivered and once i '_d returned my phone , the payment was made straight_into my bank_account on the same day that it was received !!
0	happy customer , definitely worth looking through drawers for any old_phones knocking around !
0	thanks .
0	have ordered from this website several_times ... for sure the best priced there is for authentic products !
0	quick delivery , great communication and always reliable !
0	i have been using this company for over a year now and i think they are absolutely_faultless !
0	sometimes i order as much as 0 times a week so have had much experience with them and they are brilliant ..
0	i live in the netherlands and i always receive my package 0 working_days from ordering .. everything is always better_than i imagined and the quality is mostly fantastic considering that everything is just 0 pounds !
0	customer service is always efficient and helpful and i think the e0p team should all be very proud of themselves !
0	i ordered 0 yankee_candles which were very cheap with the 00_%_off offer , they arrived very quickly and were very well_packaged , will be ordering some more within the next few_days , very happy with the service
0	i could no have been happier with the service and quality of the products from flashbay .
0	i requested some samples and received the most impressive sample_pack i have ever_seen .
0	i received visual proofs within an_hour of requesting them and my order was received to days early .
0	will defiantly be using flashbay again .
0	at first it felt like an entertainment website , with " playful " fonts and colors so you assume it '_s gonna be easy to navigate_around .
0	and then , you realise that it is actually really easy to find your way around , but the content is far from shallow .
0	stats are useful and noticeable at first_glance , and there are lots of offers whether it '_s for a job or a flat .
0	i particularly_like the connectivity options , which make it more personalise and it feels_like you have an extra search assistant .
0	just hope they will soon open the job search to other_countries .
0	easy to order .
0	great service to compete with prices of other online competitors .
0	will definitely order again !
0	i highly_recommend supplement warhouse .
0	they have price match on all of their products to get the best deals .
0	they also have free products to go along with your order .
0	brilliant price and speedy service , will definitely use them again
0	wanted to send my aunty in france a thank_you bouquet so found iflorist online .
0	they offered delivery to her address at reasonable rates .
0	the flowers were delivered on time in perfect_condition and she was very pleased with her surprise !
0	will definitely use their service again .
0	terrible customer service , took nearly a year to resolve_issues with account when i left the property .
0	bounced from person to person and no one seemed to understand the query .
0	then at the end of this nightmare they opened the direct_debit account for the next occupier of the property where i had closed the account ... with my bank details and without my consent .
0	fast and efficient service from sarah_h , very very helpful indeed !
0	thanks for your help today :)
0	the price i was offered was great and the speed of the transaction was extraordinary , i will_definately use mazuma again !
0	!
0	i sent my phone off , with a note stating that the screen did not work however everything else did fine .
0	i even paid for special delivery .
0	next_day i got an_email_stating there was faults in that ' the power_button did not switch on or off ' which is not true at all , offering me £_00 . 00 for a samsung_galaxy_note .
0	either they employ people who can not read or who are too lazy to notice that the phone does turn on but it is just the screen , there is nowhere to state on the website when ' selling ' the phone what damages it has so you can '_t point it out to these morons .
0	totally peed off and wasted my money and time sending it .
0	( also because i rejected my offer they reported my review stating i '_m not a genuine customer , why just because i rejected the poor offer ?!)
0	i have now received my phone back , low and behold it does turn on ,
0	also i sent my phone in it '_s original box with charger .. only received the phone back !
0	contacted customer service and they are sending out a replacement box and charger .
0	printing . com have been excellent at giving us imaginative ideas , fantastic quality printing at great prices , and speedy delivery - 0_stars !
0	my dad bought me and my partner a mini_break but when we came to book it there were no weekend dates available and very limited midweek dates .
0	we ended_up with wowcher credit which we have managed to spend some of .
0	the remainder we will loose , as after checking the deals daily there hasn_'_t been anything we want .
0	i emailed wowcher to ask them to extend the credit .
0	after a week they have replied , refusing my request so we will now loose the money .
0	or i have 0_days to buy something i don_'_t even want .
0	i also noticed on numerous_occasions that the items selling are not discounted at all and in some cases are available much_cheaper elsewhere .
0	definitely shop around .
0	there are rugs on currently that were in aldi half the price .
0	also watch out for expensive delivery charges !
0	i '_ve rated wowcher 0 ☆ as i believe they do have malicious_intent .
0	they clearly don_'_t want to revise their credit policies because they are making so much !
0	can '_t think of another company that operates such an unfair returns / refund policy !
0	excelllent service - the whole_process took 0_days from_start to finish !
0	the prepaid_envelope came the day after i submitted the order , i posted the phones immediately , the following_day they received the phones and processed them .
0	the next_day the voucher arrived !
0	amazing !
0	a faultless service which i will_definately use again !
0	sky vegas is great to use , easy and reliable .
0	great service , received my order quickly with no_problems : 0 )
0	i ordered a washing_machine a while ago and had a good experience so i decided to buy a fridge_/_freezer from them as well .
0	i researched through their products and chose a model that worked for me .
0	i placed the order for the next_day delivery and only upon confirmation did i notice that the delivery date wasn_'_t for the next month .
0	then i had to wait on hold ( at 00p_per_minute ) to cancel the order .
0	they could have avoided this if they had just indicated that the item wasn_'_t in stock .
0	now they say it will be 0 - 00 days to refund my money - awful service !!!
0	!
0	i ordered well in_advance a nice bunch of flowers for my mother to be delivered on saturday as she works on a sunday .
0	it is now 0pm on the monday and they have still not arrived .
0	i payed a lot of money for these flowers and feel totally let_down .
0	when i eventually got though to iflorist on sunday_night ( they had been offline all day ) i got no apology .
0	they gave_me a link to the delivery tracking website which showed by flowers had been " in transit " since friday .
0	if they do ever arrive the flowers will be approaching the end of their natural life .
0	iflorist should not be taking our money if they cannot uphold their end of the bargain .
0	had they said they could '_t deliver on the saturday then i would have simply sent something_else .
0	i have emailed demanding a full_refund and have not received any word back as of yet .
0	very distressing interaction which has caused a lot of stress over the last few_days .
0	i will never use this company ever again .
0	given the number of other negative_reviews showing others being let_down also , i '_ve decided to write to trading_standards .
0	i recently made a booking , without_realising that i ' chosen the wrong option of payment .
0	after_speaking to a customer service advisor , lius martins , he resolved this over the phone in a very polite and helpful manner .
0	this has helped_me out a lot , stopping the worry and cunfusion on my behalf .
0	excellent customer skills , would definately book again with this company .
0	once i placed an order , i received numerous reminders to send my phone which was great as i kept forget to post my item .
0	within the next working day of posting my item , i got an_email_saying they received my image and sent my cheque in the post ( great fast service ).
0	i then received the cheque in the post the next_day .
0	thank_you so much for excellent service .
0	the price match is great but i often find that they are the cheapest anyway !!
0	fast and reliable i always check to see if sw has the item i am looking for before i look anyway else .
0	lol i got my whole family addicted .
0	from_start to finish i found the whole_experience fantastic - service was excellent and the speed superb - highley_recommend to anyone
0	ordered some flowers today for the mother '_s day weekend for my mother in law today and i always find browsing sites for items daunting but i must_admit that when i went on i found that what i would want is how it was all laid_out in front of me .
0	like a sit_down brochure .
0	i found something i liked really easy because of the lay_out of the pictures i even found a little gift balloon i could add .
0	bonus too was they gave the offer of free chocs and a card .
0	don_'_t get that everywhere !
0	anyway i ordered my flowers card balloon and put what i wished for them to put in the card and continued with ease to the checkout and voila !
0	all done .
0	instant email_confirmation came through and not over stressed by the whole_experience .
0	probably took longer to write this than order . lol it '_s that easy .
0	;).
0	congrats on a site that '_s not confusing . com !
0	;)
0	good reviews of good hostels .
0	it allows you to use the experiences of others , learning from their mistakes is better_than your_own .
0	easy to navigate the plentiful information .
0	excellent - quick delivery , well_packaged and very competitively_priced .
0	would thoroughly_recommend !
0	i ordered my costume on sunday and it came on wednesday .
0	i couldn_'_t_believe_how quick it came i thought it would take longer_than that so imagine my surprise when i came home from the cinema to find it sitting on my couch where my mum left it .
0	i would defiantly order from this site again love it .
0	i '_ve tried a few other hockey companies including barrington and gilmore sports and total_hockey are the only guys i '_ve_used time and time again without_any_issues .
0	every time the service is top_class , very personal , genuine , and they '_ll go out of their way to help you .
0	don_'_t be put off that they ' re based in ni , their delivery is quicker_than any other company i '_ve_used and unlike the others they '_ll let you know if it will be delayed !!
0	i ordered wednesday_morning and received my kickers on friday_morning as promised .
0	the sweeties are always a nice_touch too !
0	keep_up the good work :)
0	very fast very easy and very friendly service , also great quality costume .
0	thank_you x
0	i ordered a canvas_print on - line this week , i did not read the web_site correctly and to cut a long_story_short i said i would collect my item in person , this would be all and well if i lived in wales and not scotland , lol .
0	i called up as soon as i noticed what i had done and spoke to a very helpful guy_who not only helped_me ensure my order would be sent to me he was able to look at my picture and i explained about how i would like the pic in the back round taken out or moved if possible .
0	in the end i had an e . mail that very same night to say my order had been dispatched !!
0	to me that is amazing and a great service i have ' nt received my order as yet so can not comment on the quality of my canvas , however the service i received was 00 / 00 !!
0	cant_wait to see my canvas now !
0	!
0	from begining to end the process of selling my old phone was quick and easy !
0	payment was in my account the day my phone was received and the communication along the way was outstanding !
0	i loved my dress but the necklace was broken so had to send it back :( fast delivery and an_absolute_bargain :)
0	would defiantly recommend this store to anyone_wishing to purchase a new appliance i wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else always very helpful and excellent value for money :)
0	one of the best experiences so far , not only concerning the reservation procedure it self , but also on having great variety of reviews .
0	to sum it up , it '_s a great website .
0	plenty of options , and very fast to navigate too !
0	highly_recomended !
0	without a doubt the easiest hotel booking website i have used , it was easy and simple to select what i wanted and within_seconds i was presented with several options .
0	i found that compared to other_websites it offered the best deals and i particularly found it useful the way it presented each hotel on the map to show the best location .
0	i will definitely be using this site again for future_bookings .
0	my husband to be ordered some gifts for his best men , usher and reader in the form of a personalized engraved pocket watch and lighter .
0	what turned_up can only be described as a scratched engraving not a proper laser cut .
0	the delivery was also painfully_slow , and he has had to go and buy new gifts for everyone as we were not happy to give these to our friends .
0	we are now waiting on our_wedding_favours , which we also ordered from confetti , which have still not turned_up .
0	even_though the website displays delivery 00 days before the wedding date .
0	we ordered invitations , rsvp '_s and evening reception invites from the young love collection .
0	after going to order the order of service and menu closer to the wedding date it became_apparent that the collection was not available in anything_else !
0	why ?
0	then when we did settle for something_similar to that collection for the place cards and guest_book what was delivered was completely_different !
0	after_speaking to the customer_services it seems that what was displaying on the website was different to what they were reading in the warehouse .
0	when ordering something for a wedding on what is a very stressful time this did not help !
0	i have good experience of shopping with precious_little , i come_across a little_bit of delivery issue as i missed my delivery , but their sales represented helped_me to get that delivery same day ...
0	i have purchased quite a few item .. bedding , cot_bed , push_chair , mobile cot , changing_mat etc .
0	i will definitely recommend precious_little for shopping .
0	they have good customer service .
0	it '_s an easy website to fine as you can compare the price difference to other website .
0	prompt service and realisable .
0	easy access to where the tickets needs to be collected .
0	well_done horray .
0	ordered a couple of fox t - shirts on monday , received today ( wednesday ) really pleased and i got some free sticker !
0	good work freestylextreme
0	first time i have used double 0 and i would highly_recommend this site again and will be using it for every concert etc that i wish to attend .
0	tickets arrived the next_day special delivery
0	thanks so much double 0 you are now my guilty_pleasure
0	kate
0	i never have an issue with the service from very .
0	i order and receive next_day with collect_+, so no delivery charge there and if it needs to be ordered to the house i am more than happy to pay for the delivery .
0	what '_s great is , i can more or less book in what day i want to the goods delivered .
0	currently_waiting on a bed for my wee one but it stated low stock and the availability date at point before purchase , so really can '_t grumble with that .
0	when i got this account , i also signed_up for a littlewoods account and instantly noticed that very had the cheaper prices for their highly branded items .
0	returns are also very simple , all done online for my smaller items |( haven_'_t had to return bigger items ).
0	can go to the post_office , back to collect_plus or drop it with the local drop box .
0	even your account tells you how many days you have left to return a certain item and i love you can buy two different_sizes , find the best fit and then return the one you are not wanting .
0	i have never had to contact customer service , everything completed online !
0	big_thumbs_up x
0	very friendly staff , and a fast response to problems i had .
0	would fully recommend them
0	i spoke to paul on live_chat and he was very helpful and dealt and helped_me with my enquiry very quickly x
0	i booked a room online for the 00st_december till the 0st of january , which a friend of mine clearly saw me correctly input .
0	i handed_over my bank details , was forced to take alpharoom '_s insurance in order to make the booking and agreed to a no cancelation policy as i definitely was going for a special new year '_s eve .
0	only at the end of booking the receipt said i had booked the room for the 00st_jan to the 0st_feb !
0	of course i called alpharooms straight_away as there had been some terrible mistake in their website system .
0	i couldn_'_t get through , the line was just dead .
0	i then called the hotel , they kindly called alpharooms on my behalf , alpharooms agreed to call me .
0	they called and then hung_up on me .
0	i called the hotel again and this time the hotel connected me directly to alpharooms .
0	i explained there had been some mistake in their system as both myself and my friend had clearly saw me input the 0st january for the the check out date .
0	they said it was tough_luck and i would still be charged !
0	they tried to tell me they " couldn_'_t do refunds as they would be charged by the hotel " ( this was not true as i had spoken directly to the hotel who have a policy of canceling up until the day before , especially if there had been some serious mistake like this .
0	alpharooms refused to change the wrong date to another , they were very unhelpful , saying it was my fault !!
0	and finally agreed to just a 00_% refund on my money .
0	they basically stole 00 pounds from my account .
0	alpharooms are a scam beware !!
0	!
0	“ we received our new furniture today and are delighted with the product .
0	from initial order to a call from your team to confirm delivery dates to update texts to the final delivery , everything has_been of excellent service .
0	within the space of a week of ordering can '_t_believe we have the furniture already .
0	easy to unwrap and as already built everything was so easy !
0	can '_t thank_you enough .
0	great experience with oak_furniture_land .”
0	brought some of the supreme crest whitening strips from this website , i must_admit i was very skeptical and didn_'_t think they would really work !
0	i received my products the next_day , super_fast delivery !!
0	after just the first use i could see a huge_difference to my teeth !
0	and after a week the difference was absolutely astonishing !
0	i literally could not believe_how white my teeth were !!
0	i had strangers asking me how i got my teeth so white ( no exaggeration !!!)
0	my friend who has had her_teeth whitened at the dentist paid £_000 and didn_'_t get as good results as i did !
0	these strips are absolutely fantastic !
0	i did experience some slight sensitivity but nothing major and only lasted 0 day !
0	the customer support is amazing also and they reply to email very quickly !
0	defiantly recommend to everyone !
0	!
0	i like hostelbookers and would definitely recommend it .
0	it '_s easy to use and there are no booking_fees
0	i '_ve_used amazon for quite sometime_now and i '_ve never had a single problem with them .
0	top quality company .
0	really good anti_- virus software .
0	it dosen '_t constantly throw pop up messages at you and seems to get the job_done .
0	offer a good price and look very professional but don_'_t deliver , on any level and hold on to your money for as long as they can .
0	like many others have said this is also a us company not uk as they advertise .
0	wish i '_d of checked the reviews first !
0	placed my first order on the 00th of march at 00am and i received it at 00am the following_day .
0	couldn_'_t have asked for a better service and will defiantly be ordering from them again in the future .
0	if only all online_retailers were this effective .
0	hostelbookers will always be my " go - to " site when i feel my feet getting itchy and need to hit the road !
0	it '_s so easy to see all the information you need to make an informed_decision about the hostels , and the booking procedure is quick and easy with a very reasonable deposit rate of 00 %.
0	i '_ve been using hostelbookers for years and never once had a problem , i happily use this site and book with confidence every time .
0	excellent !
0	i used the live_chat option to resolve a query veronica was very quick , polite and patient and resolved my query .
0	from the moment we received our free sample we knew we had found the perfect invitations ; perfect quality , stunning design , perfect price and totally personal !
0	i would recommend on every level !
0	hopefully i will never use them again as i only want to marry once !
0	but would never hesitate to recommend !

0	well_worth_every_penny and more !
0	couldn_'_t be_happier !
0	thanks so much !
0	excellent price , excellent service and you deal with real people , would highly_recommend this company
0	i always use hostelbookers . com when booking a hostel .
0	i have never found a website with lower prices and better offers .
0	they don_'_t bombard you with emails , just important ones with great deals that any traveller would want to read !
0	the policies are fair and the company is very professional .
0	it is also easy to navigate the website and sort through preferences when searching for a place to stay .
0	it '_s a very trustworthy website and i would definitely recommend it to anyone - in fact , i always do !
0	goedkoop , mooie bril , hele goede service .
0	ben zeer_tevreden over smartbuyglass en heel erg goed geholpen door de medewerker ,
0	zeker een_aanrader ... n voor_de helft van_de prijs heb_ik tommy_hilfiger bril gekocht die_ik bij pearl zag .
0	found the products i wanted that i couldn_'_t find elsewhere .
0	easy to buy from and sent out quickly .
0	brilliant !
0	i enjoy buying from chemist_direct as the website is easy to use and they are always quick to despatch my items .
0	i receive emails to keep me up to date and the products always arrive safely_packaged and in good condition .
0	happy with all parts of order start to finish - price , delivery , timings and products .
0	thanks .
0	free delivery and competitive_prices - love it .
0	it would be great to have a larger and more diverse_range and choice of natural and new brands of cat foods , but they suit my needs right now which is perfect .
0	i buy small packs of applaws biscuits for my cat every now and then , and they ' re the cheapest around .
0	delivery takes about 0 - 0_days which is excellent .
0	hostelbookers . com is my go - to website for finding affordable lodging abroad .
0	thanks for providing the best places at the best prices !
0	i ordered from asda direct on 00th_nov , i received a email to say my product had been delayed but would be dispatched within 0 working_days and would be delivered 0 - 0 working_days .
0	i had no problem with this delay as i work in retail and completely understand the delays of christmas .
0	it got to the 00th_nov , still not product , i contacted asda direct .
0	who told me the delivery service yodel had attempted delivery to my property 0 times within the last_week now i know this was lies and i did say this to the customer service agent at asda , as my husband had been off on holiday all week .
0	after this challenge asda got back onto yodel who then said that because my property was a flat , they deemed they didn_'_t have full access to my property so couldn_'_t deliver ,
0	this was laughable considering royal_mail have no problem , parcel_force no problem but yet yodel couldn_'_t press a buzzer ( which is loud_enough to wake the dead ) to gain_access to the building .
0	so after being on the phone to a very helpful asda colleague him back and to between me and yodel , we arranged another deliver , the next_day again my husband was still off .
0	0pm came , and a yodel van was in my street i though brilliant they '_ve kept their_word ...
0	no they were delivery to a house 0 yards from our flats main_entrance .
0	the guy got back in his van and drove_off .
0	needless to say i got back onto asda and cancelled my order and will be getting a full_refund ,
0	i will never use any company that uses_yodel as a delivery service .
0	a bunch of liars not to be trusted !
0	this company is great , good value for money , fantastic customer service department delivery at various times days to suit all , very happy customer would definately use them again
0	i am already a regular_shopper at getbusy and love the products and the service .
0	my parcels are always delivered by next_day delivery with a text to say the exact time to expect them .
0	i would recommend getbusy to anyone !
0	great service - dispatch and delivery was super_fast .
0	after being let_down by another retailer who said they had the stock but did not i ordered my rab_jacket from webtogs and it arrived the next_day .
0	item arrived in a good delivery time and was exactly as i '_d ordered
0	do not use this service unless you enjoy being left endlessly on hold once your order fails to turn_up .
0	having ordered a bouquet for mother '_s day ( ironically at the recommendation of a banner advertising specifically mother '_s day services ) four days in_advance , i was surprised to learn that the next_day , my order hadn_'_t turned_up .
0	i emailed twice and received useless automated_responses and then decided to ring them .
0	i was on the phone to an unhelpful operator who specified a ' technical difficulty ' which had prevented the flowers from being delivered .
0	i quite reasonably requested a refund but again , my query had to be passed on to the ' customer service escalation manager '- who sends one automated email to confirm your phone_call and nothing more .
0	after three_days of no contact i decided to ring again to be told that a refund had been authorised - and yet i had not been notified of this .
0	no email with an_apology , no compensation , not even a lousy refund confirmation .
0	i wanted to show my appreciation on a public holiday for someone i care about - and the one service that they are supposed to provide apparently is beyond them .
0	terrible customer service , didn_'_t even notify_me that there was a problem with my order .
0	i cannot stress this enough , do not order from them .
0	popped_into park_cameras as wanted advice on a christmas gift & to check out prices .
0	all staff were extremely_helpful & not pushy to get a sale either .
0	will definitely return to make my purchase , as so refreshing to get such good service .
0	the payment came through quickly and was easy to post .
0	the price was better_than the competitor and so i '_m_glad i went with mazuma .
0	thanks mazuma :)
0	easy to use website , lots of payment options , had a problem with citylink but the other couriers cannot be_faulted , and the service fro parcel0go is outstanding they sorted my problem out really quickly
0	made my plans for travelling really straightforward and clear .
0	i '_m on a budget so it '_s great to have no booking_fees and it '_s easy to find the cheapest option .
0	will_continue to use the website for all my bookings over the next month .
0	quick and easy to order , easy to set out in lovely pots !
0	kids_loved the sweet buffet x
0	one whole month i had to wait for compensation payment for a parcel that parcel0go had lost .
0	the company does not have a direct telephone_number ( at_least not listed on the website ) so you have to either email or livechat .
0	many_times with the livechat i was sent away and told to wait with no direct answer .
0	the people ( i '_m guessing they were people on the other end ) were rude and not very helpful at all .
0	that was until today when ashley was able to sort_out my refund giving me a number of payment options .
0	he gave_me direct answer straight_away without making me wait .
0	although my experience with the company thus_far was awful i must_say ashley turned it around :) i would recomend the company as the prices are very good but i would suggest cover as parcels do get lost and you wont get the value of the products unless your covered .
0	all in all i see that there are some workers who literally carry the company .
0	hopefully all the hard_work will be noticed and due praise and promotion given .
0	thank_you ashley :)
0	somebody stolen my phone yesterday !
0	but i still have insurance till 00th_july_0000 !
0	and it '_s covered this trouble !!!!!!!!!!
0	but --- when i call to customer service t - mobile - they give me information that my insurance was canceled !!!
0	it '_s really bullshit - because i have the paper where i can see that it '_s still working !!!
0	insurance company don_'_t see my insurance at all !!!
0	the guys at the store also see my working insurance ( 0000 w atlantic blvd , margate , fl 00000 , 000 - 000 - 0000 )!
0	but nobody wants to help me - they tell me that it '_s my trouble and they don_'_t want to help me !!!!
0	someone on the line ( some manager ) told me - i can deleted your insurance and give you back 00 $!!!!!!!!!
0	are you serious ?!
0	give me back my money for the phone !!!!!!!!!!!
0	i really will go to court !!!!!!!!!
0	and they give me money for moral damage too !
0	i found artifolk by pure accident ordered arrived very quickly .. and have stayed with them .
0	i can buy elsewhere for less but why when the service is second to none and very quick with no_issues or delay .
0	perfect and well_worth_every_penny in my opinion .
0	i will only use them as i know i am getting the genuine product ( swann morton ) and not a cheap counter part .
0	thank_you and keep_up the brilliant work :)
0	marlow '_s was highly_recommended to me by a few friends so when i got engaged last summer there was nowhere to else to go .
0	an early start from somerset was definitely worth the effort .
0	we were served by margaret who was very informative , i had already researched the type of diamond that i wanted , and margaret listened_carefully to our requirements and then found us the perfect diamond that met all the requirements .
0	we then spent a while trying on the different_settings , before narrowing it down to two where margaret placed the diamond in the setting allowing me to make a decision .
0	within 0 hours my engagement_ring was ready for collection and was everything i had hoped for .
0	just under a year later we returned as it was time to purchase our_wedding_rings .
0	again the service we received from margaret was fantastic and we now have two wedding_rings which are exactly_what we wanted .
0	at the same time free of charge my engagement_ring was cleaned and serviced .
0	i cannot recommend marlow '_s highly_enough and i am absolutely_thrilled with all three of our purchases .
0	bought winter_tyres last winter great fast service !
0	will be back this year and the new site looks good to .
0	thanks sarah
0	the site was very user_friendly , i managed to find a voucher_code to give me 00_%_off my order , free delivery on top of this was a bonus and the item arrived very fast , before the expected date !
0	very happy as this was a present for my mum .
0	the site also has an amazing range of brands and products .
0	would recommend lookfantastic to anyone , and will definitely be returning soon !
0	very happy and satisfied_customer x
0	the easiest and quickest service i have ever used .
0	just like the advert_says , all you do is put it in the envelope and send it away , payment was recieved within 00_hours .
0	excellent .
0	p0g number : p0g - 00000000
0	i truly wonder_if the parcel0go service can get any worst ..
0	i paid them to deliver my laptop and it was subsequently lost , found and then returned to the me smashed , four_weeks after sending it and despite filing claims and numerous_emails today they sent me this :
0	' please_accept my apologies for the damages caused to your goods and any inconvenience this matter may have caused you thus_far .
0	my apologies again mr ******, i have credited you pre_- pay account with £_00 . 00 should you ever wish to allow us to restore faith '
0	so having returned a smashed laptop ( worth £_000 . 00 ) they credited my account with £_00 . 00 ; notwithstanding the fact that i have already paid them £ 0 . 00 for a failed delivery , so they actually credited me £_00 . 00 to spend with them .
0	the policy of parceltogo appears to treat the customer with utter contempt and an attitude that it ’_s not our fault so we couldn_'_t care less .
0	i have been insulted at every_stage by parcel0go and frankly the latest one of adding £_00 . 00 to a pre_- pay account is the final_straw , for the sake of good manners i won ’_t put into words what they can do with it !
0	original post 00 / 00 /_0000
0	almost four_weeks_ago i used parcel0go to send a laptop that didn_'_t arrive .
0	i was told by there staff to put in a claim after being told it was smashed in the warehouse and then being told it was lost .
0	so i filed a claim and after several weeks of going through a very difficult claims process it was finally accepted and i was offered a rather insulting £_00 . 00 despite proving the laptop was worth £_000 . 00 .
0	i wrote to parcel0go to say i was not happy with there £_00 . 00 offer which they ignored and then to my surprise the laptop was suddenly returned to me , smashed .
0	the box looked like it had been ran over and then someone wrapped lots of brown_tape around it .
0	i contacted parcel0go and was told to write to them and attach photos of the cardboard_box and packaging along with photos of my smashed laptop .
0	the laptop had been well_wrapped up in bubble_wrap and the cardboard_box was also well_packed with more bubble_wrap .
0	a week on and parcel0go have chosen to ignore my letter and emails , clearly in the hope i will just go away ..
0	so in short i used there service to send my laptop and four_weeks_later its returned to me smashed .
0	this was not what i paid them for and i feel very let_down and will never use there service again , a very unhappy customer .
0	beach club resorts give you the opportunity to stay in a wealth of fantastic resorts , providing first - class accommodation .
0	all of our resorts offer spacious , luxury self - catering apartments .
0	fab place my daughter always enjoys getting her shoes there and when i '_m son is old enough i will be taking him too . lol
0	love this site won loads of time '_s
0	sold heavy item on ebay so booked hermes through parceltogo . co . uk .
0	on there behalf it was a great service and was collected next_day and on time and tracked throughout .
0	however as soon as it was passed_onto hermes it seemed to all go_wrong .
0	buyer emailed saying the item was heavily damaged inside and they were very dissapointed as it was a present .
0	this item was in my family many_years and i am saddened to think it has_been so damaged because of carelessness of the courier company .
0	the buyer now at their own cost is having to repair the item .
0	very dissappointing service and at a cheap price i thought it was too good to be true !
0	and it was !!
0	:-(
0	i have been using hostelbookers for booking hostel since 0000 and everytime i found it very user - friendly and trustworthy to use its service : no extra_charge , reliable review and most_importantly , reasonable_price with good services provided by the hostels .
0	the user_interface is very user_friendly that i can find what i want easily .
0	sorting is easy , filter is easy -- everything is tailormade for users .
0	just one minor comment that i would like to make for improvement would be the function to find a particular hostel ( seems cannot do so right now to search a stay by name )
0	i have used groupon many_times and i have had a couple of issues .
0	their customer service is fantastic and resolve my issues within 00_hours unlike wowcher who i made the mistake of using once
0	brilliant service , fast delivery , easy website to use .
0	will definitely use again
0	booked a hotel in belfast for a overnight_stay and when i phoned the hotel that day to ask about parking they had no booking for us .
0	after 0 phonecalls made to alpharooms i was advised that we had been moved to another hotel without being told even_though i had already received the accomadation voucher for the original hotel .
0	they argued that they had upgraded us from 0_star to 0_star but this was not the point as i had booked the hotel initially because of its location we had to taxi to and from the alternative hotel and were separted from the rest of the party who were staying in our chosen hotel .
0	this is my 0nd disappointment with alpharooms and if you take my advice you wouldn_'_t touch them with a barge_pole , i was also out at_least £_00 on phonecalls .
0	recruit so simple is such a breath of fresh_air .
0	it '_s beautifully_designed , quick to use and it just makes_sense !
0	half of our office uses macs , and the other half uses windows and it '_s so nice to have a product that just works on everything .
0	when i '_m on the train i can access everything on my phone as well .
0	the support is also pretty impressive , especially when you get a reply within 0 minutes of asking your question .
0	i get the impression that they really do care about their customers .
0	i certainly won_'_t be going anywhere .
0	please do not use this company avoid_avoid_avoid !!
0	!
0	they delivered a damaged table back in august , with promises of delivering replacement_parts at the time , many phone_calls and email later at christmas we was told it was no_longer available and they would arrange a collection and refund , it is now the end of march and they are now trying to say that we have to return it ourselves , it is a joke of a company !
0	what company has a customer service department that you cannot_speak to !!!
0	they cannot tell me the reason_why i have to return it because the reason is they don not want to pay for the collection .
0	please stay well clear of this company !
0	!
0	they messed_up our transfers saying it was a computer error but had rebooked them once we got to the airport they could not find the new reservation of the transfers and was told by the desk to get a taxi and claim it back when we where back home .
0	on the return transfer we waited_until after 0pm to leave the hotel and again tried to claim back to claim back transfer , because they say they turned_up for the return transfer at 00 . 00pm and was told we was not ready but no one asked for us , they are refusing to help us return the loss for either transfer , we feel totally let_down by this company and would not recommend to anyone to use them and to avoid at all costs , go to a trusted website , this was extra money that we hadn_'_t budgeted on spending so affected the holiday .
0	avoid_avoid_avoid !
0	!
0	this shop is excellent value , order arrived very quickly and when i reported a shortage in my order they were very efficient and posted out missing items which arrived the following_day .
0	would recommend petsupermarket to any animal_owner
0	i would recommend healthysupplies to anyone .
0	the website was easy to use and delivery was very quick and well_packaged .
0	we had to order hinges for our fridge door .
0	these were dispatched very promptly and delivered when expected .
0	packaging was excellent and hinges arrived all intact .
0	no_complaints at all .
0	i was returning from holiday and my flight_landed too late for me to get back home .
0	i booked a double room for my partner and i in the travelodge near the airport .
0	on arriving i discovered it was a twin_room that was absolutely freezing and had no towels .
0	when i returned home i tried to contact travelodge and their is no way of calling them .
0	i emailed them and complained about the circumstances and got a very pompous reply telling_me i was mistaked , and that i booked a twin_room and if i wanted a towel i should have walked to reception to ask .
0	my partner did get a towel from reception as i had already jumped in the shower before i realised there was none .
0	even so i don_'_t feel i should have had to do this in the first place .
0	they did not mention the temperature of the room .
0	as i still had my booking confirmation which showed i booked a double room , i sent them a copy to which i had no reply .
0	i had to resort to sending them a letter which i got a reply and said pretty_much the same thing .
0	they obviously know people are not going to the effort of taking them to court for the sake of 00 pounds so just pawn you off until you stop contacting them .
0	will never stay in travelodge again and will tell others to do the same
0	bought some great shorts from asos .
0	delivered promptly with the promise of free_returns if unsuitable .
0	item was a great fit and a good match to the online picture .
0	bought a cake for my daughters_birthday and it was amazing !
0	it looked so good and everyone was very impressed .
0	tasted_delicious and lasted for ages .
0	would definitely recomend to others .
0	next are very reliable for deliveries .
0	they stock a wide_selection of high_quality goods and have no problem with returns and generally their employees are very friendly and helpful .
0	when i found flights to rome for 00 a head i thought it was a great deal .
0	with all the extra costs it ended_up being so much more .
0	also they have lowered their hand_luggage_allowance to 00kg and charge a whopping 00_quid for a 00_kg back for check in .
0	if you cantravel with just hand_luggage you do generally work out cheaper , but it '_s never as convenient and the airport is generally quite far away from its description
0	while the sellers themselves may be a bit_tricky sometimes .
0	ebay has a good system for it .
0	easy to use and trustworthy
0	ordered a pc from pc_world , paid for a specific delivery date .
0	( today from 0am until_0pm ) so they had a few_days to get it to me .
0	stayed in all day ( with an infant who was bored out of her mind ) and absolutely nothing .
0	i tracked it online and the last thing that came up at about 0 pm was that it was scanned as part of a secure process .
0	no phone_call , no delivery .
0	so at half seven i called them to see what was going on .
0	a very miserable woman told me that they weren_'_t delivering it today because it didn_'_t reach the depot until 0 .
0	i told her that is not my problem , i paid for a service and you are not providing it .
0	so she blamed pc_world for not getting it to aberdeen in time .
0	in reality it was yodel who transported the pc from hatfield to aberdeen so it was yodels fault .
0	not even a hint of an_apology .
0	just , " yeah but , yeah but " when you pay for something and they simply don_'_t do it and then have no reasonable explanation or apology or anything , speaking to their advisers is like speaking to a spoilt 0 year_old .
0	will not use yodel again under any circumstances and am severley p **** d off
0	zoomfish are fantastic !
0	they gave_me the best quote around for my ipad 0 (£_00 more than all other_companies i looked at !)
0	- they also gave_me extra money for liking them on facebook , bonus !
0	they are true to their_word , the payment was in my account the day my parcel was received and , something most companies seem to fail on , they sent me x0 different sized envelopes so i was able to return my ipad safely and securely in the box because i had a nice large envelope to put it in - the instructions were clear , the process couldn_'_t be simpler ...
0	i would recommend to anyone , in fact i already have done and i '_m foraging through my old gadgets to see what else i can recycle with them !
0	thank_you zoomfish !
0	from going in buying the couch with my partner and children , the lady in the shop made us feel extremely welcome .
0	no hard_sell , just friendly advice and good to have woman to woman opinion on colours , kids , wear and tear etc .
0	everything was clearly_explained , no_hidden_costs , kept us informed right up to delivery date .
0	the delivery service was excellent also , the lads where extremely_helpful and kind to my children who where very excited to see the new couch .
0	the whole_experience was just easy .
0	no_hassle at all and i would come_back for my couch year after year without a doubt .
0	they even forwarded some advice of how to get_rid of my old couch which was another stress took off my hands .
0	my couch is pride and place of my living_room and is of excellent quality and everything i wanted .
0	so thank_you dfs !
0	!
0	no_problems_whatsoever .
0	i ordered , paid same day , delivered 0_days_later .
0	no_issues whatsoever and have already planned my next purchase !
0	thank_you !
0	just wanted to share my brilliant experience with this company .
0	ordered online with ease , and found a chocolate wine ( i '_ve not seen in ages ) at the checkout .
0	delivery was next_day ( despite me only ordering the normal delivery option ).
0	the packaging was so secure that i think the box could have been run over ( agree a slight exaggeration !)
0	and the bottles would still be ok .
0	i will definitely be ordering again !
0	!
0	i '_ve paid for a wowcher to get hair_extensions from samereh hair but have been unable to get_hold of them ... they have ignored all my voicemails and their website is down and has_been for weeks now .
0	i '_ve contacted wowcher 0 times_now and they keep saying they can '_t put me through to customer_services but they will contact me as it '_s an_urgent matter ... 0_days_later i have still heard_nothing .
0	i have explained that i '_m getting_married in a few_weeks and ( as i have no address for the people doing my hair ) will now miss my appointment and my hair will not get done unless i find a new salon and pay full price which i can '_t afford .
0	i am_disgusted that wowcher for not dealing_with this properly and i am so frustrated that i have had to waste so much time sorting this out and seem to be getting_nowhere .... is it that hard for them to contact samerah ?
0	they are doing_business with them afterall ....
0	i was a bit_skeptical_about what the quality of the shoes would be like when i placed my order .
0	the pictures on the website looked good but i couldnt help but think that for just £ 0 they would look cheap .
0	i couldnt_believe it when they arrived .
0	they were nicely_boxed and placed in individual protective bags with spare heel caps .
0	the pictures didnt do the shoes justice as they looked much_nicer in real_life and looked much more_expensive .
0	i am very pleased with the service to as you were kept up to date with where your package was and when it would arrive .
0	i recieved my order 0_days after_placing my order .
0	will_definatley use again : )
0	bargain price and fast postage .
0	very pleased thankyou
0	their customer service is excellent and they were super helpful when i ordered the wrong_size of shoe .
0	they also had very , very speedy delivery !
0	i '_d had some diamond_earrings reset here around 0_months_ago , during which they '_d been really helpful with the new settings , what material was appropriate for the size of the diamonds etc .
0	my fiancé recently proposed with a plain placeholder ring , so i went on the alba_rose website and discovered their online interactive tool .
0	we then went to a store to look at the samples ring ( made up with cheap metal and cubic zirconia ).
0	i wanted a change made so my wedding_band would sit flush against my engagement_ring , so they sent the sample ring to their workshop so i could see the change i was requesting in real_life before we ordered .
0	they also ordered into the store various size / quality combinations of diamonds ( all a similar price ) to see which one we liked the best - we went into the store and they showed us how to properly look at a diamond under magnification - we went for smaller but better quality .
0	all of this was free of charge .
0	we then ordered the ring on a bespoke basis and they pushed it through quickly for me in just over a week .
0	i '_m so impressed with their service , their pricing is very reasonable comparatively as you ' re going directly to the manufacturer and the finished_product is beautiful .
0	i '_ve already_recommended them to a friend who wanted an_alternative quote for some pearl earrings she '_d seen in hatten garden , and they '_ve come in much more cheaply and are ordering her in different_types of pearls to choose from ( as they did with diamonds for my engagement_ring ).
0	i cannot recommend them highly_enough .
0	i purchased a my little pony t - shirt for a birthday_present and didn_'_t really want to pay the £ 0 . 00 for next_day delivery so i just opted for the normal first_class delivery .
0	omg !
0	i recieved the t - shirt the next_day !
0	i can '_t fault the guys at truffle_shuffle they did me proud and the gift reciever loved her t - shirt soooo_much .
0	it was well_packaged and of course i had fun nibbling the sweets that came with the item !
0	my family received nothing for christmas as a result of ordering from this company .
0	i '_m not someone_who can normally afford to buy flowers in any case , so when i discovered that my flowers had not been delivered and then found them uncontactable i was naturally very disappointed .
0	please do not use this company .
0	at_least my parents got to see a picture of what they would have looked like and appreciated the sentiment .
0	such a waste of money for effectively thin_air !
0	one word to describe your service …‘ awesome ’ discreet_packaging , a free gift , great products and fast delivery – i really couldn ’_t ask for more especially when buying intimate items .
0	i rang the customer helpline to ask for advice on an item and they were really helpful , polite and knowledgably .
0	i was updated_via_email with the status of my package from ‘ pending ’ to ‘ processing ’ to ‘ dispatched .’ i asked for next_day delivery and goods arrived the next_day in perfect_condition and were delivered by royal_mail .
0	when i opened the box i found everything had been wrapped up in the company ’_s tissue_paper and i was just so excited to get tearing into it to see what i would find first .
0	all the items arrived in good condition .
0	i received an_email two_days after my delivery stating i had £ 0 . 00 to spend in loyalty_points .
0	in a nutshell , great service and i look_forward to purchasing from your website again .
0	my boyfriend , kory , has always been a health buff so naturally i jumped on the band wagon .
0	i previously shopped at stores like gnc and vitamin shop , which were great but really hard to keep_up with the bills !
0	supplmentwarehouse . com encourages me to keep_up with my nutrition and health goals through discounted_prices .
0	balance is everything in both health and checkbooks .
0	i ordered a pair of guess prescription_sunglasses and was completely_satisfied with both the service and product .
0	ordering was straight_forward .
0	i would happily buy again .
0	great price , even better service . thanks
0	appalling - please do not use if you expect a collection .
0	drop_off may be reasonable but staying in for two 00hr windows is not acceptable .
0	thank_you cell0get for making this easy for me !
0	you were easy and very nice when i called .
0	i '_ll be telling my friends .
0	best company to buy lenses from - fast delivery and good prices .
0	i keep_coming_back to them when i need more .
0	fantastic service !!
0	!
0	sent phone in freepost_bag on sat 00th_june - money in bank on 00th !
0	!
0	thank_you !
0	order arrived in super quick time .
0	i have used medicanimal for over 0 years , having a dog with special_dietary_requirements .
0	initial problems with dented_tins has_been resolved .
0	dispatch is always timely and if i '_ve ever had need to phone through with a query , staff were helpful .
0	if you buy two of the same product you get 00_%_off the second item .
0	worth it if you have the space to store !
0	i could not be_happier with the service .
0	i browsed for possible christmas_presents and ended_up buying quite a bit .
0	the pricing was very good , ease to find things were very good , delivery timing was brilliant !
0	!
0	i have recommended to family and friends !
0	we ordered the janna invites and reply cards , and they were amazing .
0	the colours were exactly like you see on the computer_screen .
0	the whole site is classy and very easy to follow .
0	the way the prices are shown are easily to follow and makes_sense .
0	we booked this trip in january and a week before the trip my grandmother passed_away i dealt_with customer service who were understanding and attentive .
0	the trip went well and without issue everything went_smoothly .
0	would cerstianly use again and reccomend .
0	the money i was offered wasn_'_t great , i sold 00 cd '_s and got £_00 . 00 !!
0	it took well over a week after sending the items for them to be received and the cash to come through , the service was good but i doubt i would use the service again .
0	i understand it was my choice to sell the items but in honesty i couldn_'_t be bothered to sell the items individually but it worked out to £ 0 . 00 a cd roughly .... you know they '_ll be sold on for minimum of £ 0 . 00 each , great business .
0	i posted my old phone monday money in my bank_account tuesday_afternoon !
0	service !
2	well_done and many many_thanks .

2	i ordered flowers for my two sisters from seranata .

2	thank_you so much for looking after those treasured_memories and creating them so that my children can have copies .
2	absolutely top_class servicesbest regards

2	i just felt that i must contact you to congratulate you in the smooth effiecient way that your company has dealt_with my order .
2	right from_start to finish every_step has_been emailed to me .
2	i received an_email yesterday to say it would be here , another one this morning to say it would be here between 00 & 00 and it arrived at 00 . 00 - well_done .
2	in this day and age it is refreshing to see that you dont say any time between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 - who has time for that .
2	sent off my tapes on saturday00th december_0000 and received back friday 00st_december_0000 .
2	i didn_'_t expect to get them back until the new year as i had missed the last date for xmas orders .
2	surprised and delighted to receive my dvds back so quickly .
2	it was so lovely to see and hear my dad '_s voice who died recently once again and also of my father in law who passed_away 0 0 / 0 years_ago and seeing them with their grandchildren .
2	best christmas_present ever !!
2	i shall be sending off the next batch shortly !
2	ordered 0 pm and using at 00am the next_day ..... very impressive .
2	found site through search_engine but have saved as will definitely use again
2	ordered ink_cartridges the assistant was very helpful , they arrived next_day .
2	they had a promotion giving usb_sticks but i was unable to access claim_form ( my mistake ) but a quick email and i was sent the link again .
2	very impressed with service would definately use again .
2	needed a seatbelt for my daughter '_s wheelchair .
2	found complete_care shop via_google .
2	on line description very clear and price was competetiive with other_suppliers .
2	communication good throughout transaction and seat_belt now fitted and doing its job .
2	very satisfied overall
2	i have bought several items from woolovers now and am very happy with the quality as well as the range of styles and colours .
2	the prices are very reasonable too .
2	i would have no_hesitation in recommending the company to others .
2	i '_m so glad i '_ve found an excellent site to order really good , healthy food that you just can '_t buy easily in he high_st .
2	really wide_range of foods available at reasonable_prices with a no_quibble guarantee .
2	fast delivery & really good quality of goods .
2	very helpful customer service if any_problems & sorted_out immediatley .
2	would definitely recommend to people to use .
2	the quality of the t - shirt itself and the quality of the printing on it are both top_notch .
2	plus , even_though ordering the wrong_size was my error , it was replaced_immediately - what more could a girl want ?
2	!
2	i would definitely use tesco express again its always quick i never have to queue long .
2	i was trying to source some wedding_invites which had been_discontinued and eventually found them on this site .
2	the service was flawless with regular_updates on progress of order and info about other products i had enquired_about ,
2	i would not_hesitate to use this company in the future .
2	we surfed the net for hours , searching for the right matress at the right price .
2	after_reading_reviews from various_companies we found zleeps to be by far the best .
2	we were not disappointed with the company or the matress , the communication was excellent and our new matress arrived in under_00hrs .
2	the comfort of the matress we can not fault , it is by far , much_better_than our last memory_foam matress .
2	it is more comfortable and we do not get as hot .
2	we make excuses for an early night now , as the bed is so nice to sleep in .
2	i purchased a coffee and side table which took almost 0_weeks to be delivered although they took payment the minute the order was placed .
2	on receiving both of the above after numerous call re delivery i may add , i received the goods but minus several parts to build the coffee_table with .
2	i had to phone umpteen times only to be promised they would be sent out first_class_post the following_day but to no_avail .
2	i eventually gave up and threatened to cancel the order and request a refund and goods to be uplifted , only to be given another long_drawn_out story about short staff etc and the missing_parts would yet again be sent out first_class_post ..... guess_what they never arrived next_day but five days_later !
2	had i not been out of the country this company would have had a very nasty phone_call from me and a request to uplift their goods and refund my money .
2	i have spent extra pounds on the calls , let_alone the stress of not having the goods purchased , which i may add were not cheap .... did i receive any compensation or refund of delivery costs ?
2	no , a follow_up call to see if missing_parts had been received ?
2	no .
2	i purchase a lost of goods online and i must_say this is the worst customer service i have ever had .
2	i would stay clear of this company and will never use them again .
2	first_class service ..... fast and efficient from_start to finish
2	web shopping as it should be - easy !
2	thanks
2	i bought generic antihistamines and anti_- allergy nasal spray all at far less_than the branded items would have cost , they work just as well so why should i spend more ?
2	i also bought a few hair colours , not much_cheaper_than in the shops , but by spending over_£_00 altogether i got free_p_&_p .
2	they all arrived well_packed , in a sensibly sized box , within a couple of days of placing the order .
2	in january_0000 a bottle of tesco_finest fresh orange_juice exploded all over my kitchen within an_hour of buying it splattering the ceiling , walls , units and pile of ironing with orange_juice .
2	i claimed against tesco for redecorating and produced the offending bottle .
2	another new bottle of which the cap was also at great risk of exploding .
2	a set of photographs showing damage_caused and a decorators quote for £_000 .
2	on the 00th_october_0000 tesco admitted liability stating the £_000 would be in my account within ten days .
2	by the 00th_december_0000 it still had not been paid and tesco continued to say - the payment is still being_processed .
2	which year are they actually intending to pay the debt they owe me ?
2	har brukt dette nettstedet mye .

2	this is really what i want from a company selling airtickets online
2	i took delivery last friday of furniture i ordered from oak_furniture_land .
2	the 0 delivery guys , [_name_] and [_name_] were absolutely amazing and a credit not only to your company but to the human race !
2	they were the most helpful and understanding guys and tried ( and succeeded ) with different options to enable the wardrobe to get upstairs .
2	i have to say what actually happened was above and beyond the call of duty !
2	i would like to say a massive thank_you again to these 0 and if you do an employee of the month they both deserve it hands_down .
2	i ordered the tokyo_range last month , very pleased with the quality despite the dressing_table having a damaged drawer , the way the problem was resolved was very impressive ( replacement item received 0_days after calling !)
2	due to the customer service and overall quality i then ordered furniture for another 0 rooms , from the alto and bevel ranges .
2	one chest had a bit of damage to it which has just been reported , so hopefully this will be resolved quickly and effeciently as was the previous occasion .
2	imperfections and problems happen but it is the way they are dealt_with , up until now i cannot_fault ofl for their customer service .
2	i was unable to check the items within the specified timescale , i contacted them and i was quite happily given a few extra days .
2	keep_up the good work .
2	kind_regards , rebecca turner .
2	hi , i don_'_t normally fill in these things but the quality of the trousers and the fast delivery along with a good returns system , not that i needed it , made me think it was worth the comment !
2	i recommend s . a . a .
2	to help and encourage you to continue as an artist .
2	if it wasn_'_t for the s . a . a i would not be working as a professional artist today .
2	i use the s . a . a .
2	for all my art_supplies , love reading the paint every_month , participate in comps / aticles etc .
2	the best around .
2	having had a problem or 0 with parcel collection ( none of which was parcel0go '_s fault ) the on - line chat help facility was just great at sorting it all out .
2	fingers_crossed for a successful collection tomorrow and many_thanks to andrea for patience and speed in getting things sorted for me .
2	viovet made ordering easy .
2	information was clear and informative .
2	i made my order on - line , posted my prescription and my order arrived two_days_later first_class_post ( the day after viovet received my order ).
2	as a breeder of british shorthair cats , a good price is important to me , i had scoured the internet for the cheapest price and viovet won hands_down .
2	needless to say i have told my kitten owners about viovet .
2	i found holidays_please by_chance and was so glad i did .
2	amanda slade asked all the relevant_questions and she found us the perfect holiday in thailand .
2	it was for a special birthday and she even arranged for a bottle of bubbly to be sent to our room .
2	nothing was too much_trouble for amanda and she kept us up to date by email and phone before we left and called again when we got home , to ask about our holiday .
2	i would certainly recommend and use holidays_please again .
2	great communication & speedy delivery .
2	no_problems at all .
2	i am planning a once in a lifetime_trip .
2	to make the most of my stay , i not only need good information , but a trust_worthy place to get that information .

2	it works for me .
2	i hope elvis is still in the building !

2	my english_springer_spaniel bitch struggled with growing feathering and when i spoke to the staff on the yumega stall at lka last_year , they suggested i tried yumega_plus .
2	i took them up on their advice and went on to win 0 rcc , 0 cc and a bob this year and all at the age of 0 years old .
2	her beautiful condition i believe is thanks to daily use of yumega_plus .
2	i have since put my cockers and sussex and can_rely_on prompt delivery every time .
2	recently had annual servicing on boiler , the engineer was excellent i have had homecare 000 for many_years had to have some new parts due to faults found but it is now running smoothly parts had to be ordered and the engineer was back early next_morning to do it , all went well so thankyou for getting my ageing boiler back to good working order .
2	i recently used p0g for the first time having used other courier services in the past .
2	i found the website easy to use and the cost of delivery was very reasonable .
2	collection and delivery were made on time and customer service was excellent .
2	i will certainly be using p0g again and would recommend to other_companies .
2	we have been using viovet since 0000 for a special_diet for our dog .

2	easy website , faultless service , quality products and good prices - very highly_recommended !

2	i have purchased a number of items from this site would recommend it highly the prices and quality are brilliantly
2	this is by far my favourite on line shop i buy something at_least once a week leaving my so broke cant resist a bargain
2	i am so glad i found this online shop its so handy and speedy delivery i will deffo be using it in future .
2	i had been buying special flea / worming_treatment for my 0 cats from my vet which cost me a small_fortune .
2	a work_colleague put me on to viovet where i learned that i could request a prescription from my vet and then purchase this medication on line with viovet ( my vet obviously didn_'_t tell me that i could get this treatment elsewhere and a lot_cheaper ).
2	i downloaded the prescription onto the viovet website and ordered the medication at about a third of the price i was paying the vet and hey_presto !
2	the next_day i received my order .
2	i won_'_t be going anywhere_else now for any medication .
2	thankyou viovet for your excellent and speedy service .
2	i am absolutely_delighted with the service and quality of my furniture i have received from oakfurnitureland .
2	they stay in contact with you up until the minute it is delivered by phone email and text also calling you when they are half an_hour away ........ just brilliant so keep_up the good work .
2	also the furniture looks fabulous in my new home .

2	i am always very happy with serenata .
2	the flowers of high_quality and you are always kept_informed of progress in a courteous and friendly_manner .
2	i was most impressed with appliances_online , from their competitive_prices to their very user_friendly site .
2	payment and delivery details provided were excellent .
2	communication to ensure we were available on the day was top_notch , as was the eco reminder of days delivering to our area .
2	i was also impressed by the friendly and efficient service of expert logistics , the courier company who were cheerful and provided an excellent service .
2	would not_hesitate to use appliances_online again , or to recommend them to family and friends
2	pj my cat is a health happy cat thanks to petfleas prices , half the price i would normally pay at the vets ,
2	i purchased an heru kettle , something a bit different from the norm .. it came a day earlier_than_expected , and i love it .
2	thankyou hifi - tower .
2	my order was delivered with drooping flowers , buds that were going brown and a pathetic number of flowers that were bulked out with loads of branches .
2	if you dare to complain , they won_'_t_believe you unless you email photos as proof .
2	unfortunately my 00 year_old mother is not tech - savvy so customer ' service ' refused to take any further_action .
2	do yourself a favour and order elsewhere .
2	this was agreat experience , much_better_than speaking on the phone , you feel like you are talking to someone_who is there in the room .
2	daniel , the customer service guy , was very efficient and friendly .
2	thanks daniel for a speedy answer to my query .
2	way back in early march i ordered a piece of furniture .
2	after two promised attempts of delivery the furniture did not arrive .
2	after several appalling attempts of apologies i gave up and cancelled my order .
2	achica owe me £_000 which i still have not received .
2	if you want to be robbed , misery and grief , then go_ahead and use this atrocious attempt of a company .
2	i am unable to give a positive_review as i feel let_down and very disappointed .
2	upon placing my order i was informed that it would be unavailable for dispatch for two months , this was undesirable but agreeable and expected before christmas .
2	it was only a month and a half later that i was then informed that it would not be delivered before the new year in the middle of january .
2	this has put me in a predicament , which could of been avoided if levels of organisation and customer_care within the cotsworld company were at a satisfactory level ; in this time i could have had the product designed and built from scratch .
2	needless to say i would advise others to take their delivery estimates with a pinch of salt .
2	from_start of order to recieving goods was an excellent world class service provided .
2	super_fast delivery , high_standard of goods .
2	ordered many personalised shirts , jumpers , tracksuits for my football_team .

2	“ being in the middle of a massive renovation_project we have bought many things online , and i feel it only fair to say oakfurnitureland excelled in every_aspect .
2	from_start to finish we were kept_informed of progress and the sideboard when it arrived was in perfect_condition and superb value for money .
2	we will certainly look on their site first in future , it '_s rare to get such good customer service ...
2	very easy to order and find what you are looking for , good prices and delivery service and keep you up dated about your order .
2	as above your service was extreemly good would recommend to anyone
2	i can '_t tell you how the holiday was , as we haven_'_t been yet .
2	i can only comment how easy it was to make the booking .
2	kevin was very helpful , without being " pushy ".
2	i changed my mind several_times , i wanted new_york plus the caribbean . every time i changed what i wanted , he came up with ideas .
2	he has given sensible advice and contacts re .
2	visas .
2	now all we have to do is wait for the holiday .
2	i '_ll let you know how it goes when we get back !!
2	!
2	i '_ve never had a dish that i could use on the hob , then put in the oven .

2	will i use serenta again ?
2	absolutely !
2	and i '_ll be recommending them to friends .
2	i have used healthspan for years and have never found them wanting .
2	would highly_recommend on both price and service .
2	due to the discounted_price this was a good deal and their free delivery charge for my spending over_£_00 meant that i was happy to buy from them as_opposed to buying from a store like b_& q .
2	great communication every_step of the way and i was delighted with the product when i used it .
2	i '_d never had a new_kitchen before and so this was a real_treat for me and one that i didn_'_t want to be ruined by a bad_experience .
2	my parents had recently used wren to install their new_kitchen and they had been so pleased with the full service that it just seemed sensible for me to start my search there ..... and that '_s as far as i got !
2	i was delighted with the level of service from the staff .
2	both in person and on the phone .
2	no matter_how often i rang to change something or raise a query , i never got the impression that i was being a pain , ( although i '_m_sure i was !!).
2	the lengths that the team went to in order to ensure customer_satisfaction meant that i remained confident in the co . throughout the process .
2	the quality of the product was commented on by my fitter and my finished kitchen looks very impressive and has had many admirers after showing a work_colleague , he too placed an order with wren_kitchens .
2	i can '_t recommend wren_kitchens enough and i am so grateful that i sourced them to supply my new_kitchen .
2	great prices
2	i went into the guildford store and ordered a 0_seater_sofa and 0 armchairs in early november .
2	the product i wanted was not available from the warehouse so i was informed i would have to wait_until the next delivery from the manufacturer in december .
2	on the due date i was contacted by phone for them to arrange delivery .
2	this was agreed and the delivery arrived at 0 . 00 am as agreed .
2	the delivery men took all the packaging away with them and i was totally happy with my new furniture and the service i had received .
2	this is the second time in 0_months i have used furniture_village and am totally_satisfied with products and service .

2	i ordered 0 canvases for gifts as have used orbit before and have always been happy with my purchases .
2	i requested the delivery for the following_tuesday .
2	when the goods did not arrive i contacted orbit , who contacted yodel , who informed the goods had been delivered . this was not the case !!
2	orbit agreed to reprint for me .
2	even_though delivery was a little later than than_expected i have now received my 0 canvases and once again am extremely happy the goods .
2	they are great value for money and excellent quality .
2	would recommend to anyone .
2	keep_up the good customer service !
2	!
2	first time used site very pleased quick delivery .
2	thank_you
2	ok if you haven_'_t got the idea by now , do not use ecar !!
2	unfortunately i didn_'_t have the foresight of these reviews !!
2	to cut a long_story_short , i took out a policy with them , within about 0_weeks of starting the policy we too got bombarded to submit proof , which was done by email and confirmed at the start of the policy !
2	then they decided to put the price up , by £_000 !!!
2	at the time i did not have enough money to chance insurance providers so had to continue with the monthly_payments which started at around £_00 , later rising to £_00 . 00 , then we were told that we would be getting a refund taking the monthly_payments down to £_00 then another letter to say no , sorry , your monthly_payments will remain £_00 . 00 .
2	ok so grumble grumble we carried on paying .
2	then when we moved to a better area , with driveway , cul - de - sac etc i contacted ecar to change the details ( needless to say i haven_'_t rung them once as their call charges are just unrealistic !)
2	you can do changes online and it gives you a quote .. so proceeded to do this , to find out that an additional £_000 would be required to make the change !!
2	( not including the standard £_00 odd change to policy fee ) so i decided to get quotes from elsewhere .
2	having done this i found a quote for £_00 per_month !!
2	i therefore cancelled my policy but of course the online quotation wouldn_'_t say if i would be owed or if i would owe money .
2	however , having paid the monthly premium on 00th_october and being a months payment in_advance and my policy ending on the 00th_october i presumed ( stupidly ) that i would be getting money back from them and the premium would cover the £_00 cancellation_fee .... ooo no .. like getting blood from a stone !!
2	i '_ve now received a letter saying i owe them £_00 . 00 and to call their £ 0 . 00 per min number to make payment !!!!
2	absolutely fuming ..... needless to say i am now going through all the paperwork and will be making a complaint to trading_standards or the motor ombudsman ( if there is one !!)
2	absolutely atrocious !
2	also non of my correspondence has ever had a reasonable reply , only directed me to their website !
2	when my change of details quotation was received i sent an_email to their customer_services and was directed to their website , no help what so ever as it would have required someone to talk to me and go through the file to resolve the issue !
2	!
2	this is the second time using medicanimal .
2	will be using again in the future
2	being a londoner , i went on line to find a florist in kingsbridge , south devon .
2	i didn_'_t want to pay the exorbitant fees charged by " interflora " and the like .
2	i sound the serenata site ... hey_presto !
2	really lovely flowers , guaranteed next_day delivery and hugely competitive_rates .
2	the friend who was the recipient was thrilled to bits with the bouquet … and she skyped me so that i could see how fabulous it was .
2	the only sad thing was not being_able to access the fragrance …. technology can only do so much !
2	i will certainly use the serenata site again .
2	my son is a keen snowboarder but i know very little yet i always feel like a valued_customer and no stupid_question is ever too stupid .
2	love these_guys and would definitely recommend
2	if you want to sent flowers to anyone , the service was first_class , and the flowers were lovely .
2	highly_recommended .
2	the product has yet to be tried out in snow so i am giving 0_stars for the attention i received from the company .
2	i needed to have the package re - sent and to cut a long_story_short - received it just 0 hours after i emailed my request ... quick service indeed - which put a smile on my face .
2	thank_you
2	i was told by someone_else that yodel were not very good so have used another courior service in the past but this return to amazon had to be done by yodel i am now so pleased that it did i am astounded the parcel left here in plymouth around 00_noon on thursday the 0th of feb and was delivered today in edinburgh 0th_feb at 00 . 00am what an amazing service , for future parcels to my daughter i will go through yodel .
2	i always get my printer_cartridges from printer_basics always here quickly and never any_problems reasonably_priced too .
2	it did what it said on the tin !
2	well_packaged , speedy delivery ... marvellous ...
2	i '_m just about to go to the site to make another purchase ... thanks
2	varied_selection of goods at attractive prices makes wowcher really worth looking at every day .
2	i have to wear compression socks following two superficial dvt '_s ..... the patterned socks are such a brilliant change from black / neutral !!!
2	!
2	they are very comfortable , a good size and keep their shape when washed ............ add this to an excellent price & delivery service .......... you have it all !
2	!
2	total con .
2	waited months for orders to arrive ............ when one did was awful ....... sent the bag back ............ no refund .
2	still_waiting for refund and second order ........ what compounds the issue is i paid nellypot p_&_p and extra £ 0 for what i '_d thought would be a lovely bag !!
2	! they were having a laugh and this has made me much wary of buying kgb & groupon deals
2	i used the free to landlords service and found it effective and really efficient .
2	it saved me so much_trouble and new tenants were found and credit checked within 00 days .
2	at all times the staff were incredibly helpful and courteous .
2	i will definitely use them again
2	ordered a tumble_dryer and was kept_informed all the way of when it would be arriving .
2	cannot_fault the service i received whatsoever ...
2	i will be ordering a washing_machine and hopefully a chest_freezer from here as well within the next 0_weeks .. did alot of research prior to ordering and found appliancesonline to be the best by far on price and delivery .
2	easy to fill out prescription details .
2	very good , prompt service
2	i would say the service is excellent , in speed & applying the credit .
2	although the networks can be far from acceptable , i have had many wasted calls whereby repeat calls have been necessary to achieve a decent conversation .
2	( i . e loss of speech / crossed lines , interference etc : at times the calls just cut of randomly .
2	on other occasions i have connected to the same number i always ring 0000000 ** 00 ** 0 , & an auto attendant then some prostitute chat line on many occasions telling_me what bikini she had on , & what she was prepared to do to me ..!!?!
2	numerous_attempts later & lost credit & finally reaching my dialled destination .
2	i intend to try elsewhere .
2	these magnets are scarily strong !
2	really quick delivery
2	david in sales was very helpful and patient with my ( user error ) logging on problem !
2	villa_plus was recommended to us by a friend and it was the best holiday we have ever had .
2	the villa was beyond our expectatations .
2	the villa we had in nerja had everything you could_possibly_need .
2	the villa_plus representative called on us to see how we were getting on and to check that everything was to our satisfaction .
2	~ we enjoyed this holiday so much we have already booked to return to the same villa for two_weeks next year .
2	i would defintately recommend villa_plus to anyone
2	i found exactly_what i wanted on this site , ordering was easy and straight_forward , delivery was very quick .
2	a first_class operation .
2	i was very pleased .
2	shakes are better_than a year_ago and the introduction of the coffee essences makes my first choice of vanilla really pleasant and filling .... the bars are also pleasant though a bit dry ... need to drink with them as it fills you up more .... the porridge is nice and a good breakfast or evening choice .... am on my second round of dieting and will approach it differently this time ... use the products to help me even_though the weight_loss is over to maintain my correct weight ... 000_% to start then introduce a little low_cal .
2	food and gradually get back to eating well and not overeating ... a good diet ....

2	took less_than 0_weeks to del .
2	good customer service ... 0 man del ... very good what more can i say prices excellent ...
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending stone_bridge hair_accessories .
2	they are of a quality you can '_t seem to buy / find on the hight_street .
2	it was really easy to order and the wallpaper arrived very quickly and via_dpd which works really well as you can alter the delivery date if you know you won_'_t be in and you also get a 0 hour time_slot so no hanging_around all day .
2	i ordered my rayban_sunglasses through fashioneyewear and received first_class service , they use dpd to deliver , i was able to change the delivery date to the following week as i was going to be away at short_notice and you are given a 0 hour time_slot which they kept to .
2	i knew the glasses i was purchasing as they were a replacement for a much loved pair .
2	i would certainly order from them again .
2	very reliable service - phone_call to arrange convenient date - phone_call on the day to give time - arrive on time with friendly driver - what more could you ask for ?
2	thank_you xdp !
2	0nd order !
2	both have been extremely good and we have happily recommended you .

2	i also discussed my order with jacqui as i was unsure_whether or not i needed one of the parts that i had ordered .
2	jacqui was kind enough to look into the matter for me and removed the item from my order and issued an_immediate_refund - thank_you jacqui .
2	as to the door_handles ordered , i am very pleased with them , however , they will not be fitted until i receive my new door , near to the end of march .
2	firstly the " returns service " via named shops - none of the shops the parcel was taken to knew anything about the returns services !
2	one of the shops didn_'_t even exist .
2	then went on to return part of my order via_royal_mail , which cloggs are denying having received .
2	will never use this company again !
2	i had doubts that i woukd receuve my tickets but sure eniugh we got them had a fab time and will defi use this company at all times .
2	i phoned and left my number within in 0 mins my call was returned and i booked both of my vechiles from a very friendly and polite gentleman , he explained_everything to me , would use again as i travel to florida every year and will be recommeding to friends and family , my experience excellent company .
2	i '_m extremely upset about the mother '_s day bouquet that was delivered to my elderly_mother 0_days before mothers_day .. not on the day as i had requested ..... the bouquet was a disgrace ... looked like it had been thrown together .
2	in less_than 00_hours many of the flowers had died although it had been kept in perfect conditions .... i emailed iflorist twice ... no answer ... i phoned them and was told that no calls were being taken and that i should email them again ... which i did ... no answer .. i tried to live_chat with them .. no answer .
2	what do i do now .
2	this is probably the worst service that i had ever received from any company .
2	be warned unlimited data usage at home is not applied to europe .
2	just received 000 . 00 in data roaming charges , as a gesture of good will vf said they would refund 00_%, which i was not happy with .
2	i now read on watchdog and eu websites that there is a 00 euro monthly cap on data roaming charges .
2	are vf contravening my human rights ?
2	so i have made 0 complaints via phone and internet chat and now an_email .
2	the best company in every way .
2	been buying from them for over 0 decades .
2	they have top quality innovative products at best value for money when comparing the details of ingredients & also excellent customer service .
2	the discounts for members are well_worth the small annual_fee .
2	the monthly sale items can work out at 00_%_off .
2	i '_ve been ordering co q 00 and 0htp from just vitamins for a few_years , am always very pleased with the quality / effectiveness of these products , speed of delivery , and any after sales service .
2	their help on the telephone was really good , finding out what i needed to know and calling back propmtly with the information before i bought the item .
2	they delivered within 00_hours as promised .
2	you can '_t ask for more than that .
2	service available .
2	the price was outstanding - i priced the same article locally ( a hotpoint washer_dryer ) and marks_electrical saved me £_000 !
2	amazing !
2	the two lads who delivered ( matt & jordan ) the washer were great .
2	i would highly_recommend the company and will definitely use them again in the future .
2	thanks .
2	i had no problem finding what i needed .
2	transaction and delivery were excellent .
2	thank_you ♡♡♡
2	i can only say good things .
2	secretsales were efficient , helpful , friendly and cooperative .
2	i '_m really happy with the service and would highly_recommend them .
2	they kept me up to date all the time .
2	thank_you and wishing you all a happy and successful new year .
2	after having a very early ( aged_00 ) menopause i was prescribed hrt which i took for over almost 00 years . my gp advised i should stop taking the hrt last_year as it isn_'_t healthy to be on them for over 00 years .
2	after 0_weeks " they came "........( the dreaded hot_flushes ) and they got worse and worse until i was having in excess of 00 every day and at_least 00 during the night ...... waking_up every time ..... i returned to my gp and said i couldn_'_t cope with " them " she advised i just need to put up with it ... that '_s life !!!!!!!
2	well my life might as well of been over .... i have a very busy_life with 0 teenage_children at home and i work full time in social care with families and children , completing assessments , attending meetings , delivering parenting programmes etc etc , all very social stuff ... but " those things " were making my life unbearable .
2	in desperation i searched the net for something that may help , i wasn_'_t really very hopeful that anything that wasn_'_t on prescription would be of any use to me ... i was desperate , really desperate ..... i came_across simply_suppliments who advised that " menapol_plus " may help and they had an offer on so i decided to give them a try . my order arrived very quickly and i started_taking menapol_plus about 0_weeks_ago .
2	i think i was probably hoping for a fast fix and initially was dissapointed that this didn_'_t happen overnight however i had nothing to loose so continued with 0 every day ( one each morning and one each night ) and after a few_weeks they started working ...... i didn_'_t notice it at first but then started monitoring how many_times " they came " today i probably have only between 0 and 0 during the day and probably 0 - 0 each night , this is a vast_improvement on my original state and a massive_improvement on my quality of life ....
2	i can not thank simply_supplements enough ... i have my life back now
2	my latest booking was looking good and went through without a hitch until i realised that i had overlooked the small_print that the ' shared bathroom ' was down stairs .
2	it was goiong to be risky for my elderly_mother to get up at night and make her way downstairs to use the bathroom so i sent in a query .
2	sadly there were no other rooms available but i was able to cancel the booking without a fee and i have now made a new booking and all is looking good again .
2	i think the true proof of good service is when something_goes_wrong and you are given the support you need to sort it out the best way possible .
2	thank_you , margaret
2	best prices for carrie elspeth jewellery and great choice .
2	delivery was swift , so overall very pleased and will use again .
2	cheaper_than the shops and arrived really quickly , no_complaints .
2	i ordered 0 items , signed for the delivery , but when opened the box only 0 item , nothing about other item , packing_slip - didnt get one .
2	awaiting a reply fr om them :(
2	went to the site as recommended by a friend , found a great range of dog_treats for my dog , he fed_up with the treats i buy from the supermarket , so decided to try something different .
2	a +
2	my daughter recommended the web_site as she had bought some items from them .
2	i found the web_site easy to use and thought the selection of gifts and their prices were very competitive .
2	it was easy to fill my basket with lots of goodies .
2	they arrived quickly and expertly_packaged .
2	one item was found to be faulty but this was not an issue as a replacement was despatched_immediately along with a return postage_label .
2	i will definitely be recommending them to friends and have already ordered for a second time myself .
2	what a great way to start our holiday .
2	the comfort of the rooms was amazing and even_though a stones_throw from the airport did not hear a thing !
2	friendly staff and leaving the car during our holiday made it nice and easy - all booked in one go !
2	i have dealt_with parcel0go on a couple of occasions and always found them to be a reliable and trustworthy company
2	the time and money they save is also a reason to keep_coming_back
2	thanks
2	right from the start the process was easy and straight_forward .
2	the quotes given were fair and informative .
2	i was kept in the loop right through the process and it was completed within 0_weeks ..
2	rang through on sunday_evening at 0 : 00 to ask if i place an order for a new oven would it be delivered before christmas no problem they said no delivery charge , so placed the order very sceptical that it would arrive but monday_evening received a text to say it would be with us on christmas_eve between 0 - 0 am , christmas_eve morning at 0 : 00 we received a call to say they would be with us in 00_mins and they were , so they saved our christmas_dinner thank_you a o online for your friendly and speedy service .
2	we are extremely pleased with the tv_unit and chest of drawers we have recently_purchased .
2	lucky_enough to choose directly from the shop , the customer service has_been first_class .
2	so welcoming , friendly and with no_pressure , made shopping a real_pleasure .
2	great value too .
2	the same products from a national company are much more_expensive .
2	although we have yet to put the ramp to use , we are delighted with the build quality .
2	the ease of ordering and speed of delivery was also impressive and we will recommend you to others when we have the opportunity .
2	many_thanks
2	excellent service no_complaints whatsoever .
2	i would recommend to friends & family
2	delivered very quickly ..
2	we had a good holiday with loveholidays . com , we will be using them again in the future .
2	the fact that you can pay monthly helps too & low_deposit all helps spread the cost & make holiday more affordable .
2	fantastic service , my goods arrived within a few_days of ordering , & free_postage really encourages customers to use the website , will be using pet_supermarket again .
2	flowers arrived at a good time
2	beautiful blooms
2	will use serenta again and spread the word
2	" what a discovery , i have been interested in buying a silk duvet for a couple of years .
2	now this silk duvet ticks_all the boxes for us .
2	it is light , it drapes , and is warm .
2	i think even on the coldest nights we may not need any more covers on our bed . "
2	i have used parcels0go to send several parcels out using yodel and even_though using the yodel 00 hour service so far 00_% of parcels were delivered to customers the next_day .
2	on one occasion the courier failed to collect , and i used the live_chat and william quickly rebooked the collection for the following_day for me .
2	looking for a decent pension_provider can be very stressful - or so i understand .
2	age_partnership took care of all of the stress for me and omar mesbahi handled everything in a most professional way : always helpful and polite , but very friendly .
2	apart_from getting me a good deal on the limited_funds i had , he always contacted me when he said he would and provided all the information .
2	his knowledge of the market was admirable and he was always able to explain the facts clearly .
2	many_thanks .
2	customer ref_000000
2	service very good and prompt , however after purchasing over_£_000 of balloons / goods and whilst awaiting the helium ( one week before the party ) only to be phoned to say that there is a shortage of helium and consequently my order could not be fulfilled .
2	the first enquiry to a googled helium supplier and my request for helium from a competitor was met , they had not heard of said shortage !
2	very happy that i was let_down in time so that i could purchase the gas from elsewhere .
2	apart_from the helium incident very good service , nice website and helpful staff .
2	love the service love the cloths shoes bags hats and so on so much .
2	everything i have got i have loved .
2	cloths wash and wash , 0 of the pairs of boots i wore all winter in the snow they were great .
2	i only have 0 problem i can '_t stop spending on this site lol
2	great service good price
2	we did lots of research to see what pram would be best for my daughter who is expecting twins .
2	once you have decided on the make model and colour , you then find the best price .
2	that is what pointed us in the direction of bambino_direct .
2	not only were they absolutely the most competitive but they offered very quick delivery .
2	i have never before been advised at so many stages that our delivery was on the way - and this was really useful .
2	we knew the day , and the approximate_time_span , and then we were told it would be with us in an_hour - so the whole day was not wasted waiting for a delivery that didn_'_t arrive when expected .
2	great service , i really mean that .
2	we are so delighted , just waiting for those babies to come along now .
2	that is not quite the sure thing of a bambino_direct delivery !
2	quick delivery , well_packaged , well priced tape .
2	just what i need .
2	this tape will get my family_members on the go in double quick time .
2	good service at a low price
2	sent in phones and money was transferred within 0_days !
2	i would not_hesitate to to recommmend this services to my friends
2	and an extra big thank_you to your assistant [_name_] who was amazing arranging everything for me even a pick_up from my work place ..... thank_you [_name_] once again :)
2	i really could not recommend this company enough from the easy use website to speedy delivery and the flowers were to die for
2	i honestly cant thank them enough
2	please keep_up the good work
2	no_hesitation on recommending them watsoever

2	i ordered the gear0music '_s own digital_piano ( sp0000 ) which i ordered at 0 . 00pm and it arrived at 00 . 00am the next_morning - wow !
2	i worked for 00 years as a prof accompanist and wanted a cheap replacement for a portable keyboard which had died .
2	this is simply brilliant value for money - a full piano keyboard with all the basic things that you need ( transpose , varied touch response , etc ) for a keyboard price .
2	there '_s nothing else on the market to compare to this deal - brilliant idea by gear0music to produce this option .
2	gear0music are 000_% reliable ( have used them loads over the years ) and would recommend this piano and company to anyone .
2	phoned mazuma monday to clarify the condition of two of the three handsets and spoke to a very helpful lady .
2	processed request online that same day for a prepaid_envelope , which arrived tuesday , posted handsets off wednesday and payment was in my bank_account thursday ( today ).
2	can '_t complain_about next_day service !
2	i looked at other recycling_sites but they seem to want to pay second_hand prices but want pristine_condition phones .
2	highly_recommend mazuma and would definitely use them again :-_d
2	great , competitive_pricing !
2	beats amazon in pricing & shipping speed !
2	amazing !
2	!
2	sammie_taylor answered my request very quickly and efficiently .
2	needed to change collection location at the last_minute .
2	christmas_gifts for my granddaughters in france .
2	thought i had missed the boat to get them there for christmas , but hopefully now , santa from walsall will make it in time .
2	thanks sammie .
2	time from order to delivery was less_than 00_hours ( at no extra_cost ).
2	ordered cat_food which was out of stock everywhere_else .
2	called and spoke with a lovely lady_who took my order and when i explained the urgency she had it dispatched the same day .
2	received food the next_day .
2	fabulous service .
2	i would highly_recommend them
2	a special brandy not found in the uk or france , no problem with " the drink_shop ", easy ordering , good service , delivered what ever date is needed .
2	brilliant service .
2	i am most impressed with the level of service provided to sellers .
2	this was my first trade and i was wary of sending a watch to an internet based company .
2	e_- mail confirmation of receipt was prompt and i was kept_informed daily , both by email and by phone , of the progress of the sale .
2	the price was fair and i must reserve special praise for james wood who was a friendly , efficient representative of the company .
2	he was charming and reassuring and professional .
2	i will certainly recommend this company as one in which customers can have confidence .
2	easy , site touse and very quick delivery
2	lastminute . com have totally messed_up a 0 day trip to lisbon fior me and 0 of my friends .
2	tried booking flights / hotel package online , saw a good deal , entered_details for 0 people , names , dates of birth etc etc , by the time i pressed confirm , the flights had gone .
2	found alternatives , went down same process , same result .
2	did this 0 times , with no luck .
2	frustrated , i thought i '_d phone them .
2	deal with a real_human .
2	little did i know .
2	again , gave the guy details of what i wanted , told him i had seen something at 000_quid each .
2	hey , i can do something better he says .
2	000_pounds .
2	great says i .
2	gave him all details again for 0 people , by the time he spelt out and repeated every detail i gave him , the flights had gone .
2	he finally found something at over 000_quid , i told him i was not happy , as i had started at 000_quid , he offered 000_quid , now , after 00_minutes , i '_m at over 000_quid .
2	he explained that the flight prices move up and down , ok , i understand that .
2	but if lastminure . com employed a call_centre that had people speaking decent english , the transaction could have been conducted quicker , meaning i would have got my flights .
2	spoke with supervisor , he said he would call me with something within half hour , its now been hour and 00_minutes and nothing , not even the courtesy of a call telling_me they cant help .
2	thanks lastminute . com , you have messed_up our midweek break , and basically you couldnt care less .
2	i will not be using you again , and i recommend that other people dont either .
2	i made the order , the goods were as_described and arrived quickly .
2	very happy with the service .
2	great service , simple to use and goods delivered very quickly .
2	would recommend .
2	great service , i got as much help and advice as i needed when i rang up .
2	delivery was very quick .
2	i was very happy .
2	the samples were sent quickly and the tiles were lovely .
2	i had one question , the phone was answered_immediately and my question answered .
2	the order i made arrived speedily and the tiles were great quality and great value .
2	i would recommend tileclick .
2	i have placed orders with a number of suppliers over the last few_weeks and although most have let_me down with late deliveries due to weather_conditions amazon has , true to form , delivered on time and in a number of instances early .
2	well_done and thanks for maikng my christmas shopping so effortless and stress_free .
2	half way through doing an order and my prepay account didn_'_t have enough money , so i had to go add some ... not entirely_sure what happened but my collection order vanished .
2	sammie to the rescue , she provided me with a link so i didn_'_t have to type it all in again .
2	loads of people moan_about parcel0go , but you have to remember they are brokers , they order couriers on your behalf , if the courier doesn_'_t deliver or collect for whatever_reason , then it is down to the local courier admin or driver .
2	however p0g did refund my money on one delivery that was made late .
2	i have sent 000 odd parcels and only 0 went wrong .
2	pretty good in my book
2	when you order from scan , you get information emails about despatch and then dpd take over and email you on the day of delivery with the hour time_slot in which your delivery should arrive .
2	not only do you get your goods at good prices from scan you don_'_t have to waste your time waiting all day for a courier .
2	better still dpd give you a map and you can see where the courier van is in relation to your address .
2	this is utterly wonderful if you have to nip out for milk or get the kids from school .
2	as long as scan use dpd , i will be ordering from scan .
2	i was notified my parcel would arrive on a tuesday and it did at 0 :_00am ... the delivery driver was polite and friendly ... so all in all a good experience that a few others could_learn from .
2	it was easy to find the inks i needed for my printer and prices were good .
2	i have not used them yet but they seem to be fine .
2	i like that you can send the empty cartridge back in the box provided , not sure how cost_effective it would be against the charity free_postage envelope , but it '_s a nice_touch .
2	next_day delivery and a great price , what more can i say .
2	happy car happy me !
2	if you want batteries and good service then look no further than these_guys .
2	i get all my batteries from them , even if i need them in a hurry , next_day delivery .
2	you get an_email_advising item dispatched almost before you have time to read the order acknowledgement email !
2	you ' re advised of your one hour delivery window and they have never been late once .
2	cannot_praise buyabattery and their delivery partners enough .
2	good range of products at competitive_prices combined with no delivery charges .
2	what more can i say .
2	will use again .
2	it '_s my first stop before i shop .
2	always a good choice if you want a good cross section of reviews by everyday people .
2	i would recommend that all people read up on the products or services here before making a decision to part with their money .
2	yodel have come up_trumps again ... quick delivery and friendly service .
2	then a follow_up to make_sure all went well ... perfect
2	the email asking for my opinion arrived before the items i ordered , but that is irrelevant .
2	dogs like the products ...
2	delivery was fine and the delivery person polite and friendly ... will order from pet_supermarket again
2	ordered christmas_eve via_amazon ... easy transaction ... email_confirmation received ... only problem was none of the links for tracking orders worked in the a . d email ... tried going to their site but still no use ... called on the 00th and was quickly put through to a sales_person ... very friendly and helpful ...
2	i had paid for next_day delivery but as it was christmas week i did not mind being told that they were delivering my item on saturday 00th ... received a message via phone to say delivery would be between 0 and 00 :_00am ...
2	i thought this strange as their website said saturday deliveries started at 0am ...
2	i had to call again at 00 : 00 due to having heard_nothing ... the deliveries were approx 0hr behind ... 00 : 00 and hiway arrived ... two very polite and helpful men unloaded my item ... even_though their trolley had blown a tyre and they had to carry it between them ... fortunately it is not that heavy ... they put it where i asked and all was signed for ...
2	i have read some of the reviews but can only speak as i find ... would order from a . d again and have no_quarms about their using hiway deliveries ... thanks to all concerned
2	the harness i ordered did not fit ( my fault not bdw )... one phone_call ...
2	it was all sorted ...
2	replacement larger_size sent out to me that day and i returned the smaller one ... refund as soon as big dog received it ...
2	happy dog with new harness that fits a treat ...
2	if only all companies were like big dog_world ...
2	please_please don_'_t change as you grow ...
2	i would hate to have to look for another now i have found you ...
2	excellent work big dog_world
2	kept me informed about my order .
2	delivery was quick .
2	items were as_described and in good order .
2	what more could you want .
2	whole_experience was easy and quick - also the delivery man was very helpful and placed the box '_s just where i asked ( as one was quite heavy )
2	so will order again .
2	one thing i am confused about , the email wished me ' happy christmas and new year ' is this late for last_year or early for next ???
2	;-)
2	i can really recommend buying from them , the rose_hip capsules are perfect for my joint pains .
2	most of the time they arrive in the post the very next_day .
2	first_class service from a first_class company .
2	there customer service was second to none , i made a mistake which was my fault yet they went above and beyond to sort it out , cant_praise them enough
2	i found the whole_experience very smooth and trouble free .
2	my family and i really enjoyed our weekend and would be happy to repeat the experience .
2	tickettree were very helpful .
2	i have the attention_span of an pre_- pubescent gnat so when something takes me a while , there is every chance i '_ll lose interest before its finished !
2	not so with selling several spare phones i '_ve accumulated over the years .
2	half a dozen key strokes ( was it as many as that ?)
2	and they are offering me money here , there and everywhere !
2	less_than a week , each time , and the cheque was in my hand .
2	seldom has anything been that simple !
2	and , they offer better rates than the other phone_recycling service that advertises on tv these days .
2	can '_t go_wrong , it seems to me !!
2	!
2	to get set_up to advertise ( among other things ) you have to put in the address of your property .
2	it won_'_t accept mine , and correspondence to an anonymous person or computer come_back over and over that ' they have set_up the address ' - they don_'_t acknowledge that when i try to validate it the " next " or " continue " button is greyed out ( even_though i have sent screen prints ) so i can '_t set_up my ad .
2	hence - no listing , and no bookings … and nearly 0_weeks worth or repetitive e_-_mails getting no where .
2	very frustrating .
2	and all this effort for me to give 00_% of my hard_earned income - if i ever get any !
2	useless .
2	( i will be forward a link of this review to them to make a point )
2	ordered before_noon on wednesday and there it was when i took my balance 00_hours_later - fabulous service !
2	having purchased an item that was definitely still selling at over double the price i paid for , i was very pleased with the efficiency of the ordering and delivery service .
2	i would definitely recommend and use them again .
2	purchased a dualit_toaster at a very competitive price after doing an online search .
2	service from ordering to delivery was very efficient and product well_packed .
2	dpd delivery slot was helpful in being_able to plan to be about .
2	free delivery was an added_bonus !
2	having used vitabiotics online for first time found the ease of ordering & timescale of delivery excellent .
2	their 0 for 0 was excellent value and no delivery charges made it even better !
2	having submitted an_email quote request , i was called back within 00mins with the quote .
2	they appeared knowledgeable and were able to provide all the answers i needed to decide to take the insurance with them .
2	an_alternative quote was much more_expensive .
2	having decided to take out the insurance this was done very simply over the phone and documentation emailed over immediately .
2	obviously the proof will be if i ever need to claim - but hopefully that will never happen !!
2	i now intend to look at other items to ask them to quote on to see if better_than placing them on my household_insurance where an excess would apply if i had to claim .
2	was impressed by range available and the service was great - items received by return .
2	quality and value for money excellent and won_'_t_hesitate to use them again .
2	great rate and free delivery .
2	ordered on monday_morning arrived following_morning .
2	would definitely use again .
2	placed order afternoon , item arrived next_day , no_hesitation in dealing_with this company again .
2	i ordered a softest brushed cotton baby_blanket in blue which is lovely , really soft , warm and lovely pastel colours , and allso arrived within a couple of days of ordering .
2	i had spoke to the staff on the phone with a query and found them to be really friendly and helpfull .
2	very good service , would have no_reservations_about ordering from them again .
2	excellent service with superfast delivery and much_cheaper_than the vets !
2	!
2	fantastic service and price , don_'_t bother with duty_free or ebay , just log on for excellent deals on great brands , some of which are better_than 0 / 0 price !
2	shopped here loads of times sorry high_street you just can '_t compete .
2	i cannot_fault the company but the item i bought left a lot to be desired
2	this is the second time i have used this company as they stock the refills for the pens i like to use at an affordable cost .
2	delivery has always been very swift and i would happily_recommend them
2	was pleased with service and delighted with product .
2	buying in bulk saved me time and money .
2	i will certainly use company again with confidence
2	ordered a ' cheap ' laptop from val_- u - computers which has arrived today , for the price i paid - £_000 . 00 including_vat and delivery , it is far better_than i expected .
2	i chose an ibm t00 which so far is working like a dream , with no visible marks or scratches .
2	this is the third time i have used val_- u - computers , first for a laptop for work , then one for my husband , this one is for me to replace my old desktop .
2	i can_trust this company and would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a refurbished computer , why pay top prices when you can go here .
2	i ordered duvets , covers and pillows from this company via_amazon .
2	the pillows were not in the parcel so i tried_ringing them .
2	each time i phoned the answer machine cut in , i tried over and over again but no reply .
2	i looked on their website and found an_email address , so i emailed them , still no reply .
2	it was only after_contacting them via_amazon that they eventually sent an_email_saying they had sent the pillows with the other stuff - no they had not , and so they would have to investigate via their despatch department and carrier .
2	what a load of rubbish that is , the cost of pillows is under_£ 0 .
2	the goods were okay as you get what you pay for , but there is no customer service whatsoever and are the worst company i have ever come_across .
2	it is not worth the hassle of dealing_with them .
2	we are so impressed with this company !
2	we will recommend you to all of our friends .
2	we ordered 0 xxl_bean_bags " man size " faux_leather and also received 0 bean_bag footstools faux_leather " free " .
2	we live on the isle of man - we ordered them on the eve of 00th_july and received them in perfect_condition in the afternoon on 0nd august !
2	and they charged a very reasonable delivery charge - so many companies take a long time to deliver to the isle of man from uk_mainland and also often charge a massive delivery charge .
2	we bought them for our 00yr_old_son '_s ( who is 0ft ) newly_decorated bedroom for him and his friends to sit on when they are on the play station .
2	the beanbags are a perfect size and very comfortable too .
2	thank_you so much for your fast , reasonably_priced and efficient service !
2	i '_d certainly recommend travelex - good rates and picking_up security side at airports means you are not carrying a lot of cash around or keeping it at home .
2	all worked_fine - got valuation , got sent envelope to send phone back in , sent phone , got money .
2	result !
2	the lady that helped_me was quick and efficient and very patient , she resolved the problem i was experiencing straight_away .
2	good service , fast shipping
2	an easy to use website , with first_class comfy products of excellent quality , and good value for money with speedy delivery .
2	i would have no_hesitation in recommending your company and your products .
2	couldn_'_t_believe_how speedily my order was processed and delivered , within_00hrs , most impressed .
2	the items orders were good quality and value for money and well_packaged .
2	everything about my order was handled quickly , efficiently and professionally .
2	excellent service .
2	especially as i had clicked_onto the wrong fire grate and asked if they could change my order !!
2	which they did - no_hassle - just got on and did it .
2	the delivery was so quick and we are so pleased with the items we ordered , the grate looks great !!!
2	would have no_hesitation in recommending ray_grahams , its been a long time since i '_ve been this impressed with a company , so well_done to all atray grahams .
2	darcy the dog , so loves the food we get from pet_supermarket .
2	easy to use site and delivery always_arrives on date they say and a bargain price .
2	i have used them for a few_times and each time products and delivery fantastic .
2	great choice and good prices .
2	you will not be disappointed .
2	been using this company for many many_years and have always had 0st_class service and customer service are always very efficient .
2	thank_you catherine_corless with you ' re excellent help with a difficult order could '_t have done it without you x
2	the airport to hotel and return_journey service provided by suntransfers was second to none .
2	the drivers were on time and polite .
2	cost for two of us return_journey from paphos airport to our hotel was cheaper_than any coach transfers we could find .
2	would always try this service first next time and cannot recommend it highly_enough .
2	found wonderful deals on this site .
2	this is my first order .
2	i hope to do more business with them .
2	from the moment i ordered my tickets , the friendly and professional service of double0tickets reassured me that they were better_than other ticket agencies that i have used previously .
2	when i was notified that the tickets would not be with us until after christmas , they issued a wonderful voucher which i used as part of my daughters present and i was later informed that the tickets would be with us by the end of january but they actually arrived the first week of january .
2	well_done double0 , i would definately use them again and not_hesitate to recommend them .
2	it is fantastic to speak to somebody on the phone , in this country , who_knows what they are talking_about .
2	my son - in - law was extremely impressed with his whiskey gift - he sampled it as soon as he opened the package and said it was one of the best he had ever_tasted .
2	the other men guests ( when they were allowed to sample ) said the same .
2	for my part , ordering was very easy and delivery was exactly when stated in the confirming e_- mail .
2	great service , wonderful product - will be ordering again soon - after new year when this bottle runs_out .
2	happy new year to you all .
2	glad i found this site - exceptional value , easy to navigate site , very clear and easy to
2	find what you want and delivery really fast - would recommend them to anyone
2	absolutely_brilliant site for toys games and puzzles not seen_elsewhere at tremendous prices .
2	good for any aspiring creative child in the family and the ones who love puzzles and games - from the very young to older_children and adults .
2	good prices , excellent service and delivery .
2	great service from ordering to receipt of goods .
2	cat beds have gone down a treat with both cats curled up cosy and warm in both the radiator bed and the soft round one - purring their appreciation and no more waking_up my daughter in the early hours by laying across her and trying to kiss her awake !!
2	all she can hear now is contented purring from the direction of the radiator in her bedroom so they all get a good nights_sleep !
2	" great pillows and sheets .
2	verdict from granddaughter was " so cosy and soft " and she likes her comfort so that is a very good recommendation .
2	delivery just as predicted .
2	again i have recommended your site to all family and friends for their replacement bedlinen products .
2	i wouldn_'_t shop anywhere_else for these . "
2	great product - mac - in - a - sac .
2	prompt delivery and exactly_what i wanted for the inclement_weather we are having .
2	price was reasonable too .
2	very impressed with the prices , delivery and goods - the handles i ordered exceeded_expectations .
2	i have used one set ( putting them on as i decorate each room ) and they look fantastic .
2	very good quality - better_than the local_diy_store especially on price .
2	have already_recommended them to my sister and nephew .
2	i find the whole_experience of going to a garage quite hideous so home tyre_fitting is for me .
2	i also like the way i can choose the tyres i want fitted according to my budget rather_than being told what will be fitted by a salesman in a garage with a screen i cant see , in front of him , not me .
2	the fitters have always been courteous and friendly and keep me informed as to when they are going to arrive .
2	shane who came today has_been here before so its nice to see a familiar face again .
2	at_least the sun shone today so he could fit the tyres in the dry !
2	always recommend and use this company now .
2	thank_you shane .
2	i have just recently returned from las_vegas and san_francisco on the 00th_september_0000 .
2	dialaflight were amazing , i dealt_with chris who organised everything right down to the last detail , even making_sure we had done our visas online for america .
2	no nasty_surprises when it came to baggage charges as he had made sure these were included even on the domestic legs of our flights , as some passengers were having to pay extra .
2	i have already_reccomended him to some people we met whilst we were in vegas and will_continue to do so , particularly as i am an ex travel_agent .
2	congratulations dialaflight we had an amazing time .
2	many_thanks lesley carson
2	absolutely fantastic .
2	totaly stress_free booking of a long weekend away with friends .
2	wish me luck
2	tried the rest now have the best .
2	don_'_t waste your money on cheap products and equipment .
2	you ' re worth more than them .
2	you deserve the best .
2	so what are you waiting for ?
2	the ultimate in hair_care products and equipment
2	exactly_what i needed .
2	fit the car model perfectly .
2	very prompt service .

2	order was processed straight_away , i was advised of this .
2	it arrived very swiftly .
2	very satisfied .
2	thank_you .
2	i will be back !
2	its just so easy to order your lenses through this website .
2	quick delivery too .
2	i found age_partnership to be very friendly and efficient in sorting_out what can at times be a complicated issue .
2	from the time i first contacted them i was told exactly how to proceed through the maze of buying a pension_annuity and any_queries i had were dealt_with and answered in a professional and proficient manner .
2	i would not_hesitate in recommending age_partnership to my friends .
2	janet slate 000000
2	found site via browsing the internet and it was quick and easy to fill out .
2	the price was good and when i needed to email a query got an_instant helpful response .
2	finally after many_years of saving and looking we decided to get ' real ' wood furniture to finish our lounge .
2	trawling the web oak_furniture solutions kept coming up on our searches and were very good prices .
2	we researched feedback and found most people were extremely happy and praised the quality of goods , delivery often faster_than_expected .
2	so we finally placed our order , 0 - 0_weeks unless in stock .
2	imagine our delight when it was delivered 0_days_later , it was wrapped so well there was no_doubt nothing would be damaged .
2	the young delivery man helped_us get the furniture in the house and was extremely pleasant .
2	then we unpacked - well we were amazed_at the quality of this furniture considering the price .
2	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend this company , you get excellent quality , helpful staff and quick delivery , having shopped_around we know we have got a quality bargain !
2	the mug turned_out perfect - the picture on it great and it keeps beverages hot or cold for a long , long time .
2	best travel mug i have ever had .
2	i ordered goods on the website on one day and it was delivered on the next_day , really impressed , was expecting it to take 0 - 0_days , only paid for standard delivery too .
2	first time i have used this company and i was really very impressed with them .
2	the plants were a really good size and healthy , the packaging was excellent and a very prompt delivery service .
2	they kept me up to date with what and when .
2	can '_t fault them at all .
2	will definitely use again .
2	easy website to use , fast delivery , good products , pity don_'_t do bigger_sizes for womens jumpers .
2	i needed some buckwheat , googled it and found healthy_supplies , but that wasn_'_t all .
2	the company also supplied everything else i could think of and it was nearly all organic .
2	i found their website very easy to use , it even generated a password for me and provided parcel tracking .
2	i particularly_appreciated their crystal - clear discounting system .
2	it '_s all been very well thought out .
2	i placed my first order on sunday and received a complete order on tuesday , that '_s it , within one working day .
2	all the products appeared to be excellent and they weren_'_t over - packaged .
2	everything about this family firm is great .
2	order with confidence !
2	therughouse is an excellent firm .
2	you will find an_enormous choice of rugs , mats and runners for every situation .
2	the vagaries of the high_street will be a thing of the past .
2	this is the best thing .
2	secondly , i would put good value and prompt delivery .
2	what is unusual , though , especially online , is that the rug_house will provide a personal service .
2	any_queries you e_- mail will be answered .
2	care will be taken .
2	trust me .
2	i '_ve placed four orders in the last couple of months .
2	delivery was quick but asked for delivery to a different address as per order form .
2	however failed to follow the instructions and the item ended_up being sent to billing_address .
2	great idea - great service - keep you informed every_step of the way
2	this was so quick and easy !
2	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend mazuma_mobile to anyone - you won_'_t be disappointed
2	goods ordered on a sunday_evening arrived well_packaged and promptly on tuesday .
2	excellent quality products , fast effivcient service and great prices
2	absolutely the worst ever service , from customer service to no service , several complaints resolved in aparently no line faults , then an engineer came round and confirmed there were several , up to 00 times in one min ... after trying to make them understand , that they had charged me more than i signed_up for after two months of incorrect bills , and many calls from the mobile , for which they had the number , said i was not entitled to compensation for the costs .
2	they would not let_me lodge a complaint after 00_mins on the phone , and said they would call me every day until i agreed to close it , well i won_'_t .
2	only offered me what they had overcharged in the first place .
2	they wanted 00 . 00 for me to end the contract that they are not supplying , well i will take it to the ombudsman first . oh and as if by magic the line came back for 0 mins , and low and behold their systems are always down so you can '_t be transferred to someone with a brain and have to keep pressing 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 and repeating all your details over and over , so frustrating and angry .
2	don_'_t go with this lot .....

2	i was very impressed with the frame i ordered from this company .
2	i originally ordered it not worrying_about when i would get it .
2	i then needed it within a couple of days as we were visiting our friends earlier_than planned and it was a present .
2	i telephoned the company and spoke to a very helpful lady .
2	she said she would see what she could do .
2	0_days_later the frame arrived !
2	the colour of the frame was exactly as shown on their website .
2	it was beautifully made , the perfect size and of good quality .
2	i would highly_recommend their products and can '_t fault their efficiency .
2	i would not_hesitate to use them again .
2	their website was also very easy to use and the frame was a very reasonable_price compared to other estimates we had been given .
2	ordered goods one day and received the next_morning .
2	updated by email all the way .
2	very impressed .
2	had an xbox_000 problem which wasn_'_t the red ring of death , so took it in for a look - see .
2	friendly attention with a slight raised eyebrow when it was plugged in and worked just fine .
2	so , nice chappie suggested we leave it running for a day .
2	went to pick it up and lo & behold , i wasn_'_t the daft wee wifey and the problem had occurred ( much to my relief !)
2	all fixed , polished and returned with a smile and a cheery hello by name .
2	you really can '_t ask for better service .
2	keep_up the good work , chaps & chapesses !
2	booked our holiday through travel_republic on the friday_night online and was leaving for our holiday on the sunday .
2	all my information came through extremely quickly confirming our flights , accommodation , transfers and airport_parking throgh email .
2	i checked information and found a spelling_mistake in my name and make of car , called travel_republic next_morning and they resolved problem very swiftly so i was able to print necessary_documents for travelling .
2	everything went very smoothly with travel and accommodation .
2	accommodation was excellent and well_worth the money .
2	i am very satisfied with my dealings with travel_republic and would recommend them to family snd friends and of course would book through travel_republic again .
2	i bought a barbour_jacket from country_attire at christmas and was very pleased with the buying experience but then just three_months later a press stud popped off . given what i paid for the jacket i was a bit put out and i e_mailed the company for advice . i did that at about 0 . 00_pm and was rather amazed when i got a reply within less_than five_minutes and very helpful it was too . i was given clear_instructions as to what i had to do which entailed sending the jacket back to them , at no charge to me . in no time at all i got a reply ; they agreed the jacket was a write off and offered me the choice of a credit on my account or i could chose a replacement . sadly the jacket i had was no_longer in stock so i picked another which was more_expensive but i was given some money off as a good will gesture and before i knew it they had delivered it . to be honest i actually prefer it to the other one . i can say without_hesitation this company offer a first_class courteous efficient service way beyond my expectations and i would not_hesitate using them again or recommending them to anyone_else . i dealt_with liam , who should be congratulated on doing a very good job . if there was a six star_rating i '_d give it .
2	i '_ve booked quite a few hotel stays with alpha_rooms and have always found the procedure to be simple , efficient and quick .
2	this time , i made a ridiculous mistake and booked accommodation for the wrong night .
2	alpha_rooms were very helpful indeed and helped_me to rectify the error .
2	i was very impressed and a special thank_you to eddie who was great .
2	a big thanks to sarah_hayes for all her help .
2	a quick solution was found to my problem in a professional way .
2	00 out of 00 for sarah_hayes .
2	ordered one day , goods arrived the next .
2	what more can i say .
2	i will definitely be back
2	ordered as birthday_present for very discerning mum
2	she was thrilled , as before , with the flowers and the quality of the bouquet .
2	will definitely use again and again .
2	placed our first order after being inspired by richard '_s tutorials .
2	there were a couple of errors on the delivery - a quick phone_call to wineworks soon resolved the problem and correct items were with me the next_day .
2	will definitely be a regular customer in the future .
2	have been buying from viovet for some time now and i can '_t fault them .
2	their service is excellent , their prices are very competitive and they stock a wide varitey of products .
2	items are always well_packed and delivery is very quick .
2	i '_m never worried when i order from viovet , i know i will get excellent service and on the rare_occasion there is a hitch it '_s dealt_with pleasantly and efficiently .
2	very happy to recommend viovet on here and in ' real_life '
2	it is unfair that late charge fees are put on to the account even if you are 0 day late .
2	it is just an extra way of making money .
2	booking online was easy and tickets arrived nice and early .
2	i would use get me in again .
2	simple to use , easy to book , but had trouble printing out my booking ( may just be me ).
2	i couldn_'_t_believe_how quickly this order arrived .
2	it took less_than half a day and was a good fit and exactly as_described .
2	this was very good value for money , as was my previous order and i would not_hesitate to recommend this company to anybodt .
2	car was collected within 0 minutes of us arriving and upon our return we had to wait no_longer_than 0 / 00_minutes ...
2	excellent services friendly staff . would not use any other service from now on .
2	i booked and paid £_00 . 00 online with parcel_monkey to get a parcel sent to coventry next_day on 0 / 0th_feb_0000 .
2	it was collected by city_link no problem but i was amazed to find parcel arrived back to me 00 days_later - no explanation , card or phone_call apologising or even giving me a reason .
2	tried_calling parcel_monkey but no telephone_numbers avail .
2	contact has to made via their online support which is slow and unresponsive ..
2	i gave a detailed email explaining the problem but it has taken 00_hours for someone called ' may ' to ask if they can be of any help to contact them !
2	for crying out loud , all i want is for my parcel to be collected and to be delivered to its_destination .
2	unhappy customer .
2	i wanted a full set of quality tyres for our a0 sline .
2	tyres on the drive gave a competitive quote and were able to fit next_day .
2	excellent service , friendly fitter .
2	so glad i '_ve found chemist_direct .
2	i first used them for embarrassing cream for scabies that my daughter had caught from a friend but they can supply much more than that .
2	try them for pet_food , shampoos and makeup .
2	prices are good and delivery is quick .
2	i '_ve been using dialaflight on and off for years and have invariably been satisfied with their assistance .
2	while perfectly capable of booking on line , i travel a fair bit to africa and like having the backup of a larger organisation with abta status should anything go_wrong .
2	i recently ' discovered ' robert , who is enthusiastic , conscientious and has a great sense of humour in the face of a customer senior_moment - gold_dust .
2	i have to congratulate and thank_you for such efficiency .
2	from the time i ordered my " computer_desk " i received up dates from you until it was delivered .
2	your staff who delivered it where so cheerful and informative .
2	i would recommend your firm to every one , especially my friends .
2	i will certainly purchase from you again .
2	many_thanks
2	regards

2	wanted front_row seats for a particular concert .
2	googled it and found double0tickets . com were offering just what we wanted at a great price and they have turned_up in plenty of time .
2	really easy to deal with and highly_recommended .
2	would definitely use them again .
2	ordered prescription only meds - no_problems at all .
2	fast delivery , good price and recognised my prescription when i logged on again to order item again .
2	from the initial_enquiry to the final delivery i was treated with respect and excellent attention .
2	the prices given were negotiated well and i thought the salesperson did all she could to get me the best price .
2	the actual quality of the product - oak_doors - was superb andn they look very classy now they are in_situ .
2	payment was easy and delivery was done to suit .
2	i would , however , ensure that the delivered goods are inspected are immediately ( as you are advised to do ) - i couldn_'_t due to their weight and later found one of the corners slightly_damaged ( which , had i found sooner , could have been replaced without a problem ).
2	nevertheless , i would have no_hesitation in recommending both this company and their product to anyone .
2	thank_you for consistently excellent customer service - a rarity_these days sometimes !
2	having worn out my old office_chair i went on line and looked at various_sites selling all_sorts of office chairs .
2	the style and price were important to me and i eventually_settled for one from furniture at work .
2	i was a little_apprehensive as i had never used this firm before .
2	however , i ordered one based on their description and it arrived promptly and was exactly as_described .
2	it took a bit of work putting it together but once it was whole i tried it out and found it to be really comfortable , easy to manoeuver and supportive where it was needed .
2	i would recommend this firm to any one needing reliable service and good products for office situations .
2	i am amazed to see there are some customers who have had problems .
2	i found a good quality mattress at a competitive price , chose a delivery day and it arrived well_wrapped promptly on the due day .
2	i will certainly recommend this company and will use them again if i have the need to buy anything_else .
2	my only_complaint with lovefilm is that they say " unlimited ", but it is actually limited by their poor turnaround time .
2	i am waiting at_least 0_days inbetween sending back a dvd and getting the next one delivered , but its more like a week .
2	i discovered cat wormers in granule form from the viovet website .
2	delivery was immediate and instead of the usual struggle trying to administer tablets , you just mix the granules with a little food and watch the unknowing cat eat !
2	i was left with one big smug smile !!!
2	( well three actually as all my cats were wormed without a battle ! )
2	i was dubious at first but after_reading online newspaper articles that praised housenetwork & after considering the options i took the plunge , it is a big decision .
2	i have opted for the first_class package , costing me about £_000 compared with 0 . 0 %- 0 % charged by the high_street .
2	the service is in a word , brilliant !
2	inundated with viewers who all say how professional housenetwork are & how good the photos are .
2	the brochures are excellent too .
2	i have absolutely no_regrets & you can get a 0 %_discount using code : jomgbguuyy .
2	the high_street estate_agent is miles behind .
2	the item arrived really quickly and was just what i wanted and matched the description the item works great and would recommend the company
2	thank_you for a great service
2	i ordered a bouquet as a thank_you gesture to a friend .
2	upon_receipt of order & notification of despatch , i ordered a further bouquet for my mother in law .
2	late on in evening i received a generic email & text to inform_me the flowers were on way .
2	just by_chance i looked into the tracking .
2	i was so upset to read the flowers had been messed_up .
2	they had sent wrong bouquet & wrong message to recipients .
2	i tried in vien to resolve this but the email only customer service were useless .
2	no matter_how i tried , even posting them my receipt and acknowledgement , they just reply chapter & verse a generic_reply of no use nor ownership of the mess up .
2	the whole_experience & flowers received were a total disgrace .
2	if you are considering purchasing flowers , please choose wisely .
2	serenata promise a full 000_% guarantee / refund of not satisfied .
2	this is not the case nor are they interested in their customer_satisfaction .
2	there are lots of reputable florists on line ; serenata are not in the running & they should be ashamed of their service !!
2	!
2	sent my sons sony_ericsson after been quoted £_000 . 00 .
2	however , after many emails they quote the phone was never received .
2	having recorded the delivery and questioned them about having actually signed for package , they now claim they had received the package but the packet was empty ( no handset ).
2	we have managed to use the tracking device which was still in use on handset and shall be sending our proof of this been a fraudulent company to trading_standards as they still deny handling / received handset which evidently is not the case .
2	i '_m surprised they believe they can actually continue trading with such unethical and underhand deception to unsuspecting and goodwill on customers behalf '_s .
2	watch this space , better still watch watchdog or similar as that is the reality for these crooks ....
2	.
2	currently trying to resolve matter with post_office resolutions , not a good service nor an expected outcome .
2	i do not recommend mobilephonexchange , nor do i approve them having trading
2	placed my order on the 00th_november , paid_extra for saturday delivery .
2	received an_email at 00 . 00_hours the night before advising that my order delivery date had been changed .
2	contacted them by phone on the saturday_morning to complain and was asked when would i like the order to be delivered again .
2	said the following saturday but i was not willing to pay another extra_charge for a saturday delivery and i wanted a refund of the extra_charge that i had already paid .
2	they took the full_amount out of my account so had to contacted them again to request the refund again , finally got it .
2	the following friday received another email at 00 . 00pm advising that my order would not be delivered yet again .
2	when i contacted them again they could not tell me why my order was not delivered as it was sitting in the deport waiting to go .
2	i said that i wanted this before wednesday the following week and they said that would be arranged .
2	advised i wanted it delivered in the afternoon .
2	got an_email today to advise that my order had been despatched and would be delivered tomorrow between 0 . 00am and 0 . 00pm , so much for requesting an afternoon delivery .
2	will wait and see if it actually gets delivered this time .
2	first time of using this company .
2	excellent service .
2	very pleasant staff - walsall branch - and so convenient .
2	would definitely use again oh , and i saved money !
2	excellent service , promptly delivered
2	we were sold a sofa and talked into fabric care ( which they gave my friend free !!!!)
2	and insurance that we didn_'_t want - tried to cancel no luck .
2	told them in store we needed a 0 hour_slot for delivery in order to book time off - told certainly however no chance you have to wait in all day - in my opinion we were thoroughly misled - would i recommend - no not unless you have your wits about you
2	the look book came through the post and a super stylish outfit caught my eye straight_away , ordered thurs tea time arrived friday_morning - worn friday_night - fab !!
2	!
2	i called a week_ago to ask where my loyalty cheque was ( after waiting 00 days ) response was its on the desk waitingto be posted - may be another week - on complaining was informed youre lucky to get a cheque not all companies offer a dual_fuel discount !!!!!!!
2	sorry but thatwas the reason i chose this company , cheque still notarrived after 00 days called again at my expense - no one in accounts and there has_been a problem with some cheques - you may have to wait another 00 days !!!!!!!
2	this is unnaceptanle disgraceful management and i feel that you no_longer deserve my custom - i made a commitment toyou topay in full - on time for dual_fuel - wheres your commitment to me ?????
2	not good enough
2	just read due to unprecedented demand response to emails could take 0_days ah ah ah unprecedented complaints more like
2	update no promised call_backs and not surprisingly still no cheques !!!
2	!
2	wish_id looked on here before i signed_up - avoid at all cvost

2	wish i '_d found them before .
2	ordered at 0 :_00pm - delivered the next_morning .
2	pricing very keen as well
2	excellent help and service from my first enquiry right through to the delivery , i found the delivery service extra special , i received a text the day before to say that it was being delivered the following_day , with an option of changing that if not convenient to me , and then first thing on the morning of the delivery i received another text with a one hour_window of the delivery time , which proved to be spot_on .
2	well_done and thank_you to all .
2	lovely quality , a little heavier_than i expected , but easy managable .
2	myself and my hubby are 00 years of age and need it for grandchildren , so its a godsend .
2	i would recommend it to anyone .
2	have used them many_times over 0 years , mostly for dect phone batteries .
2	the prices are great , product what it should be and delivery is super_fast .
2	wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else .
2	i use pet_supermarket for my wild_bird_food , feeders and housing as products are high_quality at sensible prices that just can '_t be_beaten .
2	the packaging is always good and fast delivery .
2	nothing to say but praise and glad to have found them .
2	i have used this site for many_years and have always found it easy to use offering a wide_selection of productsand a good description for each item .
2	it offers good value for money and delivery is usually within 00_hours .
2	the site continues to improve and offers many ways to pay including paypal .
2	i have recommended this site to many people and will_continue to do so .
2	i find the website easy to use and the prices are very reasonable .
2	superb !
2	a good choice of products sent quickly with no_hassle , i bought a couple of halti products and they were cheaper_than amazon !
2	easy to use , choice of carriers and prices , tracking on all goods
2	they make money from me phoning them as they insist on using a chargeable number , unles you subscribe to the sky phone service , then they keep you waiting for 00_mins before someone tells you to ring a different number or makes you reboot the box which ive already done .
2	there is no e_mail address for this company which is ridiculous given that they supply internet services and expect me to use the online service to order from them !!
2	!
2	hi i recently bought a new conduction hob and found my pots and pans did not work on it .
2	i went online to procook and bought new ones .

2	the website was easy to follow and i even got money off with a promotion_code .
2	the pans arrived properly wrapped for protection and there was a booklet of other items they have for sale too .
2	and another code for money off .
2	this is a great site to use for all of your cooking stuff .
2	highly_recommend it and i will visit again for myself and gifts for family and friends .
2	something for the man who is the love of my life but difficult to buy for .

2	was after a pair of new wellies and because i walk miles with my dogs needed a decent pair .
2	found the ones i wanted and the best price i could find was from easy wellies .
2	the other customers reviews were very helpful and the website easy to use and very nicely set out .
2	hopefully the wellies will last me years but in the meantime i shall recommend easy wellies to all !
2	highly_recommend this company , have used them several_times in the past .
2	nice website , easy to navigate and alot of information about the products with good photos .
2	customer service is second to none .
2	i have always found the staff at normans to be very knowledgeable and helpful - every order i have placed has_been safely and very quickly received - i am often staggered at the speed of delivery - and delighted at the secure_packaging which means the products arrive in top condition
2	i always recommend normans to everyone and will_continue to be a loyal_customer
2	my sister has had a recent_bereavement and i wanted to send her some flowers as a little surprise to help cheer_her up .
2	at 00 . 00 i had to ring and ask her if she '_d received anything because i felt sure she would have rung if they had .
2	the surprise now spoilt , she then had to go out and hunt_around the house to see if she could find them .
2	there was no card through the door and so it was obvious no one had attempted a delivery .
2	i wrote to customer_services who said they would contact the couriers but it would be 00 to 00hrs before they could let_me know !!
2	!
2	at 0 . 00hrs this morning , my sister found the flowers dumped on the doorstep .
2	no card or explanation and no idea how long they had been there .
2	the whole_experience was upsetting and embarrassing and as far as the company was concerned ( as i '_ve no reply ) the flowers are delivered , end of story .
2	i wouldn_'_t use this company again and the company certainly need to review the couriers they currently use .
2	all the bad_reviews on twitter are mainly regarding delivery , so that should tell them something ..... hopefully !!
2	!
2	what a disaster !
2	my boyfriend and i were left_stranded in the middle of london with a very important function to attend .
2	easytobook . com just sent us from one non_existent booking to another .
2	we ended_up staying in a b_& b that we found ourselves and missed the funcition .
2	take my advice , use anyone_else !
2	!
2	the machine i was looking for , the cheapest one i found and with a prompt delivery service .
2	the website was easy to navigate , all the information i wanted was there , on the same page as the item description , and free delivery - what more could any girl wish for .
2	i was tempted , the machine was sold and is now fully settled in my sewing room .
2	who needs rock and roll when i have a quickly reducing stash of delightful fabric and a machine that doesn_'_t want to stop .
2	easy to operate and great results .
2	am i happy ?
2	very much so .
2	when i read my confirmation_email i had a fit of laughter .
2	you are definatly original which i hope never changes .
2	you gave a fast and effecient service and i csn say hand on heart i will use you again and i will also recommend you .
2	thank_you for making my a happy customer

2	ordered late on thursday , delivered early on monday .
2	what more could one ask for ?
2	will definitely use this site again .
2	i don_'_t know how they do it - but they do .
2	it '_s a well know saying - " you get what you pay for " this does not apply to parcel pete .
2	looking at their prices you would expect a rubbish service , but what a pleasant_surprise you will get .
2	they provide a reliable door to door service for a very low price .
2	i have used most of the delivery services for my parcels and found parcel pete the best and yodel the worst .
2	so , if you want a worry free delivery service at a price you can_afford give parcel pete a try .

2	the mop is quick and easy to use , much_better_than a mop and bucket .
2	the delivery was very quick and the price very good , a saving of over_£_00 on the list price .
2	it is always best to check out who you are buying from when purchasing on the internet .
2	i have found brennands to be safe and reliable , recommended .
2	i am a great fan of eyelash_extensions and have been to lots of beauty salons and eyelash technicians and i can_honestly_say this lady really knows her stuff .

2	i buy true mrp to replace breakfast .
2	i only use half a pkt mixed with skimmed_milk , coconut milk and a raw egg .
2	it tastes great ( milk choc is the best ).
2	so using only half a pkt gives a good consistency , not too thick , tastes good , and is very economical .
2	the price is very good and the delivery excellent , you get a text or email giving a delivery slot so no more waiting in all day .

2	would recommend to anybody .
2	goods arrived next_day .
2	good pricing and easy to use website .
2	i ordered a range of goods and was kept_informed as to delivery .
2	once despatched it arrived the next_day .
2	this is the second hatch_bag we have had and cant_fault it at all .
2	its easy to fit and keep clean , even after our weimaraners have been in it with dirty paws etc .
2	excellent ...
2	purchased £ 0000 worth of furniture last_year .
2	poor delivery service ,
2	promised a mirror which never arrived even after several phone_calls to customer_services .
2	sideboard was damaged , engineer made an attempt to fix and company offered £_00 discount which again we never received .
2	can not recommend this company due to poor customer service .
2	update
2	after_reading this review the company has_been in touch and all issues has_been resolved but that took over 0_months
2	whenever we stay at a pi which is often either for leisure or business , the standard of service is the same regardless of the age of the staff .
2	particularly impressed that some who seem so young , appear to have a genuine desire to please and help customers beyond_expectation .
2	have stayed in many hotels overseas of very high_standard and the quality of the staff at pis matches these standards .
2	only ever had a couple of problems ( mainly with wifi ) which have been sorted_out quickly and satisfactorily by a member of staff .
2	we would never stay anywhere_else in uk .
2	lesley hill
2	wrong goods delivered with correct invoice_inside .
2	it was dealt_with efficiently and politely and the correct goods were despatched and received the next_day .
2	the incorrect goods were collected on the day they were received .
2	perhaps it would not normally matter , but i was flying to cyprus the day after the correct goods arrived , but it could have been too late .
2	however 00 out of 00 for the way it was all put reight
2	quick delivery and product exactly as_described .
2	very good value .
2	i '_ve never used yodel to send parcels yet but their deliveries to me are second to none .
2	the driver is always cheerful and pleasant .
2	delivery has always been on time .
2	i ordered items last night after 0pm 0th_dec_0000 and they arrived this afternoon , 0th_dec .
2	excellent !!
2	!
2	i have been ordering from woolworths for a while now and have always been happy with my purchases .
2	would highly_recommend .
2	i won a bag from this company and i was sceptical as to the quality .
2	how wrong i was .
2	the quality was superb and i have now been using it every day since i won it , which was over a year_ago .
2	updated 00th sep , 0000 .
2	have since bought another bag for my mum for a wedding .
2	she loved it as it was a clutch_bag with plenty room for her bits n bobs
2	i have ordered from amazon on many occasions and have always been pleased with my purchases .
2	i don_'_t think i have ever had to return anything .
2	each time i have ordered from battery_force , my order has arrived within 0 or 0_days .
2	twice i wasn_'_t sure on the exact kind of batteries i needed and on both_occasions asked battery_force for help and received very nice replies with direct links to the items i need .
2	a great company providing first_class service .
2	wonderful service .
2	the only problem was i could not believe the price !
2	ordering and delivery went like a dream .
2	there were no extra_charges for delivery .
2	perfect , i would certainly use again and will recommend to my friends .
2	wonderful !
2	wonderful service and delivery .
2	the watch is just what i had been searching for and at nearly_£_000 below hightstreet prices .
2	i was a little_apprehensive_about purchasing such am expensive watch via a company i had never_heard off + the price being so low .
2	but i was wrong to worry .
2	excellent service i would certainly shop with them again and recommend them to my friends and family .
2	i ordered this wallet online , and was slightly_worried what the quality would be , but it is superb and you would never believe_how quickly it arrived .
2	i say use them with confidence
2	i bought a solitary beehive .
2	very good price and well made .
2	packaging was excellent .
2	only_concern is that inside the box when it arrived was a fairly heavy booklet advertising bar b q '_s which i had not requested .
2	did i end up paying the postage on that too ?
2	in the last two years i have purchased a long wool cardigan and a polo neck jumper .
2	within a few_days of wearing both items they became pilled and began to lose their shape .
2	i was attracted by the photos of both items in woolovers catalogue .
2	what a mistake !
2	both items have fallen_apart , mainly under the arms and at the neck .
2	i have repaired the cardigan myself . the polo neck i have worn no more than twice , and the seam at the neck has a hole in it .
2	i am really appalled at the poor quality of both items given the prices .
2	the polo neck sweater ; is supposedly lambs_wool but it is very itchy and unpleasant to wear .
2	perhaps woolovers could_learn a few lessons in quality sweaters from places like marks and spencer and topshop .
2	needed a gift for a birthday for an 00yr_old logged on and got prefect pressy a lovely bouquet that was delivered the next_day with choice of added_extras i got hand made chocolates with mine and i thot they were very reasonably price to i will prob use again .
2	thanks for letting_me know of this company think i gonna stick with them love the offers
2	these fitflops are so comfortable my feet love them .
2	best money i '_ve spent on footwear in ages .
2	i love them .
2	i came_across place overseas on - line almost exactly six years_ago when i was looking for an apartment in turkey - and i have never looked back !
2	i had many conversations with cameron , whose professional experience , guidance and knowledge was very helpful .
2	once i had decided on kalkan as my preferred area off i went on my own for a viewing weekend where omer looked after me so well , ferrying me around to many apartments within my meagre budget - even to the point of taking me to his parents farm one evening up in the mountains to enjoy a fabulous meal with their neighbours .
2	narrowing_down my choices i was finally able to come to a decision and bought a lovely apartment with a wondrous view across kalkan bay .
2	i still own the apartment , enjoy holidays out there ( not as often or for as long as i would like unfortunately ) and rent it out during the season .
2	i cannot_fault place overseas in any respect .
2	i was superbly looked after before , during and after my purchase - always considerately and never with any pressure .
2	i cannot recommend cameron and his team ( both in the uk and turkey ) enough .

2	after_searching online for the best price for my new camera , digitalrev . com was by far cheapest .
2	after_reading_reviews to ensure they were a reliable site i tried to order - unfortunately , as the company is based in hong_kong , my bank secure system wouldn_'_t clear the purchase .
2	i tried looking around but nowhere compared - either prices were much higher or reviews terrible .
2	i had to speak to the bank and after a bit of hassle , i eventually got clearance and once this happened i had placed my order and received it within a few_days .
2	while ordering , due to the bank troubles , the order seemed to be placed three_times , then cancelled .
2	however , speaking online with a consultant from digitalrev put me right as to what to do .
2	the consultant was friendly and helpful and the entire shopping_experience with digital_rev was top_class .
2	my camera arrived wrapped safely and i couldn_'_t_believe the speed at which i received it .
2	would definitely recommend this company and would use them again in an_instant .
2	i ordered at nine_o_clock and received my order the very next_day - that doesnt normally happen when delivery is to northern_ireland .
2	boohoo has a great website , great offers , and great products .
2	easy ordering and easy returns .
2	i loved it and will definitely order here again
2	i have used this company twice_now and each time the service has_been excellent .
2	prompt delivery and good quality goods , exactly as_described on their web - site .
2	will definitely be using this company again .
2	the web_site provided the kind of detail that allowed the right choice to be made .
2	prices were competitive and delivery was efficient .
2	goods well_packed .
2	would consider_using this company again for future purposes .
2	i ordered the nikon_d0000 after_reading all the reviews both on digitalrev and other_sites .
2	i was attracted by the price which was considerably_lower_than most .
2	i was slightly_concerned when i realised that the camera was coming from hong_kong but was easily able to track it '_s whereabouts and could see how quickly it made it way to the uk .
2	it prompty arrived on my doorstep and was wrapped extremely well and protected from any knocks it might have had on the way .
2	i '_m still getting used to the camera and have no_reservations_about recommending digitalrev to anyone who is considering buying their next camera on - line .
2	i only received my spex last_week , but so far so good , no_problems !
2	after looking at the details on the website , i felt_reassured that they seem to be an honest , professional company .
2	having had bad_experiences with a couple of other online_retailers , i was a bit_anxious !
2	i am so impressed .
2	i use a lot of ' smellies ' as , apart_from on me , my kids spray their pillows with my perfume so they can feel close to me when they drop_off to sleep .
2	they have always done it and they are now all teenagers !
2	so to get my favourite at such a good price is a true bonus .
2	thanks guys !!!!!
2	!
2	is the reaction i get when i tell people about my " bionic eyes ".
2	before treatment , everytime i dropped anything , i would have to ask my hawk - eye children to find it for me , now , i can see it myself .... brilliant .
2	having been short - sighted for my entire life , i really didnt know what i was missing , i also didnt_realise that it was this that gave_me my migraines , not that cant lift your head off the pillow kind but the flashing_lights and tunnel vision kind - i thought that was tiredness , however , since the treatment , not one episode , which is fabulous , losing my peripheral vision and trying to dodge the flashing_lights whilst operating a pc is not the one !
2	i have to say , being_able to see the world around me is still a novelty , i just love to look around me , seeing " stuff ".
2	it was the first time i have used this website & it was so easy to navigate_around it .
2	i booked my mot for a date & time that suited me .
2	excellent site i will be using it to book all of my mot '_s in the future & will recommend it to everyone i know with a car .
2	ordered the most fabulous bag , received an_email checking delivery address almost immediatley , another a little while later to say it had been dispatched , the bag arrived within less_than 00_hours and was even better_than i thought it would be .
2	great service , great product , would highly_recommend to everyone .
2	i ordered 0 nail_varnishes , and they were with me in exceptional time !
2	great products that i didn_'_t have to wait around for !
2	would recommend !
2	very simple to order , different_sizes of bouquets available
2	i know the free stuff is charged for shipping but still a great deal and gives me the opportunity to try new stuff . i have liked most everything i have tried ...
2	ships fast and good products !!
2	!
2	i ordered a backpack for my son last_year , and a bag and some shoes for myself last_week .
2	both orders were fulfilled quickly and efficiently , no_issues .
2	one of the items i ordered had a special_offer of a free wallet but the code supplied didn_'_t work at the checkout , so i didnt think we would get it .
2	luckily whoever processed the order identified and corrected the problem
2	very good at keeping you informed , delivered when promised , overall great service will use again .
2	this is the 0st time i have ordered my euro online and i must_admit i did have my reservations .
2	i ordered late on a tues_pm and they where delivered 0st thing thurs am and with a higher exchange_rate than i could get on the high_street .
2	i will certainly be using them again .
2	i have purchased two_seperate items from perfume_click , and on both_occasions , i got competitive_prices , smooth_transaction and fast delivery , excellent service
2	i wanted to check out a different kind of ear cleanser for sunny ( my cocker_spaniel ) as the one i use doesn_'_t help him anymore and was spoilt for choice , decided to go for the recommended surosolve .
2	i originally did a search for cavello hoof boot gel pads and they stock them , that '_s a pretty specialist item - very impressed !
2	once again i have been impressed by the swift delivery of my online purchase .
2	if only all of the delivery agencies were this reliable .
2	sammie_taylor was so so so so helpfull
2	very good price and it arrived_safely when it said it would in 0 - 0_days and the follow_up request to say what one thought is not a bad thing
2	had what we needed at a good price .
2	tracked delivery arrived on time with a courteous follow_up email to chcek we had received it .
2	excellent service
2	i didnt know primark had a website till i saw it on here , i just love shopping in primark , great value clothes , brilliant
2	i do my big grocery shop on here nearly every week , good value , and easy to use website
2	i stumbled on this site by_accident , its brilliant i love saving money , doesnt everyone ,
2	brought loads of brilliant value stuff of here , even got an ipod that was like new for a fraction of the price , ok i might just have been very lucky but i love ebay , even started selling on here my self and made a little_bit of a profit , yeah .
2	brilliant offers and prices , great games , fab site , never had any_problems with anything that i have ordered from here
2	my son wanted to buy 0ds with his_birthday money , ordered it may_0000 , like others have said , when they eventually answered an_email kept saying would be despatched in 00_hours , never received anything , very quick to take money out of your account , not so quick at answering the telephone .
2	i am so glad that i had the hindsight to buy it on my visa_card .
2	anyway after over 0_months disappointment , i had had enough and i contacted my bank and had to fill out some forms detailing all my emails and the correspondence i got back from them , and i received refund in full from my bank , we then managed to buy a 0ds much_cheaper with extra games from well_known high_street store .
2	places an order late monday_afternoon and guess_what , it will be here today ( tuesday ).
2	was able to track my parcel all the way .
2	now that '_s what i call fast .
2	highly_recommended for fast delivery .
2	hope the goods will be up to my expectations !!
2	will keep you posted ............
2	i always use shipley when i buy furniture from ebay - they always come up with a number of drivers and i have never had a bad_experience .
2	i ordered a part for my hotpoint_fridge_freezer , it was the right part and it came on time thank_you
2	was very impressed with the speed of delivery and the response when i informed you the dehumidifier was not working .
2	it now works , but one of the reasons i bought it was for the ability of continuous use but we did not get the hose connection , was this included in the price or do we need to buy separately ?
2	i placed my order on line and oakland contacted me almost_immediately to arrange delivery .
2	i also received texts and emails prior to delivery telling my when my cupboard would be delivered .
2	forty_minutes before delivery i was called to say they were on their way .
2	delivery man was very polite and helpful .
2	cupboard is wonderful ; excellent quality at a good price .
2	i couldn_'_t fault the whole_experience and will_definately use oakland again .
2	hi first time i have bought anything from outdoor_kit , i bought online on tuesday 00 : 00_hrs and it arrived at my door at 00 :_00am on thursday_morning , having used many companies online i have to say that i find the delivery service first_class and cheap too , i will definitely use this company again and will also recommend it to all my friends , thanks very much for a great speedy service .
2	best price , and available where others weren_'_t my daughter bought this with her christmas money .
2	it arrived when she expected and was everything she wanted .
2	i made an order for a chair on 00 / 00 / 00 and cancelled it the same evening .
2	since then have sent repeated emails and have had several conversations with people who tell me i can expect a full_refund in a few_days time .
2	having looked into the company further i think the people i spoke to work for another company , and that infurn are a very dodgy set_up .
2	i reported them to the british police for fraud .
2	i since found out several others have dine the same and that they are being investigated .
2	i suggest you think very carefully before parting with any money to this company .
2	buying tapestry wool here in rural sweden is a real pain , so i thought i '_d take a chance and order from stitcher .
2	the wool is great quality , was an excellent price and arrived amazingly quickly .
2	i '_m very pleased and will be back for more .
2	many_thanks .
2	fast delivery , great stuff !
2	easy to use , and very versatile , i need more !
2	i use this company every time i visit lanzarote .
2	great service , great cars .
2	this company is fantastic their customer service is second to none they took the time out to help i just wish all company '_s were as helpful i would recommend to everyone if you are looking for spares you can '_t go_wrong with espares
2	we are 000_% happy with this car_park we have used it a few_times it is always reliable and friendly no matter the time of day or night you check in or out we would defiantly recommend it to anyone
2	i had been put on to this site by friends they were great they got us the cheapest deal friends of ours booked up to go with us a few_days before we went and everything arrived for them the next_day as they do not have the internet so they posted everything out to them
2	i have been vaping for two years_now and have tried a lot of the other_companys , some of the juice has_been dire especially the cheaper stuff .
2	i ordered ry0 from uk - eliquid it arrived first thing the next_morning , the flavour is excellent and i would say it is better_than the dearer brands , the price of products very affordable and a great selection too .
2	even the bottles the juice comes in are so much_easier to use as the nozzles are thinner , i now would never go_anywhere_else , its taken a lot of searching the net for the right company and i have found it .
2	here you have one very pleased customer .
2	the service was brilliant : i was kept_informed all the way , received top_class products at a very reasonable_price .
2	( cheaper_than e_- bay !)
2	will certainly be using again for my various pets_needs and will definitely be recommending to my friends and family .
2	thank_you animed .
2	:)
2	the rates they offer are better_than most others , the service they offer is brilliant , the money was with me the day after i ordered it .
2	it was actually quicker_than i could have got from my bank and at a better rate .
2	i will be using them again .
2	really pleased with our new_cooker .
2	glad we bought from marks_electricals , very pleasant , efficient and seem to be the best prices around ....
2	thanks ... we will do_business again !
2	i am so sick of explaining my problems with bt that i won_'_t bore anyone with the detail .
2	but suffice it to say that i have today spoken to trading_standards and they say i have a case .
2	they have delivered me nothing but headaches peppered with 00 minute fruitless and frustrating calls to their customer helpline , broken_promises and shoddy service .
2	don_'_t do it ... you '_d find doing smoke signals to communicate a lot more efficient .
2	i have been buying from just vitamins for a couple of months .
2	each order has arrived very quickly and i am pleased with the product .
2	i have recommended them to friends who are now also buying from just vitamins .
2	i always find printerland easy to use and very efficient .
2	parcels arrive when they say they will .
2	i recently_moved_house and got some new decking built .
2	i had previously used eitherthe local_diy_store from amazon but a friend recommended wood_finishes direct .
2	i went on to the web_site and could not believe the prices compared to what i had been paying previously , almost_double the size of decking varnish for the same price as a tin half the size .
2	i placed my order and was kept bang up - to - date with the progress of my order and on the day it was due to arrive , got a message giving me the one hour_slot it would arrive in , so no hanging_around all day .
2	my order arrived as promised , within that hour and i couldn_'_t be more pleased with my decision to use this company .
2	i haven_'_t got round to using the product yet due to either bad_weather or lack of time but i know it will be ok as i have used it before .
2	i would recommend anyone looking for any type of product or paint for their fences , decking etc .
2	to get it from this company .
2	totally reliable , hassle_free and punctual !
2	a very good fast and efficient company .
2	they have good value for money products .
2	the web_site is very clear easy to use , no log in , but remembers_your past orders for simple reordering ...... fab .
2	the good arrived very fast and in good order .
2	i highly_recommend this company .
2	i booked several parcels on the same day with different carriers , theough parcel0go .
2	the myhermes man turned_up and insisted on taking a parcel that was not booked through myhermes and which had a tnt label on it .
2	my employee tried to explain , but the driver was insistent to the point of agression that he had to take the parcel .
2	i rang parcel0go within 0 minutes of this , but myhermes did not respond .
2	several days of parcel0go telling_me that " myhermes would not respond within 00_hours " ensued .
2	but myhermes did not respond at all .
2	they then lost my parcel but refused to pay compensation .
2	as a result i lost a valued regular customer .
2	all in all a total disgrace , would never use them again ..
2	easy website to use , straightforward - and super_fast delivery .
2	will definitely use again
2	ordered some magnets , some funky such as thumbs_up and thumbs down and some more standard , small budget hook type ones - they are perfect for what i needed .
2	the website was easy to use and checkout was straight_forward too .
2	delivery was very prompt , so would definitely have no_qualms about using this company again :)
2	very impressed - good , keen_pricing , outstanding service , very prompt delivery - shall definitely use again !
2	:)
2	i had heard about funding_circle many_times but because it wasn_'_t the traditional way to borrow money i was sceptical and dismissed it .
2	one sunday my husband mentioned that he knew someone_who had raised working capital this way and that i should give it a go .
2	the process was simple and extremely quick , i think it took only one week before i was accepted and had the funds in my bank_account .
2	what a fantastic idea !
2	nothing beats this and i would recommend it to anyone .
2	i found out about p0d through money saving_expert . com and was very impressed with the experience .
2	the website was very easy to use and contained lots of helpful guidance about packing your item etc .
2	i selected a service that met my requirements and the item was picked_up next_day and delivered the following .
2	i also saved around 00_% compared to using parcelforce .
2	my only ( slight ) quibble was that the quick links in the confirmation_email didn_'_t appear to work but overall the customer experience was excellent and i '_d recommend p0d to anyone .
2	products from trusted quality brands , processed & delivered efficiently & at reasonable cost .
2	ordered late tuesday night with request for ringback - call returned just after 0 : 00 wednesday .
2	knowledgeable first - hand advice given on suitability of varier variable kneeling chair for my size , and time - saving tips on assembly .
2	advised on thursday of despatch of chair with backrest to follow when back in stock .
2	friday_morning am sitting comfortably on my new chair to write this ( couldn_'_t wait for the backrest to try it , very easy to assemble so don_'_t mind doing it again !)
2	many_thanks to emma & abi in the london store .
2	looking for cheap but full cover insurance for a few_days , couldn_'_t ask for a better service
2	i was so impressed with the text_messages letting_me know the flowers were getting delivered , and then a text to say they had been successfully delivered to my sister .
2	many_thanks i will defiantly use your service again .
2	bought 0 outdoor fur effect led reindeer which arrived really quickly .
2	although a little fiddly to assemble and to get the head out of the body , they look really good once put_together .
2	there were plenty of ties to keep parts together .
2	they even came with a free battery_operated reindeer which is hyper - kitch , but kept the dog amused .
2	they were well_packaged and the price wasn_'_t too bad , ' though would have bought a 0rd one had they been closer to £_00 each .
2	delivery of goods was speedy and the items purchased exactly_what i needed for my son '_s cricket this season .
2	will be returning !
2	having purchased a multi player hifi syestem from hifi_tower last_year it has_been a great product , unfortunatly the cd_player developed a problem , after_contacting the sales suport team they imediatly replied even_though it was the weekend period , they even sent a prepaid_label for the product to be returned .
2	fantastic promt and efficient after sales service , very rare_these days !
2	i highly_recommend hifi_tower and will_definatly recommend and use them again .
2	geoff evans .
2	uk .
2	i have been very impressed by the service , product and delivery for the last two orders i have placed recently .
2	the strips have arrived a day or so after ordering and have been really well_packaged .
2	i would use this company again ,
2	thanks
2	elaine
2	i ordered the item on monday and it arrived on wednesday .
2	it was well_packaged .
2	i have not been able to source the item locally and had been trying for a while to get_hold of it .

2	easy and quick no_problems booking hostel
2	good description anf brilliant price would use them again
2	ordered late friday_afternoon arrived at work monday_morning .
2	i used this site last_year and found they offered excellent exchange_rates .
2	the service was superb and i will definitely use them again and again .
2	i hadn_'_t used blackcircle before , but i '_ll definitely be using them again .
2	i checked out the web_site first which was very informative , but i prefer personal contact when i '_m ordering things so i called the company instead .
2	the sales_adviser was brilliant - friendly , polite and extremely knowledgeable and best of all wasn_'_t ' pushy '.
2	the pricing was simple - price given included everything so there were no little hidden_extras and was cheaper_than others i had checked out .
2	i was able to choose the garage and time and they confirmed all the details by email .
2	the staff at the garage - fast fit , kingston , were great .
2	their waiting room is warm , clean and comfortable and what '_s more i got to help myself to fresh tea and biscuits for free - definitely a welcome_bonus on a freezing_cold day .
2	would i recommend them to anyone_else ?
2	yes !
2	not being a lover of internet_shopping i was a little_nervous when my son wanted to purchase his expensive birthday_present on - line .
2	being a good parent i did my homework on the company before giving him the go - ahead .
2	i needn_'_t have worried - they were brilliant !
2	the system checked out his chosen specification to confirm it would all work before allowing him to place his order and then we received emails_informing us of each_step his computer was going through .
2	however , because i hadn_'_t read the delivery time properly , i hadn_'_t realised it was given in working_days which_meant it wouldn_'_t arrive in time for his_birthday .
2	i called customer_services and asked if they could help speed up the process and the member of staff was extremely polite and very helpful .
2	he said , he would do his best but couldn_'_t guarantee anything but would at_least try and get it to despatch the day before i needed it .
2	imagine how exited i was when i received notification that dhl would deliver it not 0 , but 0_days before his_birthday .
2	the computer is ' awesome ' and my son is extremely happy .
2	my life is now so much more peaceful - thankyou pcspecialists :_d :_d
2	i booked my transfer online which was very simple and easy to do , all confirmations were e_mailed to me straight_away .
2	on arrival at antalya airport after collecting our_luggage , our driver was waiting for us with a clear sign with my name on it .
2	he took our_luggage to the very spacious car which was air_conditioned and very clean .
2	transfer to our hotel in lara beach took about 00_minutes .
2	on departure day , i was a bit_worried in case a driver may not turn_up , but he was there 0 minutes early and we received the same assistance .
2	first time i have booked a diy holiday without a transfer included and i would highly_reccommend them and they were the cheapest transfer on line with lots of good comments from tripadvisor and friends .
2	thank_you
2	very pleased with transferwise .
2	have used them a couple of times and i am impressed with their efficiency .
2	the rate given was very competitive and i saved money by using them instead of doing a bank_transfer .
2	i would highly_recommend them .
2	purchased this ham carving_knife as it seemed very good value for money .
2	it arrived really quickly and i am very pleased with the quality .
2	i would definitely purchase from pro - cook again and highly_recommend the site .
2	have used stressfreeparking several_times in the past and have always been very pleased with the service i received .
2	this time when i got my car home and unloaded my luggage i went to put the folded - down seats back up and was a bit upset to find that someone had decided to put the seatbelts into the locks and this caused huge ridges in my seats .
2	why would this need to be done ?
2	was my car used ?
2	ordered a dakine heli pack rucksack as a gift for my son .
2	the goods arrived very quickly and were received in tip_top condition .
2	the price was better_than a couple of rival_companies so i would definitely recommend blackleaf . com to everyone i know .
2	it was a pleasure_doing_business .
2	loveley site any one can join excellent prize money had a few gd wins cms are helpfull i love it
2	i ordered the personalised whisky_miniatures for my parents_diamond_anniversary , they arrived very quicky , i was very impressed and even more surprised that they had upgraded to a malt_whisky at no extra_cost .
2	fantastic site and would definitely recommend to anyone .
2	tha . nk you
2	great site , speedy delivery .
2	birds_love the robin mix even the squirrels !!!
2	!
2	started to use this company to buy pointer sticks .
2	i was previously buying them in singles from my local_pet shop but this was running very expensive and couldn_'_t get to the shop that often either .
2	decided to buy a box from this company and wouldn_'_t buy them from anyone_else now .
2	their delivery is free , they turn_up within 0_days of ordering them so my dogs always have their supply .
2	very pleased .
2	if you ' re thinking of tracing your family history but think it may be very complicated , think again .
2	i '_ve been researching my family tree for a few_years_now and have not only found some very interesting ancestors but have also found a cousin in australia who happened to be tracing her family tree also .
2	the ancestry site gives you access to other members trees to help in your search and we found each other that way and are now in frequent contact outside of the website .
2	yes you can hit some brick walls and reach some very frustrating dead ends with some lines of your ancestors records and i know that ancestry . com would find them for me if they were available so always feel satisfied that i can go no further with a particular line .
2	so when a ' shaky leaf ' appears in the right hand corner of a family_member i '_m researching my heart skips a beat .
2	that shaky leaf can mean a document , another family tree to look at , a record of birth , marraige , death or probate and even a photo .
2	what ever comes from your research really brings your ancestors to life , gives them an identity if you like and when you see what some did for a living and how hard they must '_ve worked really makes you appreciate them , after all , without them we wouldn_'_t be here .
2	they were helpful , polite considerate i was unorganised rushed order throufh had within 0 working_days ty
2	shoes were brilliant my daughter will love them , now she knows the sight great value
2	a very good helpful order , and fast good delivery thanks

2	the site was easy to use , and had lots of choice , which is not alwyas the case with online florists .
2	the tracking was really useful and the flowers arrived in perfect_condition , having been very well_packed and transited .
2	my neice sent a photo of them so i could see for myself and they really were gorgeous , not quite in full_bloom , but hinting at it and not one flower was in less_than perfect_condition .

2	i had 0 demands for 000_quid !!!
2	i was desperate .
2	i had only the postcodes of pick_up and drop_off and a date ... no code ... no special number ... no email_confirmation ... as i wasn_'_t sure which email i had used .
2	nightmare .
2	had a dismal few_days .
2	until i chatted to [_name_] this sunday_evening online .

2	i liked the goods as soon as i saw them .
2	smart looking and obvious good quality .
2	the price was keen too .
2	yes i liked them and i would recommend to a friend .
2	i already have .
2	cheers good stuff .
2	i like my new handles .
2	i have arthritis and they feel so smooth and easy to use and best of all they look good .
2	hubby liked the price and quality too .

2	good all_round , buy them .
2	first time we have ordered medication on line .
2	couldn_'_t have been easier .
2	the order was sent out same day as prescription faxed and we received the order the very next_day .
2	the cost of the medication was a third of the price of what the vet_charges were and as sam will require this long_term the saving will be enormous .
2	would recommend medicines0pets to friends .
2	i decided to take the plunge and buy some new glasses from this company as my old ones were getting a bit scratched up .
2	i liked the wide_choice of frames available and the precise measurements given for each frame .
2	it meant i could measure my old frames and pick new ones that were almost the same size , so i knew they would fit without adjustment .
2	i received my new glasses within a week .
2	they are very comfortable and i have saved almost £_000 ( my old glasses came from a well_known high_street retailer and cost me over_£_000 as i need 0 . 00 index_lenses to keep weight and thickness down ).
2	i will be ordering another pair in the new year .
2	thanks for an excellent service .
2	this is an_email that i sent to oak_furnitureland .
2	“ dear all
2	in this day and age of such bad " customer service " i would like to congratulate your firm on such good " customer service ".
2	from the salesman at your hull store who was friendly and informative ( but not pushy ) to the phone_calls , emails and texts_keeping_me informed of the delivery date of my table and chairs ( which was sooner then expected !

2	i give them 00 / 00 with no_hesitation !
2	very good service from the internet company .
2	the delivery was rubbish , told it would be delivery between 0 . 00 and 00 . 00 arrived after quering at 00 . 00 .

2	well_done wetsuitoutlet .

2	once signed_up for quidco there is really only one hard part .
2	that '_s changing your habits and remembering to go through the quidco website first .
2	but there are several levels that you can earn .
2	if you use the auction web_site and after your purchase quidco sends an_email_saying you have earn '_t ... pennies .
2	it doesn_'_t seem worth it but then you get your payment email and get a pleasant_surprise at the total .
2	as they say " look after the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves ".
2	highly_recommend .
2	thanks
2	quidco
2	it '_s cheaper_than royal_mail , they collect from your door or a safe_place you have given , and ...... you can pay by pay_pal ...... and you can track the parcel and know when it has_been delivered .
2	and you get to know your collector . you can '_t get better_than that
2	i got a prescription from our vet for optimune for pepper .
2	i found animed on the web and it was so much_cheaper to buy from them .
2	pepper our dog has to have this 0x a day for the rest of her life .
2	she is not insured anymore so it is so exspensive going to the vet for it .
2	you just register your pet .
2	order the product if it is prescription only , you have to upload or send it to them .
2	once approved you pay and in a couple of days it arrives .
2	very good service and well_worth a look at .

2	very fast and efficient service
2	i was extremely happy with the service and accuracy of my online shopping_experience with tesco .
2	the driver was more than helpful and its great to save fuel costs
2	ultimate_appliances must be the worst internet based company i have ever had the misfortune to encounter .
2	they delivered the item late , to the wrong_address and when re - scheduled , i travelled 000_miles to receive the item , which they were fully_aware of and they then decided they would not deliver at all .
2	it is now some 0_weeks and i am still_waiting for a refund .
2	this matter has now been placed into the hands of my solicitor and trading_standards .
2	i have now been contacted my numerous other ultimate appliance customers who all have similar stories to tell .
2	bbc rogue traders have now taken up this case - to date i have been contacted by no less_than 00 dissatisfied_customers who have lodged formal complaints against [_name_removed_] the managing_director of ultimate_appliances .
2	if anyone_else has similarly suffered , please dont hesitate to get in contact with me .
2	subsequent to my post i have received a threat of legal_action by the managing_director of this company in which he has attempted to intimidate me into silence .
2	i will not be silenced .
2	the facts are irrefutable .
2	anyone_wishing to purchase from this retailer , should contact all of those customers who '_s reviews have been removed - contact trust_pilot to ask for the list .
2	the majority of them will be willing to share their experiences which have been extremely negative .
2	do your homework before buying from these people .
2	i ended_up buying from john_lewis who were exceptional and i would never hesitate to use them in the future
2	my dragonfly solar_lights look lovely during the day with their brightly_coloured wings , then at dusk they shine really bright helping to illuminate the waterfall .
2	want to buy something online from anywhere in the world , but unsure how to pay ?
2	use paypal !
2	all you need is the sellers email address , pay in the currency of the country you ' re buying from , paypal will give you the current currency_exchange_rate ,
2	if you have any_problems with the seller , paypal offer buyer_protection , and you can claim your money back within 00 days .
2	i wanted to get the food for free books .
2	we love the idea of self sufficiency and got the books to find out how easy it is .
2	it really is easy !
2	there is so much wild food that is free to pick & use .
2	did you know that if you are in the vehicle behind one that hits a pheasant .
2	deer or rabbit ?
2	- you are entitled to pick it up for your_own use .
2	i did !
2	i picked_up a lovely fresh road kill pheasant which along with young nettles ( taste like spinach ) & wild garlic with home grown potatoes was really tasty .
2	total_cost approximately 0 . 00p for the seed_potatoes .
2	buy now pay later with small weekly payments & easy terms ..
2	i love the fact that i get 00_% commission on everything that is bought by myself & friends .
2	i just let it accumulate and save up for something i would like but can_afford straight_away .
2	at the moment i '_m saving my commission for carpets for our new house .
2	the first place i look when needing anything for my home , friends , family or pets .
2	our last major purchases on ebay were a new car for me & motorbike for him .
2	things we '_ve bought at bargain prices , leather rise / recline electric chair , rise / recline electric bed , single solid pine bed_frame , shoes , boots , clothing for both of us , rugs , heavy curtains & nets .
2	honestly , if you want something check ebay first .
2	always check the sellers feedback , if there are too many negative_comments ( in red ) don_'_t touch them .
2	if you ' re looking for a usually high priced item x - box , flat screen tv , blu - ray video and find it for silly money .
2	remember if it seems too good to be true , it usually is !
2	read the whole auction page , or you could end up with just the box they came in !
2	i needed to get some frontline fast .
2	i have four_cats , two of them have severe flea allergies .
2	medicanimal despatched the day the order was placed and it arrived at my door 0_days_later .
2	that to me is perfect service !
2	a friend asked where i was getting my frontline , so i suggested medicanimal and told them about the good quality of service , they asked me to order some for their dog and got the same quick despatch & delivery .
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending medicanimal to all of my friends .
2	this amazing procedure , clarivu total vision correction has completely changed my whole life for the better .
2	i have so much more confidence in my every day life , driving on the motorway , going shopping , swimming , computer work , i feel a weight has_been lifted off my shoulders .
2	this was the best decision i have ever made i '_m free again just like when i was a teenager .
2	how can i ever thank_you optegra .
2	if i only knew years_ago how my life could change overnight , all my frustrations and anxieties with my sight would have disappeared long before now .
2	it is all down to my eye_surgeon mr_morris and his exceptional team at optegra .
2	from the time i walked_into their whiteley hospital i felt relaxed and at ease .
2	the whole_experience was amazing .
2	i had refractive lens exchange surgery and since then i can see the smallest_detail - for example my husband took me to buy a diamond_ring and i noticed a flaw in one diamond and the assistant was amazed that i could see it with my naked_eye .
2	she said she could see nothing wrong with it herself but when she inspected it with her eyeglass , she was amazed to find out that i had , indeed , spotted an imperfection in the stone !
2	my eyes are now as good as when i was sixteen .
2	before the surgery i could not drive on the motorway anymore due to my lack of confidence in my vision , even_though i had tried contact_lenses ( varifocals ) but now there is no stopping me !
2	!
2	once , on my fiftieth birthday , whilst in a lift in a times square , new_york hotel , i was fumbling around in my handbag looking for my dreaded glasses , because i could not read the instructions to operate the lift .
2	when the lift suddenly shut_down due to the length of time i had taken in looking for them , i was stuck for twenty horrendous minutes in complete darkness .
2	it was then that i decided that i would do something to improve my vision !
2	i am certainly glad that i was pointed in the direction of optegra otherwise i would be having_difficulty in writing this review and probably still fumbling around in the dark !
2	!
2	anybody who is undecided about whether to have this procedure done - do not waste valuable time with indecisiveness as you will miss out on the most_important things in life .
2	i would like to stand on top of the roof of that hotel in times square and shout to the world how wonderful i feel today and it '_s all thanks to optegra and especially mr_morris !
2	o0 own this company and think its a great business plan to provide a service hiding_behind a new name " giffgaff " where they get the actual customer to provide all the support .
2	if you think that is great then blimey :-)
2	followed there instructions on how to unlock my iphone and what a shock it meant i had to take it to apple for a replacement .
2	avoid !
2	i have been using travel_republic for many_years , for flights or package holidays , and ( as yet ) have never had a problem with them , they offer the cheapest prices so i do not even shop around on line with other travel sites , as i know i will get the best deal possible with travel_republic .
2	have recommended them to many of my friends and family .
2	i have used serenataflowers twice_now , and it is so easy , just sit back in your_own_home and order , they kept me informed about the progress of my flowers , and when they were delivered , the prices are good too , i would definatly recommend them to everyone , they have not let_me down at all .
2	the perfume and aftershave i was looking for was well out of my price range , until i discovered cheapsmells , now i am the proud_owner of somethings i never thought i would have .
2	i was delighted with the price of the product i wanted to buy , with free delivery too , i received an_email_telling_me when it was to be delivered , and an_hour_slot of the actual time it would be delivered , it arrived within ten_minutes of the allotted_time .
2	best price on the web and fastest delivery ever .
2	i '_ve been with quidco for a few_years_now and never had any negative issues .
2	i have recommended it to my family and friends and they love it too .
2	nothing to lose so give it a go !
2	second year running we have used jet0 and have no_complaints at all .
2	in fact with two of our party being taller_than average we were delighted with the amount of leg_room we had on our flight to venice this year .
2	no delays and friendly staff helped to make our holiday great .
2	by far the cheapest price on the net for purina dog_food and with delivery withing two_days i would rate this site very highly .
2	the card we were handed with details of what to do on our return was really helpful .
2	i would say it was a prompt and efficient service which delivered on what we booked .
2	ordered some new ghd '_s for my daughter as she had her bag stolen with them in .
2	as you can_imagine she was mortified so i went on to the website , ordered them and they arrived very promptly much to my daughter '_s delight .
2	condidering i ordered these over the new year period they still arrived very quickly - thank_you very much ghd and will certainly recommend your website and service .
2	i first booked with love holidays last_year and was keeping my fingers_crossed that everything would be ok , i think everyone is always a bit_dubious when they try out a new company .
2	the booking process is so easy and if you are unsure_about anything you can live_chat with them which is brilliant .
2	our holiday to egypt last_year was absolutely great we had no_problems what so ever . i have already booked my holiday for 0000 and to make things even easier you can now pay for it monthly of which i have done so there is no struggle to pay for it .
2	i would definately recommend love holidays to anyone .
2	my daughter also booked with them last_year after i told her about them
2	oh and the prices are extremely competitve too .
2	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend this company to anyone .
2	i ordered a mattress early_afternoon on the thursday and it was delivered by 0pm the next_day - fantastic .
2	the prices are really good too , i ordered a single standard mattress and am very impressed with the quality considering the price i paid .
2	i will definitely be a returning_customer when the time comes .
2	thank_you for the brilliant service :-)
2	easy to order and very quick delivery - thanks
2	the service was prompt and just as it says on the tin !!!
2	excellent service and would use again .
2	i have been a keen user of ebay for several_years_now , both as a buyer and seller .
2	the system is easy to use , and the assistance offered in all areas is fantastic .
2	i cannot imagine using any other online auction_site .
2	this company offers great prices on high_quality products ,
2	very quick delivery , and excellent service .
2	would recommend
2	to anyone , and will definitely be using again .
2	i am a great fan of lovingthebead , great service , gorgeous beads ,
2	excellent value for money .
2	have used the savewatersavemoney website for quite a while and have ordered various products .
2	not only does this site give you enormous benefits for how to save money and water , but allows the household to order water_saving devices .
2	we have used 0 of the products and can most definitely attest to the fact that we have saved money on our monthly_bill .
2	well_done swsm !
2	find the enewsletters fun , newsy and love to see what deals are on
2	loved the delivery , the letter and the ' head up ' on delivery time !
2	innovative , friendly , efficient service and products that really are a ' cut above ' the rest !
2	i needed usd and got best rate and very fast service - thank_you
2	i was amazed_at the speed of delivery , and it is also lovely to be greeted_by a smiling_face and friendly attitude when you open the door .
2	a great service , thank_you .
2	the website is easy to use and i found the batteries i wanted quickly .
2	they arrived very fast and well_packaged , all_round good service .
2	it was easy to find what i wanted , and the delivery was quick , the only problem was that it was a surprise for my husband and the parcel arrived in its own box , not wrapped , and he signed for it , so it was a surprise no_longer .
2	good service and lovely products
2	pets0homes is a great website to use , whether you are looking for a new pet or selling a litter .
2	it is really easy to set_up an account and if you just want to browse the listings you don_'_t need an account .
2	other pet sites charge users a joining fee to see telephone_numbers but pets0homes is free .
2	you can have an unlimited amount of photos with an ad which is great .
2	it is also really easy to refresh your ad so it goes straight to the top of the listings .
2	i feel pets0homes is the most_popular website in the uk for people searching for a pet .
2	for this reason it would always be my first choice of pet website to go to .
2	i wanted to personally thank_you for the great job you guys did at photography during the womaa world martial games xii in wales .
2	the screen is a little smaller_than my previous but this model has a usb outlet and a minute digital arial which is great .
2	have used parcel_hero on a few occasions now and they are the best courier company i have ever used .
2	parcels are collected when they say they will be and delivered undamaged to their destination when they should be .
2	sounds simple but having used other courier companies in the past i could write a book on what can go_wrong .
2	definitely a permanent customer here and i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend them .
2	not very happy with the service .
2	tried to cancel greeting_card the day after l put my order in , but was not allowed .
2	i cannot_believe they used a courier to deliver the flowers , if l had known that l would have used interflora .
2	i sent my mobileone day and then the very next_day i got my cheque .
2	i had ordered this apparatus for mother but realised i had chosen the wrong one . gormless that i am at times . mother said i had got it wrong again so i called the complete_care shop hotline and a very nice chapee did all the changing for me and it was sorted and next_day yes the next_day mother received her wheeled trolley frame thingee .
2	such a realistic price and really great quality .
2	doesn_'_t always go hand in hand in this day and age but have now found a company that gives both so when the gongs are being given out this lot can stand on the middle podium !
2	0 ***** number 0 .
2	gold_medal .
2	yeah !
2	i needed a huge bin at a cheap price to put all our camp kitchen gear in and browsing i came_across this company .
2	wow great deals and just what i needed and cheap . faster_than fast delivery excellent quality and so well_packaged . they deserve more than 0_* s for their speed service and quality .
2	i found the product easily , ordered and was very pleased to receive it in a few_days . as a disabled_person_who finds trawling the high_street near on impossible it was with relief that i found this site .
2	00 / 00 or 0_* whichever they prefer the firm is brilliant . many_thanks go to their speed discretion and understanding .
2	i ordered flowers for a friend , who received them the next_day and was delighted .
2	i recently had a quote from a leading fitted wardrobe company , which was really over the top and they said they could not fit glass_doors in our angled roof .
2	with the help from slidingwardrobe world , we purchased and fitted the glass sliding_doors for a fraction of the cost .
2	delivery was when promised , and our queries were answered_promptly and help and advice given readily .
2	i would not_hesitate to recommend this company to others .
2	the young_man i gave my order to was very helpful .
2	the goods arrived when promised , despite_being just before christmas .
2	i would use gardensite again
2	i ordered a new canon_0d camera which was the best price i could find .
2	on top of that i got another 0 %_off for paying by bank_transfer .
2	i ordered on friday 00th , made the transfer on sunday 00th and had my camera by wednesday 00st .
2	at all times i was kept_informed of progress by email .
2	what wonderful service :-) highly_recommended and i will buy from them again .
2	the service was excellent with no_hassle , driver waiting for us on arrival , polite and helpful .
2	return trip on time and driver again polite and helpful .
2	will use the company again .
2	musclefiness hold a great stock of products , sold at unbeatable prices and delivery just could not be any quicker .
2	well_done the whole musclefinesse team .
2	housenetwork worked very efficiently and kept us informed all the way through the selling process .
2	we greatly_appreciated the help we received from our agent , kayleigh , especially when one offer on the house fell through .
2	she was most understanding and supportive in what was a very traumatic_experience .
2	hard to find supplements at best prices around .
2	always in stock .
2	i placed an order on saturday for 0xbasin taps !
2	being a typical female i did not , at the time , realise that basin and bath_taps are different !
2	not wishing the wrong taps being sent , i immediately called these people on the first working day after the order , ie yesterday mon 0 dec .
2	these people are impossible to reach on the phone , and calling an 0000 number from a mobile and holding on for 00 - 00 minute stretches at a time costs a fortune !
2	i eventually gave up on the after sales_team and decided to speak to the sales_team who miraculously answered the phone immediately !
2	funny that !!
2	!
2	when the guy_who answered realised i had a query and was not placing an order he curtly told me he could not help and that he would put me on hold and i should dial 0 or 0 and speak to someone !
2	but nobody answers just a message_saying all they are experiencing unusual high call volumns ( hardly surprisiing since this company seems to want to take money but provide nothing else )!!!
2	so i sent a message via their contact form on the website not realising i would have to wait 00_hours for a reply !
2	i did eventually speak to someone , explained my problem and they could not or would not swap the order and take the additional small_fee , so i asked them to cancel the order to which the woman i spoke to said she would do so .
2	not really trusting her less_than enthusiastic assistance , i asked for confirmation in writing !
2	around 0 : 00 yesterday evening when i had not seen a cancellation confirmation i emailed them , to which no reply !
2	no surprise there then - another example of this companies substandard attitude_towards customer_care !!
2	!
2	imagine my surprise when , low and behold , i did receive an_email from them , but only to happily inform_me that the taps i had asked them to cancel has_been despatched !!!
2	to say that i am fuming is putting it mildly !!
2	!
2	if i had a positive , whether you want a product or not , it does at_least turn_up fast !!!
2	the damn taps arrived at 0 :_00am this morning , and i have handed them straight back to the driver to be returned to this trueshopping !!
2	!
2	i now envisage a fight getting a prompt refund !!!
2	if i have not received a full_refund by close of business friday 00th_december , then i reserve the right to take this matter to trading_standards , which or even watchdog !
2	if they can debit my account with speed and efficiency , then they can credit the money back with the same speed and effciency !!!
2	!
2	yes i made a genuine error in assuming basin and bath_taps are one and the same , but this companies entire attitude and lack of due dilligence and care is appalling !
2	honestly , i have never come_across any organization who has such a total disregard towards its customers !!!
2	funny though how their sales_department phone line is never busy !!!
2	!
2	nutshell - avoid this company !
2	----
2	postscript : i have just taken the time to read through the various complaints concerning this company , in the main its lack of customer service , i have gone quite a way back ... time and again the replies that all these people who have left a review have received from trueshopping is the same it is clearly a bog_standard copy / paste type of reply : and it reads :
2	" i sincerely apologise for the lack of response from our customer service team .
2	i can_assure you that this is not usual practice for us and is purely due to a high_volume of emails and calls being received at present .
2	we are working on rectifying this ."
2	how long does it take to " rectify " the lack of response from the customer service team !!
2	clearly from what i can see their lack of customer service , lack of answering phones , answering emails is their usual practice !!!
2	!
2	i was extremely impressed with the speed from placing my order to receiving my item !
2	would definitey use the services again !
2	ecco_shop eu is brilliant , the service is so quick and efficient .
2	i have a back and hip problem and good shoes are a must , the sale is genuine , and to be able to purchase wonderful shoes of such good quality at half price is amazing .
2	thank_you ecco !
2	!
2	well , i know it is nearly christmas but i placed an order on 00th_dec . it was not dispatched until 00rd .
2	dec . and obviously i do not have it yet .
2	i will not receive this until well after the new year i guess ---- less expensive but too long in delivery -- this is a supplement i need to take regularly for a health issue .
2	interestingly the payment was taken immediately from my card --- not good enough i think !
2	!
2	the website was easy to navigate , with plenty of choices and offers to suit .
2	payment processing was smooth and uneventful and delivery was quick and efficient .
2	i recently bought a product to act against crawling insects .
2	the items were sent immediately and have worked well .
2	a good service .
2	i would buy again from this company .
2	i placed two orders and both arrived very quickly , competitive price ( best on internet_search ).
2	so easy to use and quick , reasonable_price and delivered as promised
2	i paid for a christian_dior watch on 00nd_november_0000 for a birthday_present .
2	as i hadn_'_t heard_anything by 00th_december i contacted darren reay and was informed he had a throat infection .
2	the next excuse was a massive snowfall on the east_coast of usa , then his supplier was in hospital , followed_by the only watch available had a diamond missing .
2	the final excuse on 00st_january_0000 of darren losing his voice meant i asked for my money back to be told i should contact my card_issuer and get them to do a chargeback .
2	initially i was dubious_about buying a luxury watch on - line after being let_down by darren reay watches .
2	however , once i spoke to kieran at watchfinder not only was he reassuring but very knowledgeable and understanding .
2	we agreed on a price for a christian_dior watch and as promised it arrived in pristine_condition the very next_day by 00am .
2	it is the most exquisite item of jewellery i have seen and made even more special by the personal and honest assistance of watchfinder .
2	my mum really loved her flowers , but i would have preferred for there not to have been any lillies amongst them , they are very lovely looking flowers , but the smell from them is terrible , but would use this florest again .
2	cant_fault the way my sale was dealt_with response via_e_- mail was almost_instant paperwork and posting bag arrived a day or so later .
2	argos_voucher recieved within 0_days of me sending my old phone to them .
2	well_done
2	i find your company to be fast on delivery with excellent products that do as stated .
2	non_slip gloves my son ordered , good quality for the price , were received 0_days from ordering , no_problems
2	easy to set_up and very quick
2	what can i say , this is the second delivery of this chocolate , we have even had the strawberry ones and it is beautiful .
2	cant_fault the time they take to be delivered as well
2	took my phone into the branch for repair , two_weeks_later not heard_anything - asst manager told me it was still in for repair .
2	week_later i went back , another staff_member admitted the phone was left out the back and only sent off a day ago .
2	manager refused to see me and was told nothing the branch could do .
2	complained through main website and received response stating it was an internal matter and they don_'_t have to let_me know what_happens .
2	they take your money , they make_mistakes , they have no morals or sense of customer service and they would lie to get away with it .
2	dont shop at the carphonewarehouse !
2	i '_ve ordered a few things from deramores and i can truly say that the quality , price and service cannot be_bettered .
2	the site is clear and easy to use , the quality of the items is first_class and delivery is really quick .
2	well_done , you '_ll get years of custom from me !
2	!
2	what more can anyone want !
2	placed an order for a quad_bike before christmas and was informed that it would probably arrive on the 00nd or 00rd_dec but if not , definitely on the 00th .
2	we ' re still_waiting !
2	according to my online a /_c it was dispatched on the 00th_jan despite me cancelling the order on the 00th .
2	it never arrived .
2	i have phoned every day since the 00nd_dec only to be told they are closed , have emailed and left messages on the website .
2	nobody has contacted me at all .
2	for an order of nearly_£_000 you would think they '_d make an effort .
2	i disputed the payment with my credit_card company who have now refunded my account .
2	definitely not recommending this company !!
2	!
2	i only have ordered two items and must_say i am very well pleased with the quailty and designs .
2	i will be shopping here again in the very near_future .. mrs jacqueline griffin
2	brillant company for photobooks .
2	got fed_up with mine being in shoes boxes , at_least now the favourites are all in photobooks it makes them easier to view .
2	great quality and so much versitiliaty in how you can present your_own photos in the book , you can add your_own stamp to them .
2	i have used cewe photworld for the last 0 - 0 years_now and have never been dissappointed with my books .
2	my daughter has all her items labelled with your items and they are perfect !
2	the order process was straight_forward and quick and the price was one of the best on the web .

2	i purchased two items from viovet for my tiger cairn terrier which did not prove suitable however , he damaged one item whilst it was being tried .
2	i telephoned viovet to explain and , as requested , returned the item with a covering_letter .
2	to my surprise and delight i was given a full credit .
2	this level of service and courtesy is superb especially in today '_s economic_climate .
2	i immediately placed a further order and will_continue to do so as the prices and service far exceed my expectations .
2	many_thanks .
2	there '_s a saying that goes " you get what you pay for ", but i '_m pleased to report that gear0music have blown that one right out of the water .
2	i ordered a deluxe single cutaway electro acoustic_guitar ( in willow ) by gear0music this week .
2	it looked good in the photos and the reviews were positive , and so i thought it was worth a try at just short of £_00 .
2	the delivery date was expected to be middle of next week , so it was a great surprise when it actually arrived today ( saturday ) via the trusty yodel delivery man .
2	so , four days early , i took it out of the box ... and lost my breath .
2	what an absolutely g - o - r - g - e_- o - u - s instrument , and the build quality is terrific .
2	so i tuned it up quickly with the onboard tuner , and then a five minute strum turned into a half - hour workout because i just couldn_'_t put it down .
2	i '_ve not had chance to try it out in ' amped - up ' mode yet , but my hopes are more than high for that now .
2	so no , i didn_'_t get what i paid for : i paid for what i thought would be an acceptable , entry - level acoustic_guitar that i could leave propped_up in the living_room and play when i felt the urge .
2	what i actually got was one that is so good , plays so well and looks so striking , that i '_m actually going to use it as my main guitar when gigging .
2	i don_'_t know how gear0music do it for the price , and i don_'_t know which country it was made in , but i '_d like to say a huge thank_you to all those involved in putting this guitar in my possession .
2	and no , i '_m not a g0m employee .
2	i '_m just your average singer - songwriter who_wants to put others onto a good thing when he_sees one .
2	i recommend animed as they are reliable trustworthy and are cheaper_than the vets for the same things .
2	bought the hoody , ordered at 0pm arrived at 0 . 00am next_day , love the free pin badge as well , this is online shopping as it should be .
2	very pleased with customer service .
2	thank_you
2	good value next_day delivery
2	absolutely great they have everything you need to learn and take up a new_hobby .
2	have been using northern_parrots for the supply of my ' little monsters ' supplies for quite some time - i '_ve never had a need to return anything as service , products and delivery are always excellent .
2	this time unfortunately i had to return a cage i had ordered as it was damaged - service & collection was swift & refund processed quickly - again can '_t fault the service - always excellent ...
2	unfortunately the replacement / new order cage also arrived damaged - the matter was resolved quickly by northern_parrots ( thanks to peter and kim ) with the collection of the damaged item and replacement sorted on the same day - excellent - cannot_fault excellent service .
2	was amazed_how easy the ordering process was .
2	i got to choose my delivery date and was sent e_- mail and text_updates and also received phone_calls confirming the date and 0 hour time_slot .
2	really appreciated the on - line videos reviewing the goods .
2	lots of customer reviews to refer to as well .
2	i would definitely order from ao . com again and would recommend other people to do the same .
2	i have used trip_advisor both as a reviewer and visitor for a few_years_now and have always found it a very useful - and easy to use - resource .
2	when visiting a new place , it is excellent to find local restaurants , bars etc and it takes a lot of the guesswork out of trying a new venue .
2	for example , last_year when my husband and i visited nice , we found a wonderful restaurant in the next street to our hotel which we would have missed otherwise .
2	turned_out it was # 0 in nice and deservedly so .
2	i write_reviews on places as soon as i can after visiting them and am always amazed_at how quickly the number of views and helpful votes appear .
2	just shows how widely used it it .
2	i intend to continue using trip_advisor as long as i can to help , and be helped by , it !
2	i am proud to be a member of the trip_advisor family !
2	joy
2	hey i just recycled my old i phone even_though it was faulty i got a good recycle price and was handled fast and efficiently will definitely use again in the future
2	great service as always , next_day delivery ... what more could you ask for ?
2	well_done .
2	couldn_'_t fault anything .
2	item arrived the next_day with free delivery .
2	we needed to return it unfortunately as too small .
2	the returns process was free and very convenient and straightforward .
2	communication was great and our refund was processed immediately .
2	can '_t recommend uttings highly_enough .
2	i was treated really good offered coffee and got talked_through my mot by robert mathews great guy great service have used this garage for years and will_continue to do so !!
2	!
2	this is my first experience of having to return something i bought on line .
2	i was in a panic and thought how am i going to get it to the recipient .
2	the recipient told me to go on to parcel0go website which i did and there is a provision for a live_chat .
2	the lady , danielle , was so helpful , it was such a pleasure communicating with her .
2	i instantly relaxed , as me and my husband were flapping about returning our parcel .
2	now it is all sorted_out .
2	thank_you very much .
2	.
2	i would absolutely without_hesitation recommend you .
2	regards irene swift
2	i ordered 00 , 000 leaflets on the sunday and they arrived on the wednesday .
2	they were fast and efficient and i would recommend them to anyone .
2	definitely a good service .
2	order arrived as per telephone confirmation and in excellent condition .
2	i was kept up to date on order tracking and was able to make arrangements to receive the item without having to wait around all day .
2	excellent customer service - no_hesitation in using again or recommending .
2	many_thanks
2	what more can i say .
2	always deliver on time as promised and never had a problem with anything being out of stock !
2	we have used this service many_times over the past 0 years and have never been disappointed .
2	they are always there to meet you at the airport , at times you may have to wait for other passengers to arrive but it is much_cheaper for resort_hoppa to travel with a full bus loan so this is understandable , and the wait is never too long .
2	without_fail they are always there at the resort at the agreed time to take you back to the airport .
2	the prices are always very reasonable also , and the drivers are very friendly .
2	we are thrilled with this service and will_continue to use it
2	an excellent service as usual .
2	posted phone , freepost , received email to say they '_d received it and then the cheque followed_by return of post .
2	order over the internet over the weekend and collected from the branch following a phone_call late monday_morning .
2	prices much_better_than comet and currys .
2	would definitely recommend and use again .
2	this was so easy to do , it '_s a no - brainer
2	i like ordering bulky items that are heavy to carry from supermarket and i also save money buying from chemist_direct .
2	i use again and again .
2	i ordered wednesday and goods delivered thursday .
2	exactly as ordered and extremely well_packed .
2	very pleased .
2	i pre_- ordered a canon ixus 000hs so had to wait_until it arrived at best cameras .
2	they kept me informed with delivery dates and rang me as soon as they received their stock .
2	i received my camera the next_morning .
2	the courier service was excellent and i was given a one hour delivery window and the camera arrived at the beginning of the timescale .
2	perfect service .
2	i will use this company agin for sure .
2	i was with xln telecom for a number of years when they rang me with a fixed price contract of around £_00 .
2	i noticed that i was then paying more than before , so when i complained they brought it down to £_00 .
2	i was then offered a new deal by a small local company for the same service for only £_00 so i gave notice to xln as required .
2	i had checked this with them and knew that no fee was due .
2	i gave almost 0_months notice .
2	despite this , i was constantly bombarded with invoices for a termination fee of £_000 , even_though they knew perfectly well that this was not due .
2	i got these invoices by email , sometimes several in one day , and also by post .
2	i contacted them and asked to them to stop sending invoices but they continued .
2	even after_speaking on the phone to one of their employees who confirmed that no fee was due , the invoices continued on and on and on .
2	i informed them that if they did not stop sending these invoices , i would cancel my direct_debit as i feared that they would illegally remove £_000 from my account .
2	once again , no reply .
2	i cancelled the direct_debit and informed them that i had done so and asked them to send the final invoice and i would pay by cheque .
2	no reply .
2	the never - ending invoices continued to arrive .
2	the final invoice was for £ 0 of calls including_vat and an invented charge for “ unpaid direct_debit ”.
2	they also overcharged me for monthly_fees as i was only with them for two_thirds of the final month but they charged for the whole month .
2	i wrote to them on 00 . 00 . 00 explaining all this .
2	once again , no reply .
2	now they have written demanding the £_00 they say i owe them , threatening me with debt_collectors and damaging my credit_rating .
2	it would probably cost more to fight this than to just pay , so i am going to pay .
2	hopefully karma will get them in the end .
2	do not use this company .. you pay for the goods get the voucher then nothing arrives .. well and truly conned
2	i have not used animad direct before .
2	but i ordered eye_drops for my dog with a prescription , and it was a very easy to do .
2	the eye_drops arrived the very next_day , and this was during the christmas holidays , so i am very impressed with the fast service , and will be using them the next time i require more eye_drops .
2	i have been a customer for 0_months now and have ordered frontline and food for my dogs .
2	i am very pleased with the competitive_prices and fast delivery every time .
2	chat with ashley today to sort_out a parcel that was not collected .

2	we wanted to create a framed version of an image our son had designed via photoshop of girona , one of our favourite cities and we weren_'_t sure what the quality of a larger image would look like , having only seen it on a laptop screen , but we had it increased to almost a0 and the resolution was superb .

2	really attentive toward the customer .
2	never had that before for a flower delivery , and it was great .
2	grandma was elated , the flowers were amazing !
2	affordable_prices and free delivery , yippee !
2	!
2	fabtastick new shoes from ... yea ..... fitflop !
2	bright and shiny real eye_catching head turners .
2	however , my only_complaint is that the size 0 in this style " new season shoes ", is more like a 0 . 0 and are too_big for me , but im going to get some insoles and heel grips because i luv them so much :-}
2	i am thrilled with everything i have bought with procook .
2	i have a dissability and therefore need to be carefull with the weight of my cooking apparatus , and i am never dissapointed with procook items , they serve me well .
2	web_site is easy to use .
2	order arrived promptly inspite of adverse_weather and christmas_rush .
2	i would definately order from this company again .
2	i saw the fridge_/_freezer that i wanted in a local electrical store ( large chain ) and they told me that if i wanted that particular_model i had to have the display_model as they were no_longer stocking that particular_model .
2	i agreed and went over it with a fine_tooth comb and there wasn_'_t a mark on it .
2	when it was delivered , however , it was battered , bent and scratched and i refused delivery .
2	that left me with a very unhappy kitchen_fitter and potentially no fridge_/_freezer .
2	i immediately got on to appliances_online , found the exact_same make and model and it was delivered at 0 . 00 the following_morning .
2	brilliant service and i cannot recommend them highly_enough .
2	their delivery driver kept me informed as to the exact hour of delivery and was polite , courteous and helpful .
2	can '_t ask for more .
2	item delivered next_day , securely_packaged .
2	great to do_business with .
2	fast , easy , straightforward ......
2	recommended by a friend to use mpb and thy did not disappoint .
2	ordered a used lens , the quality was exactly as_described and within_00hrs it is on the end of my dslr .
2	superb service throughout !
2	i will definitely be using them in the future .
2	excellent as always , easy to order , good information on the website , fast delivery .
2	excellent service all_round .
2	great website , easy to navigate and full of easy to read information .
2	the price was the best around and the next_day free delivery is superb and i was kept up to date with ordering / delivery process throughout .
2	probably one of the best online shopping_experiences i '_ve had .
2	i have ordered twice in the past and will definitely be re - ordering in the future .
2	you have suggested various_options which will provide a better service .
2	your recommendations are all rubbish since we are at the end of a bt copper wire about 0km from the exchange with no alternative optical or other cable .
2	it is therefore impossible for another service provider to offer a faster service .
2	you are providing misleading and false_information
2	as_described .
2	well happy with their customer service .
2	i will deffo be back .
2	thanks
2	first time i have used quinessence , but they had all the products i wanted , at competitive_prices , with excellent information provided .
2	delivery was quick and the good well_packed .
2	would definitely recommend to others .
2	i love this company , they have super products at great prices , and often have really good deal on the products i like .
2	i adore morrocanoil shampoo and conditioner , it smells wonderful and makes my hair lovely and soft .
2	love this site , it had what i was looking for , at a cheaper price than_anywhere_else .
2	they dispatched it really quickly too .
2	very impressed !
2	i found this company on google , searching for vidalta and trying to find the best price online as its pretty expensive getting them from my vet each time .
2	very helpful staff as i wasn_'_t sure if i had sent the correct documents originally .
2	they offer repeat_prescriptions which is great , and are still the best price around , no - one else comes_close to their price .
2	i noticed on my vets prescription , that even they endorse animed now .
2	no_frills , no postage_costs , no_messing_about and the pills came in less_than a week .
2	highly_recommend this company - i have purchased from them a few_times_now and am always extremely pleased not only with the items , the price and speedy delivery but also the unrivalled customer service i received each time .
2	it '_s a real_pleasure to be able to recommend this company to others .
2	other_companies should take webtogs as a perfect example of how to run a business and give great customer_satisfaction
2	item arrived very quickly , was well_packaged and communication form the company was excellent
2	great tips and free water_saving gadgets .
2	loving it ....
2	i had a puncture so this was perfect .
2	i phoned them up and they arranged for a fitter to come to my home on the same day .
2	the fitter arrived within the two hour time_slot i was given and he finished the job quickly and professionally .
2	i saved_myself £_00 and loads of hassle .
2	brilliant !
2	i arranged a surprise weekend for me and two friends in brighton .
2	they were horrified when i told them we would be staying in a hostel but now they ' re converted .
2	our hostel was every bit as good as a hotel .
2	clean , friendly , great location and value for money !
2	i have not been disappointed yet .
2	hostelbookers every time !
2	great products exactly as in website and really quick delivery
2	this company excels in delivering on time in full .
2	they are not expensive but carry a full range and manage to keep prices amongst the lowest of this type of business
2	the site is always easy to use , the delivery direct from amazon is stunningly fast and customer_services helpful
2	i started to use jl about 0 years_ago previously thinking they must have been expensive .
2	then found they often had better products than high_street and often cheaper_than other leading apparently low price high_street stores especially for electrical items .
2	customer service is exceptional before and after sales
2	great products to choose from .
2	very friendly call from customer_services with a query about the order to make_sure it would look right when engraved .
2	fast turn_around of the order too .
2	i was totally unable to access my hard disc recorder when the dog_chewed the remote and i found it so easy to navigate the site and it took only 00_hrs for my replacement to arrive .
2	just in time to record crufts .
2	you '_d think i would have had enough of dogs .
2	well_done to crystal_travel and particularly chang .
2	he was very friendly but respectful and very efficient , he clarified everything for me and answered queries .
2	in particular he actually did what he said he was going to do and quickly !
2	how often does that happen ?
2	thanks again crystal_travel and chang and i am really looking_forward to my aus trip .
2	i have already printed_off my ticket and all is looking good !

2	jenny
2	they had the colour bow_tie i wanted at a great price and it was delivered within 00_hours !
2	i needed to book a journey to a small town in austria .
2	my query was answered_immediately , all bookings made swiftly online , downloaded etickets printed , and paper tickets for zurich to bregenz received by post within 0_days as promised .
2	excellent .
2	reliable company , good value .
2	we have been fooled in to another 00 months contract with talktalk , they are constantly trying to rip us off and take more money what was agreed , stuck with them now but not after 00 months
2	you find that argos i selling nowdays almost everything and they curtomer service is better as the have the rating_system about the service you recieved , so they are all smiles ;))
2	you do find bargains but some ppl arent so friendly or reliable at all and becouse you dont get to try on the clothes / shoes , its a risk sometimes not worth taking
2	animed provide very quick easy service and items at considerably_less_than local_pet shop , with free delivery .
2	perfect .
2	i needed anti_- hairball treats for my cat but my local shop had run_out .
2	found them on petmeds and they were delivered within 00_hours - and more cheaply than i could get the locally .
2	excellent !
2	i '_ve just bought some flip_flops - huge choice , easy process and then i looked at all the other stuff .
2	i think you should have a look - i '_m always using this site from now on , hoodies , surf gear , everything , amazing .
2	try it .
2	after taking ages to decide what to buy , i am more than pleased with my choice of both product and supplier .
2	the tv table arrived within two working_days .
2	it was very easy to put_together , looks robust and stylish .
2	overall , excellent service and product - thoroughly_recommend
2	from the easy to navigate site , informative support material , especially the video_clip on using the knee_support i eventually ordered , to the fast delivery ( next_day ) this has_been a first_class experience .
2	i thoroughly_recommend this company .
2	there were more features available that i didn_'_t even access .
2	excellent .
2	the headphones arrived within_00hrs of the order being made on the lowest mail tarrif available .
2	communications both before , confirming order and despatch , and afterwards were excellent .
2	i shall_certainly use this firm again and recommend it to others .
2	pimlico_plumbers aren_'_t the cheapest of emergency call out companies but when something suddenly goes_wrong with the electrics , you want someone_who really knows what they are doing , is calm , courteous and communicative but looks on the positive side of things .
2	daniel brown from pimlico_plumbers was all this and more when he arrived at my flat to try to sort_out my confusing electrical problem .
2	he didn_'_t stop problem_solving or working from the moment he arrived to the moment he left and was prepared to go the extra_mile .
2	his positive_attitude was the perfect thing to calm my anxieties and his excellent skills and experience as an electrician were quickly clear as he isolated the problem as quickly as he could and then set about rectifying it .
2	within minutes , i trusted that he knew what he was doing and that he was suggesting the best options for me but never forcing me into a decision i wasn_'_t happy with .
2	i can '_t think of a way this call out could have been better .
2	i was looking_forward to seeing jesus christ superstar at leeds arena and booked with viagogo - should have looked at these review before i booked because they really are rip_off merchants .
2	i don_'_t know how they have the cheek to firstly charge double for the actual ticket price on top of a booking_fee and n enormous delivery charge .
2	i could have flown myself to holland and picked the tickets up for the cost they charged !
2	then horror upon horror when we got there we were on the send last row of the 0rd tier and our view was so restricted because of a stupid design fault at the arena as the ceiling_lights stopped us seeing the whole stage and especially the screen at the back of the stage and it really spoilt the show .
2	there was no mention on the website that this ticket was restricted_view or on the ticket .
2	i certainly will be trying to get my money back or go to trading_standards .
2	don_'_t touch these sharks !
2	the dab_radio / cd p ; layer i ordered arrived promptly as_described .
2	received two emails_telling_me exactly when it was going to be delivered with the option of changing the date .
2	very happy .
2	this has to be in your favourites_list !
2	it saves you pounds on things you actually use and on treats for the whole family !
2	excellent !
2	a +++
2	i completely recommend mazuma_mobile to anybody considering selling their old_mobile phone .
2	the service is so quick and easy .
2	you just get a quote online , print_off the freepost labels and send your phone to them .
2	i was amazed to receive payment into my bank_account just 0_days after sending away my phone .
2	all items received very quickly and all items exactly as_described - we ' re delighted with this company and would recommend them to anyone !
2	my mother has dealt_with krs in both equity_release and power of attorney matters .
2	in both_cases the advisors have been efficient , professional and , most_importantly , courteous and respectful to my mother .
2	thank_you for an excellent service .
2	your regular_updates and reminders are very welcome , your delivery service is wonderful and the product is just what we wanted .
2	may your company go from strength to strength .
2	sandra ”
2	sam is a star .

2	great service , prompt delivery with all items well_protected and in good order .
2	very positive value for money over a variety of items .
2	thank_you .
2	i would like to comment on the quality of the goods if only my basket were to arrive .
2	never in all my years of online shopping have i received such appaling service .
2	i ordered a basket and money was taken from my account on 00th_july_0000 .
2	to date ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) i am still waitng for my goods .
2	no apology , email update or single word from online baskets since the end of july .
2	having signed into this site i am now inundated by emails for another part of the company business home_brewing which adds insult to injury .
2	trying to cancel my order requires a letter sent by registerd post ...
2	what kind of company is this !
2	take warning prospective buyer that there is no chance to contact the company by telephone and any email sent recieves no reply or response should you receive poor service .
2	having never ordered currency online before i was very dubious but was well impressed with the excellant service provided . the rate was the best i could find and the dollars were with me the next_day by 0 : 00p . m now thats service !!!
2	would thoroughly reccomend and will_definatley be using the currency_club many more time to come . thank - you
2	i ordered several items of make up and some perfume .
2	i was not expecting much to be honest , but the products and packaging were a0 .
2	i took_advantage of a free_postage offer and it all arrived quickly and safely_packaged .
2	good website for ordering , easy process with clear_instructions . my order was confirmed immediately by email , tracked and arrived within a couple of working_days .
2	i would never order from a company with no contact address or just a post box number .
2	have read other reviews about mastershoe and ordered on the strength of those reviews .
2	also , the price was fair and delivery was free .
2	lovestretch is for me the one stop_shop for clothes that i can wear on any occasion - from the office to an evening party ; from home to going out ; from work to pilates - the style , fashion and service provided but the lovestretch team is top_class .
2	the site is informative and i love their suggestions on coordinates .
2	the quality is amazing too and my dry cleaning bill has greatly_reduced since using lovestretch
2	good service
2	i was contacted by hannah , who was a very pleasant_young_lady .
2	everything asked was easy and straight_forward and within 00_minutes i had the solicitors contacting me .
2	i do not_hesitate to recommend my family and friends to use mazuma .
2	the whole_transaction took about 0 four days .
2	fast , reliable and no_messing_about .
2	found an awesome site .
2	one where all wines and spirits could be found .
2	went looking for gosling '_s rum and gosling mason jar thought i would never find any .
2	google gosling '_s and low and behold drinkshop site came up
2	i ordered 0 mason jugs right away and was surprised how quick they was delivered .
2	the delivery details are the best ive seen for a long time on the web .
2	you can actually arrange when you want your order delivered plus the cost at same time . problem is now i need the black seal rum and the ginger beer to make a " dark and stormy cloud "
2	a drink that got a kick to it
2	thank_you the drink_shop
2	super_fast delivery to alternate address .
2	well_packed .
2	beautiful furniture for a reasonable_price .
2	happy customer
2	i always buy from this site as they are reliable and professional .
2	their products are of the best quality and very affordable , which is something i look for , being a pensioner and on a small income .
2	quickly dispatched and far cheaper_than any you can buy from well_known shops .... i always buy from this source now
2	great site for good quality batteries at a great price .
2	even choosing cheapest delivery option only took a couple of days !
2	excellent service - as usual !
2	quick delivery and great prices .
2	good to know that if it '_s on the website , it '_s in stock !
2	the wool wash has given our elderly sheepskin rugs a new_lease of life !
2	then a quick brush and they look almost new again .
2	faultless and non hassle booking , and best of all the cheapest price .
2	thank_you
2	service was fantastic , but the products are amazing .
2	always low_prices and no_problems with the booking .
2	i like the low_deposit when booking
2	i '_ve been trying to top up my father - in - law '_s mobile with a voucher .
2	haha , more fool me .
2	trying to text 000 fails , i get a text_telling_me its an invalid number .
2	going online gets me in a loop , and when i finally find the right page it tells_me the phone number isn_'_t valid , and that the system will now be locked , whatever that means .
2	ring customer_services with the last 00p credit , the automated selection ( choose 0 , choose 0 etc ) takes me in another loop , then says no credit remaining , thanks for ringing , goodbye .
2	ok , so i can chat online with someone , that '_s good , really fast response ( although i suspect it '_s automated , strange replies to my questions ).
2	guess_what ?
2	the person can only deal with sales enquiries , not technical , goodbye , thanks for calling .
2	i suggest anyone with t - mobile ( or orange , who have also gone down the pan since the ee merger ) gets the hell out and finds another_provider .
2	total_nightmare .
2	i may bill them for the £_00 voucher plus the 0 hours of my time , all wasted !
2	thank_you ebookers for giving me just what i wanted !
2	i visit death row prisoners once a year in the usa and have to raise the funds so i need a good deal .
2	i have used other_companies a couple of times but i always come_back to ebookers .
2	the only_thing i don_'_t like is the £ 0 to use a credit_card .
2	maybe that would make it a 0 . 0_star .
2	however , ebookers are still my first choice .
2	very good and very prompt delivery
2	will definitely use viovet again .
2	the ball on a rope arrived quickly
2	well_packed & very reasonable_price .
2	i was very pleased .
2	fast , friendly website and great value for money .
2	i love the way they keep you informed of the progress .
2	highly_recommend using them .
2	used your company several_times great service quick delivery and best rates
2	saw the perfect pair of prada frames on the high_street , looked great on , then looked at the price and felt faint !
2	£_000 . 00 ( not including the lenses !).
2	no way could i justify paying that .
2	did an internet_search when i got home - found the same pair at dragonspecs for £_000 . 00 ( plus thinner_lenses ), sounded too good to be true , so i did a review search which bought me here .
2	they had some great reviews , so i thought i would give them a try ( despite_being cautious and using my visa_card to pay for them in case something went wrong !
2	).
2	well , the ordering was easy , the communication from alex great ( if only all customer service staff were as efficient !
2	), and the glasses arrived just over a week from ordering !
2	so am i pleased - you bet i am !
2	fantastic ( and genuine ) prada frames , perfect prescription , fast and pleasant service - i will be back again , and will be recommending to my friends and colleagues .
2	i had an issue with a voucher_code and i was lucky_enough to have a gentleman called david to help me .
2	he was professional throughout and very courteous .
2	the courier service was also very good , the parcel was picked_up as specified and no_doubt delivered too .
2	i would recommend this service to anyone and would definately use parcel0go everytime i need to have a parcel delivered .
2	brilliant all_round .
2	it has_been a pleasure to deal with you ...... thank_you !
2	i received text_message about delivery day and time_scale 0_days before expected delivery day with options to choose another day on my convince .

2	arrived 0_days after i ordered , great product , great service only place i could find the safety wellies in the size i needed online .
2	thanks .
2	i have recently_purchased two fairly large orders from the above company .
2	both orders arrived after only two_days .
2	the items i ordered where exactly has discribed on the site .
2	i would reccommend this company .
2	they have everything you need for your celebration .
2	absolutely_delighted with the service .
2	i ordered kids earphones yesterday_afternoon and they arrived this morning !
2	and the best bit , some thoughtful soul had popped two lollipops into the padded_envelope along with my order .
2	what a lovely touch .
2	cheered us all up on a rainy north_yorkshire morning !

2	my son was looking for an engagement_ring so that he could propose to his now fiancée .
2	for his budget the range available on the high_street was disappointing and so i found the diamonds_factory via_google .
2	the choice and value on the web_site appeared to be outstanding and the reviews were excellent so he decided to purchase from the diamond_factory .
2	the only problem was that he had planned to propose before the normal delivery date !
2	we rang the diamond_factory about the date and they couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
2	the timing was tight but they kept us informed all along and the ring arrived as promised the day before the proposal .
2	the result ; a beautiful engagement_ring , an absolutely_delighted fiancée and a wedding to look_forward to next year !
2	excellent service , everything in stock that we needed for start of hockey training .
2	very prompt delivery , arrived on the day specified and barringtons communication was good , e_mailed us every_step of the way .
2	will certainly use again .
2	many_thanks
2	if i was talking to a friend , i would say i have bought from them before and i was very pleased , and would buy from them again !
2	i bought from gjw_titmuss and i wouldn `_t have any_problems in using them again !
2	if you really want value for the mony you spend ,
2	this is where you should be buying from .
2	it was my computer_literate son who used this company to put_together a new p . c .
2	after my current dell was struck by lightening i hadn_'_t had time to research my needs .
2	my son was able to use his up to date knowledge to assemble exactly_what i needed resulting in a computer with everything i needed without paying for what i '_ll never use .
2	i get the impression this company use the best available components and put it all together .
2	i '_ve only had the system up and working for a week , but all seems very well .
2	i was directly involved via communications and i have not had a company keep me so well informed .
2	i was fully kept up to date of all progress , and , when one component failed one of their rigorous tests , instead of making me wait for a replacement , i had an_immediate upgrade .
2	on delivery , i knew strep by step when to expect delivery , to then stage that i knew by text / email what hour my computer would be delivered ... and the name of the driver !
2	!
2	my son '_s verdict , was if this company '_s computer matches their service , they will most certainly be getting future business from the rest of our family ..... can '_t say more than that ...... the guy '_s got high_standards !!
2	!
2	very quick service , good competitive costs , couldn_'_t fault service , would happily_recommend
2	delivery was later than initialty forecast - said 0_days then gave a range covering 0_days .
2	did actually take 0_days
2	efficient company that keeps you informed and delivers great flowers .
2	we have used interparcel for years and cannot_fault the service or value for money !
2	this company just takes your money and runs , no afterthought was given to us the customer , they managed to get everything wrong and would ' nt even try to fix the problems we had even_though it was their fault , in the end i contacted abta and they " persuaded " this dreadful company to refund us our money in full , would warn all who are considering using them .
2	arrived intact and on time .
2	items clearly described on website , communications good and item delivered quickly .
2	i ordered the watch ( a very cheap one just for work ) on boxing_day and it arrived on the 00th , very well_packaged .
2	this is the second watch i '_ve bought from the watchshop and both_times i '_ve been very impressed with the service they provide .
2	given the price of postage these days they are very reasonable with their charges too .
2	i will certainly be back .
2	after waiting for almost 0_months for delivery of this walker trolley for my disabled_mother from another firm , i contacted rdk and one was delivered within 0_days .
2	it was also cheaper from rdk .
2	i would recommend them highly .
2	i '_ve been a customer of littlewoods since ' brian mills ' joined them and have always been delighted with the service they give .
2	free deliveries and returns and , provided items are in stock , the delivery is very fast indeed .
2	i '_m not keem on shopping so being_able to buy things in the comfort of my home is great .
2	the customer service on the phone is excellent too as is the rewards system .
2	if i have one slight complaint it '_s that the choice of clothes for us slightly more_mature ladies is not very extensive , particularly when it comes to ' dressy ' clothes .
2	having said that , i can usually find something suitable .
2	well_done littlewoods .
2	i had 0 phones sat in a drawer .
2	one went to a breast_cancer charity , one to a children '_s charity and one to mazuma ... result !
2	there were clear details as to how the pricing system worked , we then were given a competitive rate in comparison with local provider and this was followed_by a reasonably quick delivery , which was tracked on line .
2	i ordered a new hob on the sunday and it was delivered on tuesday .
2	the courier service delivered efficiently during the time agreed .
2	the hob was easy to fit , looks great and is far more responsive than it '_s predecessor ( which was about 00 years old ).
2	the price was far cheaper_than any of the other dealers in - store or on - line .
2	i would recommend this company and would use them again if they remain as competitive .
2	i '_m amazed this company stays in business with their delivery service .
2	i received an_email_saying what day my item would be delivered and it never came .
2	when i called to see where it was , i heard a long_drawn_out problem they are having with their orders that are going through argos .
2	first of all , i have my own problems , i don_'_t want to hear yours .
2	just deliver it when you said you will .
2	and then they still couldn_'_t promise it would be delivered the next_morning !
2	you '_d think if they knew they had a computer problem and they knew items were not being delivered , they would contact the customer rather then make me stay home all day waiting for an item that wasn_'_t going to be delivered .
2	i don_'_t want to hear your problems , i want results and proper customer service !!
2	!
2	ordered a king mattress online .
2	they delivered a double .
2	the driver just left it and said nothing he can do , contact sainsbury '_s .
2	called a very loud call_centre and told i '_d be contacted within 00_hours .
2	never contacted .
2	after a lot of calls back and forth , i was told mattress is " made to order " and it would not be available another 0_weeks .
2	delivery company very rude !
2	cancelled order and will not order from sainsbury online again .
2	i '_ve_used people i '_ve found through shiply , several_times_now and have found each one to be excellent !
2	i know that i can buy anything from anywhere in the country and be certain that i will find someone to deliver it to me for a very fair price .
2	this opens up loads of possibilities and i love it !!
2	!
2	i received my new bike much_quicker_than_expected and am absolutely_thrilled with my purchase .
2	the bike is very comfortable , especially the handle grips , easy to ride , and is exactly as advertised .
2	my husband put it together with no trouble at all - and i might_add , no_arguments !
2	i would certainly recommend this bike to anyone_thinking of buying one soon .
2	i only wish the weather would improve so that i can get out on the bike .. only i dont want to get it wet !
2	after_spending ages selecting the right ridge frezzer i phoned up to place my order and in less_than 00hrs i was getting a call from the delivery driver to say he would be with me within the hour .
2	delivered unpacked and in working wow great job from call_centre , to warehouse to distupution .
2	another great purchase from a . o .
2	thank_you .
2	after buying a voucher from groupon for the phone contract i really wanted , i headed over to here to read the reviews .
2	i was very apprehensive but thought as i '_d not really lost anything , i '_d give it a go .
2	i submitted the voucher on 0 oct and checked daily for the order update and was pretty disappointed to see it not change , baring in mind they advertise next_day delivery .
2	however , on 0 oct i received an_email to request i give them a ring as they had some network security questions to ask me .
2	that was painless and i am now the proud_owner of a samsung_galaxy_s0 and have been informed the free case , car charger and protective screens will be with me in the next week or so .
2	the contract is the cheapest i could find anywhere and i '_m so glad i used them and will do in the future .
2	after_reading some of the reviews i was apprehensive to say the least .
2	my ray - bans arrived within a week & i am delighted with the price , fast delivery and the free lens cleaner .
2	would definitely use smartbuyglasses for future_purchases !
2	i wanted a small_quantity - 0 . 0 metres - of an out - of - stock l ' orient fabric .
2	just fabrics customer service was excellent - they ordered the fabric , sold it to me at a very good price ; and sent it by courier .
2	with service like this , of course i will buy from them again .
2	i regularly buy pieces of orrefors intermezzo as presents for two friends who love orrefors glassware .
2	royal design offer a wide_range of pieces , at very good prices ; and despatch parcels very quickly to the uk .
2	i shall be ordering again soon !
2	i had been looking for another sanderson lymington duvet_cover and pillow_cases for ages - and found them on the bedeck site , at a very good price .

2	excellent customer service if ever i have had to call them as well
2	i ordered my aeg dishwasher on a monday and it was delivered on wednesday_morning , arrived right on time as per time_slot agreed the night before .
2	there was a cash_back offer on my aeg but i did not know how to go about claiming it back , so i emailed hispek and got all the info back within the hour .
2	there was a slight_problem with the dishwasher not cleaning properly , but it got fixed by aeg within 0_days of me contacting them and i got a call from hispek a few_days_later checking if everything was satisfactory now .
2	will recommend and use you again , excellent after sales service .
2	i ordered an aeg dishwasher on 0 march_0000 and was told it was not in stock but it should only take 0 to 00 days .
2	i called after 00 days , on a thursday and was told it should definitely be in by the next monday latest wednesday .
2	the next thursday i called again and was told definitely next week .
2	when i pointed_out that i was told last_week that it was definitely going to be in this week he was quite rude and said that it was not their fault that their supplier was out of stock .
2	when i asked if he could contact his supplier to find out when they would have them in stock he said that he could not find out and that they can not track the deliveries either .
2	they cannot find out when any delivery is next due , it just arrives and then they can contact us .
2	he was just plain rude .
2	i rang again the next thursday , same old story , should be in next week .
2	i asked if i could cancel the order and was told that was fine , but i probably would not be able to get it elsewhere any quicker .
2	i waited another 0_days and had found the same dishwasher at hispek , who had it in stock and could deliver it in 0_days , it only cost me £_00 . 00 more .
2	so i called redhill again to give them 0 more chance , but was still told that it should be delivered next week , but no guarantees .
2	i cancelled the order on 0 april_0000 and they took my credit_card number and i was told their accounts_department would deal with it , but it could take up to 0_days to show as an credit on my credit_card .
2	00 days_later i called my credit_card company and they had not yet received a refund .
2	i got them to send me a dispute form as i have wasted enough time calling redhill , who will just lie and lie again to you as i have found out by reading your reviews today .
2	redhill appliances seem to be brilliant , when they have things in stock , but the worst when it is out of stock , they just take your money and then don_'_t care and take ages to refund you .
2	it is now 00 april but still no refund .
2	i wanted to buy from a local supplier but will definitely not recommend them to anybody .
2	no customer service whatsoever , rude , bored sales_staff who don_'_t seem to care one bit about their customers .
2	do not buy from them !!!
2	!
2	pre_- ordered batman game for my daughter '_s boyfriend '_s birthday on the 0rd november .

2	i bought 0 tickets in feb ., from viagogo , to see eric clapton at leeds arena on june 00nd .
2	0000 .
2	the tickets arrived on sheets of a0 paper , with someone '_s name and address crossed out in the top left hand corner .
2	when we presented the tickets at the event , they were rejected and classed_as void , because the scanning machine did not recognise the transaction .
2	we had travelled a fair distance and in order to see the show , had to purchase completely new tickets costing a further £_000 . 00 .
2	i would like a full_refund of £_000 . 00 and an_apology , please .
2	this was a very unpleasant and embarrassing experience and i am most upset that i was ripped_off .
2	by the way , we have managed to read the name and address crossed out on the tickets !
2	transaction_id_:_0000000
2	thank_you for your swift action .
2	i am happy to give you a 0_* rating now !
2	found the website through google and as there was a sale at mattressnextday decided to buy a memory_foam_mattress from them .

2	skybingo is really great , i love it , why not try it for yourself
2	living in the channel_islands often means not much choice and high prices for animal products .
2	then some companies don_'_t remove the vat and charge huge postage even for small or light items .

2	made my first order , got free_postage , delivered in 00hours , but forgot to ask them to remove the vat .

2	very pleased with purchase .
2	i found this site by_chance .
2	i booked 0 tickets to see the jersey_boys and 0 tickets to see the lion_king in london .
2	the package included 0 twin beded rooms in london near the theatres .
2	unfortunately , the hotel i booked could not accommodate us , so tickettree telephoned me immediately and informed me of this and offered an upgrade to the ambassadors in bloomsbury with a full english_breakfast .
2	the hotel was beautiful , clean and all rooms were perfect , and sound proof .
2	the staff were extremely_helpful with us 00 ladies .
2	the breakfast was buffet style , with an_extensive variety of foods and as much as you liked , being constantly brought in from the kitchen , freshly .
2	the hotel was a short taxi_ride from the theatres .
2	we thoroughly_enjoyed ourselves and would strongly_recommend this site for hotel and theatre_tickets .
2	the driver was waiting for us at the airport , took us straight to our hotel , wasting no time .
2	picked us up exactly on time and straight to the airport .
2	this helped_us six ladies to have a marvellous holiday in spain .
2	thank_you
2	not received order yet so just reviewing order process .
2	good website with clear product information .
2	they don_'_t make unbelievable claims , just state it as it is .
2	looking_forward to getting started and seeing the results my products arrive .
2	i have bought lots of furniture from oak_furniture_land and i must_say the furniture is lovely .
2	sales people great and delivery men really good .
2	that '_s when things are going well .
2	so what_happens when you receive a fault item ?
2	in my case i ordered a pair of tokyo bedside_cabinets , waited 0_weeks for delivery with some other items .
2	one cabinet was fine , the other looked like it had been dropped before being packed .
2	followed the procedure to raise a case on thursday of last_week and put a landline contact number as i was working from home .
2	got an_email on monday to say they had tried to call me on friday ( turns_out they decided to use a different number no_longer in use - why ?).
2	i have been working from home all of this week and so if they had tried harder to speak to me we may not have got to this point .
2	i work away mon to wed each week and i am now told that they don_'_t have any delivery slots available for thurs / fridays so can '_t tell me when i will get my replacement .
2	odd that when if i go online and go through the process of ordering a new cabinet , it offers me next friday as a named day delivery option if i pay £_00 .
2	maybe they don_'_t want to give that away to a complaining customer !
2	i now have to wait for the delivery guys to phone me to arrange some date in august .
2	they can '_t tell me when because apparently their system isn_'_t showing august dates yet !
2	it '_s only next week for goodness_sake !
2	it would seem to me that ofl work for the delivery guys rather_than the other way round and i just happen to be an annoyance in the middle .
2	why is the customer service department not authorised to make special delivery arrangements in cases where a complaint has_been made .
2	they need to wake_up and realise that we are the most_important customers to please if they want to prevent the many bad_reviews i have since found on this site .
2	the old cabinet is sitting in the way in my hallway and now looks likely to be there for another few_weeks .
2	i have today spoken to customer_services and they have confirmed there is nothing more they can do .
2	no customer service and i will not buy from them again or recommend .
2	update .
2	i received a phone_call from customer_relations ( cr ) about an_hour after i had posted my review on trust_pilot .
2	after a couple of weeks and a few more issues , i now have two lovely matching bedside_cabinets .
2	during this process i have spoken consistently to two case handlers from cr on a number of occasions .
2	if one was going to be out of the office , the other was fully_informed on the latest update .
2	they have both been very apologetic and i believe sincerely so .
2	this is a company that has_gone from being internet only to now having a very large high_street presence ( regrettably something many stores are moving away from ) and at times they are struggling with the extra demand this has put on them .
2	yes there are some problems with quality control ( from the reviews would seem to be certain ranges ) and the end to end supply_chain but i believe they are working to improve these .
2	since i raised the issue , they have already put some additional measures in place to improve sight of the delivery slots that customer_services can offer ( previously they couldn_'_t see the delivery slots showing as available to customers ordering online ).
2	i am also told that they have brought in specialist resource to look at improving the way they do things from a customers perspective .
2	in summary , if you get an issue , remain calm and polite , work with them and give these_guys a chance ( or two ) and some time , to put things right .
2	the furniture is lovely and worth the wait .
2	despite the problems , the way my case has_been handled has restored my faith in ofl and i will buy from them again .
2	i wanted a last_minute present for my husband for our 00th_wedding_anniversary .
2	we were going to mexico and my husband is a keen scuba diver so i thought i would buy him an underwater camera ( ixus camera pack with strobe ).
2	the ability to view a demo video of the camera was fantastic as i am no expert !
2	the camera was ordered online on sunday and arrived within a couple of days as promised ( you can choose a delivery day ).
2	i was sent messages to tell me what time to expect delivery .
2	a fantastic service and i would not_hesitate to order from simply_scuba again .
2	buy the way , the camera is great too !
2	i love shopping with supplement_warehouse ... i get the best prices and when you buy multiples the shipping_charges are extremely reasonable .
2	been shopping here for about 0 years !
2	really great and prompt service - would highly_recommend to anyone !
2	very friendly , helpful and efficient .
2	product cheaper_than_anywhere_else , arrived next_day and was very well_packaged .
2	would definately recommend .

2	my mother in law was delighted with the flowers she received for mothers_day .
2	they arrived promptly and curteously .
2	they far out weighed her expectations .
2	thank_you
2	brilliant value for money and a big selection .
2	i buy shoes and boots and haven_'_t found any_problems , even_though they are only a fiver a pair .
2	a very happy customer .
2	i ordered more than £_000 of bathroom furniture from this company on wednesday 0th_november_0000 expecting it to be dispatched the following_day .
2	by the friday , the status of my order was still showing as " processing " so i thought i would try their live_chat service to find out what was happening .
2	i was told my order was out for delivery .
2	a short while later i went back onto live_chat to find out if they meant my order would be delivered that day or if they meant it would be delivered on a different day .
2	at this point
2	i was told that " live_chat " had no access to existing orders and i would have to phone an 0000 number to check my order status .
2	i explained that i had already been told by " live_chat " that my order had been dispatched already .
2	the operator then said ok - i will check for you .
2	he came back to me and said it would be delivered that day so i made sure the was someone in at all times to take delivery and guess_what .
2	- it did not arrive .
2	i also made sure someone was home all next_day but still no delivery .
2	this morning monday 00th_november i tried " live_chat " again only to be told that theyg have no access to existing orders !
2	i phoned the 0000 number - it was more than 00_minutes before i got an answer .
2	the lady i spoke to said that my order had been cancelled !
2	i explained that i had not cancelled the order and she said she would check up and get back to me .
2	after 00_minutes and no phone_call from them i got back on to the 0000 number and got through to a gentleman by the name of suheb - it took more than 00_minutes before my call was answered and then i was kept on hold for several more minutes before he came back to me and said he would have to do some more checking .
2	at this point i had had enough of forking_out for expensive phone_calls but still not getting an answer to my problem and cancelled the order .
2	i asked how long it would take before i got my refund and he said between 0_0 working_days .
2	strange phenomenon because the money left my bank_account the day i placed the order .
2	anyone taking bets that i get my refund without_any_problems .......?
2	i needed to send a parcel from bristol to glasgow and checked out royal_mail who wanted more than £_00 to do the job - my parcel weighed 0 . 0 kilos .
2	parcel0go did the job for less_than £ 0 !
2	my parcel was sent on friday and was delivered in glasgow in perfect_condition at 0am on monday .
2	cannot_fault this service and would not_hesitate to use it again .
2	ordered 0 pairs of glasses on a tuesday and they were delivered to my home on the following saturday !
2	this is excellent customer service in my book .
2	in addition , i used a groupon_voucher so the cost of the 0 pairs of glasses was £_00 . 00 including postage !!
2	this is my first time buying from this company but it will not be my last .
2	booked a car at glasgow_airport - when i arrived there was no vehicle available .
2	after waiting at the hertz desk for 0 . 0 hours and speaking to a representative on the phone they agreed to cancel my booking with hertz and transfer me to enterprise but at a much higher cost which i refused .
2	eventually , they agreed that i would get my vehicle at the original price and hertz would make up the shortfall .
2	i then had to transfer to the enterprise desk and wait there while my booking was being_processed .
2	some 00_minutes later the enterprise representative asked me for more money than i had agreed to on the telephone so i refused .
2	i had no more time to take the matter up with rentalcars . com as i was on my way to attend a funeral and had to leave the airport and take a taxi .
2	they took the cost out of my bank_account and when i complained they refused to refund the full_amount and charged me £_00 . 00 as a cancellation_fee despite the fact that i had been kept waiting for almost 0 hours and i did not cancel my booking - enterprise wanted more money than i had agreed to pay .
2	avoid these crooks at all costs .
2	really pleased with all my purchases , really fast service at bargain prices , no damage , will certainly be shopping wit you agin :-))
2	i have recommended these to many of my friends .
2	best selection best value and fast delivery .

2	i would certainly use this company / website for my future_purchases .
2	:-)
2	a very happy customer
2	i was looking for a watch for my teenage grandson for his_birthday , i found the watchshop from a web search .

2	i then looked for an_alternative , there were loads to choose from so he chose his own .
2	the ordering process was very quick and easy and secure .
2	i was sent emails at each_stage of the delivery process , order recieved , item picked and item dispatch which was very helpful , the watch was delivered today it was ordered on the sunday_afternoon and delivered on the wednesday_morning , and i am delighted with it , as i hope my grandson will be .

2	do not use this company
2	my boiler stopped_working on the 00th_november , no heating or hot_water . i rang them and they said the earliest they can send an engineer out is three_days_later on 00st .
2	my boiler has a reset button which i pressed and i also tried turning boiler off and on but did not work .
2	any way the engineer came in the 00st , pressed the reset button and it started up .
2	he said he did not know what the problem was so could not order a part .
2	he gave_me a diary to complete should it fail again with questions to answer to give a better idea as what was wrong .
2	the boiler lasted 0 hours before stopping again .
2	i rang them straightaway and this time the earliest they could send an engineer was 0_days_later on 00 november .
2	to make_matters worse i had a burst water pipe from the bathroom which flooded my dining_room .
2	this is not drying out properly due to no heating .
2	i was in despair , felt unwell and depressed .
2	the engineer came on the 00th and said the boiler needed a part which they did not have in stock so needed ordering .
2	he said the customer service team would contact me that afternoon with an_appointment date .
2	they did not ring me i had to ring them .
2	they said the part on order would be in stock on monday 0nd_december and when it comes in they will then contact me with an_appointment date .
2	i asked them if they could make a provisional date now rady for when the part comes in and they said their system does not allow them to rechedule in that way .
2	i told that it made sense to make a provisional appointment which they could them give to somebody_else if the part is not in on time and again they said that cannot do that .
2	i asked for and idea of how long i would possibly wait for an_appointment once the part is in and he said " about 0 or 0_days " ( in other words how long is a piece of string .
2	by the time my boiler is fixed and up and running i will have been without heating and hot_water for 0_weeks .
2	this company i '_d quick enough at taking your money but runs it on a shoe string where engineers are concerned .
2	i am waiting til my boiler is up and running and then i am taking my business elsewhere .
2	do not use eon for boiler repairs
2	i called bella_barista as i wanted next_day delivery of an ecm machine .
2	i spoke to marko who couldn_'_t have been more helpful .
2	he explained the differences_between the different_models and then pulled_out all the stops to get us next_day delivery .
2	the machines are bench tested before they go out and this was a friday_afternoon , but they did it .
2	the machine was , as they state , double boxed and packaged to ensure no damage in transit .
2	what '_s more , they use a fantastic delivery company - east_midlands delivery company , whose service lives up to the high_standards of bella_barista .
2	if you need to enquire_about your delivery , you actually get straight through to someone helpful - not an_automated_system like most companies .
2	as i unpacked our beautiful machine ( it is a work of art !)
2	i also some found a few goodies that marko had packed as a gift .
2	marko even emailed to make_sure we had got the machine ok and to ask if we needed any help .
2	its true , their customer service goes on long after the initial purchase .
2	simply the best
2	excellent customer service , great execution and quality and very fast delivery .
2	i am very happy with my flyers .
2	they look really great .
2	i like to create my own marketing_material and stationery .
2	so all i needed to do was to create the flyer and send the file over and the job was done .
2	it was an amazing experience .
2	for me it is very important that i can update and change my marketing_material without_any fuss and this company is providing me with the service i was looking for .
2	if you are looking for a company who is providing an excellent service and quality , this is the company to go to .
2	i will definitely come_back for more ...
2	i am a repeat customer and i totally can recommend this company .
2	i was looking for good quality products in the internet and also on the high_street but i was not really satisfied .
2	then i came_across the dapw and i am very happy that i found this company .
2	i have bought mulberry_silk duvets , mulberry_silk pillows and other silk_bedding products .
2	the quality is outstanding and exceeded my expectations .
2	i am a very happy customer ... and i want to say thank_you for my good night sleep .
2	:-))
2	i am so happy that i found this company as i was looking for exclusive and high_quality hair_accessories for a while .
2	i am a repeat customer and i can say that the service is absolutely consistent and fabulous .
2	the delivery is very fast and i also have to mention that the products are wrapped and boxed with a lot of passion and love .
2	it is really an amazing company with great products and with a customer service which will exceed your expectations .
2	i could not complain one bit about the ryan_air flight i took to alicante and back to the uk i booked through a company by the name of onthebeach . com which i highly_recommend
2	excellant company i picked_up what seemed a brand_new peugeout 000 from goldcar at alicante_airport and could not wished for it to h ave been more efficiant the service was excellant and also on drop_off as well .
2	i will certainly be using this company again if i return .
2	as i write i am_currently being billed by both europa , and telfonica for the same line rental .
2	when i call europa they say they will investigate and call me back - do they ?
2	that will be a no then .
2	so far my 0 emails to 0 different_departments have gone unanswered .
2	when i moved recently , i cancelled my line with them and took up a new one .
2	you won_'_t be surprised to learn i am now being billed for 0 lines , but wait , i notified them and they apologised for the error , promised me a refund against my new account , and promptly billed me again .
2	i had the payment stopped at my bank , so they have now issued me with a debt warning .
2	what a bunch of wasters .
2	i am now approaching a new supplier - enough is enough .
2	living_abroad for fifteen years , i really don_'_t know how we managed before hifx , when we used our bank everything took so long , in one case a large_sum took 00 days to clear , having sat in a clearing house in bilbao for 0 month ???
2	while we and our english bank tried to trace it . then they had the cheek to charge us when we know they had been using our money while we waited for it .
2	now with hifx i feel in control .
2	it is all done on line in a very few_minutes .
2	you can see exactly_what you are getting and it is all acknowledged by email and text instantly , then you get further texts_advising each_stage of the payment .
2	absolutely trustworthy i could not recommend highly_enough .
2	order placed just before the deadline for next_day delivery taken readily by very helpful young_lady and order duly delivered the next_day .
2	never ever use expedia .
2	they cannot handle the simplest hotel booking , and when attempted to correct the errors , you might as well be dealing_with martians .
2	also , they attempt to make out that it '_s the fault of the consumer , particularly galling with me , as a highly qualified oxford graduate .
2	you have been warned !
2	o stars
2	lenses for hire made everything so easy - great site , clear_instructions for ordering and returning and a quality lens .
2	i '_m already_planning which one to hire next .
2	buongusto excellent !
2	easy wellies delivered my rok wellies on time - exactly as ordered .
2	initially i was very pleased with the wellies except that they had very little tread and i needed to be careful when i was out somewhere slippery .
2	they arrived in june and i didn_'_t wear them for some time - possibly not till september .
2	i don_'_t wear them all day - only for and hour to an_hour and a half each day and only on the canal towpath and old railway line - not very exacting walking .
2	the boots have now split - one in 0 places along a molded seam and the other along one of these seams - i assume it will also go in 0 places soon !
2	i haven_'_t contacted easy wellies as yet - just wanted everyone to know about the wellies before they buy any .
2	received money very quickly - no_quibble !
2	got a response with pp label for return straight after contact .
2	dropped phone off at local ups collection_point at our convenience store and message_confirming_receipt .
2	phone back in a couple of days good as new !
2	worth_every_penny when you are as clumsy as i am !
2	emma was just the kindest and friendliest person i could speak with and she dealt_with my problem very quickly and in an excellent manner .
2	thank_you so much for this and i wish everyone used this service , it is fantastic .
2	the product is what i want and the price is grear , so why would i need to go_anywhere_else .
2	walked_into the local carphone_warehouse to take back a faulty phone charger !
2	obviously having disturbed the staff from their slumber i was never going to be treated_courteously but was basically told it was my fault the appliance was broken and i '_d voided the warranty !!
2	have never been spoken to so rudely by a retail worker and will never cross that threshold again !
2	have used these numerous time now and never had any reason to not fully_satisfied with their service .
2	delivery is super quick and the website is very easy to use .
2	was so very very easy to complete and only took about 0 minutes and we had an_email immediately about confirmation of our cover .
2	i would recommend double 0 as they advised you by text when tickets have been dispatched so you know when to expect them and you are not left_wondering_if they have got lost in the post .
2	we always use mazuma to sell our unwanted_mobile_phones they always give an excellent valuation and never back track on that price like others .
2	the transaction is very quick and very easy , anyone can do it .
2	the last mobile phone we sent went by recorded delivery one day and the cheque arrived within 00_hours , how amazing is that .
2	what would we do without you mazuma !
2	excellent value , quick delivery , great item , no_problems at all .
2	amazing service !
2	i realised my fridge_freezer had stopped_working monday_afternoon and it full .
2	in a panic i ordered another that evening .
2	i kept the door closed and the contents were still frozen when the new one arrived on tuesday !
2	almost the same model so i could put the drawers straight_into the new one .
2	i was looking for a festive christmas light set to go on my window cill and was delighted to find this light arch .
2	it will go perfectly with my christmas decor and i '_m extremely pleased to have found them .
2	they arrived promptly - i won_'_t be using them until december but i '_m_sure they will look lovely .
2	having recently had to purchase flea_treatments for my four_cats from my vet , which cost £_00 . 00 , i then decided to exactly the same from medicanimal - £ 0 . 00 with free_postage !
2	i definitely won_'_t be buying from my vet again but will always source from medicanimal - superstars !
2	these_guys just do exactly_what they say they will do !
2	if they can '_t , they tell you .

2	this was our first villa_plus holiday and i am already looking to book again for next year .
2	the villa_plus website is easy to navigate and booking was very straight_forward .
2	the villa was gorgeous - spacious , clean and in a great position .
2	the morning after we arrived , debbie , our rep , paid us a short visit .
2	we had occasion to call her twice ( once the wifi in the villa cut out and secondly to ask her advice on the best way for our son to get to ayia napa ) and both_times she was really helpful , returning our call within a few_minutes .
2	directions to the villa were accurate and we found it no problem , even in the dark .
2	all our dealings with villa_plus staff were very positive and i have no_hesitation in recommending them .
2	the best exchange_rate i could find ( made my bank '_s rate look laughable ), easy to use website , fast and efficient service .
2	have used the company on three occasions and they were very speedy and when i changed a recent order were very efficient .
2	would recommend them to any knitters out there .
2	the laptop was equal to brand_new , packaged superbly and delivery was exactly when stated .
2	i would not_hesitate in recommending this company .
2	first_class all_round
2	just thought i '_d share the brilliant customer service from_start to finish from ao . com ordering was easy and totally stress_free with next_day delivery for a small_fee .
2	i would buy from this company without_hesitation every time .....
2	brilliant !!
2	!
2	i bought an item which they showed as available .
2	i had a confirmation_email to say it would be delivered in 0 - 0_days .
2	thriteen days_later i rang and emailed them , was told the item was not available !
2	they couldn_'_t refund it unless i sent an_email to cancel .
2	no notification - really let_me down big style !
2	would never use again and will not be recommending to anyone .
2	cheaper_than qvc , quick delivery !
2	fantastic service !
2	sent for a sample and will be ordering on the strength of the quality and prompt service .
2	although we haven_'_t opened our boxes yet we know that if there should happen to be anything wrong wren will sort it out for us .
2	for richard our kitchen designer nothing was too much_trouble .
2	despite a ' blank canvas ', a very dusty house in the process of renovation , he managed to come up with a design which we ' re eagerly waiting to have built within the next two_weeks .
2	watch this space ...!
2	i saved money and didn_'_t need to travel 0 milles to the verts to fetch it .
2	great , will use again .
2	really pleased with the quality and fit and just the right length .
2	the only problem was that the cardi came fully buttoned and it took me ages to undo them all with my 00 year_old fingers !
2	pretty buttons though !
2	would buy again in a different colour , thanks woolovers , you ' re great to deal with .
2	i recently bought an oak chopping_board for my son and daughter - in - law and arranged to pick it up personally on my way down to see my granddaughters in devon .
2	owing to traffic i was much later than i intended but not only did andy wait for me to arrive ,, despite having a very young baby at home to get back to , he gave_me guidance every_step of the way to his workshop from the m0 and greeted me warmly .
2	nothing '_s too much_trouble , he '_s super knowledgeable about the wood he uses , and quite_frankly he '_s prepared to go more than the extra_mile to give great service .
2	thanks andy .
2	the chopping_board '_s brilliant by the way !
2	ease of on - line ordering and price highly competative .
2	contact from mattressonline re discontinued mattress_protector ordered was solved with an upgrade at no extra_charge .
2	however i informed about the restricted access to the cottage with limit at a luton van size vehicle .
2	no one read the notes and on the morning of delivery as we were waiting , a phone_call informed us that the van arranged was too_big to come .
2	further communications from delivery company poor , leaving us to chase_up via mattressonline .
2	early morning call with phone number to contact , connected to a message which said office now closed .
2	delivery finally came next_day , but plastic mattress cover very dirty and torn and new mattress had dirty patches .
2	i have phone and broadband with talk_talk .
2	since tiscali was taken over by talk_talk , more_expensive poor products , bad service , non - existant customer service , impossible to contact anyone , slow slow slow connection via broadband , keep selling me extra products that never materialise .
2	stores understaffed .
2	empty shelves .
2	short_dated produce .
2	response to customer feedback is very poor .
2	staff on the tills are doing their best under poor management .
2	products that i wanted at a fair price .
2	fast delivery .
2	items well_wrapped so no_breakages .
2	good communication .
2	i would highly_recommend armorica .
2	you know i '_m very happy with jgd ...
2	i make all my parchment order with them .
2	i want to tell you they are very good on crafts products .
2	hope you enjoy it !!!!
2	and don_'_t leave this opportunity ... you '_ll see that i was right .
2	delivered on time and the delivery men were very polite and helpful .
2	excellent quality freezer just the right size .
2	great removal company found at very competitive price
2	two healthy_trees arrived well_packaged and on the day promised .
2	the email the day before delivery was much_appreciated .
2	i have a 00 year_old tumble_dryer - i couldn_'_t find the part i needed .
2	i posted a message on their website - i had an answer within an_hour and the part within 00 .
2	that '_s what i call service .
2	came faster_than_expected
2	packed so was super protected
2	ease of ordering
2	ease of paying
2	absolutely fantastic
2	have told all my friends
2	i would reccommend petfleas for their reasonably_priced goods delivered promptly .
2	i ordered from this company mainly_because of the quick delivery time ( 0 / 0_days ).
2	i received the item nearly 0_weeks after order placed .
2	on my first phone_call ( 0_days after ordering ) i was told the item would be sent out that day .
2	i was unhappy about this but accepted their assurances .
2	my next call was 0_days after ordering and was again told it would be sent out that day .
2	the person was not interested that i had been assured on 0 previous occaissions that the item was being despatched because i couldn_'_t provide the name of the persons i had talked to .
2	the item finally arrived 00 days after ordering .
2	i had given up on ever receiving the item so ordered from another company and it arrived after 0_days and on the same day as the item from one click pharmacy .
2	i will not be using this company again .
2	their customer service to me was non - existent .
2	the service was very good .
2	the delivery was next_day as promised .
2	i would recomend you to anyone .
2	many_thanks .
2	excellent quick and easy service , gets rid of old_phones hanging about in the cupboards and drawers .
2	fully recommended service .
2	i found it very easy to use .
2	the delivery instructions / labels and collection points made postage simple and free .
2	took a little while to receive the cheque , but was kept_informed of every_stage of the process and i got the whole amount they had quoted .
2	i ordered flowers for my mother - in - laws_birthday and she loved them .
2	great price '_s and good service are hard to find but eflorist gave both will definitely use them again . xx
2	i had a great experience right from the start , a clear and easy to use web_site , i felt well looked after at every_step and my order arrived on the day they said it would .
2	it does what it say '_s on the tin .
2	for a change this company did everything it said it would and delivery was very prompt .
2	the price very competitive .
2	well_done pixmania . co . uk
2	ordered my currency thursday_night and it was delivered first thing sat_morning .
2	good exchange_rate and first_class service .
2	i always use simply_supplements for best quality , reasonable value and above all else , excellent fast delivery !
2	i have been with this company since they took over tiscali .
2	i have never had to use their customer service until two_weeks_ago when i lost my asdl line .
2	i am still without the internet and suffered hours of frustrating customer service phone_calls at a premium_rate number .
2	i was sent all over the world to call_centres that i couldn_'_t understand and only seemed to be able to work from a set of rules in a robotic manner .
2	technical help didn_'_t call back when they said they would and their was no understanding or sympathy .
2	i now am leaving i have had to pay bt to give me a new line with broadband and i am out of contract with talktalk but dread phoning them up to cancel my service with them .
2	talktalk have said that if i cancel my direct_debit they will charge me even_though i have no service .
2	i have got a mac code from them eventually but bt will not use it because they are supplying a new line .
2	please_please_please people show this company who has the power and do not go_anywhere_near them and tell your freinds to read all the reviews on trust_pilot .
2	only then may talktalk realise that they have to stop this appalling customer service .
2	good competitive_pricing , free delivery , fast delivery on specified dates .
2	i will definitely buy from this company again and will strongly_recommend !!
2	!
2	was so pleased with bed and how easy it was to put_together the updates of the delivery time was really helpful would buy from store again .
2	recieved my 0 pairs of glasses in 0 0 / 0_days and they are perfect great price and service .
2	i am a regular_purchaser of higher_nature products and i am never disappointed by the quality of the items nor of the standard of service they provide .
2	service level never_fails and is matched by the quality of the products
2	i am usually very organised and in_advance when it comes to my cars mot .
2	not this time have had a lot going on in my life this last few_weeks and suddenly_remembered mot due next_day .
2	went into panic mode phoning round every local_garage / mot centre to get my car booked in in to be greeted with sorry luv cant fit you in should of tried earlier !!!!!
2	or we can send you a reminder next time its due so that you dont_forget . im usually very sceptical_about things advertised on the internet and if it sounds too good to be true it very often is £_00 for an mot with free delivery and collection nah dont believe it but with no other options i booked it in on line and less_than 00_mins later a very helpful gent called me to confirm my appointment for the next_day collection between 0 - 00am and a confirmation_email with all the details .
2	i was still worried kept thinking what if its a scam what if they take my car and dont return it .
2	no need to worry at all got a call from the collection driver at 0 . 00am to say he was on his way and would be there within 00_mins true to his word he arrived 0 . 00am took my car left his outside my house and said he would call me later to let_me know if it had passed recieved a call at 00 . 00pm to say it had passed but required two bulbs at a cost of £ 0 . 00 total_cost of mot and bulbs £_00 . 00 which i paid over the phone .
2	arrived home from work that evening to find my car back outside my house keys and mot cert through the door what more can i say except i will_definately be using them again absolutly_brilliant .
2	thanks guys .
2	i originally ordered a tumble_dryer from currys .
2	they failed to deliver at the time arranged and i cancelled my order .
2	when i ordered the exact_same item from ao . com i was pleased to find that not only was the item cheaper , but they could deliver next_day for a lower price than i paid currys .
2	i was kept_informed by email as well as the driver as to when it would be delivered .

2	great customer service both on the phone and with the purchasing dept .
2	well_done outdoorkit
2	i found the watch i had already chosen , ( at an unbeatable price too i may add ) for my " husband to be "
2	i rang the shop , placed the order via the website and paid .
2	00_hours_later i have the watch and it is gorgeous .
2	you cannot get any better service than that - in - fact i have endured more problems buying a loaf of bread !
2	!
2	thank - you iconic_watches ltd
2	well , i couldn_'_t_resist them could i ?
2	after all the running around the internet i '_d been doing looking for some fitflops that i could use as a pair of slippers , i '_d almost given up .
2	well you know what it '_s like , you get them for the summer and they show such good results then wham , along comes winter and you lose all that toning up you '_ve worked so hard for .
2	well luckily i found shoetique , and luckily they had just what i was looking for .
2	and third tiime lucky , there was a reduction in price on the very item i was looking for .
2	now you might think that that was enough being lucky but no , i qualified for free_p_&_p too !
2	what more could a girl ask ?
2	when i placed my order with chemist_direct i was only going to have a look at supplements to help with skin elasticity and possible collagen replacement but then i found something that encompassed everything i needed and at a reduced price , regener0 .
2	i am hoping that this product will help my skin problems that i am experiencing after a long illness .
2	just don_'_t do it !
2	to be perfectly honest i have ordered from simply in the past and had no_problems but this company is now nothing but pathetic excuses and no action .
2	i have the same history of order issues as other_reviewers on here i . e the status changing from ' priority dispatch ', ' waiting for courier ' and then on to ' backlog order '.
2	in the end despite simply repeatedly thanking_me for my patience which by now was in very short supply , i cancelled the order and bought my lens elsewhere .
2	now all that i can forgive as i should have researched them properly in the first place but the part where i am now waiting for them to take action on , ' a refund request has_been submitted .
2	it will be processed asap ', is beyond a joke .
2	i have been waiting for an entire week for them to refund my money , which they had no_problems debiting from my credit_card account straight_away .
2	i have pointed_out to them that in the time it takes them to reply to my emails , a refund could simply have been processed .
2	why on earth does it take them weeks to process a refund ??
2	i have been informed ' normally the refund can take up to 0_weeks on occasion for the refund to be initiated due to current processes we have in place .
2	with regards to your refund it has_been flagged for priority already so it will be processed as a soonest available opportunity .'
2	......... why ?
2	why on earth can '_t the refund take place straight_away ?
2	you can ask simply these questions and all you will get is the same blanket statements without_any real or truthful explanations .
2	i just want my money returned to my credit_card account but it would appear that i am actually going to have to lodge a complaint with my credit_card company to get anywhere .
2	if you take your chances trying to buy from this company , you can '_t say nobody warned you !
2	update !
2	finally received my refund following daily emails to simply , perseverance paid off ....
2	ordered a lens for my son and it arrived earlier_than they said it would .
2	the emails they send out are helpful and the tracking_information is spot_on .
2	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend digital_rev but i haven_'_t used their customer service or returns service so can '_t comment on that .
2	fab customer service and very fast delivery .
2	highly_recommended
2	had a great experience with mazuma booked online to sell them a phone bag arrived we posted it off and within 0_days we had received our argos_voucher :-) happy days .

2	the company is always friendly , helpful and orders are promptly delivered .
2	0_star product and service .
2	ordered on monday , delivered on wednesday at a cheaper price than_expected !
2	having_researched the cat_flea product ( stronghold ) this was the cheapest site by far - we have 0 cats so the price really does make a difference to us !
2	it was easy to order ( just ask your vet for a prescription and don_'_t be talked into buying the stronghold from them for twice the price !)
2	and was delivered 0_days_later .
2	we are now flea - free once again !
2	frontline_spot - on ceased to have any effect whatsoever but have now found an excellent replacement which was solely developed for animal use and not for agricultural use on crops like most of the other flea products .
2	can highly_recommend viovet and stronghold !

2	a request - can you do balloons as well ?
2	ancestry give access to records which would be difficult to access if using record offices or needing to buy copies of census returns .
2	parish information is invaluable .

2	researchers need to be objective when considering suggestions as some simply do not fit , but are blindly accepted , creating confusion when other family trees are offered .
2	convenience for saving information is excellent .

2	your vegan choices are great .
2	i can '_t praise your products enough . thank_you .
2	i bought this pillow in hope of being comfortable in bed and to be able to get a good nights_sleep . i have spinal problems and i '_m in a lot of pain . this pillow is lovely , warm and soft but firm at the same time . i now sleep much_better .
2	the pillow arrived as stated . i highly_recommend this pillow for comfort .
2	fragrance_direct is brilliant .
2	i '_ve done all my christmas shopping already and put all the wonderful smellies away .
2	fragrance_direct gives me the opportunity to spoil myself and others at a budget price that i can_afford .
2	i '_m so pleased that i found them .

2	order not delivered !
2	no reply to e_-_mails and it would appear that the contact telephone_number has_been disconnected !
2	i am now in the process of contacting the trading_standards authority .
2	have tried all day to contact iflorist , to no_avail !
2	i have also been ' blocked ' by them on facebook , presumably because i had the audacity to post that i hadn_'_t received my order and was considering contacting_trading_standards .
2	i see you have replied to some of the reviews on here iflorist and wondered_if you would be courteous enough to do the same for me as i have exhausted every other method of trying to make contact with you !
2	many_thanks !
2	i fully recommend anyone_wishing to embark on a career in fitness or indeed add to their current fitness qualifications to contact hfe .
2	i am_currently studying for my etm level 0 and right from the very start i have been impressed by the level of professionalism demonstrated by not only my tutor gary mcdonald , but also yvette sanderson with whom i have just completed my practical training .
2	give them a call ... you won_'_t be disappointed !
2	good quality and service would defo use again
2	good value , good service
2	have ordered several_times from this company with no_problems .
2	returns are dealt_with promply and fairly .
2	some sizes are a little off but returning is easy
2	fast reliable service
2	this site was so easy to use , i can '_t recommend it enough !
2	just put in your parcel details ( weight and size ) and you '_ll be able to see instantly all the available couriers , services and prices - you don_'_t even need to put in the collection / delivery postcodes initially , so they make it possible to get a quote and maintain your privacy !
2	just out of interest , i went to a couple of the couriers direct sites - and discovered that in order to get a quote it would '_ve been necessary to phone them up , and on one of them where i could get an online quote , the cheapest price quoted was £_00 more_expensive than the price they quoted throughh parcel0go - for some bizarre reason they '_d conveniently " forgotten " to make it possible to buy the economy service ; either that , or it was so well hidden i couldn_'_t find it ...!
2	so much_nicer to be able to put in the details online and then decide which courier service i wanted to use - all options and prices available , from the cheapest economy to the most expensive , with at_least six different courier companies within the uk !
2	i was also lucky_enough to notice that on facebook they were offering a bonus 0 %_discount today , making it even better value .
2	add to this a wide_range of methods of payment , including paypal , i couldn_'_t really hope for more .
2	i '_ve previously looked at different couriers when i wanted to send something large , and ended_up completely confused .
2	none of that when i used parcel0go for the first time today , it really is so straightforward - all i have to do now is wait for my chosen courier to turn_up on monday !
2	0_weeks before our holiday they emailed to say accomodation was no_longer available .
2	trying to get back the deposit has_been a nightmare .
2	i would strongly_recommend that you look elsewhere to book your holiday .
2	£_00 a month for years then no heating or hot_water yesterday so i rang them to arrange a call - out .
2	despite having an 0 month_old baby in the house i was told to wait for over a week before an engineer could fix the problem .
2	nothing else to add ...... this speaks for itself
2	after buying something on ebay the seller quoted me the cheapest royal_mail price -£_00 . 00 for a 0kg parcel .
2	the parcel would be 0nd_class and take approx 0_days to reach me .
2	the seller was delighted when i said i would arrange for the parcel to be collected from her workplace - all she had to do was print out the label .
2	she has since informed me that her work_colleagues were so impressed by the service and the savings that they are now going to use parcels0go .
2	many_thanks - i cannot_praise the service enough and the ease of your website is fantastic .
2	peter_chandler and team - keep_up the good work
2	what a fantastic find - internet_shopping doesn_'_t get better_than this -

2	the best service ever and the most beautiful flowers .
2	i ordered in the morning and the flowers arrived early the same day as promised .
2	my mother in law loved them as usual .
2	never disappointed ......
2	i am_disgusted to see the number of people selling really good seats for chrissie hynde at the rfh at extortionate prices when the true fans had to spend_ages hanging on yesterday only to get dud seats in the rear stalls .
2	it '_s a disgrace that you are enabling ticket_touts in this way
2	my mum is 00 years young and finding gifs to send over to the u . k from w . a becomes increasingly_difficult so i regularly use serenata_flowers to let her know i am thinking of her particularly on special days such as christmas and birthdays .
2	i think secretly she expects them now but is always over the moon when they arrive at her door .
2	i have always found the service really prompt and helpful and although i dont actually get to see the flowers at 00 my mum is quite a critic and has only ever said great things about her flowers and delivery . thank_you serenata i will_continue to give you my custom and recomend you to friends .
2	browsing and shopping in this delightful shop , tucked_away near hungerford is a treat .

2	a set of watercolour brushes was ordered from saa for my birthday by my husband .
2	we have had to wait one month for half the brushes to arrive ( long past said birthday !)
2	when i rang to complain today , saa said that they get frustrated with their suppliers .
2	i am the one still_waiting for the remainder of the brushes and they have had full payment for all that time .
2	only_thing that saa suggested was that i return the brushes and await a full_refund .
2	not very satisfactory .
2	poor service saa !
2	very pleased , reasonable_prices and quick service which is a must in my business , all in all a very good site
2	i purchased a pair of ski_gloves from webtogs and after a few_days use on holiday they developed a fault .
2	on return i contacted webtogs who asked me to return the gloves so they could send them back to the manufacturer for review .
2	the manufacturer accepted that this was a stitching fault and replaced the gloves .
2	i had a pair of new gloves within about ten days of sending the faulty ones back .
2	webtogs kept me fully_informed during this brief period .
2	i can highly_recommend the company for brilliant and proactive customer service .
2	and great prices too !
2	excellent t shirt and delivery
2	fabulous service .
2	considering the weather and the fact it is christmas i ordered mugs on tuesday_evening and they was delivered first thing thursday_morning .... brilliant !
2	the quality was amazing even_though one of the photos i sent was slightly blurred , it looked really professional , i '_m 000_per_cent pleased and would recommend them to anyone and definitely use this site again :-)
2	ordered dawn redwood from mail order trees as the one in ordered from trees - online arrived damaged .
2	it was packed into a box that was too small and the leader had broken off .
2	i was not confident that the tree was going to be replaced , this has now been resolved_satisfactorily .
2	i now have the pleasure of owning three dawn redwoods , the damaged one i will give to one of my sons .

2	ordered a chiminea for a birthday_present from this company on the 0 june_0000 , had a choice to select a delivery day so chose friday 0 june .
2	was pleased as it was a competitive price and would turn_up before my daughter '_s birthday on the 00 june .
2	received a confirmation_email_stating the delivery date of the 0 june along with another tracking email .
2	this tracking email just said from the start to this end of this sorry saga " awaiting shipping ".
2	of course the chiminea didn_'_t arrive , we rang customers services but could never get through , sent emails that were never answered .
2	eventually yesterday morning we rang at 0am and spoke to a very pleasant lady in sales ( customer_services don_'_t open until 0am ).
2	she couldn_'_t help but said she would put a fast track on our email to try sort it out .
2	got a voice message on mobile late_afternoon apologising for the delay and saying that they would send one out straight_away and it would arrive between_0am and 0pm today .
2	we have just had another call from them at 0 . 00 this afternoon saying that it wasn_'_t in stock and wouldn_'_t be getting any more until end of month !
2	we have asked for a refund .
2	but what a waste of everyone '_s time and what terrible customer service .
2	i will certainly not be dealing_with worldstores again
2	ordered on bank_holiday monday and arrived 0_days_later , beautifully_packaged .
2	nothing more to say !
2	excellent .
2	order arrived on time and included a free soft_toy which my dog immediately attacked !
2	would use again .
2	looked online for the part i needed and found yourspares the cheapest by far , arrived swiftly , well_packed to , very pleased .
2	my old washing_machine died last friday_evening about 0 . 00_pm , at that moment i saw an ad on tv for swift delivery and good prices for electricals at ao . com .
2	i went online and found a beko 0kg washing_machine i liked which also had £_00 cashback on it so ordered that at 0pm on friday_night , i could not believe the machine was delivered at 0am the following_morning , i was still in my pj '_s much to the amusement of the delivery guys lol , anyway i can '_t praise enough how superb i think the company is , what they say is what they do , very rare_these days , very impressed indeed .
2	have never bought from animed before but found their website easy and the delivery superfast , will buy from again for sure .
2	pleasant and quick response with all questions_answered .
2	everything was first_class with this company , my glasses are fab , delivery within a couple of days , i needed to send them back which was totaly my fault , customer service was excellent , and the prices very easy on the purse , it does not get any better_than this , perfect !!
2	!
2	i trust supplementwarehouse . com for the lowest_prices every time i order bars and supplements online , and they carry so many great brands .
2	the shipping is a bit of an " ouch !"
2	unless you can either get a shipping special or you take_advantage of their great sale prices and buy a lot at one time .
2	even with the high shipping prices , i do the math and still get a great bargain as long as i buy a lot at once .
2	their closeout prices cannot be beat .
2	we will shop_here again and again .
2	it seems that almost everyone seems to know the name amazon . com , even those who do not deal on - line .
2	i have purchased so many items from them now i have lost_count .
2	i continue to use them as there shopping_experience is second to none , an easy to search and navigate web - site , easy purchasing , and an array of other associated traders to cater for most of ones needs .
2	if there is ever a problem , which is very rare in my experience , it is sorted_out without_any turmoil or blame on the customer , which seems to be the first line of defense from many companies nowadays .
2	amazon . com seem to be getting bigger and bigger and i would put this down to good products , good customer service , and an easy shopping_experience .
2	its true things might go_wrong every now and then , but amazon . com do seem to care about the customer and will offer a variety of options to correct the problem .
2	it i could only use one word to describe amazon . com it would be trustworthy .
2	i was once an_avid customer of maplin , but i then realised many of the products i had purchased from them were just not giving a good life span .
2	my last purchase was two solar panels at about £_000 each , which should have produced a combined 0 amp output .
2	alas , they struggled to give 0 . 0 amps in the brightest of conditions so i complained to them .
2	they would not do anything so i complained to the manufacturer who replaced the panels .
2	unfortunately , even these panels did not produce their full output as specified , but more_importantly the construction was such that when water entered one of the so - called sealed panels it shorted its internal electronics , which in turn shorted the battery bank of three batteries it was charging , completely destroying their charging capability .
2	i did then contact the managing_director of maplin , but even he could not be bothered to reply , so i stopped dealing_with the company , also redirecting all the educational orders i once forwarded to them .
2	in my experience maplin just don_'_t seem to care that much about the customer or customer_satisfaction , so in my book they do not even really warrant one star .
2	i purchase thousands of pounds worth of computer equipment , for work and play , and have dealt_with many on - line retailers , however , over the years ebuyer has stood_out as one of the best .
2	if there is a problem , which is very rare , they arrange_collection of the item , and either replace it or credit the money back to your account .
2	they actually answer e_-_mails which is also a big boost , rather_than just keeping one waiting in limbo , and of course their prices are very competitive .
2	i would highly_recommend this company .
2	i should have been warned off this company from the start when the images on their web - site did not display properly , however , i ordered a liteon blu - ray writer , as documented on their web - site , only to find it was a read only device .
2	i returned the unit as it was not as_described on their web - site , paying the carriage , but because it was not actually faulty kikatek would not re - pay the carriage_costs .
2	i e_- mailed them about this , but then of course they suddenly went silent , and did not respond .
2	i would have spent a lot more with this company as i am_currently upgrading all my computers , but their failure to accept their responsibility just means i went elsewhere .
2	they lost much more that the £ 0 . 00 they still owe me .
2	i would not be able to deal with them again as i now have no faith in this company .
2	after going through the procedures i received the labels to send the phones off but i had to ring them and they advised me that i was quite local to them so they gave_me directions to delivery the phones personally .
2	i immediately got a receipt via_e . mail then in less_than 00hrs the phones were processed and they e . mailed to say that my gift card was in the post .
2	you can '_t fault service like that .
2	i found them to be efficient in every_aspect .
2	i would certainly recommend them .
2	first_class prompt service .
2	i emailed a question about what i needed to send with the phone and it was answered very quickly .
2	regular_emails kept you updated as to what stage things were at .
2	they kept to the estimated worth they had given for my phone .
2	would definitely recommend them .
2	battery_force has all your power needs in one place .
2	search by battery type , size , make or what you want them for .
2	they have special_offers and tend to be chaper than the high_street .
2	all that and delivered right to your door .
2	when i bought the airram , i was a bit_concerned_about the price .
2	i needn_'_t have worried though , it is well_worth_every_penny .
2	people are saying that my bedroom carpet , which is navy_blue and never quite looked cleaned , looks like new !
2	what more can i say , it '_s a great product .
2	" what a fantastic company to deal with , the climbing_frame is brilliant and our grandson and his friends really love it . _thank you dunster house we will recommend you to others .
2	what brilliant service you gave_us - thank_you .
2	i have ordered several_times from temptation_gifts and they are a great company to deal with .
2	their products are fantastic and ordering is so easy .
2	i would recommend them to anyone .
2	serenata_flowers made the whole order easy .
2	they kept in touch with me via_text and email , to keep me up to date with my purchase and its delivery !
2	my mother was absolutely_delighted with her stunning spring bouquet , balloon and card and also by how cheerful and polite the delivery agent was .
2	she said that the quality of the flowers was excellent .
2	i would happily_recommend serenataflowers . com to everyone for quality , price and efficient delivery .... they were fabulous !
2	i like that boiler jiuce let_me know if anyone is buying oil in my area so i have a chance to make savings on my order .
2	they are convenient , quick and most of all their site is easy to use and understand
2	i cannot_fault isme on any front they deliver fast and in good condition they are polite on the phone when i call
2	we needed money to help our daughter get onto the property ladder .
2	we decided on key and found the whole_process very efficient , personal and fast .
2	would recommend to anyone .
2	on trying out my internet speed i found out alot and know who i want to be with now .
2	this is the first time i have used t . 0 . t . d . com , i found the staff very helpful and friendly .
2	they are very quick and the prices are excellent .
2	i did have to ring up for some advice which i got from dave , he explained_everything to me without the jargon or trying to get me to purchase a more_expensive tyre .
2	they gave_me a time_slot that was best for me , their technician explained_everything that he had done , tyres pressures etc , and payment was simple with the chip and pin .
2	i would highly_recommend t . 0 . t . d . com to anyone , for price , service and a job very well_done .
2	thankyou t . o . t . d
2	i wanted cover to colect our new car , but it was bank_holiday_weekend and our broker was closed , so i googled temp motor insurance and found tempcover .
2	it was so easy just a couple of questions and a cheap payment , i even downloaded the cover note there and then .
2	i wish all insurances were like this .
2	try it for yourself and i promise you wont_be dissapointed in them
2	it seems that ballicom had some customer service issues but it also appears that they have done a great deal to addres these issues .
2	the item i ordered was of an excellent quality , a good price and arrived very quickly after being ordered .
2	so the service i received i cannot_fault .
2	poor .
2	poor customer service is more noticable when things go_wrong which is where they seem to have had their problems , lets_hope they concentrate on this side of business .
2	for me , i will be using this company again .
2	found lenstore through search_engine , as i was looking for coopervision brown contact_lenses .
2	they had the perfect colour which i was looking for , placed my order , & received them within a few day '_s .
2	i received e_-_mails to notifiy me of despatch & the del date to be expected .
2	i will be ordering my contact_lenses from lenstore in the future .
2	also would highly_recommend lenstore to my friends .
2	i have also been ripped_off by this so called internet shop !
2	i paid for eyesential product & received an_automated e_- mail informing_me it was out of stock .
2	so i cancelled the order & requested my refund .
2	over 0weeks_ago , & still no response from the thief '_s .
2	i have e_- mailed them daily .
2	they are a scam site .
2	so if you have also been ripped_off by them , report them to consumer_direct , watchdog , & cardiff police , the same as i have done .
2	my bank is now dealing_with these thief '_s .
2	i would recommend this company to anyone .
2	i have recommended this site to numerous people because of their pricing , free_postage and selection of products available to buy .
2	this is a very good company that offers basic insurance_cover for your much loved phones , tech stuff and other prized electrical gadgets .
2	the website is easy to use , but remember this is budget cover so read the policy details to make_sure the product meets your requirements .
2	the policies are activated quickly and the payment_methods are simple to use .
2	they don_'_t charge for installment payments , keeping the costs down .
2	the product i wanted at a price i could not afford to miss .
2	the seller despatched the item immediately and informed me at every possible opportunity .
2	the product was perfectly packed and the paperwork was the first thing i saw when i opened the box .
2	the stereo purchased is for my 0 year_old daughter as part of her xmas_present list .
2	the product itself is ideal for a childs bedroom , it is easy to use with adequate wattage and front usb for mp0 connection .
2	the speakers are perhaps not as good as i would expect from akai , but they are perfectly_adequate for a kids bedroom so as not to get complaints from the neighbours .
2	all in all an excellent purchase from an excellent seller .
2	bumped_into this site searching online .
2	i recently bought a pair of sunglasses from this site which unfortunately didn_'_t suit me .
2	the returns process couldn_'_t have been easier , with the customer_services advisor writing me personalised emails instead of the standard ' cut and paste ' ones .
2	don_'_t worry_about the fact that they are an online store , it is a piece of cake to return things if they don_'_t suit .
2	i love using the print_space as it is so easy to upload to their site and order just prints or finished products too .
2	i love the quality and the fact that i know when i will receive my order .
2	i love my bb products .
2	easy to place any order - receving confirmation and within 00 days ( to denmark ) you have wonderful products og high_quality .
2	i will recommend bb to my friends without hesitating .
2	thank_you beautybay :- o ))

2	we were travelling as a party of 0 .
2	the rooms were very clean and modern .
2	nothing was too much_trouble for the staff .

2	was scrolling_through on - line websites for a solution for thinning_hair , but the product i wanted was expensive .
2	i eventually clicked on to weldricks and was so pleased that they were so much_cheaper_than anyone_else .
2	whenever i want pharmaceuticals i check weldricks first , they are in my favourites !
2	" delivery and packaging were excellent .
2	impressed with the quality ,.
2	i ordered a cover for a deep_mattress which ensured a good fit , but with room for manoeuvre , and that is exactly_what i got .
2	mind you it is just as well no - one could see this 0ft_tall 00 year_old trying to encase a heavy double mattress completely in a zipped cover it must have been some sight !
2	but with the material being soft and silk like it did help a little .
2	next time i think it would be a good idea to get someone to help .
2	thank_you from a very satisfied_customer . "
2	i ' googled ' a specific eyeliner and had looked at a couple of websites so i knew approximately how much i was going to have to spend .
2	i then clicked on beauty_bay their prices were so good i bought 0 .
2	i clicked off and then i thought have a look at other ' stuff ' you buy regularly , so i clicked back on , and yes the prices were great so i bought some more stuff , and stuff i hadn_'_t bought before because of the prices .
2	i am so pleased with the quality price and service .
2	great site , who now has a new regular customer .

2	i have been receiving deliveries from yodel on a regular_basis for over a year and i have never had any_problems , they always deliver exactly when expected and their driver is helpful and cheerful .
2	website easy to navigate , handy conversion tool , made to measure is standard with no_hidden_fees and the price was still cheaper_than other_sites selling the same item .
2	the finish of the curtains was superb .
2	will definitely shop with this company again .
2	had to give one star but would have given them a minus .
2	ordered a toyota hilux invincible black rear wheel arch from them through recommendation from 000spares . co . uk ( another company to avoid ).
2	they said they had the exact item and in mint_condition .
2	when received it was silver and not the correct_part and looked like it had been kicked around the breakers yard , so asked them to collect item and give full_refund of £_000 .
2	guess_what , only got £_000 and after numerous_emails ( don_'_t bother to call as they are on premium_rate so getting more money out of you ) to them and also to the support section of 000spares , i '_ve got nowhere , so looks like i have to write this extra £_00 off .
2	you '_ve been warned .....
2	wanted a new black toyota hilux invincible wheel arch .
2	went through their search_engine and got a quote .
2	brilliant !
2	then it went all downhill after that .
2	got a call from jap parts saying they had the right part and in immaculate_condition at £_000 .
2	so i paid and awaited the item .
2	when it arrived , it was for a different make of toyota , was silver and looked like it had been kicked around the breakers yard .
2	asked for them to collect the item and issue a refund .
2	they wanted us to send it back at our cost originally but i refused and said that as it was their fault , they should arrange a collection , which they did .
2	took photos of the wheel arch for proof of condition and also how it was packaged up so there would be no come_back .
2	waited for the refund and guess_what i only got £_000 back .
2	been backwards and forwards with 000 '_s support which is a joke , they no_longer respond and you just can '_t get_hold of jap parts .
2	don_'_t bother to call as it is premium_rate .
2	i shop at aldi in shipley bradford every now and again and love the surprising extra one off items you can find .
2	however the cheaper shopping_experience should not out way a friendly and welcoming staff , i know they ' re busy and want you through asap , but being rushed by unfriendly staff will put me off returning .
2	ordered 0 kindle covers and they arrived very promptly .
2	they are very good value for money and i especially like the denim one .

2	would recommend *****
2	in the past i have always been pleased with my purchases until the 0st september when my parents_anniversary card turned_up faulty there was a nasty smear across it . i informed customer_services via_email twice and was ignored twice . on my third email they answered me and promised a replacement , however they emailed me to say they had shipped it along with a picture of the card .
2	( the wrong one they had sent my nieces card instead ) however it never came . i emailed them again and they said would i like a refund that was on 00th_sept .. still no refund so i emailed again and they said they had refunded it into my account .. but after checking they clearly have not . it is now the 00th_oct still not received a card or a refund .
2	so if you want good customer service from this company forget it , there quality of cards are very good but when something_goes_wrong their customer service is truly appalling .
2	very speedy delivery , high_quality products at bargain prices , would recommend this company to anyone .
2	i have bought my contact_lenses on the internet for years .
2	and after many_years of using the same supplier i switched to getlenses .
2	i am so glad i did , the service is fantastic .
2	from now on my contact_lens provider will always be getlenses .
2	hi there , i had a slight_problem with getting a delivery collection .

2	easy to order from this company and goods arrived quickly and were well_packed .
2	would i use them again ?
2	most definitely .
2	good range of products .
2	shame you can '_t do more on the pricing side of things for private prescriptions , you ' re still more_expensive than tesco '_s .
2	but full_marks on speed and efficiency of service .
2	fantastic service quick and efficient , fantastic quality and fantastic price .
2	i am really chuffed with all my goods .
2	good accurate_description , fast efficient delivery , just what i needed
2	in march_0000 we stayed at butt hill cottage in troutbeck with lakelovers .
2	the house was quite literally a building site with construction workers starting at 0am every day to replace the roof of the adjoining property .
2	there was constant noise and banging all day and constant traffic .
2	we could not use the garden because of all the debris falling_off the roof , or open the windows and had to keep the curtains upstairs closed because the workers could see into the bedroom .
2	my holiday was ruined and we couldn_'_t wait to leave .
2	three_weeks_later and i still cannot get a response from their md , paul liddell , despite_emailing and calling repeatedly .
2	apart_from that , the house was dusty and not as_described on their website .
2	i would say do not ever book with lakelovers . co . uk .
2	i wish i had never_heard of them .
2	i am so glad i was recommended to use quidco , it directs me towards reputable stores and i am always quidsin !
2	!
2	i have been with printing . com since i started my business , ragglebean glass , 0 years_ago .
2	from the start , my business looked professional .
2	now i '_m doing my first trade_show with , british designer craft trade_show
2	i was struggling with the design of a flyer for my jewellery , it was all in my head .
2	adam was patient and calm and professional , never condescending , or rattled .
2	he pulled the final design together , despite my severe dyslexia and shot nerves .
2	this morning , knock on the door , three boxes of what was in my head on paper .
2	professional , perfect .
2	harrogate here i come !
2	thank_you adam so much

2	have just made my first purchase from outdoorkit .
2	unfortunately , due to my own error , the incorrect item was sent .
2	on contacting customer support received outstanding service .
2	the item was changed immediately on my returning the wrong item .
2	best company for care and support as well as all the products stocked .
2	service is always brilliant and flowers always amazingly beautiful .
2	i have used tr to book a few holidays and only one occasion did i have to wait a week for an answer , which i managed to sort_out myself .
2	they still followed it up though .
2	all other questions were dealt_with almost imediately and all the holidays we have booked have been a lot_cheaper_than any other travel shop .
2	so pleased with it that i will order another one for my son in his room !
2	i '_m so happy i found this site .
2	not only do they have a great selection of product at a terrific price , but they include several free products with your purchase ... including magazine subscriptions .
2	i '_m telling_everyone i know about supplement_warehouse !
2	we booked the best room ( 0 ) in a hotel with a great location .
2	other rooms were small with tables and chairs next to the pool or with terraces walked through by other guests .
2	we did our research and got the best room - at top of hotel with a private terrace with sun_beds .
2	a table and chairs and a jacuzzi .
2	hotel was spotlessly_clean .
2	breakfast was very good - maybe over ambitious for the space available .
2	amazing selection of greek appetizers each morning but they were served cold - chilled not just tepid - which although disappointing for me was correct from a food safety point of view .
2	who does eat cold poached eggs ??
2	?
2	the staff were fantastic - so friendly and nothing was too much_trouble .
2	the hotel was really busy - lots of people staying just a night so cleaning was really important - and they did it well .
2	lovely pool - just a little cold but that was a challenge .
2	only one whinge .
2	0 young girls turned_up and used the pool_area each day .
2	clearly relatives of the staff .
2	they were often noisy and monopolised the small pool when guests wanted - or i wanted to use it .
2	it is a family run hotel but the children were a nuisance with their screams at sunset .
2	the sunset views were amazing
2	we only saw the olympic rep once - she showed us the transfer mini_bus and left us - pretty useless but we didn_'_t want a rep and welcome drinks and all that stuff
2	i recommend this company as they despatched my order promptly and with the free delivery and discount their prices are excellent .
2	the key rep was very helpful answered all our questions and explained_everything in a very understandable way , nothing was too much_trouble and was no_pressure to commit
2	fit well , comfy , quick delivery .
2	great great great
2	of late delivery failure after delivery failure .
2	given a time and date then delivery people ring to say it has not arrived at their depot can not deliver .
2	also lots of items supposedly in stock only to then be told after order accepted not available any more .
2	not as good as it was going down_hill fast , bring back the old crew please at_least they were polite and helpful .
2	am seriously thinking of stopping once i have finished paying what i owe
2	had my son on as a person to speak on my behalf for over 0 years then all of a sudden he is taken off and i have to fill all the paper_work out again .
2	i ordered flowers and balloon for a 00th_birthday on 0 . 0 . 00 to be delivered on 0 . 0 . 00 .
2	they were not delivered at all .
2	despite_numerous e_-_mails from me to them , no reply , and without a direct telephone_number they are not contactable .
2	my order came to £_00 . 00 , the money was taken but they have not got back to me to say why they have not delivered the flowers , or apologise , just nothing .
2	disgraceful and totally_unacceptable .
2	i am writing to them .
2	i will take this further with local media , i want my money back and an_apology .
2	this is an update_: i received a text saying the driver could not gain_access .
2	there was a buzzer at the gate that you press to gain entrance , also serenata claim the driver leaves a card if they have this problem , no card left .
2	the large postbox was at the gate , so no excuse as they didn_'_t need to gain_access to do this small thing .
2	i get the feeling they want to try to re - deliver this again , this is now no good , the flowers will not be fresh enough and the balloon useless .
2	the moment has_gone as the birthday was the 0th not today or tomorrow , no response yet again from my e_-_mails to their own email in - box , just ignored .
2	only a refund will due now , both serenata and yodel are not doing all that is claimed on the website , totally_unacceptable .
2	i expect this update to be ignored as well .
2	0nd update_: finally serenata have sent me a text to say non - delivery , and actually put that on their website as well .
2	this does not help me in the slightest other than tell me what i already know .
2	i have sent a letter which they should receive by monday at the latest , if they do not advise me of a refund i will take this matter up with the local media , i just want my money back please serenata .
2	finally !
2	had a reply for serenata saying how sorry they were and that they had been let_down my their courier .
2	they apologised and offered me a refund , which is all i ever wanted .
2	thankyou serenata .
2	after 00 years of multifocal glasses and lenses i decided 0000 was going to be the year to get my eyes seen to at last .
2	thinking i would save money i had assessments at local high_street shops , but was not impressed with the service and procedures offered , or the fact that treatment , further assessments and operations took place in london which of course all added to the cost of the procedures .
2	i had seen the advert on tv for clarivu for the over 00 '_s and decided to investigate_further and go to an open evening at solent eye_hospital where mr david anderson was doing the presentation .
2	the director of the hospital did a tour of the theatre and rooms used before and after the operations and explained exactly_what_happens on the operation days .
2	it takes_longer to have the drops put in to dilate the pupils that the actual procedure takes which is only about 00_minutes .
2	mr anderson explained about the various procedures on offer and answered questions and confirmed that patients could be offered a mild sedative so they weren_'_t really aware of what was happening to them .
2	in my case i didn_'_t have to worry that i would fidget or move during the procedure !
2	i then booked to have a free assessment on 00th_january and after all the tests had been completed saw mr anderson who confirmed that i had cataracts in both eyes and he decided which lenses would be most suitable for my eye_sight .
2	my requirements were to be able to see at distances - i can now see people walking on the beach at_least 0 / 0 mile from my house .
2	drive and read without glasses / lenses and be able to thread a needle and sew again .
2	he wasn_'_t sure if the later would be possible and i might need glasses to help , but having just done so 00_hours after my second op then both operations have been a complete success .
2	all the team at optegra eye_hospital are excellent , very caring and helpful .
2	the place is immaculately_clean and is more like a 0_* hotel than a hospital .
2	if i had realized how easy , quick & simple the procedure was then i would have had it done a long time ago .
2	i now have the sight back i had as a child so thank_you mr anderson and the team at optegra solent hospital for the miracle of sight that you have given back to me .

2	get lenses are a very good internet site for cointact lenses of all types and solutions .
2	well_worth buying from , good prices and prompt delivery .
2	this order was for a pair of lowa renegades , and they were in exactly the right size , colour and price that i wanted ( often three difficult requirements to fulfil simultaneously ).
2	delivered quickly .
2	i live in a remote_part of the uk and the particular toiletries i favour are either prohibitively_expensive ( the " big " supermarket is shameless ), or unavailable .
2	so i had a peculiarly large order for soap , but it was dealt_with very swiftly and efficiently .
2	the soap was sixty pence cheaper per bar from chemist_direct too .
2	i will use this method of shopping again .
2	the product is so easy to use and with a variety of templates and backgrounds the end_result always looks professional .
2	i have used several online photobook suppliers and whilst photoworld is not hte cheapest it is by ar certainly the best .
2	ordered a 00 page_photobook with a voucher from amazon_local deals .
2	simply downloaded the programme from the website and the rest was very straightforward .
2	you can choose for the programme to design a book automatically , using your selected photos , or , like me , you can be in charge of the design and layout yourself .
2	the user_interface is very comprehensive yet , after a bit of a play , easy to use .
2	a vast_array of page_layouts , borders etc , and every detail seems to be able to be customised according to taste .
2	preview view gives you a clear picture of what the final page will look like .
2	uploading and ordering were simple and straightforward too .
2	i have a reasonably fast internet_connection so didn_'_t take long .
2	useful tip - as the progress of your photo_book is saved locally ( on your pc ), remember to regularly make a back up copy in a second location .
2	my son , who was also compiling a book , had a problem when the pc crashed .
2	his photobook file became corrupt and all his efforts were lost ....... he had to start from scratch .
2	finished_product was fantastic quality ....... the quality of the cover , paper and photos are fabulous .
2	i '_m so impressed i '_ve purchased a second voucher and will be making a second book .
2	would certainly recommend .
2	our family photos generally either sit in an album , box or in a file on the pc .
2	when put in book form , they sit on the coffee_table or in the bookcase and are readily_available to pick_up and browse .
2	i '_m converted :-)
2	purchased an iphone_0s on vodafone for , what was at the time , an unbeatable deal .
2	received the phone and sim very quickly .
2	simple transaction , good communication and no_problems_whatsoever so far .
2	son ordered same phone on same deal from this company , he too has had no_problems and the deal is exceptional value compared to any highstreet deal .
2	would certainly recommend .
2	fast delivery of voiles .
2	all panels exactly as ordered , well made and perfect sizing .
2	good quality .
2	will certainly use again .
2	excellent service at all_stages .
2	great choice of product at great prices .
2	super quality .
2	have had primed , mdf skirting on two occasions .

2	very pleased with service and products .
2	very good value .
2	query with delivery service sorted immediately with friendly and professional customer service .
2	would certainly use again .
2	the best search_engine and e : mail site

2	one of the best companies to buy from on - line
2	very pleased with this company , great service and quick delivery , highly_recomended
2	i live in a rural_location and needed a car , could not find what i wanted locally so found one via_ebay classifieds which was 000_miles_away .
2	i have never bought a vehicle ' remotely ' before , but i thought i would see if i could get the vehicle delivered before i committed to the purchase .
2	i asked for quotes via shiply and had several , which was great .
2	because you can check the feedback of all the delivery people it gives you confidence , and i found a terrific chap , mike ( carcare ) who delivered my car at exactly the time he said .
2	he was brilliant , so many_thanks shiply for enabling_me to get a vehicle easily .
2	it would have cost me as much to use public_transport etc , and the stress !
2	perfect_solution , i would definitely use shiply again .
2	i have just been through a rather protracted and complicated equity_release case due to unknown title restrictions on my property and commend martin sloan of key_retirement_solutions very highly for his diligence and assistance in attaining an excellent deal for me despite these problems which were beyond his control .

2	first purchase , won_'_t be the last .
2	after a successful first order this second one had a couple of issues .
2	however the test of a good company is how well they handle problems and i cannot_fault fringe '_s response .
2	a telephone_call was all that was needed to sort everything out and i am now very pleased with my purchase .
2	having put their customer service to the test , i would say don_'_t_hesitate to use this company .
2	easy to use web_site and quick service .
2	goods were delivered as scheduled and in excellent condition .
2	excellent site
2	i have had a few deliveries by yodel and have always found the drivers very pleasant and always had a smile for the customer .
2	if you are not at home they do their best to leave your parcel as per your wishes if not they put a card through your door and tell you when they will call again or you can go on the website and reschedule your delivery . an excellent service .
2	i have enjoyed shopping with very , they have competetive_prices and a very good delivery service .

2	i placed two orders late evening and received emails and texts almost_immediately to say the order had been received .
2	next_morning i had emails and texts again to say the flowers had set off to my two friends .
2	within an_hour one bunch had been delivered and an_hour after that the other had also been received .
2	sara replied " omg they ' re fabulous " together with a picture of the amazingly blue_orchids .
2	after work i received another " omg message from sylvia who received the pink orchids ".
2	both friends are very chuffed with their surprise flowers .
2	i chose total_computing for my purchase because i always like to read what everybody else thinks and it was all good !
2	i ordered on line which was quick and easy - the product i wanted was very competitively_priced and the delivery of the item was speedy .
2	a good all_round experience - just what i expect when i am ordering on - line .
2	just what i am looking for from an internet - based company - excellent communication , easy ordering system , the item i want in stock , delivery free of charge and delivered not only within 0_days but within the hour they specified .
2	fantastic job .
2	i hope the after sales service will be as efficient !
2	i had researched annuities on the internet and had a good idea of the amount i would be able to obtain but then went through age_partnership and spoke to scott wrega .
2	he was very helpful and thorough and managed to get a better rate than i was able to find .
2	the whole_process was very quick and the form_filling made really simple because he highlighted all the boxes i needed to complete .
2	i would certainly recommend them .
2	felicity lenk customer reference no 000000
2	ordered a card for a special person on the friday and paid the £ 0 . 00 to guarantee delivery on the saturday , guess_what no delivery so no card , im very angry about this as what is the point in paying £ 0 , 00 for a guaranteed delivery and it doesnt come , i had to rush out to the shops for a run of the mill birthday card , not good enough moonpig , then to top it off no staff of a weekend
2	great range of products and fantastic prices .
2	delivery very fast and returns dealt_with very efficiently .
2	i live in canada , and have family and freinds in the uk , i have used quite a few online gift services , but temptations are now my first choice , great range and great pricing and the delivery was as indicated on the order confirmation_email and also the email that my informed me my gift had been dispatched .
2	went in to look at a prs but was unsure if it was the one for me , was left to try it alone upstairs , no pushy_sales men just genuine helpful staff .
2	if carlsberg made guitar shops !
2	probably the best guitar shop in the northeast .
2	good product , excellent value .
2	very efficient service and delivery .
2	what can i say ?
2	i ordered my keen 00 months_ago , it was after 0pm and they arrived the following_morning !
2	unfortunately after 00 months they developed a fault and within a week of e_- mailing webtogs they phoned to say they had been in touch with keen who agreed to replace them .
2	they e_- mailed me a pre_- paid postage slip and within 0_days of posting them my brand_new pair arrived !

2	i am pleased to recommend mytuxedo .
2	i must tell everyone about the place i get my pets_medication , they are half the price of the vets , the service is second to none , the tablets always arrive in 00_hours and the people at the end of the phone are so friendly and helpful , when i ring they know immediately who i am , what tablets i need and how i pay , they update me on everything that happens at viovet its all posted onto my pc for me , even reminds_me when they will be closed so i do not forget the very important tablets for my poor sick doggies , i was very impressed when the olympics were about to start and viovet emailed me to tell me to order early in case the post was held up , that was so good of them , yes to say viovet impresses me is an_understatement , as i commented at the top of this , they are " simply the best " so thanks a million to you all at viovet , you are now more like my friends when i place an order or ring for help `, you never , ever let_me down , keep_up the good service
2	knew one of the products i ordered wasn_'_t in stock .
2	but both items still arrived really quickly and was exactly as_described .
2	website was easy to navigate , so all in all a happy_bunny ....
2	what a lovely quality quilt , so bouncy , lite and soft , feels incredibly luxurious and very warm too .
2	very good value for money , i did lots of research before buying this one and am really over the moon with it .
2	will be trying there sheets next !
2	this is the third time i have used mattressman & each time there has_been very fast delivery , the products have arrived in good condition and are amazing value for money .
2	this was an easy site to search to find just what i was looking for at a competitive price .
2	delivery was fast and efficient .
2	i '_m really pleased with the quality of the products ( which is not always easy to assess on the web ).
2	thanks , i shall use this company again .
2	fantastic bedroom_furniture
2	fantastic service from the showroom through to delivery .
2	bedroom looks amazing
2	brought a hillman golf_trolley for my husband '_s birthday feb_0000 it has broken down more times than it '_s been on the golf_course !
2	finally after being sent replacement_parts twice the trolley has_been returned to uk sports_imports , their customer service is shocking we have been told the battery is faulty and not covered by the warranty and they want £_00 . 00 to replace the battery !
2	we had the battery tested and it was fully charged !
2	after_spending £_000 . 00 on a trolley that has only been on the course twice do i want to throw good money after bad !
2	very pleased would recomend
2	would recoment skiddle . com for tickets .
2	i only had talk_talk phone and broadband and in 0 month i have been charged over_£_000_pound when i disputed this i was told they couldn_'_t understand_why and would look into it but after nyumrous call nothing was done so i requested the service be disconnected which they did then sent me another bill for £_00 so in total less_than 0_months with this company cost over_£_000 i have disputed this with them to no_avail .
2	i would never go back to talk_talk think very carefully before choosing them .
2	a friend suggested i try oakfurnitureland when i was looking for a new dinning_table and chairs .
2	unable to get to one of their shops through sheer lack of time i took a chance and ordered unseen on - line , something i would never normally do !
2	well , they certainly came up_trumps .
2	over the moon with the quality of the product , delivery service and communication from the company .
2	well_done , so impressed i have now ordered a new computer_desk !
2	!
2	no_hesitation in using this company again
2	very easy to book , waiting at airport when we arrived - arrived 00 .
2	minutes early on for our return , great if your a panicker like me .
2	!
2	really quick delivery , thrilled with my order .
2	website was easy to use and my order arrived the next_day , nicely_packaged .
2	i ordered embroidery_thread ( i had the shade numbers ) and it was much_easier to order online than trying to find the right numbers in a shop !
2	really pleased and will be ordering again soon .
2	i ordered prescription_sunglasses on 0th_may - frames showed as " in stock " on the website when i ordered .
2	i received an_email_confirmation on 0th_may confirming the frames were in stock and being moved from the warehouse to the laboratory - bit odd as the website had said they were in stock already .
2	then had an_email on 00th_may to say they had received the frames from the supplier , so they weren_'_t ever in stock in the first place !
2	i then had no further communication from them until i contacted them on 00st_may to ask for progress as the website still showed my order as " processing " .
2	i received the following reply on 0st june : " we are extremely sorry for the delay .
2	there was a delay as the glasses as a 0st set of lenses had failed quality checks and we had to reorder another pair of the lenses .
2	we can confirm that the order is being_processed and your order will be dispatched asap ."
2	no very asap as i heard_nothing further until i contacted them yesterday when the website still showed " processing ".
2	a webchat then revealed that they had dispatched the glasses ( no notification to me ) and they tried to say that it was my fault for not being in to receive a delivery - no card from the couriers , no delivery attempted !
2	glasses finally arrived this morning and as i picked them up from the case , a lens fell out !
2	beyond_belief !
2	so , truly abysmal service , order took far too long ( the website says five working_days , but possibly up to 00 days ), shoddy workmanship .
2	don_'_t use this website !
2	!
2	almost twice cheaper_than the same service if you order direct from the carrier .
2	excellent customer service - i would like to thank emily , who helped_me to process my collection order today :)
2	i ordered 0gb of ram to upgrade my mid 0000 00 " macbook_pro at 0pm and requested the free ( slowest ) delivery option .
2	i got an_immediate e_- mail to confirm my order .
2	about an_hour later i got a second e_- mail to say my order had been picked and packed and was on its way .
2	i had the ram fitted by 00 . 00 the following_morning .
2	amazingly efficient service and at a great price too .
2	highly_recommended .
2	gak came out tops when i googled marshall as00d so i feared the usual impersonal site .
2	how wrong i was .
2	a real_person , with a name and in - depth_knowledge of the gear .
2	the best on - line price , straightforward on - line finance application with instant decision , e_- mail notification of each_stage and delivery when i wanted it .
2	perfect
2	i ordered my panasonic lx0 from simply_electronics on 0th_nov as they had the lowest_price and free delivery .
2	delivery was due in 0 - 0_days and they provided a tracking_number so i could view progress .
2	on the 0th_nov i got an e_- mail to say my order had been upgraded to next_day delivery at no extra_cost .
2	on the 0th i checked the tracking_number and was told the package was on the van and was likely to be delivered between 0000 and 0000 .
2	it arrived on time .
2	excellent price , excellent service .
2	i would most definatley use wallpaper_direct again ,
2	so easy to use and so efficient wallpaper arrived next_day and i was kept_informed from the minute i processed my order
2	top_marks
2	its so refreshing to deal withe a very very efficient company and would gladly do_business with them again .
2	flight case super_duper and arrived very well_packaged and in under 0_days , thankyou very much and we will certainly recommend you to others
2	i would have no_hesitation in recommending allbeauty . com .
2	goods arrived very quickly , well_packaged and just as_described on site .
2	just returned from fuengirola , costa_del sol and used_resorthoppa for transport to and from malaga_airport .
2	only 0 of us picked_up at malaga so a taxi was provided , and on return we had 0 pick_ups , so a mini_bus was provided .
2	no waiting around , pick_up at time stated - comfortable , clean transport and courteous drivers .
2	couldn_'_t fault it at all .
2	have also used_resorthoppa in benidorm for transport from alicante_airport with equally satisfactory results .
2	would recommend this company to friends and family without_hesitation .
2	i '_ve just added the passbook app to my iphone , and tried to store my booking confirmation from essential_travel in it .
2	however , the email_confirmation didn_'_t contain the necessary " blue button " to enable this .
2	i emailed the company , and had an_immediate_response from nina montgomery , who rapidly solved my problem , with help from the it team .
2	when the replacement confirmation arrived , it was displaying the wrong airport , so again i contacted nina , who got it changed and sent another replacement confirmation , this time displaying the correct airport .
2	as with any new technology , there are bound to be teething difficulties , and in no way would i complain_about this .
2	however , i was extremely impressed by the speed and genuine warmth of nina '_s responses , which extended to a goodwill refund of the parking charge as a " thank_you " for alerting the team to the problem .
2	if that '_s not first_class customer service , i '_d like to know what is ?!
2	well_done , essential_travel , you have a diamond employee .
2	thank_you nina , i hope you get the recognition you deserve .
2	it was the best thing when i left bt and cheaper
2	i dont trust this site used them before when my account was closed i kept getting emails_telling my i owe them money which i never did my account was clear this went one for a while so i stay well clear
2	im not happy with this company the reason_why is down to the way they treated my neighbour ,
2	she ask me to book her a flight to irleand she is in her 00s she flew out a day before she cam home she was told that her flight was delayed and to go to the airport which she did , the person she spoke to said if she wanted another flight it would cost her over a £_000_pounds which was a lot so it was a case of stay in the airport or pay
2	tesco isnt like it used to be its lost its customer_sevices mind you im not sure it had any to start with , they must think there customers are stupid to fall for there so called price drop and there programmed to say im_sorry to hear that drives me nuts i come the end of the year my club card goes in the shredder and my nectar_card gets a boost
2	i fill robbed every time i buy my licence fee i dont have much to watch 0 / 0 programs in the morning if im really lucky and i mean really i may find some thing to watch on bbc 0 or 0 , and now ive got my husband moaning there not showing the full f0 races , and if that wasnt bad enough its the sports that take place over any thing else and it has to been showen on more then one channel drives me mad drop the fee once and for all i can think what to do with £_000 thats for sure
2	give them a wide_berth ,
2	i am very pleased with product , stylish look and functional .
2	service was excellent .
2	would certainly use this retailer again .
2	the product purchased was also excellent value and has meant i am no_longer drowning a painted wall when i shower .
2	thank_you
2	ordered a number of batteries for childrens_toys for christmas .
2	good quality product received , value for money .

2	after arriving home from work i checked to see status of my order via_amazon then was shocked to read that yodel had delivered my item today to porch ??
2	what is a concern is that my porch was closed and windows closed as i work !!
2	i immediatly contacted yodel and put in query wheres my stuff ??
2	i was informed that item delivered on left on porch !!
2	im_sure u can apprciate my language then to this shabby courier service .. yodel then stated amazons fault as theyve delivered as requested ??
2	i then stated surely someone with a brain would realise if no one in and item too_big to go through window ( if was open ) then they should have re attempted to deliver !!
2	no apparantly they left on porch ???
2	which basically means they left my goods on full_view for anyone to see and remove !!
2	i hasten to add no cards or anything left either ..
2	i have logged this with yodel and amazon and obviously amazon will kindly replace but surely to god ( sorry ) any person with a brain wouldnt leave goods on doorstep .. apparantly driver to be interviewed grrrrrrrrr i wish i was there cos he or she would get a piece of my mind .... a very disruntled customer :-(
2	the items i ordered arrived quickly

2	found some products on here that i haven_'_t seen in the high_street shops , couldn_'_t_believe_how good the prices are , when i think what i '_ve paid for similar products elsewhere !

2	phoned number we were given for problems with room which cost 00_euros to be told they couldn_'_t do anything about it that day as they were finishing for the day !
2	was told we would defiantly get a phone_call the day later but are still_waiting !!!
2	really spoiled our new year !
2	!
2	i live_alone and so have cover from boiler , rads , drains , electrics etc etc
2	i have always had immediate_responses to telephone_calls , rapid call out service , on the spot problems resolved .
2	in past year new water tanks in loft , boiler service , call out to electrics and new heating tank - all in the price .
2	worth it '_s , weight in gold !
2	!
2	their services was spot_on .
2	i had bought a barbour as a present a couple of months before i gave it as a , present .
2	mi hand ordered a , size too small .
2	i was able to exchange easily and with no_fuss .
2	i would definitely recommend this company to others and will be using , them again .
2	i ordered cottonwood curtains for my patio and bay_windows costing_£ 0 , 000 .
2	the process was not easy , the sales_team were cold and not customer friendly or helpful ....
2	i should have heeded my initial instinct .
2	i did point out at the , time that i did not feel as if i was a valued_customer .
2	i run two nationwide companies so i know what good customer service is .
2	i called to cancel after two working_days as the swatch came and the colour said not match the description ..
2	they said there would be a 00_% charge (£_000 )!!
2	as the length of cloth had already been cut .
2	i said ' then i will have the fabric as i had paid for it '.
2	they insisted that they would still make up the curtains that they will clearly sell on .
2	so i bought the fabric - they sell on at a profit .
2	.......
2	i feel robbed !!
2	....... £_000 is lot out of my pension for nothing in return .
2	they have profitted out of me .
2	disgraceful to the extreme .
2	on 00th_november i used parcel to go to post a parcel using yodel as the delivery company ( parcel to go and yodel are the same ) it was a 00 hour delivery that cost just under_£_00 . 00
2	on tuesday the 00th_november i received an_email ( being a business my details were on the label ) from a business in whitechapel london telling_me they had received a parcel address to my customer in essex delivered the their business describing the contents and name and address of the customer the parcel was supposed to go .
2	i spoke to lauren at parcels to go eventually at 0 . 00pm on the 00th who explained that my parcel was in a depot in vauxhall , after_reading her the email from the person it was delivered to i was told an investigation would be opened the delivery driver would be contacted and an_email had been sent to yodel for them to contact me . i have rang yodel everyday speaking to a different person_who always tell me the same thing parcel at vauxhall someone will contact me to arrange a collection on friday 00nd i told them i was not getting off the phone until a collection had been arranged for my parcel to be picked_up from the wrong_address and be sent to right address .
2	a collection was arranged for monday 00th i wont go into names and times of calls i contacted the business who has my parcel to check collection had been made on the 00th as my customer still had not received it .
2	and guess_what it had not been collected .
2	so again the frustrating act of having to call yodel who spent no time at all telling_me that my problem is with parcel to go and not yodel ( one and the same ) who had been trying to contact me via phone and email ( lies i am housebound and have answer machines on both my house phone and mobile plus email addresses ) after much pushing i eventually got a number to ring parcels to go and spoke to lauren again who informed me that my parcel was at vauxhall depot an investigation would be opened and someone from yodel would call me , i told her i knew that i would not get a call from anyone she gave her word that they would .
2	( guess_what they never called ) i am now taking_legal_advice and will be issuing both companies with claims for the cost my parcel , my time , cost of my calls and damages to my business .
2	as well as court costs .
2	i fail to understand how a parcel can be delivered to an address that is not even on the parcel or in the same county or why it is so hard for that said parcel to be collected and delivered to the correct_address .
2	avoid yodel and parcels to go at all costs .
2	but at_least they live up to their name my parcel has defiantly gone .
2	i do not want to receive any more apologies lies or promises the small_claims court can do my talking .
2	i found this site by_accident and i am so glad i did amazing costumes , fast delivery , great service , nothing more to say .
2	after booking a slot with said company i had a query , so i saw live_chat box , clicked on it and a got sammi taylor who was very good in her assistance and replied with no_problems .
2	well_mannered and positive response for her .
2	very pleased with the chat service .
2	thanks
2	i went on line and decided to use a courier service i had not heard of before as i don_'_t often use couriers , of course i had my reservations with all the stories you hear about lost goods , late deliveries , but it was very good , straight_forward in completing the order online , then the collection and delivery were quick and early delivered .
2	i was very pleased and will use this service again with confidence and would definitely recommend them .
2	if i were to describe them in a few words i would say they are ' efficient and cost_effective ' what more could you want !
2	as a first time user of this van hire service i expected something complicated with hiring the vehicle , door operating and key set_up but everything was simplistic ... what i really liked about it was that the vehicle was near home , easy to use , i could take it at the time i wanted throughout the day , drop it off when i liked as long as i was in my hire timeframe .
2	i was really impressed with their speedy service and the wonders of technology used .
2	will definitely use the service again and again .
2	great thanks .
2	received my product next_day within the 0 hour time_slot , in perfect_condition .
2	cheapest price on the internet with free delivery .
2	customer service was also excellent in answering my queries before i purchased .
2	have since purchased other items with no_problems .
2	i would highly_recommend babythings0u to everyone .
2	after ordering and getting the confirmation showing the tyres were being delivered from germany , i wasn_'_t sure if they '_d turn_up within the specified timeframe_given of up to a week .
2	my order went in at 0pm on tuesday and the tyres were despatched the next_day with a link to trace for dpd delivery .
2	in the event the tyres came at mid - day on friday , before i '_d even checked the dpd link , so a brilliant service .
2	being_able to get good prices from all major airlines at one go simplifies the task .
2	with the ability to specify direct flights only many airlines are taken out of the equation .
2	it is a real - time search , so results can vary .
2	if you spot a good deal as i did , then grab it quickly !
2	we '_ve been renting through usrentacar for many_years .
2	we '_ve never had any_issues with the vouchers they give and we ' re never asked to pay anything extra .
2	everytime we check the prices for several other_websites , but they never manage to get near the price .
2	so not only a great price but when our circumstances have changed they '_ve been easy to contact and the changes made quickly and easily .
2	basically they ' re just great .
2	very satisfied with speed of delivery and the quality item i received .
2	swift response to my order was matched by personal care via emails to ensure i was satisfied .
2	felt like i was their favourite customer , thank_you hello_canvas .
2	we are delighted with the standard of the picture .
2	i had been trying to find a particular_brand and size of wellington and could find plenty in small sizes and the wrong_colour but not what i wanted - i even went into the outlet store of the manufacturer and a very helpful lady tried to track some down but to no_avail , in fact she said they weren_'_t showing on her system at all !!
2	so , more in hope than expectation , i sent an e_- mail off to your company to enquire if you could track any down for me and was amazed and delighted when i had a phone_call from a young_man telling_me he had sourced the exact pair i had coveted .
2	i immediately placed an order and the next_day they were delivered , beautifully_boxed and just in time for the deluge of snow we had overnight .
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending your company for it '_s excellent customer service , range and quality of products and your ability to inform customers about the progress of their order .
2	this is the first order i have placed with you - athough my husband and our daughter have purchased some very good , quality items before - it won_'_t be my last .
2	your company is a shining beacon in todays mediocre firms .
2	ordered this product after_reading the reviews and have been delighted with it , although the great british summer has let us down recently , we will be getting maximum use soon .
2	very good build quality and relatively simple to put_together .
2	easy to clean after use too .
2	will be put to good use in the upcoming good weather .
2	the company were polite and friendly and easy to deal with and i would have no_hesitation in using them again or recommending them to friends .
2	on 00th_july was looking for phone for my 00 year_old as he had broken his screen on samsung_s0 , and as hes on contract needed to replace asap , so we looked on cash_converters website , he found a nokia_lumia 000 priced at £_00 , i knew this was incorrect price , so i gave him my card and we paid for it straight_away .
2	surprise_surprise on monday_morning i get an_email from cash_converters , saying that this phone had been sold in the store over the weekend and the website hadnt been updated .
2	this was utter bullshit , they realised they had made an_error with the price and wouldnt honour it , so come up with this rubbish about being sold in store .
2	i emailed them straight back and never_heard from them again .
2	so wouldnt ever have anything to do with this company again
2	shiply is a brilliant company making arranging your collections and deliveries a painless experience .

2	ordered ghd_air hairdryer , phoned them and was told city_link would deliver following_day , waited in all day , no delivery , emailed them twice but no reply , day after i emailed them to say due not receiving the item and no communication i was going to contact pay_pal .
2	i shortly had an_email back to say " due to my rude email they were cancelling my order ".
2	i telephoned them to say i think i was well within my rights to know where my paid item was and that i was not a rude person , i was then told they actually did not have any in stock and that was why my order was cancelled .
2	delivered items ordered quickly and effiiciently
2	efficient , helpful , customer service and delivery .
2	quality products .
2	good product , good service thanks

2	perfect service .
2	wonderful product , personal contact .
2	if i get the money , i '_d do it again :)
2	this company offer a really good array of items to make life_easier for disabled people .
2	my husband has problems eating and drinking because of his ancer , i have found lots of items to make life_easier nd preserve his dignity for that i am very great full .
2	the products i brought are both well_designed , well made and practical .
2	i would recommend them .
2	i bought a sideboard , from the moment i ordered it online the service was faultless .
2	the delivery was arranged by phone and email update .
2	everything went_smoothly and the sideboard was delivered as arranged an to the room we wanted it , we asked that the item was left packed because we had not quite finished_decorating , the delivery guys gave_us clear_instructions for safely unpacking when we were ready .
2	now the sideboard is unpacked and in place , what a fabulous piece of furnature , heavy , solid and just what we wanted .
2	the only_regret i have is not discovering oak_furnature land earlier , we are still_waiting for the table and chairs we ordered from harvey '_s still will be for another month .
2	in future if i need furnature i '_ll be going to oak_furnature land .
2	i have always purchased from high_street_opticians untill an offer from specky_four eyes tempted me to try on line , and the service was so good that i will never purchase from the high_street again .
2	i did have a bit of a glitch with my order as the frames i ordered were out of stock , but was contacted by email to informe me and another pair selected , which came without problem .
2	the whole_experience was very good , i have recommended the company to all my four eyed friends :)
2	bingocams is the best bingo site i have ever played at , they give you bonus money at_least twice a week even if you havent deposited any money with them , the site is very easy to navigate , but help is never far away should you need it , the chathosts are so friendly and very witty , they interact with the players well , and often they give you the chance to earn bonus money in the game , there are many rooms to play in , choose from 00 ball or 00 ball rooms , you dont even have to have a webcam to play , you have nothing to loose by joining , i actually win on bingocams and thats_why i love playing there ,, and it is definitely live bingo at its best thats better_than all the rest
2	the last order was somewhat rushed and i needed the items within 0_days so they were at school for the final assembly .
2	trophy_store were amazing and got them to us the day before the assembly .
2	the trophies were great and the kids_loved them .
2	i had spent weeks trying to find a pharmacy skin product i have been using for more than twenty_five years that had been suddenly discontinued .
2	i exhaustively searched the high_street with no luck so i decided to try the internet and finally found this company who still had a supply in stock .
2	i was delighted to be able to purchase a large_quantity on a special_offer price , with the combined cost of the items plus delivery working out cheaper_than if i had purchased the same amount from the chemists .
2	this will alleviate the stress and give me the time i need to find an_alternative brand .
2	i found this site very easy to register , navigate and order from .
2	i received my items very quickly and securely_packaged so will not_hesitate to purchase from ' pharmacy0u ' in future !
2	excellent and courteous service .
2	i received my items quicker_than_expected .
2	very well_packed , in sound condition and fantastic value .
2	i had good communication by emails to inform_me in respect of ie .
2	one item out of stock ( which i was able to aquire on another site which arrived on the same day !)
2	and one item delayed ( and a reasurance of no extra postage charge ).
2	my daughter was disappointed that a lot of the items on the site were out of stock for her goldfish " doctor " & " amy " and her new hamster " angel ", but i was secretly relieved as we had ordered enough to furnish a " hamster heaven "!
2	i will definitely use this seller in future .
2	thank_you .
2	this is the first time that i have used the national_tyres and autocare website and wow was i amazed_at how easy it was .
2	to the inputting of my car_registration_number and selecting the right tyres for my budget to the booking and payment process .
2	highly_recommended to all :)
2	beware of this company , 0 items they sent me were broken , because i had paid for the items and not on account , they were not interested , parcels never arrived , i had to chase_up yodel , as they would not !!!!
2	rude_unhelpful ..... hanging up on me for asking why they would send out faulty electrical goods .... i have never ever_encountered such rudeness and nastiness from a company , go and learn some customer service skills from amazon !!!
2	would never shop_here again .... disgraceful !
2	wont answer emails , worst shopping_experience ever !
2	do not use this company , disgusting rip_off !!!!!
2	reduced offer from £_00 . 00 to £_00 . 00 .... this company is a scam , do not use !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2	worst experience ever !!!!
2	!
2	thank_you so very much glasses_direct , im over the moon with my varifocals and my single_vision ...... after being_messed_around by specsavers and coming away disgusted , on price and appalling service , i decided to give glasses_direct a go .....
2	i '_m so pleased i did , the varifocals are amazing , no more keep changing glasses ( i use computer a lot , and was having to keep changing for close work )... these varifocals fit like a glove and a joy to wear , brilliant service , even checking an old pair of my glasses for exact_measurements , super prompt return ..... kept me updated all the way through ....... the high_street could really learn a thing or 0 from you guys ...... thanks again , i will be buying all future prescriptions from you ..... my boyfriend is so impressed he will also be buying from you too :)
2	notification of shipping was prompt , so was delivery , and the goods were described well on their website .
2	i came_across alpharooms . com whilst looking for a hotel in london last_year ... we have used the same hotel ( london_bridge ') and alpharooms , three_times since then !
2	!
2	booking online is simple , straightforward and efficient , the prices are the cheapest i can find for this hotel - and on arrival , check - in is quick , professional and hassle - free !
2	i will_continue to use alpharooms for reserving my weekend_breaks at home ... and will certainly give them a try for my foreign travel_arrangements too - with complete_confidence !!
2	!
2	this firm is highly_recommended .
2	they delivered goods in less_than 00hours notice at a time when 0 other_companies had consistently let_me down .

2	thank_you .
2	good company to order from as they send your order out quickly .
2	with very reasonable_prices and they have great offers on to ..
2	great to be able to get my favourite_perfume at a better price & to be able to try new cosmetics at a low price .
2	loved the slim line stainless_steel salt & pepper set ., it has a holder for them to sit in .
2	which is a great idea , as it catches any stray grains .
2	i always buy from fragrance_direct , because of the above .
2	i have always found the items i require very easily and find the website easy to use .
2	the delivery times from order are usually very fast .
2	these puzzles were a lot better then i expected .
2	they are made of tough plastic and my four year_old_grandson loved them .
2	also the price was really good as was the delivery .
2	i would recommend you go to dfs the service is great , the people are friendly and really know what they are talking_about as well as really helping you find the right furniture for your needs .
2	if you want high_quality tools at a good price this is the site to use .
2	i had lost my glasses and prescription glasses here without the health fund rebate are so expensive .
2	my friend recommended selectspecs and it was so easy to enter my prescription .
2	the glasses arrived a few_weeks_later .
2	they looked as good as they did online , fitted_perfectly and were a quarter of the price i would have had to pay in the optician .
2	my son chris told me about mazuma .
2	otherwise i would have just put the old_phones into the recycling .
2	i would not have know about them otherwise so i want to know where do you advertise ?
2	well it does what it says it '_s going to do for the best price that i could find on the web .
2	quick and easy .
2	the only_thing that could be done to improve the service is free_postage .
2	no_probs whatsoever , quick delivery .
2	would use again .
2	my friend and i have been looking for abba cat costumes .
2	only site that had them for sale ( not hire ) and in stock .
2	i ordered them on friday and they arrived following thursday .
2	why am i excited - because i live in australia !
2	we also ordered white boots at the same time from a costume site in australia and they have only just been dispatched so allfancydress wins hands_down .
2	will definitely look again should i need costumes in the future .
2	questions by email always answered_promptly and i was very confident that the costumes would arrive in time for our party ( which they did ) with more than enough time to spare .
2	three_weeks before a friend '_s wedding day , i ordered some flowers from iflorist to be delivered in the us .
2	i was informed that they could not deliver on the day , a saturday , so i accepted the delivery to be done the day before .
2	iflorist then confirmed my order for friday december 00th .
2	imagine my dismay when on friday december 00th i received an_email from iflorist informing_me that they were not able to deliver my order before january 0th !
2	they offered to enclose an_apology with the delivery and offered me a £ 0 credit towards a future order as compensation .
2	i then emailed my friend to ask if she would be at home on january 0th .
2	which she confirmed she would be .
2	imagine my disgust when i received an_email from my friend to tell me that she had waited in the whole day and had received a phone_call from " in full_bloom _ park city " early that evening informing her that they would deliver her flowers that evening .
2	my friend explained that she was going out and was then rudely_told that it was up to her but they could always cancel the order , which my friend then promptly did .
2	what was supposed to be a nice_surprise on a wedding day ended_up causing disappointment , frustration and outright fury !
2	it is a long time since i have felt so angry !
2	it goes without saying that i will never ever use iflorist again !
2	sarah_hayes was just wonderful .
2	she is fast and efficient and very helpful .
2	damien '_s removal company were excellent .
2	he and his work mate were so good and so kind in the removal of my mothers piano from my home to hers .
2	they couldn_'_t have been more helpful and considerate and , as i told them on the day , " they had made an old lady very happy indeed to have her piano back "!!
2	it was a birthday_present and she was thrilled .
2	thank_you damien .... i will have no_hesitation in recommending your company for the removal of anything , large or small !!
2	excellent service and at a very competitive price .
2	thank_you again !
2	excellent site with everything you could need
2	trying to get in touch with these people is like trying to get in touch with god but then again he answers sometimes disgraceful customer service wish_id never joined them

2	great customer service , reliable and efficient .... what more could you want ?

2	excellent team
2	i placed my order after 00 . 00_hrs & it was immediately acknowledged .
2	the online order process was straightforward .
2	i did not need , or expect , next_day delivery of the stand , because i had ordered it in the evening .
2	next_day , at about 00 . 00_hrs , i received an emailed order update & at 00 . 00 i received a further email to say that the stand had been despatched .
2	early , the following_morning , the stand was delivered .
2	there were some minor_issues with the assembly of the off the wall , origin 00 no . 0 stand , but nothing that was not easily overcome .
2	we are delighted with the appearance of our new stand .
2	unfortunately we have had a serious problem with the new lg_tv which has meant that it has had to be replaced .
2	we are still_waiting for this to happen .........
2	you can '_t win them all .
2	this was our 0rd car_rental via rentalcars in 0 years .
2	in each case from stansted .
2	rentals nos .
2	0 & 0 went very smoothly & we were also happy with the service from enterprise in 0000 .
2	the previous rental in july_0000 ) was handled well by rentalcars , but probably because we arrived at_stansted late at night & didn_'_t pick_up the car until well after midnight when all the car lots are closed , our experience with alamo on this occasion was not great .
2	there were no staff still on duty at the alamo depot , despite the fact that europcars / alamo alone advertise after hours pickups at_stansted .
2	this meant that because of an initial poor handover at the airport_terminal desk , we had to go back to this desk in the terminal & time was wasted .
2	also the car model itself was not good .
2	it would be nice if you could select the model of your choice or at_least say what you don_'_t want .
2	in comparison our latest experience with the same hirer at_stansted was all good & the model we were allocated was much_better_than_expected , vw_golf 0 litre turbo diesel .
2	both rentalcars & alamo were able to accomodate our request for a different drop_off location #
2	, later extension of rental by 0_days & finally a revised drop_off point tomorrow , from that originally selected .
2	00 / 00 to alamo for this .
2	fantastic service .
2	couldn_'_t_believe it when my parcel arrived on tuesday when i ordered on saturday .
2	my supplements were carefully_wrapped in bubble_wrap .
2	will definitely be recommending to my friends .
2	i found that printerland '_s service was excellent , from the initial web order to the next_day delivery and the immediate email of the confirmation and final invoice .
2	i have ordered printers and cartridges in the past and the service has always been faltless .
2	i would definitely recommend them .
2	i have had to contact support a few_times whilst setting_up my website , they have responded same day every time with constructive advice .
2	i am really impressed with the support of this company and will only ever use them .
2	always receive good service with this company , delivery is very quick and prices are reasonable
2	i don_'_t normally do fancy_dress , never feel comfortable in it , so this costume was a bit of a compromise for me .
2	when it came and i tried it on - i love it !
2	felt really comfortable , its something i would wear anyway ( without the bone pattern of course !)
2	yet it still fits in with the halloween theme .
2	was also concerned_about what size to order as these costumes can come up small outfit fitted_perfectly - very true to size , can '_t wait to wear it to my parties
2	we have three cats and a standard poodle . have used viovet for three yrs .
2	now and excellent service , speedy and free delivery for our little menagerie . highly_recommended . sue and eve at co . durham

2	j ' ai_acheté des_produits assos ( cagoule ) et gants fugu ( ceux - ci à 0 / 0 prix ). un tout grand bravo aussi pour_la réactivité de_l ' équipe .
2	l ' emballage est parfait et_l ' envoi_rapide .
2	habitant en belgique , j ' ai_reçu ma_commande en 0_jours .
2	une suggestion : pourquoi ne pas faire bénéficier les clients étrangers du service " mondial relay ",.
2	victime de problèmes d ' allergies , j ' ai cherché des cuissards , dépensant des fortunes en marques très chères . sans succès . c ' est par hasard que_j ' ai découvert la marque dhb . j ' ai_acheté les cuissards dhb aeron pro et dhb aeron race il_y a 0 ans .
2	plus aucun souci !
2	ils sont confortables , les peaux sont_très_bien ventilées .
2	de plus , le_prix est renversant .
2	si je constate la_qualité de_ces cuissards , je dirais que_le_prix est ridiculement bas , surtout en cette période de soldes .
2	j ' en ai d ' ailleurs profité pour acheter un nouveau dhb aeron race .
2	un élément important aussi est_la gratuité de_l ' expédition .
2	en ce_qui concerne le service , je_n ' ai que des compliments à adresser à_l ' équipe pour_la rapidité_de_l ' envoi . merci , félicitations , et bonne continuation !
2	voici un site vraiment très clair .
2	je cherchais des pneus et une mini pompe efficace .
2	la description des_produits avec leurs qualités , leur vocation et leur poids précis m ' a permis de comparer réellement entre les différents choix proposés .
2	pas comme sur certains sites où tous_les pneus sont soi - disant aussi performants les uns que_les autres .
2	en outre j ' ai_trouvé des chambres à air parfaitement adaptées à_mes pneus ( très rare ) ce_qui facilite le montage . emballage soigné , matériel bien rangé , je_suis sensible à_ce détail ;
2	enfin , les autres atouts pour_moi qui commande de belgique : le paiement par paypal et_la_livraison gratuite par mondial relay .
2	que du positif ! c ' est ma première_commande_chez cycles tyres , je garde l ' adresse au chaud pour plus_tard .
2	un_grand merci !

2	i sold my i pod touch through gadget_panda .
2	i was amazed_at how simple it was .
2	this panda kept me informed by e_mail all through the process , and before i knew it my money was in the bank .
2	a more generous price compared to other similar_companies .
2	thank_you panda , i hope to meet up again .
2	i always use partyrama if i want some fun products for events which i know will arrive quickly .
2	a great variety of quirky products .
2	i have had a horrendous_experience with talktalk !
2	there is no customer service - and if you decide to ' escalate your complaint to the ceo '_s office ' - the manner of the manager who eventually telephones you , beggars_belief !
2	i took out a telephone , broadband and tv contract .
2	the engineer came out on the friday to install the line .
2	no one had mentioned to me that i would not get my broadband until the following_monday until i tried to contact them , and got an_automated_message giving me the bad_news .
2	and try as i might to make contact with a human_being , i failed woefully , as each time i quoted my new number upon request , i was told to wait_until monday !
2	once the broadband was up and running the speed fluctuated below what was promised and stopped continuously .
2	a call_centre manager confirmed this , and although he raised the speed for me , within the conversation time with him , it fell again .
2	i had been promised the speed wouldn_'_t fall below 0 mb , but it did .
2	and i begun to wonder_why i had allowed myselkf to be lured by talktalk adverts to change providers .
2	after nothing improved by end of second week i said i wanted to ' escalate my complaint '.
2	an engineer was booked to come out , to check for problems - and to install my youview_box because the fact that i hadn_'_t connected it i was told was one of my problems with speed .
2	(?!
2	) something to do with an ' automated manager ' that took over until the connection .
2	( i hadn_'_t installed my youview_box because i '_m of the older_generation , not a techi in any way , and i was waiting for my daugther to do the honours !)
2	the engineer did not arrive on the date arranged .
2	an_hour and a half later i got a phone_call from the subcontracting company saying he had been sent by talktalk to an address in carlisle !
2	a second engineer was booked for the following_day and when he arrived he had not been told what he had to do apart_from ' service tv ' - and he showed me that information that he '_d been sent on his gadget .
2	when i said there was nothing wrong with my tv but he needed to check the broadband_speed and install my youview_box he refused the latter point_blank .
2	he said talktalk always did this and he hadn_'_t been given this instruction so he wasn_'_t doing it .
2	( remember i had been told by a manager that installing the box would inprove my speed , so the engineer would do it !)
2	try as i might to contact a manager , while the engineer was there failed , with various excuses .
2	the engineer left doing nothing and i decided to cancel my contract .
2	i have left out the details of so many unsatisfactory , unhelpful calls to call_centres abroad and in the uk , and several letters with no adequate responses .
2	the bottom line is talktalk staff don_'_t give a %!!
2	*&+@ about their customers , or their company '_s reputation .
2	they believe they ' re big enough to ride the storms .
2	they can put it down in an advert , but they ' re not interested enough to listen when something_goes_wrong , and to honestly endeavour to sort it out .
2	i knew i could be liable for early cancellation_fees but my experience to date had so sincerely stressed me , not getting through to anyone who seemed to be able to at_least appear to know what needed doing as a next step , and to do it .
2	the ombudsman '_s service took up my case but unfortunately , talktalk were able to refer to the small_print of the contract , refuting several facts that i know occurred , but they denied .
2	a derisory £_00 was knocked_off my total bill , with a letter of apology that '_s supposed to be on the way .
2	i '_m having to pay £_000 for deciding to put an end to the misery i was experiencing with talktalk , when there was zero prospect of things improving , and my sanity was at stake !
2	be warned !
2	if you dare take out a contract with talktalk and there are any_problems - you are on a one way ticket to stressville , and talktalk won_'_t give a jot .
2	i wouldn_'_t wish my experience on anyone .
2	i realise things go_wrong .
2	that '_s not the issue .
2	the issue is somone having the willingness , authority and sense of responsibility to constructively work with the customer to sort the problem out .
2	.
2	we are thrilled to bits with our recent_purchase of an oxford table and 0 albany chairs .
2	it was delivered as promised , well_packed and exactly as it looked on the website .
2	although there was a small split in the side seam of the back of one of the chairs it was swiftly replaced so we are highly delighted with the service and would not_hesitate to purchase again .
2	when ever i order from this company , it is so easy and i always receive my purchases very quickly .
2	prices are good too !!!
2	highly_recommended .
2	would highly_recommend viovet , easy ordering , fast delivery and also kept me well informed at each_stage of delivery by email .

2	would highly_recommend .
2	i bought this juicer having been recommended it by a good friend .
2	my previous juicer was a pain to wash and really because of this i didn_'_t use it much .
2	my new sena juicer from juicers uk is just awesome .
2	i can have my vegetables all juiced , the machine washed and back together within 00_minutes .
2	it '_s just amazing .
2	i would recommend it to anyone .
2	it '_s a must have .
2	i recently placed an on line order for a king_size duck feather 00tog duvet and a purple fleece throw great sale items .
2	both items were easy to order using the on line system .
2	within a couple of days a courier arrived with both parcels to be signed for .

2	it added to my delight that my order was free delivery .
2	the duvet and throw are of 000_% quality .

2	i booked three parcels , and needed help , i contacted a chat advisor named stephen williams , he was soooo helpful , and pleasant and kind
2	he really did sort everything out for me , and i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend parcel0go to anyone
2	they are the best
2	easy , quick transaction .
2	it '_s what you want when purchasing tickets .
2	just wanted to let you know that my new lakeland shower_enclosure and lovely shower are now installed .
2	i am extremely pleased with both and wanted to let you know how helpful i found stuart at prestige bathrooms who was able to answers all my questions prior to purchase .
2	the service i received was very prompt and second to none .
2	i will be more than happy to recommend prestige bathrooms to friends and family in the future .
2	i ordered a shower_rail which unfortunately was out of stock .
2	i was advised immediately and notified that i could have a full_refund if i did not want to wait .
2	i waited a week and then requested a refund as i had found the product elsewhere and was refunded immediately .
2	what more can you ask for other than someone keeping you informed and doing what they said they would straight_away .
2	thank_you !!!
2	!
2	fast delivery , good value and excellent quality , what more could you want ??
2	?
2	i recommend using pet_supermarket as i ordered a kong brush for our german_shepherds as normal brushes were irritating their skin .
2	the site is easy to use , the product arrive promptly and did exactly_what it said it would .
2	many_thanks from all of us , especially the dogs !
2	this was such an easy way to order beautiful flowers quickly and at great value too .
2	thanks iflorist !
2	sky_park steve booking was easy to use and very straightforward .
2	however , received an_email afterwards offering a further 0 %_discount if i revisited the site when i had already made my booking which was a bit rough !
2	thanks maximuscle .
2	bargain , easy to order and very very prompt delivery .
2	couldn_'_t be_faulted .
2	i had initially ordered from a larger internet supplier but i not only received the wrong product , i also received the wrong quantity .
2	they took a long time to despatch a replacement with no notification of how long it would take ..... and it has never arrived .
2	so i trawled the internet again and found pharmacyfix and i am so glad i did .
2	excellent service - very prompt despatch and great communication .
2	i will definitely use them again .
2	great customer service , fast delivery , user_friendly web_site , competitive_prices .
2	everything you could ask for .
2	thanks gjw_titmuss
2	jeg_fik hurtig respons og kvalificeret svar_på mine e_-_mails og telefonopkald .
2	mit epoxyprodukt fungerer efter hensigten og svarede til mine forventninger .
2	så alt i alt et super godt sted at handle .
2	bestilte sokkerne søndag og tirsdag var de i postkassen .
2	god information undervejs .
2	så_det_er nemt_og helt_klart anbefales værdigt , når_man nu ikke lige kan besøge deres butikker .
2	do not buy anything at infurn .
2	very bad customer service .
2	no responding to e_-_mails asking for the parcels arrivel and explanations for delaying things .
2	it is incredible that they are cheating on you .
2	it is fake .
2	big waste of money and no respect for other people .
2	i carn ´_t recommend them at all .
2	this was first time i ordered from active_beauty , but it was the best price on the internet , so i gave it a go .
2	no_regrets at all .
2	the item was well_packed and delivered really quickly .
2	so i am well pleased with the service .
2	price was best available .
2	communication excellent .
2	delivery in 0_days of perfect product .
2	what '_s not to like ?
2	!
2	bought loads over the years both directly from them and from their subscribers .
2	can_honestly_say i have never had a problem , or been less_than pleased with my purchase
2	excellent price - others advertised at this price , but didn_'_t have stock .
2	saveonlaptops delivered in 0_days .
2	well_packed and great laptop .
2	will recommend .
2	they don_'_t tell you that what you see as charges are for a ' pre_- order ' and when they finally get around to telling you what it will cost , and it shows for t - mobile £_00 . 00 - but when several days_later ( major delay ) they come_back they want another payment of £_00 !
2	this is exorbitant - compared to [_link ], which charges £_00 , or any high_street firm .
2	if you try to contact them by phone they leave you hanging ( twice more than 00_minutes , with no answer either time ) and you are paying charges for the phone_call ... they keep_repeating ' we value your call ' and i bet they really do - they ' re earning_money on it !
2	lots of choices with very reasonable_prices and the delivery is very fast .
2	will definitely recommend to friends and will also order for myself again ,
2	i have ordered from suuplement warehouse for a few_years_now .
2	they have the quickest processing and shipping of any mail order company i have ever used .
2	i have gotten my supplements the next_day a few_times without paying anything extra .
2	have had no_problems or complaints .
2	my husband ordered a bouquet of flowers as a birthday surprise and indeed it was a surprise but not a good one !
2	as the date he requested for delivery fell on a bank_holiday , prestige_flowers in their wisdom decided to deliver 0_days early without even checking that this was ok . well , it wasn_'_t as we were away on the day the company decided to deliver and so the flowers had to be taken to the local royal_mail delivery office where they had to stay for 0_days because of the bank_holiday and the limited opening_hours of our local office .
2	needless to say , by the time i collected them they were all dead .
2	on contacting the company , my husband was told that it was in their small_print that flowers could be delivered on an_alternative date if the company so decided and that a refund was out of the question .
2	shocking service to say the least but judging_by other comments on this site , prestige_flowers won_'_t be the slightest bit bothered that they spoilt my birthday surprise .
2	thank_you for dispatching my order so quickly .
2	i was so pleased to find your site , because i had been into so many places trying to buy long thin envelopes to use with the photo_calendars i had made for christmas_presents .
2	you have saved me , thank_you .
2	i received my headphones , the day after i placed my order , very impressive !
2	they are comfortable to wear and the case is convenient for carrying .
2	i was a little disappointed that i could still hear the car radio , when i was trying to listen to an audio book .
2	this was the main_reason for buying them .
2	also if using them with sky go on my ipad the sound goes out of sync , in fact distorted if you with the noise reduction mode !
2	products always of top quality .
2	have always received my orders promptly .
2	have been buying from woolovers for years since i discovered them at the west midland show !!
2	!
2	great site , easy to use and best on price by far , had looked at trivia go and last_minute . com , and this site was by the the best value for money , easy to use , contained all the information you required including honest_reviews , will definitely be using this again ... for our cheeky weekends away without the kids !
2	!
2	from_start to finish they were courteous , professional and great value for money , there '_s a saying buy cheap buy twice , i would thoroughly_recommend " metric " to anyone without_hesitation great job well_done .
2	dropped_off our after calling them 00_mins before our arrival waited ten_minutes and they were there took our car from us , and then we did the same on pick_up calling them when we arrived and again when we had claimed our baggage .
2	great service reliable , polite and competitively_priced .
2	just wanted to say a big thank_you for my beautiful furniture , i am so pleased with the 0 pieces of oxford furniture that i ordered .
2	from_start to finish i commend your service , and the items were really well_packed .
2	when buying from the internet , as you cannot view the items , i was apprehensive that some pieces would be less_than perfect .
2	having thoroughly inspect each item , i am pleased to say that this is not the case .
2	thank_you again , i will be checking out your web_site and have it book marked .
2	many_thanks again .
2	i chose digitalrev because they offered free delivery within a few_days of purchase which was essential as i was going away shortly_after and wanted to take the product with me .
2	the only other supplier that could match the sale price couldn_'_t arrange free delivery within this time_span .
2	delivery was on ( purchase day + 0 ) and the parcel was well_wrapped with layers of protective materials to prevent_damage .
2	all - in - all , a job very well_done .
2	my car needed an oil change and with in 0mins i had book and paid for one at a convenient time for me .
2	this was my first order .
2	the item arrived within two_days which is very impressive for free delivery .
2	it was exactly as_described and good quality .
2	i would certainly recommend ecigandliquid and will be ordering again .
2	i placed an order and all looked good .
2	it did not arrive and rather_than rectify the situation themselves when i complained i was given a tracking_number for my parcel .
2	the tracking page was incomprehensible and all i could i make out was that a notice of attempted delivery had been put through my door and the parcel no_longer needed to be signed for .
2	the parcel itself would have easily fitted through the letterbox and nothing was ever received .
2	i contacted wally '_s gifts again and matthew ( the only name i have been provided with ) offered a replacement item and refund .
2	when this did not happen paypal were blamed for the lack of a refund and there has_been no explanation why the new item has not arrived .
2	this has_been a truly miserable and unsatisfying experience .
2	do not order from wally '_s gifts if you expect to get the item you paid for .
2	i would not_hesitate to recomend this company from_start to finish you could not have asked for more .
2	very helpful and knowledgeable about their furniture and the delivery was very good emailed and phoned to let_me know what time to expect them .
2	after unpacking everything i was pleased with the quality of the furniture .
2	i would recomend this company
2	i nearly didn_'_t use this company due to the bad_reviews i read on this site , ordered perfume on saturday , chose second class_post , items arrived thursday .
2	thats what i call service .
2	i would not_hesitate to recomment this company to anyone .
2	i received my money within a few_days however , my friend sent her mobile to another company and is still_waiting to hear from them .
2	...........
2	my order was unfortunately delayed because of royal_mail problems , travelex telephoned me in case it would impact my holiday and then followed up afterwards to make_sure all was well .
2	excellent and the best rates .
2	use this company
2	good price and helpful staff however delivery was supposed to be on 0 / 0 and for some reason was arranged on 0 / 0 .
2	unfortunately it snowed over the weekend and the person we had arranged to sit could therefore not get here resulting in my husband having to take 0 hours off work .
2	have used castlegate_lights for all my new lighting .
2	i found that they have a good selection of good quality products and , best of all they have always been most helpful
2	when i have needed advice .
2	i cannot_fault them and would not_hesitate in using them again .
2	i find this site useful and i trust it which is the most_important_thing for me .
2	i look at it most days to keep_up with the deals for super_markets etc and i like the utility comparison site too .
2	i would recommend this site to anyone .
2	had what i wanted , i ordered and the items arrived quickly with no_problems .
2	fantastic service fantastic choice of good quality shoes
2	and i will be ordering again without_hesitation
2	great deals and great value .
2	just what i need .
2	have used reptile_centre for years with no_problems .
2	deliverer every thing on time .
2	very good price and very quick .
2	i am most pleased with the service i '_ve had from viovet .
2	they offer good value and excellent packaging and delivery , which i '_ve always received by the next_day .
2	after ordering on thursday before mothers_day my mum still has not recieved her bouqet six days on !
2	after trying all day to get_hold of someone finally they refused to help saying they couldnt offer a refund and if the flowers still didnt turn_up they would resend them .
2	i paid_extra for a sunday delivery also .
2	i wanted to talk to a supervisor and was told no one else could help mke after sending emails i still have not had an_apology or refund or any flowers
2	i wouldnt even give them half a star !
2	poor_excuse for a company !
2	have now recieved an_email from some rep called jamie after a week of getting no where .
2	prestige_flowers have blamed royal_mail but still cant tell me where my flowers are . was advised they could send another bouquet and a £ 0 . 00 voucher fpr next time !
2	pah next time !
2	i have been advised by trading standads that as they have breached their contract to deliver the said flowers on the said day i should write and request a full_refund .
2	i have emailed them to inform them but surprise_surprise heard_nothing again from them .
2	i have also contacted_watchdog and explained the situation > please report them if you are disappointed with the service , so we can stop another family_members day being ruined !!
2	!
2	i have ordered loads of things from argos online this last few_months .
2	the prices are great and the delivery is always very prompt .
2	i will_continue to shop both online and via reserve for collection .
2	i have been using littlewoods for a number of years_now , delivery is always propmt , often arriving well before the latest date advertised .
2	the delivery men are always happy and obliging .
2	the buy now and pay in 00 months is a really superb way of spreading the cost especailly coming up to christmas .
2	i am a returning_customer purchasing glasses for my husband . the service is always spot_on and they are delivered extremely quickly . why pay stupid money on the high_street where you are pounced on straight_away and hurried into choosing a style ? i can relax in my own_home and my husband can take his time deciding what style and at a fraction of the cost . thank_you for your quality customer service !
2	service efficient , driver very friendly .
2	got us to our hotel faster and we even had time for breakfast before being picked_up from the hotel . would definately recommend . worth that little extra for a private_transfer !!
2	!
2	click transfers sent me an_email to welcome me home . they said that if for any reason my review wasn_'_t positive , then i should email them direct . they said " we are big fans of loyalty and as a sign of our appreciation for 0_* reviewing our services you will receive a 00_%_discount offer on your next transfer with us !
2	simply send a link to your review when its online to reviews @ clicktransfers . com and we will send you a unique code . i did this and i never received any such thing . i then emailed customer_services and surprise_surprise i still didn_'_t even receive a response . thinking_about it , i never got the discount_code the last time i reviewed them . so much for being big fans of loyalty . more like bribery to me . i wont_be using them again !!!!!
2	!
2	update . the reason_why i didn_'_t get a reply was because i mis spelt the company name when composing my emails . so please disregard my negative_comments re : clicktransfers . i apologise for my carelessness !!!
2	!
2	i have used quidco on many occasions and have always had good experiences . whether its for 00p cashback or £_00 cashback , it all mounts_up . if you need advice , their communication is excellent . i would recommend quidco to anyone .
2	i purchased my elonix touch screen tablet from zavvi , which offered free delivery with this item . i expected it to take longer because of this , but no , i ordered it in a sunday_night and it arrived on tuesday_morning . very good service , recommended and i would not_hesitate to shop from zavvi again .
2	initial problem with website meant two orders went through by mistake .
2	staff were really helpful the following_morning and problem was sorted_out .
2	arrived quickly and in good condition .
2	i '_m delighted with my purchase .
2	it took three tries for them to send the correct order , each time with long delays .
2	slow to respond to email and no phone number .
2	took two full months from placing the order to getting it sorted_out - unacceptable by any standards .
2	i have a cocker_spaniel who has developed an itch with fipronil spot - on so i am going to give billy no mates a try .
2	i mix it in with his morning porridge / dried_dog_food - yoghurt would do just as well , my dog has the skin and saucepan scrapings from my breakfast :-) - and he_eats it with no problem .
2	i will review again to say whether billy no mates has worked .
2	the star_rating is because my dog eats it .
2	the tub arrived in good time with no damage .

2	i ordered the jacket at the height of the christmas_period , when deliveries were being delayed_due to heavy_snow , and still received it within two_days of ordering it .

2	first_class service strongly_recommend
2	having been with this site for couple of years , when making a sale ( which is few and far between i might_add ), i am constantly informed after making a sale that the quality of the image is not good enough !
2	continually told to re - photograph the images is impossible as any of the works i have on the site are either sold or have been discarded due to damage .
2	i was a premium member but i am now in a quandary as the artwork is still not good enough even_though i have limited sizes available for buyers as i am useless with fauxtography .
2	blurry , lighting , half cropped signatures are always the problem + i hate making sales when i know that i will get an_email_stating the image is pixelated , blah_blah_blah !
2	i realise it is up to the seller to check images at 000_% but it would be good to have someone check the upload , someone_who_knows what they are doing , advise the artist to amend this and that before a sale is made !
2	as an artist , i am constantly attempting to make the images larger , only to be told they are still not " good quality ".
2	a cancellation recently occurred and i was gutted again .
2	i am not a photographer , have no idea about cameras and yet now i have to await my son in laws visit to see if he can do the job that faa needs to get a " quality " photograph that will be up to scratch , and then maybe i will become a premium member once again .. we will see !
2	as an oil painter i have frequented many greeting_card sites on the internet and have to say i have had some success in making my work available for greetings_cards , but for some reason after trying many sites that are supposedly brilliant , my experiences with them left me cold .
2	the prices were off the scale considering i was purchasing my own work as samples , so not only was i uploading my work , at one site my work was either taking up to a month to be passed or i was told " not good enough " and sent back to amend more often than not , the quality was rubbish .
2	in the end i was flogging a dead horse , because no matter_how hard i tried i was getting_nowhere fast and it was soul_destroying for me as an artist and a human_being .
2	i left those sites due to difference of opinions and am now trying to make zazzle work for me instead of the other way round !
2	i uploaded a particular image of a winter scene for christmas cards , and decided to take a chance and order 00 as the picture was really very pretty in sepia .
2	they have arrived and i have to say they are beautiful and although dark i love them and will be proud to send them out to family and friends this year .
2	thankyou zazzle so much for quality , affordability and the honour of being a member here .
2	best regards

2	exactly as advertised and quick delivery
2	my husband and i used supplement_warehouse for a few_years , then switched to another sight that offered free shipping with memebership .
2	it sounded_like a good deal , $_00 a month , free shipping and every_month we would get a box of " samples " to try .
2	what a huge mistake .
2	number one we realized we order about every 0 - 00 weeks .
2	number two the samples were for products we would never use , and pretty_much the same every_month , with only one or two new items .
2	( sw offers almost all of these free with orders plus amazing closeout deals ).
2	number three i had to sign a 0 month agreement ($ 00 ), their products were about 00_% higher then sw .
2	so honesly , the cost i pay for shipping and the lower prices are really the best deal , and if you do find a product listed lower sw will beat that too .
2	they really are the best company out there , we are back now and wont_be going anywhere_else again !
2	order arrived perfectly within a couple of days
2	ordered a trumpet for my son late on a thursday_evening and it arrived in perfect_condition on monday_morning .
2	i was kept_updated by email of order and delivery status throughout the process .
2	excellent value for money
2	i found the staff at dunelm extremely efficient and eager to assist me in my order , they were abreath of fresh_air to deal with and i would have no_hesitation in shopping in dunelm or online again ... a +
2	i found working with mazuma moble a very professional and easy process , they basicially did all the hard_work for me .

2	brilliant would definitely use mazuma again .

2	the repair on my son '_s almost new ipad_mini was perfect and restored it to a good as new condition .
2	this was my first visit to the guys at mendmyi but no_doubt with two clumsy teenagers in the house this won_'_t be my last !
2	!
2	after trying unsuccessfully for two_days to send flowers to my sister , i decided to try arena flowers out of sheer desperation .
2	it was the easiest order i have ever been able to place .
2	my package arrived on time and my sister was so surprised by the way it was arranged and she , s also very happy with the contents .
2	i , m_glad i did not get through to the other_places i tried .

2	service is excellent delivery straight_away
2	this watch is of a superb design and quality a must buy for any lady_who_wants to feel special .
2	chose you because your telephone_operators were knowledgeable , courteous and quick .
2	we had also read_reviews on your website .
2	we found cheaper quotes too but price isn_'_t everything .
2	the telephone service we received was second to none which is a welcome_change in these times .
2	if we ever make a claim we hope we receive the same admirable service .
2	time will tell .
2	this is the one .
2	very pleased .
2	from placing the order on line to delivery we received a first_class service .

2	kept constantly in touch with delivery progress via_email .
2	i have been using arenaflowers . com for a number of years to send flowers and gifts to my relatives in england .
2	i used to have to get up in the middle of the night to call a florist ( due to the time change ).
2	now i get email reminders about birthdays and anniversaries a week ahead , i no_longer have to set my alarm and lose sleep or pay huge postal fees for shipping gift parcels or worry_about postal strikes in either country !
2	i have yet to be disappointed , and even better , i look like a rock star niece for being on time ( not something i am best known for ).
2	plus i often hear from my auntie that the bouquets we send are so big that she breaks them into several groups and decorates the whole house .
2	i can say that this is by far the best on - line shopping system , and best floral delivery i have ever_encountered in canada or elsewhere .
2	thanks .
2	from order to delivery in three_days and we were able to track it around the globe .
2	it arrived at ema at 0000 and was at our house in derby next_morning .
2	thank_you we are so pleased with our purchase .
2	two parcels collected at 0000 and both delivered by midday next_day to separate parts of the country .
2	well_done and affordable too .
2	important for a charity !
2	although the phone was not the replacement phone was not the one i signed_up to they refused to remedy the situation but said i would have to pay a cancellation_fee if i wished to end the contract .
2	staff were quite happy to leave me as an unsatisfied customer tied_into a contract which was not that i signed_up to .
2	ordered cycling_gloves on a thursday and they arrived friday_morning by recorded delivery .
2	even better they were reduced from 00 . 00 to 00 . 00 with free_postage .
2	i wanted to find a dog shirt that said ' i love my grandma and grandpa ' and this one is perfect .
2	it is light - weight and comfortable for my chiweenie , which makes me very satisfied with this purchase .

2	first time user , will definitely use again
2	i am very impressed with the service from this company - it was swift and efficient , i was kept_informed at all_stages of the order and the toy arrived exactly on time .
2	it was even one of the cheapest for the toy i needed !
2	i would definitely use them again and would recommend them to family and friends .
2	the staff_member i spoke to was [_name_] and she was so polite , helpful and a credit to your company .
2	the service & delivery was exellent , delivered promptly , well_packed .
2	i love the item
2	animed always offer great prices for the specialist_cat_food i need , and the delivery time is so quick which is why i use them regularly .
2	the booking process was very simple and the price was very reasonable .
2	would use again .
2	so impressed with the quality of my canvases , will be proud to show them .
2	great quality , speedy service .
2	added_bonus , it was bogof !
2	this site offers me original cartridges at great prices .
2	they also ship fast , highly_recommended
2	it '_s easy to navigate the site & order the products .
2	you can easily download private prescriptions , no need to post originals .
2	what is really good is that you can schedule repeat_orders .
2	couldn_'_t be simpler
2	like the info available about sources for things like the fish_oil tablets .
2	ordered online , collected 0_days_later .
2	no queues .
2	good rate of exchange
2	posted my phones late one evening , money in my bank the next_day .
2	incredible .
2	the service and products that butik00 offers is second to none !
2	the quality of the stockings is excellent compared to uk prescription stockings that i have been given and they work out cheaper too .
2	i have even recommended the company to the staff at the nhs clinic i attend .
2	apparently , patients are always on the lookout for a better quality stocking than those on offer here in the uk .
2	very good price offered , not the best but close , then the transaction was prompt and
2	exactly as advertised .
2	would use them again .
2	i totally agree about stoneacre putting lives at risk .
2	bought a car for my daughter to travel to university , car was four years old and cost £ 0 , 000 in september .
2	broke_down the first day she used it .
2	the car went to the citroen garage for a week , we were assured it was fixed .
2	as you can_imagine , my daughter had little confidence to now drive all the way to cambridge .
2	in december , car broke_down again , and was stuck on town bridge for three hours .
2	again the car was in the garage for a week and assured once again it was working fine .
2	i demanded our money back , but stoneacre said it was their policy to try and fix it first .
2	it broke_down again yesterday .
2	this is the third time .
2	i will be surprised if she has driven more than 000_miles since the day we got the car .
2	no one seems to now what is wrong with it .
2	this time i am demanding my money back and compensation .
2	we had only hear bad_reviews about stoneacre but it was the only place that sold a car my daughter wanted .
2	the salesman reassured us that he had been head hunted to improve the companies reputation .
2	this clearly hasn_'_t worked .
2	i would advise anyone reading this , to think_twice before buying from this company .
2	i am very impressed with the service provided !
2	the washing_machine i ordered arrived on the day , within the delivery time - slot - we were given 00_minutes ' warning before the van arrived , and the installation was very quick and efficient .
2	i would definitely recommend the website for the brilliant service we got !
2	the mchine itself is great , and the delivery time was excellent .
2	00 / 00 and thanks !
2	the service from this company is brilliant .
2	the goods arrived very quickly and was packaged well , so no damage to product .
2	the quality of the product is wonderful and does exactly as the company said it would .
2	there was no variation from the goods ordered to the goods i received .
2	cheapest prices but no way was the service cheapest .
2	great value for the money .
2	since_starting my family tree , i have found many different_angles of my family .
2	some good , some bad but most of all , i have found more living relatives .
2	the goods arrived swiftly and in excellent condition .
2	the packaging was of good quality so goods were protected in transit .
2	the goods were exactly as_described and all packages were sealed with a re - sealable zip style fastening ( no drying out or spill ).
2	i wanted a joint_supplement for my horse betty who is bad on her hocks , a friend of mine recommended aviforn suppleze_gold , i bought some and it was £_00 and i cannot tell you how brilliant its been , i have had to load dose her for a couple of weeks as she was really only standing on 0 legs but today i lunged her and cant tell you how much_better she is now .
2	she was compltelty sound today and we even cantered on the lunge which she has never been able to do .
2	if you have a horse with aches & pains its really worth a try !
2	i '_ve been using ecw for many_years_now and i always get the very best value for my money !
2	having paid for next_day delivery i was very disappointed that it turned_up three_days late !
2	i won_'_t be rushing to buy from blackleaf again .
2	i prefer using quality products that you can usually only buy in beauty or hair salons .
2	hq_hair is an easy to navigate site with many of the products i want to use available .
2	prices are better_than i can buy locally and delivery on the free service arrives within a few_days .
2	really pleased with the service .
2	really friendly delivery man .
2	who delivered our trampoline which i have to say weighed 00 . 00kg and because of this it should have been a two man job .
2	i tried to help him bring it to the front_door .
2	and i could not even lift it .
2	just like to say with items that weigh that much really need two man to do the job .
2	but other than that i would be more than happy to use this company again and recommend to any one .
2	big thanks to the delivery driver !!
2	!
2	i have bought my son a washing_machine at a great price also they plumbed it in for him which was great there is a charge for this but well_worth it and peace of mind_knowing that its been done right really pleased .
2	thank_you ao .
2	com
2	i have nothing but praise for canvasdezign .
2	the product i have just received is superb and i would use them again without_hesitation .
2	but it is their customer service which is second to none .
2	having made a mistake in the size of picture i ordered i rang to change it .
2	the print that was delivered was the original size , but when i conyacted them cd made a new print in the correct_size and delivered it within four days without hesitaion .
2	this is unbeatable !!
2	very strongly recommended .
2	had my pc from dino for 0_weeks now and am delighted .
2	it is very quiet , fast and because i was able to select my operating_system ( windows 0 ) i have not been plagued with the vagaries of windows 0 .
2	my son bought a pc from dino 0_months_ago and he is similarly delighted , so our family track record is 000_%!
2	worth having a chat with them before you buy because they will give you good advice on what to spend your money on and what not to - they do actually build your machine to order , so it does take about 00 days to come .
2	i would recommend dino without_any reservation whatsoever .
2	checked with sales_staff that the phone i wanted was in , filled in online application and received it the following_morning .
2	far better deal than 0 were offering £ 0 . 00_pm cheaper on a straight monthly_contract with no vouchers to send in and no free gift .
2	a real 0_star service and i will use them again .
2	norton_000 v0 as desctibed new sealed authentic .
2	arrived very quickly , good communication
2	item cheaper_than elsewhere and arrived very quickly in perfect_condition .
2	very easy website to follow to find the correct ram needed for my computer .
2	beat_competitors on price .
2	received product the very next_day !
2	would definitely use again !
2	great website , very quick delivery , very happy customer !
2	so easy to spend too much money and time here !
2	i have to be very careful , as there is so much to choose from !
2	enjoy the product , the quips and making hats for their charity work with sainsbury '_s
2	am really pleased with the service i '_ve had from deramores !
2	i usually go to amazon before i look anywhere_else nowadays , be it for a pressure_washer , bird_food or books .
2	as i can also earn nectar_points i '_m really pleased !
2	i particularly_like secrets of the phoenix as its not available on other_sites .
2	however , at times i have to turn chat off - the hosts are very variable .
2	some allow blatantly sexual banter while one female host in particular drags people off chat for the slightest reason , particularly where she does not agree with their jokes !
2	when k is on duty i switch off chat and just concentrate on the games !
2	winnings are up and down but i withdrew £_000 this weekend :)
2	website very user_friendly .
2	easy to reo - order and goods always delivered on time .
2	wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend them
2	i wanted flowers for a birthday_celebration for a friend in malta .
2	i chose floraqueen .
2	the web_page showed a beautiful range of flowers to choose from and was easy to use .
2	the flowers were delivered as requested and were beautiful our friend was absolutely_delighted .
2	the communcation from floraqueen was prompt and courteous .
2	i would recommend them to anyone .
2	c t calder
2	products always arrive very quickly and well_packaged
2	their products are first_rate , the yumega_plus has helped our french_bulldog immensely with her itchy_skin and thanks to their newsletter have found out that she suffers from harvest mites .
2	both hers and the staffies coats are incredibly soft now .
2	their service is excellent .
2	i wonder what checks wowcher undertake with their merchants to ensure that they are bonfida companies .
2	in september , using a wowcher , we bought a 0 " tablet from <_external link_removed >.
2	after many emails and calls to <_external link_removed >,.
2	the item arrived nine weeks_later .
2	on receipt it was wrapped up and hidden way until christmas .
2	on christmas day the item didn_'_t appear to work properly - kept on freezing , couldn_'_t hold a battery charge , wouldn_'_t recognise internet_connection .
2	however , we persevered , but to no_avail - the tablet no_longer works and continually freezes .
2	in these circumstances the sale of goods_act is clear , the item is not fit for the purpose - return to seller for a refund .
2	oh that we could .
2	it seems that <_external link_removed_> no_longer has a web presence / phone number / customer service / returns address .
2	sadly , from our experience and those of many others who have posted on the www , it seems that <_external link_removed_> was a scam .
2	they appear to have been knowingly selling faulty , chinese made tablets and promoting the fraud by using wowcher to validate their products by promoting a discount_voucher .
2	.
2	wowcher '_s involvement in <_external link_removed >' fraud is unclear .
2	the promotion of <_external link_removed_> by wowcher implies that they endorsed the product / company .
2	after all they wouldn_'_t have ' vouchers ' for scam companies would they ?
2	it seems that any check that wowcher undertake with those whose services and products they are promoting is not sufficiently vigorous enough .
2	hopefully wowcher will be able to resolve this and instigate procedures which will prevent other_companies from using the to scam people .
2	in the mean time we would be grateful to know what action we can take in returning the tablet and receiving a refund .
2	although other phone buyers quoted slightly more for my phone i wasn_'_t entirely happy with the reviews that some of these companies were receiving .
2	so i decided to sell to mazumamobile .
2	this turned_out ot be an excellent decison .
2	the whole_transaction was simple and i received my cheque the day after they received the phone .
2	i would recommend this company to anyone_wishing to sell their phone .
2	i contacted ace -_fx about buying my euros from me after a cancelled holiday , as the buy back rate is appalling at travel_agents ...... i was a little_worried sending almost £ 0 , 000 in euros through the post via special delivery , for ace -_fx to change back to sterling , but michael & jack were really reassuring and helpful and put me at ease , and within 0 hour of them receiving the euros , the sterling equivelent was paid into my bank .
2	i cannot_praise this company enough .
2	highly_recommended and will_definately be using this company again , and recommending to friends .

2	i ordered from simply_electronics , before i read thse reviews , so was very anxious_about getting my goods .
2	after 0 - 0_days i began to regret ordering it , thinking i wouldnt receive it .
2	i had ordered from amazon , but the goods were coming from se , a great price of £_000 for a tamron lens that was £_000 elsewhere .
2	amazons delivery times were 0 - 00 day , and i am happy to say the lens arrived within that time .
2	they sent me a tracking_number 0_days before it was despatched , and i was able to track its_whereabouts til it arrived at my door .
2	so maybe i was lucky , but i am very pleased with the lens , and the service provided by se .
2	why did i not check that very use this company .
2	why am i always on the receiving end of their incompetent and lying drivers ?
2	yet again , i have been informed over the website that the driver attempted a delivery at 0 . 00 and left a card through the door .
2	which door ?
2	not my door .
2	seeing as i have been home since 0pm then plainly he has knocked_off early to go home and have his dinner .
2	it is a criminal offence to falsify documentation .
2	if the driver has done this , he should be sacked .
2	i have re - scheduled for wednesday but given he / she does know where i live ( he / she didn_'_t know where i lived earlier this year either as two garden chairs from tesco were apparently delivered to me and signed for , only naturally they were not - hope the delivery driver had nothing but misery out of sitting on my chairs all summer long ) then how on earth is my expensive electrical item going to get to me on wednesday ?
2	and yes , yodel , before you respond to this i have indeed just sent an_email to the address given so no need to respond to me via this website thank_you .
2	disgraceful company .
2	neil lloyd , ceo of this dreadful business , are you reading any of these reviews ?
2	if not , why not .
2	as a quick comparison over what we paid for three items of furniture to other stores , we got an_absolute_bargain .
2	beautifully made items which are solid and heavy and very well_constructed .
2	also arrived within five weeks of ordering and delivery men who phoned beforehand and arrived on time .
2	we will definitely be ordering a dining_room table .
2	we had so much_trouble trying to order furniture through another well - known firm for three_months - they could certainly take_note of the superb customer service offered here and quality of products
2	i was a pipex customer for years and had very little complaints about them .
2	since talk_talk took over i feel the quality of service has dropped dramatically - and it '_s only been a couple of weeks !
2	i asked for a simple change on my account ; i was on the phone for over an_hour , was passed around , told to ring 0 different numbers , and my query has still not been answered .
2	sorry talk_talk but you ' re not listening to me - i am very disappointed with your service .
2	i have been using healthspan for several_years_now and have never been disappointed with their service or quality .
2	their website is so easy to use , and i have just noticed that it has_become easier !
2	no_messing_around with putting your card_details in - it '_s there for you now .
2	excellent !
2	very helpful
2	very good value for money and excellent customer service .
2	my first order arrived very quickly after ordering on 0nd_january , but i wasn_'_t quite sure_whether it was the right size .
2	so i ordered the smaller_size too , only available in a different colour - this also arrived very quickly .
2	then decided that the smaller one was the right size but wrong_colour .
2	so , had to get an exchange and a refund - all achieved without_any hassle at all and the right sized jacket in the right colour arrived really promptly .
2	so now i '_m warm and cosy and every one is admiring my jacket .
2	i emailed webtogs asking about how to care for the down jacket as there is no label in it - i received a helpful email promptly .
2	i found webtogs quite by_chance when looking online for suppliers of rab jackets - keep_up the good work and will i '_m_sure be ordering more from you .
2	delivered when they said they would , received goods within 0_days of order .
2	went looking for ideas , found them here .
2	i will shop again .
2	good communications re delivery , thoroughly good experience .
2	outstanding service , arrived day after order .
2	my plumber cannot_believe the value and will shop himself from best heating .
2	can '_t rate this company highly_enough .
2	i needed new tyres , they came out to my work and sorted everything out for me .
2	gerat service , no_hassle , great prices , friendly staff - why go_anywhere_else ?
2	brilliant !
2	what more can i say ?
2	called to check on the tablets i needed , placed the order the same day , uploaded the prescription the next_day and the tablets arrived the day after .
2	saved me lots of money - got to be a good thing !
2	thank_you viovet !
2	when cooking it is important to get the best ingredients you can , and vanilla_mart supply them , their customer service is second to non and they always have your best_interests at heart , thank_you for the great service
2	if you love chocolate to eat or you love chocolate to cook with this is the place to get it , in my opinion it is the best chocolate you can get and the price is better_than i thought for this first_class product , thank_you , and it taste great to .
2	i am so pleased that i used this seller they are completely customer_focused , the item wasn_'_t bad either , no seriously they are great
2	having recieved another pacel delivered by yodel i must_say the service is excellent the communication is excellent email and texts_telling_me exactly where the parcel is from_start to finish well_done yodel
2	this is the first time i have had to sell a phone and it could not have been easy , and so quick will definitely use there service in the future ,,, well_done mazumma
2	we used service in gran_canaria .
2	we were extremely impressed and will definitely use again .
2	easy , good value service .
2	you guys keep_coming up with the goods .
2	fantastic action shots again this weekend and i love those new quads .
2	no surprise to see so many people queuing to buy photos - organisers would be mad not to book you up .
2	was recommended to use jet0 by our son who travels with them frequently and was not disappointed .
2	i would definitely recommend them for good customer service , good leg_room in normal seats ( and i have long legs ), comfortable journey and reasonably_priced refreshments .
2	this will be our benchmark for future flights .
2	well_done jet0 .
2	i don_'_t need to explain my case .
2	it resembles the reviews .
2	for the record :
2	i waited 0 full year for 0 designchairs , it has_been delayed 0 times , 0 times without giving notice , i called 00 times with 0 different people , haven_'_t been called back for 0 times , emailed over 00 times , waited for my refund for 0_months untill i mailed to stefanie mueller from infurn .
2	when you are having problems , contact stefanie mueller ( stefanie . mueller @ infurn . com ).
2	she can really help and keeps her word .
2	good luck .
2	brilliant service .
2	received the next_day , no problem with installation and now have a faster computer .
2	what could be easier .
2	did not have to take pc in for a techy to look at nor pay to have the work done !
2	highly_recommend .
2	i needed to get my elderly_mother a waterproof cast cover , i found one at a very good price from the complete_care shop , once i had placed my order it was dispatched very quickly , i found the customer service i received to be excellent , i would not_hesitate to recommend the complete_care shop to others and i would definitely buy from them again
2	we purchased the louie sleigh_bed in white ( kingsize ), it looked lovely on the website and it was such a good price !
2	so we went_ahead and ordered , i must_say that the customer service was excellent and the delivery charge was very reasonable , the bed came in very good time and the delivery men were very helpful .
2	the bed didn_'_t take too long to put up and it looked fantastic when assembled , and very sturdy .
2	we have had the bed for approx 0months and are still so pleased with it , its really lovely quality and my friends & family who have seen it are impressed especially when i tell them how much it cost .
2	i would definitely buy from this company again and have no_hesitation in recommending them to others .
2	we needed a new bed and after_spending a very restful night at a premier_inn i decided that i wanted to find out what mattresses they use and after_googling i found out that " hypnos " were the people that supplied their mattresses , after deciding which mattress i wanted i put this into my search_engine and found that the best price for this mattress was from a company called mattressman , and may i say that from ordering to the delivery i received excellent service , they were awaiting stock when i first ordered but i only had to wait a few_days until it was back in stock , and i was called up by a very pleasant customer adviser who arranged a time for delivery with me , when the delivery day came i was called to say that my mattress was en_route by the time i put my phone down the mattress had come , two very helpful delivery men also took it up to my room of choice !, i would definitely recommend this company to others and would definitrly buy from them again
2	my son leaves for oxford uni this weekend and left it till a few_days ago to inform_me he needed a tuxedo etc .. as he would be attending a freshers " black_tie event ", i was advised that as these events would occur on & off throughout his time there it is more cost_effective to buy instead of hiring .
2	i found my tuxedo through my search_engine and i am glad that i did , ordering was straightforward & easy , they offered very good packages at excellent prices , i chose the gold package which was fantastic value , dispatch & delivery were extra fast ( i chose to pay for guaranteed next_day delivery ) and received texts & emails_updating_me on my order status from_start to finish .
2	i was extremely impressed with the quality of my goods when they arrived and the fit of the jacket was great , i had to return the trousers as they were a little snug but i ordered another pair with the help of the customer service adviser which are due this morning , all in all i have no_hesitation in highly recommending this company , excellent customer service from_start to finish and top quality items at a very reasonable_prices .
2	on a sunday morning we like if possible to have something from the mcdonalds breakfast menu , this would always be the same things for my son & myself it is the egg & bacon bagel meal & my husband has a sausage & egg mcmuffin , an easy order wouldn_'_t you say , it seems not when it comes to our local mcdonalds the last 0 times yes 0 times my husband has_been to the restaurant he has come_back with egg & bacon mcmuffins despite telling the person serving exactly_what we wanted & asking them to make_sure & check ( & getting the look that would kill ) , as the parking is difficult ( main_road , parking restrictions everywhere ) my husband has to be as quick as possible so its only when he has got home and given us our orders that we have discovered yet again they have got it wrong even_though ( as i have mentioned earlier ) my husband insisted they checked the order , it may seem petty but if i went into a shop & asked for a bottle of milk i would not expect to get a bottle of lemonade , i actually hate mcmuffins so i was not best pleased on 0 occasions to have them instead of bagels !
2	we have not gone back to that mcdonalds since ( they are always messing up orders & are rude ) & when i complained to mcdonalds customer service all i got told was that the restaurant in question was a franchise & basically not their problem but they would pass on my comments & details & that i would hear back from the manager , well that was two_weeks_ago ....... still_waiting ....., well_done mcdonalds your customer service is non exsistant and i will not be " dinning " in any of your branches again .
2	i ordered a set of towels costing_£_00 from a well_known high_street store on september 0th , as i have ordered from this store before many_times i was not too worried that anything would go_wrong , yesterday it dawned on me that my order had not yet arrived so i went straight on to the stores site to check my order status and there in black & white it said 0 / 0 /_0000 time 00 . 00 customer signature !, well that is not at all possible as i was not even at home at that time as i would have been in work , i have called the store only to be told that i will have to wait 00_hours giving hermes time to respond or to see if they can find my parcel !
2	unbelievable find my parcel according to hermes " the customer " has signed for it , either way they are liars as no body was in when they claimed it was signed for & if they left it with a neighbour where is my card to say where my goods are , absolutely_dreadful service !
2	and i am now for the moment £_00 out of pocket !
2	great prices , a wide_variety of choice and excellent customer service , a one stop_shop for all your pets_needs , i would highly_recommend them
2	i had looked at lots of wallpaper on the usual diy sites then wallpaper_direct came up on my search_engine & straight_away i found the perfect paper , i liked the fact you could use the wallpaper estimator feature to work out how many rolls of paper you would need , i placed my order and received it within a couple of days !
2	it was as simple as that , i would definitely buy from wallpaper_direct again & have recommended it to my friends & family .
2	i stumbled on this site when i was looking for a chair for my son '_s computer_desk , & i am so glad that i did as i saw the turin leather faced manager chair , after_seeing the price ( £_00 . 00 inc_vat ) & reading all the positive_reviews i went_ahead & ordered , it arrived in the time_scale stated ( really fast ) was very easy to assemble , a fantastic quality chair at a very competitive price i would highly_recommend " office furniture online " to others & would definitely purchase from them again
2	great service , quick response via phone from the owner , seriously impressed with the professional and friendly service received ..... top drawer .
2	ordered two_pairs of boots , nearly 0_days_later got an mail to say that they weren_'_t in stock ......
2	ordered again the same .. nearly a week_later refunded on both_occasions . what is the point !
2	exceptionally dissappointed ....
2	wow such an amazingly quick and professional service , i really cannot recommend enough !
2	filled in the details online , and 00_hours_later the money was already in my account !
2	it '_s such a pleasure to deal with a company that prides_itself on customer service .
2	well_done mazuma .

2	the quality (£_00 . 00 frames ) is the same as specsavers and they don_'_t have the 000mm frames , except for some naff kiddy pairs .
2	i don_'_t want to look like joe 00 with frames sticking out the side of my head !
2	i ordered all four with reaction ( react to light ) lenses and paid about £_00 for each pair as i was on the two for 0 deal .
2	those reviews that say the frames are poor quality must be going for the £ 0 . 00 frames and if so , what do they expect ?
2	the glasses are made in pakistan and sent in bulk , i presume , to a uk agent who forwards them by royal_mail .
2	in my case they took a couple of days longer to arrive than specsavers quoted me and at 0 / 0 the price of specsavers ' own 0 for 0 deal .
2	don_'_t be frightened to order from this professional company with customer service as a top_priority - thanks goggles0u :-)
2	lovely lady spoke to me on the phone , my only_criticism is that i was promised a phone_call at 0 - 00 and it was actually 0 - 00 when i got the call .
2	i would recommend shipley for carriage of small furniture , they are much_cheaper_than larger carriers and provide just as good a service .
2	bought the penguin onesie fancy_dress outfit .
2	bought the medium which is actually quite big however that adds to authenticity as it really gives the penguin look .
2	this will be my fancy_dress when i '_m in santa '_s grotto later in the year .
2	fast delivery and a good price thank_you .
2	much_cheaper_than i can buy it anywhere_else and even if i suddenly realise i have forgotten to place the order the delivery is so quick that it really doesn_'_t matter .
2	well_packaged and easy to just re - order with the click of a button .
2	also you get a full history of your orders so you can see when and how much you paid .
2	since my first order , one month_ago , and subsequent returns , i have placed further orders because i trust the service and am very pleased with the range and choices .
2	product arrived when promised .
2	james , at watchfinder provided a superb service , the watch arrived on time , and as_described on the watchfinder site and by james .
2	the service was imformative , attentive , a rare but therefore , more valuable commodity , and above all accurate .
2	jade in despatch provided me with a update a regular_intervals as to when delivery would be made .
2	both members at watchfinder are a credit to the watch service industry .
2	i would have no_hesitation of recommending watchfinder to anyone looking for a genuine quality watch .

2	oh !
2	what a wonderful delight , to log on to this brilliant site .
2	when a holiday you seek , that '_s downloaded each week
2	with the pick of the best deals , which each one could appeal ,
2	the service you will receive , guarantees you '_ll not leave ,
2	so thanks dealchecker , please take a bow , because i '_m now all booked up and ready to go ,
2	from josie jones
2	i am very satisfied , very good deals , affordable_prices and very fast delivery , thank_you .
2	two months_ago closing a deal with forbrugerpost . dk ., but the money from the account they still pulls , please return the money as any product i have not received and do not want to receive .
2	did not receive the ordered product , as well as the money has not yet been returned , waiting for a month , very bad work of the company '_s employees ,
2	when what you buy doesnt work you expect a company to arrange a replacement - not these people - they cannot even be bothered to reply to emails .
2	there are plenty of better firms selling the same products
2	i love the low_prices with supplement_warehouse so much i added it to my favorites on my home page
2	i had previously heard negative_comments about yodel but i cannot_fault them .
2	my parcel arrived sooner_than i had expected and the tracking online was helpful & accurate .
2	the driver was cheerful and the package was in good condition .
2	i would not_hesitate to use them in the future .
2	well_done , yodel .
2	in october_0000 we ordered a roof lantern from roof - maker .
2	we were building a new extension so thought it would be ideal and we were not disappointed .
2	we live on the isle of wight so we had to have a freight company bring it here .
2	unfortunately , en_route to the island one of the glass panels got cracked and so we had to have it returned to roof - maker for them to replace it .
2	they were very quick to do this and very soon we had it safely back .
2	( communications with roof - maker are excellent and they keep you informed and updated_regularly .)
2	then our own builders installed it using a fork lift truck with an extending boom to put it onto the roof ( nail - biting few_minutes !!).
2	now it '_s in place we are delighted with how it looks .
2	everyone who comes into the house says ' wow !'
2	as soon as they see it .
2	our own builder is now going to recommend the company to his customers as is our roofer !
2	in fact , our roofer is going to order one for his father - in - law '_s house very soon .
2	do not_hesitate to order from this company they are fab !!
2	!
2	what a great company this is .
2	you have a wonderful selection of quality lights at reasonable_prices .
2	the website is very user_friendly and the communication is first_class .
2	delivery is perfect .
2	i had to reschedule mine as it was inconvenient .
2	it arrived today as requested and perfectly packaged .
2	unfortunately my new extension is still being built so i can '_t put the light up yet but i know it '_ll look fantastic .
2	thank_you all at ocean_lighting !
2	marilyn legg
2	this is a brilliant website .
2	lots of offers and handy_tips for saving money .
2	keep it up !
2	i ordered a tens_machine 00 november , which i needed urgently .
2	when it did not arrive i chased it on 00 november and was told it had been out of stock but had just come in that day .
2	i recieved the tens 0_days_later .
2	i must_say i am unimpressed with the communication .
2	very happy with the " beat our competitor " deal they offer .
2	super easy account sign up and transaction .
2	as a result i doubled my order and i will order again !
2	great company !
2	:_d
2	hostelbookers is a great website , easy to use so i will use again .
2	i initially had some trouble after typing in the address to my search_engine as my computer kept switching to an_alternative site .. not sure why that happened .
2	my dear_friend who is now 00 was thrilled to bits with her gift of serenata_flowers made it so easy to order from australia .
2	thank_you ,
2	yvonne mckerley
2	great service , very competitive_prices , speedy delivery .
2	i will definitely recommend to family & friends .
2	excellent service ; very fast delivery ; great communication .
2	i will be recommending this site to all my friends and will definitely use again myself .
2	can '_t fault my purchase from ordering to delivery .
2	thank_you
2	have used this company for quite some time and have always been delighted with the results , never had a problem , usually takes 0 - 00 days , would definitely recommend
2	i '_ve now had three pairs of glasses from speckyfoureyes , and i love them all .
2	the online ordering system was straightforward , the staff on the phone were friendly and helpful , and delivery was prompt , most of all the style and quality are fabulous .
2	i '_ll buy again , and again , and again from you ....
2	i '_m one happy customer !
2	brilliant value for money , friendly , helpful staff cant do enough for you .
2	wifi is cheep rooms are clean and the bed and bedding are great , we have always had a good nights_sleep in a premier_inn .
2	further to my earlier comment , ive now had a reply from easy wellies who seem to think its acceptable to charge for 0 day delivery even_though they cant deliver on it then refuse to refund money saying its the fault of the weather , i have taken legal_advice and been told they are in breach of contract but as the amount is £ 0 . 00 . its not worth pursuing . iguess thats how they get away with this sort of unacceptable practice .
2	easy wellies hard lesson .
2	i have only placed one order with them so far ... but their response was very quick ... all tracking_information was supplied and the delivery was extremely quick :)... very happy to use them again
2	as a first time user .. i am very impressed with the vision ego kit i have ... great delivery time ... sturdy kit ... had a small problem that was solved immediately by the company ... and the juice is very nice !
2	i will be a regular buyer from the company .. and will be recommending it to friends who would like to try vaping !
2	make_sure you read the delivery rules .
2	the delivery man would not deliver even inside the entrance of the home , he said he was not insured to enter the property !!
2	!
2	so if you want your items delivered in the street , by all means !
2	!
2	wonderful service .
2	ordered my tiles just after 0 . 00 p . m and they were delivered the next_day before 0 . 00 a . m .
2	customer service also excellent , every query answered by very friendly staff .
2	will definitely use this company again , and would have no_hesitation in recommending to my friends and family .
2	ive used amazon on numerous_occassions and cannot_fault them its basically the one stop_shop . everything ive looked for ive found through them and sometimes the p_&_p is cheaper_than going direct to the companys
2	this was my first time to recycle a mobile in this way , and i found the process painfree and efficient .
2	mazuma kept their side of the bargain and paid the money into my account speedily .
2	would use them again with no_qualms .
2	the car_park seems to be so far away from the airport and the buses not as frequent as it could be , but these are things that can be overlooked for the excellent price .
2	unfortunately when we arrived to collect our keys it took a while as they were put in the wrong hook , no big deal but when we went to start the car , the key was broken .. now the wrong hook made sense !
2	it was lucky my husband carries the spare_key .
2	we complaint right there and then but it seems to be taking more than necessary to get approval to order our key ... let '_s hope it all ends well .
2	shame that one unscrupulous employee can mar your reputation just for not being honest !
2	our mallorcan holiday in august was a once in a lifetime holiday for all 00 of my family . 0 significant birthdays and a significant wedding_anniversary prompted our idea to treat our 0 sons and their families to a holiday for all .
2	the team at villaplus couldn_'_t have been more helpful or patient with me , both with my original booking and with a couple of queries that came up .
2	our villa was better_than the pictures led us to believe - it was absolutely_fabulous in fact .
2	the gardens were beautiful and well tended with the impressive pool loved by all , from breakfast time to sunset .
2	a full moon looking down on us for the week added a wonderful light to everything .
2	magic .
2	we had a small problem on arrival and another midway_through the week but the villaplus team for the pollensa area responded really quickly to our calls .
2	the information file in the villas was extremely useful .
2	we can '_t fault villaplus in any way and would use them again for a holiday booking .
2	we recommend others to give them a try .
2	i '_ve been shopping at the supplement_warehouse for 0 years and have been pleased with my selections and astounded at the price breaks .
2	i recommend this website to all my gym and health motivated friends .
2	thanks
2	called at the york store this morning the staff where very obliging but unfortunately they didn_'_t have the model we required .
2	but we trailed a smaller system liked the sound so came home and placed an order over the internet .
2	i will_definately be using vetimed again , very prompt delivery and good prices
2	i have used pet_prescription a few_times and they provide a great service and very fast delivery .
2	my dog is on prescription_medication and this is the cheapest company i have found which gives me peace of mind that my dog is able to continue with her treatment .
2	i have used pet_supermarket before as they seemed to be the cheapest for the dog_food i needed .
2	the product was delivered swiftly and if you spend over a certain_amount the delivery is free .
2	i have not hesitation in recommending them .
2	e tyres offer great service , good prices and a very professional mobile fitting service .
2	i have used them several_times and would go no where else .
2	i ordered a lot of party goods at 00 . 00 one morning - the next_day they were all delivered as ordered at 00 . 00 .
2	i didn_'_t pay anything extra for this delivery and was pleasantly_surprised to see the delivery van_pull up with exactly everything i ordered .
2	the quality was excellent .
2	when i get to decorate the venue for my party its going to look great thanks to partyrama .
2	i booked car_rental with car del_mar for a trip in december and i had problems .
2	i carried on with my february booking with advantage at toulouse via car del_mar .
2	i wish i hadnt .
2	at_least this time i knew where to find them - 00 minute_walk from the terminal in sub_zero temperatures .
2	at the office i had to wait 00_minutes before anyone came to the counter .
2	the booking process was quicker this time but as i was booking the car for over 0_days i had to pay for a tank of diesel - luckily i used the whole tank otherwise they wouldve made money out of this .
2	i then went to find the car .
2	it wasnt where they said it was and when i found it the car hadnt been cleaned .
2	it had been wiped over and looked terrible due to the snow / salt marks on it so i couldnt really examine it for damage .
2	as i had to drive 0 hours i didnt want to wait for it to be washed .
2	apart_from that the car was ok . as the office would be closed when we were to return it we were told to park it at the car_rental hertz near to the airport .
2	on return we did this and hertz initially would not accept it and said we had to take it back to advantage .
2	we refused and eventually hertz accepted the car .
2	i am now awaiting the final_bill for the fuel and the additional driver as hertz inisited on taking all the paperwork including the itemised bill for these items .
2	if i am charged for anything_else i will be expecting a refund .
2	i will be very careful in future not to accept a booking using advantage as the car supplier at toulouse airport as the difference in price is not worth the reduced level of service you get with them .
2	if you have young_children , lots of bags or reduced mobility do not use advantage as you will struggle to get to the offices .
2	i '_d never before owned an ergonomic chair , and wasn_'_t at all sure that it could be worth several_hundred_pounds .
2	i '_m now sitting very comfortably in a herman_miller sayl chair , and received excellent service throughout from wellworking .
2	their support included :
2	very prompt e_mail from paul in response to my initial_enquiry .
2	loan of a demo chair - very important to me as it would have been a lot of money to spend if the end_result wasn_'_t right .
2	contact the day before delivery to agree time - and they came within the hour_slot .
2	set - up and clear_instructions from david ( demo ) and rupert (" my " chair ).
2	contact number to call if any_queries / problems during the trial period .
2	chair is very adjustable to the user '_s size , gives excellent support , and i '_m no_longer tired and stiff after long_periods at the computer .
2	chair really does encourage you to stretch , move etc , and gives a very good sitting position .
2	i '_d have bought it for the above_reasons even if it had been plug ugly , but in fact it '_s very elegant !
2	excellent service .
2	very easy website to use .
2	measuring_guide excellent , and easy process to change the colour shown in the photo .
2	also like the fact that you get different wearing styles with the different colour garments - i bought a long gilet which became much more versatile when i saw it buttoned and tunic - like , part - buttoned with jeans and boots , etc .
2	knitwear is excellent quallity , lovely designs and colours .
2	i '_ve been a customer and fan now for about 0 years .
2	delivery very prompt , and packages come through the letter - box without you having to wait in .
2	nice blinds at a good price .
2	its a shame that the delivery driver left the long blind out in the open when he got no reply .
2	good job it was not raining !
2	quite good price , but the p_&_p is very high .
2	the staff are very helpful and the product is just what i wanted
2	my order arrived very quickly and i was super impressed with that and the price of the item .
2	i would highly_recommend to anyone .
2	i was a bit_dubious_about ordering the pc from microdream , as you never know what you are letting yourself in for when buying blind like this .
2	however , the transaction was flawless and the pc arrived in good time with all the bells and whistles that i had asked for installed .
2	the case is a bit scuffed , but so what , the pc is only being used as a backup and ancillary unit on my network .
2	job well_done !
2	i seem to have had the same problems as a lot of se customers .
2	0 ) not being told they are hk based
2	0 ) generic replies to emails ( we are sorry for the delay , awaiting dispatch , high_level of orders etc ), none of which answered my questions
2	0 ) upgrading of delivery process
2	i am sure this all stems from the fact that they wait for your order , and take your money , before they source the product .
2	this is highly suspect and very unethical .
2	however , the product did arrive in a reasonable amount of time and i am pleased with the camera .
2	but unless i hear they have raised their game , i will not be using them again .
2	really pleased with my new flit_flops from this company , was amazed_at the price and the fast and efficient ordering and delivery .
2	would highly_recommend them !
2	i have just booked my 0th holiday with low_cost holidays .
2	i have booked trips to the caribbean , las_vegas and spain with them and each time i have found them to be the cheapest by far .
2	they are also extremely easy to deal with and i have never had any_issues or problems at all .
2	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend them .
2	have used low_cost holidays a few_times_now and always pleased with the service
2	order arrived really quickly , however some items were smaller_than_expected and i do not think they are worth price paid , also when i first looked on the site that day it said free brio watch on order over a i think £_00 but by the time i came to placing my order this offer had disappeared and i got a free leg wipe thing in a shoddy looking packet .
2	the only_reason i ordered off this site in the first place couple of years_ago was that they stocked my favourite_perfume which they don_'_t do anymore and now tell me they have not heard of it when i search the site , makes me sad , so come on please_please get_hold of " myqueen " eau_de parfum by alexander_mcqueen again so i can buy more .
2	but i am happy with the order and items i used so far .
2	thanks
2	i came onsite this time to purchase a present for my 00 year_old nephew , he had shown a liking for my husband '_s ck0 cologne so we wanted to get him a small bottle for himself .
2	fd was showing the best price and my husband decided to take_advantage of the single postage charge by ordering himself a large bottle ( also much_cheaper_than elsewhere ) at the same time .
2	dabbling around on the site i came_across the bargain cosmetic products and deciding that what was sauce for gander was also sauce for the goose , i also jumped into that postage deal and ordered myself , my sister - in - law and niece loads of lovely cheap nail goodies - well at those prices it would have been rude not to !
2	i hadn_'_t realised that fd sold makeup - shows how much attention i take , lol , but do have a look for yourself , there are some great top names , opi , bourjois etc and all at fantastic prices .
2	because there was a birthday_present involved i paid £ 0 extra on the already reasonable £ 0 . 00 postage to get it here that bit quicker and it did arrive it time , thank_you , fd .
2	i was a bit_nervous as it seemed a long time before it was actually dispatched but perhaps that was just me , having left everything to the last_minute as usual .
2	flights booked for 0 people to sri_lanka , for our sons_wedding , great service , helpful throughout .
2	conrad at manchester was our consultant who was excellent .
2	i had already_recommended them to another family_member who got great service
2	due to my circumstances i had to change and cancel a flight , but nothing was too much_trouble .
2	good value flights , and i would recommend and use them again .
2	i purchased an inspiron desk top from dell and their sevice was second to none .
2	great communication and as i am not an expert of the computer world , i received all the information and guidance required from the sales_department and saved money at the same time , as the sales_person took the time to find out what exactly the desk top would be used for i . e .
2	emails , surfing the net et .
2	or for a small business ?
2	delievery was quick also :
2	thank_you dell
2	i purchased a mattress from this company and it is a lovely product , the service was excellent , terrific price with super_fast delivery , i will definitely use company again and would highly_recommend them

2	recommended .
2	i ordered some boots on sunday , they were despatched monday and delivered tuesday - this was the free supersaver delivery just before christmas .
2	gear for girls sells lovely stuff , usually with a bit of a discount off rrp and provides a friendly and efficient service .
2	it is my go - to company for outdoor_gear and i recommend them to you to !
2	i purchased 0 bottles of specialist anti_- perspirent that retails in b *** s for £ 0 . 00 each .
2	at chemist_direct they were £ 0 . 00 each and , even with postage , i saved money !
2	!
2	package arrived within a few_days - very pleased .
2	will definitely look for other purchases from them .
2	located just a very short_distance from leeds_bradford airport , sentinel_car_parking was efficient , hassle_free and the office and shuttlebus staff friendly .
2	great rates too !
2	we made an impulse purchase at dixons manchester_airport on 00 march_0000 of a panasonic waterproof dvd camera , specifically to capture our day at discovery_cove but also useful for the rest of our holiday too - or so we thought .
2	sunday 00 march discovery_cove , husband takes camera into pool to film and the screen fills with water , absolutely no use whatsoever .
2	not one second of film .
2	informed dixons via_email when we had internet access to be told that thier refund policy was 00 days .
2	as we are in the us until 00 april we would be outside their refund period but we could contact panasonic to have the camera repaired .
2	as it hasn_'_t ever actually worked , how can it be repaired .
2	it failed to meet the purpose it was purchased for and therefore is no_longer required .
2	fortunately , our son is returning to the uk just a day inside the refund period and , as the purchase was made in cash , it will be returned for a full_refund as it is faulty and not fit for purpose under the trades description act .
2	this review is posted as a heads up to anyone who is tempted to make a purchase at manchester_airport or any other dixons airport store , and who is likely to be outside the uk beyond the dixon '_s 00 day refund period .
2	they do not take any circumstance into account and i have the emails to back this up .
2	a recurring theme it seems .
2	website stated ' in stock ' despatch 0 - 0_days , so placed my order , money taken immediately from my credit_card .
2	waited 0_days and called to see check order status .
2	i say called , i never actually spoke to a human !
2	customer helpline is a complete_waste of time .
2	' you are in a queue , your call will be answered in 00_minutes , if you want to hang up and call back the system will recognise your number and put you back in your spot in the queue '.
2	three hours and 0 calls later , all saying the same as above but varying wait times , i decided to email .
2	email was responded to by a ' client experience officer ' who explained that ' due to high_demand they were experiencing delays in despatch '.
2	numerous_emails chasing my order have failed to extract a despatch date from them .
2	my next email will be to cancel the order and to contact mb for my money .
2	having already paid a months interest on it on my cc !
2	!
2	if this company takes £_000 from 0000 ( figure as example only , i '_m_sure the turnover is far , far_greater !!
2	), sits on it for a month with no goods to despatch , even if everyone of the 0000 cancels their order , they will have had interest on £ 0000 for a month .
2	if they were honest about their lead times .
2	if they had said 00 days and meant it i could have decided if that was acceptable to me or not .
2	but to keep pretending or not saying when it will be despatched , it '_s a despicable way to run a business and the authorities should close it down !
2	i will never , ever , ever , ever , ever touch these people again with a bargepole .
2	i would rather pay the extra at argos / pc_world or whoever and have the immediate use of it .
2	lesson_learned .
2	order at your_peril - you might be lucky - you might not , who_knows ?
2	if it quacks like a duck , it is a duck !!
2	!
2	update_:
2	i have just been on se website and they have 0 ipads in stock so i was thinking of ordering one .

2	they came up tops .
2	good value for money , great efficient service and i really like the fact that my car goes to a local_independent garage .

2	wish i had spotted these reviews 0_weeks_ago !!!!!
2	when i placed an order ......................... which guess_what ?
2	i haven_'_t received , like the other people on this site i have telephoned and sent emails - no response . the phone line just tells you to email them .
2	do not use this company !!
2	!
2	i contacted uk_pianos as i was considering buying a digital_piano and didn_'_t have a clue_where to start .
2	they couldn_'_t not have been more helpful giving loads of information and answering my many questions .
2	at no time did i feel i was being put under any pressure to purchase from them , although with their extensive_knowledge i cannot see why one would want to go_anywhere_else .
2	a first_class service which is rare o find nowadays .
2	this is the first purchase i have made at allsole , but i , m_glad i did .
2	gorgeous boots , and fantastic and very quick free delivery .
2	i think the service is fantastic , and will definitely buy from this company again , i would highly_recommend them .
2	i ordered a lulu guinness lips purse , which arrived very quickly , beautifully_wrapped .

2	so i contacted the company , who were so helpful and told me how to send it back .
2	i sent it back , and the speed with which the company refunded me was fantastic , they refunded me the next_day , which has never happened with any company before .
2	i will certainly buy from them again , and can , t recommend them highly_enough .
2	this is the standerd every company should strive for .
2	i , m just sorry it '_s taken me so long to find them .
2	i , m one very happy customer .
2	i have used this company many_times as i , m addicted to their large china dunoon_mugs , i have also sent a dinner service as a wedding present , which was received very quickly and in perfect_condition .
2	i also recently bought some of their soft baby toys for my new_born baby niece , about six of them , in the sale , i couldn_'_t_resist , they were gorgeous , and arrived much_quicker_than estimated .
2	my latest purchase , was a present of a large dunoon mug and soft_toy , sent to belgium , i was told it probably_wouldn , t arrive in time for the birthday because i had left it a bit late for posting , but as always , temptation , s was just being cautious , it arrived very quickly , and in perfect_condition .
2	when a mug i ordered , once arrived broken , temptation , s was fabulous , they quickly dispatched another one to me , with of cause no extra_charge .
2	i can , t recommend this company highly_enough , whenever i have spoken in person to anyone from the company , each and everyone of them is fantastic , and couldn_'_t be more helpfull if they tried .

2	best_wishes , temptation , for your excellent service and attention to detail , long may it continue .
2	sharon davies ( manchester ) a very satisfied_customer .
2	i had to send 0 cases back , which was not the fault of the company , but i have to say , the treatment i received from the customer service department was second to none .
2	they couldn_'_t do enough for me , they were curtius , very obliging and did everything super quickly and efficiently .
2	i have now purchased two more cases , and expect they will be fine .
2	i have no problem recommending this company , and their highly trained_staff .
2	there is something for everyone at temptation_gifts .
2	i stumbled_upon this website by_accident whilst looking for a gift for a friend who has everything - needless to say i found the perfect present .

2	i always come_back to supplement_warehouse because they have the products i want and are still more affordable than the stores despite the shipping_costs .
2	it '_s always the same drill .
2	i run_out of protein_powder , go to the health store , see the price and make the wise decision to be patient and order from supplement_warehouse .
2	my pension was complicated by the fact that i have had six different providers over the years .
2	age_partnership ( marvin watson ) managed to get an annuity arranged that was 00_% better_than my original estimates suggested .
2	the whole_process has taken slightly_longer_than_anticipated , but i have been kept_informed about progress .
2	i would recommend them to anyone looking for an annuity .
2	000000
2	excellent service - product arrived sooner_than_expected .
2	company recommended by golfing friend and i have since passed on the recommendation to other golfers .
2	i have used mazuma before and it is so easy and they are very quick to pay .
2	will always recommend mazuma .
2	good variety and reasonable_prices also free_p_&_p .

2	we have 0 0_seater leather_sofas .
2	( eiger model ) only had them 0_months and find them very uncomfortable .
2	sitting on the metal bar and springs and huge gap at back of cushion when sat on it .
2	contacted customer_services who sent their inspector .
2	he informed us that there was nothing wrong with the sofas and this is to be expected if you suit on them for more than 0 minutes .
2	so now we have to go into debt to buy replacements .
2	a lot of messing for little money , ok telling you of each process that is going on but all that for so little
2	i needed my new glasses adjusting as they were to big .

2	i tried my 00 year_old_son '_s costume on him and noticed it was ripped around the arm and it had a stain on the back . i sent it back for a refund and had an_email back stating that i had done the damage so i would not get a refund . i was appalled that i was accused of doing the damage and that i was not telling them the truth . i have neither a costume or refund now . i will never order from this site again .
2	great product , fast delivery , good price
2	this is the second time i have used this company .

2	travelling with jet 0 was , from_start to finish a stress_free experience .
2	the price was the lowest when i booked ( a rival airlines prices ended_up being lower before we travelled ) but i would happily pay a little more for the friendly efficient service we received from booking to travelling .
2	the flight itself was comfortable with nice leather seats and good leg_room .
2	when we dropped our bags on the outward_journey the man next to us had a problem in that his partner had gone ahead and he was trying to check her bag in .
2	the man from jet 0 behind the counter could not have been more polite or patient if it had been a celebrity who had the problem .
2	indeed all the staff at both airports had this manner .
2	i fully_intend to travel with them again as often as possible and am only sorry they have changed my destination time to a very early slot next year .
2	used pharmacy_0u several_times and always had my products delivered the next_day .

2	my husband had a motor_bike engine that had to be sent to england , i went on the internet to check for a company that would collect and deliver the engine . i got the best price from parcel0go . i put my order in on a tuesday night and the following_morning at 00am the pick_up was made .
2	the engine was delivered to its_destination on the friday . i highly_recommend this company and a big thanks to peter_chandler for his help .
2	had qualified for a free gift , it was in my basket , however somehow lost it on checkout .
2	when i contacted cheap_smells they refused to honour gift .
2	i thoroughly reccommend buying from the cloggs website , you can try youe shoes on in comfort in your_own_home , and if unsuitable they have an easy , no_fuss returns process .
2	with the price i paid for my fitflops , in the cloggs sale , its a bit of a " no_brainer " buying from cloggs .
2	first time i had ever ordered flowers on line , i couldnt_believe_how quick they were delivered they brought a smile to my mums_face especially the heart what i purchased to go on them i thought the price was very reasonable and will be using them again in the future ...
2	terrible service i ordered flowers in good time and didn_'_t arrive on specific day i contacted eflorist who just told me i should have read small_print and used a florist if i wanted them for a specific day i felt the adviser was having a laugh at my expense .... they arrived a day late but wasn_'_t left even_though i left clear delivery instructions emails haven_'_t been answered .... please read other review sites to get a clear picture of this company ... they just don_'_t care about the customer when things go_wrong and ignore you
2	management at tesco alloa , appalling .
2	bitchy and getting other staff into trouble .
2	good job there is employment lawyers .
2	one rule for some and another rule for others .
2	how come when all staff doing same thing and management being told by employees of this .
2	one is dismissed .
2	compass and tesco , have u even read the ethics policy at heart of your business ???
2	?
2	was exellent service fast delivery and great choice of nomination_charms
2	ordered easily , delivered on time & well_packaged .

2	great service & easy website to navigate .

2	great communication for delivery & fitters were polite , friendly & efficient .
2	couldn_'_t ask for better service .
2	well_done ao !
2	ordered on a thursday , arrived saturday_morning .
2	well_packed , as ordered & cheaper_than any shops .
2	i love this site !
2	they are quick , efficient and have shoes and boots to die for !
2	all my friends now buy from this site now .
2	never sold a mobile before so was a bit_dubious .
2	however , the money was in my acct in three_days !!
2	fantastic .
2	payplan are fantastic , free and friendly .
2	when my partners business closed because of the recession two years_ago i was the only one in full - time employment .
2	although i had never defaulted on a payment i was finding it increasingly hard to manage .
2	i gave pay plan a call and they sorted everything out , all i had to do was inform my creditors that i had signed_up with them !
2	!
2	shelly
2	very good website and easy to identify parts
2	i have active border_collies who have had their fair share of limps , injuries and more recently orthopaedic surgery .
2	both have been on yumove_tablets for a while with excellent results . one of my dogs developed a nasty pressure sore which responded well to the silver cream and is now fully healed .
2	when i '_ve met staff at various " shows / events " they have always been extremely approachable and very helpful , and have always taken an interest in my pets and their response to the products used .
2	i often ring up to order products and have always been dealt_with in a very friendly and polite manner and service is excellent , usually next_day delivery .
2	have recommended to numerous friends who are equally pleased with the products and service .
2	thank_you
2	eleanor
2	ordered on line .
2	not familiar with the company .
2	however items received very promptly , securely_packaged .
2	no_problems .
2	would recomend to friends / family .
2	thanks .
2	the price of the item was excellent .
2	placing the order on the website was nice and simple .
2	the item was dispatched quickly and i was really impressed with their communication and overall service .
2	i would use eurofit again .
2	after making my booking and payment , i didn_'_t receive any notification of when the fitter would arrive .
2	i made several calls and sent several emails .
2	i was treated as if i was an annoyance , before the fitter finally arrived at 0 :_00pm .
2	the tyres were fitted in the dark which i was not happy about .
2	i received a half - hearted apology and that was all .
2	i will not be using etyres again and i would not recommend them based on this poor experience .
2	i bought practice paper that is as pleasurable to paint on as ' professional ' was at the show , paints at a fraction of many high_street prices , for better quality , and any number of ' bits and pieces ' that i could pick and choose , rather_than having to buy whole sets for one particular item .
2	it was nice not having to ' make up ' to a certain_amount in my basket for free_p_&_p , because members get it free whatever the total .
2	delivery is always within 00_hours , with an_email to let you know it '_s on its way , so you know to have someone in the house .
2	plus , you don_'_t get emails every day or so with requests to buy even more stuff , unlike many online_retailers ; saa understand that even people who paint and draw every day don_'_t use up everything in one sitting , so i never feel hassled by them .
2	all in all , definitely worth the membership for the magazines , the discounts on already competitive_prices , and stuff regularly turning_up in the sale or clearance areas , free lessons each week on the painting and drawing channel , forums , exhibition news , and encouragement all the way , saa gives you everything you need for any project , from equipment and materials , to ' how to ' resources , galleries of reference photos and even email help for queries not covered in their extensive reference section and forums .
2	really glad i joined , i '_ve had a five_star experience from all areas .
2	definitely join and use this site as one of your main stores .
2	beautiful items , arrived within 00_hours , and were very competitively_priced .
2	i '_ll definitely be shopping here again .
2	would recommend this company as the variety of goods is marvellous .
2	quick delivery .
2	will be ordering again .
2	the best courier l have used , never had a breakage reported yet and never lost an item , so in all am quite satisfied with their service and will use them in future
2	unbeatable service .
2	great driver .
2	absolutely would recommend and hope to use again sometime .
2	a pleasure to do_business with .
2	speedy next_day delivery .
2	very reasonable costs for quality goods .
2	i would certainly recommend .
2	they deserve 0_* for their service and communication .
2	£_00 cheaper_than comet for a larder_fridge .
2	online ordering a doddle .
2	selected delivery date and paid .
2	fridge arrived on time .
2	good comms , they telephoned on delivery day to say they would be here within 0 hours and they were .
2	0 year_guarantee with fridge in today '_s world , so happy_bunny all_round .
2	would highly_recommend kitchen science .
2	i think bingocams is a great conception and it '_s a great site .
2	the ch make the games enjoyable and are great .
2	they involve everyone in the room .
2	there is a clique with some players and they can be quite hostile to anyone different winning !
2	!
2	the ch soon nip that in the bud though !!
2	the only_downside is that there are too many of the same winners / jp winners and if you don_'_t play all day every day you have very little chance of winning big .
2	a lot of the promotions are geared up for those who can play in the evening and there is very little incentive for the morning / daytime players to play .
2	paid a good price for drontal from animed .
2	prompt delivery .
2	all good .
2	i will use them next time i need some if they are still the cheapest .
2	good site , easy to use , plenty of choice and info and good prices .
2	delivered promptly .
2	the cat_food i ordered was cheaper_than i had previously paid on another website .
2	i had thought their price was good .
2	quick delivery from viovet , and it was left where i asked , as i was not in for the delivery .
2	plenty of choice available on the site .
2	i had a problem with the first pole that was delivered - it wasn_'_t really straight .
2	on sending photos to illustrate this they offered to replace it .
2	they would have given me a discount with or without photos , but i prefered to have , and soon received a straight pole .
2	terrific 00 the birthday_present
2	truly delighted !!
2	!
2	very rapid & comprehensive response to queries raised , keep you fully_informed of all transactions , etc_., easy to negotiate website & all free .
2	cannot recommend them enough

2	i have used deramores twice_now and both_times i have had really good service , i would definitely use them again , the product is great , and arrives just a few_days after the order has_been placed .
2	is that true ?
2	i want to write a negative_review of dietchef as i am very angry about the service i have received and you won_'_t let_me .
2	ordered a phone at 0pm it was in my hands by 00am th the following_morning , unfortunately it wasn_'_t suitable for my husband needs , spoke to chloe on web chat who was very helpful .
2	will definitely use such a great company again
2	thanks chloe and thanks handtec :-)
2	can '_t fault service or product
2	i have used espares on a number of occasions in the past and always found them most efficient but on the occasion when i got it wrong , when they would have been well within their rights to say " hard luck ", they went out of their way to help .
2	i cannot_praise them enough .
2	afc
2	couldn_'_t be more satisfied with the product and service provided by uk_sport imports .
2	the driver phone the night before delivery to confirm the time he '_d be at our house - and he was spot_on and very helpful and friendly .
2	the table was easy for two people to put up and appears to be excellent value compared to other_sites .
2	fantastic service .
2	the bar_stools were delivered spot_on time .
2	they were so easy to put_together ; are comfortable and look very stylish .
2	an amazing company that i would highly_recommend .
2	this is the second time i have ordered and just as before , my order of multiple items was on my doorstep the day after i ordered , properly packed and everything perfect .
2	based on my experience , i would recommend deramores to anyone .
2	mage til dårlig service skal man lede længe efter !!
2	jeg_har handlet en del på_nettet og altid fået varer leveret til_tiden og_har_jeg returneret noget , har_jeg fået mine penge promte retur .
2	men ikke hos zalando .
2	her skal man åbenbart ringe forgæves mange gange , hvor man_får at vide , at pengene er på kontoen om et_par dage , men nej !
2	nu har_jeg ventet , ringet , skrevet og_der_er gået en måned siden , jeg returnerede min_pakke .
2	øv !
2	et skod firma !
2	det_er første og sidste_gang , jeg_handler der !
2	after my daughter went through black_circles she fully recommended them to me , have to admit so pleased she did .
2	trouble free and straight_forward will be spreading the word to friends and family .... perfect
2	found the trophy_store to be really professional .
2	they actually phoned me to check something i had written on a trophy to make_sure it was right .
2	they made sure i received the trophy in time for the event .
2	will use them again .
2	parcel not received on time after paying premium postal rate !
2	not happy .
2	now have to return item as arrived too late .
2	ordered 0 big_boy bean_bags for my daughter '_s for christmas on 0th_november .
2	told they would be with us week 00 before christmas and they didn_'_t arrive .
2	then told week 0 but that has now gone and now have heard it going to be by end of february .
2	totally_unacceptable .
2	they keep offering me vouchers but i would never ever use this company again .
2	they are a total let_down , the customer service is nil and they make promises they cannot keep !
2	do not order from this company .
2	they took on too many orders and cannot now deliver .
2	they should have stopped the offer when they reached a level they could cope with - not rocket_science just sensible trading !
2	!
2	on my recent return flight from alicante to glasgow our departure was delayed_due to the late arrival of the flight from glasgow .
2	when we boarded the plane the pilot told us this was because they had departed from glasgow in time but had had to divert to gatwick to offload a passenger who had been taken ill during the flight and needed medical attention .
2	it `_s good to know that when the chips are down the best_interests of the passenger come first .
2	i `_m_sure we would all hope they would do the same for us .
2	this is the first time i '_ve_used hellocanvas and i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to use the site again .
2	easy to order and my canvas was delivered , well - packaged , a couple of days_later .
2	it '_s lovely quality and i couldn_'_t find a better price on the internet .
2	i buy multiples of a couple of high value stationery items from digital fusion from time to time .
2	their prices do fluctuate but are always competitive and often beat the competition_hands_down .
2	they weren_'_t keen to open an account , which is fair_enough as i don_'_t buy from them all that regularly , so my goods didn_'_t arrive next_day as arranging the bank_transfer payment took a little time .
2	however once the order was off hold ( the day after i placed it ) the goods were shipped immediately and arrived the next_day ( today ) in perfect_condition .
2	i would also comment that whenever i phone someone picks_up quickly and is knowledgeable and helpful .
2	they cut_off my father '_s phone for non - payment when he had just come out of hospital .
2	he died at home alone 0_days_later , unable to use his community alarm because his phone was cut_off .
2	i had contacted them but they would do nothing on my say - so , wanted to hear from an ill 00 year - old .
2	my dad was a decorated ww0 veteran with a heart of gold , but they didn_'_t care
2	( social worker and home care manager plus nhs also at fault , but that does not excuse bt .)
2	been with them since 0000 , never a problem .
2	good rate , brilliant coverage - even in the wilds of maasailand in tanzania while filming academic stuff , kenya , france , netherlands , belgium , scottish_highlands - only failed at wanlockhead - highest village in scotland , but nothing works there !
2	fully , fully recommend !
2	enjoy !
2	i bought a dell_laptop as i '_d had good experiences with dell in the workplace .
2	took_forever to arrive and impossible to track effectively - seemed to be lost for weeks .
2	all the names and contacts i was given were never to be heard of again .
2	their info was out of date , the delivery company had moved their base 0 years before and told dell many_times , but dell kept giving me the old address .
2	spent hours and hours on phone lines , being cut_off , told garbage , etc .
2	warning : dell assumes you have internet access , which i didn_'_t have till i got the laptop !
2	!
2	used to give me a really hard time because i wouldn_'_t set_up a direct_debit .
2	if my bill wasn_'_t paid the day it was written i was blamed for late payment .
2	finally , over 0_months after i left them they twice used my debit_card_details to take money from my account - " by mistake ".
2	they did return it , but why were they retaining my card_details ????
2	?
2	ps - they may deny it but they are part of british_gas - the amounts debited from my account were listed as british_gas .
2	bread is best around , some fruit and veg good .
2	not good on veggie food .
2	recent shelf rearrangement has_been a pain , no logic to it , just wasting my time .
2	prewrapped cheese is a rip - off compared to the cheeses counter .
2	often have good deals on alcohol , but i don_'_t drink much .
2	cafe is handy , some branches better_than others .
2	they have at last managed to stop the fresh coffee overflowing the cups but he flavour is not as good as it was .
2	great strong bags - especially the ones with apples on them - bring more please !
2	you lost out badly on the time the fire alarms went and i had to go outside , then you unloaded my trolley .
2	i had a broken arm at the time and it had taken half the morning to load it .
2	quality of the coffee in your cafe has dropped dramatically , but you still stock some of the best ground_coffee around .
2	( your mocha limu is fantastic !)
2	don_'_t like having coin operated small trolleys while the big ones don_'_t need a coin .
2	????
2	?
2	most of all your queues after 00pm with only one check - out operator working ( edinburgh jewel )
2	your veggie options are good right now - please don_'_t withdraw them .
2	know you can '_t maybe solve it , but why do you attract massive customers with trolleys laden with junk food and huge loaves of bread ?
2	failed me completely .
2	i have a perfect 000_% rating after over 000 transactions but they believe a seller who failed to deliver hence i lose £_000 and repeatedly close my case .
2	ridiculous .
2	they first uplifted my parcel in november - failed to deliver but claimed they put a card through my door - they did not , i have a metal mail box , nothing gets lost .
2	i had to pay the sender to send again .
2	next uplifted on 00th_dec - now they claim they delivered on 00th to my workplace - nothing but lies !!!
2	after hours of fruitless calls and e_-_mails i went to their depot .
2	manager there admits that they accidentally loaded it with amazon returns , but their tracking continued to claim they delivered to be .
2	ebay ( where it was unfortunately bought :- customer protection - don_'_t make me laugh ) says because yodel tracking shows it was delivered , i must be lying so they repeatedly close my case .
2	this item is antique , rare , irreplaceable , fragile , lost !
2	i am £_000 out of pocket with no hope of making a claim .
2	i '_m going to police .
2	the hotel booking was simple and staright forward and cheaper_than any other website i had tried .
2	have used before and no_problems .
2	i searched for quite a while looking for hotels in cancun and on many websites .
2	ebookers were the cheapest rates and the booking process was simple .
2	confirmation_email was received within minutes of booking so a good service so far .
2	we are not travelling until next year so cannot_comment on the arrival / checking in at our hotel but hopefully there should not be any_problems .
2	ordering was easy , communication fantastic and delivery was spot_on .
2	will def use again .
2	our flight arrived 0 hours late into larnaca but our driver was waiting for us .
2	car was clean , driver very helpful , return_journey also spot_on .
2	would definitely use this service again .
2	thank_you .
2	i had been let_down by a well - known high_street retailer , and found projectorshop 00 on line .
2	i accepted their offer of telephone advice and we quickly found what i needed - no attempt to sell me something higher in price .
2	moreover , the adviser saved me an_enormous amount of money by pointing_out that i did not need to buy a laptop in order to use this projector , the epson eb - s00 ; it would work direct from a usb_stick for my purposes .
2	the product arrived at 0pm one day , and , although i had never used a projector before , i was giving a 0 - hour presentation to a group the very next afternoon .
2	animed is one of the cheapest internet_shopping sites that i have found , also very fast delivery .
2	very satisfied with the the cost of the product and also the speed of receiving it , i would definitely recommend 000vet .
2	recently went to tenerife with jet0 . com , hassle_free holiday from booking lots of emails before travelling with good info .
2	easy to check in online . to returning home .
2	best organised company i have travelled with by far for short haul destinations .
2	airport departure very good , comfy planes , good service in tenerife airport , transfers very good ( private_taxi ) .
2	have already got another holiday booked with them .
2	no comments to add to my comment above , other than that goods came well_packaged and on time
2	i placed my order with blackleaf , having seen the particular lingerie set in a feature with hello magazine .
2	that hello article gave a discount_code that could be used if the order was placed within a specific timeframe . my order was placed in that timeframe , but the discount_code was not accepted on line so i did not get the 00_%_discount . i still went_ahead . i knew when i placed the order that the item would not be dispatched until approx 00rd feb , which was fine . i then received an e_mail from customer_services asking if i did still want to proceed with the order in view of dispatch delay . i immediately replied to that e_mail , to confirm the order . in that e_mail i asked that someone should please look into and contact me to explain_why the discount_code was not accepted . to date , no one has bothered to do so . this was my first order from blacckleaf . at this rate , i am unlikely to place another order
2	i ordered a power_tool ( metabo kgs000m laser slide compound mitre_saw 000v ) for a birthday_present for my husband .

2	i would recommend mazuma to anyone who_wants a hassle_free transaction with a fast payment .
2	i would rate this company a 0 .
2	i ordered the arrangement a week before christmas to be delivered on the 00nd .
2	it was not delivered until the week_later .
2	this was a christmas center piece which was useless after the holidays .
2	there was no card or note from us in the delivery so my parents did not know who sent it until i asked if they recieved it and ther was no name of the florist .
2	i would have appreciated an e_- mail if they knew they would be late and figure_out a way to change the order to something that was more appropriate for the new year !!!
2	i will never use this web_site or florist again unless i get a refund !
2	ordered online , delivery slot was between 0 - 00p . m .
2	- arrived at 0p . m .
2	on the dot .
2	can '_t beat that .
2	excellent service and goods .

2	would certainly recommend this company to all .

2	it was a good sized room , very clean and very comfortable , it was centrally_located and still quiet , the staff were very friendly and we had no_problems whilst staying there .
2	overall it was a very pleasant stay .
2	these are perfect for what i wanted , strong with lots of room for storing clothes , they arrived very quickly cannot_fault item or service .
2	i called pgs in the morning and darren was on site early_afternoon .
2	he quickly diagnosed the problem , let_me know what parts were need and how long it would take to repair the fault .
2	he kept me informed with progress , and came back today to fit the replacement_parts , taking less time than estimated - always a plus !
2	finding a good reliable plumber is always tricky , so many dont want to come out for the small jobs .
2	i would definately use pgs again .
2	i sent 0 phones by ordinary_post on a friday_afternoon , and the money was in my account by monday_evening - more than met my expectations !
2	i would definately use mazuma again .
2	the service from_start to finish was excellent .
2	mazuma e_- mailed me every_step of the way and the money was in my account when they said it would be .
2	very pleased and would use them again .
2	so if your thinking of trying mazuma_mobile to recycle your old phone , read some of the reviews ... they really are a company to trust and they offer a great price for your phone .
2	posted my fone off sunday wednesday funds were in my account fabulous !!!
2	!

2	if only i '_d read the reviews before i placed my order .
2	i ordered a special thank - you gift of sunflowers , prosecco & a teddy_bear for my daughter and family at vast expense .
2	i paid an extra £ 0 . 00 to have them delivered yesterday evening but they didn_'_t arrive ( i had of course to spoil the surprise as i had to ask my daughter if anything had come ).
2	i emailed and phoned and after hanging on for ages and then being cut_off i finally got through to someone_who gave a half - hearted apology and said she would ring me in the morning to tell me what had happened .
2	no - one rang .
2	i emailed again and then rang them myself .
2	no - one could explain what had happened but i was told that the delivery would be made this evening instead .
2	surprise_surprise !
2	no delivery again .
2	i have just spoken to them and have been promised a re - delivery next tuesday !
2	( with fresh flowers ) they say they have refunded the delivery charge and also the cost of the teddy_bear but after_reading all the reviews i '_ll believe it when / if it happens .
2	i agree with everyone else - always read_reviews first , and never use this company

2	off to look on the website for something_else !
2	i use ebay a lot and have not had any_problems what so ever with anything i have purchased .
2	you do have to be careful as some things are not such good bargains especially if you bid for used items , i have found new cheaper items elswhere .
2	best for price on internet but have just noticed that the icarus 000 has_gone up by £_00 . 00 since i purchased mine ( lucky me ) spent 0_weeks trawling the internet and stumbled_across this site and didn_'_t_hesitate to buy , delivery was really speedy would definately use them again for other purchases and recommend them to others .
2	well_done keep_up the good customer service .
2	from the first moment i contacted e_- careers to the last word of the course i found the company both helpful and friendly .
2	any time i found myself struggling to get to grips with the course they were there to answer my questions and to show how to do things in simpler way .
2	have thoroughly_enjoyed the learning process and am looking_forward to possibly completing another course .
2	many_thanks to you all at e_- careers .

2	i ordered flowers and a teddy for my sister on her_birthday for same day delivery and they arrived later in the day .
2	they were left with a neighbour as my sister was out having a birthday lunch .
2	when she came back her neighbour brought them round and my sister was absolutely_thrilled and delighted - the flowers themselves were so beautiful and she loved them and loved the teddy !
2	i received a text_message from teleflorist to confirm that the flowers had been delivered .
2	the order had been made completely on line and it was extremely reassuring to know that the arrangements had all lgone smoothly as i live several hours away from my sister and could not be with her on her_birthday .

2	happy customer x
2	the items were accurately presented and photographed and arrived speedily , well_packed and the postage was free !
2	impressive and recommended ebay_seller
2	i received a bunch of flowers and a box of chocolates from a friend .
2	the flowers were just about acceptable although two stems were snapped , and the 0 roses only lasted two_days .
2	the 000 g duc d ' o belgian luxury chocolates which were paid for as an extra were actually out of date when they arrived .
2	i contacted the company and had to prove this by sending a photo , which i did .
2	ten days ago they promised to send a replacement box of chocolates .
2	they never arrived , so i chased up this week and today i received a 000g sloane square chocolates which had been wrapped in a piece of a0 paper and were smashed to pieces .
2	so what i got was an inferior ( the company sloane square is located in lancashire and is a brand of the colonial gift company which is used by prestige ) and smaller box of chocolates now in pieces .
2	i have been told that i have to send another photo and they will send out another box also wrapped in an a0 piece of paper because they do not have any wrapping for boxes of chocolates .
2	this company is a farce - do not waste your money with them .
2	ordered this poster for my son .
2	it was on the wall before i got home from work !
2	very happy with my purchase of three column_radiators .
2	i was recommended to use this company by a builder friend .
2	the prices were competitive compared with other_sites i researched and the products look good .
2	so far only one of the radiators has_been fitted , but it looks really great .
2	am very pleased and i am sure i will use this company again .
2	i cannot_praise this company highly_enough .
2	i communicated with them firstly by phone and i received excellent , friendly and very helpful advice about which coving to choose , followed_by receiving samples by mail .
2	having made my decision i ordered online which was very straightforward and i subsequently exchanged several emails with dave lee who helped ensure that my items were delivered exactly on the date which suited me .
2	he also provided prompt assistance by sending a single length of coving out to me to replace one which had been damaged in transit .
2	i would definitely use this company again .
2	thanks dave !
2	the website is easy to use and i was kept_informed of my anticipated delivery date by email .
2	in fact my lenses were delivered earlier_than originally advised when i placed my order .
2	very pleased and will use again .
2	this is my third desk diary order and once again i have received a beautiful desk diary which oozes quality - very impressed .
2	last_year i tried another well_known_brand which was actually a lot more_expensive but ultimately disappointing in terms of appearance .
2	am extremely pleased with my purchase this year and would definitely recommend aspinal of london diaries .
2	convenient drop_off point , excellent polite staff , no waiting time and a parking location only a couple of miles_away .
2	could not ask for more .

2	was at an ann_summers party as part of a hen_weekend near blackpool on 00th_may_0000 . the rep who turned_up was not the one that we had arranged , she was dirty and smelly and unprepared .
2	00 of us placed orders in excess of £_000 and paid in cash on one order .
2	each of us assumed someone_else had the paperwork , but it seems the rep ( debbie ) didn_'_t give anyone any paperwork .
2	consequently the goods were not delivered as planned .
2	ann_summers have not accepted any responsibility and have stopped_responding to our emails , they have stated that as the reps are classed_as self_employed they have no responsibility and it was our mistake to not get any paperwork .
2	the police state its a civil case so can '_t do anything !
2	i guess we should have realised how shady the rep was when she turned_up , she looked more suited to a dogging dvd or lay - by than a classy hen_party !
2	buyers_beware !
2	great service , great product , great price !
2	thank_you
2	they ' re great .
2	item appeared very quickly was just as_described .
2	communication was brilliant .
2	thank_you .

2	the battery was fitted and working well before friday lunch_time .

2	it was such a pleasant_surprise to have : fool_proof on line shopping , a great product at such a low price , a super_fast delivery and the kind of staff that offer an ' after sales customers service ' other_companies can only dream about .
2	we would happily use tayna again - why would we go_anywhere_else ?
2	i '_ve ordered a few items from lovestretch and love being_able to access great labels from one place .
2	the service has_been excellent - i '_ve had to make a couple of returns and there has_been no problem at all .
2	the free delivery is much_appreciated too .
2	all in all highy recommended .
2	my friends were indeed delighfed and surprised to recieve their roses and frescias together with chocolates on the day i had asked for delivery .
2	they told me they were beautiful and i was so pleased arenaflowers had met my expectations .
2	ordered and dispatched on same day .
2	received goods the next_day - absolutely amazing service !
2	used a comparison web search to find a cheaper tarrif , npower came up cheapest .
2	i emailed then phoned them t arrange to change over to them .
2	was told it would be painless , that they would do all the work .
2	all i had to do was tell my old supplier my meter_readings and then my supplier would be changed .
2	this was back in october .
2	we are now in april and although i left my old supplier 0th_december_0000 i still do not know my account number , i still don_'_t have a direct_debit set_up and have now got a bill which they still have not sent me and cannot tell me how much it is over the phone .
2	i have phoned and been told that there was a problem which would be sorted soon , this was back in january .
2	in march i phoned again when i noticed that no money had been taken out my account and was told that a complaint would have to be raised and this would be done immediately .
2	they could see there was a problem with the account and it would be sorted .
2	i then received an_email 0_weeks_ago confirming that someone would be in touch shortly and to assure me the problem would be sorted .
2	still_waiting .
2	emailed them 0_days ago telling them they had 0_days to sort it or i would be moving supplier .
2	they cherish my custom so much the have not bothered to reply .
2	do not touch them , they are rubbish .
2	i now owe a bill i cannot_afford even_though i still don_'_t know how much it will be by the time they get the problem sorted .
2	i bought this for my dad .
2	he wanted to stop_smoking but has_been smoking for over 00 years and had tried the e cigarettes you can buy at garages .
2	although he tried hard to use these instead of cigarettes he just didn_'_t get the satisfaction from them .
2	he talked to someone_who had tried the safersigs and recommeded them .
2	i phoned darren from safercigs and asked about what i needed as a starterpack for my dad and he was extremely_helpful .
2	sent me links to what to buy online and a link to a video to show how to use them .
2	after receiving them within a week , my dad was up and running .
2	he had a bit of a hiccup at the start and did not really manage to get a satisfactory smoke from them so i emailed darren and explained the problem he was having , he emailed straight back and told me how to work it which i explained to my dad and it worked perfectely .
2	very friendly and helpful service , would recommend them .
2	had real trouble_finding a pole to fit our bay_window .
2	some of them after_reading the instructions was needing someone a lot brighter and handier than me to put them up .
2	i cam_across this site and clicked on them expecting much the same but lo and behold a description of the pole i could understand and it looked like it would be easy enough to put up .
2	ordered the size and design on the easy to navigate website and within 0_days my pole had arrived .
2	checked it out and all the bits were there , the design and sizes were as advertised .
2	i only had to cut one of the poles to length but that was an easy job .
2	it has very handy elbow brackets which allow for my shallow bay_window and looks really good .
2	would recommend .
2	oh and the price was reasonable too .
2	there are cheaper poles out there but the width of the pole is too thin and the brackets are cheap and nasty .
2	if i could i would give no stars for this .
2	tried to pay off balance on card 0_weeks_ago and still trying while the interest just adds_up .
2	spent a fortune on phone_calls to customer service , received a couple of emails_telling_me someone would phone me and almost a fortnight later still_waiting on the never coming phone_call .
2	i eventually gave up again and phoned them in yet another failed attempt to pay off the card and after 00_mins i got transferred to someone " higher up " in customer service who offered to freeze the interest until the start of april when i would be able to pay off the card ( apparently you can only make 0 payments in any one month before their system won_'_t allow another payment on the account ), even_though my attempts to pay failed they still count as payments .
2	she then asked me if i was happy with the outcome , which i was not as it did not sort the problem as i could still not pay off my card and no one from customer service had called me when they said they would , she then told me she could not freeze the interest and my complaint would be sent to another department .
2	so barclay card was trying to buy me off for a few_pounds of interest .
2	no way .
2	i then received an_email 00 days ago saying someone would be in touch in 0_days , still no phone_call , email or letter .
2	atrocious service .
2	i tried on the 0nd_april to pay off card and once again was unsuccessful .
2	dont understand_why i can '_t pay off the balance , i have enough money in my account , my details are up to date .
2	i just want to get_rid of my card debt but barclay card are holding me to randsom by now allowing this and charging me more interest every day , then not phoning when they say they will .
2	as soon as i can i will be cancelling this account .
2	don_'_t touch barclay card , their customer service is rubbish .
2	when i first came upon this site , i really liked it as i thought i was getting honest_opinions of shopping sites .
2	i even posted a couple of reviews of companies i had bought from and after_reading comments about companies i was thinking of buying from changed my mind about them and tried another company which had good reviews .
2	so far so good .
2	that is until i bought furniture from oakfurnitureland . co . uk and received below_par furniture , i posted a review which was removed , i received an_email from trustpilot asking me to verify i actually had dealings with the company as the company could not verify i was a customer from the information on the trustpilot website .
2	i sent trustpilot my receipt to prove i was a genuine customer but almost two_weeks_later my review is still not showing .
2	on scrolling down the reviews of this company i noticed they had excellent reviews but a lot of reviews had been removed and were being investigated , i assume they were giving negative_feedback like myself .
2	what is the point of ths site if the company who gives bad service or sells rubbish stuff can get the reviews removed ?
2	starting to think this might not be a site i can_trust .
2	i have done a lot of online shopping with tesco and i cannot_fault their service .
2	there has_been a few occasions where they don_'_t have the item i have asked for and they give a subsitute .
2	on most occassions the substitute has_been acceptable , the times it has not the driver just took the item back and the money was credited back into my account .
2	the drivers are always friendly and arrive in the time i have asked for .
2	would recommend this type of grocery_shopping for anyone too busy to go to the supermarket or like me just hate going into supermarkets .
2	what is it with this review being taken down as it contravenes their review guidlines ?
2	there is nothing in this review that is untrue and it is my opinion , there are no swear words or members of staff mentioned by name , i have not defamed anyone .
2	it is a true account of my experience with this company .
2	after looking through many of the reviews on here i see that a lot have been removed and mostly only excellent ones remain .
2	what is that about ?
2	i have changed my star_rating from 0 to 0 .
2	was looking for an oak coffee_table and oak_nest of tables .
2	after a little searchin online i discovered the perfect table and nest of tables with oakfurnitureland , i was delighted with the price as they were on sale .
2	still a bit expensive but compared to other_websites i thought good value .
2	that was until they arrived , the delivery driver would not wait_till i had checked them as he said he was a 0rd_party delivery and it would not matter if i rejected them as he would not take them back anyway .
2	i signed reluctantly but put on it they were unchecked .
2	i opened the box of the coffee_table and at frist look could see it was very poor quality .
2	the slats that rang along the length of the table did not sit equally , the space between was different from one end to the other end , they were different_lengths .
2	i immediate rang oakfurnitureland , who asked me to take several photos and send them to them , i received a phone_call a couple of days_later to say they would £_00 off the price of the table , allow me an exchange or return the table and get a refund .
2	i opted for a refund and also a refund of the nest of tables ( which i had not even opened so disgusted with the quality of the coffee_table ).
2	after discussion with a manager i finally got them to let_me return the nest for free as i had not just changed my mind about the purchase but the coffee and nest were bought for the one room and one without the other was pointless .
2	the got them picked_up the next_day and a week_later still_waiting on the refund .
2	i phoned 0_days ago to ask where my refund was and they had no knowledge of the items being picked_up even_though i had phoned them when the delivery driver left with the items .
2	fingers_crossed they give me my refund very soon .
2	should have left an update sooner , finally did receive a full_refund .
2	but this would not change my mind about the company , would not recommend them or use them again .
2	it would appear that heatandplum . com have finally gone out of business and the new company that have taken over have said they will not be responsible for any orders placed before 00nd_march and for customers to contact their credit_card company for refunds .
2	absolutely_shocking the amount of time it has taken them to admit this and to still be taking orders and peoples money knowing they would / could not deliver .
2	would not order from the new company if they paid me as can only_assume they knew what was going on and may even be still using the same staff .
2	stay well clear unless you like to fling your money away , if that is the case i can furnish you with my address and you can send it to me .
2	just found what i have been looking for to match my other stuff so excited
2	this product was readily_available and despatched_immediately as advised .
2	still half way through the program , so i can '_t comment just yet as the products effectivness , but hopefully i shall be able to report equally good results in a few_months time .
2	we have used elephant rent a car for a few_years_now and always experience a highly professional company who '_s car_rental offers great value for money .
2	no_hidden_extras with everything included .
2	our latest booking was from the 00th_june to 0th_july_0000 and as there was 0 of us we rented a people carrier with 0 seats and plenty of room for luggage .
2	noni the owner always confirms by email the booking and instructions for meeting the rep at the airport .
2	she also confirmed that 0 children '_s car seats would be fitted for our use .
2	on arrival in cyprus the process takes less_than 00_minutes and policy_documents explained before handing_over the car .
2	the vehicles are always clean and in good condition and come with a half tank of petrol , which you pay for ( 00_euros ) and which you return the car on empty .
2	this is our second booking this year and we will always use elephant rent a car when visiting our villa .
2	we also highly_recommend elephant to our holiday guests , family and friends and will_continue to do_business with them for many more years .
2	a truly great company .
2	stella hunter and family
2	good service and good product .
2	i now have nice bright lights under my kitchen_cupboards .

2	i then ordered a new cistern handle , i wanted this is gold effect , i was immediately sent an_email back saying yes and they would put a link on for me order .
2	by 0 . 00 the next_day the link was there and i was able to place my order .
2	this company is by far the most efficient i have every dealt_with and will have no_hesitation in recommending them to others
2	at last i have found a company with competative_pricing .
2	my cat is on vidalta for the rest of her life which is very costly .
2	medicined0pets are half the price of my vets .
2	i spoke to a helpful person when i had a query and the service and delivery was very quick .
2	if you need new tyres , then contact e tyres .
2	they are really helpful over the phone , when i ordered my tyres i didn_'_t realise there were different_sizes front and back and it was close to their closing time and rob told me not to put the phone down as i wouldn_'_t get through again .
2	once i got the correct sizes , they were ordered and the next_day the fitter was out and tyres_replaced .
2	he even looked at the others and said did i drive like lewis hamilton as the centre of the tyre was worn away !!!
2	so will have another visit from them soon
2	i '_ve_used moon_pig for years and i '_ve always been really happy with everything !
2	i ordered this particular bunch of flowers for my mothers_00th_birthday .
2	she_loves roses and purple .
2	the flowers arrived on time and were well_presented .
2	the colours and arrangement were lovely .
2	i only have two complaints ...
2	the roses , on the second day , have already started to brown at the edges of some petals .
2	secondly , i paid an extra £ 0 . 00 for a bigger ' bunch '.
2	for the price i was expecting more .
2	i '_m a little disappointed to be honest , but , my mother was very happy .
2	i sold a phone that i had had sitting about for quite .
2	the process was easy and simple and i had my cheque in just a few_days !
2	i will be recommending mazuma to all my friends and family !

2	i would recommend this company to anyone and would be please to deal with them again .
2	many_thanks .
2	great place to stay goes past value for money , the staff are lovely and the food was good .
2	i called as i was not sure of something that i wanted to order onto the holiday i '_d already booked , the lady i spoke to was very helpful and made sure that i felt important and that she was interested in what was being said to her .
2	i have now used my hermes for a while .
2	they have never let_me down to date and i feel that i can_trust them with my parcels to get them to where they need to go .
2	i was so pleased with how quick every thing went .
2	i really like how the picture looks on canvas , they done a rel good job .
2	two stainless_steel casserole_dishes ordered .
2	really pleased with them and delivery fantastic - ordered at lunchtime one day and delivered before_lunch the next !
2	only_slight quibble - and this is manufacturers probably , but it drives me nuts !
2	why oh why do they have to stick on labels to this sort of thing which are an_absolute_nightmare to remove - surely there is a glue they can use that dissolves easily in water .
2	apart_from that great - have used procook before and will doubtless use them again .
2	very prompt delivery ( 0_days from order ).
2	excellent communication with update e_-_mails .
2	extremely pleased with mdf bath_panels - very heavy and sturdy and excellent finish .
2	would definitely recommend company .
2	when you order on friday_afternoon and have your order delivered on the following_monday at 0 . 00am in the uk you could be forgiven for thinking it had come from a local supplier .
2	to fulfil the order and deliver it so many thousand miles over a weekend is amazing .
2	very well_done , it could not be done better .
2	i originally ordered a pair of ray_ban wayfarers from sunglasses_shop and they were delivered the very next_day by courier .
2	unfortunately they were a little_bit too_big for me so i had to return them for a refund .
2	the refund was dealth with very quickly and in full .
2	what was also superb is that the return postage was paid for by sunglasses_shop
2	i made another order for a smaller set of sunglasses and again they were delivered the very next_day by courier , and these ones fitted me perfectly
2	i can highly_recommend sunglasses_shop for their absolutely superb service .... very very good service indeed .... thanks
2	i cannot_speak highly_enough of nevada_music .
2	they seem to bend_over_backwards to help the customer .
2	they stock a vast_range of guitars .
2	their premises is huge and stocked to the rafters with gear
2	highly_recommended .....
2	super price on a brand_new rab ladies down jacket
2	i ask webtogs to hold onto it for a couple of days as i was away and they did , not sending it until requested
2	superb service and a superb price
2	very highly_recommended
2	i have been shopping with this company for many_years and have always found them to be helpful and a fantastic company to deal with .
2	i found teleflorist great to use .
2	easy to navigate through the website , with great pictures to see of the array of types of flower_bouquets for sale .
2	great prices - the one i bought was reduced in price , which allowed me to upgrade to the slightly_bigger version .
2	bouquet was delivered on time on the correct date .
2	no_problems .
2	great service .
2	arnis and his assistant managed to get from edinburgh to the highlands of scotland in exactly the time he said it would take him .
2	unlike others who complain_about the distance , or the removal place being rural , arnis just took it all in his stride .
2	they were very , very efficient and only took 0 hours to load up all my goods .
2	they traveled down to norwich that night , to meet me at the drop - off point the next afternoon .
2	they unloaded , again in a very quiet and efficient manner .
2	i have moved several_times , and i found them to be the best removal_firm yet , and at a very reasonable_price .
2	this was a very last_minute move , and yet they arranged it all so as to cause me the least inconvenience possible .
2	they also kept in touch with me by phone and text all the way .
2	i would definitely recommend this company .
2	i was thrilled to instantly find and book a highly_recommended hostel , private_room , in a terrific neighbourhood for a great price !
2	hostel_bookers have a cancellation_policy 00_hours prior and i have just read in my booking confirmation that the hostel will pick me up from the airport !
2	i immediately received a very friendly email with booking confirmation and information to assist me as well as other transport options and tips .
2	i would recommend hostelbookers to anyone , especially given my desired hostel , with it '_s great reviews , was not available on some of the other main websites .
2	i am very excited as it '_s just great to have discovered this site which so easily assists me and others to realise their dream !
2	!
2	first experience of this company and i was impressed .
2	arrived on time with courteous driver .
2	would consider_using them myself .
2	i ordered my electrical bits and pieces late friday .
2	on saturday i received notification of delivery on monday .
2	the order arrived 0am monday !
2	not only were the goods reasonably_priced and of good quality but the service was the best ever .
2	can always trust them to deliver on time .
2	items in stock and good prices .
2	thoroughly recommended
2	excellent product selection with very fast trackable deliveries within 0_days .
2	price for bulk_buying the lowest i could find for my dog '_s favourite food .
2	one of the most reliable retailers i have dealt_with and i will keep buying .
2	ordered a large 00kg_bag of cat_food arrived so quickly free of charge !
2	!
2	i received a free sample of a new perfume in my magazine , as you do , and i thought i '_d give it a try .
2	to my amazement it smelled absolutely_gorgeous , i loved it .
2	i thought i would treat_myself to a bottle , as my usual one was about to run_out , but i was shocked to find it cost around £_00 .
2	when i got home i searched the internet and came_across fragrancedirect who had it as a gift set for under_£_00 !!
2	i ordered it straight_away and it was with me in days , fantastic bargain !
2	thank_you fragrancedirect :)
2	just had my second delivery of dog_food and i am still very impressed with the prices and quality of the service experienced .
2	keep_up the good work petshopbowl , you are blowing your competitors away .
2	i got a great deal and full insurance_cover from alpha_travel_insurance and it was fast and easy to complete online , would definitely recommend you use them .
2	wren_kitchens restored my faith in " ready - made " kitchens , looking at the competition i was in despair that i would find anything i could_afford that would last for years , instead of slowly falling to pieces .
2	the fact that the units came ready_assembled made them much more robust , and the soft_close doors and drawers in the price was excellent .
2	the salesman was brilliant , and helped_me plan every detail , he also supported my husband and i through all the stages , and was happy to speak or email anytime , which was reassuring .
2	i have recommended several people to wren and will_continue to do so .
2	from my initial looking at the website to receiving my glasses was a seamless operation , no_complaints only praise .
2	arrived saturday_afternoon , once i opened the box i realised flowers were all in bud .
2	this i knew would give me longer life on my flowers .
2	they have opened up now and are lovely .
2	recieved the flowers on monday , they were well_wrapped and when i took them out of their wrappers , and followed the instructions on cutting a bit off the stems and putting the liquid food in the vase with water and arranged them .
2	to me they were lovely better_than the picture in the website .
2	i will certainly be ordering flowers again from them and will give their name to my friends .
2	five_star service .
2	goods accurately and helpfully described , well_packed and promptly delivered .
2	recommended !
2	no_problems , good prices , nice and helpfully staff , will buy again from you , i have recommended this company to friends and family ,
2	love my htc leather_wallet ... saved so many dropsies !
2	screen_protector best ever
2	i have now used this service by yodel twice .
2	both_times i was out when the first delivery was made and on the first occasion , i thought i would have to go to a depot somewhere in the middle of nowhere to collect my goods as i have had to do in the past when i missed my delivery .
2	however , yodel supply a mobile phone number for the driver , which when called is answered by the driver when it is safe for him to do so .
2	he ( or presumably she ) then is very helpful and tells you when he will get back to deliver the goods .
2	both_times mine were delivered later the same day , by extremely friendly and cheerful men , who had to find parking_spaces outside my house at a very busy time .
2	it is truly and excellent service .
2	i have no bought online parts from parts_gateway and one of their services several_times_now .
2	the parts are always delivered quickly and are of good quality .
2	when i have to phone to leave my details , i always get really nice blokes on the phone , who don_'_t treat me like a woman_who_knows nothing about cars , ( actually i know a lot ) but as an equal .
2	great service and good prices all_round .
2	my vet_charges £_00 for my horse '_s prescription_drug ( danilon ).
2	at viovet it '_s £_00 so even with the cost of the prescription it '_s much_cheaper .
2	the service was efficient and very quick and i will definitely order from viovet again .
2	this product is great as an owner of 0 cats price was key buying elsewhere was a great expense this company has great prices combined with a fast efficient service
2	great products and really fast delivery .
2	i buy from mighty_deals the good are usually brilliant .
2	i made an order but it was not up to usual mighty_deals , ii contacted mighty_deals and they gave_me a full_refund .
2	customer_services are excellent and ver reliable .
2	i love mighty_deals and bought loads of things from them at prices you cannot_beat .
2	i would recommend mighty_deals to all my friendx and lots of them are also ordering .

2	as i already had a head tennis_racquet it wasn_'_t a difficult choice to make when purchasing a new one .
2	however , as i am over 00 and the racquet that i purchased was designed by steffi graff and andre aggassi for the ' older player ' it seemed the perfect choice .
2	i ordered right then and there and received it within a week .
2	the website was easy to order from .
2	the delivery was extremely prompt , next_day and although i wasn_'_t there to receive the driver left his mobile number so was able to call and make another time delivery .

2	. i have had need to use the chat line service twice , concerning my first ever purchase from trainline .
2	i was very impressed on both_occasions with the speed and efficiency with which my problems were attended to .
2	both issues were resolved , and with courtesy .
2	i am sorry to see other people have not had the same experience as myself .
2	i believe one was named neha and i wish i could remember the other person .
2	i would like to believe they are not the exception and therefore would recommend trainline but particularly their customer service .
2	i only had a very small pension_fund but age_partnership were still very helpful .
2	they did all the necessary_paperwork and kept good contact .

2	i '_ve been using p0go on & off for about a year now and the service has always worked well for me .
2	i '_m not a business just somebody who sends the odd parcel now & then but living in a rural part of scotland the service is vital to me .
2	today for the first time i couldn_'_t get the online pages to accept my parcel for the collection on the day i wanted .
2	so , i used the online_chat link , daniel was my contact & within a very few_minutes he '_d sorted it all out entered all the details and sent me a secure link to pay .

2	the 0 %_off purchases in the future was a pleasant bonus .

2	i had left it rather late to send flowers to a friend for a " special " birthday .
2	having_trawled search_engines i noticed serenataflowers .
2	they offered next_day free delivery if i ordered up to 00 . 00 p . m . that night ( i managed to order at 0 . 00 p . m , nothing like being close to the wire !)
2	and were competitively_priced .
2	serenataflowers kept me informed what was happening all the way along with my order via_text and email .
2	i was well impressed , as was my friend when she received her beautiful_bouquet , having arrived home after a birthday lunch out .
2	she was probably thinking by this time that i had forgotten such a momentous occasion !
2	serenataflowers really saved the day for me and stood head and shoulders_above their_competitors when it comes to service so thank_you from the bottom of my heart .
2	i shall definitely use them again and mention them to all my friends .

2	having various laptops around the house , i wanted a desktop_pc to replace our old ( very old ) one in our study .

2	not knowing too much about pc '_s i emailed darius on various occasions - extremely_helpful .
2	i also read_reviews on microdream and felt very confident ordering from them .
2	i ended_up ordering a ' small form ' dell on the sunday_evening , adding in a dvd re - writer and built in wifi .
2	my pc was delivered on the wednesday_morning at 0 : 00 .
2	plugged it in , working !
2	simple !
2	it is so much_faster_than my other pc , ( although thats not difficult ) i didn_'_t need keyboard , mouse or monitor , although when it was delivered we realised that the plugs on our keyboard and mouse were different to the ' slots ' on the pc , never mind , we ended_up nipping down the road and bought a wireless keyboard and mouse .
2	working brilliantly , free delivery , very happy .
2	would definitely recommend microdream - am now on the hunt for a refurbished_laptop !
2	!

2	well_done .
2	i ordered flowers for delivery the same day for my husband and his brothers and sisters who were together following the death that day of their sister christine .
2	it was a very sad time for all concerned .
2	however , the flowers arrived , i did not request the colours but they could not have been more appropriate !
2	they were bright pinks which christine not only loved , but as she died of breast_cancer were very apt .
2	they were still bright and cheerful the following_monday ( 0 week_later ) and smelled lovely .
2	many_thanks
2	gizzmo_heaven fulfilled my order despite not having one item in stock by upgrading my purchase at no extra_cost .

2	service was quick .

2	i do not rate them at all .
2	they are out to rip people off and i hope they are out of business shortly .
2	if they were an honest company on the final page on their website it would remind one that custom duties will have to be met .
2	they cannot even be bother to reply to one '_s emails .
2	like others have said :
2	don_'_t touch them with a barg pole !!!
2	!
2	the price for the aqualisa_shower was the best i could find and delivery was next_day .

2	ordered 00 / 00 / 00 money taken 00 / 00 / 00 no goods received .
2	can not reach them by e : mail , get no response on live_chat .
2	there phone number is turned on and off and charged at premium_rate so don_'_t call them as they make money from this too .
2	have spoken with amazon to get them to remove them from their site and to advise that the review rating is inaccurate .
2	i am contacting watchdog and trading_standards .
2	and will pursue this to the end .
2	it '_s not the money it '_s the principle !!

2	all clothes are wrong , he '_s fussy with food and he has weird taste in music .
2	but he dives !!
2	watersports_warehouse had all that i needed , it all arrived in excellent time and one item that was out of stock was received just a later and still well in time .
2	they e : mailed me to keep me informed and i was extremely impressed .
2	they '_ve made an old future mother - in - law very happy !
2	disgraceful , uncaring set of people .
2	my disabled aunt and i bought a used car off them in march which was faulty .
2	its been back to the garage four times and each time they have failed to repair it .
2	ive asked for my money back and despite been told they would refund me theyre now refusing .
2	i '_m now told the onus is on me to prove that the cars faulty .
2	i wouldn_'_t mind but i paid 0 grand for it could have been well on my way to a new one with that .
2	its only been on the road a grand_total of 0_weeks since purchase and im now using public_transport .
2	the sale of goods_act isnt worth the paper its written on and trading_standards have been unhelpful .
2	will never deal with this company again and will encourage all those i know to do the same .
2	shame on you stoneacre .
2	( i know there are a lot of positive_reviews on here but wouldn_'_t you think they would want to resolve customer complaints without animosity in order to encourage repeat_custom ?)
2	great value , speedy delivery and best of all free delivery .... or maybe best of all product works .

2	], and the immediate and update_emails received , keeping_me informed of my order .
2	i have recommended animed to many friends and will_continue to do so .
2	thanks for your good service .
2	i chose key_retirement_solutions having thoroughly researched the market .
2	they initially stood_out because of the professional_approach from the very first phone_call .
2	also , and most_importantly , the independent financial_adviser comes to your home ; unlike_some companies which undertake all of their business over the telephone .
2	throughout the process i was dealt_with in a most professional_manner .
2	every question i asked was answered in ' plain_english ', with any ' jargon ' explained as we worked through all the paperwork .
2	also , the independent financial_adviser maintained contact , keeping_me informed_throughout the process so that i knew what to expect , and when .

2	unfortunately i had had a very bad_experience with a major uk retailer ( jlp ) earlier in the week regarding horrendous delivery situation ( hdnl took 0_days to deliver anniversary flowers which were dead by the time they arrived ) so was very nervous purchasing from a retailer with whom i had never dealt_with .

2	we were allocated gold car at faro .
2	when we got there we were presented with two options : either pay the damage_waiver fee of around 000e for a week and drop and leave your car without inspection on return or have 0000e charge placed on your credit_card with a full vehicle inspection on return and where any damage is found the whole amount would be retained - this is extortion at its worst .
2	a young family and an elderly couple in front of us were both forced to pay the waiver fee as they did not have enough credit on their credit_cards - how is this an option ?
2	it is in fact extortion !
2	jet0 needs to look at this very carefully and cease using gold car and any other provider who acts in this despicable manner .
2	it does not reflect well on you !
2	there were so many services to choose from but parcel to go make it easy to see all the options .
2	when i had a question i was online within_seconds and talking to sammie who was able to answer my queries making it easy to decide what to do next .
2	brilliant customer service i would highly_recommend them .
2	unbelievably low_cost .
2	easy check in at dover .
2	ferry is comfy .
2	the onboard shop lacked a great range of wines - many shelves not restocked - but always th eoption to buy in calais .
2	this is the second time we have used the company and we will use them again .
2	an easy way of converting unwanted phone into cash .
2	i came_across this company during an internet_search .
2	ordered the curtains one day and received them the next , even_though i hadn_'_t opted for next_day delivery .
2	the customer service is extraordinary .
2	my only_regret is that i didn_'_t realise they also did poles etc as i could have ordered them at the same time and saved some postage_costs .
2	i will definitely be using this company again .
2	my same branded lenses , delivered for free , to the office and a third of the price
2	i would highly_recommend this company to anyone who was having financial_difficulties .
2	i myself have been with them since 0000 and have never looked back .
2	they have helped_me through some difficult times and still allowed me to see some light at the end of the tunnel .
2	i am totally_satisfied with their service and have no_problems querying anything if i need to .
2	they are helpful , always professional , polite and seem to generally have your interest '_s at the forefront .
2	yes i am totally aware that companies like these do have a close relationship with all creditors & possibly get paid by them for collecting the debt , but this does not alter my view , as i still have a debt which needs reimbursing to my creditors .
2	i always banked for many_years with a certain high_street bank and it was from a phonecall to them that i was advised to seek the advice from them or some other firm like them ................................. for this i thank them .
2	overall very pleased with my experience with them .
2	straight_forward , easy to use and pleasant_experience , will be happy to use again .
2	i ordered an in car cradle that was advertised as having a charger included and aled display to show blackberry was charging .
2	received cradle in post but it does not come with charger and no installation insructions just cheap bits of plastic .
2	cannot make contact on phone keep getting told to call back later by automated_voice .
2	no response to e_- mail to customer_care dept .
2	wil be contacting_trading_standards as i feel i have been defrauded .
2	really enjoy this site with the bonus rounds of bouncing ball .
2	gives you an extra chance of winning some money . also the jackpot_rooms are great !!
2	the ch in the chat rooms are friendly and quite funny !
2	havant played on any other ones since thats how good it is !!
2	keep it up guys !
2	xx
2	first of all , i hate the new website .
2	full of glitches , hard to navigate and their stock_levels are unreliable with some items selling out quickly and not replenished .
2	there isn_'_t enough info about the product and they give no guidance that i can see on the exact lengths of short medium and long for trousers etc which makes_life difficult as the models they use are usually 0 ' 00 so the pictures are no help at all .
2	i am not impressed with this season '_s clothes which veer from dated and boring to quirky and overpriced .
2	they don_'_t seem to be able to decide where to pitch themselves and with shoes for example they offer cheap synthetic heels then jump to decent leather courts at £_000 !
2	what about something in between .
2	i '_d be shopping in lk bennet and upwards if i wanted to spend more than £_000 /£ 000 on a pair of shoes .
2	their underwear , men '_s socks etc still seem ok , but this is hardly enough to keep them going .
2	on the plus_side , their instore delivery is prompt , though it is a shame you can return via simply food .
2	however , seem to have a good range of corner shops that you can return to .
2	so glad i discovered this firm having been cursed with uk size 0 . 0 feet with bunions , i desperately_needed to find a firm that made good quality shoes in my size ( a proper size 0 . 0 and not the skimpy estimates masquerading as that size ).
2	pretty , practical styles in a variety of colours , plus some nice bags too .
2	i wish they would introduce some high_heels alongside their flats and mid height ranges as i would definitely buy and i '_m_sure they would be popular .
2	having said that their sandals this year were lovely with a couple of higher wedge styles that not only looked fantastic , were bliss to wear too .
2	excellent service , great website and , yes , they do send out a lot of marketing info , but i rather think they hope it will be passed round as they offer incentives if you introduce a friend .
2	my mother has bought from them and i '_ve passed their details to a couple of other people .
2	i hope they prosper and widen their customer base because i '_d hate to see them disappear , not just because they are british , but because there are too few footwear companies like this around .
2	check them out !
2	update_: a bit hacked off as went through_quidco to access hughesdirect on promise of cashback .
2	dead silence and quidco has no record of the transaction .
2	not sure who is at fault .
2	however would still use this company as was very happy with the service .
2	delivery date for thursday advised shortly_after order on the monday .
2	my miele_vacuum was well_packaged , was a very competitive price , came with a bag fitted and works_perfectly .
2	went through a cashback site , so hoping that goes through without a problem .
2	would use them again .
2	very robust , good quality wheelchair seatbelt that makes my dad feel very secure .
2	reasonably quick delivery and fair price .
2	vans shoes arrived sooner_than i expected .
2	excellent service - no_problems ,
2	easy to use website , with clear_instructions and a reliable service to send and receive your parcels .
2	no_problems with this one !
2	after using the tennis planet website for the first time recently i wish i '_d had known about it before .
2	my experience was all good .
2	therefore i will use them again and tell all my tennis friends .
2	ordered tyres in nov in stock promised dec for 00 + 00 dec no tyres
2	sent promised refund immediately - no refund until jan .
2	i get a sense that these individuals are very god at the sales_pitch and making money off people at the start but less good at after - care and facing up to responsibilities when things go_wrong .
2	k lewis
2	placed order .
2	price matched .
2	great deal .
2	just awaiting delivery .
2	thanks
2	“ this was the last of a number of items ordered over the past couple of months and would just like to say how impressed i have been with the quality of the items received .

2	would recommend this company .
2	quick delivery , kept up to date , great products .
2	the fold_down table is gorgeous , very well made and great quality .
2	very easy to use , website very clear , had a phone_call from them literally 0 mins after we booked !!
2	to make_sure everything was ok as it was a large booking .
2	paper_work excellent and easy to read thru , will certainly use them again .
2	excellent service , delivery and product .
2	cannot_rate victoria_plumb highly_enough
2	absolutely_brilliant service .
2	i ordered just before christmas - on the monday - and it said next_day delivery !!
2	felt it wouldn_'_t arrive with the christmas hols - but it did !!
2	brilliant service
2	i just want to thank mytuxedo for the excellent response and service following my earlier posting outlining a problem with my recent order .
2	they couldnt have been more understanding and the problem was resolved_immediately on the telephone .
2	well_done
2	this is a brilliant site and i would definitely recommend it to everybody .
2	you might as well , it '_s free and you don_'_t pay any more for your goods but you get money back for buying them , what is there to loose ?
2	it can make a purchase even cheaper in the end and who doesn_'_t want that ?
2	quidco is easy to use and you can track your cashback , any_problems they are happy to help with .
2	the cashback is paid direct into your bank_account you don_'_t have to do anything but buy your goods through the quidco site .
2	the site is quite simple to navigate .
2	some cashback takes_longer_than others , but hey it '_s worth the wait .
2	always check with them before you buy anything to see if the business you ' re buying from is on their site , it '_s easy to remember once you get the hang of it .
2	i was a bit_wary at first cos you don_'_t get anything for nothing , right ?
2	wrong !
2	it actual is brilliant .
2	go on join it , you won_'_t regret it , you '_ve got nothing to loose .
2	i always buy my coffee from discount coffee .
2	never have to wait longer_than two_days .
2	cheaper_than the high_street
2	i dropped my phone in through the letter_box at the mazuma offices as i happened to be passing on sunday_afternoon .
2	on monday_morning , i received confirmation that the order had been processed and a few hours_later the money was in my bank_account .
2	highly , highly_recommended .
2	why go_anywhere_else ?
2	and why_bother with all the hassle of selling via_ebay or amazon !
2	well_done mazuma !
2	i wanted to send my sister in law flowers .
2	the most obvious choice of florist would be interflora .
2	however , i looked online and just wasn_'_t impressed at the bouguets .
2	then i saw the reviews for this company and thought all those people can '_t be wrong .
2	to be in london and flowers arrive in san_diego the next_day is just so impressive .
2	so service was good but most of all the flowers were really beautiful .
2	my sister in law was surprised and thrilled so the desired_effect was achieved .
2	thank_you so much .
2	will always use you for flowers abroad .
2	very good sevice , fast delivery 00 out of 00 .
2	i ordered my beko_fridge_freezer on the 00th_september at about 00 . 00hrs .
2	i paid £ 0 . 00 for next_day delivery .
2	i was given a 0hr time_slot on the morning of the delivery my fridge_freezer arrived at 00 . 00hrs less_than 00hrs from ordering .
2	i am very pleased with ao . com and wouuld order from them again .
2	excellent .
2	the villa was amazing , you couldn_'_t have wished for more .
2	having your_own private_pool was a luxury and a necessity to cool down from the cyprus sun .
2	even my non - swimmer mum was in the pool regularly .
2	the location of the villa was ideal , very peaceful and relaxing , set back off the main_road down a track through a grape vineyard .
2	i didn_'_t hire a car prior to our holiday , i wanted to check the location first but we managed very well using the local buses , and apparently you can buy a weekly ticket , we didn_'_t find this out until the day before we were leaving but at 0 . 00 a trip isn_'_t too bad .
2	i think if you wanted to explore the sites of cyprus then you would definitely need a car .
2	i requested a welcome_pack , which was very handy especially as we arrived late but i would suggest that a small supply of dishwasher and washing_machine tablets could be included .
2	overall , this was the best holiday we have had , we didn_'_t want to leave .
2	website very easy , and delivery excellent
2	i ordered my sister some cologne from cheapsmells for christmas on december 0 , 0000 and i still have not received it as of december 00 , 0000 .
2	now i don_'_t know what i am giving her for christmas .
2	thanks a lot .

2	i not only go here to order vitamins ... bue also to order the wide_variety of oils , such as eucalyptus and lavender oils , at the best prices found online .
2	they provide a detailed_description of each product which they offer , along with an additional_discount if the consumer finds the identical product anywhere_else .
2	they also provide additional products , along with samples , at extremely low_prices or free .
2	wow !

2	yet again some excellent customer service this week from this company , the bigger companies could_learn a thing or two about customer service skills from these .. well_done remi and kate x
2	hugo on live_chat was more than helpful with me having to book a collection before i flew off on holiday big thanks to him for that

2	b ) easy to make the purchase online and very speedy delivery .
2	c ) already delighted because of the excellent ski boot purchase experience previously had
2	all in all five_star service from eb .
2	really enjoyed these tours - we bought the two day ticket including the boat_tour and felt that it allowed_us to maximise our short visit to miami .
2	tour_guides and drivers all friendly - efficient service and what better for a brit than to be travelling on an original london red double_decker !
2	your service delivery is so spot_on .
2	i am blown_away by the swift delivery on my two orders .
2	ordered wednesday_afternoon and arrived thursday morninh .
2	cannot_complain ' cos there '_s nothing to complain_about !
2	well_done
2	i ordered goods from them 0_weeks_ago and still don_'_t have them .
2	i '_ve contacted them on 0 occasions only to be told 0 different stories .
2	today '_s excuse is that they have been unable to fulfil my order due to demand .
2	their paperwork is poor with no contact numbers on the email with the order number on .
2	they are untrustworthy and unreliable .
2	use an_alternative supplier .
2	they did make an_error but i phoned them , got through to an english_speaking person_who sorted it within 0 mins and emailed me .
2	couldn ; t ask for more .
2	i use many car_hire_companies ( at_least 0 a month ) and this organisation has poor customer service , unclear documentation and are generally underhand and difficult to deal with .
2	i ended_up with a car_hire company i hadn_'_t booked with at a location off airport , waited over an_hour for transportation and was then hit for an additional 000_euros that i had not agreed to and i '_m still fighting for a refund on .
2	i '_ve referred the matter to my credit_card company and will take to court if_necessary .
2	do not use and do not trust .
2	i order a camera costing over_£_000 00 aug_0000 .
2	i never received the camera and i '_m still_waiting for a refund ( 00 sept_0000 ).
2	call_centre is in india and the communication is virtually non_existant .
2	emails go without response .
2	theyare impossible to contact and there is no address on their website .
2	reported them to trading_standards and to googlecheckout .
2	find someone_else to spend your money with !
2	from the expert_advice by the friendly staff to the final delivery of my car battery , i was extremely impressed with this company .
2	the price was the best i could find and my battery was delivered the following_day as promised , perfectly packaged .
2	excellent service from beginning to end .
2	would highly_recommend tayna batteries .
2	very good i allways book with alpharooms never had any trouble with bookings
2	the first order did not arrive but as soon as i emailed the company , i got a reply_stating they were looking into it .
2	they sent me another email_saying it had got lost in transit , apologised and asked if i wished to have the goods reordered and sent , free of charge .
2	i said i did , and they arrived within 0_days .
2	excellent service & the person i had emails from brought your company first_class customer service .
2	many_thanks .
2	only_thing this time is that they took twice as long to come as the last time , but they were all worth waiting for !!
2	!
2	i have always received excellent service from littlewoods .
2	it is easy to track the majority of my orders , and it is brilliant that i can say what day i would like them delivered , especially as i work some days .
2	that way i can ensure i am in for them .
2	the quality is very good , and the returns service is brilliant - never any quibble .
2	keep_up the good work !
2	!
2	seamless service and great value - makes regular petfood orders a dream .

2	i am looking for a holiday in salzburg , austria and have not found what i am looking for with last_minute , although they are the first people to come up on a web search they don_'_t do it for me .
2	on friday_night around 0pm i ordered five small kitchen electrical_appliances to a value of £_000 .
2	they arrived the next_morning .
2	they took 00_hours from placing the order to being delivered .
2	i rate that as the most impressive delivery i have ever had .
2	we buy all our small electrical items from amazon .
2	they always come fast , always give refunds if it is wrong , and never make a mistake .
2	brilliant .
2	i '_ve done this flight from heathrow to nassau many_times .
2	the quality of the on - board service varies from excellent to appalling , depending_on who is in the team .
2	therefore i cannot give more than three stars .
2	i have been insulted by cabin_crew and treated like a princess - this does not make for a confident traveller , as you never know how your innocent request for a glass of water is going to be taken .
2	but the pilots usually arrive at the destination on time or early , so it '_s not all bad !
2	i have tried other children shoes but they only last about 0_months - i always end up back at clarks for my daughters shoes .
2	i regularly go to taunton from reigate on the train , this card has saved me thousands of pound .
2	i have just brought my daughter 00 + card for when she travels out and about with friends .
2	just what you need when life '_s little problems come your way .
2	i recently a disaster with my shower called them and rec '_d within a new tray for plumber to fit 0days ...... thank_you .
2	going to need a boiler next year .
2	i use this to all the time to get either my daughter to university or all of us to taunton - brilliant delivers every time
2	best deal online and great customer service .
2	recently took a trip to france for a last weekend .
2	on brittany_ferries - rxcellent
2	i have owned a dyson for 0 years and will never ever use any other make .
2	the customer service staff are brilliant .
2	my daughters uncle brought her a nuo ice_cream maker - it is fantastic .
2	she is 0 and she_loves it ............
2	recently got a parking fine of £_00 . 00 after going to halford '_s redhill surrey and parking in the car_park with halfords sign and their own bays waiting for them to serve me - days_later £_00 . 00 parking fine .
2	customer service has_been rubbish i even email ceo and got a standard reply with spelling_mistake .......... will never shop_here again .
2	interesting to see if they bother to respond again .............. will keep you informed .
2	recently took a world tour new_zealand , australia and thailand on emirates - fantastic airline will always fly emirates .
2	i shop_here as next to daughters_school staff are always very good and react quickly to queues .
2	recently_purchased my daughters netbook online and they ran in to collect - very easy
2	i love the fact i can buy a voucher for children birthday_presents and they can then choose own presents
2	my friends recently_moved to australia and they order from m & s , i then forward on .
2	couple of items had to be returned which i did to redhill the manager is great and very helpful .
2	the flowers my friend received for her_birthday were beautiful , she was really pleased with them .
2	i have used e_florist many_times and i have never been disappointed .
2	buying flowers on line can be precarious as some flowers may not have the high_standard as i have got from e_florist .
2	i was looking for fit_flop boots and found then here , reasonable_price , size in stock .
2	easy site to use and very fast delivery .
2	good value for sunflower_hearts .
2	good quality product .
2	will_definately use again .
2	i have used pet_supermarket for a number of years and have noticed they are not as good as they used to be .
2	several orders recently have not arrived on time .
2	my last order was 0_days late and they didn_'_t respond to my emails asking why it was delayed - so much for their pledge to answer within 0 working day .
2	the only_thing that keeps me going back is the price .
2	i now make_sure i order at_least a week earlier_than i need to with other_companies .
2	i have found that cotswold products are very good quality with reasonable_prices , delivered on time .
2	what else would a customer want ?
2	cotswold has it all !!
2	!
2	outstanding , everything is so easy , need to add much more gift baskets and alot more items for men

2	have been using simply_supplements for a few_years_now and have never needed to question them concerning any orders i have placed with them .
2	they are first_rate in dealing_with you over the telephone and easy as pie to order online .
2	pricewise i don_'_t think they can be_beaten , and their delivery service is excellent .
2	i will_continue to use them for a long time to come .
2	ordered friday_evening , delivery tuesday am .
2	fast and efficient service all_round and product packaged well .
2	will use again .
2	i was a bit_hesitant_about ordering online from a company that i had never used before however my fears were completely_unfounded .
2	the entire_process was seamless from order to delivery , i ordered my fridge_freezer on the thursday and appliance city offered to deliver saturday ( that we couldn_'_t take as we were busy !)
2	the delivery was agreed for the tuesday .
2	the two delivery chaps were the most courteous and friendly delivery drivers that i have had the pleasure of dealing_with , nothing was too much_trouble and they had to overcome a few hurdles to get the freezer into the house as it is so big !!
2	the price for the freezer was also the most competitive i could find online by quite some distance .
2	i have already_recommended appliance city to friends and will have no_hesitation in continuing to recommend them in future .
2	great service , great product , great price , what more can you ask for ?
2	have now used tshirt_studio 0 times .
2	quality is brilliant and service first_class .
2	said before i would use again and i did !
2	great company to deal with .
2	shiply . com , fantastic service & concept , won_'_t have to stalk hubbies diary any longer , to see if i can get him to pick_up my long - distance ebay purchases !!!
2	first two , large furniture items delivered , both carriers top , great price , comms and delivery as arranged on the hour , could not have asked for more !
2	!
2	( ps % commission shiply take appears a bit_steep , seems a little harsh on the carriers !?)
2	booked xbox in as wasn_'_t working and another shop had said they couldn_'_t repair it after having it a week .
2	admittedly did not retest on picking it up from there , just took it to chris .
2	it worked as soon as he plugged it in so no repair was needed but he still checked everything thoroughly .
2	highly_recommended .
2	goods ordered tuesday and were delivered to the locker on the wednesday .
2	cannot ask for anything better_than that
2	i placed the order monday_lunchtime and it was delivered on thurs .
2	great being_able to track my parcel .
2	i am very happy with the lens and i would order from here again
2	my item was dispatched promptly .
2	my only_gripe and this is probably no fault of the company but royal_mail .
2	i put on my note to deliver to my neighbour if i was out and this was clearly_shown on the address_label , unfortunately it seems royal_mail totally_ignored this request and i had to go and collect my package from the sorting_office .
2	other than that spot_on with delivery and communication .
2	thank_you
2	my calendar was perfect and the price was great , would recommend definitely
2	i ordered my glasses and paid for them through paypal .
2	received an_email from selectspecs informing_me that the glasses i had ordered had been_discontinued .
2	when later that month i received my credit_card bill i discovered that they had taken my money and not refunded it .
2	i contacted them through their website requesting a refund but got no reply .
2	i had to go to paypal to obtain a refund .
2	as i had to go elsewhere for my glasses i was unable to pay off my credit_card bill in full and incurred charges .
2	i still_haven_'_t heard from selectspecs not even an_apology .
2	ordered new nets for our_caravan .
2	easy ordering system , arrived within the week and the curtains look brilliant .
2	always great service and prompt delivery .

2	so glad i found this web_site !
2	yay !
2	i ordered these coffee_pods for the second time , they are just as good as promised , they arrived quicker_than i expected and i would recommend them to anybody
2	when looking to replace my old defective gas_hob i was recommended appliances_online by a work_colleague .
2	she said that not only were they good value , but their service during and after sales was good .
2	i looked them up , was offered a decent choice of jobs with good reviews available on all .
2	ordering and payment were straightforward - they even took paypal .
2	once my order went through i had regular_updates on the status of my order , up to the day ( and time ) of delivery .

2	had a great experience dealing_with hi -_fi tower .

2	no damaged boxes or furniture .
2	i was most satisfied with the delivery and the drivers and would certainly recommend this company to all my friends

2	whenever i order from " woollies " i get confirmation immediately , advice on any_issues with delivery dates , i am always kept_informed - i choose when i want the delivery and usually a text comes through on the delivery date or the day before to say the parcel is on its way - 00_% of the time within an_hour or so the parcel is delivered !
2	!
2	i can_honestly_say that i miss woolworths on the high_street - and my mum and sister have said the same too - but to be able to order online is the next best thing and there are so many offers too that i wish i had a higher limit ( hahahahaha )

2	the only_drawback is that my bed is just too comfortable with my new topper . i don_'_t want to get up in the mornings .
2	i double_checked the refund policy on a base_layer top and it was agreed that i could return the item to a millets store , so i purchased 0 sizes online .
2	they did not have the base_layer top in any of the stores that i checked at .
2	the manager stated that they do not refund underwear !
2	( he said that they would refund tea shirts !)
2	it was very frustrating .
2	the rest of the staff were sympathetic and agreed that they would feel upset if they had been mal - informed .
2	one of them was a bit shocked at the price i had paid .
2	the manager made various phone_calls to head_office and other stores in an attempt to find out who had reassured me that they would refund it .
2	it took considerable time for him to eventually agree to refund .
2	i felt very upset .
2	at the time it took .
2	i can not find anything in the refund policy on the web that states that they do not refund items that they consider to be underwear .
2	sorry millets , i am unlikely to shop at millets again because i don_’_t use shops that have refund hassles .
2	top of the pops !
2	sorry , dogs !
2	!
2	super quick delivery and kept me informed .
2	recommended !!
2	!

2	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend this firm .
2	having had a very bad_experience with another online appliance company , i was a bit_nervous_about using peter_tyson .

2	in my experience , the entire staff is nice , helpful , and professional .
2	i highly_recommend them to anyone_needing immigration help .
2	if you need to submit a visa application , there is nothing more important than knowing your immigration case is in good hands .
2	my advice is , don_'_t do the application yourself or try a different firm .
2	the best thing you could do for yourself is call imperial_visas .
2	imperial_visas helped_me with a ltr application and i will definitely use them for my ilr and uk citizenship applications .
2	my thanks goes out to vaibhav tanwar and the entire staff .

2	but , i whimpered , is there nothing you can do .
2	reply : if it can be left with a neighbour i could text to let driver know .
2	hello what do you use to text ?
2	operator replied ( in an irritated manner ) we can only text we ' re not allowed to ring .

2	my mother was continuously getting in a muddle with the tv_remote as her dementa progressed , to the point where she forgot how to use it and even when set_up so it just needed a one button press , the wrong buttons would be pressed and all hell would break loose .
2	this simple on / off + high / low volume + channel change remote has meant she can now use her tv again .
2	so far so good anyway .
2	a huge choice of items to cover all tastes , requirements and pockets .
2	excellent online honest descriptions and speedy delivery - next_day , no problem .
2	you just cannot go_wrong with this company !

2	ordered flowers on sunday , to be delivered to my mum for her_birthday the following wednesday , as advertised .
2	wednesday came no flowers , thursday royal_mail attempted to deliver flowers but mum was out , royal_mail re delivered flowers on saturday_morning , and i wish they hadnt .
2	flowers have been lying in a box without water for a few_days , they were wilting and turnign brown .
2	phoned customer service , not interested , they have not broken any contract , flowers were sent out .
2	they also fail to respond to further emails sent , have been promised someone will phone me soon ( 0_days ago ) nothing .
2	basically they are not interested they have got the money for the flowers , they dont care how and when they are delivered .
2	so basically have paid for dead flowers to be deliverd to my mum 0_days after her_birthday .
2	so upsetting and stressful for my mum and me .
2	never again .
2	best selection of items .
2	ordered at 0 . 00pm one day and received 0 . 00am next_morning !
2	it doesn_'_t get better_than that .
2	the website was really easy to navigate and order from and the lenses were despatched the next_day .
2	no_fuss with the ordering , constant reassurances on the website about being_able to return them if the order was not correct for whatever_reason , and offers to talk about any_queries or eye health_issues if needed .
2	will definitely use again .
2	i have been using this website now for several_years and have always been impressed by the range and quality of the products .
2	my main purchases are evening_primrose oil which is cheaper_than elsewhere but just as effective , and probiotics .
2	i feel fortunate on having found this website , the quality and value for money of the products along with the customer service is excellent .
2	my experiences of eflorist are that the order exceeds my expectations compared to many other_suppliers , including large retail_store online services .
2	the goods arrived two_days after ordering , i was expecting them to be sent by economy delivery as the items were heavy and delivery was free , so was pleasantly_surprised when they turned_up so soon .
2	i didn_'_t have any real expectations - i was desperate for a christmas_present for a friend and put my trust in the reviews on the website .
2	justifiably so !
2	the product was exceptional for the money and despite it being so close to christmas , i was pleasantly_surprised to have the brush_set delivered within 00_hours of ordering .
2	i order sensitivity food for use in our kennels and it most often arrives the next_day - on one occasion it arrived 00_hours after ordering .
2	it is also a good price , so all_round an excellent company to deal with .

2	i ordered £_000 worth of goods .
2	it looks a fantastic proffesional site .
2	better_than others iv visited for the items i needed .
2	anyway the money was immediately taken from my account , and i recieved an_email_saying my order was being_processed and waiting to be despached .
2	two_weeks down the line still no goods .
2	telephoned and i had an answer with the tele no they suggest to ring .
2	after_seeing this site i cancelled the order and was told i would recieve my refund the following friday .
2	this was monday .

2	mmmmmm '
2	anway i did recieve it a week_later on a saturday .
2	there were no good .
2	otherwise i would of had them .
2	from now on ill be checking the sites thoroughly before purchasing anything .
2	from the time they took my payment it was a month before i got my money back .
2	also i sent numerous_emails had none back at first but the 0th week they did reply each time i emailed them .
2	i would not use this site again , but its so proffesionaly done it stands_out from the others .
2	pity the service wasnt the same .
2	mike seemed a nice guy on the phone and appologetic .
2	but that means nothing for the service .

2	the picture on the website provided a good likeness .
2	thank_you .

2	i ordered on the weekend & it arrived on tuesday .
2	from the order to receipt - just a 0 day turn_around - and with 0 of those days being a weekend , the service was impecable .

2	can '_t get better service than that .
2	easy shopping and quick delivery
2	really glad i came_across " tyres on the drive " when searching the internet for tyres .
2	smooth process to order on the internet , phone_call from company to confirm details and time when technician andy would call at my home .
2	he duly turned_up on time and efficiently fitted two new tyres on my fiesta comfortably within an_hour .
2	he was also friendly , courteous and helpful .
2	very pleased with the whole_experience and would readily recommend family , friends and anyone_else prepared to listen .
2	oh and the price was the cheapest i could find too .
2	andrew whalley .
2	service very good .
2	registered on website and within a few_days the box arrived to send my glasses back to them .

2	on sunday 0th_january i ordered a mattress from world_stores and although it said next_day delivery i opted for wednesday 0th_january .
2	waited in yesterday and by mid - morning was beginning to feel slightly uneasy especially as on the tracking it was still showing as being at the collection depot as at 0th_jan - googled xdp express and came_across this website and having read the reviews omg !
2	what have i done !!!
2	i emailed xdp at 00 . 00am asking them to confirm the mattress was being delivered on the 0th .
2	at 00 . 00pm i received an_email from xdp saying ' it wont_be out today , i have not received any freight for delivery today .
2	i will call you as soon as i receive the goods and arrange delivery with you '.
2	thats no good to me having taken a day off work especially for the delivery and unable to have any more time off ' til easter .
2	not going to mess around waiting in day after day like other people have done so emailed world_stores telling them i want to cancel the order and asking for a refund and also spoke to trading_standards just so i know my rights on cancelling the order - got automated email reply from world_stores and now awaiting an_email / phone_call from them which better be pretty soon .
2	knew i should have ordered from john_lewis in the first place .
2	if anyone from xdp express reads this , you really need to sort yourselves out , take_note how dhl , yodel , royal_mail and all the other delivery businesses work cos somewhere you ' re going badly wrong .
2	ordered from website with no_problems .
2	kept up to date by email from confirmation of order right up to delivery .
2	very good service .
2	delivery was arranged easily and everything was in order when delivered .
2	will be back again when i need a new_bathroom_suite .
2	easy to order off of website and delivery was very fast !
2	!
2	i lost 0 parcels which stated it was delivered to me .
2	i paid_extra to be delivered for a birthday_gift , the next_day .
2	never got the parcel ...!!
2	when i went on to the website , it tells_me i can not contact hermes , i must contact the company who send me the parcel .
2	when i contacted the company they showed me a strange signature , which does not belong to me or any of my family , and this is the second time .
2	how can that be .... why can '_t a parcel be traced .... was it delivered , or not .
2	how can they get away with things like that .
2	deliver to a strange person , and wash their hands of the whole situation .
2	i would share this review , but rather not ....
2	i am really so satisfied with the service .
2	every one will agree .
2	.. it is so nice to have a hassle_free topup .
2	i really love this company , everything i want and need .... i can get for £ 0 . 00 wow !!
2	!
2	it is such a treat ....!!!!!!!!!!!
2	!
2	well spoken , helpfull , professional
2	it was a very quick service and it was waiting for me when we came home though i thought i had to sign for as it came by the tracker post
2	they process my orders very quickly even my archie '_s prescription for his heart_condition .
2	they are so much_cheaper_than my vet .
2	i started looking on line when my niece told me to saying even the pdsa gets some from vets online and she should know as she works for them .
2	best exchange_rate i could find on the day and free delivery received with in 0_days !
2	great service !
2	a good friend recommended this company to me , years_ago as i was looking to upgrade one of my appliances .
2	i thought i '_d check it out .
2	after all , you can '_t get a better recommendation than a personal one .
2	ever_since that day , i '_ve never bought elsewhere !
2	" bought " being the important word here , because i always always check products in all other shops - high_street and online .
2	each time , without_fail , i '_ve always come_back to " buyers & sellers ".
2	they are terrific !
2	i bought from ruislip_appliances in 0000 when they were highly_recommended to me by a friend .
2	i was very impressed then and have used them very recently again .
2	needless to say , the level of service and ability to source the exact product i was after , was a smooth_operation from initial phonecall to finished and timely delivery .
2	i had a hiccup with one of the products but ruislip_appliances were patient , understanding and helpful throughout and helped_me sort the issue .
2	i would not_hesitate for a nano second to recommend ruislip_appliances to anyone !
2	thank_you for your wonderful products and for their speedy .. free delivery to my door !
2	i had not heard of your company before but when our grandaughter was approaching her magical 00th_birthday we asked for suggestions for a gift and you were put forward .

2	thank_you very much

2	thanks a buch sarah .
2	i '_m a fairly new customer of pet_supermarket , however if the services continues the way it has_been up until this point , i can '_t see me ever shopping for pet_food anywhere_else !
2	each time i have ordered , the delivery has always been super - quick , with excellent communication via emails and text .
2	the site is easy to use and my orders have always been smooth without problems .
2	i recommended the site to my daughter and now she uses it for ordering dog_food as well .
2	also , the price for the dog_food i buy is the cheapest i '_ve seen , so good value too !
2	all the products were as advertised the knife sharpner does exactly_what you want it to all my knifes are now sharp and it was easy to use the peeler is also great just right for me as i have small hands and it all came as promised super quick so would reccomend
2	pedsmeds always delivers on time and always good value would recommend them to all cat and dog_owners
2	avoid buying from this company at all costs .
2	their website offers next_day delivery - it took weeks and when the cartridges arrived they were useless .
2	you cannot get through on the phone to complain and when you email them it takes days for a reply which is a standard reply and they have no intentions of helping .
2	i returned a new cartridge which didn_'_t work and they have denied receiving it .
2	will never use them again .
2	poor in all departments .
2	i had issues with my domain_name , and was really pleased with the way my problem was handled .
2	the customer service person even took the trouble to phone me to ask if i needed any more help .
2	beyond the call of duty !
2	booked a " next_day delivery ", 00 paintings wrapped in 0 large parcels .
2	they were collected by a man in a plain_white van , who said he had no paperwork for anything for me to sign .
2	0 hours_later another citylink van arrived , and the second guy insisted i signed his console , even_though he didn_'_t collect the paintings .
2	it goes without saying that the paintings arrived 0_days late , meaning blank walls at the exhibition , and the cancellation of the opening .
2	i had travelled down myself for the opening , paying for 0 nights in a hotel plus travel .
2	as if that wasn_'_t bad enough , one parcel of ten painting is now " lost , and will not be found ".
2	the tracking showed it didn_'_t even make it to the depot in my town where it was collected , which means it is still on the first idiot '_s van .
2	or has fallen out of it , which isn_'_t surprising when i saw the way he squashed my valubale stuff into his manky old transit .
2	and trying to claim for this - they say the will do nothing , and the case is closed .
2	to make_matters even worse , the guy_who collected my stuff and basically must have taken it home for 0_days appeared at my door with an item i '_d ordered from amazon , and denied everything when questioned about my missing paintings .
2	it '_s bad enough when they lose items ( how does that even happen ?!)
2	but when they basically laugh at you for being so stupid as to trust them , it '_s beyond a joke .
2	the customer service is simply appalling .
2	i was very impressed with this company .
2	the price , and speed in which the product was delivered was brilliant !
2	will definitely use again !
2	thank_you .
2	great trip over in a very clean ship , with good food and drinks offered , shop for goods and to your destination in no time at all at your leisure !
2	after stepping on my older pair of ghd '_s thought it time to buy the new wide straghteners , there a awesome and cannot be without them on my frizzy long hair . they are the best and well_deserved gift to my self
2	great glasses and delivered to me in 00 days .
2	lovely quality and a bargain using my wowcher voucher .
2	this software is the best around for instant messenging with video and voice capability - fast and reliable for file sharing and the best is it '_s free for the basic service which works just as well as if you pay - there are lots of service available within skype once you join
2	well_worth a look - would recommend it to anyone
2	this is the 0st site i turn to when i need to shop online for gifts - the site is very user_friendly and i can always find what i need 0st time round with plenty of payment options as well
2	i love this company because i can build up points just by reading their emails
2	the choice of products that you can purchase with points is excellent with plenty of gifts to choose from
2	first time customer very happy
2	items were realistically_priced , received quickly and as_described .
2	i am happy with my first order and would consider_using viovet again
2	very helpful and many_thanks
2	a great service , i ordered at lunch_time one day and it arrived the next_day .
2	i ordered my item on the 00 december and as it said 0 / 0 day delivery and it was in stock i thought it would have arrived before christmas , it did not arrive so i emailed them twice , i must_admit i did receive one email back , but not very helpful i kept looking to see if it had been dispatched , but no it kept saying awaiting dispatch , although the money had been taken from my account on the day ordered as other people have already said .
2	i have just phoned them and was told they did not have time to send before christmas and will be sending in a couple of days , although i will not be holding my breath on that one .
2	i wish i had seen this site before i ordered as i would never had placed an order . be warned do not touch this website with a barge_pole they can not fulfill their promises and are a complete_waste of time and money .
2	excellent range of products and excellent service .
2	website is really easy to navigate and prices very competitive .
2	wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend them

2	i have been contacted 00 times in 0_days by this company .
2	i have never been a customer and they are trying to make me upgrade my phone with them .
2	i purchased something over 0yrs_ago from them not a phone and i certainly didnt give them my phone number i am registered with tps , so why are they harassing me .................. never in a million years would i buy even a earphone from them now
2	awful pushy and not prepared to do anything about my complaint the sooner this company goes out of business the better !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2	!
2	it was a pleasure_doing_business with this company , easy ordering and so fast too .
2	goods arrived within_00hrs of placing the order .

2	never had the slightest problem .
2	quick delivery , efficient , friendly service .
2	what more could i ask ?
2	really competitive_prices and incredibly fast and efficient delivery .
2	they even refunded some of the postage when they managed to squeeze all of my order into one box .
2	stephen_wiltshire is just amazing .
2	his photographic memory leaves me in awe !
2	love his toronto & london pictures best cos love toronto & london best !
2	just have a look - i defy you not to be impressed with his talent .
2	second time i have ordered from serenata , arrived on time and lasted_longer_than any other others i have ordered from in the past
2	the service for the item i purchased was quick but it was not suitable for my needs .
2	they agreed i could return it without_question and my credit was issued by return .
2	would definitely use them again .
2	i have now purchased a headset and a trio phone system from onedirect and the service is second to none .
2	the customer_care both prior to purchase and after could not be better and any technical_issues i had were dealt_with immediately and patiently .
2	i am not the most technical of people so it was nice to talk to someone_who was so helpful .
2	i called today for some advise on how to set_up my sagepay security .
2	jonny sands was a great help not only walking me through the process , but assisting with other aspects of our application and procedures , contacting other departments to ensure he was providing me with accurate information .
2	a pleasure to deal with and most helpful with follow_up information and contact details for any future queries .
2	order a pair of barbour wellington_boots - excellent service as usual , items arrived in a couple of days .
2	well pleased with this company
2	have purchased two barbour_jackets within the last couple of months .

2	this is my first order with net pet shop and it won_'_t be my last , very quick delivery , competitive_prices .... don_'_t need anything_else out of an online shop really .
2	thank_you .
2	in brief ....
2	i have my refund !
2	woohoo !
2	.
2	date of order : 00st_july_0000
2	date of lens received back by se : 00th_august_0000
2	date of refund into my bank : 00st_september_0000
2	so , it has taken almost 0_weeks from the time they received the lens back to the time of my refund back into the bank .
2	00 emails , 0 phone_calls ( i gave up phoning because they can only stick to the script , not actually help at all ).
2	nice little_earner for this company , if they keep people '_s money for this long , they are getting the interest .
2	if you have ordered from them and your item has arrived safe and sound that '_s great , well_done ........ just check that it isn_'_t a counterfeit item and pray to your higher being that you never have to return it because it '_s faulty .
2	never as long as i have to breathe air to live , will i deal with this company and it '_s incompetent , robotic staff again .
2	i have bought a bedroom_suite for my 00 year_old daughter , a wardrobe last christmas , chest of drawers and bedside_cabinet for her_birthday and finally the bed for this christmas .
2	every item has_been delivered as and when stated .
2	the furniture is good quality and reasonably_priced it is also easy to put_together , my daughter_loves her bedroom and i am really impressed that it has all been done without me having
2	to leave the comfort of my own_home .
2	made the mistake of buying a shower_tray from them .
2	was needed urgently , was promised delivery next week .
2	arrived 0_months later .
2	in the meantime countless_emails , messages left and not replied to , delivery dates given but not adhered to , on one historic date pre and after sales sent 0 conflicting delivery dates - of course it did not arrive on either date .
2	what you might save money wise originally you will lose on the project delays , having to get people back on site .
2	we were lucky in that we ordered only one item , if you bought several things from them it could take you months to get the entire order .
2	they are either completely disorganised or completely dishonest .
2	their manager to whom everything is referred to for action , never rings back , hides behind the telephonist .
2	they caused us a huge_amount of stress , and delayed our project so much that it delayed our house_move as well .
2	have now had 0 couriers accept my delivery - one cancelled as they had underquoted - still_waiting refund on deposit - second one cancelled on day of collection no reason given .
2	while i may get a refund of both deposits , it is simply a credit_note to be reused on shiply , not my money back .
2	this is patently unfair - i didn_'_t cancel these jobs , just the cowboy couriers who were due to collect !
2	shiply take the money and run the website but walk_away from the problems and leave it up to you to sort it out .
2	this is the response from the advertising_standards authority who just walk_away like shiply - if you use shiply ever read every item on the website and be aware that the cowboy couriers who use their site can cancel your job at any time , walk_away , and it costs them nothing but it costs you bigtime .
2	thank_you for contacting the advertising_standards authority .
2	i understand you raised concerns that shiply . com was misleading because it was not clear from the front pages that shiply ’_s fee will be returned to a user ’_s account as time - limited credit if a job is cancelled .
2	we can intervene if an advertisement seems likely to be in breach of the uk code of non - broadcast advertising by , among other things , being likely to provoke serious or widespread offence , risking causing significant harm or being materially misleading .
2	we have assessed the case however we consider it unlikely such a breach has occurred in this instance .
2	we noted that the full user agreement is available from every page on the website and also from the “ user faq ” section as part of the “ payment & service ” questions .
2	we noted that in section six of the user agreement the advertiser makes clear that they charge a fee for their part if setting_up the service and that if a job is cancelled the fee is returned as credit which must be used within six_months .
2	given that customers have to utilise the service online and the user agreement is available on the website , we do not consider it likely consumers will be mislead for the reason suggested .
2	cette_fois la_livraison était trop vite .

2	have recommended this company to numerous folks .
2	i have to say i was a bit_apprehensive despite having read all the excellent reviews , with a much_cheaper price than here in the uk , it just seemed too good to be true .
2	my order could not have arrived quicker if i '_d ordered from a uk store , fantastic service from dhl with complete tracking and friendly assistance .
2	no_problems_whatsoever .

2	very pleased with them and the company , will not_hesitate to use them again and highly_recommend them .
2	i have bought quite a few things from everything 0 pounds and i have never been disappointed .
2	i '_ve_used animed_direct for some time now and have always been extremely pleased with the service .
2	prices are very good and orders are despatched very quickly .
2	i have ordered several products from supplement_warehouse . com and have not been disappointed .
2	items arrive in a timely_manner , no mix - up in my orders .
2	great service .
2	i had a full lens replacement in both eyes allowing my vision to be improved greatly from the blurriness i had before .
2	i am now a year down the line and all has healed and settled allowing me the freedom of clear vision , day and night , without being burdened with glasses .
2	i would recommend this treatment and the optical_express team to all of my friends and family without_hesitation especially as they now work out of nottingham .. wow , local too ..
2	perfect service , efficient and fast delivery .
2	remote_control is a good replacement for my original which broke and the website made it easy to choose the right replacement .
2	i thought having the groceries delivered to the door would be great as i work full time and my time off is precious .
2	the delivery was prompt and the delivery man very polite , problem was that the fresh items delivered had one or two day shelf_life , many items where looking past the shelf_life .
2	i contacted when i at first_glance saw items that had perished who where extremely apologetic and sent me an e_- voucher to compensate me .
2	but as the next couple of days unravelled i found more items with same day delivery shelf_life .
2	this experience has put me off getting my groceries delivered .
2	i am a new customer and found the ordering easy .
2	i had the items delivered to my local_spar as i work full - time , the delivery was prompt , on arrival unpacked and tried on items purchased which unfortunately was to big , i rand customer_services and spoke to hannah who was extremely_helpful .
2	i re - ordered the items puchased in smaller_size but only one item was available in the size i required .
2	i returned my items to the spar on my way to work the next_morning and the following_day my replacement order arrived at the spar .
2	item where of good quality and packaged very well .
2	all was very easy as no having to wait in for delivery .
2	i was very pleased with my order and the speed in which it came , as i always am .
2	can '_t knock you superdry , keep_up the good work !
2	!
2	always use double0tickets .
2	have always arrived in plenty of time for event .
2	although a bit more_expensive than some they are always genuine tickets so good value in the long run .
2	apart_from ticketmaster i have only once used another company only to find they are fake tickets on the night , so well_worth_paying a little extra for .
2	i would recommend double0 to anybody without the slightest reservation !!
2	keep_up the good work .
2	oh and the script were excellent !!!!
2	:_d
2	absolute fantastic service , always helpful and made to feel_welcome by all the staff would not use anywhere_else been using them for years and always satisfied with the service , would reccommend them to everyone .
2	delivery was made the exact day it should be and am happy with the manner of service they provided .
2	excellent .
2	thank_you arbico !
2	my last experience of buying a new pc was so horrific that i postponed acquiring a new one as long as i could .
2	finally i had to change my mind and started some intense research to find my “ dream machine ”.
2	no one seemed to produce what i wanted so i finally_settled on arbico who would produce a custom design for me .
2	i emailed them on a sunday giving my keywords , spec .
2	and budget .
2	lunchtime on monday i got a detailed reply .
2	taking overnight to think on it i phoned arbico on the tuesday and after a detailed conversation with the designer settled on an , ( upgraded ), design .
2	on thursday , the next week , i received an_email to say my pc system was on its way .
2	it duly_arrived on friday and the unpacking took_ages as it was so well cocooned .
2	i put the system together - everything worked first time .
2	it was brilliant , just what i wanted ,…. and so fast !
2	a real rolls - royce of a computer .
2	i cannot recommend arbico too highly .

2	i have been shopping with kays / great universal for at_least 00 years .
2	the quality of products is really good , from when my children were little til now when i just buy products for myself .
2	in years past when everything was done over the phone , the staff were always friendly and helpful ., even now wehn i have to call them they are still there to help .... now using the internet do do everything it '_s easier still .
2	prompt delivery and informed at all times to any delays that may occur .
2	the payment_methods always helped too when i had my young family .
2	and still helps now to spread the cost !!

2	i just love to look , order , try ... with the 00 day approval ... brilliant .

2	i purchased two items from home base , and found ordering the items on line very easy indeed , it is a secure website , so you can be confident it is safe to use
2	i ordered two vertical_blinds from blinds 0 go .
2	they wanted the exact_measurements of the opening and they would knock off the relevant clearance for them to fit .
2	they were perfect when installed .
2	excellent company , would highly_recommend this company .
2	also the product was first_class .
2	the cordless_vacuum_cleaner is fantastic , it do , es exactly_what it states on your website .
2	minus_point , it , s a bit_noisy , but still a brilliant buy
2	do not touch this company with a barge_pole , the after sales_team are a joke .
2	i have e_mailed them twice and got no response , it states it could take up to two working_days to reply to e_mails ( why ) .
2	if no response within two_days phone them , what a waste of time and money , a could , nt run a pxxs up in a brewery springs to mind .
2	they owe me approx_£_000 from a cancelled order , and i , m finding it extremely difficult to get reimbursed , it is looking like i am going to have to take them to the small claim court to retrieve my money .
2	be warned stay well clear of this company , it , s like something out of fred karnos circus .

2	i bought a double premium outlast 000 m - f mattress for our bed and a small double price buster 000 for my son '_s , after our daughter got a memory_foam_mattress a few_months_ago .
2	my son '_s is quite firm , and he says he '_s very happy with it and getting a good night '_s sleep .
2	i would quite happily spend all my time in bed now on my new mattress .
2	it is insanely comfortable .
2	you don_'_t get creaking when anyone turns over in bed , and no roll - together either ( yay !).
2	my husband finds he gets a bit hot during the night , but i '_m just right , and as the cold_weather is approaching it won_'_t be a problem for him much longer .
2	i used to get up with an aching back , but now i '_m sleeping like a baby .

2	thankyou so much for the 0 poster taper bed .

2	i bought a samsung laser_printer and inks .
2	the parcels came as previously announced in perfect_condition .
2	reasonable priced , great experience , would recommend it to friends and family .
2	there '_s only one thing , it should say on the site that the printer is sold with sample ink_cartridges .
2	thinking it was empty , i bought the cartridges with it .
2	which drove the price up quite high .
2	doesn_'_t matter , i will use them anyway .
2	thanks
2	d .

2	even better_than we could have hoped .
2	the definition is very clear and sharp and the colours are very vivid .
2	it is now hanging in our lounge and everyone who has visited has_commented on it .
2	we ' re searching through our photos to find more photos suitable for making into canvas wall - hangings , and deciding where we can put them .
2	many_thanks too for the super - fast delivery and excellent packaging .
2	it arrived intact and was on the wall within minutes .
2	i have used amazon extensively , have never had any_problems with delivery or return .

2	i have used this company before and all my party_themes have had that added extra that little extra touch .
2	the nice thing is that the cost is very reasonable and delivery is very good .
2	so if you want a party what ever the occasion try partyrama first .
2	i placed an order with interparcel for a package to be sent to spain on 0th_december and the parcel was duly collected by a dpd courier the following_day .
2	i tracked the parcel online and saw that it was out for delivery on the 00th , then again on the 00th and finally a message was posted at 0pm on the 00th stating there was a query with the address .
2	on monday_00rd after noticing this comment , i called at 0 . 00am and confirmed that the address details were correct and confirmed the recipients contact number , which was missing the last digit .
2	on the 00th , when there was no further update on the tracking_system and the parcel still had not been received , i attempted to call interparcel again ( their website stated they were open till midday ) and just continuously got an answer machine message_saying the office would reopen after the august bank_holiday (??).
2	in desperation i called dpd direct and after 0 attempts finally spoke with someone with whom i confirmed the address and contact number again and was guaranteed the recipient would be called and delivery would be arranged .
2	on the 00th , the tracking_system was once again updated stating that they were unable to deliver the parcel ( but having contacted the recipient i knew for a fact that they hadn_'_t yet called her or attempted a delivery !)
2	i tried to call them on the 00st and the 0st to find out what was going on , but both_times i just got an answer machine message .
2	on the 0nd i finally got through to be told that the parcel was being returned to me because i hadn_'_t confirmed the telephone_number in time for them to contact the recipient .
2	as this was blatantly untrue , and i had the telephone records to prove it , i quite understandably was not amused , but had no choice but to accept that the parcel was now on its way back to me .
2	on the 0rd , the tracking_system showed that it had been received in birmingham .
2	when i hadn_'_t received it by the 00th , i contacted both dpd and interparcel who confirmed that it was now at interparcels depot in crawley ( having passed my house in the process !)
2	and it would be with me on monday 00th .
2	on tuesday 00th , when it still hadn_'_t been received , i called and have been promised it will be with me on thursday 00th .
2	so i wait with baited breath !!
2	!
2	and to add_insult to injury , after having to endure such poor service and incompetent customer support , i have been told that i will not receive a refund for the original cost of the service !
2	i needed to get 0 parcels to london by a definite date in early_december and chose to use collect_+ as the recipient was at work all day and it was far more convenient for him to pick the parcels up at a local shop after work than it was to try to get to the post_office during the opening_hours .
2	i dropped the parcels at my local collect_+ shop and they scanned without a problem .
2	using online tracking i could see that the parcels were picked_up the following_day and the recipient received a txt notifying him that the parcels were on their way .
2	00hrs_later when the parcels hadn_'_t been received and the tracking status hadn_'_t changed i called connect_+ and was told there was a problem scanning one of the parcels , but that they were at the depot and would be delivered within 00_hrs .
2	00hrs came and went and as the recipient had now gone on holiday for 0_weeks , i called collect_+ and i asked for the parcels to be returned to me and asked for a refund of the shipping_costs i had already paid .
2	i was told that i could have a credit towards a future order .
2	obviously i had no_intention of ever using connect_+ again so i said that wasn_'_t acceptable .
2	after keeping_me on hold for 0 mins they then told me i could make a claim for a refund and send me a claim_form .
2	i waited another 0_days for the parcels to be returned to me , but still didn_'_t receive anything .
2	finally , i called connect_+ again and this time was told that my parcels had gone_missing and couldn_'_t be found at the depot and was emailed another 0 claim forms .
2	when i said i would rather wait for the parcels to be located even if it took longer , i was told it was highly unlikely they would turn_up as they had probably been stolen !
2	!
2	the whole_process was unprofessional , badly managed and a complete_waste of my time and money .
2	the level of compensation is in no way adequate to cover the value of the contents or their replacement .
2	i will never use this service again and after_reading the many reviews on this site , wish i had never used them in the first place .
2	description was spot_on , the ordering process was simple and the items arrived within_00hrs !
2	how much_easier can it be .......
2	this tourmaline point pendant is absolutely_gorgeous .
2	it feels substantial and is very well made .
2	i bought it as a present for my husband and he is delighted with it .
2	its a great price and well_worth the money .
2	i ordered this late on a thursday and it was here the next_day .
2	fantastic service .
2	will definitely use again and would recommend this company .
2	the veloped tour is the rolls_royce of rollators ( infact it isn_'_t correct to call it a rollator - its so much more )
2	i thought long and hard about making this purchase as it isn_'_t cheap but am so glad that i decided to buy it .
2	for someone like me who has mobility_issues , it is a godsend .
2	it is sturdy yet light to push and the seat is very comfortable .
2	the basket holds loads making it a joy to go shopping with .
2	it performs brilliantly in shops and off road and avoids the juddering sensation you get on uneven surfaces with a traditional rollator .
2	it folds and fits into the back of my meriva and i wouldn_'_t go_anywhere without it now .
2	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend the veloped and the company who invented it .
2	stefan is so helpful and gave_me the opportunity to try it out for a day and to return it free if i wasn_'_t happy with it .
2	excellent service and wonderful product !
2	i am so impressed with the customer service from zooplus .
2	i had ordered the wrong item and they dealt_with it swifly and refunded my money without quibble .
2	the customer service team were fantastic and this is a company i would have no_hesitation in recommending .
2	prices are great and they have a fabulous range of products at excellent prices .
2	great value for money and courtesy too .
2	always easy to contact and dealt_with quickly and efficiently !
2	i bought two flower making kits for my twin great nieces who will br 0 in a few_months so cannot open them to look in detail but i am positive they will love them
2	i bought a washing_machine recently and was very impressed with my dealings with ao . com .
2	very professional , offer very competitive_prices and speedy delivery dates !
2	i was kept up to date all along , whether it was by e_- mail to confirm my order , text on the day of delivery to confirm my delivery timeslot or phone_calls from the delivery driver to give me a more exact time of arrival .
2	would definitely use again .
2	i had no_problems of any kind , and everything has_gone correctly , good service .
2	thanks
2	my order arrived 00_hours after ordering it .
2	it was nicely_packed and presented , and the standard of the product was outstanding .

2	found on - line the microwave i wanted at a super price and free delivery , ordered item , delivered in two day '_s , kept me informed as the where and when my item would be delivered , amazing .
2	highly_recommended in my opinion , will be returning to buy other items for my new_kitchen extention .
2	first time user , ordered an item i thought was near to me about 0 miles_away , turned_out it was over_£_000_miles_away , had previously asked a local courier to collect from 0miles away , before i knew my mistake , luckily i saw shiply and for the same price the courier delivered my item from 000_miles_away , i know it is because it fills a van load , never the less i am impressed and will definitely use in future .
2	excellent service .
2	i ordered my first crystal and it arrived with a small mistake so i was given a small discount to order another which i did .
2	this time the mistake was worse and being a christmas_present i was told a replacement would arrive for christmas_eve .......
2	it did arrive with the correct wording but the wrong photo on .
2	i asked for a refund and after_speaking to ' james ' on reception 00 times for a call back and they never call you back .
2	i have spent so much time emailing & telephoning only to receive an_email_saying they think they sent a cheque out to me .
2	....... well they haven ; t
2	i would never recommend this company and would never use again .
2	i will take this further if i do not receive my payment via_paypal today , hope this review helps get a response or my money back

2	i explained we needed it a week before the date of our_wedding ( the date they were printing on the bottles ) and the chap was so reassuring i actually topped_up the order with some rose wine .
2	when they hadn_'_t arrived by the day before we were setting off to our_wedding destination i rang again i was told , really curtly , they '_d be with us in three_days .
2	i said that would be too late and was told in the rudest manner they would be delivered the next_day .
2	we delayed our departure to wait for them but they never arrived that day .
2	apparently they arrived two_days_later .
2	most of the reviewers on here seem to have had a much_better experience , perhaps ours was just an unfortunate isolated case , but i wouldn_'_t risk ordering from them again particularly as the last man i spoke to was so rude to me .
2	wonderful high_quality chocolate with the variety i needed .
2	nice to be able to get everything from one site .
2	really pleased , the item was exactly as_described and super speedy delivery .
2	i purchased madonna tickets on line from double 0 for her aviva dublin gig on 00 / 00 / 00
2	i later went back on line this time going through a search_engine for double 0 tickets itself , clicked on the reviews to discover that they had been listed on the b . b . c watchdog site as a company to avoid , my heart_sank as at this stage i had purchased 0 tickets for 000_euro . i rang ( 00000000000 ) the company the next_day to find out more & was ressured that they were affiliated to a registered company ( forgive me i can longer remember the exact name but all their info checked out which can easily be checked on line ). thankfully this is a genuine site & tickets did arrive in plenty of time for a really wild performance , so rest_assured they do what they say , i would use them again in a heartbeat .
2	once again digital_rev '_s service has_been brilliant .
2	i ordered from the uk on monday_afternoon and my lens arrived on wednesday_morning .
2	i was able to track my package every_step of the way .
2	so far the canon 00 - 000 lens has not disappointed !
2	a very user_friendly site backed by a vast_amount of comprehensive information , so clearly expressed it should qualify for a ' plain_english ' award .
2	there are very few sites about which i would be tempted to say that !
2	these guy s have a professional looking website but beware - after paying £_00 and waiting a few_days i was told they have entered into a contract with the network and demand a further £_000 from you otherwise they will not unlock your phone or will blacklist yours if you don_'_t pay up .
2	this is not an accusation - this is what they did to me .
2	fact
2	beware
2	do no use
2	historically i have had a lot of problems with parcel couriers - and yodel has_been no exception .
2	i live in a very remote property , way off the beaten_track and the road to the property is rough .
2	many parcel couriers simply can '_t be bothered to make the extra effort that is required to get here .
2	however , over the past couple of years i have been pleasantly_surprised by yodel .
2	their drivers have turned_up on time , been friendly and helpful , and taken_care to leave the parcels in a sensible place in my absence .
2	well_done yodel - you have restored my faith in parcel couriers :)
2	i have had some very bad_experiences of parcel couriers but ukmail have restored my faith .
2	my stuff always turns_up promptly and the driver is a really nice friendly and helpful guy .
2	i wish all couriers could be this efficient ...
2	why would anyone want to go to an actual shop when you can get stuff delivered this fast !
2	!
2	this was the first order that i '_d placed with country_house_outdoor so i wasn_'_t really sure what to expect but i can only say that the service was excellent .
2	the goods were very well_packaged and delivered extremely quickly .
2	i certainly wouldn_'_t_hesitate to buy from them again .
2	one of my sphynx cats recently became_ill and required specialist veterinary treatment at a referral hospital .
2	the treatment was both complex and costly but petplan settled each claim promptly and without_question .
2	i cannot_fault their service .
2	on the one occasion that i needed to query something about my policy the customer service guy was extremely polite , friendly and helpful .
2	i cannot recommend them highly_enough .
2	can '_t fault the service .
2	everything turned_up really quickly and in perfect_condition thanks to good quality packaging .
2	products are effective and competitively_priced .
2	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to shop with these_guys again ....
2	i ordered a number of feline ' prescription ' dietary feeds from pet_supermarket as their prices were far more reasonable than those charged by vets .
2	i was delighted to find all the products i wanted and everything turned_up really quickly .
2	a great service - i will definitely use them again .
2	this is the place to go if you want any kind of poultry supplies .
2	they have a huge_range of goods , a nice easy to use website , and the service is second to none .
2	my goods were despatched promptly and were well_packaged .
2	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend this company .
2	i '_ve placed several orders with this company and have never been disappointed with the service .
2	goods are despatched promptly and well_packaged and everything arrives in perfect_condition .
2	their range of products is second to none and i have no_hesitation in recommending them .
2	i have been ordering from ocado for almost 0 years_now and have only ever received 0 deliveries late .
2	in stark contrast to tesco ( whom i shopped with for several_years previously ) they are reliable , goods are rarely unavailable , substitutions ( if any ) are appropriate , and any damaged or missing items are refunded promptly and without_question .
2	the quality is generally excellent too .
2	very occasionally some fresh_fruit or vegetable items may not be totally perfect but in my opinion , if i am going to save myself heaps of time and effort by entrusting a third_party with my shopping then i am happy to accept that .
2	if items are seriously damaged or unusable then i can easily get a refund - where '_s the problem with that ?
2	well_done ocado !
2	i must_confess that i have only just started receiving these boxes of snacks but i must_say i am already seriously impressed .
2	the boxes are very well_presented and i love the personalised touches .
2	ok , the boxes aren_'_t huge but these are meant to be ' nibble ' boxes and they are exactly that .
2	a huge choice of products , very simple to prevent certain products being sent , and the stuff is truly delicious .
2	i hope to be receiving these boxes for a very long time ....
2	i have placed several orders with pharmacy0u over the past couple of years and have never been disappointed .
2	items are despatched quickly - even out of stock items turn_up quicker_than_expected .
2	an excellent range of products , outstanding service , i really can '_t fault them ...
2	can '_t fault the service .
2	i ordered a set of phones on wednesday_lunchtime , they arrived the following lunchtime .
2	not only were my goods despatched quickly but i was also kept constantly_updated with delivery details and so knew_exactly when my parcel would arrive .
2	i normally order telephones directly from bt but after this experience i would certainly check out this company first ...
2	these_guys are really efficient , have a great choice of products , and their prices are very competitive .
2	i '_ve bought from them several_times_now and have never been disappointed with the service .
2	i have bought quite a lot of items from these_guys over the years - mobile_phones , numerous accessories - and have never_failed to be impressed with their speed and efficiency .
2	outstanding range of products , fast delivery , superb communication ( text_messages and emails_detailing progress of ordered items ) - i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend them :)
2	i ordered 0 pairs of crocs online a couple of weeks_ago and was delighted to receive an_email which stated that they had been despatched .
2	tracking_information was provided and i waited_patiently for my goods to arrive .
2	crocs use hdnl to deliver and , predictably , my parcel failed to arrive .
2	i emailed crocs customer service and asked them to look into this .
2	they eventually replied and said they would ensure prompt delivery .
2	when my goods still failed to arrive i emailed customer service again , and again , and again - on an almost daily_basis - but received no further reply .
2	i suggested that they either send replacement goods via a different courier or else refund my money - still no reply .
2	i still have not received my goods and no refund has_been offered so i have been forced to open a paypal_dispute in an attempt to get my money back .
2	needless to say i will not be shopping there again ....
2	excellent service all_round .
2	goods are despatched promptly and are great value .
2	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to buy from dapw again .
2	never before have i come_across such an inept organisation ...
2	the tracking_information for my goods - which have still not turned_up - is a complete_joke and utterly meaningless .
2	for 0_days there was ' no access to property ', the parcel was then ' delivered to customer ' on 0 consecutive_days , then loaded_onto the van again only to be returned to the depot as ' no access to property ' yet again .
2	customer_services cannot / will not discuss the matter with me and what '_s more i am charged a lot of money for a wasted phone_call .
2	clearly hdnl have no desire or intention of delivering parcels and should be avoided at all cost ...
2	having placed my order , for a hard to find item at a seriously low price , i was expecting to be disappointed .
2	however the item arrived well_packaged , very quickly and the quality was excellent .
2	u are excellent people
2	my husband and i were looking for a joint present from each other , to each other .
2	we '_d be toying with the idea of getting a limited_edition print and , having loved stephen '_s work for many_years , set off for the gallery .
2	with expert guidance from annette we quickly settled on our favourite and then came the task of choosing the mount and frame .
2	we knew what we wanted and where we wanted to the print to hang at home .
2	annette provided us with a whole range of mounts to choose from , patiently trying one combination and then another .
2	we settled on the mount fairly quickly but just couldn_'_t agree on the frame - we wanted gold but not in the widths or finish available .
2	not a problem for annette ; she contacted their framer who was able to provide us with a bespoke frame , meeting exactly_what we needed .
2	we couldn_'_t have been more impressed with the care and attention paid to us .
2	we now have the print hanging in our front room and smile whenever we look at it .
2	fast efficient service with a smile .
2	i had booked my car tyres to be fitted on a saturday but my circumstances had changed enabling_me to have them fitted a day earlier .
2	i rang my local f0_autocentre to see if this was possible - it was , my tyres were fitted within one hour of me placing my call to them .
2	how wonderful , will use them again , excellent price tyres .
2	first_class service would highly_recommend to everyone .
2	when placing my order it stated 0 - 00 days delivery - received within 0_days unfortunately i was not available to receivce my goods .
2	asif in customer_services helped_me with rearranging my delivery , nothing was too much_trouble for him .
2	excellent customer service skills .
2	very happy with my goods will use again .
2	we ordered 0 items from the columbia sale and are highly delighted with them .
2	having_researched this site and read the reviews we knew_exactly_what to expect , and were delighted when our products arrived well on time .
2	my " shimmer - me " jacket is really nice and was over 00_% cheaper_than r . r . p .
2	my husband ordered 0 fleeces and they are excellent quality at a very good price .
2	we will definitely be using this company again and would highly_recommend them .
2	thank_you , sports pursuit !
2	sorted things so easy
2	thank_you
2	i have only sampled three of the items i bought in my first order from westin_gourmet so far but they all met with resounding success .
2	i cooked the meaty_pork_sausages when my friend came to dinner , ( she '_s a confirmed sausageaholic btw but will only eat the best .
2	no walls for her !)
2	we were both very taken with them , the flavour is perfect , just like the old_fashioned sausages i remember when we had our own pigs , the texture is beautiful too .
2	next i tried the aberdeen_angus sirloin_steak on another friend and we both found them tender , juicy and very tasty , i did suggest that they could have been cut a little thicker for perfection and was assured that in the near_future we '_ll be able to choose the thickness of steaks when ordering .
2	that will assure total perfection as far as i can see .
2	lastly , i had some of the sliced cooked ham for lunch yesterday and found that to be really tasty and tender , so much_nicer_than the stuff you get at the supermarket .
2	to sum up ...... westin_gourmet , i love you !
2	ordered my billy oh summerhouse and was slightly dismayed by delay in delivery but since it was over easter i sort of let it pass .
2	eventually delivered and ( as delivery note states ) tried to check it was all there .. driver was very helpful and done it for me .. even pointing_out the support strutts when i questioned where they were .
2	on opening it all up discovered the floor was 00 inches too small from one that i had ordered as an extra , and so called support strutts were actually the door frame .
2	phoned the company and they promised to send out new floor and support strutts as soon as possible but would not offer a refund due it being stated that delivery items should be checked .. anyway .. 0_weeks_later .. been told twice that it is their hub but dates given were different .. customer service appalling and basically pawn you off ... would never order a single item again from this company and if new floor and strutts are not here by wednesday they can come and collect the whole bloody lot !
2	at my wits_end .. and suspicious now ... really bad show .. have so far warned two people off from buying from this company .. and will_continue to do so
2	really happy with mazumamobile . com !
2	transaction was quick and hassle_free .
2	will certainly use again !
2	a friend told me about shiply so i thought i '_d give them a go .
2	i was more than pleased with the whole_process from_start to finish .
2	i didn_'_t want to hire a van and do it myself , so i got in touch with shiply and within a few_days my bed was picked_up and delivered for a very reasonable_price .
2	wow !
2	i have been searching_everywhere for a company this great !
2	low_prices and great service .

2	i have used booking . com for our 0month travel in europe and have found the places generally to be of extremely high_standard and the service very useful .
2	would not_hesitate to recommend this company to everyone
2	my husband was mowing the lawn one day , when he noticed the flex was frayed .
2	we went straight_away to b_& q but couldn_'_t get a replacement .
2	i got on line typed the name , and up came ' espares '.
2	i found the flex , paid by paypal , and it was delivered the next_morning !
2	quicker_than hunting_around !

2	the clarity of the photos on photo cards is fantastic , and it '_s so easy to do with my ipad .
2	arrived at manchester with hand baggage for a silver_wedding celebration with family who live in murcia .
2	we went straight through security , the gate was already open , and within 00_mins we were on the aircraft .
2	couldn_'_t_believe the leg_room we had .
2	the plane was clean , bright and airy . the staff were so friendly , and the flight arrived early .
2	we went straight through security at murcia in 00_mins we were in my brothers car on our way to a beach bar .
2	returning was exactly the same no stress , no_hassle experience .
2	loved it .
2	can not stop telling_everyone about it .
2	after the last two experiences with monarch which were nightmares , and still no explanation or apology , these flights with jet0 were like a breath of fresh_air .
2	just hope the next ones are the same !
2	i will not be going with monarch again that '_s for sure !
2	excellent service as always
2	from the 0st phone_call until delivery
2	delivered promptly

2	this will be my 0th shipment of this item and i have never received a broken bottle .
2	thanks !.
2	i have used my hermes for my ebay selling as they are much_cheaper_than royal_mail - however they have become increasingly unreliable .
2	i have had parcels sent to the wrong depot so they take twice as long to deliver , i '_ve lost_count of the number of smashed items - and because of their ever growing lsit of items they don_'_t cover for compensation - find myself out of pocket .
2	i '_ve had instances where they claim to ahve obtained a customer signature only to later discover the item was left elsewhere but no card left for my customer to let them know .
2	i ship well over two hundred parcels a month & my hermes will now be losing my business as i can '_t afford to use them anymore they are useless !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2	!
2	code was promised in 0 to 00_hours .
2	0_days_later no code and no response to emails .
2	i '_ve requested refund but no response .
2	they even have the cheek to make you pay through paypal and then add their paypal fees onto your charges .
2	total ripoff merchants
2	joined_topcashback about two years_ago and have earned_over_£_000 just by clicking_through the site and shopping in my usual shops .
2	you have to join it `_s free to all and free cashback .
2	superb a must for all crafty shoppers who love a bargain and topcashback is a great british bargain
2	be careful !
2	unfortunally , the last orderi received , many products were expired 0 years_ago , when i called they knew it . read the labels please !
2	i had only wished i had seen this iflowers rating site before purchasing .
2	i have now noted the endless adverse comments of other totally disappointed purchasers like myself who ordered flowers and chocolates for valentines_day to be delivered at a convalescent home where my wife was staying on valentines .
2	what was supposed to be a nice_surprise and cheer_her up during her recovery has had turned_out to be a total disaster as she had assumed i had forgotten i had to forward her the emails to confirm that i had placed the emails on the saturday .
2	needless to say like everyonelse i tried_calling them directly yesterday but just a message_confirming no - one was available at around 0 . 00pm when they state they are open until 0 , 00pm .
2	i completed an on line complaint form confirming i wanted an_immediate full_refund and todate have heard_nothing so will be escalating this to trading_standards on monday

2	ordered tumble_dryer from this company . very pleased with the dryer at this amazingly_low price . i had emails to tell me when to expect delivery , also phoned with a query , phone was answered instantly , a very pleasant lady gave_me the info i needed .

2	with a long fence to be replaced we opted for a fence from waltons and are very pleased with our choice as both the quality of the panels and their customer service seem to well exceed our expectations .
2	i hope we will not have to be replacing it again for a good few_years but when we do - or if we have anything_else they can provide - we will be right back !
2	thanks waltons !
2	my order came when they said and was the high_quality , sensibly_packed product i have grown to expect - thanks for the first_class service - again !

2	i ordered a dark solid mango console_table , so beautiful and well made .

2	medicanimal provides my cats with a fast and cheaper service than_anywhere_else on the www - the prices are always better_than other_suppliers and i never have to wait to receive the royal_canin biscuit .
2	easy to find , order and as always_arrives in good time to ensure my cats do not go without their much loved food .
2	i ordered items at half and sometimes a quarter of the price i can buy elsewhere - i met the free delivery and sure enough within a couple of hours i was advised of dispatch .
2	the items arrived this morning , all present and correct and adequately wrapped where necessary .
2	i will obviously use chemist_direct in future , especially for mouthwash - listerine citrus difficult to find and overly priced elsewhere , was purchased in bulk because it was just so affordable .
2	thanks cd .
2	i have not used this company before and i have been extremely pleased with their response to my order - checking and verifying details and posting off my cat louis '_s medication almost_immediately - it is refreshing to have such contact with an online company who like to ensure their customer '_s pets get the very best treatment .

2	many_thanks serenata , we will be using you again .
2	i originally bought a pirate jacket but when it arrived & i realised how good the quality of it was i had no_hesitation in then ordering the pirate blouse to go with it & also a sword .
2	unfortunately the sword had broken in transit but all it took was one email to customer_services & a replacement sword arrived very securely_packaged a matter of a few_days_later with email_updates on the run up to my receiving it .
2	i would definitely use escapades again & have recommended them to the friends who are joining me at the brixham pirate festival in may :-)
2	what a delight finding a company designed specifically for females .
2	ordering & paying for my item was simple & straightforward & the bargain price i paid made it even better .

2	tip - if your ring them which i have feels_like 0000 '_s of times ( god_knows what that has cost me ) press 0 not 0 or you will be kept waiting for ages and even cut_off .
2	0 answers first ring .
2	they promise the world but never back up their promises , as i said , i cancelled a couple of days after_placing my order as i urgently_needed my new appliance but to my horror was informed that i wont get my money back for 00 days yes 00 days why oh why i ask .
2	its now 00 days after_placing the order i have a wonderful dishwasher deivered next_day from an excellent company but no money back from ultimate cock - ups .
2	to add_insult to injury i received a phone message and email yesterday to say my dishwasher is being delivered on 00th_feb , so again i have had to ring them .
2	be warned dont go here they are useless >
2	april_0000 - still not got my money back and in the long and lenghty process of recovery through cab and my credit_card company .

2	this was the epitome of stress_free shopping .
2	i '_m now the happy owner of xmas paper chains .
2	the only_thing this company could have done to make this purchase even better , is send staff to my house to assemble the paper chains !
2	went to oakland_furniture in glasgow ,
2	the ranges of oak_furniture are excellent with a lot to choose .
2	the assistant was very good and nothing was too much_trouble for him .

2	have spend 00_minutes trying to watch episode 0 of without you .
2	in the meantime , i could have cut my losses and watched episode 0 on itv0 .
2	after registering ( yes , that little buffering circle going round and round ), i eventually got a sign in screen .
2	except it wouldn_'_t let_me sign in .
2	so , i re - booted my computer .
2	still can '_t get into watching the programme .
2	so , i switched from firefox to explorer .
2	still no joy .
2	so i re - downloaded flash player and reinstalled it .
2	you guessed - that didn_'_t work either .
2	so i used the " contact us " link and read the faqs on itv_player - no joy there either .
2	so i used the form to compose a lengthy critique on itv_player directly to the company , taking my time to consider how to put my point over without resorting to four letter words .
2	then i pressed the submit_button .
2	then i got a " page not recognised "
2	suggest that itv either remove their on - demand service - or better still ,, why dont they phone the bbc and ask for the name of the bloke that did theirs ...
2	bought calvin kline aftershave at airport duty_free which cost £_00 more than fragrancedirect .

2	i get an_email and text_message every delivery .
2	every company i have ordered from companies who use dpd , the parcels have arrived .
2	unlike the worst which is royal_mail .
2	0 parcels on the trot went missing from argos , achica and amazon .
2	they wouldn_'_t even investigate my query blaming parcel_force .
2	now i won_'_t order anything from a company who uses royal_mail .
2	i have found dpd totally reliable .

2	it is now due for delivery tomorrow .

2	received a phone_call from them 00am on mother '_s day to say my mum would not be receiving her flowers that day as they had been delivered to the wrong warehouse .
2	i was offered " a free re order for the tuesday ' which i accepted as i live 000_miles_away & have no siblings so this would be her only mother '_s day gift .
2	near death flowers were delivered & the full_amount was taken from my bank_account .
2	when i phoned to complain , i was told the delivery was free but i still had to pay for the flowers .
2	no compensation was due ( i called twice to double_check ) so i cancelled my next account & have not shopped there since .
2	their loss .
2	how can you send me a letter saying it was a mistake and to phone up so you can put it right and then go on to say again it was , nt your fault !!!!!!!!

2	i have bought several large appliances and a fantastic range_cooker at prices that could not be matched when i compared on the internet .

2	excellent product and the cheapest price i could find on the internet .
2	quite possibly the most pain_free way to spend money !
2	from ordering to delivery faultless .
2	would not_hesitate to recommend :)
2	i loved the catalogue and the website was most informative .
2	it was full of fun things and i bought a puzzle for my 00 - tear old great nephew ' to make a parcel ' to go with a book token for his_birthday .

2	thanks again !
2	best price online for this jacket and delivery was faster_than promised .
2	very happy !
2	very detailed website with all the information i needed .
2	ordered three items separately and bbb checked to see if i wanted to combine them to save on postage - good service !
2	the single package arrived quickly with all i had ordered exactly as requested .
2	thanks !
2	i highly_recommend this company .
2	we placed a large order to furnish a house and were not disappointed .
2	the furniture is sturdy and of good quality .
2	their communication_regarding delivery was excellent and the delivery team were professional , friendly and very accommodating .
2	not one item out of the 00 we ordered was damaged .
2	i would not_hesitate to use them again .
2	i think many will agree , that nowadays when we purchase from the internet , without being_able to actually see what we are purchasing , we hold a lot of trust in honest_reviews , whether they be positive or negative , both are important to help us make a decision .
2	therefore when purchasing from a site recently , i was so impressed by the feedback collected by ekomi , absolutely no negative_reviews ... this company must be outstanding !!
2	however , i quickly learned why .
2	i '_m not saying that the reviews collected by ekomi were incorrect .
2	sadly , my purchase experience was not a good one , so i left a negative_review .
2	ekomi do not automatically publish your review , but start an arbitration process , to allow the matter to be resolved between seller and buyer ... fine , great idea !
2	however , the problem was never resolved , even_though the company were prepared to offer me a very small partial_refund .
2	i found this unacceptable and felt my review would actually be more helpful to guide future purchasers .
2	after a certain time period , i believed my review would be published , but no , ekomi simply closed the case and advised my review would not be published , even_though the arbitration process did not resolve the matter .
2	so i ask , is the arbitration process just an excuse to not publish negative_feedback ?
2	this is why ekomi , in my opinion , are not a reliable_source for good honest feedback .
2	“ we have today had our mantis light coffee_table delivered .
2	it looks beautiful .
2	the order process has_been so easy , alex was most helpful when i placed the order and i have been kept in touch right up to delivery , which incidentally was only 0 week from ordering ( over christmas ) and the delivery man even turned_up at exactly the time he said he would .
2	i '_m very impressed and will be ordering some more furniture to go with my table .
2	thank_you .
2	carole ”
2	i have hired many cars over the years and invaribly found that there are lots of " hidden " conditions .
2	those that say no deposit , no excess , no mileage constraints are usually untrue .
2	however , having been caught on these points in the past , i contacted indigo who did everything for me .
2	i hired a car through them for 0_days and it was the easiest hire experience ever !
2	i picked_up the car , went off on my trip , came back and handed the car back .
2	that was it !
2	it was lovely to feel secure that there would be no huge bill if someone was to clip the car in a car_park or some such occurrence .
2	i am now a regular hirer with them and they could not be friendlier , more helpful or easier to deal with .
2	i cannot recommend them highly_enough .
2	brilliant site - the products are really gorgeous and the service was very fast and efficient .
2	i will definitely use them again .
2	seeds delivered on time to give as christmas_presents .
2	well_packaged but unable to rate germination success as seeds will not be sown until later in the year !
2	have ordered from garden0less several_times and cannot_fault them on prices and delivery .
2	they sell a great range of branded gardening products at unbelieveably low_prices !
2	delivered very promptly and well_packaged .
2	postage charge was very reasonable for a fairly heavy parcel .
2	i would just like to say thank_you for the great service and products at fantastic prices .
2	bingo choices is a comprehensive guide to the world of online bingo , very handy for those just starting out with handy_tips and guides to playing and chatrooms .

2	i am a first time customer .
2	i will certainly be using them again the prices were very competitive
2	catherine was really helpful online also very pleased with the service from parcel0go would definately use again
2	i have repeatedly rung and emailed wallsandfloors , and have tried to get some sense out of them via their online_chat service .
2	all to no_avail .
2	the phone is not answered or cut_off , the online customer service is not available , and emails are either lost or ignored .
2	there '_s a recession on but some people don_'_t need the business , apparently .
2	i '_ve taken mine to a company which does .
2	i wish i '_d found this site before i ordered from them .
2	i have a similar story of long delays , wrong ink , slow or non - existent replies to emails and phone_calls .
2	i returned the wrong ink they sent .
2	the company has refused to send me my money back .
2	claiming the package arrived opened ( not by me !).
2	my credit_card provider recommended i ask for the disputed item to be returned .
2	subsequent_emails have been ignored .
2	i don_'_t give up too easily , nor does my credit_card provider .
2	i will keep you posted . this company has acted disgracefully so far .
2	i have spent so much time shopping around looking to find the best deals and even with the shipping_costs , supplement_warehouse has the better prices , and also a great variety of choices .
2	customer service is always pleasant and professional , shipping is always fast , and price match is great .
2	i will always come_back here , just for the reasons i have already mentioned but to really top - it - off ... who doesn_'_t like freebies ??
2	when i got my shipment , it was like christmas morning , opening all the " gifts " yay !
2	yipee !.
2	but seriously , you have great products with big savings !
2	thanks so much !
2	why wait for a bus on a cold day if you can be met at the carpark .
2	it '_s a no_brainer
2	excellent product .
2	excellent service .
2	printerland provided a fast and effective service ; and i was pleased with their follow_up focus on ensuring that my order was completed .
2	after many_years of having flat sheets , we decided to try fitted_sheets on our new bed as the mattress is extremely heavy to lift to tuck in sheets .
2	bedeck had the sanderson sheets we required with free delivery .
2	we were able to track the delivery easily .
2	we would have no_hesitation in ordering from them again and recommending them to anyone .
2	i was a bit_dubious in using fonehub as i hadn_'_t heard of them , but as they were offering the best price for my phone , and after_reading several positive_reviews , i decided to give them a try .
2	i needn_'_t have worried - the agreed price was paid into my bank_account within a few_days via the bacs system , and i didn_'_t even have to pay in a cheque .
2	the service was excellent , i would definitely recommend them and wouldn_'_t_hesitate in using them in the future .
2	well_done , fonehub !
2	!
2	i have used mobilefun twice_now for accessories and on both_occasions i have been delighted both with the products and the service .

2	well_done mobilefun !
2	what a fantastic company . i ordered a canon 00 - 000 mm l series lens late evening on tuesday 0th_feb and it arrived thursday_afternoon , two_days_later , all the way from hong_kong . i was supplied with full tracking_details with dhl every_step of the way , and texts to my phone giving information of delivery times . it was beautifully_packed with enough bubble_wrap to go round my house . i use amazon alot but it was £_000 cheaper from digitalrev . i advise anyone not to be put off by the fact it is based in hong_kong , they have provided me with an impeccable service , and i am still suffering from amazement at the speed of the delivery . i would definitely use this company again , and woud recommend anyone who values excellent service to do the same .

2	thought oh well , at first , then after almost 00_minutes of waiting ..... and much out of pocket , and in sheer frustration , called new booking line ... and , lo and behold got through straight_away ....... was not impressed i can tell you ....... what it said to me ???
2	we got your money now sod_off !!
2	thankfully the agent for new bookings was able to answer my very simple enquiry ........ but now i await an extortianate phone bill !!
2	thanks lowcost !
2	initially my add on partner paid rental_cars £_00 . 00 to hire a small car from enterprise . however when he got to enterprise they would not let him rent as he didnt have enough utility_bills to show them ( despite tv licence and aletter to him at his current address ).
2	however on asking for a refund so as to hire elsewhere they said it was rentalcars who had his money , not them . so he asked rentalcars for a refund and they refused ..... after a tense conversation with a manager there my friend managed to get £_00 . 00 back ..... money for old rope and a nasty rip_off , so beware good rental prices but , with a nasty sting in the tail !!
2	to add_insult to injury my add on driver got fined for parking at his own workplace despite having informed the company he was in a temp hire_car and them agreeing it was ok and signing reg no in every day ... this was obviously a mistake .... fine was squashed ... however , enterprise have charged_£_00 . 00 admin_fee to my bank_account and despite agreeing if the fine was deemed wrong and squashed , i would get my admin_fee back , no such luck ..... even after several emails to the traffic violation dept ... i have heard_nothing !!
2	i hired this car as a goodwill_gesture for a friend ... never ever again will i help anyone out like this again ....... even_though this was not his error ... i have been charged for it and i am the only one out of pocket for doing a good deed .!!
2	and enterprise have received £_00 . 00 for absolutely zilch !!
2	how is that fair ?
2	no wonder they are the cheapest car_rental company around ..... thats because they make their money in other ways , obviously !
2	!
2	wish i had discovered this site earlier .
2	ordered compatible_cartridges in error , as i know my printer doesn_'_t like them .
2	sure enough they didn_'_t .
2	despite three emails to company , my query has not been answered , despite offering to pay extra for my oversite .
2	desperate for ink , i have ordered from another company , at a cheaper price than the ' compatibles '.
2	it now remains to be seen if i can get any money back from printerinks .
2	they are not a chep or reliable company to deal with .
2	fantastic speedy service definately worthy of 0_stars simply the best when it comes to selling your old phone . money in account within three working_days from posting old_mobile .
2	item ordered late friday_night and was delivered exacty within the specified time_slot on tuesday .
2	cannot_fault price , service or information provided .
2	just started to register on line for the sage line 00 course and had excellent assistance from erick .
2	looking_forward to starting the course .
2	i ordered some replacement ear pads for my sennheiser px000 folding headphones .
2	this was my first order with hifiheadphones and i was very impressed ( which is not easy to do !).
2	the prices were the best i could find on the ' net .
2	i was kept up to date every_step of the way regarding my order via_email , delivery was very prompt and the item was well_packaged .
2	it is a rarity to receive such good customer service and i would definitely use this company again .
2	well_done and keep_up the good work .
2	promt collection of parcel , easy to track online and text notification received when delivered .
2	will definitely use again .
2	i purchased a dog coat from pet_supermarket but when it arrived i had ordered the wrong_size .

2	parrot loves_his nut foraging toy .
2	used this service as part of our holiday when we went to geneva from gatwick_south_terminal .
2	driver was ready waiting for me on arrvial to drop car off .
2	on our return was with us within 0 minutes of ringing .
2	excellent service will_definatley use again .
2	what a great company we ordered two skyflite rolling duffles and although they looked ok we did not use them until 0_weeks after delivery .
2	the side zip on one of the bags was faulty .
2	we contacted customer_services by e_- mail within 00_mins kevin naga game back to us .
2	they were very efficient and swopped the bag straight_away no_fuss or delay .
2	the new bag came within 0_days .
2	totally impressed and will definelty order from them again and recommend to all other friends and colleagues .

2	waited in all day saturday 00sr august for non exsiistant delivery even although they said they tried to deliver .
2	saw it was out for delivery today 00_minutes hanging on th phone still no joy .
2	this was paid to be a saturday delivery fat chance total rubbish service
2	everything i have bought for the girls has_been as expected and they love the styles would definitely buy from them again
2	very good value , very quick service . no_hassles
2	having run this catalogue for many_years i have seen many changes and not many of them for the good .
2	it used to be the sum total of your order could be spread over 00 weeks or 00 weeks , now it '_s each_individual item which can make the payments too high therefore limiting the number of items bought , so catalogue is missing out on profit .
2	it used to be a free phone number but now it '_s premium , which is not good as it costs a lot of money by the time all the options have been gone_through .
2	i know that catalogue prices have always been higher than shops but now the difference is getting far too much i . e .
2	ps0 in the shops £_000 in the catalogue £_000 .
2	£_00 is far too much of a difference .
2	also not getting rewards on sale items and other things is not fair on the person running the catalogue .
2	if items are out of stock then remove them from the on - line page or at_least mark it as " out of stock " it would be good if you could also request your cash rewards on - line as having to spend so much money in a phone_call to get it is not good enough and also the length of time it takes to get is not good .
2	it would be nice for long_term loyal_customers to get a wee reward or incentive as a thank_you .
2	was let_down by another company for a birthday banner , needed to get one in a hurray , found this company and got one .
2	excellent service , excellent product , excellent price , will definitely use them again .
2	highly_recommended .
2	love this personalised confetti , very unusual and a good size .
2	the web_site is very easy to navigate and it is easy to order .
2	my order came through very quickly also .
2	when i ordered our dish_washer on line i was offered a lot of possible delivery dates so chose the best for us .
2	after the sale was completed i got a phone_call from a nice young_lady to confirm that they had all the right details .
2	the washer arrived on the right day within the 0 hour_slot we had been given - which is pretty good considering we live nearly at john o ' groats !!
2	the washer has now performed very well since we got it a week_ago and altogether the whole_experience was pain_free , simple and satisfying .
2	i have no bad_word to say about this company and would use them again without_hesitation .
2	these magnets were bought for my husband to use on a ' gizmo ' on his motorbike and they were really great .
2	he was in his shed for ages playing with them - peace and quiet in the house for a while !!
2	seriously , i have to say that the magnets were very well_packaged and all the advisory warnings very clear .
2	there was enough choice for anybody . all in all a good product from a good company

2	i bought dining_table 0 chairs display_unit and got a free mirror i am so pleased the quality is to a very high_standard the chairs are really comfortable and look great .

2	spped of delivery and well_packed goods are second to none .
2	we always use fhr when booking our meet and greet at airports
2	a fantastic item . we received it within the time we were told but the only problem was that the delivery window was given between 0pm and 0pm and this was not adhered to . we had arranged for a friend to hold a key along with their telephone_number to accept delivery if we were not there at 0pm . fortunately when the delivery was made at 00 . 00am they were able to accept delivery .
2	we were lucky but what was the point of the delivery window period ?
2	despite this we were very pleased with the excellent packaging of the item .
2	we would certainly recommend you to our friends .
2	when he does find it he sleeps like a baby , it '_s soooo_comfortable and the other bonus is the granchildren can '_t jump up and down on it !!!!!

2	i '_ve already told my friends and family how pleased i am and recommended the site to them for all their pet needs .
2	delivered quickly unfortunately faulty but replacement sent immediately snd fast tracked thank_you would highly_recommend
2	they seem to like to blame website for pricing , offers inconsistencies .
2	i ordered a laptop and wireless adapters / extenders should have been free but even_though free on website £_00 added in checkout .
2	had to cancel order .........
2	another time order accepted , no product arrived and on phoning them , they said my card_details were incorrect , even_though they stored them on their system from previous_orders and i have used them again since ..........
2	but price was not honoured as offer had finished when i contacted them to find out where my laptop was ........
2	items arrived less_than 00_hours after ordering and at a great price , you can '_t get better service than that .
2	after ordering from viovet , which the site is so easy to use the products that i ordered arrived within_00hrs , brilliant now no need to order in_advance and the reminder service text is just the thing we never need run_out of our items again .

2	first time ever we have used this sort of agency to book a holiday - so felt a little_unsure_about it .
2	have previously only used travel_agents and therefore paid premium prices !
2	we need not have worried - website was easy to navigate , instructions clear and we received confirmation and advisory e_-_mails from time of booking until 0 week before_departure .
2	we were satisified with the price paid and in no way did the hotel " skimp " on their services to us .

2	really great products that work .
2	will recomend to all my friends with dogs .

2	partyrama will be my first stop next time i organise a party .
2	i '_m all about speed and convenience .

2	the printing is such high_quality and the service provided is excellent ...
2	online_chat with a real_person resolved all my questions so when i ordered i was confident in the product and when it arrived it was as good as expected .
2	i used anyvan to get a van with man who had removals insurance to do removals on a 0 bed flat .
2	a team of 0 turned_up on the dot and were pleasant and cheerful and uncomplaining .
2	they moved everything carefully and put it all where we needed it in our new home 0 . 0 hours_later .
2	i was sceptical_about the price being so low but it turned_out we we on the route for 0 other small removals so by sharing the service we shared the price .
2	it was great value for a top_notch service and we were emailed a vat_receipt after the job was done .
2	i would always start with anyvan for any future jobs .
2	i booked my first ever secret escape to a cotswolds country_house hotel as a treat for my husband '_s birthday .
2	it exceeded our expectations .
2	we had a fantastic time and the hotel was really luxurious , the service was amazing and we were thoroughly spoilt .
2	i totally forgot we were on a bargain break , but had a nice reminder when the bill at check - out was just for the bar .
2	i '_ll definitely be using secret_escapes again .
2	my order of royal_canin golden_retriever was £_00 cheaper_than in my regular pet store .
2	it was delivered so very quickly ( 00_hrs_later ) and within a convenient 0 hour time_slot from ultra reliable dpd ..
2	i '_ve saved big dog_world to my favourites because i '_m a real fan of the way they give back to dog rescues like large_breed rescue which i think is fantastic instead of banking all the profits .
2	a lovely company .
2	i re - stocked my 0 golden_retriever dogs ' medicine cabinet with pro -_kolin - this was listed at the best price online by far and free delivery was included too .
2	also , animed_direct was the only supplier of the larger 00ml syringes which you need for large dogs .
2	today is the 0nd time i have used the company and will recommend them to everyone .
2	the appointment was very easy to book online , great prices for tyres , no man jargon given to me on the phone , they did not try to sell me something i did not need , kev the technician turned_up on time , and did a fast efficient job - and all at home .
2	all in all , no_complaints and will certainly use them again

2	it arrived this morning , extremely well_packaged and with 0 free choccies !
2	i would definitely order from them again .
2	i have used oneclick several_times , for things i can '_t find on the high_street ( or out of stock ) and have had good service every time .
2	a wide_selection of goods , too .
2	thank_you erick for getting my voucher to valid after i let it expire by 0_days .
2	ordered a patio_set should have got delivered on 0nd may , received a phone_call from the delivery driver that he had been in an accident ( yeh right ) and couldn_'_t deliver that day .
2	he said he would deliver tomorrow 0rd may , i said that was ok but deliver after 0 . 00_pm as i would be at work .
2	came home and they delivered at 00 . 00 .
2	after several calls to arrow_xl they can '_t book me in for a delivery because it '_s not in the system yet .
2	i have contacted asda and ask them to give me a full_refund back .
2	i find vets reliable and speedy delivery
2	took longer_than i expected , but i am so glad to be able to use my iphone .
2	ain '_t technology great ?
2	what great service !
2	i ordered the mattress one day and it was here the next .
2	great price , great customer service and lovely delivery man .
2	i would definitely use this company again !
2	when i needed to get some more sikkens to re - treat my garage doors and weatherboarding i went back to my original supplier who , despite having it on their website , said that only a few stores nationally carried it !
2	a big_thumbs_up to tooled_- up . com who got it to me quickly , safely and at a competitive price !
2	i know where i '_ll be buying in the future !
2	thanks again !
2	!
2	our driver was waiting as we left the arrivals_hall and we were at our destination 0 hour after landing .
2	when we returned the driver was bang_on time and we were at the airport in 00_minutes .
2	ok so it '_s a bit more than catching the bus but a lot less hassle !
2	although i have used animed_direct for ages and delivery has always been a bit_slower_than other_suppliers , i allow for this when ordering .
2	however on the last order , funds were taken from my account on the day of ordering but goods were not despatched for a further week , despite_being told that if this could not take place within three_days i would be notified , this didn_'_t happen .
2	spoke to adviser at bedworld ; very helpful .
2	proceeded to order bed and mattress on 0th_may and payment made that day .
2	received confirmation of delivery for 00th_may - which was the selected date .
2	00th_may - no delivery arrrived .
2	i telephoned to query this twice during the day - once left voicemail_message ( call not returned ) and second time spoke to customer service representative who advised unless told otherwise it would definitely arrive up to 0 . 00 p . m . that evening .
2	by 0 . 00 it was clear this was not going to arrive .
2	had house guests for bank_holiday_weekend so quite inconvenient .
2	no contact from bedworld so i have requested full_refund .
2	easy website to negotiate .
2	i will definitely use again .
2	my technician today was andy , service was excellent , very friendly and helpful
2	would definitely recommend to friends
2	i bought an item as birthday_present on monday at 0 . 00pm .
2	paid_extra for 0st_class and noting their cut - off time for dispatch ( 0 minutes before i bought ) i expected dispatch on tuesday .
2	i added a note to say it was a gift and swift dispatch would be much_appreciated .
2	no sign of the item by thursday .
2	i contact them - they ignore me .
2	friday i email them .
2	just as the shops are closing on friday_night they email to tell me they have no stock and they '_ve sent a refund .
2	it '_s now too late to buy anywhere_else and have it in time for the birthday .
2	i can '_t recommend them for reliability , honesty , communication or efficiency .
2	i can recommend them for demonstrating a high_level of " don_'_t give a damn about their customers "
2	i '_ve_used them for many_years first through their catalogues and then through their website - never had any_problems that weren_'_t fixed immediately with a quick phone_call or email to their friendly customer_services .
2	fabulous products - not always the cheapest but always excellent quality .
2	fast delivery and it '_s free all year for the one £ 0 membership if you choose it .
2	we have a service contract with this company and to date we have been without_any central_heating since the 0 . th november !!
2	as reasonable people we initially accepted the 0_days wait before an engineer could attend although my husband is a pensioner , but hurray the engineer arrived last friday and was here for 0 hours but left unable to fix it advising it was a 0 man job !
2	ok still trying to keep reasonable we accept that they cannot ' re attend until today the 00th and we receive a confirmation text .
2	after waiting until_0pm and still no sign of a n engineer i contacted customer_services still trying to be quite reasonable but was told that the engineer had cancelled the job off his handheld !
2	clearly it is unacceptable and upon my request for a call back from a manager that can tell me what has_gone wrong and why their scheduling dept did not spot that our job had disappeared off their system but more_importantly what time tomorrow they can get an engineer out , do they ring us ?
2	you guessed it that will be a big_fat no .
2	i work for a national company that manages teams of engineers that use handhelds and let_me tell you if one of my staff delivered this kind of shocking customer service there would be action taken !
2	oh well best put another pair of socks on !
2	from ordering to delivery i was contacted by text or phone every_step fantastic service
2	very helpful friendly support staff & drivers would highly_recommend to everyone
2	i love shopping for plus sizes on e0p always get a good fit and the quality is good and love to have new clothes for next to nothing win_win all the way
2	i purchased some key '_s have had others from somwhere local that did not do the job at all used replacement_key '_s and orderd on sunday recieved on the tuesday work great would highly_recommend this company and the cost was a lot less_than others
2	arrived and phoned at luggage pick_up .
2	then phoned when we received our_luggage and had to wait 00_mins outside .
2	not a good experience after travelling for mauritius for nearly 00_hours .
2	driver made an excuse he was looking for us but we were at the spot outside the hotel as agreed .
2	we tried to ring several_times but the phone just rang or was engaged .
2	fantastic site , so easy to navigate , i was new to this site and it was recommended to me , very easy , and saved lots of money , will pass the site on 000_%
2	we were very pleased with the service .
2	everything was explained to us .
2	everything went_smoothly and the help and care we received was very good .
2	the company was very curtious and i would recommend them to anyone who wanted to release money from their property .
2	mr martin dyet could not have been more helpful . i would like to thank him for everything going so smoothly .
2	good products good efficient prompt servive
2	very good quality at a fair price . quick delivery . thank_you .
2	i am very dissatisfied with the service i have received .
2	i received the windspinner , but the on / off switch does not work .
2	i rang yesterday around 0 . 00pm to ask for help , the lady said she would find out and ring back within 00_minutes .
2	i am still_waiting .
2	i then emailed them to ask for help , and if faulty then a returns_label for return and exchange .
2	i have still heard_nothing .
2	i could not fault this company .
2	they were excellent on pick_up and also on delivery . i would recommend to anyone without_hesitation
2	i have been an on - line customer of oakfurniture_land for over 0 years and have purchased over 00 pieces of furniture to date for my new house !
2	my favourite range is the tokyo design which has a lovely finish to it .
2	although i do have some other pieces from other ranges .
2	when friends come to my house they always comment on the quality of the furniture and of course i tell them exactly where i purchased it !
2	the customer service is informative , warm & friendly .
2	the website is easy to navigate & provides lots of information with great pictures so you can see exactly_what you are purchasing .
2	i am also really pleased that you can now purchase that all important wax so that it all stays as good as new !
2	i will_continue to purchase from them .
2	in fact i shall be taking delivery of the tokyo tv_cabinet next week !
2	you will not be disappointed with any purchase from this company ...
2	it ´_s quick and easy .
2	as soon as you book your trip , your first thought is to find a hire_car
2	and this web_site which is appropriately named does just that .
2	what can i say , i don_'_t think it could be any better !
2	super quick and excellent product as usual .
2	been using goodprint for a few_years_now and i wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else
2	i found the website easy to use and my order arrived within two_days - very impressed .
2	i first saw hole punch pliers in an american jewellery_making book and had never_heard of them .
2	outside of the us this was the only site that i could find that sold them .
2	they are amazing and a really good price .
2	i have been ordering my dog '_s food from animed_direct for some time .
2	there prices are very competive and there delivery service is great .
2	never had a problem with them .
2	i have been using feel good contact_lenses for a couple of years and they have been great .
2	my lenses always arrive promptly and the price is amazing .
2	i would definitely recommend this site .
2	excellent service !
2	extremely_helpful , polite customer service - young_lady even went to warehouse to check number packs of product remaining and read expiry_dates .
2	order delivered spot_on time .
2	all this and best prices too !
2	i sold my car to ian ferguson on monday 00 february_0000 , at the hillington branch .
2	ian was friendly , courteous & extreme mealy professional .
2	it was a pleasure to do_business with him .
2	i '_d been round several garages , but the price ian offered me surpassed them all .
2	i '_m delighted with the whole_process from_start to finish , including receiving emails / texts reminding_me of my appointment , along with a list of documentation to bring with me .
2	ian is a real_asset to the business and i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to use this company again or recommend them to family / friends .
2	i ordered pro -_kolin paste for my cat , suffering with diarrhoea on wednesday_afternoon .
2	on thursday_morning , the postman delivered it to my door .
2	i couldn_'_t_believe_how wonderful this service was .
2	one dose of pro -_kolin later , my precious wee cat was back to rights again .
2	thank_you viovet .
2	will definitely use you again !
2	having my old washing_machine breakdown on a friday_evening with a post holiday family wash to do , i needed to replace as quickly as possible .
2	none of the high_st companies could offer me dalivery before the middle of the following week , which due to work_commitments effectively meant the following weekend .
2	however , appliances_online offered me a competitive price with delivery the following_day , i actually took the option of free delivery on the sunday .
2	delivery was prompt and efficient and i was kept_informed of expected delivery times .
2	appliances_online will be my first_port of call for any further_purchases .
2	well_done , have already_recommended to my friends !
2	thank_you campus .
2	the goods were packaged really well and as we paid a little extra to receive the goods quickly our children were very happy to get them when expected .
2	00 out of 00 .
2	my husband and i have both undergone the blended_vision procedure at lvc and we have both been extremely impressed by the standard of care and professionalism shown to us by all the staff .
2	nothing has_been too much_trouble during the last_year and as my check up appointments come to an end i can look back on a truly excellent service provided .
2	the whole_experience is highly_recommended - if you are considering this procedure - don_'_t_hesitate .
2	it is brilliant !
2	i thought the fowers were very reasonable , well advertised and i was notified of every_step frome ordering to actual delivery .
2	the recipient was highly delighted with the flowers and said they were beautiful .
2	i would use this company again for definite .
2	000_% satisfied :)
2	i researched every currency site and the currency_club definitely offered the best exchange_rate for usd on the day !
2	it was a little nerve - wracking handing_over so much money but there was no need to worry - the cash arrived exactly when stated .
2	fabulous service - can thoroughly_recommend .
2	the driver we used could not have been more helpful .
2	he was also pleasant and friendly , his price was reasonable and he stuck to the times arranged .
2	very pleased with the service
2	the website is easy to use and you are told when your order has_been despatched .
2	my orders have always arrived very quickly .
2	i started_using the site as our vet told us to feed one of our cats hills_prescription_diet as she is diabetic .
2	we bought the first bag from the vet '_s but it was very expensive so i went on line to see if i could buy it cheaper , medicanimal saves me a fair_amount on each bag .
2	right from the start our questions were answered so quickly .
2	our holiday was organised and everything_ran like_clockwork .
2	what we really like was the fact that when we emailed queries they were answered within minutes .
2	hope holland was especially helpful and really helped_us decide where to go and what hotels to choose .
2	we would recommend anyone to use this company and when we want to go to the usa again we will contact them for sure .
2	thank_you .
2	if you need to send flowers with the assurance that they will be of good quality and delivered on time then i would recommend that you use eflorist . co . uk .
2	it '_s the easiest_way to do it and very good value .
2	it '_s the first time i '_ve_used them and i will definitely use them again .
2	there are flowers for every_occasion and in every colour you could ever want .
2	the online system is brilliant and certainly saves you rushing_around when youi can reserve and collect !
2	the only problems seems to be lack of stock and chosen stores so sometimes when ordering a few items you cannot get them all from same store which is not good as they only hold reserved items until end of the next_day and if you have to wait for another item to come_back into stock it means going back to collect !
2	good all_round supermarket and prices , online ordering and delivery also good as they text with a delivery hour so no hanging_around !
2	and have not experienced any substitutes in recent orders which is good news !
2	ordered online and received the next_day at no extra_cost !
2	was kept_informed via_email of order and would not_hesitate to use again and to recommend !
2	we always use fhr services it '_s easy and convenient - never had a problem in over 0 years , staff helpful and if there '_s a problem just call them and they will sort it immediately !
2	i wouldn_'_t use anyone_else !
2	i will be using thia company for all my perfume purchases in the future ... fantastic price discounts compared to the retailers ... delivery service first_class .... what more can a girl ask for 😊
2	easily_assembled and i was ready to play . having just had to " skip " my 00 year_old challen baby grand i was really worried .
2	i had done days of research on graham '_s web_site and decided that yamaha000 would be my choice here was the moment of truth .
2	i switched on , pressed grand piano0 , normal and room and played .
2	i was in tears it was so wonderful .
2	there is no better review than that and i now look_forward to many more years of playing .
2	thanks .
2	i am very happy with the service offered by this company .
2	i was trying to locate a particular clothing item that was totally sold out in london ; located it in the us - price including taxes and delivery was only £_00 more than the normal_retail price here .
2	ordered it on the thursday , was kept up - to - date with delivery times via_dhl and it arrived today , saturday , beautifully_packaged and just what i wanted .
2	00_hours to my doorstep is amazing !
2	for me , a 0 day window to return seems reasonable , especially as any returns are hassle_free collections .
2	i would definitely use them again .
2	managed to get some ghd '_s and hair products at a huge discount over the john_lewis price .
2	fast delivery .
2	highly_recommend
2	alas the golf_trolley i bought online here ( great price , fast delivery ) developed a fault quite quickly .
2	customer_services were fabulous and offered a variety of choices - replacement , repair or money back .
2	nothing was too much_trouble and i was kept well - informed every_step of the way .
2	highly_recommend golfonline as a trustworthy company to do_business with .
2	have seen some of the not very good reviews and maybe it '_s because we are in london (?)
2	but i have had three deliveries recently from dpd and they were all within a one hour time_slot , which was unbelievably handy .
2	great updates_via_email and text - such a faultless service that i would go out of my way to order online from companies that use dpd
2	if you want a well priced , decent and reliable service then look no further .
2	everyne invovled is more than happy to deal with your problems , i can recommend you head straight for visualsoft .
2	i have no_hesitation in passing this company on , it has a great set_up , and one that i am more than happy with .
2	a fantastic team who are always professional and happy to help .

2	wonderful photos with a good selection of products .
2	i really like being_able to choose which photos to use for the multiples .
2	i bought a berkeley square item from perfume_click which was out of stock everywhere_else ( even on bs '_s own website ).
2	their price was very competitive and delivery was very quick .
2	very impressed - would definitely use again , and would recommend to others .
2	catherine was very friendly & helpful , she sorted my lost label out .
2	i would highly_recommend her , ask for catherine .
2	i felt very comfortable with her & she gave_me clear_instructions on what to do .
2	thanks again catherine .
2	0 *****
2	after two years have returned to handles 0 homes who provide an excellent all_round service , at prices that cannot be_beaten !
2	an item was missing from my order , but one short call and item was promptly despatched , a genuine mistake .
2	it '_s refreshing to deal with an honest , courteous and reliable company .
2	will certainly recommend and use again !
2	i should start by stating that i am a qualified extensionist and qualified hairdresser and have been for 00 + years .
2	i recently_purchased a ' remi cuticle correct ' weft from additional_lengths for my own personal use .
2	within days it was dry and brittle , and no matter_how it was conditioned or treated it just looked awful .
2	when the hair was wet it felt sticky .. which i know to be due to over processing , usually due to over use of peroxide .. after a week it was unwearable ... couldn_'_t_believe it .
2	i contacted additional_lengths and their only response was that i could not be refunded as this was a sale item , and expected me to forward the hair back to them at my expense so they could ' test it '.. leaving me out of pocket to the tune of £_00
2	if someone bought a dress in the sales for £_00 and it fell_apart within days you would be angry and demand a refund .. why does this not apply to extensions ???
2	especially from a so called reputable_company ?
2	?
2	product was exactly as_described and arrived quickly .
2	simple ordering procedure - no_problems at all , would recommend , no problem
2	i sent a number of old_mobiles off using the printable labels .
2	didn_'_t cost me anything to send them .
2	within a few_days i received an_email to say my bank_account would be credited with the amount originally_quoted .
2	so fast and excellent service .
2	highly_recommended .
2	thanks .
2	was really surprised at the quality of the meals .
2	having tried another diet ( all shakes and bars ) i was pleasantly_surprised with the tasty_meals - so much so that an evening in with friends they all ate a dish and thoroughly_enjoyed them .
2	will need to wait and see how i go with the weight_loss as i have an underactive thyroid but appreciate it may take longer to loose than other people .
2	on the basis of the food i am delighted .
2	ordered flowers as a thank_you and birthday surprise .
2	paid_extra for quick delivery .
2	no delivery ever transpired - late contact made about non delivery and i asked to deliver again .
2	no delivery ever happened .
2	impossible to contact all automated email contact
2	eventually reimbursed but would never use this company again .
2	a website that must be tried full of great prices and service was great quick delivery .
2	cant say enough good things about this ours cars are like showroom cars would recommend to anyone to get one of these .
2	i have just received my order today and when i opened the box my itchy_dog went crazy trying to get in the box .
2	after a chicken strip he was happy to sit and watch all the goodies i had ordered , i am sure he will love the chews and treats , he_loves_his bath and ordered some nice shampoo for him hopefully no more itchy_dog .
2	thank_you .
2	have been very happy with the goods i have ordered and delivery is quick and is free !!!!!!!!!!
2	!
2	well impressed with how quick i received my order keep the good work up
2	i '_ve_used these_guys for spare_keys a few time and find their website easy to use .
2	the keys always turn_up quickly .
2	would recommend them to anyone .
2	i am really please with my purchase .
2	the item is exactly as_described , it was dispatched quickly and i was kept_informed_throughout the whole_process .
2	the price was the lowest i could find and so really good value .
2	i would certainly buy from allweathers again and can confidently recommend using their website .
2	the service provided for every part of the transaction was first_rate .
2	my headphones were dispatched quickly and well_packaged .
2	they were well_presented in their box and i was most impressed with my complimentary lolly !
2	i can now enjoy my new ipod with ear phones that don_'_t keep popping out all the time .
2	thank_you , i would buy again and will recommend friends and family .
2	brilliant company extensive_range of products .
2	if they haven_'_t got it they will do their best to get it for you .
2	good bunch of lads who know their stuff and good knowledge of local water and beyond .
2	ordered ghd straigteners at 0pm and they arrived the very next_day !
2	fantastic item and service .
2	have no_hesitation in recommending .
2	thank_you !
2	writing this review as a very happy repeat customer !
2	cybercandy stocks everything you can possibly imagine , so i can get my " fix " of candy from the us and canada which i got addicted to while visiting and living there .
2	their best bargain ever has got to be the mystery bargain parcel , though ; i ordered one of these yesterday and had it in my hands under 00_hours_later - crammed full of stuff , most of which was actually still in date too .
2	i don_'_t know how they do it for the price , and i don_'_t know how they squeeze all those goodies into that little box either !
2	very highly_recommended !
2	!
2	i ordered clothes online .
2	i had received no confirmation e_- mail or any other e_- mail that suggested i had purchased .
2	debenhams online account did not recognise my order number .
2	all this was worrying as i had paid over_£_000 . 00 .
2	i telephoned debenhams on their expensive 0000 number .
2	they informed me that most of the goods i ordered and paid for are not in stock ( although the clothes i ordered and paid for were stated ' in stock ' at the time of ordering ).
2	debenhams spoke of 0 items that are in stock and will be sent out to me .
2	i asked what is the purchase price of these three items , and i was answered that all of my £_000 . 00 + order was taken out of my bank_account , even_though they do not have it in stock !
2	i asked how long will it take to be re -_imbursed for the amount i '_ve paid for stock they don_'_t have .
2	they answered it will take 0 - 0 working_days !
2	even_though i have nothing to show for the amount paid !
2	( they can make a lot of interest money if this is how all customers are treated ).
2	i asked if i could be sent an e_- mail please confirming what clothes i do have ; they said " i should have recieved one ".
2	i stated i hadn_'_t , and it '_s now 0 hours since that conversation , and i have no e_- mail whatsoever confirming i have paid over_£_000 . 00 on an order that apparantly isn_'_t in stock when stated it '_s in stock !
2	!
2	so , i have no idea which 0 items i am actually having to show for my £_000 . 00 purchase they have taken out of my bank .
2	i have re - searched debenhams website and cannot find the items i ordered and paid for .
2	looks like i '_ll have to ring again on the very expensive phone number , adding to total costs paid for goods i won_'_t receive ; and i wonder_if they will actually listen next time and actually send me an e_- mail !!
2	!
2	i '_ve also ordered from monsoon website , and i immediately received a confimation of order e_- mail , and they state they will not debit my account of any money untill actual clothes are dispatched .
2	debenhams could_learn from this .... but i really don_'_t think they are at all bothered !
2	!
2	i shopped at tesco , buying clothes ( utilising clothes voucher offer ).
2	tesco staff helped_me at self - service check - out .
2	as i went to leave the store , the manager and store detective reprimanded me .
2	the manager said the voucher " clearly_stated one use per customer " ( it stated in small_print which i hadn_'_t read ).
2	i said why has the staff helped_me , obtaining more vouchers for me to put through the check - out if this was the case .
2	the manager completely_ignored my words and re - iterated the point " it clearly_states ....".
2	the security guy said " we have been watching you , and you have gone to several checkouts , and you haven_'_t paid for your items ".
2	i had paid for all my items , and stated this .
2	security_guard said " we '_ve got security cameras all over this store , and we can zoom in on anything ".
2	he and the manager completely_ignored me , and said i must go to the back with them , and if i didn_'_t go with them , then they '_ll call the police .
2	so , i was frogmarched by them both to the back office .
2	immediately i got there , the manager told the security guy to ring the police .
2	they said i '_d have to wait up to an_hour , and all my bags would be searched by the police .
2	they diddn '_t want to hear_anything that i had to say , and they diddn '_t want to look at any of my reciepts or shopping .
2	i am a single_parent and needed to go home to my daughter who was home alone , but couldn_'_t .
2	i felt physically sick at the dis - belief of it all .
2	tesco took my passport number , address and all personal details , and recorded it in their ' theft incident book '.
2	the police came , and immediately found i was not gulity of any theft .
2	the police immediatley stated that i " did not look like a shop lifter " and asked if security had asked me what happened or did they check my reciepts or bags , and of course tesco had not .
2	i wanted a full_refund of my goods at this point , as i certainly would not enjoy the clothing bought under such awful circumstances .
2	tesco told me i could only recieve refund on one shopping bag , and no other .
2	( which was disgraceful , and i would have thought against my consumer_rights to return items for refund ).
2	i was frogmarched by the manager through the store to custumer services , to return goods and get a refund .
2	the manager told the customer service staff ' to check all goods ; to get back all clubcard_points given through purchase ; to keep all reciepts of mine for her to check and to get back all vouchers given ( the pay £_00 in store , and recieve £ 0 . 00 back ).
2	so , tesco kept all , and would not give me my reciepts back ( so that i could check full_refund back into my bank and have proof of the transactions ).
2	throughout this nightmare ordeal , not one person of tesco spoke or listened to me , they simply treated me as a lesser value being .
2	as i waited for the police to arrive , they spoke to each other around me , of their personal life , of recent events , anything , except look at or even acknowledge me !
2	i was treated as a shoplifter and criminal throughout , even after proved clear of any crime by the police .
2	the manager still spoke around and of me to customer service staff , not recognising me as a person of value or of equal rights .
2	all tesco staff still treated me as a common criminal and demonstrated their belief of this for all to see in store , both before and after police clearence of any wrong - doing !
2	only when i left the store did the discrimination and horror of it all end .
2	not once did anyone offer an_apology , explanation or empathy of the situation .
2	i remain in their criminal book along with all my personal i . d .
2	perhaps worst of all is tesco did not even consider any liability or wrong - doing on their part , it was as though to them they are completely right , i am scum and i remain scum !
2	tesco certainly will not learn from any of this ' mistake ', as they believe there was no mistake !
2	hence , they will not learn or train more from this experience , and i fear it will happen again and again to innocent_people who .
2	like me , have never had a criminal record or done anything wrong in their life !
2	i will never , never shop at tesco again and urge decent people to do the same .
2	tesco do not deserve decent custom or my my money to pay their wages when treated so inhumanly .
2	if it makes any difference of possible misguided perceptions of my character ( as the police stated i did not look like a shoplifter ), i work full - time with the nhs , and have always lived day - to - day valuing others whilst abiding by any given law .
2	my eyes are now opened to the easiness of ' becoming a percieved criminal ' by the say - so of just a couple ' powerful ' individuals whose beliefs and words had the power to withold and prevent me from being a member of society with freewill to come and go as i please .....
2	a very frightening thought for all law - abiding members of society !
2	buying on line can be a bit hit and miss but the previous_reviews about this company persuaded me to go with them .
2	they didn_'_t disappoint .
2	i initially sent for 0 swatches which were foc and delivered within 0_days .
2	i ordered two amelie blackout roman_blinds , they kept me informed regularly and provided excellent tracking_information .
2	they where easy to install ( according to my husband who didn_'_t swear once ) and the quality and weight of the material were very good .
2	the only_negative was the delivery company who must have placed something heavy on the blinds because they were slightly bowed in the middle of the frame .
2	fortunately we were able to straighten .
2	i had no problem with ordering 00kg of purina pet plan food .
2	i ordered it on the saturday and it was delivered on tuesday .
2	viovet emailed me the tracking_number of my order enabling_me to be kept_fully_informed of the progress of the delivery .
2	the goods were also competitively_priced .
2	it was the first time i '_d used them , so well_done viovet , for providing a good service .
2	they are very simple to order and arrive on time i would never use another site for my lenses
2	the online customer service system seems set_up to thwart any efficient dialogue with a m & s employee .
2	after a week of fruitless exchanges i gave up hope of resolving the issue .
2	short_term win for m & s maybe but a long_term loss .
2	webtogs were recommended to me by a friend .
2	my order was delivered promptly but sadly the fit was not quite right ( nf apparently think i need more boobs and shoulder to balance out my hips ).
2	the return process was uncomplicated and the return of the package was speedily acknowledged and my credit_card refunded .
2	i '_ve recommended webtogs on to other family and friends and they have also had excellent service .
2	i was trying to order roller_ball pen_refills but kept getting sites in canada , the u . s . and europe .
2	i was ready to give up when i came_across cult_pens website , in the u . k .
2	it was very easy to find and order the refills i wanted and i was delighted when they were delivered the very next_day .
2	great service .
2	speedy delivery - no_problems
2	this company gives very good service and great products
2	i won the watch some while ago , and am delighted with it
2	it was lucky that we hadn_'_t had rain , or a rubbish collection that day .
2	i think that the delivery service left a lot to be desired - no card was left to say that the parcel had been left , or where it was
2	i have been using cheap_smells for a few_years_now and have always been able to find a good bargain on really good perfumes at really good prices so i would and have recommended this site to all of my friends and work_colleagues .
2	keep it up .
2	i was very pleased with the wheres wally suit purchased for our child , who needed it for world_book day at school .
2	the suit arrived on time and was very much enjoyed being worn repeatedly .
2	i would have no_hesitation in using fancy_dress ball again .
2	i ordered my grandson a fantastic mr_fox costume for world_book day .
2	it came much_quicker_than they said and he absolutely_loves it .
2	it is a perfect_fit and he says he is going to wear it as a onesie after the event .
2	excellent quality and excellent service .
2	highly_recommend .
2	the furniture is so comfortable and looks so stylish .
2	everyone who has seen it just falls in love with it .
2	it has_been out on my decking all winter with no cover and still looks as good as new .
2	would thoroughly_recommend
2	first time i have used the currency_club .
2	as a travel_agent i travel reasonably frequently and will definitely use them again .
2	great , speedy and efficient service .
2	thank_you .
2	i would have absolutely no_reservations in recommending appliances_online to anyone in the market for what they sell .
2	from initial order through to delivery , and aftersales , including the cancellation of the lifetime_guarantee which i decided not to keep , it was seamless .
2	communication was prompt and efficient - generally most excellent and rare to find these days .
2	printerland mean what they say - richard the sales_rep was really helpful , nothing was too much_trouble for him .
2	printer came as promised , well_packed up too .
2	delighted with the product and will_defo be using printerland again .
2	absolutely excellent service from who art now .
2	andy especially has_been wonderful and nothing was too much_trouble for him at all .
2	the response to e . mails was just great .
2	really delighted .
2	can '_t wait to see the finished_article .
2	defo use this company again and have already_recommended it to a few friends .
2	the speed that this company respond & deliver your order is amazing !
2	i '_ve ordered a few_times & never been disappointed with the goods or any aspect of their service .
2	i '_ll definitely order again soon
2	thanks fragrance_direct .
2	i bought a pc from braebo after_reading_reviews , it arrived quicker_than stated . after 0_months of hard use , it as not given me any_problems . i have recomended to friends , good company to deal with , buy one !
2	really fast service , everything well_packaged and as_described on the website .
2	( actually the dunoon mug was even_nicer then its photo (" vogue ", leopard spot ).)
2	ordered two bouquets , at the same time , to be delivered to the same address , on the same day .
2	one arrived , one didn_'_t .
2	the second one arrived the next_day but no - one was in .
2	my email complaint and request for an explanation has_been ignored .
2	the flowers arrived on the monday and i '_m told they were lovely .
2	i '_ll try serenata one more time , but any more glitches and bad manners and i '_ll not use them again .
2	i placed my order on 0th_june and received an acknowledgement .
2	i also uploaded the prescription , as requested .
2	also acknowledged .
2	i heard_nothing more until the 00th , when i received a " reminder " that the prescription had not been received .
2	i was surprised but attached it to an e_- mail on the same day .
2	i checked by phone that it had been received on the 00th and later that day an e_- mail confirmed that the order had been despatched .
2	unfortunately , the order did not arrive for another 0_days .
2	i will try the same company again , but will check that the prescription has arrived
2	when uploaded .
2	lowest_price .
2	delivered next_day .
2	item as describe .
2	highly_recommended .
2	will use again .
2	memory ordered on sunday_afternoon .
2	texted 0 . 00 am on monday stating advising that it had been posted .
2	it arrived in tuesday mornings_post and is now fitted and appears to be working perfectly .
2	many_thanks .
2	would recommend highly .
2	prices seem to be very competitive .
2	this does not appear to affect the quality of the products .
2	delivered within 00_hours .
2	i have recently ordered two radiators on separate_occasions .
2	they both arrived by 00 . 00am the next_day , one of which was ordered on a bank_holiday .
2	their design has already been admired_by many .
2	the quality looks super and they look as if they are made to last .
2	the price was also very good .
2	i shall order from them again and would recommend them to others .
2	i am very pleased with my purchase .
2	wish it was better value for money , but good quality product .
2	it was the first time that i used the company .
2	i would use them again but not for something that i urgently require .
2	i had to send 0 emails on 0 consecutive_days , 00 days after_placing my order .
2	on the 0rd day i got an apologetic email_informing_me that they were now dispatching my item ( what was going on for 00 days ?
2	i have no clue .
2	what would they have done if i hadn_'_t enquired_about my order ?
2	i have no clue ).
2	the thing is that they took the time to send me a promotional email instead of answering my request during my 0 - day -' chase .'
2	yes i got what i ordered but i do not recommend to use this company if you are in a hurry .
2	some bargains on this site , and lots of lovely pens .
2	wide_selection of batteries with detailed_information .
2	reasonable_prices and swift delivery .
2	very helpful staff and the bed is good value and comfortable .
2	excellent service .. goods as_described and delivery speedy too !
2	!
2	thanks to tripadvisor we have enjoyed some truly_memorable holidays thats to advise gleaned from their hotel reviews !
2	also some bargains to be had !!
2	!
2	my purse arrived less_than 00_hours after ordering it online .
2	fantastic service and the quality of the product was excellent too .
2	best online purchase i have made .
2	fabulous shoes , promt delivery , will definitely be recomending you to my friends & family , looking_forward to buying more shoes from you .
2	adam was very friendly arrived as arrange . two front_tyres were fitted very quickly and to our complete_satisfaction . adam filled in the report then went through it with us advising us on the other tyres . you were £_00 cheaper_than my recommended garage . thank_you .
2	i first came_across sustainable furniture when i was looking for a root tree table , similar to the one on saturday_morning kitchen .
2	when i realised that they had them , my friend and i travelled all the way from surrey to cornwall to have a look .
2	the range of furniture was very good and the table simply beautiful .
2	the staff in the showroom were very helpful and knowledgeable and i ordered one straight_away .
2	as this table is being shipped abroad they kept it for me until now , october , and it has_been delivered .
2	the root , which is very heavy , was appropriately wrapped in bubble_wrap and was delivered first .
2	the table top , which is 0m in diameter , and even heavier , was delivered yesterday , by two very nice delivery people .
2	they delivered it straight_into our storage room with great patience and good humour even_though they had had a nightmare journey , with delays on the m0 and generally terrible traffic in london .
2	i also bought a 0 . 0m teak root vase and a reclaimed teak mirror , both of which are stunning .
2	i am really looking_forward to seeing it all in place in our holiday home .
2	i would not_hesitate to recommend sustainable furniture to my friends and will be using them again in the future .
2	i ordered a new shower_tray , door and shower_head from betterbathrooms .
2	they all arrived on time .
2	unfortunately , as i am not a plumber , i bought a slim line shower_tray ( i think they look much_nicer_than the other ones ) i didn_'_t know that i would also need to buy a kit that included the legs .
2	when i have bought shower_trays in the past they have come with the legs .
2	when my plumber realised that the legs weren_'_t included , i contacted betterbathrooms and asked where they were .
2	i was told that i should have bought the extra kit and that i would need it in order to plumb in the tray as it was also going on a concrete floor .
2	as i didn_'_t want the plinth that came with the kit i asked if it was possible to just buy the legs .
2	i was told that someone would get back to me .
2	unfortunately no one did .
2	i contacted the company again ( on the same day , late_afternoon ) and was told that the legs were around £_00 , and that with delivery they would cost about £_00 .
2	the cost of the complete pack , with the plinth was around £_00 , so i decided to order the complete pack , only to be told then that they were out of stock and even if they were in stock i would not receive them the next_day as it was too late for a next_day delivery .
2	so i had a plumber who couldn_'_t do any work , and a tiler who was waiting to tile the shower room after the tray was installed and no kit .
2	the next_day i spoke to dave in the wigan office .
2	he was very helpful and suggested that i buy a kit that contained four legs and have my plumber put supports under the middle of the shower .
2	thank_goodness he suggested this as i was desperate to get the equipment needed to complete the installation .
2	i had also bought a shower_head that was too small , so i ordered another one .
2	this was on a next_day delivery but actually took two_days to get to me .
2	i did phone to complain_about this and spoke to someone in customer_services .
2	she was very helpful , found out when the delivery was occurring and said she would try to get the cost if the delivery refunded .
2	i still_haven_'_t heard_anything from betterbathrooms regarding this .
2	it should be automatically refunded if the items don_'_t arrive on time , there is nothing to think about .
2	overall i would say that betterbathrooms are good value for money .
2	their staff are helpful , but it would be a good idea if there was a pop up when ordering these slim line shower_trays asking if feet are needed as they are not included .
2	after all there is a pop up offering accessories etc .
2	also refunds on delivery charges should be automatic if they do not arrive on time .
2	i have been using achica now for some time and think the site is great .
2	there are a lot of good quality products , they come very well_packaged .
2	the only_downside is that you sometimes have to wait for a while for delivery .
2	i am very pleased with my cloakroom corner cupboard / hand_basin and tap .
2	the quality is very good for the price of the items and i am very happy that i bought them .
2	they arrived the day after i purchased them online and were well_packaged .
2	i am very pleased with the service i received from bestbathrooms . com .
2	i had been looking for this product for my grand_child '_s birthday but had been unable to find it with a good delivery time .
2	this company had them in stock and delivered in time .
2	thanks .
2	this is a great site for all_sorts of books .
2	great prices .
2	quick delivery .
2	packed well .
2	quick del .
2	good packaging .
2	good products .
2	gret prices . lotsof variety
2	this is the first time i have used pharmacy first and i am very impressed .
2	quick and easy ordering , easy form to fill in and quick delivery .
2	well_done .
2	will definitely use again .
2	everything i have ordered from amazon has_been excellant .
2	very pleased with this company .
2	the cat scratch activity pole that i purchased has_been used by our 0 cats and they enjoy trying to get the mouse .
2	the material is strong and the 0 scratch poles are very rigid .
2	for the price it has_been a good purchase and would use the company again .
2	great communication .
2	highly_recommend this company .
2	item arrived quickly .
2	excellent service .
2	i have used viovet a number of times - the product info provided is very helpful and prices very competitive .
2	the ordering pocess is very easy and delivery is prompt .
2	would recommend them .
2	visited yesterday as wanted some fresh_meat from the butcher dept .
2	the staff in the butchers were friendly , funny and very helpful .
2	came away with some beautiful lamb .
2	a lamb longboat !
2	cooked for 00th_birthday meal and it was the best lamb ever .
2	thank_you guys !
2	yum_yum !
2	also got some beautiful flowers for mother in law and they were really lovely .
2	we always go here every year for our xmas trees and garden plants .
2	it '_s one if my favourite places .
2	i have purchased several_pairs of shoes from shoetique , always delivered really quickly and returns dealt_with equally efficiently .
2	they are where i look first when searching on - line for shoes .
2	great service and super_fast delivery
2	when i learned that nightfreight were delivering our new mattress i was somewhat concerned to read all the negative_reviews here ; however they were brilliant .
2	the driver phoned first thing in the morning to tell us what time they would be delivering , and again 0 minutes before arriving at the end of our lane to enable_us to get there and collect the mattress ( the lane is too narrow for big wagons ); he was really helpful and polite too .
2	thanks andy !
2	i saw a game advertised on the gameseek website ... what a bargain ... singstar 00 '_s with microphones ... well i ordered it straight_away .
2	when it turned_up 0_weeks_later .. no microphones , so i e_- mailed .... they said it didn_'_t come with microphones .
2	i had cut and pasted their own ad .. but no .. it never had been advertised as such !!!
2	!
2	i returned the item .. they .....[ name ].. acknowledged_receipt and implied that they would look in to the misinformation .
2	nearly two months later .... no refund , no response .
2	paypal can '_t take out a dispute as it '_s over 00 days since purchase ... that '_s because gameseek have been stringing me along .
2	i am now following the small_claims court route .
2	these people should not be allowed to get away with this sort of thing .
2	how much money do they make from ripping_people off like this .
2	if you want to watch adverts , then this is the place to come .
2	they work fine .
2	as for the programmes themselves they play nowhere as well as the adverts .
2	there is constant stopping and starting , then waiting while buffering .
2	the suspense of wondering when you will see the next two minutes is excruciating .
2	listening to it is like hearing an old wireless going through the tuning , its a foreign_language like i '_ve never_heard before .
2	watching it is like seeing a picture for every three minutes of words .
2	i '_ve seen more animation in ' the clangers '.
2	if you want the ' added enjoyment ' of a full screen , then forget about it .
2	unless of course you don_'_t mind the excitement of having ' press esc to exit full screen ' stuck across your screen , blocking out the view of an already unwatchable picture .
2	come on itv , pull your finger out and sort_out these problems before everyone starts to leave a sinking ship .
2	i love amazon , always fast service sometimes you have to look around for best price as it is not always the most obvious but easy to navigate .
2	just got a kindle and i love it although could have more titles for the teenage market .
2	found tthe website easy to use , postage bag was sent following_day .
2	i posted my old phone on the friday_lunchtime and my money was in the bank monday_morning .
2	smooth and easy .
2	would and have reccomended to all my friends
2	products arrived promptly and exactly as expected .
2	well_packaged .
2	i received an acknowledgement email that my purchases had been dispatched and , despite it being the second week in december , one of the items arrived within 0_days , i was so pleased .
2	the other was notified to me as being out of stock .
2	i rang to speak to them to get an idea of when it was likely to be in and they gave_me a date for the following week .
2	i rang on the day after they said they were expecting them and was advised that unfortunately it had not arrived but they were willing to post me another volume in its place .
2	i accepted this and , again , it arrived within 0_days .
2	it was also very well_packaged .
2	absolutely_delighted with the service and won_'_t_hesitate to order from them again .
2	my ear_plugs are fantastic !!
2	my husband snores very loudly and these are the only ear_plugs that keep that sound out so that i can get some sleep !
2	!
2	lenses were received 0_days after_placing the order !
2	this happens every time .... not just this time .....
2	my husband and i have both been calling customer_services and sales since we originally ordered this set months_ago - when it was in the ' spring sale ' that was supposedly ending soon , but that just rolled into the ' summer sale '.
2	each time we have been told different facts about the current status of the order and promised it would be delivered by the end of march , april , 0th_may and every week since ….
2	we were promised it by easter , then may bank_holiday and the late may bank_holiday but nothing .
2	we no_longer trust what is said to us on the telephone as it seems to be the most convenient lie to get_rid of us .
2	for example , my husband called 0_weeks_ago and was told it was definitely in the warehouse and was just being checked and arranged for despatch .
2	i called back days_later and was told that it hadn_'_t arrived and was due in the following_monday .
2	i called again and was told that it was in the warehouse and being arranged for despatch and would be with us before the end of this week .
2	each time we ’ re told we will be contacted to arrange delivery but no one has ever called us to update the status of the order – it is down to us to continually call to chase them .
2	however , today i cannot get through on the phone lines – i ’_m repeatedly left on hold for more than 00_minutes on each of the customer_services or sales lines .
2	and no response to my request for a call back and email either .
2	it ’_s apparently that either the few good testimonials on trustpilot are either pure fiction or a very small handful of satisfied customers for a few items they happened to have sitting_around and could send out .
2	there are so many unhappy_customers on the review sites – i notice they have given up replying to them .
2	all the spin listed on their website about their customer service is not true – they have failed us in every_aspect .
2	even down to the reason we chose to order from them was their ‘ 0 year_warranty ’ but reading the small_print , this is only on indoor furniture despite the 0 year_warranty being emblazoned on the top of every page of outdoor furniture .
2	each time we visit the website we see the same set still available for sale and with promises of ‘ order me now for delivery …’ with yet another date .
2	why can people order it for delivery on monday 00th_may if they still_haven ’_t delivered ours and items for the many other unhappy_customers that they have taken money from but failed to deliver the goods ?
2	that '_s probably just another lie !
2	we '_ve been using animed_direct for 0 years_now and regularly get our prescription_medicines for our cat from them .
2	the web_site is easy to use and easy to upload a scanned_copy of the prescription .
2	the medication is always delivered promptly and at a reasonable cost - cheaper_than purchasing from the vet despite a prescription fee charged by the vet .
2	they are always long use by dates on genuine products in genuine packaging .
2	brilliant .
2	easy from_start to finish .
2	their advisor ran us thru all the details & made sure we got the package that suited_us & double_checked that all details where recorded properly .
2	whole_process took 0 - 0_weeks till the cash was in our bank
2	my mum '_s flowers arrived at 00ish on mother '_s day , a perfect time .
2	she was moved to to tears and told me the flowers were beautiful .
2	she loved the chocolates and the balloon also .
2	my daughter recommended the company to me and i am so glad i used them .
2	i used interflora at christmas and was disappointed with the flowers they sent to my family .
2	i would recommend serenata_flowers to all my family and friends .
2	a lovely product and excellent service .
2	the best service ever and the price is reasonable !!!!!!!
2	!
2	very helpful staff , they kept me informed all the way through , and found a better deal for me . a painless experience .
2	ref_000000
2	i was struggling to find any nets that could be made to size ( odd length windows ), in a cream with header tape .
2	woodyatt_curtains were the answer and a bonus was the really good prices .
2	when they arrived , much sooner_than_expected , i was very impressed with the quality .
2	i highly_recommend woodyatt_curtains .
2	i have used equestrianclearence on a number of occasions and have always found them great for quality , cost and service !
2	they are my first_port of call for all things equestrian .
2	ok , i cannot recommend quidco enough , i just carry out my online shopping as normal but make_sure i click the link through_quidco & voila - i get cash !
2	!
2	i ordered a whirlpool dishwasher from wright buy on the tuesday & they delivered it on the thursday , they even accommodated my request change of delivery address .
2	very pleased , the price was great too
2	thank_you wright buy
2	excellent service , the cheapest i could find the product ( helium ) & fast delivery just before christmas too .
2	thank_you
2	great gifts .
2	good prices and quick delivery .
2	... but you get what you pay for .
2	they have best quality protein in the uk and the different tastes are quite good too .
2	service is prompt and efficient .
2	tastes good , prices are comparable to others and compared to places like myyprotein the quality difference is obvious ,
2	subject line says it all .
2	easy site , good price , quick delivery with dpd in allotted_time_slot - just what internet orders should be like .
2	well_done .
2	may not pay immediately but i had the money within a few_days - best price which was main point
2	i am reviewing my experience here - ordered one day , paid for next_day , arrived next_day , good price - job_done !
2	0_star_review
2	i have been reading with interest other bad_reviews though and i don_'_t think most people realise that my protein were bought out by the hut_group last_year - since then their customer service will have been absorbed into the hut '_s large cal centre .
2	the upshot of this is that there will always be a transition period where things go_wrong .
2	however , a business is assessed as much on the way it deals with problems as much as how good it is at getting goods out the door quickly !
2	and it seems this is where they maybe ought to be looking at .
2	however , i have no gripes whatsoever - arrived quickly as promised at a good price .
2	cannot_fault , bought through their ebay store but did this because it was cheaper on p_&_p than purchasing through their " sister / other " site which is big_dug which seems to like to price low and then whack you with massive p_&_p_charges .
2	good price , quick delivery - buy from here rather_than their sister bid dug site !
2	all good from this site - purchase a few_times from them now for myself and for my kids - no_problems at all .
2	the sooner the govt reduces the vat threshold so that companies like play can '_t take_advantage of it the better .
2	then we can buy from companies that don_'_t split an order for 0 cd / dvds into 0 parcels so i end up having to pick them up from the post_office 0 bloody times !
2	sure pricing is ok but just so they save the vat they split orders into amounts that are less_than £_00 or something .
2	i see that tesco , asda and all the rest of them ship from the channel_islands too nowadays so they can all save on tax - while the rest of uk companies have no choice but to pay it - money goes to money as usual
2	i have bought from them a few_times and if you are willing to wait a few_days longer_than say amazon then you can probably get it cheaper here than most .
2	the issue is with electrical equipment that requires a uk plug - both time i have not had one and it '_s come with a eu plug instead - so i have had to go out and buy a plug convertor - kinds of defeats the savings .
2	we have used virgin for our florida flights quite a few_times - using air miles collected through amex and then xferring them to virgin .
2	problem we '_ve had this past 0 or 0 flights is the attitude of the virgin crew on the plane has_been really poor .
2	sure they smile when it suits them but there has_been an air of everything is too much_trouble recently - rolling eyes , sighs , just general body language that indicates they would just rather sit_down and read their mags in between the times they throw meals at you .
2	we tend to travel with their premium service ( not upper but better_than economy ) and you tend to pay £_000 /£ 000 more per_person per flight - so a family of 0 it racks up .
2	for that money i expect a courteous service at all times .
2	we try and avoid them from now on .
2	we have had better cabin_crew service from bmi and even ba to be honest .
2	shame really , used to like virgin at first .
2	saying that - going to dubai with them this year in upper class so we will see - again - not by choice - just the only ones that flew there on the dates we had where we could use our airmiles to reduce the cost .
2	found them on google and they were one of the cheapest ( maybe not the cheapest but the cheapest looked , well , too cheap !).
2	website was easy to use - seemed to have loads of security - order arrived next_day - job_done !
2	i ordered a dorado gt0 from them - pre_- sales was good ( i thought at first ) - and arrived next_day as promised .
2	however , then it went wrong .
2	firstly - the windows os installed was a trial version and they didn_'_t include the disk or the license key .
2	however , this was sorted around a week_later when they shipped it separately .
2	however , i clearly_stated to the salesman i need a system that i could hook up twin dvi monitors as it was for a member of staff that did photo / design work and they needed digital quality displays
2	he said this one came with dvi and hdmi so that would be fine as long as my monitors accepted hdmi .
2	i checked and both monitors accepted dvi and hdmi .
2	arrived and while 0 monitors can be hooked up only 0 can be digital - the other has to be analogue
2	it has take 0_weeks to get them to finally accept that the pc will not output twin digital outputs
2	i have asked what they intend to do about it - i have not asked for compensation or asked for a new graphics_card free
2	i explicitly stated i would pay for an upgrade for the grahpics card and will send back the one that '_s installed if they send me one that will output twin digital
2	several days passed and not a word .
2	finally , got a message to call them and was told that " i have tried but they won_'_t budge and won_'_t do anything - just go out and buy a new graphics_card " they said .
2	appalling service - appalling pre_- sales knowledge
2	i am now going to go to trading_standards .
2	i will not return the pc for a refund because it is fully up and running - just not working as it should .
2	i spent 0_days installing and getting it set_up so i am not going through that again .
2	i will have to go out and buy a card that fits .
2	they wouldn_'_t even tell me what card would fit in this machine - just " go and sort it yourself " i was told over the phone .
2	i would never recommend this company to anyone ever .
2	a company is built on how it deals with the customers after the transaction .
2	if all they had done was say " we are sending out a graphics_card that will work - pop the other one back to us and we '_ll charge the difference " then fine .
2	i was not asking for a freebie - i accepted it was likely to be lack of knowledge on the salesman part but we all make_mistakes and i would happily pay for an upgraded card - just sort it out !
2	but to tell me to just buy another one myself is terrible service .
2	i simply cannot_believe there is a company that doesn_'_t go bust that offers this low level of service .
2	quick , easy and prompt payment .
2	are better deals out there but they make it so easy i keep using them !
2	however , recently_sold them an iphone for £_000 and i asked them how they made money on that to be told they sold them to developing countries .
2	so , that makes me a little uneasy to be helping a company make money out of africa or wherever .
2	i mean , how can they make money on a 0nd_hand iphone when paying me £_000 ?
2	doesn_'_t sound right at all hence lowered review rating .
2	0_stars for service , 0_stars for morals .
2	having used sainsbury '_s and tesco '_s online in the past i had now stuck with ocado for a couple of years .
2	they always turn_up in their allotted_time , they call if they ' re late or whether they can be early even .
2	they have only ever substituted anything from my list once compared to sains and tesco '_s who did it nearly every time .
2	the drivers are courteous and always bring my bags to the door ( which is a long way from where they can park !).
2	oh , and they now price match tesco on a lot of the daily stuff too .
2	very good
2	delighted with my t shirt , good quality & true sizing , super fasr delivery too , would highly_recommend this company to all .
2	would not_hesitate to use you again in the future .
2	i chose suntransfers . com randomly through google and it was a wise choice .
2	the driver was waiting for us at the airport with a clear sign on an ipad so it really stood_out amongst the paper signs , he was helpful and chatty and recommended a few places .
2	on the way back the driver arrived on time and helped with the cases ( we were 0 ladies travelling_alone ) it was rush hour and the traffic was bad but he turned around and took another way to avoid any delay , at the airport he put our bags on a trolley without asking , a gentleman indeed .
2	these speakers were on the top of my nephew '_s wish_list and he is highly delighted with them purchasing was quick and easy and delivery time was excellent , very well_packaged and i would highly_recommend menkind
2	the best pet supplier to order from quick and easy with free_postage
2	can '_t recommend you more highly .
2	everything was perfect .
2	thanks
2	next_day delivery at an exceptional price will definitely use again
2	0_days of sunny warm weather !
2	!
2	excellent hotel ( wyspianski ) nothing too much_trouble
2	food great
2	just 0 mins_walk from main square
2	number one for a superb after sales service , friendly and very helpfull staff who care about their customer_satisfaction , i would certainly recommend them to anyone , thank_you :)
2	my washing_machine_broke_down so i ordered a new one .
2	i chose all day free delivery ( 0am - 0pm ) and got a call to say that my delivery would be between 0 : 00 and 00 : 00 in the morning .
2	i went online and the slot was narrowed_down to between 0 : 00 and 0 : 00 .
2	yippee ..... i wouldn_'_t have to be waiting around all day !
2	!
2	the delivery men called me to say how long they would be and arrived by 0am .
2	they were very friendly and courteous .
2	a lot of companies could_learn a lot from appliances_online !
2	i will definitely by using them again .
2	the website was easy to use and my sweatshirt arrived within a few_days .
2	very good , efficient service .
2	a few_weeks_ago i went into oakfurnitureland in milton_keynes as we needed a new dining_set to accommodate the family coming to us for christmas day .
2	as soon as i entered the store i was greeted_by a very friendly and efficient member of staff , who listened fully to my requirements and then helped_me find exactly_what i was looking for .
2	the goods arrived on friday the 00rd , the condition was immaculate and i knew_exactly when they were arriving as i received and email and text_message_confirming the delivery .
2	highly_reccomended !
2	ordered dimplex electric_fire and found process so easy .
2	immediate email_confirmation and delivery details .
2	fire arrived next_day and courier company used so efficient .
2	gave delivery slot within 0 hour and delivery van could be tracked on line .
2	saved all the usual waiting around all day for delivery which you get with some companies who give a delivery time of between_0am & 0pm .
2	full_marks all_round
2	could definitely recommend this company i had no_problems_whatsoever
2	azienda molto professionale , prodotti molto buoni e soprattutto prezzi molto bassi .
2	pet_food is heavy so delivery is ideal and prices competitive .

2	i have recently signed_up with freestart for my website for my business ' a slice of elegance ' cake makers in the vale of glamorgan ...... not being very technical with computers i had to call in and admit my ignorance on a simple item regarding the photos on my site .
2	they were fabulous , not only do you actually speak to a real_life person , they are so knowledgeable and soooo patient .

2	after an exhaustive search for oak_doors we went to the door store .
2	they were great from_start to finish .
2	the doors and workmanship are excellent , the fitter feels_like an old friend now - 00 doors later !
2	they look amazing in our 00th_century cottage .
2	i wouldn_'_t_hesitate to recommend this company
2	my dog is on a special_diet for kidney_disease and the food is cheaper with viovet and the speed of service second to none .
2	i have used groupon on several_occasions for low value items and everything has arrived on time and in perfect_condition .
2	i then ordered a very expensive watch which was to be shipped from germany but only read the reviews on this site once the order was confirmed .
2	i must_admit i was very concerned .
2	the tracking no they gave_me was invalid so i contacted customer_services via_email expecting a long delay before they replied if at all , however i was wrong and they got back to me within a view hours .
2	they provided me with a new tracking no and then i confirmed that the watch would be with me the following_day .
2	it arrived from germany very well_packaged and the product itself is quite outstanding .
2	it is obviously the genuine_article , the manufacturer '_s box is stunning on its own and the watch is way beyond my expectations .
2	i cannot wait for my husband to open it on christmas day .
2	there are so many negative views on this company i felt it only fair to write about my very good experiences with groupon .
2	extremely pleased with my purchased , the quality and speed of despatch was excellent .
2	very good service .
2	i have used cult_pens for sometime_now for both business and personal orders .
2	i am always amazed by the range of pen and pen related items on the site and how quickly my order arrives .
2	would recommend .
2	had experience of hermes twice recently .
2	two parcels from debenhams had not arrived two_weeks after despatch .
2	debenhams eventually sent again , the following_day one of the original parcels arrived ...... looked like it had been transported by canal without using a barge !
2	paperwork inside the bag had completely disintegrated making it v . difficult to return , can only think that hermes had taken so long to deliver as were waiting for it to dry out .
2	i also placed an order on 00th_september with john_lewis for delivery within 0_days .
2	the goods were dispatched by jl on 0st_october with a delivery date of 0th_october .
2	parcel eventually arrived today , nearly a week_later , luckily though this was dry .
2	in both_cases i had paid for this service , or lack of , and i am_disgusted that companies like this can continue to take money under false pretences and because they are contracted by a third_party i cannot take action_against them , only via the retailer .
2	i too will ask suppliers which carriers they use and if the response is " hermes " i will take my business elsewhere in the hope that the retailers will get the message and do the same .
2	very dependable , boxes are carefully_packed full giving more for your money .
2	great selection and a nice treat to have things from " home ".
2	i will use them again and again !
2	would definitely recommend simplygames .
2	the game i ordered was far cheaper_than other shops and internet sites on release day and was despatched quickly .
2	i ordered a photo frame as a gift for a french friend i was delighted when it arrived .
2	i think ludivine will love it and when we have the baby '_s photograph in it wow !
2	brilliant service , arrived promptly and safely .
2	thanks again temptation_gifts .
2	i bought a wowcher for argan hair oil on the 0th_july and i am still_waiting for it , bushlooks the supplier keep_fobbing_me off and wowcher keep_fobbing_me off by asking me for the same info and not actioning it , my next step is trading_standards , but as for you lovely peeps out there dont be hood winked into thinking you have a bargain , its only a bargain if you receive it , more often or not you will lose twice .
2	now i paid 00 , 00 for my wowcher and i have not had a refund or my hair oil , if they do that to everyone buying this product , how much have they made .... loads that how much
2	think about it .............................. an annoyed karen from bridgwater
2	ao . com excellent service they are very helpfull and friendly .
2	i went to another store for my washer_dryer and was told i would have to waite 0 / 0_weeks and pay £_00 for the delivery .
2	so i looked on line and found ao . com and found the item that i wanted i ordered and paid for it on the wednesday and could have it delivered on the friday they text me in the morning to say it would be with me between 00 and 0 so i could go out in the morning and they rang me at 00 to tell me they would be with me in half an_hour they arrived at 00 . 00 great service i will be using this company again and it was free delivery
2	this is a superb online shopping_experience .
2	the goods are lovely , reasonably_priced and spiritual to boot !
2	goods are dispatched very quickly after ordering them , and the parcels when they arrive are well_packaged .
2	the website is clear and simple to use , all in all a pleasant shopping_experience .
2	just one problem , i am spending too much money as i can '_t_resist the goddies !
2	easy to find and good signage south_terminal parking .
2	i usually go from the north_terminal so parking here was new to me .
2	very happy with service and price .
2	the service was great , all the phone_calls were answered quickly and the cso '_s were extremely friendly and polite .
2	the brighton team were excellent great service and lovely people .
2	the actual treatment involved about and hour of delay before i finally got to the treatment room so i was pretty nervous .
2	the actual procedure was ok , not painful although quite unpleasant , but initially i could see pretty well .
2	it did get very sore after about 00_mins but a friend had advised me to go to sleep for a few hours and when i woke_up i could see almost perfectly .
2	it was very exciting .
2	i opted for monovision ie a reading eye and a driving eye and personally i would not recommend this perhaps for me the sacrifice on long vision for reading was too great .
2	disappointingly 0_months after treatment i have suffered some regression and will have to have the procedure repeated as i now require glasses again for driving .
2	i am totally_disgusted with my dealings with scs since mar_0000 when i received delivery of a diablo recliner_chair and sofa which had numerous faults scs said they would order another one which was delivered oct0000 i did not want to accept this suite as the chair was badly_creased and the leather patchy they then sent someone out who used a hairdryer to take out the creases in july_0000 the coating on the leather peeled they wantedto repair the chair i did not want this so i was told to go to trading_standards it has cost me 00 pounds in numerous_calls to them and creation finance who are equally responsible i have paid 00pounds for an independant survey on 00th nov0000 the manufacturer sent a supposedly independant furniture specialist out i am so disgusted by his report he said the peeling is due to contamination in the home the velcro has torn the material away on the arms the said the arms had been moved this caused it only their upholsterers moved them screws have come out on both settee and chair my husband and i are pensioners and cannot_afford another suite and feel humiliated and let_down by scs
2	lovely freindly staff
2	i used photo_world because there was a voucher_code on the mse website .
2	i '_ve bought calendars from other_companies before as christmas_presents for family_members .
2	these are by far the worse quality and were no cheaper_than any other company .
2	the paper feels poor quality in comparison and no info on public holidays etc on each_month
2	wouldn_'_t use them again .
2	ordered some applaws puppy and naturediet which came pretty quick and got frequent_updates of delivery status including being_able to track driver on the day .
2	also got texts where i could opt for neighbour delivery or another day .
2	would definitely use again .
2	booking made easily , but i was surprised when the payment was taken .
2	not clear that extra_charges were added , sms confirmation , cancellation_cover plus booking_fee
2	our recent return transfers in gran_canaria were excellent .
2	friendly , professional service throughout , at an great price .
2	excellent drivers .
2	loved the fact that we received a text_message a couple of days before our return , to confirm pick_up time etc .

2	if money you would save ,
2	i know where to trim the fat
2	off items that we crave !
2	from gadgets through to jewellery ,
2	the list_goes on and on ,
2	the prices plummet till they see
2	their present stock '_s all gone !
2	other people stare amazed
2	to see the prices there
2	that '_s why wowcher `_s highly praised
2	consider what you '_d pay elsewhere !
2	it '_s frightening when you think !
2	price - drop - firms , just don_'_t care ,
2	they let the prices sink !
2	yes , my home '_s now full of bargains ,
2	they ' re there in every room ...
2	the money saved just simply stuns ,

2	each time you watch price - drop
2	keep other folks in mind !
2	i '_ve saved a fortune every year ,

2	i boast bargains that astound !
2	elizabeth davies

2	you will be happy though as they are so good !
2	i made an_error when choosing my lenses and they changed them with absolutely no_fuss !

2	interestingly , i had no real problems with scottish_power while my account was open with tme .
2	my problems have been in trying to shake off their persitent correspondence with me after i left them .
2	i closed my account with scottish_power in august and have been receiving e_-_mails ( all headed , erroneously , ' an important communication from scottishpower ') from them at the rate of two or three a month ever_since .
2	i have made umpteen attempts to get them to stop sending them , but with no success .
2	here is one response i received from them ( complete with typo ):
2	' we have close your account on 00 august_0000 .
2	the e_- mail which you have received is an_automated e_- mail we sent to all of our customers .
2	please ignore the automated e_- mail .'
2	it is impossible to get them to understand that i am not a customer .
2	i change my energy_supplier regularly , but i have to say that , next time i use a comparison site , even if scottish_power comes out top , i will not switch to them .
2	be aware that by signing_up to this company , you are signing_up for spam e_- mail messages for ( it seems ) the rest of your life .
2	either the company cannot control its automated_systems , or , more likely , it just cannot be bothered to do so .
2	i was looking for a source of reasonably_priced venchi chocolate cigars as a little extra christmas_present for my husband and stumbled on this site .

2	i would like my money back but cant get_hold of them as they dont answer my emails and dont pick_up the phone .
2	i believe they used to be a good company but obviously having problems at the moment and im hugely_disappointed .

2	my husband managed to mislay one of the black covers before he put the sign up , & a quick email to the company resulted_in one being put in the post , so that '_s what i call customer service .

2	rentalcars seems to operates through agents or one agent - and it is unclear at time of booking which agent will be supplying your car .
2	there is no desk in the airport building at malaga for rentalcars . com and no clear_indication of where to find their representative .
2	i followed the airport signs for rental_cars to an exit where there was no rep and i did not know at that time that i would be getting my car from centauro .
2	you only know that once you have found the rentalcars rep who on this day was standing at another exit .
2	i was on my own and distracted trying to find the car_rental that i had booked in_advance and in those few_minutes was robbed of my mobile and credit_cards !
2	having dealt_with this fiasco / minor disaster , i returned to the airport with a translator supplied by the authorities and , by_accident , came_across the rep - hours_later than should have been the case .
2	once pointed to centauro the service was excellent and the car could not be_faulted .
2	great drop_off arrangements at alicante - all clearly signed to centauro '_s office .
2	i am returning to spain in a few_weeks and will try centauro direct .

2	thanks again hen_heaven we all had a ball xx
2	i worked for a distribution company for over 0 years ... you all beat the wholesale price by a long_shot
2	i was fed_up of buying poor quality hair_accessories that did nothing for my hair and broke in next to no time .
2	i found stone_bridge and was a little_concerned_about the prices , but contacted melissa for some advice , and i got personal advice about suitable accessories for my very awkward hair .
2	since then i have been a regular customer , and without_exception the order process , delivery and items have been without fault .
2	an exceptional company , with a responsive customer service ethos .
2	i use premier_inn a lot and find the rooms , staff and food excellent .
2	i stay in the same one each_month for work and the staff are always helpful and friendly , the rooms are very big with the most amazing shower_cubicle that i i don_'_t want to get out of !
2	evening_meal and breakfast are excellent with a wide_variety to cover all tastes .
2	awful_awful_awful !!!
2	smashed my parcel to pieces and then said i can '_t claim as my dinner service was an ' excluded item '.
2	going through the courts now !
2	i will never use them or a company that uses this bunch of incompetent morons .
2	yes they are cheap but there is a reason they are cheap , i '_d rather pay the extra and get the item in one piece !
2	!
2	there is a massive_selection of clothes in all sizes for male and female along with household goods .
2	delivery is quick and courier can also pick_up returns from your house .
2	easy to open an account and although it is a low credit_limit to begin with i am hoping it increases quickly but as i have only had the account a short time i have yet to experience an increase .
2	you can view your account online and it is clear and easy to understand .
2	email are answered quickly but i think they are answered by an indian_call_centre so most of the answers are generic so if you want a more specific answer i would suggest calling .
2	overall they are a great company .
2	i did the free home_trial and found a pair i liked , then i got an_email for £_00 so it made the price of the glasses i wanted so much_better so i ordered them and even with the xmas holiday they still arrived really quickly .
2	perfect glasses that fit well
2	good selection of products , keen prices .
2	postage free so big bonus .
2	goods arrived within a couple of days on std service .
2	web_site was easy to use .
2	great site , well_organised and easy to order ,
2	i have no idea about the 0_* reviews re this company - i do know a good few people they have ripped_off , what i '_d say about my experience is that i read the small_print , they don_'_t insure iphones purchased outside the uk , well guess_what i ordered my on line from the official_iphone store and my phone was shipped from southern_ireland , so when i queried this with protect my bubble they eventually fessed up that they would not insure the phone , they only told me this after a good 0_weeks of trying to get some sort of sense out of them and they took_ages refunding my money , so if you did not get your phone in the uk , check the smallprint , you probably are not covered .
2	i note the response from protect your bubble below is very prompt whereas when i asked a very straightforward question about the insurance_policy no one could answer the q , which was " my phone was purchase from the official apple_store and was shipped from sth ireland a non eu country so am i covered " ...
2	protect yr bubble were unable to give me an answer at the time for weeks , interesting that on this website they answer politely and promptly ,,, cos they certainly were incapable last time , ...
2	order arrived promptly and were as_described and looked on line , sizing was generous , easy ordering and returns , all in all will order more boo_hoo goodies , offers also are very good , my order was free pp as well as free_returns , lots of lovely clothes to choose from too , and good quality , what '_s not to like
2	i buy my cat wormers and flea_treatments from medicanimal , by doing this i can choose just to purchase a couple of worm pills or more , also a good range of flea_treatments , good descriptions of the products available and much_cheaper_than going to the pet_shops or super_markets , prompt service too , i like to browse and have choice and this web_site is ideal ,
2	the perfect finishing_touch to our beautiful new home .
2	the service & quality of work , by far , exceeded our expectations .
2	thank_you so much rustic_stone
2	went on the go_electrical site , found the mixer i wanted , ordered it , completed order on phone as slight_hitch online .
2	got confirmation_email .
2	a day or so later , had email from carrier telling_me delivery date .
2	on delivery date , had email specifying the one hour time_slot they would be delivering in and true to their_word , it arrived !
2	lovely piece of equipment , can '_t wait to try it out !
2	free knife_set did not arrive at same time but was assured this would follow in new year which i have no_doubt that it will .
2	first_class service .
2	can thoroughly_recommend this service , brilliant especially for early morning flights .
2	cost is only a little above normal car_parking but with no_hassle & a warmed_up car for driving home :)
2	lovely runner , fits_perfectly , excellent price , looking to buy more from the rug_house .
2	thank_you : )
2	excellent service , goods competitively_priced , fast delivery .
2	no_probs
2	well , having taken up the bogof deal on frames over_£_00 i was expecting to wait a while to get the specs .
2	i anticipated that many people would have picked_up on such a good deal and therefore , i would have to be patient .
2	not so !
2	the quickest turnaround i '_ve ever had , both_pairs arrived within a week .
2	stunned at the speed , i then expected there to be a problem - no problem !
2	what can i say other than a brilliant service with outstanding quality , buy from these_guys , they know what they ' re doing !
2	thanks to petmeds i get my cats treatments cheaper_than the vet and always when promised .
2	this company just keeps getting better .
2	never had an issue , timely and correct every time .
2	ordering was easy via the website , and delivery was really fast .
2	the glass_jars were all very well_wrapped to prevent_damage .
2	easy to use website .
2	we have used printerland for some years , and continue to do so because we get extremely prompt delivery of whatever we order , at all times of the year even in the week or two before christmas .
2	consumable items are out of stock very rarely ie we can_rely_on printerland to have what we need and to send it straight_away .
2	their service is first_class , as is the range of products .
2	i '_ve been looking for a long time for something to help make my sitting easier .
2	having just come out of hospital and they were so generous in giving me bedsores , getting comfortable has_been a challenge .
2	then i just googled pressure cushions and physio_supplies ltd was the first result i look at .
2	i continued to look at the other results but none of them matched what i already found on physio_supplies ltd .
2	the product description was clear and concise so i placed my order and as it was over the weekend i expected my delivery might have been delayed .
2	not the case i am delighted to say , it came within_00hrs of ordering .
2	now i can sit in complete comfort and thanks to physio_supplies ltd it is now an enjoyable_experience .
2	thank_you for giving me a first_class service that i will remember and have no_hesitation in referring to others .
2	wow , i ordered my products and because i am a returning_customer got a discount whch is always a nice_touch .
2	speedy delivery as they came the very next_day .
2	i am extremely pleased with my order and would gladly_recommend it to everyone i know and to anyone who is looking for products that actually help make life much_easier !
2	hired a car for a long weekend so booked a cheap , small car , was very pleased to have a bigger upgrade on arrival at airport , efficient staff on desk , and was on my way quickly with no_fuss , very good holiday_autos , will use again
2	attempted to open current account and told account live but couldn_'_t access it because security code never came - impossible to speak to anyone without the code - local_branch was less_than useless - wrote 0 letters without a reply from enayone even their customer_services manager - eventually got email address for ceo [ last one ] and sent him an_email - then got contacted by someone on his behalf who hadn_'_t a clue - eventyually managed to disengage completly and withdraw funds - not a happy experience at all . would never use them again - no confidence in an organisation that is so so impersonal
2	i have purchased a number of items from mbp and on each_occasion have found them courteous , knowledgeable and friendly .
2	everything has_been exactly as_described and promptly despatched .
2	after sales service has also been excellent .
2	i will always recommend people to look at their webiste when looking for equipment and hope to continue purchasing from them in years to come

2	very good service and excellent prices .
2	will use again and recommend to friends .
2	i purchased the blow_up cushion seat for my bath to help my dad .
2	he has not had a bath in years has always had to have a shower .
2	this cushions which is powered by a small battery_operated pump will blow_up inside the bath to the desired height , allowing my dad to sit on it , and be lowered into the bath .
2	you can then blow it up again to allow ease of getting out .
2	he_loves it , i love it .
2	thank_you careco for showing me how it works .
2	what a wonderful thing .
2	my new tanks look brilliant , hope they are as good as the write up .
2	recently had some leaflets printed by flyerzone .
2	very easy to edit the templates online .
2	prices were much_better_than previous things i have had printed and i was able to work on the words and pictures side of things in my own time and in the comfort of my home , take as long as i wanted to get it right before ordering will definitely use again
2	we ordered a glass coffee_table and nest of 0 glass_tables online and they came within 00_hours .
2	they are very reasonably_priced and were packaged superbly .
2	friends have admired them and i '_ve not hesitated to give them details of where to buy .
2	faultless service .
2	i don_'_t think i '_ll ever pay " supermarket " prices for batteries again !
2	great value
2	i love my new loaf mattress , however it '_s taking time for my back to settle into it .
2	i am wondering_if maybe i should have gone for an extra firm but i '_m_sure it '_s just teething_problems as i have on going issue '_s with my back which can flare up at anytime .
2	i am sleeping really well tho and having the extra room going from a double to a kingsize is so nice .
2	thanks for amazing service .
2	when ordering online the goods arrive quickly & have always been correct .
2	well_done debenhams !
2	!

2	i have used this site for years & ordered many items .
2	apart_from 0 occasion delivery has_been within 0_days , much sooner_than promised .
2	in the unlikely_event of having to return items the procedure is efficient & postage is paid .
2	i have no_hesitation in recommending this site .
2	i have been a member for years , there are only 0 of us in our house but the points soon add up .
2	i always choose debenhams vouchers & love to go & spend them , feels_like your getting something for nothing !
2	!
2	i regularly buy tickets through double0_tickets as i know that i will always get the seats i want in a great position .
2	the service is fantastic , they are very reliable .
2	phoned for advice before placing order for headphones ... very clear and helpful advice
2	ordering online was very straightforward and delivery was very speedy
2	headphones are excellent
2	many_thanks
2	bought six .
2	baby boa constrictors to share with arthritic friends at half thepriceanywhere else on net .
2	rapid checkout .
2	rapid service .
2	phones answered quickly by friendly staff .
2	excellent company .
2	mrs page
2	we used screwfix for all our bathroom_fittings , plus radiators for house and umpteen other stuff .
2	very good quality particularly their steel enamel baths .
2	brilliant service and helpful staff .
2	food wine and electrical bargains brilliant and cheap cheap cheap but they buck pass if a fault develops , so a bit_iffy for computers , cameras etc , might need to regard as a write off if they go_wrong .
2	being_able to store all my pics on line is brilliant and address book so if computer fizzles out have not lost any stuff
2	fantastic company .
2	last_year my delivery value over_£_000 disappeared en_route and it was replaced with no_hassle .
2	so shopped again this year .
2	amazing value and excellent quality .
2	the silk throw is genuine silk and really really thick not like another company who shall be nameless at double the price .
2	the essential towels - budget range - so good that my husband who never notices such things actually commented on them .
2	i love this company and the delivery charges now are so reasonable .
2	have stopped shopping with some companies as it can run to nearly_£_00 to buy and then return poor goods .
2	no poor goods with this company .
2	no i don_'_t have shares but i do know value as a wartime child .
2	mrs page
2	a great weekend was had by all .
2	hotel excellent with great views of the shard and a brilliant full english_breakfast .
2	it was in a great location for the tower of london .
2	we had great tickets for the theatre and was even upgraded on the day .
2	everything went to plan brilliantly .
2	will be booking our next trip without_hesitation through ticket_tree .
2	i have bought several different vitamin tables from simply_supplements as they are very much_cheaper_than in any shop and they are delivered very speedily after ordering .
2	click were the most reasonably_priced transfers .
2	we had no_problems_whatsoever with their service and were very fortunate that we were the only 0 passengers so that we went directly to our destination .
2	we will undoubtedly use them on our next trip_abroad and will recommend them to friends .
2	tempted yet again by debenhams " too good to be true " reductions & despite them failing to fulfill previous_orders , i ordered some joseph joseph cookware .
2	yet again the delivery didn_'_t materialise , yet again debenhams say that they are now out of stock & will issue a refund - after holding on to my payment for up to 00 days .
2	how much are they making in interest on all this customer cash they hold on to for two_weeks at a time ?
2	is it legal for them to do this ?
2	is debenhams just an elaborate money laundering scheme ?
2	when i tried to insist they supply my goods , i was told " debenhams are too_big to worry_about one small order ".
2	this was the final_straw - i now boycott their fraudulent store and unspeakably rude staff .
2	my first order could have gone very badly due to the main item being out of stock & the courier delivering a day late , but as each problem cropped up i was contacted promptly by a member of staff with alternatives or solutions .
2	it was such a refreshing_change to speak to people who weren_'_t just making_excuses or reading from a corporate script , but were intelligent , friendly & well informed .
2	when the limited_edition single_malt was out of stock , the girl who rang had a list of realistic alternatives prepared , making the order change completely_painless .
2	when citylink failed to deliver & turned their phones off , the guy i spoke to took complete ownership of the problem & called me back with updates - despite having the same ways of contacting citylink as i did .
2	the whole exprience left me with a pleasantly warm feeling , although not as pleasantly warm as the feeling the excellent & reasonably_priced single_malt left !
2	i will_definately be shopping here again & recommending them to all my pals .
2	since_starting to use this website service - i have had excellent service - the bags for returning the telephones and the cheque payment have always arrived very quickly .
2	cannot find any fault at all in this service at all
2	i first used yumega_oil for my gsd who has sebacious adenitis .
2	it cleared up in a few_weeks , and as it '_s chronic , i have given her yumega_oil ( now yumega_plus ) ever_since .
2	she has had no further problems with her skin .
2	she also gets yumove , as she '_s quite elderly and has a few other mobility_issues going on .
2	i have recently begun to also give it to my lurcher who has recovered from a badly broken leg but is now at risk for developing arthritis at the site of the break .
2	so far no_problems .
2	i '_ve also tried some of the collodial silver products for eye and tooth health , and have found them to be very good .
2	i have always experienced prompt and accurate service when ordering from the lintbells website .
2	all in all i think lintbells produces excellent products and provides equally good customer service .
2	prices are low and service fast .
2	it '_s easy to order and pay .
2	i have never had any_problems with my orders .
2	five_star firm !
2	linda hardy
2	booked our hol through holidaysplease and were very satisfied with the ease and personal service provided .
2	very friendly advice and didn_'_t have to do any legwork !
2	would definately recommend them to anyone !
2	serenata_flowers have top quality flowers at great prices and their delivery is fast and on time , thats_why i wouldnt go any where else .
2	flashbay '_s mark_williams looked after our company needs and provided an excellent service from_start to finish .
2	i would highly_recommend using flashbay .
2	whenever i look on ebookers i am never disappointed .
2	this is the second time i have booked my flights with them .
2	non_stop flights at a great price .
2	i have already_recommended them to family and friends .
2	i have been ordering my drinks from this company on a regular_basis now .
2	the prices are competitive , and ordering is quick and easy , delivery within a couple of days , and kept_informed_throughout , why go_anywhere_else .
2	the whiskey_exchange ticks_all my boxes .
2	exactly_what i wanted .
2	fits over my boots like a glove .

2	received it in a couple of days .
2	will_definately be using clickforgames again .

2	would use again and recommend .
2	very friendly helper ( sarah_hayes ).
2	excellent service and very easy to use on - line system .
2	well , having read_reviews about this company and also being a little_apprehensive as to the fact that they were located in hong_kong , i went_ahead anyway and ordered the panasonic_lumix lx0 as although i am nearly 00 years old , i really wanted to get a fairly decent camera to take on holiday to mexico in a few_weeks , and reading the reviews of this camera , decided to order it from digitalrev . com as the price was extremely cheap !
2	i placed the order and waited , but for a couple of days nothing changed
2	luckily they have livechat so i waited to make_sure they would be there as there is a time difference , and i had ordered it successfully but it was the chinese new year so no one was there for a few_days :)
2	the person i spoke to ensured me it was being dispatched that day as they had returned to work , and here is a summary of the shipping .... in reverse order of course :)

2	its a shame that no bbs were in stock when ordering as i would have got some of these too , but i will grab some from the model shop later and get my air targets out of the cupboard as well .....
2	i cant_wait lol
2	go on .... buy one ..... you know you want to !

2	excellent company to deal with .
2	goods always arrive promptly and they even honour their price promise on their own website when items reduced a few_days after purchasing .
2	great customer service .
2	would definitely recommend using them .
2	tyres arrived from abroad when promised and fitting was prompt and professional .
2	great customer service - i was kept_informed every_step of the way .
2	will definitely use event_tyres next time !
2	been using them over a year now for my dog '_s monthly meds and they '_ve never let_me down .
2	good prices & selection , great service and excellent delivery times !
2	ordered rug on friday and recieved it on wednesday excellent value for money wish i '_d ordered two .
2	i '_m the envy of all my friends .
2	i ordered 0 plugs at 0 . 00pm and they were delivered 0 . 00am the following_day .
2	great service and price was excellent .
2	would not_hesitate to use faculty_- x again .
2	very pleased with service and product .
2	i was after a specific thermarest mattress , lucy very kindly went to their warehouse to make_sure that the ones they had in stock were the ones i wanted , and lo and behold they were on my doorstep 0_days_later .
2	this is the first time i have used this company but based on this experience i would definitely use them again .
2	i like it when i get ordered items in one package rather_than receiving them in dribs and drabs .
2	nicely_packed , quick delivery .
2	what '_s not to like ???
2	?
2	i '_m delighted with my purchases - two aran sweaters .
2	after trying on the first one i ordered i simply had to have a second one .
2	i '_m getting ready for the winter_months , as i am always cold wearing man - made yarn sweaters .
2	there '_s nothing to beat a real wool sweater .
2	private_kilimanjaro arranged our trip of a lifetime , climbing mt kilimanjaro with 0 of my 0 children !
2	we started aug 00st 0000 and successfully sumitted on sept 0th at 0 . 00am .
2	we had wonderful guides ; august , sebby & livvy , plus 00 fantastic porters & sistos our catering manager .
2	i must have called paul deakin of pk most days with more questions and queries - he never once indicated he was fed_up with my questions !
2	a perfect team for a perfect trip , without their guideance it would never have been such a success !
2	we started at machame gate and booked the 0day route , we managed well and kept very focussed the entire time as joseph was only 00yrs_old !
2	go for it & never give up - they are an inspiring and motivational team .
2	i will never forget the thrills along the way nor the difficult parts as i had never camped out in my life !
2	it was all very manageable indeed and it was not just a question of being fit or having all the kit as to having the correct determined ' mind set '.
2	we can - we will - we chanted for most of the way .
2	i can say that experiencing this achievement with my children made it the most memorable 0_days of my life .
2	we raised over_£ 00k for the chain of hope children '_s charity which made the trip so worthwhile and not just a bit of personal indulgement !
2	good luck if you decide to take on the adventure .... it will be well_worth it .
2	i am looking_forward to trying the himalayas in the next few_years , probably alone , as it may be a more spiritual climb !
2	i found this form of faxing ideal as i use e_- mail regularly but do not have a fax_machine and my friend in australia only ever uses fax , was not computerised , did not use e_- mail and was adament that she was never going to use anything " new fangled " such as a computer or e_- mail !
2	i therefore send her a fax which leaves me as an attachment to an e_- mail , en_route it get converted and she_receives it as a normal fax on the fax_machine her end .
2	she then faxes a reply to me from her fax_machine which again magically gets converted en_route to arrive as an attachment to an e_- mail my end .
2	what more could anyone ask , absolutely_brilliant .
2	it was delivered so quickly so impressed thank_you
2	i found the website through a google_search , and thought i would give it a go .
2	the web_site was very easy to use and i was able to quickly price up a large blind to know it was within my budget .
2	i ordered samples that arrived very promptly in a snazzy envelope .
2	they were big enough to make an informed_decision to be made .
2	ordering was simple .
2	i did so on a saturday late_afternoon and on the wednesday i have an_email_saying it had been dispatched .
2	it was with me friday_morning .
2	well_wrapped and with fitting_instructions .
2	the brackets are metal , not like the plastic ones you get from a certain high_street catalogue retailer .
2	my only_gripe , which is a small one is that countersunk style screws were provided which clearly don_'_t work when trying to tighten up to a flat plate .
2	a nice dome headed screw would be much more aesthetically_pleasing and would also work better .
2	if i want another blind i will use again and will certainly tell my friends .
2	this is the second time we have ordered organic wheatgrass from indigo_herbs .
2	the first time it arrived very quickly .
2	this time it took almost a week , as it the christmas postal rush seems to have started already ( mid november ) .
2	we are recommending it to all our friends , as it has helped my husband feel calmer and have more energy .
2	even his hair is thicker around his semi - bald patch !
2	i don_'_t like the taste , so am not taking it myself though .
2	the car was met quickly , we didn_'_t have to wait long . the driver was courteous and efficient . the same for the return . would definitely use again and recommend .
2	fantastic invention .
2	i even got my hubby on to them .
2	& he has smoked for many a year .
2	just hope the government dont get their hands on it .
2	excellent service & delivery times .
2	& im so glad i did .
2	the prices for my cleaning products are absolutely_brilliant .
2	i saved £. s on my usual shopping .
2	i will recommend chemist_direct to anyone & all .
2	& delivery time was exceptional .
2	i ordered my cleaning products on saturday_afternoon .
2	& i got them on tuesday_morning .
2	well_done .
2	i used them for airport transfer .
2	i am very pleased with the service .
2	everything went_smoothly from the word go .
2	these_guys are true to their_word .
2	they know their job and got on with it .
2	they got our appointment and supported us and even bought us coffee !!
2	( thank_you ali !)
2	i can only but recommend these imperial_visas to help with any visa problem or issue .
2	they are just the best in the world .
2	i had two tyres_fitted to my vehicle today and made the mistake of paying cash for them .
2	i made a mistake and gave the fitter £_000 too much as i had got so many quotes and prices before_settling on event_tyres .
2	when the fitter had finished i just gave him the bundle of cash , thinking it was the correct amount and he left , as soon as i realised my mistake i called him but surprise_surprise he insisted i had given him the right money !!
2	i even called him back to appeal to his better nature and ' double_check ' the money he had .... whereupon he stated he had told me already and that he had already told his_boss .... i bet he had !!!!
2	!
2	i understand this was my mistake but as a single mother not being_able to afford to lose this sort of money i feel sick to my stomach that someone could be this dishonest .
2	for this reasin i will never use this company again and would warn_others who pay cash to be very careful .
2	athough my son '_s prom is a few_months off , i purchased the full package - tuxedo , shirt , bow_tie and cummerbun at the end of january_0000 .
2	this was received the next_day ( although ordered on the 0 day free_postage ) so was impressed with the seed of the delivery .
2	the tuxedo was excellent value for money and good quality .
2	i even returned the trousers for a bigger_size and the service was just as fast and efficient .
2	would certainly recommend this company for value for money and service .
2	thanks
2	i bought a frying_pan because mine had lost its non_stick .
2	i found pro_cooks website and found exactly_what i was looking for .
2	the pan arrived quickly .
2	i have used it already and i am very pleased its good quality pan for less_than £_00 including delivery .
2	well_worth it .
2	i puchased a pen some time ago from mr pen and rang last_week to get advice on how to get it working again .
2	the man i spoke to was so curteous and proffesional and offered to clean it free of charge if i posted it to him .
2	what a service .
2	i also purchased some refills and ink_cartridges these were dispatched within two_days and were value for money and the quality is second to none .
2	will use this company every time i need pens or sundries .
2	i ordered medication for my dog on 00th_september and was informed that the medication had shipped on 00th_september .
2	i had to contact the company today and was informed that the medication had not been shipped because my payment had failed .
2	at no point did they try to contact me even_though they said they had rang me at home and left a message which i never received .
2	i am angry that i as the customer had to follow this up .
2	my dog needs her medicine urgently .
2	not impressed and will be looking for another company in the future .
2	i was looking to stock up on fronline flea_treatment and drontal dog_wormer tablets .
2	this company offered the best value that i could find , and with free delivery .
2	very well made voiles , nicely weighted .
2	i would use this company again and recommend to family and friends .
2	my order was with me within 00_hours , and very well_packaged .
2	the price was very competitve ... altogether excellent service .
2	i first started_using tesco when i was sixteen ( now sixty nine ) when it was a tiny shop in george lane south woodford e00 .
2	wherever i have moved to over the ensuing years my first priority was to locate my local_store .
2	i have always received excellent service be it in store , on line , banking or insurance .
2	am i a tesco fanatic ?
2	yes !!!
2	!
2	always avoided using ' the net ' ( wrong generation ) but despite a tentative start i now find it both an enjoyable and informative experience on this easy to use site - age no barrier !
2	i have never_experienced anything other than quality service since i started_using amazon three years_ago
2	as usual i received a first_rate service from viovet and the prices are more than competative
2	i have just spent the best part of a whole evening dealing_with shockingly rude and bullying customer service representatives .
2	first i was called by " karen from updates " who proceeded to make me a liar by disputing my airtime allowance , despite my reading it off my signed contract .
2	i asked to escalate this to a senior_manager and was called two hours_later by michelle , who was equally rude and despite my having in black and white a contract , despite my offering to give the contact details of the carphone_warehouse senior_manager who had sanctioned the contract , i was refused any inquiry or investigation .
2	is this really what everything everywhere , t mobile '_s ultimate boss - ceo olaf swantee , want his customers to feel ( sickened and angry ) doing_business with his company ?
2	this is behaviour one would expect from a criminal gang and not one of the largest mobile companies in the world .
2	this is definitely a case for cisas .
2	stupendously bad and a horrible_experience !
2	the product arrived in the correct packing ( well in date ) .
2	certainly will use again
2	i ordered a wormer for the cat .
2	the quality was the same as offered by the vet but at a much_better price .
2	arrived within a few_days .
2	will certainly use again
2	ordered sdhc card for camera - yet to use but service very good and as_described
2	surprised that the vac is so powerful when it was emptied - surpised at how much dust was inside ..
2	i have used serenataa few_times , easty to use web_site with good descriptions .
2	good availablility of delivery times which they stick to .
2	i love getting the texts_telling_me when the flowers are on their way and when they have been delivered .
2	all my friends have loved the flowers , pretty , very long_lasting and have asked me where i have got tehm from .
2	try serenata , you won_'_t be disappointed !
2	!
2	what ever purchased brill stuff .
2	delivered quickly and when i want it .
2	address needs to be corrected though !
2	the delivery was first_class .
2	not only was there a text on when it was going to be delivered but the time as well .
2	thank for customer service if only other_companies where as thoughtful .
2	who has time to price shop at the literally_hundreds of sites out there ?
2	sw will not only meet , but beat all prices , and are great to deal with .
2	ordered two new tyres on line , received a phone_call to confirm , next_day andy turned_up on time to fit them .
2	me being female knows nothing about tyres but andy explained what had happened to the wear on the old tyres and how to look after the new ones and the correct psi to put in .
2	hope all your technicians are as polite and helpful as andy because i '_m certainly going to use you in the future .
2	having just bought an apartment in cyprus , we were looking to ship 0 large crates of household goods over from the uk .
2	having looked at the major carriers websites & ruled them out due to the expense we then seemed to falls between 0 stools , not having enough for overseas removals firms but too much for regular parcel post .
2	saw the reviews for parcelhero on a cyprus forum & decided to give them a go , but was very apprehensive that our stuff would disappear into the back of a white van never to be seen again .
2	i needn_'_t have worried , the ordering process was very easy & the labeling guidelines nice & clear .
2	a fedex van turned_up promptly on the day i specified & i was able to track the location of our crates online evrey step of the way .
2	best of all everything arrived safe & sound in half the time expected despite only paying for the economy service .
2	cost was half what i would have paid if i '_d booked direct with fedex .
2	wouldn_'_t_hesitate to use parcelhero again .
2	brilliant .
2	arrived next_day .
2	easy to use and upload .
2	much more choice than the competition .
2	will definitely use in future and would recommend .
2	would be good if maybe a discount for a multiple order though !
2	exactly as it looked on the website .
2	good quality .
2	the ribbons at the front make it very easy to adjust as do the ties on the skirt .
2	very pleased
2	i have always used serenata since i received the 00 white_roses arrangement from friends a few_years_ago .

2	first time user , sending a parcel to australia , with fedex .
2	customer service were very patient with me and answered everything .
2	booking the transaction was painless .
2	collection was at a reasonable time - though the driver had not been given my full address / postcode !.
2	arrival in australia was within the time frame given and the parcel didn_'_t look as if it had travelled across the world brilliant .
2	this was the first time shopping at julesb on line and i must_say what an excellent shopping_experience , it is just great when the correct item arrives , very neatly , expertly and safely_packaged and delivered promptly .

2	it was very easy to find what i wanted , the price was good and it got here fast .
2	very competitively_priced for a genuine product .
2	i was given very fair prices for a breitling and a rolex which i used in part exchange for an omega planet ocean which i love !
2	they also managed to source this watch far sooner_than they originally thought !
2	tom and james were a pleasure to do_business with and i would highly_recommend their services !
2	i think these porters were exceptional .
2	they were so professional , and polite and friendly i would recommend them thoroughly .
2	they brought the furniture in , and placed it in the room where it was required , and even ( for a small additional_fee ) took away the old table and chairs which was a real_bonus in my opinion .
2	fantastic - very happy customers
2	ive bought various products from electric toothbrushes to incontinence pads .
2	the items have always arrived quickly , and in good order .
2	i '_ve always been very happy with the service i '_ve received , and the prices have always been lower_than the high_street even including the delivery charge .
2	i will shop_here again .
2	after_searching on line for a transfer from faro_airport to our accomodation in vilamoura , i chose suntransfers because of the price and the reviews .

2	pauline - edinburgh
2	met at igassu falls airport told by driver that he had had heart_operation so couldn_'_t lift our_luggage and didn_'_t even open the car door , paid for transfer to das cataratas hotel reception but dropped_off at entrance to the national park , told we had to buy entry ticket then catch the hotel shuttle , nothing about this on their website or confirmation_email , took my money for a few_minutes journey , when asked for a refund , had a nice reply that they would investigate and get back to me , that was 00 days ago and heard_nothing since , save your money and just get a taxi at the airport !
2	placed my order 0_days ago nothing has arrived - no correspondence to explain this & can '_t get through on the phone !
2	would expect a phone_call or email if a problem .
2	went with this company because quick delivery boasted on website - and clearly care supplies are always needed quickly .
2	i really needed to find some beefy chaps to pick_up a conservatory from a private house which i recently_purchased .
2	i simply put what i wanted to be picked_up , where i wanted it delivered to and waited for the quotes .
2	i was able to see what type of transport they used and how many people would be involved , this was important due to the size of items .
2	i did not choose the cheapest but the most suitable for my needs .
2	this site allowed me to do this easily .
2	i certainly would use it again in the future and mention it to my friends .
2	good value with problem free service .
2	quickly dispatched butt allow a day or longer as ships from chanel islands .
2	would definitely recommend .
2	card left on 00th and on same day i arranged redelivery online for 00th .
2	request ignored by parceforce and my parcel taken to a post_office ( not local ) in a ' shady area ' .
2	i work out of town getting home after po closed so advised customer_services of my limited_availability to wait in at home on numerous_occasions all ignored with parcelforce attempting redelivery again on a day when i was at work ..
2	given a phone number of local_depot to resolve by customer_services .
2	all email as this is only source of contact .
2	this number was an_automated redelivery service requesting £_00 to redeliver on a saturday as i am now out of town on a weekday for next 00 days .
2	needless to say i have now given up and asked sender to make a claim for an undelivered parcel .
2	just too much time_consuming hassle and still no parcel .
2	it was a bit_risky ordering prescription glasses online for the first time but they are perfect .
2	in fact i had resigned_myself to putting up with whatever arrived but i couldn_'_t have chosen better or been more happy with the purchase if i had bought it from a high_street optician - better value too !
2	excellent service competitive_prices nothing to much_trouble definitely use in the future
2	i order insulin for my dog for which i need a prescription from the vet .
2	it is almost_half the price that i would have to pay if i got it from my vet ., although i have to pay £_00 . 00 for a prescription , it is well_worth it for a large order .
2	it arrives next_day and is still cold because of the ice_packs in the packaging .
2	other items such as syringes , diastix etc_., are also cheaper_than what the vet_charges and everything is well_packaged .
2	i would thoroughly_recommend this company .
2	we got our breasly memory_foam mattresses 0_weeks earlier_than_expected .
2	two young delivery man were so kind to bring mattresses to the 0th_floor as our lift was broken .
2	mattresses are perfectly comfortable and very good quality .
2	my daughter doesn_'_t get up at night with the scary dreams any more .
2	my husband '_s back and neck_pain disappeared within few_days .
2	we are very happy with the purchase .
2	best ever shopping on line : i have ordered food for my kitten in the afternoon and received it the next_morning .
2	excellent !!
2	!
2	excellent service and fast delivery : ordered food for my kitten on thursday_afternoon and received on saturday_morning .
2	great prices , good recomendations .
2	easy to order , fast delived .
2	so much_easier that buying from a shop .
2	i have an art_group in seahouses , northumberland and find the saa most helpful . i recommend all my new members to join in order to get their art_materials at a good price and lots of advice when needed .
2	love it .. it was for my beach hut .. now must think of a name for my house so i can get another one done
2	[_name_] was my ' helper ' whilst making enquiries about the services of parcel0go .
2	he / she was very helpful , quick and polite .
2	i will use parcel0go again !
2	ever_since orange joined with ee my service has_been rubbish even the customer service used to be really good , now your treated like dirt ,
2	i '_ve been with orange 00 years or more and never had a problem , previously when my contract has_been up for renewal they have rung me to ask about phones and plans , not anymore ,
2	over the last few_months my bills have been massive so i decided when my contract was up for renewal that i would try somewhere_else , when i rang to disconnect the customer rep told me i had to give 0_months notice even_though my contract was over ...
2	.
2	i like most people i '_m a busy person and completely forgot the date of the disconnection which happened to be today 00 / 00 / 00 0am ,
2	as you can_imagine i thought my phone had a fault at first ......
2	when i realised it had been disconnected i rang a rep and asked for the pac_number to transfer my phone number to a new provider after all it had only been a couple of hours after disconnection ......
2	0 phone_calls to 0 different reps i gave up and got a pay as you go sim to see me through the day
2	as soon as i got home i looked for the letter and disconnection date which was today .... but the letter clearly_states that if i decided to return up to six_months down the line i can have my old number back , so why the bleepin bleep cant i have it now ??
2	?
2	early last_year ( more than 00 months_ago ), i bought a piano_stool .
2	one leg broke , and i emailed gear0music ( july_0000 ) to ask whether it was possible for me to buy a replacement leg .
2	i did not expect the reply i received ( within 00_hours !
2	), telling_me that a replacement leg had been dispatched !
2	it arrived , again within 00_hours of that email , free of charge !
2	what can i say but that i experienced “ excellent service ”?!!
2	i will definitely make gear0music my first choice before looking elsewhere .
2	my only_regret was that i was not able to post this review a wee_bit earlier ( kids home , school_holidays ...!
2	).
2	a big " thank - you " to gear0music from a very grateful customer !
2	purchased this cream very good not oily and goes on smoothe over face and neck .
2	perfect as a moisturiser for putting on under foundation
2	i was extremely satisfied with the casserole_dishes i bought truly lovely have recommended them already to all my friends and family
2	i have dealt_with very for a long time , and i find them very fast reliant and helpful when you telephone them .
2	each order has arrived on the day that they tell you it will arrive
2	i have never had a problem with them , and all the goods that i have ordered have been very excellent value for money
2	i was really pleased with the service i have received from the costomers service down to the delivery drivers , the oak_worktop are great they just finish the kitchen off .
2	i '_ve just returned from an ' allocation on arrival ' holiday , and , as usual , olympic didn_'_t let_me down .
2	i ended_up on skiathos at ruela appartments , ideally_situated , very clean and comfortable .
2	i was on my own , with a two bedroom_apartment , and a huge balcony , the pool was superb , as was the bar , just a shame that they didn_'_t do the usual greek dishes there !
2	my only fault was the airline used , not the best , no option of on board meal , and very slow , limited bar service !
2	shopping in the lovely showroom , takes you back to , good old_fashioned service , from helpful , knowledgeable_staff , without the pressure .
2	the showrooms are so light and airy , fully modern and well_laid_out .
2	i couldn_'_t suggest anything to improve !
2	i have shopped at waitrose since we lived in banstead in the 0000 " s . i am a loyal and avid shopper at jl .
2	i have just received a disappointing order from waitrose meanwood for the easter_weekend .
2	a proportion of the fresh_produce was actually out of date the day after the deliver , this wouldn_'_t have bothered me so much if some of it hadn_'_t been exuding cream mush or was covered in black rot !
2	it was disgusting .
2	i emailed wait rose who sent a load of ridiculous excuses about how they could only deliver what they had - this outraged me as it seems they think its ok then to deliver rotting food ' if that all they have ' - utter_nonsense !!!!!
2	!
2	we have experienced problems in the meanwood store before with long waiting times at counters while staff ignore you , dried up uncovered food in the cafe and extremely rude staff , including one contact with the manager .
2	weekends are the worst when young teenagers are trying their best to manage a store .
2	avoid going and certainly avoid ordering a delivery .
2	go to harrogate instead , the store is cleaner , the food is fresher and the staff more helpful .
2	a bit premature asking for feedback before the goods have even arrived .
2	delivery is exceptionally slow and very disappointing .
2	i have never sold a lens before but reading about this company i thought why not , this lens had been unused since i changed my camera so i wouldnt miss it !
2	i decided to trade it in for another & mpb made it all so easy , free quote , free collection & free delivery , loads of friendly , helpfull & prompt emails & the lens i received was almost as new ..... i would recommend them to anyone who_wants reliability & no stress & would trade with them again !
2	second purchase from mr_central_heating , brilliant , fast service again wish all suppliers where like this
2	thank_you
2	we purchased a rangemaster built in oven .
2	the ordering was straught forward and the oven arrived quickly .
2	i would recommend cookers & ovens to other people looking to purchase leading_brands
2	very pleased with product and fast delivery .
2	ordered sunday .
2	arrived tuesday .
2	extremely fast and efficient
2	came exactly when you said at the time you said ............................ outstanding service :)
2	excellent fast service , good communication all the way through the buying process can not fault them
2	good sevice received order really quick .
2	lights are so nice , reasonably_priced .
2	delivery expensive though if you don_'_t spend £_00 .
2	i have used travel_republic a few_times and have never been let_down .
2	you can tailor make your holiday to suit .
2	transfers have always been there and on time .
2	a very trusting company .
2	i am delighted at the photobook that arrived from myphotographics this morning - a day earlier_than_anticipated .
2	the whole job has_been completed and delivered in less_than 00_hours from uploading onto their site - and i didnt even order the fastest service .
2	the quality of the photo_book and the printing has enhanced my images and has already impressed a potential_client i presented it to this morning .
2	i will most certainly be using this very professional company again and i am very grateful with all their help in completing this book so swiftly .
2	i have ordered several items many_times with viovet , especially the dog ear cleaning product as my dog suffers with yucky ears , they have always emailed confirming the order and tracking_details , with a very quick delivery .
2	i am happy to recomend them .
2	couldn_'_t be easier to get new tyres_fitted - all from the comfort of your armchair .
2	best deal on the internet , with a couple of bonus items thown - in for good measure .
2	exceptional communication of the order and delivery progress .
2	what more could you want ?
2	after an unfortunate problem ' out - of - stock ' issue on a previous purchase , despite having placed the product in my cart , guitarguitar redeemed_themselves with an offer another a similar ( though not as high_spec ) guitar , delivering a pristine guitar the next_day and crediting back my credit_card the day after that .
2	a very happy schecter guitar owner .
2	had not heard of his company before so did some_research and found most of the reviews were helpful and thought service was good we also read_reviews on the goods we require and as we had already decided what fridge_freezer we wanted we ordered it ( still need cooker and hood ) so still reading .
2	it was great you could choose a time_slot for delivery and opted for the green one which is they already have a delivery to make in our area so save energy and kind to global warming etc .
2	delivery men called hour before arriving our daughter said they were friendly and even_though they had to move a tv_cabinet slightly made no_fuss about it , unpacked and moved_into position gave her information on when we could use fridge and moved tv_cabinet back into place .
2	only down_side we now had a really large cardboard_box to get_rid of which would have been nice if they had taken_away with them , daughter ended_up walking it to local dump via the road haha
2	being invited to a birthday_party with fancy_dress theme of your choice but will be decorated in haloween style sent shivers down my spine as thoughts of usual scream masks and blood came to mind .
2	however knowing the guest is really scared of masks we looked through mega_fancy_dress and found brilliant octoberfest outfits for both me and hubby , had to go elsewhere for the beer stein handbag daughter is going as a green crayon which no - one has done ( out of our friends ).
2	quick delivery , wrapped well and better_than the description given .
2	will definitely use mega_fancy_dress again .
2	the process from home_trial to delivery was quick and efficient , the cost highly competative and the savings much_appreciated .
2	recommended !
2	a last_minute order which arrived promptly in time for christmas .
2	recommended .
2	i purchased a canvas as a birthday_present using a groupon_voucher .
2	the most difficult part of the process was choosing which photo to use in the first place - the order process was simple , delivery was quick and the quality outstrips the original photograph .
2	will happily order again .
2	ordered 0 easter_egg molds , which arrived 00_hours after ordering in perfect_condition .
2	easy to use and top_class results .
2	thanks !
2	i '_ve_used the train line on several occasion to buy cheaper tickets .
2	on the one occasion i had to phone them , they resolved the issue straight_away , were friendly , polite and very helpful .
2	this was our 0nd visit to oak_furniture_land waddon way .
2	and just wanted to say it was yet again the best service from the time we got in to the time we left .
2	by a lovely lady called teresa and again only taken a week to get our furniture , well_done oak you have got it so right .”

2	00 / 00 / 00 notification on discount site saying 0x000gm james_wellbeloved £ 0 . 00 , this was also to be seen posted by folk on the company '_s twitter feed !
2	so they knew it was out there .
2	same discount site had contacted to make_sure the offer was legit , and was advised by medicanimal cs that it was indeed correct .
2	on that basis i placed an order for 0 lots , i didn_'_t want to be greedy .
2	i presumed they had surplus stock .
2	fuming when a friend contacted me to say she had an_email cancelling her order .
2	i logged_into my medicanimal account to find they had cancelled mine with no notification at all !
2	i tweeted , i facebooked as i couldn_'_t get through on the phone and others were already saying they weren_'_t responding to emails !
2	today i have had an_email_saying they have refunded me .
2	they haven_'_t !
2	to be honest i don_'_t care about the refund .
2	you cannot say we did not have a contract when you took payment in_advance therefore i had not made an offer to purchase i had completed the purchase and you accepted it and were in contract when you accepted my money !
2	i will never buy from you again and will be telling_everyone i know about this debacle including trading_standards !
2	i ordered frontline for my cats .
2	was sick of paying a ridiculous price for it at the pet shop .
2	was delighted to get 0 pipettes for just slightly more ( 00p ) than the amount i pay for just 0 pipettes .
2	site was easy to navigate and delivery was very prompt , a couple of days i think !
2	brilliant and will definitely use it again .
2	i have already told my facebook friends about your company !
2	i found using the site very easy , good value for money and definitely cheaper_than_anywhere_else .
2	however , the courier used clearly did not read ( or maybe did not receive ) the explicit instruction left regarding delivery and leaving at a safe_place at my home , and i had to contact customer_services ( delivery ) on a number on which i only had push_button responses to use .
2	not acceptable on any level .
2	pet_supermarket did resolve it for me , but , will i use it again ?
2	probably not .
2	like most people i work for a living and the courier will only deliver mon - fri free of charge , if you want delivery on a saturday it is apparently £ 0 extra which would negate the saving i make on my pets food .
2	disappointing that this is not taken into account .
2	my dog prince will be on heart_tablets for the rest of his life , even with the vets consultation_fee and prescriptions i saved £_000 over a 0 month period .
2	as i hope this will be long_term as im not ready to lose my best friend , buying pet mrds online is more affordable .
2	service and delivery was very quick 0_star service .
2	excellent serice , very quick despatch and website very easy to use
2	the trophy i ordered was delivered quickly and the wording was all correct - great service !
2	excellent value , order was dealt_with swiftly and delivered on time as well .
2	very professional service from ordering to delivery , would recommend this company and the quality is very good .
2	we was look for something special to go with the gifts we bought for our dad on his 000th_birthday & this was perfect
2	the site is so easy to use , i like the way you can order samples to make it easier to see the colour '_s of the tiles , now all we have to do is pick the one we like & order the amount we need !!!
2	!
2	was really pleased with the goods , so much_cheaper_than the high_street , have only order the once but will be ordering again for our next trip_abroad
2	my son will be 00 this friday and and has asked for " another one of those baskets with all my favourites in please mum ".
2	so that '_s what he is getting , only in butch black basket this time to go in his games room for him to munch on whilst_playing .
2	expect he '_ll be getting one instead of a stocking this year too !
2	have never ordered a rug online before and was a bit_apprehensive .
2	glad to say rug is first_class better_than the picture , excellent quality , quick delivery .
2	now i know where to get all my rugs in the future .
2	great trader to deal with .
2	hunted_around for the best deals and found them here .
2	will definitely do_business again !
2	i found workwear_express very efficient .
2	our order was dealt_with quickly and sent out within they time they promised .
2	i was pleased with the artwork and initially with the t shirts we had ordered .
2	on closer_inspection , however , the t shirts were too short and after a couple of washes on 00 degree wash they had shrunk even more and had gone out of shape .
2	i would certainly order from work wear express again but would not order the type of t shirt purchased this time .
2	i placed an order with fragrance_direct .
2	it was delivered within a surprisingly short time .
2	i am very pleased with the product .
2	i would highly_recommend fragrance dir . ect
2	the person_who received the flowers told me ( by telephone ) that she was delighted with the beautiful flowers .
2	thank_you serenata !
2	after_searching numerous sites for flights and hotels for our trip to new_york , my head was in a whirl !
2	so i decided to give dial a flight a call .
2	everything was booked easily for me , exactly as i wanted and i knew that the price i was given was the price i would have to pay - no nasty_surprises later .
2	paperwork was sent through quickly and separate vouchers issued for each_step of the trip .
2	e_-_mails and phone_calls were received to check we were ready for our trip .
2	after looking for transfers from the airport to the hotel , i called dial a flight again and a transfer was booked for us which again ran absolutely smoothly .
2	elliott offered us excellent service and i will use them again ..
2	i always look at alpha_rooms ' website for hotels for a city_break and almost always end up booking with them .
2	we have had some varied hotels in terms of style , location and luxuiousness but we have never been really disapointed and have enjoyed every stay .
2	alphrooms offers good value for money and a good choice of hotels .
2	very easy to use web_site .

2	i recently_sold three old contract phones to mazumamobile which had just been lying_around collecting_dust .
2	i mistakenly thought they would be virtually worthless but having checked the mazumamobile website decided to sell them .
2	it was an easy , painless_procedure and a cheque arrived for the promised amount very quickly indeed .
2	altogether an excellent experience !
2	kept_informed at all_stages as to the delivery of the parcel .
2	arrived during the specified delivery time in good condition .
2	no_problems at all .

2	we ordered 0 single memory_foam mattresses .
2	superfast delivery , and well_packaged .
2	exactly as_described .
2	we have actually used them to replace our worn out garden lounger cushions which had become really uncomfortable .
2	they were easy to cut to size and we can now relax on our loungers in comfort again .
2	would definitely use this company again , fast and efficient service .
2	i buy stride plus for my bernese mountain dog at a very reasonable_price and the delivery is always very fast .
2	i find animeddirect to be excellent for a wide_range of prescription , non - prescription_medications and all other items required for your dogs .
2	they have a very simple and easy website to order from , you can upload your prescription and scan through and delivery is within 0 - 0_days on average .
2	they are one of the very best sites for dog_owners .
2	gail sherwood

2	great price , product received within days of order .
2	good communication_regarding delivery .
2	extremely happy with product .
2	i contacted glasses_direct as the high_street price for my new glasses almost gave_me a heart_attack !
2	£_000 is a lot of money in these tight times , yet i needed new glasses asap .
2	the glasses_direct website is fantastic - its easy to see the frames and i chose x0 on trial .
2	they arrived promptly and i had fun trying them on .
2	the pair i chose were lovely so ordered my prescription on line with no_fuss or bother .
2	to my delight they arrived within a week and prior to that i '_d had a call to check on the bi focals aspect .
2	i am absolutely_thrilled with my new glasses and the service provided .
2	am telling all my friends not to bother with the high_street .
2	very many_thanks from one happy customer .
2	this is the second time i have used viovet to get prescription_medicines for my cat and on both_occasions their service has_been faultless .
2	their website makes the process amazingly easy and speedy as i scan the prescription and send it as an attachment .
2	then the speed in which the order is processed is 0nd to none .
2	even with the christmas post they sent my order by 0st_class_post the same day as i ordered it and it was received by me the very next_day .
2	they are also extremely competitive on price .
2	thank_you !!
2	!
2	i won_`_t pay vets prices anymore for a long_term medical_condition for my elderly ridgeback , i simply get a prescription from my vet - at £ 0 ish and order 0 big bottles of metacam , at a very good price .
2	shipment has_been very efficient on both_times i have used them .
2	i will be back .
2	after_searching sites for a " reasonably_priced " pet odour eliminator , i decided to buy from pet_supermarket as i have used once before .
2	the reviews for my product - simple solution stain & odour remover for dogs 0 ltr were great so i decided to try for myself as my small male dog wees straight outside my back door day in day out .
2	when i open the back door for fresh_air , i usually have a to put up with smell of urine breezing into my home !
2	first day i poured it on neat and brushed it into concrete past the guinea_pig hutch - he pees there also !
2	and to my delight he now pees down the garden !
2	indoors he is not a problem but i like to add to my mop bucket - just in case .
2	i advise using it neat outside to quickly eliminate the offending pet weeing where they should n `_t .
2	works great for us and a nice pleasant smell .
2	will definitely be purchasing again plus i got free delivery - a win_win .
2	i recently bought 0 kong balls , large ones i might_add , within 00_minutes my 0 kilo puggle had found the squeaker and spat it out .
2	i rang medicanimal who sent a replacement .
2	all they required was photo proof which i downloaded .
2	the gent i spoke to was all you ` d expect from professional customer_services , efficient , polite , understanding , apologetic and listened .
2	i will be very happy to recommend medicanimal and use them again .
2	a joy to my ears and purse the extra 00_% made the purchase cheaper_than ebay !!!
2	thank_you .
2	from beginning to end oak_furniture solutions could not have performed any better .
2	we had a problem with the coffee_table .
2	firstly they got in a repairer .

2	all the sherwood range that we bought ( 0 items in all ) are gorgeous and all in all we couldn_'_t be_happier .
2	good price paid .

2	e_- outdoors is definitely going to be top of my search list from now on .
2	arrived well_packaged , purchased as a gift for my hubby .
2	recently_purchased a bean_bag and had to return it after 0weeks as it was faulty , excellent after sales service .
2	i purchased this product because i loved the design of the bottle .
2	this is a gift is for my husbands birhday which is not while august , so i cannot_comment on the fragrance yet .
2	i bought my tickets for simple minds for my daughter and i as a special treat .
2	they were quite exspensive but was really looking_forward to it .
2	the event in munich on 00nd of march was cancelled , viagogo didnt inform_me i found out from another website .
2	i requested a refund for my tickets but didnt hear_anything for a week , despite_numerous_emails to them and attempting to contact them by phone , not easy , as noone ever answers the phone . they have assured me that they would give me a full_refund as i am covered by the viagogo guarantee .
2	i am still_waiting , i have now taken it up with the credit_card co who have have assured me that they will dispute it .
2	i will never use them again , as have had events cancelled before and the cos refund within 00_hrs . this is now a few_weeks since the event was cancelled and the money has not been forthcoming .
2	the other thing is that even_though the event was cancelled i recieved an_email on the morning of the event wishing me an enjoyable time !!

2	what more could you ask for really !
2	i was delighted to find a company that sold ' real ' bottled ink in various colours and very pleased that the product was such a reasonable_price .
2	almost the same price as an ordinary bottle of blue / black_ink in smiths and i didn_'_t have to worry_about carrying it home on the bus .
2	thank_you will order more colours after christmas brilliant for pen and ink drawings !
2	pam gittins

2	!
2	my friend , jamie , and i drove to the shop , from middlesbrough , on 00 . 00 . 00 .
2	the place is like an_aladdin '_s cave - full of great stuff .
2	the staff were so friendly , leaving us to look around but were nearby if we needed any help .
2	we bought what we had gone for ( and more !)
2	i really appreciate the way orders are wrapped and sent promptly .

2	i have been using showroom_shine for a few_years_now and thoroughly_recommend this product as it does what it says .
2	originally ordered through amazon and was so impressed by the speed in which i received my order and the quality of the chocolates that i decided to order direct .
2	they have a good variety of chocolates to choose from and they taste absolutely_delicious .
2	when you order direct you can also earn loyalty_points which is an added_bonus as their prices are very reasonable .
2	i will certainly be re - ordering and have no_reservations whatsoever in recommending them to friends and family .
2	top quality items at a lower cost than high_street .
2	prompt delivery .
2	we certainly recommend .
2	ordered on line .

2	catherine was very helpful , and made me feel_confident that my parcel has_been sent through the right company .
2	the live_chat was very easy to use and i was talked_through everything online .
2	i would definitely use again and recommend .
2	thank_you catherine and parcel0go .
2	i needed to return a large parcel and decided to use citylink as they are quite a well_known company .
2	i waited in all day yesterday for a collection , still no collection yet this morning so i phoned interparcel .
2	com who i booked the collection through and was told there was nothing they could do and i would have to wait in all day again !
2	when i told them that i can '_t wait in all day and could they give me a approx time they said no city_link do not operate like that and they can '_t give approx times !!
2	i am fuming .
2	also remembered that i ordered something from amazon a year_ago and waited in for a delivery which once again didn_'_t arrive until the following evening !!
2	please do not use this firm !!!
2	!
2	i would recommend the womens earplug sample_pack .
2	although they didn_'_t totally block out the the loud cawing of crows on my bedroom roof they did help muffle the sound .
2	if earplugs can be a bit uncomfortable then this packmis for you because they come in different_sizes .
